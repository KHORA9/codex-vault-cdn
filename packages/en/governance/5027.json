Hayes\r\nDecember 3, 1877\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nWith devout gratitude to the bountiful Giver of All Good, I congratulate\r\nyou that at the beginning of your first regular session you find our\r\ncountry blessed with health and peace and abundant harvests, and with\r\nencouraging prospects of an early return of general prosperity.\r\n\r\nTo complete and make permanent the pacification of the country continues to\r\nbe, and until it is fully accomplished must remain, the most important of\r\nall our national interests. The earnest purpose of good citizens generally\r\nto unite their efforts in this endeavor is evident. It found decided\r\nexpression in the resolutions announced in 1876 by the national conventions\r\nof the leading political parties of the country. There was a widespread\r\napprehension that the momentous results in our progress as a nation marked\r\nby the recent amendments to the Constitution were in imminent jeopardy;\r\nthat the good understanding which prompted their adoption, in the interest\r\nof a loyal devotion to the general welfare, might prove a barren truce, and\r\nthat the two sections of the country, once engaged in civil strife, might\r\nbe again almost as widely severed and disunited as they were when arrayed\r\nin arms against each other.\r\n\r\nThe course to be pursued, which, in my judgment, seemed wisest in the\r\npresence of this emergency, was plainly indicated in my inaugural address.\r\nIt pointed to the time, which all our people desire to see, when a genuine\r\nlove of our whole country and of all that concerns its true welfare shall\r\nsupplant the destructive forces of the mutual animosity of races and of\r\nsectional hostility. Opinions have differed widely as to the measures best\r\ncalculated to secure this great end. This was to be expected. The measures\r\nadopted by the Administration have been subjected to severe and varied\r\ncriticism. Any course whatever which might have been entered upon would\r\ncertainly have encountered distrust and opposition. These measures were, in\r\nmy judgment, such as were most in harmony with the Constitution and with\r\nthe genius of our people, and best adapted, under all the circumstances, to\r\nattain the end in view. Beneficent results, already apparent, prove that\r\nthese endeavors are not to be regarded as a mere experiment, and should\r\nsustain and encourage us in our efforts. Already, in the brief period which\r\nhas elapsed, the immediate effectiveness, no less than the justice, of the\r\ncourse pursued is demonstrated, and I have an abiding faith that time will\r\nfurnish its ample vindication in the minds of the great majority of my\r\nfellow-citizens. The discontinuance of the use of the Army for the purpose\r\nof upholding local governments in two States of the Union was no less a\r\nconstitutional duty and requirement, under the circumstances existing at\r\nthe time, than it was a much-needed measure for the restoration of local\r\nself-government and the promotion of national harmony. The withdrawal of\r\nthe troops from such employment was effected deliberately, and with\r\nsolicitous care for the peace and good order of society and the protection\r\nof the property and persons and every right of all classes of citizens.\r\n\r\nThe results that have followed are indeed significant and encouraging. All\r\napprehension of danger from remitting those States to local self-government\r\nis dispelled, and a most salutary change in the minds of the people has\r\nbegun and is in progress in every part of that section of the country once\r\nthe theater of unhappy civil strife, substituting for suspicion, distrust,\r\nand aversion, concord, friendship, and patriotic attachment to the Union.\r\nNo unprejudiced mind will deny that the terrible and often fatal collisions\r\nwhich for several years have been of frequent occurrence and have agitated\r\nand alarmed the public mind have almost entirely ceased, and that a spirit\r\nof mutual forbearance and hearty national interest has succeeded. There has\r\nbeen a general reestablishment of order and of the orderly administration\r\nof justice. Instances of remaining lawlessness have become of rare\r\noccurrence; political turmoil and turbulence have disappeared; useful\r\nindustries have been resumed; public credit in the Southern States has been\r\ngreatly strengthened, and the encouraging benefits of a revival of commerce\r\nbetween the sections of the country lately embroiled in civil war are fully\r\nenjoyed. Such are some of the results already attained, upon which the\r\ncountry is to be congratulated. They are of such importance that we may\r\nwith confidence patiently await the desired consummation that will surely\r\ncome with the natural progress of events.\r\n\r\nIt may not be improper here to say that it should be our fixed and\r\nunalterable determination to protect by all available and proper means\r\nunder the Constitution and the laws the lately emancipated race in the\r\nenjoyment of their rights and privileges; and I urge upon those to whom\r\nheretofore the colored people have sustained the relation of bondmen the\r\nwisdom and justice of humane and liberal local legislation with respect to\r\ntheir education and general welfare. A firm adherence to the laws, both\r\nnational and State, as to the civil and political rights of the colored\r\npeople, now advanced to full and equal citizenship; the immediate\r\nrepression and sure punishment by the national and local authorities,\r\nwithin their respective jurisdictions, of every instance of lawlessness and\r\nviolence toward them, is required for the security alike of both races, and\r\nis justly demanded by the public opinion of the country and the age. In\r\nthis way the restoration of harmony and good will and the complete\r\nprotection of every citizen in the full enjoyment of every constitutional\r\nright will surely be attained. Whatever authority rests with me to this end\r\nI shall not hesitate to put forth.\r\n\r\nWhatever belongs to the power of Congress and the jurisdiction of the\r\ncourts of the Union, they may confidently be relied upon to provide and\r\nperform; and to the legislatures, the courts, and the executive authorities\r\nof the several States I earnestly appeal to secure, by adequate,\r\nappropriate, and seasonable means, Within their borders, these common and\r\nuniform rights of a united people which loves liberty, abhors oppression,\r\nand reveres justice. These objects are very dear to my heart. I shall\r\ncontinue most earnestly to strive for their attainment. The cordial\r\ncooperation of all classes, of all sections of the country and of both\r\nraces, is required for this purpose; and with these blessings assured, and\r\nnot otherwise, we may safely hope to hand down our free institutions of\r\ngovernment unimpaired to the generations that will succeed us.\r\n\r\nAmong the other subjects of great and general importance to the people of\r\nthis country, I can not be mistaken, I think, in regarding as preeminent\r\nthe policy and measures which are designed to secure the restoration of the\r\ncurrency to that normal and healthful condition in which, by the resumption\r\nof specie payments, our internal trade and foreign commerce may be brought\r\ninto harmony with the system of exchanges which is based upon the precious\r\nmetals as the intrinsic money of the world. In the public judgment that\r\nthis end should be sought and compassed as speedily and securely as the\r\nresources of the people and the wisdom of their Government can accomplish,\r\nthere is a much greater degree of unanimity than is found to concur in the\r\nspecific measures which will bring the country to this desired end or the\r\nrapidity of the steps by which it can be safely reached.\r\n\r\nUpon a most anxious and deliberate examination, which I have felt it my\r\nduty to give to the subject, I am but the more confirmed in the opinion\r\nwhich I expressed in accepting the nomination for the Presidency, and again\r\nupon my inauguration, that the policy of resumption should be pursued by\r\nevery suitable means, and that no legislation would be wise that should\r\ndisparage the importance or retard the attainment of that result. I have no\r\ndisposition, and certainly no right, to question the sincerity or the\r\nintelligence of opposing opinions, and would neither conceal nor undervalue\r\nthe considerable difficulties, and even occasional distresses, which may\r\nattend the progress of the nation toward this primary condition to its\r\ngeneral and permanent prosperity. I must, however, adhere to my most\r\nearnest conviction that any wavering in purpose or unsteadiness in methods,\r\nso far from avoiding or reducing the inconvenience inseparable from the\r\ntransition from an irredeemable to a redeemable paper currency, would only\r\ntend to increased and prolonged disturbance in values, and unless retrieved\r\nmust end in serious disorder, dishonor, and disaster in the financial\r\naffairs of the Government and of the people.\r\n\r\nThe mischiefs which I apprehend and urgently deprecate are confined to no\r\nclass of the people, indeed, but seem to me most certainly to threaten the\r\nindustrious masses, whether their occupations are of skilled or common\r\nlabor. To them, it seems to me, it is of prime importance that their labor\r\nshould be compensated in money which is itself fixed in exchangeable value\r\nby being irrevocably measured by the labor necessary to its production.\r\nThis permanent quality of the money of the people is sought for, and can\r\nonly be gained by the resumption of specie payments. The rich, the\r\nspeculative, the operating, the money-dealing classes may not always feel\r\nthe mischiefs of, or may find casual profits in, a variable currency, but\r\nthe misfortunes of such a currency to those who are paid salaries or wages\r\nare inevitable and remediless.\r\n\r\nClosely connected with this general subject of the resumption of specie\r\npayments is one of subordinate, but still of grave, importance; I mean the\r\nreadjustment of our coinage system by the renewal of the silver dollar as\r\nan element in our specie currency, endowed by legislation with the quality\r\nof legal tender to a greater or less extent.\r\n\r\nAs there is no doubt of the power of Congress under the Constitution \"to\r\ncoin money and regulate the value thereof,\" and as this power covers the\r\nwhole range of authority applicable to the metal, the rated value and the\r\nlegal-tender quality which shall be adopted for the coinage, the\r\nconsiderations which should induce or discourage a particular measure\r\nconnected with the coinage, belong clearly to the province of legislative\r\ndiscretion and of public expediency. Without intruding upon this province\r\nof legislation in the least, I have yet thought the subject of such\r\ncritical importance, in the actual condition of our affairs, as to present\r\nan occasion for the exercise of the duty imposed by the Constitution on the\r\nPresident of recommending to the consideration of Congress \"such measures\r\nas he shall judge necessary and expedient.\"\r\n\r\nHolding the opinion, as I do, that neither the interests of the Government\r\nnor of the people of the United States would be promoted by disparaging\r\nsilver as one of the two precious metals which furnish the coinage of the\r\nworld, and that legislation which looks to maintaining the volume of\r\nintrinsic money to as full a measure of both metals as their relative\r\ncommercial values will permit would be neither unjust nor inexpedient, I\r\nmust ask your indulgence to a brief and definite statement of certain\r\nessential features in any such legislative measure which I feel it my duty\r\nto recommend.\r\n\r\nI do not propose to enter the debate, represented on both sides by such\r\nable disputants in Congress and before the people and in the press, as to\r\nthe extent to which the legislation of any one nation can control this\r\nquestion, even within its own borders, against the unwritten laws of trade\r\nor the positive laws of other governments. The wisdom of Congress in\r\nshaping any particular law that may be presented for my approval may wholly\r\nsupersede the necessity of my entering into these considerations, and I\r\nwillingly avoid either vague or intricate inquiries. It is only certain\r\nplain and practical traits of such legislation that I desire to recommend\r\nto your attention.\r\n\r\nIn any legislation providing for a silver coinage, regulating its value,\r\nand imparting to it the quality of legal tender, it seems to me of great\r\nimportance that Congress should not lose sight of its action as operating\r\nin a twofold capacity and in two distinct directions. If the United States\r\nGovernment were free from a public debt, its legislative dealing with the\r\nquestion of silver coinage would be purely sovereign and governmental,\r\nunder no restraints but those of constitutional power and the public good\r\nas affected by the proposed legislation. But in the actual circumstances of\r\nthe nation, with a vast public debt distributed very widely among our own\r\ncitizens and held in great amounts also abroad, the nature of the\r\nsilver-coinage measure, as affecting this relation of the Government to the\r\nholders of the public debt, becomes an element, in any proposed\r\nlegislation, of the highest concern. The obligation of the public faith\r\ntranscends all questions of profit or public advantage otherwise. Its\r\nunquestionable maintenance is the dictate as well of the highest expediency\r\nas of the most necessary duty, and will ever be carefully guarded by\r\nCongress and people alike.\r\n\r\nThe public debt of the United States to the amount of $729,000,000 bears\r\ninterest at the rate of 6 per cent, and $708,000,000 at the rate of 5 per\r\ncent, and the only way in which the country can be relieved from the\r\npayment of these high rates of interest is by advantageously refunding the\r\nindebtedness. Whether the debt is ultimately paid in gold or in silver coin\r\nis of but little moment compared with the possible reduction of interest\r\none-third by refunding it at such reduced rate. If the United States had\r\nthe unquestioned right to pay its bonds in silver coin, the little benefit\r\nfrom that process would be greatly overbalanced by the injurious effect of\r\nsuch payment if made or proposed against the honest convictions of the\r\npublic creditors.\r\n\r\nAll the bonds that have been issued since February 12, 1873, when gold\r\nbecame the only unlimited legal-tender metallic currency of the country,\r\nare justly payable in gold coin or in coin of equal value. During the time\r\nof these issues the only dollar that could be or was received by the\r\nGovernment in exchange for bonds was the gold dollar. To require the public\r\ncreditors to take in repayment any dollar of less commercial value would be\r\nregarded by them as a repudiation of the full obligation assumed. The bonds\r\nissued prior to 1873 were issued at a time when the gold dollar was the\r\nonly coin in circulation or contemplated by either the Government or the\r\nholders of the bonds as the coin in which they were to be paid. It is far\r\nbetter to pay these bonds in that coin than to seem to take advantage of\r\nthe unforeseen fall in silver bullion to pay in a new issue of silver coin\r\nthus made so much less valuable. The power of the United States to coin\r\nmoney and to regulate the value thereof ought never to be exercised for the\r\npurpose of enabling the Government to pay its obligations in a coin of less\r\nvalue than that contemplated by the parties when the bonds were issued. Any\r\nattempt to pay the national indebtedness in a coinage of less commercial\r\nvalue than the money of the world would involve a violation of the public\r\nfaith and work irreparable injury to the public credit.\r\n\r\nIt was the great merit of the act of March, 1869, in strengthening the\r\npublic credit, that it removed all doubt as to the purpose of the United\r\nStates to pay their bonded debt in coin. That act was accepted as a pledge\r\nof public faith. The Government has derived great benefit from it in the\r\nprogress thus far made in refunding the public debt at low rates of\r\ninterest. An adherence to the wise and just policy of an exact observance\r\nof the public faith will enable the Government rapidly to reduce the burden\r\nof interest on the national debt to an amount exceeding $20,000,000 per\r\nannum, and effect an aggregate saving to the United States of more than\r\n$300,000,000 before the bonds can be fully paid.\r\n\r\nIn adapting the new silver coinage to the ordinary uses of currency in the\r\neveryday transactions of life and prescribing the quality of legal tender\r\nto be assigned to it, a consideration of the first importance should be so\r\nto adjust the ratio between the silver and the gold coinage, which now\r\nconstitutes our specie currency, as to accomplish the desired end of\r\nmaintaining the circulation of the two metallic currencies and keeping up\r\nthe volume of the two precious metals as our intrinsic money. It is a mixed\r\nquestion, for scientific reasoning and historical experience to determine,\r\nhow far and by what methods a practical equilibrium can be maintained which\r\nwill keep both metals in circulation in their appropriate spheres of common\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nAn absolute equality of commercial value, free from disturbing\r\nfluctuations, is hardly attainable, and without it an unlimited legal\r\ntender for private transactions assigned to both metals would irresistibly\r\ntend to drive out of circulation the clearer coinage and disappoint the\r\nprincipal object proposed by the legislation in view. I apprehend,\r\ntherefore, that the two conditions of a near approach to equality of\r\ncommercial value between the gold and silver coinage of the same\r\ndenomination and of a limitation of the amounts for which the silver\r\ncoinage is to be a legal tender are essential to maintaining both in\r\ncirculation. If these conditions can be successfully observed, the issue\r\nfrom the mint of silver dollars would afford material assistance to the\r\ncommunity in the transition to redeemable paper money, and would facilitate\r\nthe resumption of specie payment and its permanent establishment. Without\r\nthese conditions I fear that only mischief and misfortune would flow from a\r\ncoinage of silver dollars with the quality of unlimited legal tender, even\r\nin private transactions.\r\n\r\nAny expectation of temporary ease from an issue of silver coinage to pass\r\nas a legal tender at a rate materially above its commercial value is, I am\r\npersuaded, a delusion. Nor can I think that there is any substantial\r\ndistinction between an original issue of silver dollars at a nominal value\r\nmaterially above their commercial value and the restoration of the silver\r\ndollar at a rate which once was, but has ceased to be, its commercial\r\nvalue. Certainly the issue of our gold coinage, reduced in weight\r\nmaterially below its legal-tender value, would not be any the less a\r\npresent debasement of the coinage by reason of its equaling, or even\r\nexceeding, in weight a gold coinage which at some past time had been\r\ncommercially equal to the legal-tender value assigned to the new issue.\r\n\r\nIn recommending that the regulation of any silver coinage which may be\r\nauthorized by Congress should observe these conditions of commercial value\r\nand limited legal tender, I am governed by the feeling that every possible\r\nincrease should be given to the volume of metallic money which can be kept\r\nin circulation, and thereby every possible aid afforded to the people in\r\nthe process of resuming specie payments. It is because of my firm\r\nconviction that a disregard of these conditions would frustrate the good\r\nresults which are desired from the proposed coinage, and embarrass with new\r\nelements of confusion and uncertainty the business of the country, that I\r\nurge upon your attention these considerations.\r\n\r\nI respectfully recommend to Congress that in any legislation providing for\r\na silver coinage and imparting to it the quality of legal tender there be\r\nimpressed upon the measure a firm provision exempting the public debt\r\nheretofore issued and now outstanding from payment, either of principal or\r\ninterest, in any coinage of less commercial value than the present gold\r\ncoinage of the country.\r\n\r\nThe organization of the civil service of the country has for a number of\r\nyears attracted more and more of the public attention. So general has\r\nbecome the opinion that the methods of admission to it and the conditions\r\nof remaining in it are unsound that both the great political parties have\r\nagreed in the most explicit declarations of the necessity of reform and in\r\nthe most emphatic demands for it. I have fully believed these declarations\r\nand demands to be the expression of a sincere conviction of the intelligent\r\nmasses of the people upon the subject, and that they should be recognized\r\nand followed by earnest and prompt action on the part of the legislative\r\nand executive departments of the Government, in pursuance of the purpose\r\nindicated.\r\n\r\nBefore my accession to office I endeavored to have my own views distinctly\r\nunderstood, and upon my inauguration my accord with the public opinion was\r\nstated in terms believed to be plain and unambiguous. My experience in the\r\nexecutive duties has strongly confirmed the belief in the great advantage\r\nthe country would find in observing strictly the plan of the Constitution,\r\nwhich imposes upon the Executive the sole duty and responsibility of the\r\nselection of those Federal officers who by law are appointed, not elected,\r\nand which in like manner assigns to the Senate the complete right to advise\r\nand consent to or to reject the nominations so made, whilst the House of\r\nRepresentatives stands as the public censor of the performance of official\r\nduties, with the prerogative of investigation and prosecution in all cases\r\nof dereliction. The blemishes and imperfections in the civil service may,\r\nas I think, be traced in most cases to a practical confusion of the duties\r\nassigned to the several Departments of the Government. My purpose in this\r\nrespect has been to return to the system established by the fundamental\r\nlaw, and to do this with the heartiest cooperation and most cordial\r\nunderstanding with the Senate and House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nThe practical difficulties in the selection of numerous officers for posts\r\nof widely varying responsibilities and duties are acknowledged to be very\r\ngreat. No system can be expected to secure absolute freedom from mistakes,\r\nand the beginning of any attempted change of custom is quite likely to be\r\nmore embarrassed in this respect than any subsequent period. It is here\r\nthat the Constitution seems to me to prove its claim to the great wisdom\r\naccorded to it. It gives to the Executive the assistance of the knowledge\r\nand experience of the Senate, which, when acting upon nominations as to\r\nwhich they may be disinterested and impartial judges, secures as strong a\r\nguaranty of freedom from errors of importance as is perhaps possible in\r\nhuman affairs.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, I recognize the public advantage of making all\r\nnominations, as nearly as possible, impersonal, in the sense of being free\r\nfrom mere caprice or favor in the selection; and in those offices in which\r\nspecial training is of greatly increased value I believe such a rule as to\r\nthe tenure of office should obtain as may induce men of proper\r\nqualifications to apply themselves industriously to the task of becoming\r\nproficients. Bearing these things in mind, I have endeavored to reduce the\r\nnumber of changes in subordinate places usually made upon the change of the\r\ngeneral administration, and shall most heartily cooperate with Congress in\r\nthe better systematizing of such methods and rules of admission to the\r\npublic service and of promotion within it as, may promise to be most\r\nsuccessful in making thorough competency, efficiency, and character the\r\ndecisive tests in these matters.\r\n\r\nI ask the renewed attention of Congress to what has already been done by\r\nthe Civil Service Commission, appointed, in pursuance of an act of\r\nCongress, by my predecessor, to prepare and revise civil-service rules. In\r\nregard to much of the departmental service, especially at Washington, it\r\nmay be difficult to organize a better system than that which has thus been\r\nprovided, and it is now being used to a considerable extent under my\r\ndirection. The Commission has still a legal existence, although for several\r\nyears no appropriation has been made for defraying its expenses. Believing\r\nthat this Commission has rendered valuable service and will be a most\r\nuseful agency in improving the administration of the civil service, I\r\nrespectfully recommend that a suitable appropriation, to be immediately\r\navailable, be made to enable it to continue its labors.\r\n\r\nIt is my purpose to transmit to Congress as early as practicable a report\r\nby the chairman of the Commission, and to ask your attention to such\r\nmeasures on this subject as in my opinion will further promote the\r\nimprovement of the civil service.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year the United States have continued to maintain peaceful\r\nrelations with foreign powers.\r\n\r\nThe outbreak of war between Russia and Turkey, though at one time attended\r\nby grave apprehension as to its effect upon other European nations, has had\r\nno tendency to disturb the amicable relations existing between the United\r\nStates and each of the two contending powers. An attitude of just and\r\nimpartial neutrality has been preserved, and I am gratified to state that\r\nin the midst of their hostilities both the Russian and the Turkish\r\nGovernments have shown an earnest disposition to adhere to the obligations\r\nof all treaties with the United States and to give due regard to the rights\r\nof American citizens.\r\n\r\nBy the terms of the treaty defining the rights, immunities, and privileges\r\nof consuls, between Italy and the United States, ratified in 1868, either\r\nGovernment may, after the lapse of ten years, terminate the existence of\r\nthe treaty by giving twelve months' notice of its intention. The Government\r\nof Italy, availing itself of this faculty, has now given the required\r\nnotice, and the treaty will accordingly end on the 17th of September, 1878.\r\nIt is understood, however, that the Italian Government wishes to renew it\r\nin its general scope, desiring only certain modifications in some of its\r\narticles. In this disposition I concur, and shall hope that no serious\r\nobstacles may intervene to prevent or delay the negotiation of a\r\nsatisfactory treaty.\r\n\r\nNumerous questions in regard to passports, naturalization, and exemption\r\nfrom military service have continued to arise in cases of emigrants from\r\nGermany who have returned to their native country. The provisions of the\r\ntreaty of February 22, 1868, however, have proved to be so ample and so\r\njudicious that the legation of the United States at Berlin has been able to\r\nadjust all claims arising under it, not only without detriment to the\r\namicable relations existing between the two Governments, but, it is\r\nbelieved, without injury or injustice to any duly naturalized American\r\ncitizen. It is desirable that the treaty originally made with the North\r\nGerman Union in 1868 should now be extended so as to apply equally to all\r\nthe States of the Empire of Germany.\r\n\r\nThe invitation of the Government of France to participate in the Exposition\r\nof the Products of Agriculture, Industry, and the Fine Arts to be held at\r\nParis during the coming year was submitted for your consideration at the\r\nextra session. It is not doubted that its acceptance by the United States,\r\nand a well-selected exhibition of the products of American industry on that\r\noccasion, will tend to stimulate international commerce and emigration, as\r\nwell as to promote the traditional friendship between the two countries.\r\n\r\nA question arose some time since as to the proper meaning of the\r\nextradition articles of the treaty of 1842 between the United States and\r\nGreat Britain. Both Governments, however, are now in accord in the belief\r\nthat the question is not one that should be allowed to frustrate the ends\r\nof justice or to disturb the friendship between the two nations. No serious\r\ndifficulty has arisen in accomplishing the extradition of criminals when\r\nnecessary. It is probable that all points of disagreement will in due time\r\nbe settled, and, if need be, more explicit declarations be made in a new\r\ntreaty.\r\n\r\nThe Fishery Commission under Articles XVIII to XXV of the treaty of\r\nWashington has concluded its session at Halifax. The result of the\r\ndeliberations of the commission, as made public by the commissioners, will\r\nbe communicated to Congress.\r\n\r\nA treaty for the protection of trade-marks has been negotiated with Great\r\nBritain, which has been submitted to the Senate for its consideration.\r\n\r\nThe revolution which recently occurred in Mexico was followed by the\r\naccession of the successful party to power and the installation of its\r\nchief, General Porfirio Diaz, in the Presidential office. It has been the\r\ncustom of the United States, when such changes of government have\r\nheretofore occurred in Mexico, to recognize and enter into official\r\nrelations with the de facto government as soon as it should appear to have\r\nthe approval of the Mexican people and should manifest a disposition to\r\nadhere to the obligations of treaties and international friendship. In the\r\npresent case such official recognition has been deferred by the occurrences\r\non the Rio Grande border, the records of which have been already\r\ncommunicated to each House of Congress in answer to their respective\r\nresolutions of inquiry. Assurances have been received that the authorities\r\nat the seat of the Mexican Government have both the disposition and the\r\npower to prevent and punish such unlawful invasions and depredations. It is\r\nearnestly to be hoped that events may prove these assurances to be well\r\nrounded. The best interests of both countries require the maintenance of\r\npeace upon the border and the development of commerce between the two\r\nRepublics.\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to add that this temporary interruption of official\r\nrelations has not prevented due attention by the representatives of the\r\nUnited States in Mexico to the protection of American citizens, so far as\r\npracticable; nor has it interfered with the prompt payment of the amounts\r\ndue from Mexico to the United States under the treaty of July 4, 1868, and\r\nthe awards of the joint commission. While I do not anticipate an\r\ninterruption of friendly relations with Mexico, yet I can not but look with\r\nsome solicitude upon a continuance of border disorders as exposing the two\r\ncountries to initiations of popular feeling and mischances of action which\r\nare naturally unfavorable to complete amity. Firmly determined that nothing\r\nshall be wanting on my part to promote a good understanding between the two\r\nnations, I yet must ask the attention of Congress to the actual occurrences\r\non the border, that the lives and property of our citizens may be\r\nadequately protected and peace preserved.\r\n\r\nAnother year has passed without bringing to a close the protracted contest\r\nbetween the Spanish Government and the insurrection in the island of Cuba.\r\nWhile the United States have sedulously abstained from any intervention in\r\nthis contest, it is impossible not to feel that it is attended with\r\nincidents affecting the rights and interests of American citizens. Apart\r\nfrom the effect of the hostilities upon trade between the United States and\r\nCuba, their progress is inevitably accompanied by complaints, having more\r\nor less foundation, of searches, arrests, embargoes, and oppressive taxes\r\nupon the property of American residents, and of unprovoked interference\r\nwith American vessels and commerce. It is due to the Government of Spain to\r\nsay that during the past year it has promptly disavowed and offered\r\nreparation for any unauthorized acts of unduly zealous subordinates\r\nwhenever such acts have been brought to its attention. Nevertheless, such\r\noccurrences can not but tend to excite feelings of annoyance, suspicion,\r\nand resentment, which are greatly to be deprecated, between the respective\r\nsubjects and citizens of two friendly powers.\r\n\r\nMuch delay (consequent upon accusations of fraud in some of the awards) has\r\noccurred in respect to the distribution of the limited amounts received\r\nfrom Venezuela under the treaty of April 25, 1866, applicable to the awards\r\nof the joint commission created by that treaty. So long as these matters\r\nare pending in Congress the Executive can not assume either to pass upon\r\nthe questions presented or to distribute the fund received. It is eminently\r\ndesirable that definite legislative action should be taken, either\r\naffirming the awards to be final or providing some method for reexamination\r\nof the claims. Our relations with the Republics of Central and South\r\nAmerica and with the Empire of Brazil have continued without serious\r\nchange, further than the temporary interruption of diplomatic intercourse\r\nwith Venezuela and with Guatemala. Amicable relations have already been\r\nfully restored with Venezuela, and it is not doubted that all grounds of\r\nmisunderstanding with Guatemala will speedily be removed. From all these\r\ncountries there are favorable indications of a disposition on the part of\r\ntheir Governments and people to reciprocate our efforts in the direction of\r\nincreased commercial intercourse.\r\n\r\nThe Government of the Samoan Islands has sent an envoy, in the person of\r\nits secretary of state, to invite the Government of the United States to\r\nrecognize and protect their independence, to establish commercial relations\r\nwith their people, and to assist them in their steps toward regulated and\r\nresponsible government. The inhabitants of these islands, having made\r\nconsiderable progress in Christian civilization and the development of\r\ntrade, are doubtful of their ability to maintain peace and independence\r\nwithout the aid of some stronger power. The subject is deemed worthy of\r\nrespectful attention, and the claims upon our assistance by this distant\r\ncommunity will be carefully considered.\r\n\r\nThe long commercial depression in the United States has directed attention\r\nto the subject of the possible increase of our foreign trade and the\r\nmethods for its development, not only with Europe, but with other\r\ncountries, and especially with the States and sovereignties of the Western\r\nHemisphere. Instructions from the Department of State were issued to the\r\nvarious diplomatic and consular officers of the Government, asking them to\r\ndevote attention to the question of methods by which trade between the\r\nrespective countries of their official residence and the United States\r\ncould be most judiciously fostered. In obedience to these instructions,\r\nexaminations and reports upon this subject have been made by many of these\r\nofficers and transmitted to the Department, and the same are submitted to\r\nthe consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe annual report of the Secretary of the Treasury on the state of the\r\nfinances presents important questions for the action of Congress, upon some\r\nof which I have already remarked.\r\n\r\nThe revenues of the Government during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1877,\r\nwere $269,000,586.62; the total expenditures for the same period were\r\n$238,660,008.93, leaving a surplus revenue of $30,340,577.69. This has\r\nsubstantially supplied the requirements of the sinking fund for that year.\r\nThe estimated revenues of the current fiscal year are $265,500,000, and the\r\nestimated expenditures for the same period are $232,430,643.72. If these\r\nestimates prove to be correct, there will be a surplus revenue of\r\n$33,069,356.28--an amount nearly sufficient for the sinking fund for that\r\nyear. The estimated revenues for the next fiscal year are $269,250,000. It\r\nappears from the report that during the last fiscal year the revenues of\r\nthe Government, compared with the previous year, have largely decreased.\r\nThis decrease, amounting to the sum of $18,481,452.54, was mainly in\r\ncustoms duties, caused partly by a large falling off of the amount of\r\nimported dutiable goods and partly by the general fall of prices in the\r\nmarkets of production of such articles as pay ad valorem taxes.\r\n\r\nWhile this is felt injuriously in the diminution of the revenue, it has\r\nbeen accompanied with a very large increase of exportations. The total\r\nexports during the last fiscal year, including coin, have been\r\n$658,637,457, and the imports have been $492,097,540, leaving a balance of\r\ntrade in favor of the United States amounting to the sum of $166,539,917,\r\nthe beneficial effects of which extend to all branches of business.\r\n\r\nThe estimated revenue for the next fiscal year will impose upon Congress\r\nthe duty of strictly limiting appropriations, including the requisite sum\r\nfor the maintenance of the sinking fund, within the aggregate estimated\r\nreceipts.\r\n\r\nWhile the aggregate of taxes should not be increased, amendments might be\r\nmade to the revenue laws that would, without diminishing the revenue,\r\nrelieve the people from unnecessary burdens. A tax on tea and coffee is\r\nshown by the experience not only of our own country, but of other\r\ncountries, to be easily collected, without loss by undervaluation or fraud,\r\nand largely borne in the country of production. A tax of 10 cents a pound\r\non tea and 2 cents a pound on coffee would produce a revenue exceeding\r\n$12,000,000, and thus enable Congress to repeal a multitude of annoying\r\ntaxes yielding a revenue not exceeding that sum. The internal-revenue\r\nsystem grew out of the necessities of the war, and most of the legislation\r\nimposing taxes upon domestic products under this system has been repealed.\r\nBy the substitution of a tax on tea and coffee all forms of internal\r\ntaxation may be repealed, except that on whisky, spirits, tobacco, and\r\nbeer. Attention is also called to the necessity of enacting more vigorous\r\nlaws for the protection of the revenue and for the punishment of frauds and\r\nsmuggling. This can best be done by judicious provisions that will induce\r\nthe disclosure of attempted fraud by undervaluation and smuggling. All\r\nrevenue laws should be simple in their provisions and easily understood. So\r\nfar as practicable, the rates of taxation should be in the form of specific\r\nduties, and not ad valorem, requiring the judgment of experienced men to\r\nascertain values and exposing the revenue to the temptation of fraud.\r\n\r\nMy attention has been called during the recess of Congress to abuses\r\nexisting in the collection of the customs, and strenuous efforts have been\r\nmade for their correction by Executive orders. The recommendations\r\nsubmitted to the Secretary of the Treasury by a commission appointed to\r\nexamine into the collection of customs duties at the port of New York\r\ncontain many suggestions for the modification of the customs laws, to which\r\nthe attention of Congress is invited.\r\n\r\nIt is matter of congratulation that notwithstanding the severe burdens\r\ncaused by the war the public faith with all creditors has been preserved,\r\nand that as the result of this policy the public credit has continuously\r\nadvanced and our public securities are regarded with the highest favor in\r\nthe markets of the world. I trust that no act of the Government will cast a\r\nshadow upon its credit.\r\n\r\nThe progress of refunding the public debt has been rapid and satisfactory.\r\nUnder the contract existing when I entered upon the discharge of the duties\r\nof my office, bonds bearing interest at the rate of 4 1/2 per cent were\r\nbeing rapidly sold, and within three months the aggregate sales of these\r\nbonds had reached the sum of $200,000,000. With my sanction the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury entered into a new contract for the sale of 4 per cent\r\nbonds, and within thirty days after the popular subscription for such bonds\r\nwas opened subscriptions were had amounting to $75,496,550, which were paid\r\nfor within ninety days after the date of subscription. By this process,\r\nwithin but little more than one year, the annual interest on the public\r\ndebt was reduced in the sum of $3,775,000.\r\n\r\nI recommended that suitable provision be made to enable the people to\r\neasily convert their savings into Government securities, as the best mode\r\nin which small savings may be well secured and yield a moderate interest.\r\nIt is an object of public policy to retain among our own people the\r\nsecurities of the United States. In this way our country is guarded against\r\ntheir sudden return from foreign countries, caused by war or other\r\ndisturbances beyond our limits.\r\n\r\nThe commerce of the United States with foreign nations, and especially the\r\nexport of domestic productions, has of late years largely increased; but\r\nthe greater portion of this trade is conducted in foreign vessels. The\r\nimportance of enlarging our foreign trade, and especially by direct and\r\nspeedy interchange with countries on this continent, can not be\r\noverestimated; and it is a matter of great moment that our own shipping\r\ninterest should receive, to the utmost practical extent, the benefit of our\r\ncommerce with other lands. These considerations are forcibly urged by all\r\nthe large commercial cities of the country, and public attention is\r\ngenerally and wisely attracted to the solution of the problems they\r\npresent. It is not doubted that Congress will take them up in the broadest\r\nspirit of liberality and respond to the public demand by practical\r\nlegislation upon this important subject.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of War shows that the Army has been actively\r\nemployed during the year, and has rendered very important service in\r\nsuppressing hostilities in the Indian country and in preserving peace and\r\nprotecting life and property in the interior as well as along the Mexican\r\nborder. A long and arduous campaign has been prosecuted, with final\r\ncomplete success, against a portion of the Nez Perce tribe of Indians. A\r\nfull account of this campaign will be found in the report of the General of\r\nthe Army. It will be seen that in its course several severe battles were\r\nfought, in which a number of gallant officers and men lost their lives. I\r\njoin with the Secretary of War and the General of the Army in awarding to\r\nthe officers and men employed in the long and toilsome pursuit and in the\r\nfinal capture of these Indians the honor and praise which are so justly\r\ntheir due.\r\n\r\nThe very serious riots which occurred in several of the States in July last\r\nrendered necessary the employment of a considerable portion of the Army to\r\npreserve the peace and maintain order. In the States of West Virginia,\r\nMaryland, Pennsylvania, and Illinois these disturbances were so formidable\r\nas to defy the local and State authorities, and the National Executive was\r\ncalled upon, in the mode provided by the Constitution and laws, to furnish\r\nmilitary aid. I am gratified to be able to state that the troops sent in\r\nresponse to these calls for aid in the suppression of domestic violence\r\nwere able, by the influence of their presence in the disturbed regions, to\r\npreserve the peace and restore order without the use of force. In the\r\ndischarge of this delicate and important duty both officers and men acted\r\nwith great prudence and courage, and for their services deserve the thanks\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\nDisturbances along the Rio Grande in Texas, to which I have already\r\nreferred, have rendered necessary the constant employment of a military\r\nforce in that vicinity. A full report of all recent military operations in\r\nthat quarter has been transmitted to the House of Representatives in answer\r\nto a resolution of that body, and it will therefore not be necessary to\r\nenter into details. I regret to say that these lawless incursions into our\r\nterritory by armed bands from the Mexican side of the line, for the purpose\r\nof robbery, have been of frequent occurrence, and in spite of the most\r\nvigilant efforts of the commander of our forces the marauders have\r\ngenerally succeeded in escaping into Mexico with their plunder. In May last\r\nI gave orders for the exercise of the utmost vigilance on the part of our\r\ntroops for the suppression of these raids and the punishment of the guilty\r\nparties, as well as the recapture of property stolen by them. General Ord,\r\ncommanding in Texas, was directed to invite the cooperation of the Mexican\r\nauthorities in efforts to this end, and to assure them that I was anxious\r\nto avoid giving the least offense to Mexico. At the same time, he was\r\ndirected to give notice of my determination to put an end to the invasion\r\nof our territory by lawless bands intent upon the plunder of our peaceful\r\ncitizens, even if the effectual punishment of the outlaws should make the\r\ncrossing of the border by our troops in their pursuit necessary. It is\r\nbelieved that this policy has had the effect to check somewhat these\r\ndepredations, and that with a considerable increase of our force upon that\r\nfrontier and the establishment of several additional military posts along\r\nthe Rio Grande, so as more effectually to guard that extensive border,\r\npeace may be preserved and the lives and property of our citizens in Texas\r\nfully protected.\r\n\r\nPrior to the 1st day of July last the Army was, in accordance with law,\r\nreduced to the maximum of 25,000 enlisted men, being a reduction of 2,500\r\nbelow the force previously authorized. This reduction was made, as required\r\nby law, entirely from the infantry and artillery branches of the service,\r\nwithout any reduction of the cavalry. Under the law as it now stands it is\r\nnecessary that the cavalry regiments be recruited to 100 men in each\r\ncompany for service on the Mexican and Indian frontiers. The necessary\r\neffect of this legislation is to reduce the infantry and artillery arms of\r\nthe service below the number required for efficiency, and I concur with the\r\nSecretary of War in recommending that authority be given to recruit all\r\ncompanies of infantry to at least 50 men and all batteries of artillery to\r\nat least 75 men, with the power, in case of emergency, to increase the\r\nformer to 100 and the latter to 122 men each.\r\n\r\nI invite your special attention to the following recommendations of the\r\nSecretary of War:\r\n\r\nFirst. That provision be made for supplying to the Army a more abundant and\r\nbetter supply of reading matter.\r\n\r\nSecond. That early action be taken by Congress looking to a complete\r\nrevision and republication of the Army Regulations.\r\n\r\nThird. That section 1258 of the Revised Statutes, limiting the number of\r\nofficers on the retired list, be repealed.\r\n\r\nFourth. That the claims arising under the act of July 4, 1864, for supplies\r\ntaken by the Army during the war, be taken from the offices of the\r\nQuartermaster and Commissary Generals and transferred to the Southern\r\nClaims Commission, or some other tribunal having more time and better\r\nfacilities for their prompt investigation and decision than are possessed\r\nby these officers.\r\n\r\nFifth. That Congress provide for an annuity fund for the families of\r\ndeceased soldiers, as recommended by the paymaster-General of the Army.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Navy shows that we have six squadrons\r\nnow engaged in the protection of our foreign commerce and other duties\r\npertaining to the naval service. The condition and operations of the\r\nDepartment are also shown. The total expenditures for the fiscal year\r\nending June 30, 1877, were $16,077,974.54. There are unpaid claims against\r\nthe Department chargeable to the last year, which are presented to the\r\nconsideration of Congress by the report of the Secretary. The estimates for\r\nthe fiscal year commencing July 1, 1878, are $16,233,234.40, exclusive of\r\nthe sum of $2,314,231 submitted for new buildings, repairs, and\r\nimprovements at the several navy-yards. The appropriations for the present\r\nfiscal year, commencing July 1, 1877, are $13,592,932.90. The amount drawn\r\nfrom the Treasury from July 1 to November 1, 1877, is $5,343,037.40, of\r\nwhich there is estimated to be yet available $1,029,528.30, showing the\r\namount of actual expenditure during the first four months of the present\r\nfiscal year to have been $4,313,509.10.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster-General contains a full and clear statement of\r\nthe operations and condition of the Post-Office Department. The ordinary\r\nrevenues of the Department for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1877,\r\nincluding receipts from the money-order business and from official stamps\r\nand stamped envelopes, amounted to the sum of $27,531,585.26. The\r\nadditional sum of $7,013,000 was realized from appropriations from the\r\ngeneral Treasury for various purposes, making the receipts from all sources\r\n$34,544,885.26. The total expenditures during the fiscal year amounted to\r\n$33,486,322.44, leaving an excess of total receipts over total expenditures\r\nof $1,058,562.82, and an excess of total expenditures over ordinary\r\nreceipts of $5,954,737.18. Deducting from the total receipts the sum of\r\n$63,261.84, received from international money orders of the preceding\r\nfiscal year, and deducting from the total expenditures the sum of\r\n$1,163,818.20, paid on liabilities incurred in previous fiscal years, the\r\nexpenditures and receipts appertaining to the business of the last fiscal\r\nyear were as follows:\r\n\r\nExpenditures - $32,322,504.24\r\n\r\nReceipts (ordinary, from money-order business and\r\nfrom official postage stamps) - 27,468,323,420 -\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nRutherford B. Hayes\r\nDecember 2, 1878\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nOur heartfelt gratitude is due to the Divine Being who holds in His hands\r\nthe destinies of nations for the continued bestowal during the last year of\r\ncountless blessings upon our country.\r\n\r\nWe are at peace with all other nations. Our public credit has greatly\r\nimproved, and is perhaps now stronger than ever before. Abundant harvests\r\nhave rewarded the labors of those who till the soil, our manufacturing\r\nindustries are reviving, and it is believed that general prosperity, which\r\nhas been so long anxiously looked for, is at last within our reach.\r\n\r\nThe enjoyment of health by our people generally has, however, been\r\ninterrupted during the past season by the prevalence of a fatal pestilence\r\n(the yellow fever) in some portions of the Southern States, creating an\r\nemergency which called for prompt and extraordinary measures of relief. The\r\ndisease appeared as an epidemic at New Orleans and at other places on the\r\nLower Mississippi soon after midsummer. It was rapidly spread by fugitives\r\nfrom the infected cities and towns, and did not disappear until early in\r\nNovember. The States of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Tennessee have suffered\r\nseverely. About 100,000 cases are believed to have occurred, of which about\r\n20,000, according to intelligent estimates, proved fatal. It is impossible\r\nto estimate with any approach to accuracy the loss to the country\r\noccasioned by this epidemic It is to be reckoned by the hundred millions of\r\ndollars. The suffering and destitution that resulted excited the deepest\r\nsympathy in all parts of the Union. Physicians and nurses hastened from\r\nevery quarter to the assistance of the afflicted communities. Voluntary\r\ncontributions of money and supplies, in every needed form, were speedily\r\nand generously furnished. The Government was able to respond in some\r\nmeasure to the call for help, by providing tents, medicines, and food for\r\nthe sick and destitute, the requisite directions for the purpose being\r\ngiven in the confident expectation that this action of the Executive would\r\nreceive the sanction of Congress. About 1,800 tents, and rations of the\r\nvalue of about $25,000, were sent to cities and-towns which applied for\r\nthem, full details of which will be furnished to Congress by the proper\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\nThe fearful spread of this pestilence has awakened a very general public\r\nsentiment in favor of national sanitary administration, which shall not\r\nonly control quarantine, but have the sanitary supervision of internal\r\ncommerce in times of epidemics, and hold an advisory relation to the State\r\nand municipal health authorities, with power to deal with whatever\r\nendangers the public health, and which the municipal and State authorities\r\nare unable to regulate. The national quarantine act approved April 29,\r\n1878, which was passed too late in the last session of Congress to provide\r\nthe means for carrying it into practical operation during the past season,\r\nis a step in the direction here indicated. In view of the necessity for the\r\nmost effective measures, by quarantine and otherwise, for the protection of\r\nour seaports and the country generally from this and other epidemics, it is\r\nrecommended that Congress give to the whole subject early and careful\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nThe permanent pacification of the country by the complete protection of all\r\ncitizens in every civil and political right continues to be of paramount\r\ninterest with the great body of our people. Every step in this direction is\r\nwelcomed with public approval, and every interruption of steady and uniform\r\nprogress to the desired consummation awakens general uneasiness and\r\nwidespread condemnation. The recent Congressional elections have furnished\r\na direct and trustworthy test of the advance thus far made in the practical\r\nestablishment of the right of suffrage secured by the Constitution to the\r\nliberated race in the Southern States. All disturbing influences, real or\r\nimaginary, had been removed from all of these States.\r\n\r\nThe three constitutional amendments which conferred freedom and equality of\r\ncivil and political rights upon the colored people of the South were\r\nadopted by the concurrent action of the great body of good citizens who\r\nmaintained the authority of the National Government and the integrity and\r\nperpetuity of the Union at such a cost of treasure and life, as a wise and\r\nnecessary embodiment in the organic law of the just results of the war. The\r\npeople of the former slaveholding States accepted these results, and gave\r\nin every practicable form assurances that the thirteenth, fourteenth, and\r\nfifteenth amendments, and laws passed in pursuance thereof, should in good\r\nfaith be enforced, rigidly and impartially, in letter and spirit, to the\r\nend that the humblest citizen, without distinction of race or color, should\r\nunder them receive full and equal protection in person and property and in\r\npolitical rights and privileges. By these constitutional amendments the\r\nsouthern section of the Union obtained a large increase of political power\r\nin Congress and in the electoral college, and the country justly expected\r\nthat elections would proceed, as to the enfranchised race, upon the same\r\ncircumstances of legal and constitutional freedom and protection which\r\nobtained in all the other States of the Union. The friends of law and order\r\nlooked forward to the conduct of these elections as offering to the general\r\njudgment of the country an important opportunity to measure the degree in\r\nwhich the right of suffrage could be exercised by the colored people and\r\nwould be respected by their fellow-citizens; but a more general enjoyment\r\nof freedom of suffrage by the colored people and a more just and generous\r\nprotection of that freedom by the communities of which they form a part\r\nwere generally anticipated than the record of the elections discloses. In\r\nsome of those States in which the colored people have been unable to make\r\ntheir opinions felt in the elections the result is mainly due to influences\r\nnot easily measured or remedied by legal protection; but in the States of\r\nLouisiana and South Carolina at large, and in some particular Congressional\r\ndistricts outside of those States, the records of the elections seem to\r\ncompel the conclusion that the rights of the colored voters have been\r\noverridden and their participation in the elections not permitted to be\r\neither general or free.\r\n\r\nIt will be for the Congress for which these elections were held to make\r\nsuch examinations into their conduct as may be appropriate to determine the\r\nvalidity of the claims of members to their seats. In the meanwhile it\r\nbecomes the duty of the executive and judicial departments of the\r\nGovernment, each in its province, to inquire into and punish violations of\r\nthe laws of the United States which have occurred. I can but repeat what I\r\nsaid in this connection in my last message, that whatever authority rests\r\nwith me to this end I shall not hesitate to put forth; and I am unwilling\r\nto forego a renewed appeal to the legislatures, the courts, the executive\r\nauthorities, and the people of the States where these wrongs have been\r\nperpetrated to give their assistance toward bringing to justice the\r\noffenders and preventing a repetition of the crimes. No means within my\r\npower will be spared to obtain a full and fair investigation of the alleged\r\ncrimes and to secure the conviction and just punishment of the guilty.\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed that the principal appropriation made for the\r\nDepartment of Justice at the last session contained the following clause:\r\nAnd for defraying the expenses which may be incurred in the enforcement of\r\nthe act approved February 28, 1871, entitled \"An act to amend an act\r\napproved May 31, 1870, entitled 'An act to enforce the rights of citizens\r\nof the United States to vote in the several States of this Union, and for\r\nother purposes,'\" or any acts amendatory thereof or supplementary thereto.\r\nIt is the opinion of the Attorney-General that the expenses of these\r\nproceedings will largely exceed the amount which was thus provided, and I\r\nrely confidently upon Congress to make adequate appropriations to enable\r\nthe executive department to enforce the laws.\r\n\r\nI respectfully urge upon your attention that the Congressional elections,\r\nin every district, in a very important sense, are justly a matter of\r\npolitical interest and concern throughout the whole country. Each State,\r\nevery political party, is entitled to the share of power which is conferred\r\nby the legal and constitutional suffrage. It is the right of every citizen\r\npossessing the qualifications prescribed by law to east one unintimidated\r\nballot and to have his ballot honestly counted. So long as the exercise of\r\nthis power and the enjoyment of this right are common and equal,\r\npractically as well as formally, submission to the results of the suffrage\r\nwill be accorded loyally and cheerfully, and all the departments of\r\nGovernment will feel the true vigor of the popular will thus expressed. No\r\ntemporary or administrative interests of Government, however urgent or\r\nweighty, will ever displace the zeal of our people in defense of the\r\nprimary rights of citizenship. They understand that the protection of\r\nliberty requires the maintenance in full vigor of the manly methods of free\r\nspeech, free press, and free suffrage, and will sustain the full authority\r\nof Government to enforce the laws which are framed to preserve these\r\ninestimable rights. The material progress and welfare of the States depend\r\non the protection afforded to their citizens. There can be no peace without\r\nsuch protection, no prosperity without peace, and the whole country is\r\ndeeply interested in the growth and prosperity of all its parts.\r\n\r\nWhile the country has not yet reached complete unity of feeling and\r\nreciprocal confidence between the communities so lately and so seriously\r\nestranged, I feel an absolute assurance that the tendencies are in that\r\ndirection, and with increasing force. The power of public opinion will\r\noverride all political prejudices and all sectional or State attachments in\r\ndemanding that all over our wide territory the name and character of\r\ncitizen of the United States shall mean one and the same thing and carry\r\nwith them unchallenged security and respect.\r\n\r\nOur relations with other countries continue peaceful. Our neutrality in\r\ncontests between foreign powers has been maintained and respected.\r\n\r\nThe Universal Exposition held at Paris during the past summer has been\r\nattended by large numbers of our citizens. The brief period allowed for the\r\npreparation and arrangement of the contributions of our citizens to this\r\ngreat exposition was well employed in energetic and judicious efforts to\r\novercome this disadvantage. These efforts, led and directed by the\r\ncommissioner-general, were remarkably successful, and the exhibition of the\r\nproducts of American industry was creditable and gratifying in scope and\r\ncharacter. The reports of the United States commissioners, giving its\r\nresults in detail, will be duly laid before you. Our participation in this\r\ninternational competition for the favor and the trade of the world may be\r\nexpected to produce useful and important results--in promoting intercourse,\r\nfriendship, and commerce with other nations.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the provisions of the act of February 28, 1878, three\r\ncommissioners were appointed to an international conference on the subject\r\nof adopting a common ratio between gold and silver, for the purpose of\r\nestablishing internationally the use of bimetallic money and securing\r\nfixity of relative value between those metals.\r\n\r\nInvitations were addressed to the various governments which had expressed a\r\nwillingness to participate in its deliberations. The conference held its\r\nmeetings in Paris in August last. The report of the commissioners, herewith\r\nsubmitted, will show its results. No common ratio between gold and silver\r\ncould be agreed upon by the conference. The general conclusion was reached\r\nthat it is necessary to maintain in the world the monetary functions of\r\nsilver as well as of gold, leaving the selection of the use of one or the\r\nother of these two metals, or of both, to be made by each state.\r\n\r\nCongress having appropriated at its last session the sum of $5,500,000 to\r\npay the award of the joint commission at Halifax, if, after correspondence\r\nwith the British Government on the subject of the conformity of the award\r\nto the requirements of the treaty and to the terms of the question thereby\r\nsubmitted to the commission, the President shall deem it his duty to make\r\nthe payment, communications upon these points were addressed to the British\r\nGovernment through the legation of the United States at London. Failing to\r\nobtain the concurrence of the British Government in the views of this\r\nGovernment respecting the award, I have deemed it my duty to tender the sum\r\nnamed within the year fixed by the treaty, accompanied by a notice of the\r\ngrounds of the payment and a protest against any other construction of the\r\nsame. The correspondence upon this subject will be laid before you.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish Government has officially announced the termination of the\r\ninsurrection in Cuba and the restoration of peace throughout that island.\r\nConfident expectations are expressed of a revival of trade and prosperity,\r\nwhich it is earnestly hoped may prove well rounded. Numerous claims of\r\nAmerican citizens for relief for injuries or restoration of property have\r\nbeen among the incidents of the long-continued hostilities. Some of these\r\nclaims are in process of adjustment by Spain, and the others are promised\r\nearly and careful consideration.\r\n\r\nThe treaty made with Italy in regard to reciprocal consular privileges has\r\nbeen duly ratified and proclaimed.\r\n\r\nNo questions of grave importance have arisen with any other of the European\r\npowers.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese Government has been desirous of a revision of such parts of\r\nits treaties with foreign powers as relate to commerce, and it is\r\nunderstood has addressed to each of the treaty powers a request to open\r\nnegotiations with that view. The United States Government has been inclined\r\nto regard the matter favorably. Whatever restrictions upon trade with Japan\r\nare found injurious to that people can not but affect injuriously nations\r\nholding commercial intercourse with them. Japan, after a long period of\r\nseclusion, has within the past few years made rapid strides in the path of\r\nenlightenment and progress, and, not unreasonably, is looking forward to\r\nthe time when her relations with the nations of Europe and America shall be\r\nassimilated to those which they hold with each other. A treaty looking to\r\nthis end has been made, which will be submitted for the consideration of\r\nthe Senate.\r\n\r\nAfter an interval of several years the Chinese Government has again sent\r\nenvoys to the United States. They have been received, and a permanent\r\nlegation is now established here by that Government. It is not doubted that\r\nthis step will be of advantage to both nations in promoting friendly\r\nrelations and removing causes of difference.\r\n\r\nThe treaty with the Samoan Islands, having been duly ratified and accepted\r\non the part of both Governments, is now in operation, and a survey and\r\nsoundings of the harbor of Pago-Pago have been made by a naval vessel of\r\nthe United States, with a view of its occupation as a naval station if\r\nfound desirable to the service.\r\n\r\nSince the resumption of diplomatic relations with Mexico correspondence has\r\nbeen opened and still continues between the two Governments upon the\r\nvarious questions which at one time seemed to endanger their relations.\r\nWhile no formal agreement has been reached as to the troubles on the\r\nborder, much has been done to repress and diminish them. The effective\r\nforce of United States troops on the Rio Grande, by a strict and faithful\r\ncompliance with instructions, has done much to remove the sources of\r\ndispute, and it is now understood that a like force of Mexican troops on\r\nthe other side of the river is also making an energetic movement against\r\nthe marauding Indian tribes. This Government looks with the greatest\r\nsatisfaction upon every evidence of strength in the national authority of\r\nMexico, and upon every effort put forth to prevent or to punish incursions\r\nupon our territory. Reluctant to assume any action or attitude in the\r\ncontrol of these incursions by military movements across the border not\r\nimperatively demanded for the protection of the lives and property of our\r\nown citizens, I shall take the earliest opportunity consistent with the\r\nproper discharge of this plain duty to recognize the ability of the Mexican\r\nGovernment to restrain effectively violations of our territory. It is\r\nproposed to hold next year an international exhibition in Mexico, and it is\r\nbelieved that the display of the agricultural and manufacturing products of\r\nthe two nations will tend to better understanding and increased commercial\r\nintercourse between their people.\r\n\r\nWith Brazil and the Republics of Central and South America some steps have\r\nbeen taken toward the development of closer commercial intercourse.\r\nDiplomatic relations have been resumed with Colombia and with Bolivia. A\r\nboundary question between the Argentine Republic and Paraguay has been\r\nsubmitted by those Governments for arbitration to the President of the\r\nUnited States, and I have, after careful examination, given a decision upon\r\nit.\r\n\r\nA naval expedition up the Amazon and Madeira rivers has brought back\r\ninformation valuable both for scientific and commercial purposes. A like\r\nexpedition is about visiting the coast of Africa and the Indian Ocean. The\r\nreports of diplomatic and consular officers in relation to the development\r\nof our foreign commerce have furnished many facts that have proved of\r\npublic interest and have stimulated to practical exertion the enterprise of\r\nour people.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Treasury furnishes a detailed statement\r\nof the operations of that Department of the Government and of the condition\r\nof the public finances.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary revenues from all sources for the fiscal year ended June 30,\r\n1878, were $257,763,878.70; the ordinary expenditures for the same period\r\nwere $236,964,326.80, leaving a surplus revenue for the year of\r\n$20,799,551.90. The receipts for the present fiscal year, ending June 30,\r\n1879, actual and estimated, are as follows: Actual receipts for the first\r\nquarter, commencing July 1, 1878, $73,389,743.43; estimated receipts for\r\nthe remaining three quarters of the year, $191,110,256.57; total receipts\r\nfor the current fiscal year, actual and estimated, $264,500,000. The\r\nexpenditures for the same period will be, actual and estimated, as follows:\r\nFor the quarter commencing July 1, 1878, actual expenditures,\r\n$73,344,573.27; and for the remaining three quarters of the year the\r\nexpenditures are estimated at $166,755,426.73, making the total\r\nexpenditures $240,100,000, and leaving an estimated surplus revenue for the\r\nyear ending June 30, 1879, of $24,400,000. The total receipts during the\r\nnext fiscal year, ending June 30, 1880, estimated according to existing\r\nlaws, will be $264,500,000, and the estimated ordinary expenditures for the\r\nsame period will be $236,320,412.68, leaving a surplus of $28,179,587.32\r\nfor that year.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing statements of expenditures, actual and estimated, no\r\namount is allowed for the sinking fund provided for by the act approved\r\nFebruary 25, 1862, which requires that 1 per cent of the entire debt of the\r\nUnited States shall be purchased or paid within each fiscal year, to be set\r\napart as a sinking fund. There has been, however, a substantial compliance\r\nwith the conditions of the law. By its terms the public debt should have\r\nbeen reduced between 1862 and the close of the last fiscal year\r\n$518,361,806.28; the actual reduction of the ascertained debt in that\r\nperiod has been $720,644,739.61, being in excess of the reduction required\r\nby the sinking fund act $202,282,933.33.\r\n\r\nThe amount of the public debt, less cash in the Treasury, November 1, 1878,\r\nwas $2,024,200,083.18 a reduction since the same date last year of\r\n$23,150,617.39.\r\n\r\nThe progress made during the last year in refunding the public debt at\r\nlower rates of interest is very gratifying. The amount of 4 per cent bonds\r\nsold during the present year prior to November 23, 1878, is $100,270,900,\r\nand 6 per cent bonds, commonly known as five-twenties, to an equal amount,\r\nhave been or will be redeemed as calls mature.\r\n\r\nIt has been the policy of the Department to place the 4 per cent bonds\r\nwithin easy reach of every citizen who desires to invest his savings,\r\nwhether small or great, in these securities. The Secretary of the Treasury\r\nrecommends that the law be so modified that small sums may be invested, and\r\nthat through the post-offices or other agents of the Government the freest\r\nopportunity may be given in all parts of the country for such investments.\r\n\r\nThe best mode suggested is that the Department be authorized to issue\r\ncertificates of deposit, of the denomination of $10, bearing interest at\r\nthe rate of 3.65 per cent per annum and convertible at any time within one\r\nyear after their issue into the 4 per cent bonds authorized by the\r\nrefunding act, and to be issued only in exchange for United States notes\r\nsent to the Treasury by mail or otherwise. Such a provision of law,\r\nsupported by suitable regulations, would enable any person readily, without\r\ncost or risk, to convert his money into an interest-bearing security of the\r\nUnited States, and the money so received could be applied to the redemption\r\nof 6 per cent bonds.\r\n\r\nThe coinage of gold during the last fiscal year was $52,798,980. The\r\ncoinage of silver dollars under the act passed February 28, 1878, amounted\r\non the 23d of November, 1878, to $19,814,550, of which amount $4,984,947\r\nare in circulation, and the balance, $14,829,603, is still in the\r\npossession of the Government.\r\n\r\nWith views unchanged with regard to the act under which the coinage of\r\nsilver proceeds, it has been the purpose of the Secretary faithfully to\r\nexecute the law and to afford a fair trial to the measure.\r\n\r\nIn the present financial condition of the country I am persuaded that the\r\nwelfare of legitimate business and industry of every description will be\r\nbest promoted by abstaining from all attempts to make radical changes in\r\nthe existing financial legislation. Let it be understood that during the\r\ncoming year the business of the country will be undisturbed by governmental\r\ninterference with the laws affecting it, and we may confidently expect that\r\nthe resumption of specie payments, which will take place at the appointed\r\ntime, will be successfully and easily maintained, and that it will be\r\nfollowed by a healthful and enduring revival of business prosperity.\r\n\r\nLet the healing influence of time, the inherent energies of our people, and\r\nthe boundless resources of our country have a fair opportunity, and relief\r\nfrom present difficulties will surely follow.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of War shows that the Army has been well and\r\neconomically supplied; that our small force has been actively employed and\r\nhas faithfully performed all the service required of it. The morale of the\r\nArmy has improved and the number of desertions has materially decreased\r\nduring the year.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary recommends--\r\n\r\n1. That a pension be granted to the widow of the late Lieutenant Henry H.\r\nBenner, Eighteenth Infantry, who lost his life by yellow fever while in\r\ncommand of the steamer. J.M. Chambers, sent with supplies for the relief of\r\nsufferers in the South from that disease.\r\n\r\n2. The establishment of the annuity scheme for the benefit of the heirs of\r\ndeceased officers, as suggested by the Paymaster-General.\r\n\r\n3. The adoption by Congress of a plan for the publication of the records of\r\nthe War of the Rebellion, now being prepared for that purpose.\r\n\r\n4. The increase of the extra per diem of soldier teachers employed in post\r\nschools, and liberal appropriations for the erection of buildings for\r\nschools and libraries at the different posts.\r\n\r\n5. The repeal or amendment of the act of June 18, 1878, forbidding the use\r\nof the Army \"as a posse comitatus, or otherwise, for the purpose of\r\nexecuting the laws, except in such cases and under such circumstances as\r\nsuch employment of said force may be expressly authorized by the\r\nConstitution or by act of Congress.\"\r\n\r\n6. The passage of a joint resolution of Congress legalizing the issues of\r\nrations, tents, and medicines which were made for the relief of sufferers\r\nfrom yellow fever.\r\n\r\n7. That provision be made for the erection of a fireproof building for the\r\npreservation of certain valuable records, now constantly exposed to\r\ndestruction by fire.\r\n\r\nThese recommendations are all commended to your favorable consideration.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Navy shows that the Navy has improved\r\nduring the last fiscal year. Work has been done on seventy-five vessels,\r\nten of which have been thoroughly repaired and made ready for sea. Two\r\nothers are in rapid progress toward completion. The total expenditures of\r\nthe year, including the amount appropriated for the deficiencies of the\r\nprevious year, were $17,468,392.65. The actual expenses chargeable to the\r\nyear, exclusive of these deficiencies, were $13,306,914.09, or $767,199.18\r\nless than those of the previous year, and $4,928,677.74 less than the\r\nexpenses including the deficiencies. The estimates for the fiscal year\r\nending June 30, 1880, are $14,562,381.45, exceeding the appropriations of\r\nthe present year only $33,949.75, which excess is occasioned by the demands\r\nof the Naval Academy and the Marine Corps, as explained in the Secretary's\r\nreport. The appropriations for the present fiscal year are $14,528,431.70,\r\nwhich, in the opinion of the Secretary, will be ample for all the current\r\nexpenses of the Department during the year. The amount drawn from the\r\nTreasury from July 1 to November 1, 1878, is $4,740,544.14, of which\r\n$70,980.75 has been refunded, leaving as the expenditure for that period\r\n$4,669,563.39, or $520,899.24 less than the corresponding period of the\r\nlast fiscal year.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster-General embraces a detailed statement of the\r\noperations of the Post-Office Department. The expenditures of that\r\nDepartment for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1878, were $34,165,084.49.\r\nThe receipts, including sales of stamps, money-order business, and official\r\nstamps, were $29,277,516.95. The sum of $290,436.90, included in the\r\nforegoing statement of expenditures, is chargeable to preceding years, so\r\nthat the actual expenditures for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1878, are\r\n$33,874,647.59. The amount drawn from the Treasury on appropriations, in\r\naddition to the revenues of the Department, was $5,307,652.82. The\r\nexpenditures for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1880, are estimated at\r\n$36,571,900 and the receipts from all sources at $30,664,023.90, leaving a\r\ndeficiency to be appropriated out of the Treasury of $5,907,876.10. The\r\nreport calls attention to the fact that the compensation of postmasters and\r\nof railroads for carrying the mail is regulated by law, and that the\r\nfailure of Congress to appropriate the amounts required for these purposes\r\ndoes not relieve the Government of responsibility, but necessarily\r\nincreases the deficiency bills which Congress will be called upon to pass.\r\n\r\nIn providing for the postal service the following questions are presented:\r\nShould Congress annually appropriate a sum for its expenses largely in\r\nexcess of its revenues, or should such rates of postage be established as\r\nwill make the Department self-sustaining? Should the postal service be\r\nreduced by excluding from the mails matter which does not pay its way?\r\nShould the number of post routes be diminished? Should other methods be\r\nadopted which will increase the revenues or diminish the expenses of the\r\npostal service?\r\n\r\nThe International Postal Congress which met at Paris May 1, 1878, and\r\ncontinued in session until June 4 of the same year, was composed of\r\ndelegates from nearly all the civilized countries of the world. It adopted\r\na new convention (to take the place of the treaty concluded at Berne\r\nOctober 9, 1874), which goes into effect on the 1st of April, 1879, between\r\nthe countries whose delegates have signed it. It was ratified and approved,\r\nby and with the consent of the President, August 13, 1878. A synopsis of\r\nthis Universal Postal Convention will be found in the report of the\r\nPostmaster-General, and the full text in the appendix thereto. In its\r\norigin the Postal Union comprised twenty-three countries, having a\r\npopulation of 350,000,000 people. On the 1st of April next it will comprise\r\nforty-three countries and colonies, with a population of more than\r\n650,000,000 people, and will soon, by the accession of the few remaining\r\ncountries and colonies which maintain organized postal services, constitute\r\nin fact as well as in name, as its new title indicates, a universal union,\r\nregulating, upon a uniform basis of cheap postage rates, the postal\r\nintercourse between all civilized nations.\r\n\r\nSome embarrassment has arisen out of the conflict between the customs laws\r\nof this country and the provisions of the Postal Convention in regard to\r\nthe transmission of foreign books and newspapers to this country by mail.\r\nIt is hoped that Congress will be able to devise some means of reconciling\r\nthe difficulties which have thus been created, so as to do justice to all\r\nparties involved.\r\n\r\nThe business of the Supreme Court and of the courts in many of the circuits\r\nhas increased to such an extent during the past year that additional\r\nlegislation is imperative to relieve and prevent the delay of justice and\r\npossible oppression to suitors which is thus occasioned. The encumbered\r\ncondition of these dockets is presented anew in the report of the\r\nAttorney-General, and the remedy suggested is earnestly urged for\r\nCongressional action. The creation of additional circuit judges, as\r\nproposed, would afford a complete remedy, and would involve an expense, at\r\nthe present rate of salaries of not more than $60,000 a year.\r\n\r\nThe annual reports of the Secretary of the Interior and of the Commissioner\r\nof Indian Affairs present an elaborate account of the present condition of\r\nthe Indian tribes and of that branch of the public service which ministers\r\nto their interests. While the conduct of the Indians generally has been\r\norderly and their relations with their neighbors friendly and peaceable,\r\ntwo local disturbances have occurred, which were deplorable in their\r\ncharacter, but remained, happily, confined to a comparatively small number\r\nof Indians. The discontent among the Bannocks, which led first to some acts\r\nof violence on the part of some members of the tribe and finally to the\r\noutbreak, appears to have been caused by an insufficiency of food on the\r\nreservation, and this insufficiency to have been owing to the inadequacy of\r\nthe appropriations made by Congress to the wants of the Indians at a time\r\nwhen the Indians were prevented from supplying the deficiency by hunting.\r\nAfter an arduous pursuit by the troops of the United States, and several\r\nengagements, the hostile Indians were reduced to subjection, and the larger\r\npart of them surrendered themselves as prisoners. In this connection I\r\ndesire to call attention to the recommendation made by the Secretary of the\r\nInterior, that a sufficient fund be placed at the disposal of the\r\nExecutive, to be used, with proper accountability, at discretion, in sudden\r\nemergencies of the Indian service.\r\n\r\nThe other case of disturbance was that of a band of Northern Cheyennes, who\r\nsuddenly left their reservation in the Indian Territory and marched rapidly\r\nthrough the States of Kansas and Nebraska in the direction of their old\r\nhunting grounds, committing murders and other crimes on their way. From\r\ndocuments accompanying the report of the Secretary of the Interior it\r\nappears that this disorderly band was as fully supplied with the\r\nnecessaries of life as the 4,700 other Indians who remained quietly on the\r\nreservation, and that the disturbance was caused by men of a restless and\r\nmischievous disposition among the Indians themselves. Almost the whole of\r\nthis band have surrendered to the military authorities; and it is a\r\ngratifying fact that when some of them had taken refuge in the camp of the\r\nRed Cloud Sioux, with whom they had been in friendly relations, the Sioux\r\nheld them as prisoners and readily gave them up to the officers of the\r\nUnited States, thus giving new proof of the loyal spirit which, alarming\r\nrumors to the contrary notwithstanding, they have uniformly shown ever\r\nsince the wishes they expressed at the council of September, 1877, had been\r\ncomplied with.\r\n\r\nBoth the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of War unite in the\r\nrecommendation that provision be made by Congress for the organization of a\r\ncorps of mounted \"Indian auxiliaries,\" to be under the control of the Army\r\nand to be used for the purpose of keeping the Indians on their reservations\r\nand preventing or repressing disturbance on their part. I earnestly concur\r\nin this recommendation. It is believed that the organization of such a body\r\nof Indian cavalry, receiving a moderate pay from the Government, would\r\nconsiderably weaken the restless element among the Indians by withdrawing\r\nfrom it a number of young men and giving them congenial employment under\r\nthe Government, it being a matter of experience that Indians in our service\r\nalmost without exception are faithful in the performance of the duties\r\nassigned to them. Such an organization would materially aid the Army in the\r\naccomplishment of a task for which its numerical strength is sometimes\r\nfound insufficient.\r\n\r\nBut while the employment of force for the prevention or repression of\r\nIndian troubles is of occasional necessity, and wise preparation should be\r\nmade to that end, greater reliance must be placed on humane and civilizing\r\nagencies for the ultimate solution of what is called the Indian problem. It\r\nmay be very difficult and require much patient effort to curb the unruly\r\nspirit of the savage Indian to the restraints of civilized life, but\r\nexperience shows that it is not impossible. Many of the tribes which are\r\nnow quiet and orderly and self-supporting were once as savage as any that\r\nat present roam over the plains or in the mountains of the far West, and\r\nwere then considered inaccessible to civilizing influences. It may be\r\nimpossible to raise them fully up to the level of the white population of\r\nthe United States; but we should not forget that they are the aborigines of\r\nthe country, and called the soil their own on which our people have grown\r\nrich, powerful, and happy. We owe it to them as a moral duty to help them\r\nin attaining at least that degree of civilization which they may be able to\r\nreach. It is not only our duty, it is also our interest to do so. Indians\r\nwho have become agriculturists or herdsmen, and feel an interest in\r\nproperty, will thenceforth cease to be a warlike and disturbing element. It\r\nis also a well-authenticated fact that Indians are apt to be peaceable and\r\nquiet when their children are at school, and I am gratified to know, from\r\nthe expressions of Indians themselves and from many concurring reports,\r\nthat there is a steadily increasing desire, even among Indians belonging to\r\ncomparatively wild tribes, to have their children educated. I invite\r\nattention to the reports of the Secretary of the Interior and the\r\nCommissioner of Indian Affairs touching the experiment recently\r\ninaugurated, in taking fifty Indian children, boys and girls, from\r\ndifferent tribes, to the Hampton Normal Agricultural Institute in Virginia,\r\nwhere they are to receive an elementary English education and training in\r\nagriculture and other useful works, to be returned to their tribes, after\r\nthe completed course, as interpreters, instructors, and examples. It is\r\nreported that the officer charged with the selection of those children\r\nmight have had thousands of young Indians sent with him had it been\r\npossible to make provision for them. I agree with the Secretary of the\r\nInterior in saying that \"the result of this interesting experiment, if\r\nfavorable, may be destined to become an important factor in the advancement\r\nof civilization among the Indians.\"\r\n\r\nThe question whether a change in the control of the Indian service should\r\nbe made was at the last session of Congress referred to a committee for\r\ninquiry and report. Without desiring to anticipate that report, I venture\r\nto express the hope that in the decision of so important a question the\r\nviews expressed above may not be lost sight of, and that the decision,\r\nwhatever it may be, will arrest further agitation of this subject, such\r\nagitation being apt to produce a disturbing effect upon the service, as\r\nwell as on the Indians themselves.\r\n\r\nIn the enrollment of the bill making appropriations for sundry civil\r\nexpenses, at the last session of Congress, that portion which provided for\r\nthe continuation of the Hot Springs Commission was omitted. As the\r\ncommission had completed the work of taking testimony on the many\r\nconflicting claims, the suspension of their labors, before determining the\r\nrights of claimants, threatened for a time to embarrass the interests, not\r\nonly of the Government, but also of a large number of the citizens of Hot\r\nSprings, who were waiting for final action on their claims before beginning\r\ncontemplated improvements. In order to prevent serious difficulties, which\r\nwere apprehended, and at the solicitation of many leading citizens of Hot\r\nSprings and others interested in the welfare of the town, the Secretary of\r\nthe Interior was authorized to request the late commissioners to take\r\ncharge of the records of their proceedings and to perform such work as\r\ncould properly be done by them under such circumstances to facilitate the\r\nfuture adjudication of the claims at an early day and to preserve the\r\nstatus of the claimants until their rights should be finally determined.\r\nThe late commissioners complied with that request, and report that the\r\ntestimony in all the cases has been written out, examined, briefed, and so\r\narranged as to facilitate an early settlement when authorized by law. It is\r\nrecommended that the requisite authority be given at as early a day in the\r\nsession as possible, and that a fair compensation be allowed the late\r\ncommissioners for the expense incurred and the labor performed by them\r\nsince the 25th of June last.\r\n\r\nI invite the attention of Congress to the recommendations made by the\r\nSecretary of the Interior with regard to the preservation of the timber on\r\nthe public lands of the United States. The protection of the public\r\nproperty is one of the first duties of the Government. The Department of\r\nthe Interior should therefore be enabled by sufficient appropriations to\r\nenforce the laws in that respect. But this matter appears still more\r\nimportant as a question of public economy. The rapid destruction of our\r\nforests is an evil fraught with the gravest consequences, especially in the\r\nmountainous districts, where the rocky slopes, once denuded of their trees,\r\nwill remain so forever. There the injury, once done, can not be repaired. I\r\nfully concur with the Secretary of the Interior in the opinion that for\r\nthis reason legislation touching the public timber in the mountainous\r\nStates and Territories of the West should be especially well considered,\r\nand that existing laws in which the destruction of the forests is not\r\nsufficiently guarded against should be speedily modified. A general law\r\nconcerning this important subject appears to me to be a matter of urgent\r\npublic necessity.\r\n\r\nFrom the organization of the Government the importance of encouraging by\r\nall possible means the increase of our agricultural productions has been\r\nacknowledged and urged upon the attention of Congress and the people as the\r\nsurest and readiest means of increasing our substantial and enduring\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\nThe words of Washington are as applicable to-day as when, in his eighth\r\nannual message, he said: It will not be doubted that, with reference either\r\nto individual or national welfare, agriculture is of primary importance. In\r\nproportion as nations advance in population and other circumstances of\r\nmaturity this truth becomes more apparent, and renders the cultivation of\r\nthe soil more and more an object of public patronage. Institutions for\r\npromoting it grow up, supported by the public purse; and to what object can\r\nit be dedicated with greater propriety? Among the means which have been\r\nemployed to this end none have been attended with greater success than the\r\nestablishment of boards (composed of proper characters) charged with\r\ncollecting and diffusing information, and enabled by premiums and small\r\npecuniary aids to encourage and assist a spirit of discovery and\r\nimprovement. This species of establishment contributes doubly to the\r\nincrease of improvement, by stimulating to enterprise and experiment, and\r\nby drawing to a common center the results everywhere of individual skill\r\nand observation and spreading them thence over the whole nation. Experience\r\naccordingly hath shewn that they are very cheap instruments of immense\r\nnational benefits. The preponderance of the agricultural over any other\r\ninterest in the United States entitles it to all the consideration claimed\r\nfor it by Washington. About one-half of the population of the United States\r\nis engaged in agriculture. The value of the agricultural products of the\r\nUnited States for the year 1878 is estimated at $3,000,000,000. The exports\r\nof agricultural products for the year 1877, as appears from the report of\r\nthe Bureau of Statistics, were $524,000,000. The great extent of our\r\ncountry, with its diversity of soil and climate, enables us to produce\r\nwithin our own borders and by our own labor not only the necessaries, but\r\nmost of the luxuries, that are consumed in civilized countries. Yet,\r\nnotwithstanding our advantages of soil, climate, and inter-communication,\r\nit appears from the statistical statements in the report of the\r\nCommissioner of Agriculture that we import annually from foreign lands many\r\nmillions of dollars worth of agricultural products which could be raised in\r\nour own country.\r\n\r\nNumerous questions arise in the practice of advanced agriculture which can\r\nonly be answered by experiments, often costly and sometimes fruitless,\r\nwhich are beyond the means of private individuals and are a just and proper\r\ncharge on the whole nation for the benefit of the nation. It is good\r\npolicy, especially in times of depression and uncertainty in other business\r\npursuits, with a vast area of uncultivated, and hence unproductive,\r\nterritory, wisely opened to homestead settlement, to encourage by every\r\nproper and legitimate means the occupation and tillage of the soil. The\r\nefforts of the Department of Agriculture to stimulate old and introduce new\r\nagricultural industries, to improve the quality and increase the quantity\r\nof our products, to determine the value of old or establish the importance\r\nof new methods of culture, are worthy of your careful and favorable\r\nconsideration, and assistance by such appropriations of money and\r\nenlargement of facilities as may seem to be demanded by the present\r\nfavorable conditions for the growth and rapid development of this important\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nThe abuse of animals in transit is widely attracting public attention. A\r\nnational convention of societies specially interested in the subject has\r\nrecently met at Baltimore, and the facts developed, both in regard to\r\ncruelties to animals and the effect of such cruelties upon the public\r\nhealth, would seem to demand the careful consideration of Congress and the\r\nenactment of more efficient laws for the prevention of these abuses.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Commissioner of the Bureau of Education shows very\r\ngratifying progress throughout the country in all the interests committed\r\nto the care of this important office. The report is especially encouraging\r\nwith respect to the extension of the advantages of the common-school system\r\nin sections of the country where the general enjoyment of the privilege of\r\nfree schools is not yet attained.\r\n\r\nTo education more than to any other agency we are to look as the resource\r\nfor the advancement of the people in the requisite knowledge and\r\nappreciation of their rights and responsibilities as citizens, and I desire\r\nto repeat the suggestion contained in my former message in behalf of the\r\nenactment of appropriate measures by Congress for the purpose of\r\nsupplementing with national aid the local systems of education in the\r\nseveral States.\r\n\r\nAdequate accommodations for the great library, which is overgrowing the\r\ncapacity of the rooms now occupied at the Capitol, should be provided\r\nwithout further delay. This invaluable collection of books, manuscripts,\r\nand illustrative art has grown to such proportions, in connection with the\r\ncopyright system of the country, as to demand the prompt and careful\r\nattention of Congress to save it from injury in its present crowded and\r\ninsufficient quarters. As this library is national in its character, and\r\nmust from the nature of the case increase even more rapidly in the future\r\nthan in the past, it can not be doubted that the people will sanction any\r\nwise expenditure to preserve it and to enlarge its usefulness.\r\n\r\nThe appeal of the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution for the means to\r\norganize, exhibit, and make available for the public benefit the articles\r\nnow stored away belonging to the National Museum I heartily recommend to\r\nyour favorable consideration.\r\n\r\nThe attention of Congress is again invited to the condition of the river\r\nfront of the city of Washington. It is a matter of vital importance to the\r\nhealth of the residents of the national capital, both temporary and\r\npermanent, that the lowlands in front of the city, now subject to tidal\r\noverflow, should be reclaimed. In their present condition these flats\r\nobstruct the drainage of the city and are a dangerous source of malarial\r\npoison. The reclamation will improve the navigation of the river by\r\nrestricting, and consequently deepening, its channel, and is also of\r\nimportance when considered in connection with the extension of the public\r\nground and the enlargement of the park west and south of the Washington\r\nMonument. The report of the board of survey, heretofore ordered by act of\r\nCongress, on the improvement of the harbor of Washington and Georgetown, is\r\nrespectfully commended to consideration.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Commissioners of the District of Columbia presents a\r\ndetailed statement of the affairs of the District.\r\n\r\nThe relative expenditures by the United States and the District for local\r\npurposes is contrasted, showing that the expenditures by the people of the\r\nDistrict greatly exceed those of the General Government. The exhibit is\r\nmade in connection with estimates for the requisite repair of the defective\r\npavements and sewers of the city, which is a work of immediate necessity;\r\nand in the same connection a plan is presented for the permanent funding of\r\nthe outstanding securities of the District.\r\n\r\nThe benevolent, reformatory, and penal institutions of the District are all\r\nentitled to the favorable attention of Congress. The Reform School needs\r\nadditional buildings and teachers. Appropriations which will place all of\r\nthese institutions in a condition to become models of usefulness and\r\nbeneficence will be regarded by the country as liberality wisely bestowed.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners, with evident justice, request attention to the\r\ndiscrimination made by Congress against the District in the donation of\r\nland for the support of the public schools, and ask that the same\r\nliberality that has been shown to the inhabitants of the various States and\r\nTerritories of the United States may be extended to the District of\r\nColumbia.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners also invite attention to the damage inflicted upon public\r\nand private interests by the present location of the depots and switching\r\ntracks of the several railroads entering the city, and ask for legislation\r\nlooking to their removal. The recommendations and suggestions contained in\r\nthe report will, I trust, receive the careful consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nSufficient time has, perhaps, not elapsed since the reorganization of the\r\ngovernment of the District under the recent legislation of Congress for the\r\nexpression of a confident opinion as to its successful operation, but the\r\npractical results already attained are so satisfactory that the friends of\r\nthe new government may well urge upon Congress the wisdom of its\r\ncontinuance, without essential modification, until by actual experience its\r\nadvantages and defects may be more fully ascertained.\r\n\r\nR. B. HAYES\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nRutherford B. Hayes\r\nDecember 1, 1879\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nThe members of the Forty-sixth Congress have assembled in their first\r\nregular session under circumstances calling for mutual congratulation and\r\ngrateful acknowledgment to the Giver of All Good for the large and unusual\r\nmeasure of national prosperity which we now enjoy.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting events which have occurred in our public affairs since\r\nmy last annual message to Congress are connected with the financial\r\noperations of the Government, directly affecting the business interests of\r\nthe country. I congratulate Congress on the successful execution of the\r\nresumption act. At the time fixed, and in the manner contemplated by law,\r\nUnited States notes began to be redeemed in coin. Since the 1st of January\r\nlast they have been promptly redeemed on presentation, and in all business\r\ntransactions, public and private, in all parts of the country, they are\r\nreceived and paid out as the equivalent of coin. The demand upon the\r\nTreasury for gold and silver in exchange for United States notes has been\r\ncomparatively small, and the voluntary deposit of coin and bullion in\r\nexchange for notes has been very large. The excess of the precious metals\r\ndeposited or exchanged for United States notes over the amount of United\r\nStates notes redeemed is about $40,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe resumption of specie payments has been followed by a very great revival\r\nof business. With a currency equivalent in value to the money of the\r\ncommercial world, we are enabled to enter upon an equal competition with\r\nother nations in trade and production. The increasing foreign demand for\r\nour manufactures and agricultural products has caused a large balance of\r\ntrade in our favor, which has been paid in gold, from the 1st of July last\r\nto November 15, to the amount of about $59,000,000. Since the resumption of\r\nspecie payments there has also been a marked and gratifying improvement of\r\nthe public credit. The bonds of the Government bearing only 4 per cent\r\ninterest have been sold at or above par, sufficient in amount to pay off\r\nall of the national debt which was redeemable under present laws. The\r\namount of interest saved annually by the process of refunding the debt\r\nsince March 1, 1877, is $14,297,177. The bonds sold were largely in small\r\nsums, and the number of our citizens now holding the public securities is\r\nmuch greater than ever before. The amount of the national debt which\r\nmatures within less than two years is $792,121,700, of which $500,000,000\r\nbear interest at the rate of 5 per cent, and the balance is in bonds\r\nbearing 6 per cent interest. It is believed that this part of the public\r\ndebt can be refunded by the issue of 4 per cent bonds, and, by the\r\nreduction of interest which will thus be effected, about $11,000,000 can be\r\nannually saved to the Treasury. To secure this important reduction of\r\ninterest to be paid by the United States further legislation is required,\r\nwhich it is hoped will be provided by Congress during its present session.\r\n\r\nThe coinage of gold by the mints of the United States during the last\r\nfiscal year was $40,986,912. The coinage of silver dollars since the\r\npassage of the act for that purpose up to November 1, 1879, was\r\n$45,000,850, of which $12,700,344 have been issued from the Treasury and\r\nare now in circulation, and $32,300,506 are still in the possession of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nThe pendency of the proposition for unity of action between the United\r\nStates and the principal commercial nations of Europe to effect a permanent\r\nsystem for the equality of gold and silver in the recognized money of the\r\nworld leads me to recommend that Congress refrain from new legislation on\r\nthe general subject. The great revival of trade, internal and foreign, will\r\nsupply during the coming year its own instructions, which may well be\r\nawaited before attempting further experimental measures with the coinage. I\r\nwould, however, strongly urge upon Congress the importance of authorizing\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury to suspend the coinage of silver dollars upon\r\nthe present legal ratio. The market value of the silver dollar being\r\nuniformly and largely less than the market value of the gold dollar, it is\r\nobviously impracticable to maintain them at par with each other if both are\r\ncoined without limit. If the cheaper coin is forced into circulation, it\r\nwill, if coined without limit, soon become the sole standard of value, and\r\nthus defeat the desired object, which is a currency of both gold and silver\r\nwhich shall be of equivalent value, dollar for dollar, with the universally\r\nrecognized money of the world.\r\n\r\nThe retirement from circulation of United States notes with the capacity of\r\nlegal tender in private contracts is a step to be taken in our progress\r\ntoward a safe and stable currency which should be accepted as the policy\r\nand duty of the Government and the interest and security of the people. It\r\nis my firm conviction that the issue of legal-tender paper money based\r\nwholly upon the authority and credit of the Government, except in extreme\r\nemergency, is without warrant in the Constitution and a violation of sound\r\nfinancial principles. The issue of United States notes during the late\r\ncivil war with the capacity of legal tender between private individuals was\r\nnot authorized except as a means of rescuing the country from imminent\r\nperil. The circulation of these notes as paper money for any protracted\r\nperiod of time after the accomplishment of this purpose was not\r\ncontemplated by the framers of the law under which they were issued. They\r\nanticipated the redemption and withdrawal of these notes at the earliest\r\npracticable period consistent with the attainment of the object for which\r\nthey were provided.\r\n\r\nThe policy of the United States, steadily adhered to from the adoption of\r\nthe Constitution, has been to avoid the creation of a national debt; and\r\nwhen, from necessity in time of war, debts have been created, they have\r\nbeen paid off, on the return of peace, as rapidly as possible. With this\r\nview, and for this purpose, it is recommended that the existing laws for\r\nthe accumulation of a sinking fund sufficient to extinguish the public debt\r\nwithin a limited period be maintained. If any change of the objects or\r\nrates of taxation is deemed necessary by Congress, it is suggested that\r\nexperience has shown that a duty can be placed on tea and coffee which will\r\nnot enhance the price of those articles to the consumer, and which will add\r\nseveral millions of dollars annually to the Treasury.\r\n\r\nThe continued deliberate violation by a large number of the prominent and\r\ninfluential citizens of the Territory of Utah of the laws of the United\r\nStates for the prosecution and punishment of polygamy demands the attention\r\nof every department of the Government. This Territory has a population\r\nsufficient to entitle it to admission as a State, and the general interests\r\nof the nation, as well as the welfare of the citizens of the Territory,\r\nrequire its advance from the Territorial form of government to the\r\nresponsibilities and privileges of a State. This important change will not,\r\nhowever, be approved by the country while the citizens of Utah in very\r\nconsiderable number uphold a practice which is condemned as a crime by the\r\nlaws of all civilized communities throughout the world.\r\n\r\nThe law for the suppression of this offense was enacted with great\r\nunanimity by Congress more than seventeen years ago, but has remained until\r\nrecently a dead letter in the Territory of Utah, because of the peculiar\r\ndifficulties attending its enforcement. The opinion widely prevailed among\r\nthe citizens of Utah that the law was in contravention of the\r\nconstitutional guaranty of religious freedom. This objection is now\r\nremoved. The Supreme Court of the United States has decided the law to be\r\nwithin the legislative power of Congress and binding as a rule of action\r\nfor all who reside within the Territories. There is no longer any reason\r\nfor delay or hesitation in its enforcement. It should be firmly and\r\neffectively executed. If not sufficiently stringent in its provisions, it\r\nshould be amended; and in aid of the purpose in view I recommend that more\r\ncomprehensive and more searching methods for preventing as well as\r\npunishing this crime be provided. If necessary to secure obedience to the\r\nlaw, the enjoyment and exercise of the rights and privileges of citizenship\r\nin the Territories of the United States may be withheld or withdrawn from\r\nthose who violate or oppose the enforcement of the law on this subject.\r\n\r\nThe elections of the past year, though occupied only with State officers,\r\nhave not failed to elicit in the political discussions which attended them\r\nall over the country new and decisive evidence of the deep interest which\r\nthe great body of citizens take in the progress of the country toward a\r\nmore general and complete establishment, at whatever cost, of universal\r\nsecurity and freedom in the exercise of the elective franchise. While many\r\ntopics of political concern demand great attention from our people, both in\r\nthe sphere of national and State authority, I find no reason to qualify the\r\nopinion I expressed in my last annual message, that no temporary or\r\nadministrative interests of government, however urgent or weighty, will\r\never displace the zeal of our people in defense of the primary rights of\r\ncitizenship, and that the power of public opinion will override all\r\npolitical prejudices, and all sectional and State attachments in demanding\r\nthat all over our wide territory the name and character of citizen of the\r\nUnited States shall mean one and the same thing and carry with them\r\nunchallenged security and respect. I earnestly appeal to the intelligence\r\nand patriotism of all good citizens of every part of the country, however\r\nmuch they maybe divided in opinions on other political subjects, to unite\r\nin compelling obedience to existing laws aimed at the protection of the\r\nright of suffrage. I respectfully urge upon Congress to supply any defects\r\nin these laws which experience has shown and which it is within its power\r\nto remedy. I again invoke the cooperation of the executive and legislative\r\nauthorities of the States in this great purpose. I am fully convinced that\r\nif the public mind can be set at rest on this paramount question of popular\r\nrights no serious obstacle will thwart or delay the complete pacification\r\nof the country or retard the general diffusion of prosperity.\r\n\r\nIn a former message I invited the attention of Congress to the subject of\r\nthe reformation of the civil service of the Government, and expressed the\r\nintention of transmitting to Congress as early as practicable a report upon\r\nthis subject by the chairman of the Civil Service Commission.\r\n\r\nIn view of the facts that during a considerable period the Government of\r\nGreat Britain has been dealing with administrative problems and abuses in\r\nvarious particulars analogous to those presented in this country, and that\r\nin recent years the measures adopted were understood to have been effective\r\nand in every respect highly satisfactory, I thought it desirable to have\r\nfuller information upon the subject, and accordingly requested the chairman\r\nof the Civil Service Commission to make a thorough investigation for this\r\npurpose. The result has been an elaborate and comprehensive report.\r\n\r\nThe report sets forth the history of the partisan spoils system in Great\r\nBritain, and of the rise and fall of the parliamentary patronage, and of\r\nofficial interference with the freedom of elections. It shows that after\r\nlong trials of various kinds of examinations those which are competitive\r\nand open on equal terms to all, and which are carried on under the\r\nsuperintendence of a single commission, have, with great advantage, been\r\nestablished as conditions of admission to almost every official place in\r\nthe subordinate administration of that country and of British India. The\r\ncompletion of the report, owing to the extent of the labor involved in its\r\npreparation and the omission of Congress to make any provision either for\r\nthe compensation or the expenses of the Commission, has been postponed\r\nuntil the present time. It is herewith transmitted to Congress.\r\n\r\nWhile the reform measures of another government are of no authority for us,\r\nthey are entitled to influence to the extent to which their intrinsic\r\nwisdom and their adaptation to our institutions and social life may commend\r\nthem to our consideration. The views I have heretofore expressed concerning\r\nthe defects and abuses in our civil administration remain unchanged, except\r\nin so far as an enlarged experience has deepened my sense of the duty both\r\nof officers and of the people themselves to cooperate for their removal.\r\nThe grave evils and perils of a partisan spoils system of appointment to\r\noffice and of office tenure are now generally recognized. In the\r\nresolutions of the great parties, in the reports of Departments, in the\r\ndebates and proceedings of Congress, in the messages of Executives, the\r\ngravity of these evils has been pointed out and the need of their reform\r\nhas been admitted.\r\n\r\nTo command the necessary support, every measure of reform must be based on\r\ncommon right and justice, and must be compatible with the healthy existence\r\nof great parties, which are inevitable and essential in a free state.\r\n\r\nWhen the people have approved a policy at a national election, confidence\r\non the part of the officers they have selected and of the advisers who, in\r\naccordance with our political institutions, should be consulted in the\r\npolicy which it is their duty to carry into effect is indispensable. It is\r\neminently proper that they should explain it before the people, as well as\r\nillustrate its spirit in the performance of their official duties.\r\n\r\nVery different considerations apply to the greater number of those who fill\r\nthe subordinate places in the civil service. Their responsibility is to\r\ntheir superiors in official position. It is their duty to obey the legal\r\ninstructions of those upon whom that authority is devolved, and their best\r\npublic service consists in the discharge of their functions irrespective of\r\npartisan politics. Their duties are the same whatever party is in power and\r\nwhatever policy prevails. As a consequence it follows that their tenure of\r\noffice should not depend on the prevalence of any policy or the supremacy\r\nof any party, but should be determined by their capacity to serve the\r\npeople most usefully quite irrespective of partisan interests. The same\r\nconsiderations that should govern the tenure should also prevail in the\r\nappointment, discipline, and removal of these subordinates. The authority\r\nof appointment and removal is not a perquisite, which may be used to aid a\r\nfriend or reward a partisan, but is a trust, to be exercised in the public\r\ninterest under all the sanctions which attend the obligation to apply the\r\npublic funds only for public purposes.\r\n\r\nEvery citizen has an equal right to the honor and profit of entering the\r\npublic service of his country. The only just ground of discrimination is\r\nthe measure of character and capacity he has to make that service most\r\nuseful to the people. Except in cases where, upon just and recognized\r\nprinciples--as upon the theory of pensions--offices and promotions are\r\nbestowed as rewards for past services, their bestowal upon any theory which\r\ndisregards personal merit is an act of injustice to the citizen, as well as\r\na breach of that trust subject to which the appointing power is held.\r\n\r\nIn the light of these principles it becomes of great importance to provide\r\njust and adequate means, especially for every Department and large\r\nadministrative office, where personal discrimination on the part of its\r\nhead is not practicable, for ascertaining those qualifications to which\r\nappointments and removals should have reference. To fail to provide such\r\nmeans is not only to deny the opportunity of ascertaining the facts upon\r\nwhich the most righteous claim to office depends, but of necessity to\r\ndiscourage all worthy aspirants by handing over appointments and removals\r\nto mere influence and favoritism. If it is the right of the worthiest\r\nclaimant to gain the appointment and the interest of the people to bestow\r\nit upon him, it would seem clear that a wise and just method of\r\nascertaining personal fitness for office must be an important and permanent\r\nfunction of every just and wise government. It has long since become\r\nimpossible in the great offices for those having the duty of nomination and\r\nappointment to personally examine into the individual qualifications of\r\nmore than a small proportion of those seeking office, and with the\r\nenlargement of the civil service that proportion must continue to become\r\nless.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier years of the Government the subordinate offices were so few\r\nin number that it was quite easy for those making appointments and\r\npromotions to personally ascertain the merits of candidates. Party managers\r\nand methods had not then become powerful agencies of coercion, hostile to\r\nthe free and just exercise of the appointing power.\r\n\r\nA large and responsible part of the duty of restoring the civil service to\r\nthe desired purity and efficiency rests upon the President, and it is my\r\npurpose to do what is within my power to advance such prudent and gradual\r\nmeasures of reform as will most surely and rapidly bring about that radical\r\nchange of system essential to make our administrative methods satisfactory\r\nto a free and intelligent people. By a proper exercise of authority it is\r\nin the power of the Executive to do much to promote such a reform. But it\r\ncan not be too clearly understood that nothing adequate can be accomplished\r\nwithout cooperation on the part of Congress and considerate and intelligent\r\nsupport among the people. Reforms which challenge the generally accepted\r\ntheories of parties and demand changes in the methods of Departments are\r\nnot the work of a day. Their permanent foundations must be laid in sound\r\nprinciples and in an experience which demonstrates their wisdom and exposes\r\nthe errors of their adversaries. Every worthy officer desires to make his\r\nofficial action a gain and an honor to his country; but the people\r\nthemselves, far more than their officers in public station, are interested\r\nin a pure, economical, and vigorous administration.\r\n\r\nBy laws enacted in 1853 and 1855, and now in substance incorporated in the\r\nRevised Statutes, the practice of arbitrary appointments to the several\r\nsubordinate grades in the great Departments was condemned, and examinations\r\nas to capacity, to be conducted by departmental boards of examiners, were\r\nprovided for and made conditions of admission to the public service. These\r\nstatutes are a decision by Congress that examinations of some sort as to\r\nattainments and capacity are essential to the well-being of the public\r\nservice. The important questions since the enactment of these laws have\r\nbeen as to the character of these examinations, and whether official favor\r\nand partisan influence or common right and merit were to control the access\r\nto the examinations. In practice these examinations have not always been\r\nopen to worthy persons generally who might wish to be examined. Official\r\nfavoritism and partisan influence, as a rule, appear to have designated\r\nthose who alone were permitted to go before the examining boards,\r\nsubjecting even the examiners to a pressure from the friends of the\r\ncandidates very difficult to resist. As a consequence the standard of\r\nadmission fell below that which the public interest demanded. It was also\r\nalmost inevitable that a system which provided for various separate boards\r\nof examiners, with no common supervision or uniform method of procedure,\r\nshould result in confusion, inconsistency, and inadequate tests of\r\ncapacity, highly detrimental to the public interest. A further and more\r\nradical change was obviously required.\r\n\r\nIn the annual message of December, 1870, my predecessor declared that--\r\nThere is no duty which so much embarrasses the Executive and heads of\r\nDepartments as that of appointments, nor is there any such arduous and\r\nthankless labor imposed on Senators and Representatives as that of finding\r\nplaces for constituents. The present system does not secure the best men,\r\nand often not even fit men, for public place. The elevation and\r\npurification of the civil service of the Government will be hailed with\r\napproval by the whole people of the United States. Congress accordingly\r\npassed the act approved March 3, 1871, \"to regulate the civil service of\r\nthe United States and promote the efficiency thereof,\" giving the necessary\r\nauthority to the Executive to inaugurate a civil-service reform.\r\n\r\nActing under this statute, which was interpreted as intended to secure a\r\nsystem of just and effectual examinations under uniform supervision, a\r\nnumber of eminently competent persons were selected for the purpose, who\r\nentered with zeal upon the discharge of their duties, prepared with an\r\nintelligent appreciation of the requirements of the service the regulations\r\ncontemplated, and took charge of the examinations, and who in their\r\ncapacity as a board have been known as the \"Civil Service Commission.\"\r\nCongress for two years appropriated the money needed for the compensation\r\nand for the expense of carrying on the work of the Commission.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the report of the Commission submitted to the President in\r\nApril, 1874, that examinations had been held in various sections of the\r\ncountry, and that an appropriation of about $25,000 would be required to\r\nmeet the annual expenses, including salaries, involved in discharging the\r\nduties of the Commission. The report was transmitted to Congress by special\r\nmessage of April 18, 1874, with the following favorable comment upon the\r\nlabors of the Commission: If sustained by Congress, I have no doubt the\r\nrules can, after the experience gained, be so improved and enforced as to\r\nstill more materially benefit the public service and relieve the Executive,\r\nmembers of Congress, and the heads of Departments from influences\r\nprejudicial to good administration. The rules, as they have hitherto been\r\nenforced, have resulted beneficially, as is shown by the opinions of the\r\nmembers of the Cabinet and their subordinates in the Departments, and in\r\nthat opinion I concur. And in the annual message of December of the same\r\nyear similar views are expressed and an appropriation for continuing the\r\nwork of the Commission again advised.\r\n\r\nThe appropriation was not made, and as a consequence the active work of the\r\nCommission was suspended, leaving the Commission itself still in existence.\r\nWithout the means, therefore, of causing qualifications to be tested in any\r\nsystematic manner or of securing for the public service the advantages of\r\ncompetition upon any extensive plan, I recommended in my annual message of\r\nDecember, 1877, the making of an appropriation for the resumption of the\r\nwork of the Commission.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, however, competitive examinations, under many\r\nembarrassments, have been conducted within limited spheres in the Executive\r\nDepartments in Washington and in a number of the custom-houses and\r\npost-offices of the principal cities of the country, with a view to further\r\ntest their effects, and in every instance they have been found to be as\r\nsalutary as they are stated to have been under the Administration of my\r\npredecessor. I think the economy, purity, and efficiency of the public\r\nservice would be greatly promoted by their systematic introduction,\r\nwherever practicable, throughout the entire civil service of the\r\nGovernment, together with ample provision for their general supervision in\r\norder to secure consistency and uniform justice.\r\n\r\nReports from the Secretary of the Interior, from the Postmaster-General,\r\nfrom the postmaster in the city of New York, where such examinations have\r\nbeen some time on trial, and also from the collector of the port, the naval\r\nofficer, and the surveyor in that city, and from the postmasters and\r\ncollectors in several of the other large cities, show that the competitive\r\nsystem, where applied, has in various ways contributed to improve the\r\npublic service.\r\n\r\nThe reports show that the results have been salutary in a marked degree,\r\nand that the general application of similar rules can not fail to be of\r\ndecided benefit to the service.\r\n\r\nThe reports of the Government officers, in the city of New York especially,\r\nbear decided testimony to the utility of open competitive examinations in\r\ntheir respective offices, showing that--These examinations and the\r\nexcellent qualifications of those admitted to the service through them have\r\nhad a marked incidental effect upon the persons previously in the service,\r\nand particularly upon those aspiring to promotion. There has been on the\r\npart of these latter an increased interest in the work and a desire to\r\nextend acquaintance with it beyond the particular desk occupied, and thus\r\nthe morale of the entire force has been raised. The examinations have been\r\nattended by many citizens, who have had an opportunity to thoroughly\r\ninvestigate the scope and character of the tests and the method of\r\ndetermining the results, and those visitors have without exception approved\r\nthe methods employed, and several of them have publicly attested their\r\nfavorable opinion. Upon such considerations I deem it my duty to renew the\r\nrecommendation contained in my annual message of December, 1877, requesting\r\nCongress to make the necessary appropriation for the resumption of the work\r\nof the Civil Service Commission. Economy will be promoted by authorizing a\r\nmoderate compensation to persons in the public service who may perform\r\nextra labor upon or under the Commission, as the Executive may direct.\r\n\r\nI am convinced that if a just and adequate test of merit is enforced for\r\nadmission to the public service and in making promotions such abuses as\r\nremovals without good cause and partisan and official interference with the\r\nproper exercise of the appointing power will in large measure disappear.\r\n\r\nThere are other administrative abuses to which the attention of Congress\r\nshould be asked in this connection. Mere partisan appointments and the\r\nconstant peril of removal without cause very naturally lead to an absorbing\r\nand mischievous political activity on the part of those thus appointed,\r\nwhich not only interferes with the due discharge of official duty, but is\r\nincompatible with the freedom of elections. Not without warrant in the\r\nviews of several of my predecessors in the Presidential office, and\r\ndirectly within the law of 1871, already cited, I endeavored, by regulation\r\nmade on the 22d day of June, 1877, to put some reasonable limits to such\r\nabuses. It may not be easy, and it may never perhaps be necessary, to\r\ndefine with precision the proper limit of political action on the part of\r\nFederal officers. But while their right to hold and freely express their\r\nopinions can not be questioned, it is very plain that they should neither\r\nbe allowed to devote to other subjects the time needed for the proper\r\ndischarge of their official duties nor to use the authority of their office\r\nto enforce their own opinions or to coerce the political action of those\r\nwho hold different opinions.\r\n\r\nReasons of justice and public policy quite analogous to those which forbid\r\nthe use of official power for the oppression of the private citizen impose\r\nupon the Government the duty of protecting its officers and agents from\r\narbitrary exactions. In whatever aspect considered, the practice of making\r\nlevies for party purposes upon the salaries of officers is highly\r\ndemoralizing to the public service and discreditable to the country. Though\r\nan officer should be as free as any other citizen to give his own money in\r\naid of his opinions or his party, he should also be as free as any other\r\ncitizen to refuse to make such gifts. If salaries are but a fair\r\ncompensation for the time and labor of the officer, it is gross injustice\r\nto levy a tax upon them. If they are made excessive in order that they may\r\nbear the tax, the excess is an indirect robbery of the public funds.\r\n\r\nI recommend, therefore, such a revision and extension of present statutes\r\nas shall secure to those in every grade of official life or public\r\nemployment the protection with which a great and enlightened nation should\r\nguard those who are faithful in its service.\r\n\r\nOur relations with foreign countries have continued peaceful.\r\n\r\nWith Great Britain there are still unsettled questions, growing out of the\r\nlocal laws of the maritime provinces and the action of provincial\r\nauthorities deemed to be in derogation of rights secured by treaty to\r\nAmerican fishermen. The United States minister in London has been\r\ninstructed to present a demand for $105,305.02 in view of the damages\r\nreceived by American citizens at Fortune Bay on the 6th day of January,\r\n1878. The subject has been taken into consideration by the British\r\nGovernment, and an early reply is anticipated.\r\n\r\nUpon the completion of the necessary preliminary examinations the subject\r\nof our participation in the provincial fisheries, as regulated by treaty,\r\nwill at once be brought to the attention of the British Government, with a\r\nview to an early and permanent settlement of the whole question, which was\r\nonly temporarily adjusted by the treaty of Washington.\r\n\r\nEfforts have been made to obtain the removal of restrictions found\r\ninjurious to the exportation of cattle to the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nSome correspondence has also occurred with regard to the rescue and saving\r\nof life and property upon the Lakes, which has resulted in important\r\nmodifications of the previous regulations of the Dominion government on the\r\nsubject in the interest of humanity and commerce.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the joint resolution of the last session of Congress,\r\ncommissioners were appointed to represent the United States at the two\r\ninternational exhibitions in Australia, one of which is now in progress at\r\nSydney, and the other to be held next year at Melbourne. A desire has been\r\nexpressed by our merchants and manufacturers interested in the important\r\nand growing trade with Australia that an increased provision should be made\r\nby Congress for the representation of our industries at the Melbourne\r\nexhibition of next year, and the subject is respectfully submitted to your\r\nfavorable consideration.\r\n\r\nThe assent of the Government has been given to the landing on the coast of\r\nMassachusetts of a new and independent transatlantic cable between France,\r\nby way of the French island of St. Pierre, and this country, subject to any\r\nfuture legislation of Congress on the subject. The conditions imposed\r\nbefore allowing this connection with our shores to be established are such\r\nas to secure its competition with any existing or future lines of marine\r\ncable and preclude amalgamation therewith, to provide for entire equality\r\nof rights to our Government and people with those of France in the use of\r\nthe cable, and prevent any exclusive possession of the privilege as\r\naccorded by France to the disadvantage of any future cable communication\r\nbetween France and the United States which may be projected and\r\naccomplished by our citizens. An important reduction of the present rates\r\nof cable communication with Europe, felt to be too burdensome to the\r\ninterests of our commerce, must necessarily flow from the establishment of\r\nthis competing line.\r\n\r\nThe attention of Congress was drawn to the propriety of some general\r\nregulation by Congress of the whole subject of transmarine cables by my\r\npredecessor in his message of December 7, 1875, and I respectfully submit\r\nto your consideration the importance of Congressional action in the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nThe questions of grave importance with Spain growing out of the incidents\r\nof the Cuban insurrection have been for the most part happily and honorably\r\nsettled. It may reasonably be anticipated that the commission now sitting\r\nin Washington for the decision of private cases in this connection will\r\nsoon be able to bring its labors to a conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe long-standing question of East Florida claims has lately been renewed\r\nas a subject of correspondence, and may possibly require Congressional\r\naction for its final disposition.\r\n\r\nA treaty with the Netherlands with respect to consular rights and\r\nprivileges similar to those with other powers has been signed and ratified,\r\nand the ratifications were exchanged on the 31st of July last. Negotiations\r\nfor extradition treaties with the Netherlands and with Denmark are now in\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nSome questions with Switzerland in regard to pauper and convict emigrants\r\nhave arisen, but it is not doubted that they will be arranged upon a just\r\nand satisfactory basis. A question has also occurred with respect to an\r\nasserted claim by Swiss municipal authorities to exercise tutelage over\r\npersons and property of Swiss citizens naturalized in this country. It is\r\npossible this may require adjustment by treaty.\r\n\r\nWith the German Empire frequent questions arise in connection with the\r\nSubjects of naturalization and expatriation, but the Imperial Government\r\nhas constantly manifested a desire to strictly maintain and comply with all\r\ntreaty stipulations in regard to them.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the omission of Congress to provide for a diplomatic\r\nrepresentative at Athens, the legation to Greece has been withdrawn. There\r\nis now no channel of diplomatic communication between the two countries,\r\nand the expediency of providing for one in some form is submitted to\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nRelations with Austria, Russia, Italy, Portugal, Turkey, and Belgium\r\ncontinue amicable, and marked by no incident of especial importance.\r\n\r\nA change of the personal head of the Government of Egypt has taken place.\r\nNo change, however, has occurred in the relations between Egypt and the\r\nUnited States. The action of the Egyptian Government in presenting to the\r\ncity of New York one of the ancient obelisks, which possess such historic\r\ninterest, is highly appreciated as a generous mark of international regard.\r\nIf prosperity should attend the enterprise of its transportation across the\r\nAtlantic, its erection in a conspicuous position in the chief commercial\r\ncity of the nation will soon be accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe treaty recently made between Japan and the United States in regard to\r\nthe revision of former commercial treaties it is now believed will be\r\nfollowed by similar action on the part of other treaty powers. The\r\nattention of Congress is again invited to the subject of the indemnity\r\nfunds received some years since from Japan and China, which, with their\r\naccumulated interest, now amount to considerable sums. If any part of these\r\nfunds is justly due to American citizens, they should receive it promptly;\r\nand whatever may have been received by this Government in excess of\r\nstrictly just demands should in some form be returned to the nations to\r\nwhom it equitably belongs.\r\n\r\nThe Government of China has signified its willingness to consider the\r\nquestion of the emigration of its subjects to the United States with a\r\ndispassionate fairness and to cooperate in such measures as may tend to\r\nprevent injurious consequences to the United States. The negotiations are\r\nstill proceeding, and will be pressed with diligence.\r\n\r\nA question having arisen between China and Japan about the Lew Chew\r\nIslands, the United States Government has taken measures to inform those\r\npowers of its readiness to extend its good offices for the maintenance of\r\npeace if they shall mutually deem it desirable and find it practicable to\r\navail themselves of the proffer.\r\n\r\nIt is a gratification to be able to announce that, through the judicious\r\nand energetic action of the military commanders of the two nations on each\r\nside of the Rio Grande, under the instructions of their respective\r\nGovernments, raids and depredations have greatly decreased, and in the\r\nlocalities where formerly most destructive have now almost wholly ceased.\r\nIn view of this result, I entertain a confident expectation that the\r\nprevalence of quiet on the border will soon become so assured as to justify\r\na modification of the present orders to our military commanders as to\r\ncrossing the border, without encouraging such disturbances as would\r\nendanger the peace of the two countries.\r\n\r\nThe third installment of the award against Mexico under the claims\r\ncommission of July 4, 1868, was duly paid, and has been put in course of\r\ndistribution in pursuance of the act of Congress providing for the same.\r\nThis satisfactory situation between the two countries leads me to\r\nanticipate an expansion of our trade with Mexico and an increased\r\ncontribution of capital and industry by our people to the development of\r\nthe great resources of that country. I earnestly commend to the wisdom of\r\nCongress the provision of suitable legislation looking to this result.\r\n\r\nDiplomatic intercourse with Colombia is again fully restored by the arrival\r\nof a minister from that country to the United States. This is especially\r\nfortunate in view of the fact that the question of an inter-oceanic canal\r\nhas recently assumed a new and important aspect and is now under discussion\r\nwith the Central American countries through whose territory the canal, by\r\nthe Nicaragua route, would have to pass. It is trusted that enlightened\r\nstatesmanship on their part will see that the early prosecution of such a\r\nwork will largely inure to the benefit, not only of their own citizens and\r\nthose of the United States, but of the commerce of the civilized world. It\r\nis not doubted that should the work be undertaken under the protective\r\nauspices of the United States, and upon satisfactory concessions for the\r\nright of way and its security by the Central American Governments, the\r\ncapital for its completion would be readily furnished from this country and\r\nEurope, which might, failing such guaranties, prove inaccessible.\r\n\r\nDiplomatic relations with Chile have also been strengthened by the\r\nreception of a minister from that country.\r\n\r\nThe war between Peru, Bolivia, and Chile still continues. The United States\r\nhave not deemed it proper to interpose in the matter further than to convey\r\nto all the Governments concerned the assurance that the friendly offices of\r\nthe Government of the United States for the restoration of peace upon an\r\nhonorable basis will be extended in case the belligerents shall exhibit a\r\nreadiness to accept them.\r\n\r\nCordial relations continue with Brazil and the Argentine Republic, and\r\ntrade with those countries is improving. A provision for regular and more\r\nfrequent mail communication, in our own ships, between the ports of this\r\ncountry and the nations of South America seems to me to deserve the\r\nattention of Congress as an essential precursor of an enlargement of our\r\ncommerce with them and an extension of our carrying trade.\r\n\r\nA recent revolution in Venezuela has been followed by the establishment of\r\na provisional government. This government has not yet been formally\r\nrecognized, and it is deemed desirable to await the proposed action of the\r\npeople which is expected to give it the sanction of constitutional forms.\r\n\r\nA naval vessel has been sent to the Samoan Islands to make surveys and take\r\npossession of the privileges ceded to the United States by Samoa in the\r\nharbor of Pago-Pago. A coaling station is to be established there, which\r\nwill be convenient and useful to United States vessels.\r\n\r\nThe subject of opening diplomatic relations with Roumania and Servia, now\r\nbecome independent sovereignties, is at present under consideration, and is\r\nthe subject of diplomatic correspondence.\r\n\r\nThere is a gratifying increase of trade with nearly all European and\r\nAmerican countries, and it is believed that with judicious action in regard\r\nto its development it can and will be still more enhanced and that American\r\nproducts and manufactures will find new and expanding markets. The reports\r\nof diplomatic and consular officers upon this subject, under the system now\r\nadopted, have resulted in obtaining much valuable information, which has\r\nbeen and will continue to be laid before Congress and the public from time\r\nto time.\r\n\r\nThe third article of the treaty with Russia of March 30, 1867, by which\r\nAlaska was ceded to the United States, provides that the inhabitants of the\r\nceded territory, with the exception of the uncivilized native tribes, shall\r\nbe admitted to the enjoyment of all the rights of citizens of the United\r\nStates and shall be maintained and protected in the free enjoyment of their\r\nliberty, property, and religion. The uncivilized tribes are subject to such\r\nlaws and regulations as the United States may from time to time adopt in\r\nregard to the aboriginal tribes of that country.\r\n\r\nBoth the obligations of this treaty and the necessities of the people\r\nrequire that some organized form of government over the Territory of Alaska\r\nbe adopted.\r\n\r\nThere appears to be no law for the arrest of persons charged with\r\ncommon-law offenses, such as assault, robbery, and murder, and no\r\nmagistrate authorized to issue or execute process in such cases. Serious\r\ndifficulties have already arisen from offenses of this character, not only\r\namong the original inhabitants, but among citizens of the United States and\r\nother countries who have engaged in mining, fishing, and other business\r\noperations within the territory. A bill authorizing the appointment of\r\njustices of the peace and constables and the arrest and detention of\r\npersons charged with criminal offenses, and providing for an appeal to\r\nUnited States courts for the district of Oregon in suitable cases, will at\r\na proper time be submitted to Congress.\r\n\r\nThe attention of Congress is called to the annual report of the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury on the condition of the public finances.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary revenues from all sources for the fiscal year ended June 30,\r\n1879, were $273,827,184.46; the ordinary expenditures for the same period\r\nwere $266,947,883.53, leaving a surplus revenue for the year of\r\n$6,879,300.93.\r\n\r\nThe receipts for the present fiscal year, ending June 30, 1880, actual and\r\nestimated, are as follows: Actual receipts for the first quarter,\r\ncommencing July 1, 1879, $79,843,663.61; estimated receipts for the\r\nremaining three quarters of the year, $208,156,336.39; total receipts for\r\nthe current fiscal year, actual and estimated, $288,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe expenditures for the same period will be, actual and estimated, as\r\nfollows: For the quarter commencing July 1, 1879, actual expenditures,\r\n$91,683,385.10; and for the remaining three quarters of the year the\r\nexpenditures are estimated at $172,316,614.90, making the total\r\nexpenditures $264,000,000, and leaving an estimated surplus revenue for the\r\nyear ending June 30, 1880, of $24,000,000. The total receipts during the\r\nnext fiscal year, ending June 30, 1881, estimated according to existing\r\nlaws, will be $288,000,000, and the estimated ordinary expenditures for the\r\nsame period will be $278,097,364.39, leaving a surplus of $9,902,635.61 for\r\nthat year.\r\n\r\nThe large amount expended for arrears of pensions during the last and the\r\npresent fiscal year, amounting to $21,747,249.60, has prevented the\r\napplication of the full amount required by law to the sinking fund for the\r\ncurrent year; but these arrears having been substantially paid, it is\r\nbelieved that the sinking fund can hereafter be maintained without any\r\nchange of existing law.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War reports that the War Department estimates for the\r\nfiscal year ending June 30, 1881, are $40,380,428.93, the same being for a\r\nless sum of money than any annual estimate rendered to Congress from that\r\nDepartment during a period of at least twelve years.\r\n\r\nHe concurs with the General of the Army in recommending such legislation as\r\nwill authorize the enlistment of the full number of 25,000 men for the line\r\nof the Army, exclusive of the 3,463 men required for detached duty, and\r\ntherefore not available for service in the field.\r\n\r\nHe also recommends that Congress be asked to provide by law for the\r\ndisposition of a large number of abandoned military posts and reservations,\r\nwhich, though very valuable in themselves, have been rendered useless for\r\nmilitary purposes by the advance of civilization and settlement.\r\n\r\nHe unites with the Quartermaster-General in recommending that an\r\nappropriation be made for the construction of a cheap and perfectly\r\nfireproof building for the safe storage of a vast amount of money accounts,\r\nvouchers, claims, and other valuable records now in the\r\nQuartermaster-General's Office, and exposed to great risk of total\r\ndestruction by fire.\r\n\r\nHe also recommends, in conformity with the views of the\r\nJudge-Advocate-General, some declaratory legislation in reference to the\r\nmilitary statute of limitations as applied to the crime of desertion. In\r\nthese several recommendations I concur.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War further reports that the work for the improvement of\r\nthe South Pass of the Mississippi River, under contract with Mr. James B.\r\nEads, made in pursuance of an act of Congress, has been prosecuted during\r\nthe past year with a greater measure of success in the attainment of\r\nresults than during any previous year. The channel through the South Pass,\r\nwhich at the beginning of operations in June, 1875, had a depth of only 7\r\n1/2 feet of water, had on the 8th of July, 1879, a minimum depth of 26\r\nfeet, having a width of not less than 200 feet and a central depth of 30\r\nfeet. Payments have been made in accordance with the statute, as the work\r\nprogressed, amounting in the aggregate to $4,250,000; and further payments\r\nwill become due, as provided by the statute, in the event of success in\r\nmaintaining the channel now secured.\r\n\r\nThe reports of the General of the Army and of his subordinates present a\r\nfull and detailed account of the military operations for the suppression of\r\nhostilities among the Indians of the Ute and Apache tribes, and praise is\r\njustly awarded to the officers and troops engaged for promptness, skill,\r\nand courage displayed.\r\n\r\nThe past year has been one of almost unbroken peace and quiet on the\r\nMexican frontier, and there is reason to believe that the efforts of this\r\nGovernment and of Mexico to maintain order in that region will prove\r\npermanently successful.\r\n\r\nThis Department was enabled during the past year to find temporary, though\r\ncrowded, accommodations and a safe depository for a portion of its records\r\nin the completed east wing of the building designed for the State, War, and\r\nNavy Departments. The construction of the north wing of the building, a\r\npart of the structure intended for the use of the War Department, is being\r\ncarried forward with all possible dispatch, and the work should receive\r\nfrom Congress such liberal appropriations as will secure its speedy\r\ncompletion.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Navy shows continued improvement in that\r\nbranch of the service during the last fiscal year. Extensive repairs have\r\nbeen made upon vessels, and two new ships have been completed and made\r\nready for sea.\r\n\r\nThe total expenditures of the year ended June 30, 1879, including specific\r\nappropriations not estimated for by the Department, were $13,555,710.09.\r\nThe expenses chargeable to the year, after deducting the amount of these\r\nspecific appropriations, were $13,343,317.79; but this is subject to a\r\nreduction of $283,725.99, that amount having been drawn upon warrants, but\r\nnot paid out during the year. The amount of appropriations applicable to\r\nthe last fiscal year was $14,538,646.17. There was, therefore, a balance of\r\n$1,479,054.37 remaining unexpended and to the credit of the Department on\r\nJune 30, 1879. The estimates for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1881, are\r\n$14,864,147.95, which exceeds the appropriations for the present fiscal\r\nyear $361,897.28. The reason for this increase is explained in the\r\nSecretary's report. The appropriations available for the present fiscal\r\nyear are $14,502,250.67, which will, in the opinion of the Secretary,\r\nanswer all the ordinary demands of the service. The amount drawn from the\r\nTreasury from July 1 to November 1, 1879 was $5,770,404.12, of which\r\n$1,095,440.33 has been refunded, leaving as the expenditure for that period\r\n$4,674,963.79. If the expenditures of the remaining two-thirds of the year\r\ndo not exceed the proportion for these four months, there will remain\r\nunexpended at the end of the year $477,359.30 of the current\r\nappropriations. The report of the Secretary shows the gratifying fact that\r\namong all the disbursing officers of the Pay Corps of the Navy there is not\r\none who is a defaulter to the extent of a single dollar. I unite with him\r\nin recommending the removal of the observatory to a more healthful\r\nlocation. That institution reflects credit upon the nation, and has\r\nobtained the approbation of scientific men in all parts of the world. Its\r\nremoval from its present location would not only be conducive to the health\r\nof its officers and professors, but would greatly increase its usefulness.\r\n\r\nThe appropriation for judicial expenses, which has heretofore been made for\r\nthe Department of Justice in gross, was subdivided at the last session of\r\nCongress, and no appropriation whatever was made for the payment of the\r\nfees of marshals and their deputies, either in the service of process or\r\nfor the discharge of other duties; and since June 30 these officers have\r\ncontinued the performance of their duties without compensation from the\r\nGovernment, taking upon themselves the necessary incidental outlays, as\r\nwell as rendering their own services. In only a few unavoidable instances\r\nhas the proper execution of the process of the United States failed by\r\nreason of the absence of the requisite appropriation. This course of\r\nofficial conduct on the part of these officers, highly creditable to their\r\nfidelity, was advised by the Attorney-General, who informed them, however,\r\nthat they would necessarily have to rely for their compensation upon the\r\nprospect of future legislation by Congress. I therefore especially\r\nrecommend that immediate appropriation be made by Congress for this\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nThe act making the principal appropriation for the Department of Justice at\r\nprevious sessions has uniformly contained the following clause: And for\r\ndefraying the expenses which my be incurred in the enforcement of the act\r\napproved February 28, 1871, entitled \"An act to amend an act approved May\r\n31, 1870, entitled 'An act to enforce the rights of citizens of the United\r\nStates to vote in the several States of this Union, and for other\r\npurposes,'\" or any acts amendatory thereof or supplementary thereto. No\r\nappropriation was made for this purpose for the current year. As no general\r\nelection for Members of Congress occurred, the omission was a matter of\r\nlittle practical importance. Such election will, however, take place during\r\nthe ensuing year, and the appropriation made for the pay of marshals and\r\ndeputies should be sufficient to embrace compensation for the services they\r\nmay be required to perform at such elections.\r\n\r\nThe business of the Supreme Court is at present largely in arrears. It can\r\nnot be expected that more causes can be decided than are now disposed of in\r\nits annual session, or that by any assiduity the distinguished magistrates\r\nwho compose the court can accomplish more than is now done. In the courts\r\nof many of the circuits also the business has increased to such an extent\r\nthat the delay of justice will call the attention of Congress to an\r\nappropriate remedy. It is believed that all is done in each circuit which\r\ncan fairly be expected from its judicial force. The evils arising from\r\ndelay are less heavily felt by the United States than by private suitors,\r\nas its causes are advanced by the courts when it is seen that they involve\r\nthe discussion of questions of a public character.\r\n\r\nThe remedy suggested by the Attorney-General is the appointment of\r\nadditional circuit judges and the creation of an intermediate court of\r\nerrors and appeals, which shall relieve the Supreme Court of a part of its\r\njurisdiction, while a larger force is also obtained for the performance of\r\ncircuit duties.\r\n\r\nI commend this suggestion to the consideration of Congress. It would seem\r\nto afford a complete remedy, and would involve, if ten additional circuit\r\njudges are appointed, an expenditure, at the present rate of salaries, of\r\nnot more than $60,000 a year, which would certainly be small in comparison\r\nwith the objects to be attained.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster-General bears testimony to the general revival\r\nof business throughout the country. The receipts of the Post-Office\r\nDepartment for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1879, were $30,041,982.86,\r\nbeing $764,465.91 more than the revenues of the preceding year. The amount\r\nrealized from the sale of postage stamps, stamped envelopes, and postal\r\ncards was $764,465.91 more than in the preceding year, and $2,387,559.23\r\nmore than in 1877. The expenditures of the Department were $33,449,899.45,\r\nof which the sum of $376,461.63 was paid on liabilities incurred in\r\npreceding years.\r\n\r\nThe expenditures during the year were $801,209.77 less than in the\r\npreceding year. This reduction is to be attributed mainly to the operation\r\nof the law passed June 17, 1878, changing the compensation of postmasters\r\nfrom a commission on the value of stamps sold to a commission on stamps\r\ncanceled.\r\n\r\nThe amount drawn from the Treasury on appropriations, in addition to the\r\nrevenues of the Department, was $3,031,454.96, being $2,276,197.86 less\r\nthan in the preceding year.\r\n\r\nThe expenditures for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1881, are estimated at\r\n$39,920,900 and the receipts from all sources at $32,210,000, leaving a\r\ndeficiency to be appropriated for out of the Treasury of $7,710,900.\r\n\r\nThe relations of the Department with railroad companies have been\r\nharmonized, notwithstanding the general reduction by Congress of their\r\ncompensation by the appropriation for special facilities, and the railway\r\npost-office lines have been greatly extended, especially in the Southern\r\nStates. The interests of the Railway Mail Service and of the public would\r\nbe greatly promoted and the expenditures could be more readily controlled\r\nby the classification of the employees of the Railway Mail Service as\r\nrecommended by the Postmaster-General, the appropriation for salaries, with\r\nrespect to which the maximum limit is already fixed by law, to be made in\r\ngross.\r\n\r\nThe Postmaster-General recommends an amendment of the law regulating the\r\nincrease of compensation for increased service and increased speed on star\r\nroutes, so as to enable him to advertise for proposals for such increased\r\nservice and speed. He also suggests the advantages to accrue to the\r\ncommerce of the country from the enactment of a general law authorizing\r\ncontracts with American-built steamers, carrying the American flag, for\r\ntransporting the mail between ports of the United States and ports of the\r\nWest Indies and South America, at a fixed maximum price per mile, the\r\namount to be expended being regulated by annual appropriations, in like\r\nmanner with the amount paid for the domestic star service.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement made by the Postmaster-General and the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury for the collection of duty upon books received in the mail from\r\nforeign countries has proved so satisfactory in its practical operation\r\nthat the recommendation is now made that Congress shall extend the\r\nprovisions of the act of March 3, 1879, under which this arrangement was\r\nmade, so as to apply to all other dutiable articles received in the mails\r\nfrom foreign countries.\r\n\r\nThe reports of the Secretary of the Interior and of the Commissioner of\r\nIndian Affairs, setting forth the present state of our relations with the\r\nIndian tribes on our territory, the measures taken to advance their\r\ncivilization and prosperity, and the progress already achieved by them,\r\nwill be found of more than ordinary interest. The general conduct of our\r\nIndian population has been so satisfactory that the occurrence of two\r\ndisturbances, which resulted in bloodshed and destruction of property, is\r\nall the more to be lamented.\r\n\r\nThe history of the outbreak on the White River Ute Reservation, in western\r\nColorado, has become so familiar by elaborate reports in the public press\r\nthat its remarkable incidents need not be stated here in detail. It is\r\nexpected that the settlement of this difficulty will lead to such\r\narrangements as will prevent further hostile contact between the Indians\r\nand the border settlements in western Colorado.\r\n\r\nThe other disturbance occurred at the Mescalero Agency, in New Mexico,\r\nwhere Victoria, at the head of a small band of marauders, after committing\r\nmany atrocities, being vigorously chased by a military force, made his way\r\nacross the Mexican border and is now on foreign soil.\r\n\r\nWhile these occurrences, in which a comparatively small number of Indians\r\nwere engaged, are most deplorable, a vast majority of our Indian population\r\nhave fully justified the expectations of those who believe that by humane\r\nand peaceful influences the Indian can be led to abandon the habits of\r\nsavage life and to develop a capacity for useful and civilized occupations.\r\nWhat they have already accomplished in the pursuit of agricultural and\r\nmechanical work, the remarkable success which has attended the experiment\r\nof employing as freighters a class of Indians hitherto counted among the\r\nwildest and most intractable, and the general and urgent desire expressed\r\nby them for the education of their children may be taken as sufficient\r\nproof that they will be found capable of accomplishing much more if they\r\ncontinue to be wisely and fairly guided. The \"Indian policy\" sketched in\r\nthe report of the Secretary of the Interior, the object of which is to make\r\nliberal provision for the education of Indian youth, to settle the Indians\r\nupon farm lots in severalty, to give them title in fee to their farms,\r\ninalienable for a certain number of years, and when their wants are thus\r\nprovided for to dispose by sale of the lands on their reservations not\r\noccupied and used by them, a fund to be formed out of the proceeds for the\r\nbenefit of the Indians, which will gradually relieve the Government of the\r\nexpenses now provided for by annual appropriations, must commend itself as\r\njust and beneficial to the Indians, and as also calculated to remove those\r\nobstructions which the existence of large reservations presents to the\r\nsettlement and development of the country. I therefore earnestly recommend\r\nthe enactment of a law enabling the Government to give Indians a title in\r\nfee, inalienable for twenty-five years, to the farm lands assigned to them\r\nby allotment. I also repeat the recommendation made in my first annual\r\nmessage, that a law be passed admitting Indians who can give satisfactory\r\nproof of having by their own labor supported their families for a number of\r\nyears, and who are willing to detach themselves from their tribal\r\nrelations, to the benefit of the homestead act, and to grant them patents\r\ncontaining the same provision of inalienability for a certain period.\r\n\r\nThe experiment of sending a number of Indian children of both sexes to the\r\nHampton Normal and Agricultural Institute, in Virginia, to receive an\r\nelementary English education and practical instruction in farming and other\r\nuseful industries, has led to results so promising that it was thought\r\nexpedient to turn over the cavalry barracks at Carlisle, in Pennsylvania,\r\nto the Interior Department for the establishment of an Indian school on a\r\nlarger scale. This school has now 158 pupils, selected from various tribes,\r\nand is in full operation. Arrangements are also made for the education of a\r\nnumber of Indian boys and girls belonging to tribes on the Pacific Slope in\r\na similar manner, at Forest Grove, in Oregon. These institutions will\r\ncommend themselves to the liberality of Congress and to the philanthropic\r\nmunificence of the American people.\r\n\r\nLast spring information was received of the organization of an extensive\r\nmovement in the Western States, the object of which was the occupation by\r\nunauthorized persons of certain lands in the Indian Territory ceded by the\r\nCherokees to the Government for the purpose of settlement by other Indian\r\ntribes.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of April I issued a proclamation warning all persons against\r\nparticipation in such an attempt, and by the cooperation of a military\r\nforce the invasion was promptly checked. It is my purpose to protect the\r\nrights of the Indian inhabitants of that Territory to the full extent of\r\nthe executive power; but it would be unwise to ignore the fact that a\r\nterritory so large and so fertile, with a population so sparse and with so\r\ngreat a wealth of unused resources, will be found more exposed to the\r\nrepetition of such attempts as happened this year when the surrounding\r\nStates are more densely settled and the westward movement of our population\r\nlooks still more eagerly for fresh lands to occupy. Under such\r\ncircumstances the difficulty of maintaining the Indian Territory in its\r\npresent state will greatly increase, and the Indian tribes inhabiting it\r\nwould do well to prepare for such a contingency. I therefore fully approve\r\nof the advice given to them by the Secretary of the Interior on a recent\r\noccasion, to divide among themselves in severalty as large a quantity of\r\ntheir lands as they can cultivate; to acquire individual title in fee\r\ninstead of their present tribal ownership in common, and to consider in\r\nwhat manner the balance of their lands may be disposed of by the Government\r\nfor their benefit. By adopting such a policy they would more certainly\r\nsecure for themselves the value of their possessions, and at the same time\r\npromote their progress in civilization and prosperity, than by endeavoring\r\nto perpetuate the present state of things in the Territory.\r\n\r\nThe question whether a change in the control of the Indian service should\r\nbe made was in the Forty-fifth Congress referred to a joint committee of\r\nboth Houses for inquiry and report. In my last annual message I expressed\r\nthe hope that the decision of that question, then in prospect, would\r\n\"arrest further agitation of this subject, such agitation being apt to\r\nproduce a disturbing effect upon the service as well as on the Indians\r\nthemselves.\" Since then, the committee having reported, the question has\r\nbeen decided in the negative by a vote in the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nFor the reasons here stated, and in view of the fact that further\r\nuncertainty on this point will be calculated to obstruct other much-needed\r\nlegislation, to weaken the discipline of the service, and to unsettle\r\nsalutary measures now in progress for the government and improvement of the\r\nIndians, I respectfully recommend that the decision arrived at by Congress\r\nat its last session be permitted to stand.\r\n\r\nThe efforts made by the Department of the Interior to arrest the\r\ndepredations on the timber lands of the United States have been continued,\r\nand have met with considerable success. A large number of cases of trespass\r\nhave been prosecuted in the courts of the United States; others have been\r\nsettled, the trespassers offering to make payment to the Government for the\r\nvalue of the timber taken by them. The proceeds of these prosecutions and\r\nsettlements turned into the Treasury far exceed in amount the sums\r\nappropriated by Congress for this purpose. A more important result,\r\nhowever, consists in the fact that the destruction of our public forests by\r\ndepredation, although such cases still occur, has been greatly reduced in\r\nextent, and it is probable that if the present policy is vigorously pursued\r\nand sufficient provision to that end is made by Congress such trespasses,\r\nat least those on a large scale, can be entirely suppressed, except in the\r\nTerritories, where timber for the daily requirements of the population can\r\nnot, under the present state of the law, be otherwise obtained. I therefore\r\nearnestly invite the attention of Congress to the recommendation made by\r\nthe Secretary of the Interior, that a law be enacted enabling the\r\nGovernment to sell timber from the public lands without conveying the fee,\r\nwhere such lands are principally valuable for the timber thereon, such\r\nsales to be so regulated as to conform to domestic wants and business\r\nrequirements, while at the same time guarding against a sweeping\r\ndestruction of the forests. The enactment of such a law appears to become a\r\nmore pressing necessity every day.\r\n\r\nMy recommendations in former messages are renewed in favor of enlarging the\r\nfacilities of the Department of Agriculture. Agriculture is the leading\r\ninterest and the permanent industry of our people. It is to the abundance\r\nof agricultural production, as compared with our home consumption, and the\r\nlargely increased and highly profitable market abroad which we have enjoyed\r\nin recent years, that we are mainly indebted for our present prosperity as\r\na people. We must look for its continued maintenance to the same\r\nsubstantial resource. There is no branch of industry in which labor,\r\ndirected by scientific knowledge, yields such increased production in\r\ncomparison with unskilled labor, and no branch of the public service to\r\nwhich the encouragement of liberal appropriations can be more appropriately\r\nextended. The omission to render such aid is not a wise economy, but, on\r\nthe contrary, undoubtedly results in losses of immense sums annually that\r\nmight be saved through well-directed efforts by the Government to promote\r\nthis vital interest.\r\n\r\nThe results already accomplished with the very limited means heretofore\r\nplaced at the command of the Department of Agriculture is an earnest of\r\nwhat may be expected with increased appropriations for the several purposes\r\nindicated in the report of the Commissioner, with a view to placing the\r\nDepartment upon a footing which will enable it to prosecute more\r\neffectively the objects for which it is established.\r\n\r\nAppropriations are needed for a more complete laboratory, for the\r\nestablishment of a veterinary division and a division of forestry, and for\r\nan increase of force.\r\n\r\nThe requirements for these and other purposes, indicated in the report of\r\nthe Commissioner under the head of the immediate necessities of the\r\nDepartment, will not involve any expenditure of money that the country can\r\nnot with propriety now undertake in the interests of agriculture.\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to learn from the Bureau of Education the extent to which\r\neducational privileges throughout the United States have been advanced\r\nduring the year. No more fundamental responsibility rests upon Congress\r\nthan that of devising appropriate measures of financial aid to education,\r\nsupplemental to local action in the States and Territories and in the\r\nDistrict of Columbia. The wise forethought of the founders of our\r\nGovernment has not only furnished the basis for the support of the\r\ncommon-school systems of the newer States, but laid the foundations for the\r\nmaintenance of their universities and colleges of agriculture and the\r\nmechanic arts. Measures in accordance with this traditional policy, for the\r\nfurther benefit of all these interests and the extension of the same\r\nadvantages to every portion of the country, it is hoped will receive your\r\nfavorable consideration.\r\n\r\nTo preserve and perpetuate the national literature should be among the\r\nforemost cares of the National Legislature. The library gathered at the\r\nCapitol still remains unprovided with any suitable accommodations for its\r\nrapidly increasing stores. The magnitude and importance of the collection,\r\nincreased as it is by the deposits made under the law of copyright, by\r\ndomestic and foreign exchanges, and by the scientific library of the\r\nSmithsonian Institution, call for building accommodations which shall be at\r\nonce adequate and fireproof. The location of such a public building, which\r\nshould provide for the pressing necessities of the present and for the vast\r\nincrease of the nation's books in the future, is a matter which addresses\r\nitself to the discretion of Congress. It is earnestly recommended as a\r\nmeasure which should unite all suffrages and which should no longer be\r\ndelayed.\r\n\r\nThe joint commission created by the act of Congress of August 2, 1876, for\r\nthe purpose of supervising and directing the completion of the Washington\r\nNational Monument, of which commission the President is a member, has given\r\ncareful attention to this subject, and already the strengthening of the\r\nfoundation has so far progressed as to insure the entire success of this\r\npart of the work. A massive layer of masonry has been introduced below the\r\noriginal foundation, widening the base, increasing the stability of the\r\nstructure, and rendering it possible to carry the shaft to completion. It\r\nis earnestly recommended that such further appropriations be made for the\r\ncontinued prosecution of the work as may be necessary for the completion of\r\nthis national monument at an early day.\r\n\r\nIn former messages, impressed with the importance of the subject, I have\r\ntaken occasion to commend to Congress the adoption of a generous policy\r\ntoward the District of Columbia. The report of the Commissioners of the\r\nDistrict, herewith transmitted, contains suggestions and recommendations,\r\nto all of which I earnestly invite your careful attention. I ask your early\r\nand favorable consideration of the views which they express as to the\r\nurgent need of legislation for the reclamation of the marshes of the\r\nPotomac and its Eastern Branch within the limits of the city, and for the\r\nrepair of the streets of the capital, heretofore laid with wooden blocks\r\nand now by decay rendered almost impassable and a source of imminent danger\r\nto the health of its citizens. The means at the disposal of the\r\nCommissioners are wholly inadequate for the accomplishment of these\r\nimportant works, and should be supplemented by timely appropriations from\r\nthe Federal Treasury.\r\n\r\nThe filling of the flats in front of the city will add to the adjacent\r\nlands and parks now owned by the United States a large and valuable domain,\r\nsufficient, it is thought, to reimburse its entire cost, and will also, as\r\nan incidental result, secure the permanent improvement of the river for the\r\npurposes of navigation.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution having invested Congress with supreme and exclusive\r\njurisdiction over the District of Columbia, its citizens must of necessity\r\nlook to Congress alone for all needful legislation affecting their\r\ninterests; and as the territory of this District is the common property of\r\nthe people of the United States, who equally with its resident citizens are\r\ninterested in the prosperity of their capital, I can not doubt that you\r\nwill be amply sustained by the general voice of the country in any measures\r\nyou may adopt for this purpose.\r\n\r\nI also invite the favorable consideration of Congress to the wants of the\r\npublic schools of this District, as exhibited in the report of the\r\nCommissioners. While the number of pupils is rapidly increasing, no\r\nadequate provision exists for a corresponding increase of school\r\naccommodation, and the Commissioners are without the means to meet this\r\nurgent need. A number of the buildings now used for school purposes are\r\nrented, and are in important particulars unsuited for the purpose. The\r\ncause of popular education in the District of Columbia is surely entitled\r\nto the same consideration at the hands of the National Government as in the\r\nseveral States and Territories, to which munificent grants of the public\r\nlands have been made for the endowment of schools and universities.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nRutherford B. Hayes\r\nDecember 6, 1880\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nI congratulate you on the continued and increasing prosperity of our\r\ncountry. By the favor of Divine Providence we have been blessed during the\r\npast year with health, with abundant harvests, with profitable employment\r\nfor all our people, and with contentment at home, and with peace and\r\nfriendship with other nations. The occurrence of the twenty-fourth election\r\nof Chief Magistrate has afforded another opportunity to the people of the\r\nUnited States to exhibit to the world a significant example of the peaceful\r\nand safe transmission of the power and authority of government from the\r\npublic servants whose terms of office are about to expire to their newly\r\nchosen successors. This example can not fail to impress profoundly\r\nthoughtful people of other countries with the advantages which republican\r\ninstitutions afford. The immediate, general, and cheerful acquiescence of\r\nall good citizens in the result of the election gives gratifying assurance\r\nto our country and to its friends throughout the world that a government\r\nbased on the free consent of an intelligent and patriotic people possesses\r\nelements of strength, stability, and permanency not found in any other form\r\nof government.\r\n\r\nContinued opposition to the full and free enjoyment of the rights of\r\ncitizenship conferred upon the colored people by the recent amendments to\r\nthe Constitution still prevails in several of the late slaveholding States.\r\nIt has, perhaps, not been manifested in the recent election to any large\r\nextent in acts of violence or intimidation. It has, however, by fraudulent\r\npractices in connection with the ballots, with the regulations as to the\r\nplaces and manner of voting, and with counting, returning, and canvassing\r\nthe votes cast, been successful in defeating the exercise of the right\r\npreservative of all rights--the right of suffrage--which the Constitution\r\nexpressly confers upon our enfranchised citizens.\r\n\r\nIt is the desire of the good people of the whole country that sectionalism\r\nas a factor in our politics should disappear. They prefer that no section\r\nof the country should be united in solid opposition to any other section.\r\nThe disposition to refuse a prompt and hearty obedience to the equal-rights\r\namendments to the Constitution is all that now stands in the way of a\r\ncomplete obliteration of sectional lines in our political contests. As long\r\nas either of these amendments is flagrantly violated or disregarded, it is\r\nsafe to assume that the people who placed them in the Constitution, as\r\nembodying the legitimate results of the war for the Union, and who believe\r\nthem to be wise and necessary, will continue to act together and to insist\r\nthat they shall be obeyed. The paramount question still is as to the\r\nenjoyment of the fight by every American citizen who has the requisite\r\nqualifications to freely cast his vote and to have it honestly counted.\r\nWith this question rightly settled, the country will be relieved of the\r\ncontentions of the past; bygones will indeed be bygones, and political and\r\nparty issues, with respect to economy and efficiency of administration,\r\ninternal improvements, the tariff, domestic taxation, education, finance,\r\nand other important subjects, will then receive their full share of\r\nattention; but resistance to and nullification of the results of the war\r\nwill unite together in resolute purpose for their support all who maintain\r\nthe authority of the Government and the perpetuity of the Union, and who\r\nadequately appreciate the value of the victory achieved. This determination\r\nproceeds from no hostile sentiment or feeling to any part of the people of\r\nour country or to any of their interests. The inviolability of the\r\namendments rests upon the fundamental principle of our Government. They are\r\nthe solemn expression of the will of the people of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe sentiment that the constitutional rights of all our citizens must be\r\nmaintained does not grow weaker. It will continue to control the Government\r\nof the country. Happily, the history of the late election shows that in\r\nmany parts of the country where opposition to the fifteenth amendment has\r\nheretofore prevailed it is diminishing, and is likely to cease altogether\r\nif firm and well-considered action is taken by Congress. I trust the House\r\nof Representatives and the Senate, which have the right to judge of the\r\nelections, returns, and qualifications of their own members, will see to it\r\nthat every case of violation of the letter or spirit of the fifteenth\r\namendment is thoroughly investigated, and that no benefit from such\r\nviolation shall accrue to any person or party. It will be the duty of the\r\nExecutive, with sufficient appropriations for the purpose, to prosecute\r\nunsparingly all who have been engaged in depriving citizens of the rights\r\nguaranteed to them by the Constitution.\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, to be forgotten that the best and surest guaranty of\r\nthe primary rights of citizenship is to be found in that capacity for\r\nself-protection which can belong only to a people whose right to universal\r\nsuffrage is supported by universal education. The means at the command of\r\nthe local and State authorities are in many cases wholly inadequate to\r\nfurnish free instruction to all who need it. This is especially true where\r\nbefore emancipation the education of the people was neglected or prevented,\r\nin the interest of slavery. Firmly convinced that the subject of popular\r\neducation deserves the earnest attention of the people of the whole\r\ncountry, with a view to wise and comprehensive action by the Government of\r\nthe United States, I respectfully recommend that Congress, by suitable\r\nlegislation and with proper safeguards, supplement the local educational\r\nfunds in the several States where the grave duties and responsibilities of\r\ncitizenship have been devolved on uneducated people by devoting to the\r\npurpose grants of the public lands and, if necessary, by appropriations\r\nfrom the Treasury of the United States. Whatever Government can fairly do\r\nto promote free popular education ought to be done. Wherever general\r\neducation is found, peace, virtue, and social order prevail and civil and\r\nreligious liberty are secure.\r\n\r\nIn my former annual messages I have asked the attention of Congress to the\r\nurgent necessity of a reformation of the civil-service system of the\r\nGovernment. My views concerning the dangers of patronage, or appointments\r\nfor personal or partisan considerations, have been strengthened by my\r\nobservation and experience in the Executive office, and I believe these\r\ndangers threaten the stability of the Government. Abuses so serious in\r\ntheir nature can not be permanently tolerated. They tend to become more\r\nalarming with the enlargement of administrative service, as the growth of\r\nthe country in population increases the number of officers and placemen\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nThe reasons are imperative for the adoption of fixed rules for the\r\nregulation of appointments, promotions, and removals, establishing a\r\nuniform method having exclusively in view in every instance the attainment\r\nof the best qualifications for the position in question. Such a method\r\nalone is consistent with the equal rights of all citizens and the most\r\neconomical and efficient administration of the public business.\r\n\r\nCompetitive examinations in aid of impartial appointments and promotions\r\nhave been conducted for some years past in several of the Executive\r\nDepartments, and by my direction this system has been adopted in the\r\ncustom-houses and post-offices of the larger cities of the country. In the\r\ncity of New York over 2,000 positions in the civil service have been\r\nsubject in their appointments and tenure of place to the operation of\r\npublished rules for this purpose during the past two years. The results of\r\nthese practical trials have been very satisfactory, and have confirmed my\r\nopinion in favor of this system of selection. All are subjected to the same\r\ntests, and the result is free from prejudice by personal favor or partisan\r\ninfluence. It secures for the position applied for the best qualifications\r\nattainable among the competing applicants. It is an effectual protection\r\nfrom the pressure of importunity, which under any other course pursued\r\nlargely exacts the time and attention of appointing officers, to their\r\ngreat detriment in the discharge of other official duties preventing the\r\nabuse of the service for the mere furtherance of private or party purposes,\r\nand leaving the employee of the Government, freed from the obligations\r\nimposed by patronage, to depend solely upon merit for retention and\r\nadvancement, and with this constant incentive to exertion and improvement.\r\n\r\nThese invaluable results have been attained in a high degree in the offices\r\nwhere the rules for appointment by competitive examination have been\r\napplied.\r\n\r\nA method which has so approved itself by experimental tests at points where\r\nsuch tests may be fairly considered conclusive should be extended to all\r\nsubordinate positions under the Government. I believe that a strong and\r\ngrowing public sentiment demands immediate measures for securing and\r\nenforcing the highest possible efficiency in the civil service and its\r\nprotection from recognized abuses, and that the experience referred to has\r\ndemonstrated the feasibility of such measures.\r\n\r\nThe examinations in the custom-houses and post-offices have been held under\r\nmany embarrassments and without provision for compensation for the extra\r\nlabor performed by the officers who have conducted them, and whose\r\ncommendable interest in the improvement of the public service has induced\r\nthis devotion of time and labor without pecuniary reward. A continuance of\r\nthese labors gratuitously ought not to be expected, and without an\r\nappropriation by Congress for compensation it is not practicable to extend\r\nthe system of examinations generally throughout the civil service. It is\r\nalso highly important that all such examinations should be conducted upon a\r\nuniform system and under general supervision. Section 1753 of the Revised\r\nStatutes authorizes the President to prescribe the regulations for\r\nadmission to the civil service of the United States, and for this purpose\r\nto employ suitable persons to conduct the requisite inquiries with\r\nreference to \"the fitness of each candidate, in respect to age, health,\r\ncharacter, knowledge, and ability for the branch of service into which he\r\nseeks to enter;\" but the law is practically inoperative for want of the\r\nrequisite appropriation.\r\n\r\nI therefore recommend an appropriation of $25,000 per annum to meet the\r\nexpenses of a commission, to be appointed by the President in accordance\r\nwith the terms of this section, whose duty it shall be to devise a just,\r\nuniform, and efficient system of competitive examinations and to supervise\r\nthe application of the same throughout the entire civil service of the\r\nGovernment. I am persuaded that the facilities which such a commission will\r\nafford for testing the fitness of those who apply for office will not only\r\nbe as welcome a relief to members of Congress as it will be to the\r\nPresident and heads of Departments, but that it will also greatly tend to\r\nremove the causes of embarrassment which now inevitably and constantly\r\nattend the conflicting claims of patronage between the legislative and\r\nexecutive departments. The most effectual check upon the pernicious\r\ncompetition of influence and official favoritism in the bestowal of office\r\nwill be the substitution of an open competition of merit between the\r\napplicants, in which everyone can make his own record with the assurance\r\nthat his success will depend upon this alone.\r\n\r\nI also recommend such legislation as, while leaving every officer as free\r\nas any other citizen to express his political opinions and to use his means\r\nfor their advancement, shall also enable him to feel as safe as any private\r\ncitizen in refusing all demands upon his salary for political purposes. A\r\nlaw which should thus guarantee true liberty and justice to all who are\r\nengaged in the public service, and likewise contain stringent provisions\r\nagainst the use of official authority to coerce the political action of\r\nprivate citizens or of official subordinates, is greatly to be desired.\r\n\r\nThe most serious obstacle, however, to an improvement of the civil service,\r\nand especially to a reform in the method of appointment and removal, has\r\nbeen found to be the practice, under what is known as the spoils system, by\r\nwhich the appointing power has been so largely encroached upon by members\r\nof Congress. The first step in the reform of the civil service must be a\r\ncomplete divorce between Congress and the Executive in the matter of\r\nappointments. The corrupting doctrine that \"to the victors belong the\r\nspoils\" is inseparable from Congressional patronage as the established rule\r\nand practice of parties in power. It comes to be understood by applicants\r\nfor office and by the people generally that Representatives and Senators\r\nare entitled to disburse the patronage of their respective districts and\r\nStates. It is not necessary to recite at length the evils resulting from\r\nthis invasion of the Executive functions. The true principles of Government\r\non the subject of appointments to office, as stated in the national\r\nconventions of the leading parties of the country, have again and again\r\nbeen approved by the American people, and have not been called in question\r\nin any quarter. These authentic expressions of public opinion upon this\r\nall-important subject are the statement of principles that belong to the\r\nconstitutional structure of the Government. Under the Constitution the\r\nPresident and heads of Departments are to make nominations for office. The\r\nSenate is to advise and consent to appointments, and the House of\r\nRepresentatives is to accuse and prosecute faithless officers. The best\r\ninterest of the public service demands that these distinctions be\r\nrespected; that Senators and Representatives, who may be judges and\r\naccusers, should not dictate appointments to office. To this end the\r\ncooperation of the legislative department of the Government is required\r\nalike by the necessities of the case and by public opinion. Members of\r\nCongress will not be relieved from the demands made upon them with\r\nreference to appointments to office until by legislative enactment the\r\npernicious practice is condemned and forbidden.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore recommended that an act be passed defining the relations of\r\nmembers of Congress with respect to appointment to office by the President;\r\nand I also recommend that the provisions of section 1767 and of the\r\nsections following of the Revised Statutes, comprising the tenure-of-office\r\nact of March 2, 1867, be repealed.\r\n\r\nBelieving that to reform the system and methods of the civil service in our\r\ncountry is one of the highest and most imperative duties of statesmanship,\r\nand that it can be permanently done only by the cooperation of the\r\nlegislative and executive departments of the Government, I again commend\r\nthe whole subject to your considerate attention.\r\n\r\nIt is the recognized duty and purpose of the people of the United States to\r\nsuppress polygamy where it now exists in our Territories and to prevent its\r\nextension. Faithful and zealous efforts have been made by the United States\r\nauthorities in Utah to enforce the laws against it. Experience has shown\r\nthat the legislation upon this subject, to be effective, requires extensive\r\nmodification and amendment. The longer action is delayed the more difficult\r\nit will be to accomplish what is desired. Prompt and decided measures are\r\nnecessary. The Mormon sectarian organization which upholds polygamy has the\r\nwhole power of making and executing the local legislation of the Territory.\r\nBy its control of the grand and petit juries it possesses large influence\r\nover the administration of justice. Exercising, as the heads of this sect\r\ndo, the local political power of the Territory, they are able to make\r\neffective their hostility to the law of Congress on the subject of\r\npolygamy, and, in fact, do prevent its enforcement. Polygamy will not be\r\nabolished if the enforcement of the law depends on those who practice and\r\nuphold the crime. It can only be suppressed by taking away the political\r\npower of the sect which encourages and sustains it.\r\n\r\nThe power of Congress to enact suitable laws to protect the Territories is\r\nample. It is not a case for halfway measures. The political power of the\r\nMormon sect is increasing. It controls now one of our wealthiest and most\r\npopulous Territories. It is extending steadily into other Territories.\r\nWherever it goes it establishes polygamy and sectarian political power. The\r\nsanctity of marriage and the family relation are the corner stone of our\r\nAmerican society and civilization. Religious liberty and the separation of\r\nchurch and state are among the elementary ideas of free institutions. To\r\nreestablish the interests and principles which polygamy and Mormonism have\r\nimperiled, and to fully reopen to intelligent and virtuous immigrants of\r\nall creeds that part of our domain which has been in a great degree closed\r\nto general immigration by intolerant and immoral institutions, it is\r\nrecommended that the government of the Territory of Utah be reorganized.\r\n\r\nI recommend that Congress provide for the government of Utah by a governor\r\nand judges, or commissioners, appointed by the President and confirmed by\r\nthe Senate--a government analogous to the provisional government\r\nestablished for the territory northwest of the Ohio by the ordinance of\r\n1787. If, however, it is deemed best to continue the existing form of local\r\ngovernment, I recommend that the right to vote, hold office, and sit on\r\njuries in the Territory of Utah be confined to those who neither practice\r\nnor uphold polygamy. If thorough measures are adopted, it is believed that\r\nwithin a few years the evils which now afflict Utah will be eradicated, and\r\nthat this Territory will in good time become one of the most prosperous and\r\nattractive of the new States of the Union.\r\n\r\nOur relations with all foreign countries have been those of undisturbed\r\npeace, and have presented no occasion for concern as to their continued\r\nmaintenance.\r\n\r\nMy anticipation of an early reply from the British Government to the demand\r\nof indemnity to our fishermen for the injuries suffered by that industry at\r\nFortune Bay in January, 1878, which I expressed in my last annual message,\r\nwas disappointed. This answer was received only in the latter part of April\r\nin the present year, and when received exhibited a failure of accord\r\nbetween the two Governments as to the measure of the inshore fishing\r\nprivilege secured to our fishermen by the treaty of Washington of so\r\nserious a character that I made it the subject of a communication to\r\nCongress, in which I recommended the adoption of the measures which seemed\r\nto me proper to be taken by this Government in maintenance of the rights\r\naccorded to our fishermen under the treaty and toward securing an indemnity\r\nfor the injury these interests had suffered. A bill to carry out these\r\nrecommendations was under consideration by the House of Representatives at\r\nthe time of the adjournment of Congress in June last.\r\n\r\nWithin a few weeks I have received a communication from Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment renewing the consideration of the subject, both of the indemnity\r\nfor the injuries at Fortune Bay and of the interpretation of the treaty in\r\nwhich the previous correspondence had shown the two Governments to be at\r\nvariance. Upon both these topics the disposition toward a friendly\r\nagreement is manifested by a recognition of our right to an indemnity for\r\nthe transaction at Fortune Bay, leaving the measure of such indemnity to\r\nfurther conference, and by an assent to the view of this Government,\r\npresented in the previous correspondence, that the regulation of\r\nconflicting interests of the shore fishery of the provincial seacoasts and\r\nthe vessel fishery of our fishermen should be made the subject of\r\nconference and concurrent arrangement between the two Governments.\r\n\r\nI sincerely hope that the basis may be found for a speedy adjustment of the\r\nvery serious divergence of views in the interpretation of the fishery\r\nclauses of the treaty of Washington, which, as the correspondence between\r\nthe two Governments stood at the close of the last session of Congress,\r\nseemed to be irreconcilable.\r\n\r\nIn the important exhibition of arts and industries which was held last year\r\nat Sydney, New South Wales, as well as in that now in progress at\r\nMelbourne, the United States have been efficiently and honorably\r\nrepresented. The exhibitors from this country at the former place received\r\na large number of awards in some of the most considerable departments, and\r\nthe participation of the United States was recognized by a special mark of\r\ndistinction. In the exhibition at Melbourne the share taken by our country\r\nis no less notable, and an equal degree of success is confidently\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\nThe state of peace and tranquillity now enjoyed by all the nations of the\r\ncontinent of Europe has its favorable influence upon our diplomatic and\r\ncommercial relations with them. We have concluded and ratified a convention\r\nwith the French Republic for the settlement of claims of the citizens of\r\neither country against the other. Under this convention a commission,\r\npresided over by a distinguished publicist, appointed in pursuance of the\r\nrequest of both nations by His Majesty the Emperor of Brazil, has been\r\norganized and has begun its sessions in this city. A congress to consider\r\nmeans for the protection of industrial property has recently been in\r\nsession in Paris, to which I have appointed the ministers of the United\r\nStates in France and in Belgium as delegates. The International Commission\r\nupon Weights and Measures also continues its work in Paris. I invite your\r\nattention to the necessity of an appropriation to be made in time to enable\r\nthis Government to comply with its obligations under the metrical\r\nconvention.\r\n\r\nOur friendly relations with the German Empire continue without\r\ninterruption. At the recent International Exhibition of Fish and Fisheries\r\nat Berlin the participation of the United States, notwithstanding the haste\r\nwith which the commission was forced to make its preparations, was\r\nextremely successful and meritorious, winning for private exhibitors\r\nnumerous awards of a high class and for the country at large the principal\r\nprize of honor offered by His Majesty the Emperor. The results of this\r\ngreat success can not but be advantageous to this important and growing\r\nindustry. There have been some questions raised between the two Governments\r\nas to the proper effect and interpretation of our treaties of\r\nnaturalization, but recent dispatches from our minister at Berlin show that\r\nfavorable progress is making toward an understanding in accordance with the\r\nviews of this Government, which makes and admits no distinction whatever\r\nbetween the rights of a native and a naturalized citizen of the United\r\nStates. In practice the complaints of molestation suffered by naturalized\r\ncitizens abroad have never been fewer than at present.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing of importance to note in our unbroken friendly relations\r\nwith the Governments of Austria-Hungary, Russia, Portugal, Sweden and\r\nNorway, Switzerland, Turkey, and Greece.\r\n\r\nDuring the last summer several vessels belonging to the merchant marine of\r\nthis country, sailing in neutral waters of the West Indies, were fired at,\r\nboarded, and searched by an armed cruiser of the Spanish Government. The\r\ncircumstances as reported involve not only a private injury to the persons\r\nconcerned, but also seemed too little observant of the friendly relations\r\nexisting for a century between this country and Spain. The wrong was\r\nbrought to the attention of the Spanish Government in a serious protest and\r\nremonstrance, and the matter is undergoing investigation by the royal\r\nauthorities with a view to such explanation or reparation as may be called\r\nfor by the facts.\r\n\r\nThe commission sitting in this city for the adjudication of claims of our\r\ncitizens against the Government of Spain is, I hope, approaching the\r\ntermination of its labors.\r\n\r\nThe claims against the United States under the Florida treaty with Spain\r\nwere submitted to Congress for its action at the late session, and I again\r\ninvite your attention to this long-standing question, with a view to a\r\nfinal disposition of the matter.\r\n\r\nAt the invitation of the Spanish Government, a conference has recently been\r\nheld at the city of Madrid to consider the subject of protection by foreign\r\npowers of native Moors in the Empire of Morocco. The minister of the United\r\nStates in Spain was directed to take part in the deliberations of this\r\nconference, the result of which is a convention signed on behalf of all the\r\npowers represented. The instrument will be laid before the Senate for its\r\nconsideration. The Government of the United States has also lost no\r\nopportunity to urge upon that of the Emperor of Morocco the necessity, in\r\naccordance with the humane and enlightened spirit of the age, of putting an\r\nend to the persecutions, which have been so prevalent in that country, of\r\npersons of a faith other than the Moslem, and especially of the Hebrew\r\nresidents of Morocco.\r\n\r\nThe consular treaty concluded with Belgium has not yet been officially\r\npromulgated, owing to the alteration of a word in the text by the Senate of\r\nthe United States, which occasioned a delay, during which the time allowed\r\nfor ratification expired. The Senate will be asked to extend the period for\r\nratification.\r\n\r\nThe attempt to negotiate a treaty of extradition with Denmark failed on\r\naccount of the objection of the Danish Government to the usual clause\r\nproviding that each nation should pay the expense of the arrest of the\r\npersons whose extradition it asks.\r\n\r\nThe provision made by Congress at its last session for the expense of the\r\ncommission which had been appointed to enter upon negotiations with the\r\nImperial Government of China on subjects of great interest to the relations\r\nof the two countries enabled the commissioners to proceed at once upon\r\ntheir mission. The Imperial Government was prepared to give prompt and\r\nrespectful attention to the matters brought under negotiation, and the\r\nconferences proceeded with such rapidity and success that on the 17th of\r\nNovember last two treaties were signed at Peking, one relating to the\r\nintroduction of Chinese into this country and one relating to commerce. Mr.\r\nTrescot, one of the commissioners, is now on his way home bringing the\r\ntreaties, and it is expected that they will be received in season to be\r\nlaid before the Senate early in January.\r\n\r\nOur minister in Japan has negotiated a convention for the reciprocal relief\r\nof shipwrecked seamen. I take occasion to urge once more upon Congress the\r\npropriety of making provision for the erection of suitable fireproof\r\nbuildings at the Japanese capital for the use of the American legation and\r\nthe court-house and jail connected with it. The Japanese Government, with\r\ngreat generosity and courtesy, has offered for this purpose an eligible\r\npiece of land.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message I invited the attention of Congress to the\r\nsubject of the indemnity funds received some years ago from China and\r\nJapan. I renew the recommendation then made that whatever portions of these\r\nfunds are due to American citizens should be promptly paid and the residue\r\nreturned to the nations, respectively, to which they justly and equitably\r\nbelong.\r\n\r\nThe extradition treaty with the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Which has been\r\nfor some time in course of negotiation, has during the past year been\r\nconcluded and duly ratified.\r\n\r\nRelations of friendship and amity have been established between the\r\nGovernment of the United States and that of Roumania. We have sent a\r\ndiplomatic representative to Bucharest, and have received at this capital\r\nthe special envoy who has been charged by His Royal Highness Prince Charles\r\nto announce the independent sovereignty of Roumania. We hope for a speedy\r\ndevelopment of commercial relations between the two countries.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message I expressed the hope that the prevalence of quiet\r\non the border between this country and Mexico would soon become so assured\r\nas to justify the modification of the orders then in force to our military\r\ncommanders in regard to crossing the frontier, without encouraging such\r\ndisturbances as would endanger the peace of the two countries. Events moved\r\nin accordance with these expectations, and the orders were accordingly\r\nwithdrawn, to the entire satisfaction of our own citizens and the Mexican\r\nGovernment. Subsequently the peace of the border was again disturbed by a\r\nsavage foray under the command of the Chief Victoria, but by the combined\r\nand harmonious action of the military forces of both countries his band has\r\nbeen broken up and substantially destroyed.\r\n\r\nThere is reason to believe that the obstacles which have so long prevented\r\nrapid and convenient communication between the United States and Mexico by\r\nrailways are on the point of disappearing, and that several important\r\nenterprises of this character will soon be set on foot, which can not fail\r\nto contribute largely to the prosperity of both countries.\r\n\r\nNew envoys from Guatemala, Colombia, Bolivia, Venezuela, and Nicaragua have\r\nrecently arrived at this capital, whose distinction and enlightenment\r\nafford the best guaranty of the continuance of friendly relations between\r\nourselves and these sister Republics.\r\n\r\nThe relations between this Government and that of the United States of\r\nColombia have engaged public attention during the past year, mainly by\r\nreason of the project of an interoceanic canal across the Isthmus of\r\nPanama, to be built by private capital under a concession from the\r\nColombian Government for that purpose. The treaty obligations subsisting\r\nbetween the United States and Colombia, by which we guarantee the\r\nneutrality of the transit and the sovereignty and property of Colombia in\r\nthe Isthmus, make it necessary that the conditions under which so\r\nstupendous a change in the region embraced in this guaranty should be\r\neffected--transforming, as it would, this Isthmus from a barrier between\r\nthe Atlantic and Pacific oceans into a gateway and thoroughfare between\r\nthem for the navies and the merchant ships of the world--should receive the\r\napproval of this Government, as being compatible with the discharge of\r\nthese obligations on our part and consistent with our interests as the\r\nprincipal commercial power of the Western Hemisphere. The views which I\r\nexpressed in a special message to Congress in March last in relation to\r\nthis project I deem it my duty again to press upon your attention.\r\nSubsequent consideration has but confirmed the opinion \"that it is the\r\nright and duty of the United States to assert and maintain such supervision\r\nand authority over any interoceanic canal across the isthmus that connects\r\nNorth and South America as will protect our national interest.\"\r\n\r\nThe war between the Republic of Chile on the one hand and the allied\r\nRepublics of Peru and Bolivia on the other still continues. This Government\r\nhas not felt called upon to interfere in a contest that is within the\r\nbelligerent rights of the parties as independent states. We have, however,\r\nalways held ourselves in readiness to aid in accommodating their\r\ndifference, and have at different times reminded both belligerents of our\r\nwillingness to render such service.\r\n\r\nOur good offices in this direction were recently accepted by all the\r\nbelligerents, and it was hoped they would prove efficacious; but I regret\r\nto announce that the measures which the ministers of the United States at\r\nSantiago and Lima were authorized to take with the view to bring about a\r\npeace were not successful. In the course of the war some questions have\r\narisen affecting neutral rights. In all of these the ministers of the\r\nUnited States have, under their instructions, acted with promptness and\r\nenergy in protection of American interests.\r\n\r\nThe relations of the United States with the Empire of Brazil continue to be\r\nmost cordial, and their commercial intercourse steadily increases, to their\r\nmutual advantage.\r\n\r\nThe internal disorders with which the Argentine Republic has for some time\r\npast been afflicted, and which have more or less influenced its external\r\ntrade, are understood to have been brought to a close. This happy result\r\nmay be expected to redound to the benefit of the foreign commerce of that\r\nRepublic, as well as to the development of its vast interior resources.\r\n\r\nIn Samoa the Government of King Malietoa, under the support and recognition\r\nof the consular representatives of the United States, Great Britain, and\r\nGermany, seems to have given peace and tranquillity to the islands. While\r\nit does not appear desirable to adopt as a whole the scheme of tripartite\r\nlocal government which has been proposed, the common interests of the three\r\ngreat treaty powers require harmony in their relations to the native frame\r\nof government, and this may be best secured by a simple diplomatic\r\nagreement between them. It would be well if the consular jurisdiction of\r\nour representative at Apia were increased in extent and importance so as to\r\nguard American interests in the surrounding and outlying islands of\r\nOceanica.\r\n\r\nThe obelisk generously presented by the Khedive of Egypt to the city of New\r\nYork has safely arrived in this country, and will soon be erected in that\r\nmetropolis. A commission for the liquidation of the Egyptian debt has\r\nlately concluded its work, and this Government, at the earnest solicitation\r\nof the Khedive, has acceded to the provisions adopted by it, which will be\r\nlaid before Congress for its information. A commission for the revision of\r\nthe judicial code of the reform tribunal of Egypt is now in session in\r\nCairo. Mr. Farman, consul-general, and J. M. Batchelder, esq., have been\r\nappointed as commissioners to participate in this work. The organization of\r\nthe reform tribunals will probably be continued for another period of five\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the act passed at the last session of Congress, invitations\r\nhave been extended to foreign maritime states to join in a sanitary\r\nconference in Washington, beginning the 1st of January. The acceptance of\r\nthis invitation by many prominent powers gives promise of success in this\r\nimportant measure, designed to establish a system of international\r\nnotification by which the spread of infectious or epidemic diseases may be\r\nmore effectively checked or prevented. The attention of Congress is invited\r\nto the necessary appropriations for carrying into effect the provisions of\r\nthe act referred to.\r\n\r\nThe efforts of the Department of State to enlarge the trade and commerce of\r\nthe United States, through the active agency of consular officers and\r\nthrough the dissemination of information obtained from them, have been\r\nunrelaxed. The interest in these efforts, as developed in our commercial\r\ncommunities, and the value of the information secured by this means to the\r\ntrade and manufactures of the country were recognized by Congress at its\r\nlast session, and provision was made for the more frequent publication of\r\nconsular and other reports by the Department of State. The first issue of\r\nthis publication has now been prepared, and subsequent issues may regularly\r\nbe expected. The importance and interest attached to the reports of\r\nconsular officers are witnessed by the general demand for them by all\r\nclasses of merchants and manufacturers engaged in our foreign trade. It is\r\nbelieved that the system of such publications is deserving of the approval\r\nof Congress, and that the necessary appropriations for its continuance and\r\nenlargement will commend itself to your consideration.\r\n\r\nThe prosperous energies of our domestic industries and their immense\r\nproduction of the subjects of foreign commerce invite, and even require, an\r\nactive development of the wishes and interests of our people in that\r\ndirection. Especially important is it that our commercial relations with\r\nthe Atlantic and Pacific coasts of South America, with the West Indies and\r\nthe Gulf of Mexico, should be direct, and not through the circuit of\r\nEuropean systems, and should be carried on in our own bottoms. The full\r\nappreciation of the opportunities which our front on the Pacific Ocean\r\ngives to commerce with Japan, China, and the East Indies, with Australia\r\nand the island groups which lie along these routes of navigation, should\r\ninspire equal efforts to appropriate to our own shipping and to administer\r\nby our own capital a due proportion of this trade. Whatever modifications\r\nof our regulations of trade and navigation may be necessary or useful to\r\nmeet and direct these impulses to the enlargement of our exchanges and of\r\nour carrying trade I am sure the wisdom of Congress will be ready to\r\nsupply. One initial measure, however, seems to me so dearly useful and\r\nefficient that I venture to press it upon your earnest attention. It seems\r\nto be very evident that the provision of regular steam postal communication\r\nby aid from government has been the forerunner of the commercial\r\npredominance of Great Britain on all these coasts and seas, a greater share\r\nin whose trade is now the desire and the intent of our people. It is also\r\nmanifest that the efforts of other European nations to contend with Great\r\nBritain for a share of this commerce have been successful in proportion\r\nwith their adoption of regular steam postal communication with the markets\r\nwhose trade they sought. Mexico and the States of South America are anxious\r\nto receive such postal communication with this country and to aid in their\r\ndevelopment. Similar cooperation may be looked for in due time from the\r\nEastern nations and from Australia. It is difficult to see how the lead in\r\nthis movement can be expected from private interests. In respect of foreign\r\ncommerce quite as much as in internal trade postal communication seems\r\nnecessarily a matter of common and public administration, and thus\r\npertaining to Government. I respectfully recommend to your prompt attention\r\nsuch just and efficient measures as may conduce to the development of our\r\nforeign commercial exchanges and the building up of our carrying trade.\r\n\r\nIn this connection I desire also to suggest the very great service which\r\nmight be expected in enlarging and facilitating our commerce on the Pacific\r\nOcean were a transmarine cable laid from San Francisco to the Sandwich\r\nIslands, and thence to Japan at the north and Australia at the south. The\r\ngreat influence of such means of communication on these routes of\r\nnavigation in developing and securing the due share of our Pacific Coast in\r\nthe commerce of the world needs no illustration or enforcement. It may be\r\nthat such an enterprise, useful, and in the end profitable, as it would\r\nprove to private investment, may need to be accelerated by prudent\r\nlegislation by Congress in its aid, and I submit the matter to your careful\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nAn additional and not unimportant, although secondary, reason for fostering\r\nand enlarging the Navy may be found in the unquestionable service to the\r\nexpansion of our commerce which would be rendered by the frequent\r\ncirculation of naval ships in the seas and ports of all quarters of the\r\nglobe. Ships of the proper construction and equipment to be of the greatest\r\nefficiency in case of maritime war might be made constant and active agents\r\nin time of peace in the advancement and protection of our foreign trade and\r\nin the nurture and discipline of young seamen, who would naturally in some\r\nnumbers mix with and improve the crews of our merchant ships. Our merchants\r\nat home and abroad recognize the value to foreign commerce of an active\r\nmovement of our naval vessels, and the intelligence and patriotic zeal of\r\nour naval officers in promoting every interest of their countrymen is a\r\njust subject of national pride.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the financial affairs of the Government, as shown by the\r\nreport of the Secretary of the Treasury, is very satisfactory. It is\r\nbelieved that the present financial situation of the United States, whether\r\nconsidered with respect to trade, currency, credit, growing wealth, or the\r\nextent and variety of our resources, is more favorable than that of any\r\nother country of our time, and has never been surpassed by that of any\r\ncountry at any period of its history. All our industries are thriving; the\r\nrate of interest is low; new railroads are being constructed; a vast\r\nimmigration is increasing our population, capital, and labor; new\r\nenterprises in great number are in progress, and our commercial relations\r\nwith other countries are improving.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary revenues from all sources for the fiscal year ended June 30,\r\n1880, were--\r\n\r\nFrom customs - $186,522,064.60\r\n\r\nFrom internal revenue - 124,009,373.92\r\n\r\nFrom sales of public lands - 1,016,506.60\r\n\r\nFrom tax on circulation and deposits of national banks - 7,014,971.44\r\n\r\nFrom repayment of interest by Pacific Railway companies - 1,707,367.18\r\n\r\nFrom sinking fund for Pacific Railway companies - 786,621.22\r\n\r\nFrom customs fees, fines, penalties, etc - 1,148,800.16\r\n\r\nFrom fees-consular, letters patent, and lands - 2,337,029.00\r\n\r\nFrom proceeds of sales of Government property - 282,616.50\r\n\r\nFrom profits on coinage, etc - 2,792,186.78\r\n\r\nFrom revenues of the District of Columbia - 1,809,469.70\r\n\r\nFrom miscellaneous sources - 4,099,603.88",
