Deeply moved by the expression of confidence and personal\r\nattachment which has called me to this service, I am sure my gratitude\r\ncan make no better return than the pledge I now give before God and\r\nthese witnesses of unreserved and complete devotion to the interests\r\nand welfare of those who have honored me.\r\n\r\nI deem it fitting on this occasion, while indicating the opinions I hold\r\nconcerning public questions of present importance, to also briefly refer\r\nto the existence of certain conditions and tendencies among our people\r\nwhich seem to menace the integrity and usefulness of their Government.\r\n\r\nWhile every American citizen must contemplate with the utmost pride and\r\nenthusiasm the growth and expansion of our country, the sufficiency of\r\nour institutions to stand against the rudest shocks of violence, the\r\nwonderful thrift and enterprise of our people, and the demonstrated\r\nsuperiority of our free government, it behooves us to constantly watch\r\nfor every symptom of insidious infirmity that threatens our national\r\nvigor.\r\n\r\nThe strong man who in the confidence of sturdy health courts the\r\nsternest activities of life and rejoices in the hardihood of constant\r\nlabor may still have lurking near his vitals the unheeded disease that\r\ndooms him to sudden collapse.\r\n\r\nIt can not be doubted that our stupendous achievements as a people and\r\nour country's robust strength have given rise to heedlessness of those\r\nlaws governing our national health which we can no more evade than human\r\nlife can escape the laws of God and nature.\r\n\r\nManifestly nothing is more vital to our supremacy as a nation and to the\r\nbeneficent purposes of our Government than a sound and stable currency.\r\nIts exposure to degradation should at once arouse to activity the most\r\nenlightened statesmanship, and the danger of depreciation in the\r\npurchasing power of the wages paid to toil should furnish the strongest\r\nincentive to prompt and conservative precaution.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with our present embarrassing situation as related to this\r\nsubject we will be wise if we temper our confidence and faith in our\r\nnational strength and resources with the frank concession that even\r\nthese will not permit us to defy with impunity the inexorable laws\r\nof finance and trade. At the same time, in our efforts to adjust\r\ndifferences of opinion we should be free from intolerance or passion,\r\nand our judgments should be unmoved by alluring phrases and unvexed\r\nby selfish interests.\r\n\r\nI am confident that such an approach to the subject will result in\r\nprudent and effective remedial legislation. In the meantime, so far as\r\nthe executive branch of the Government can intervene, none of the powers\r\nwith which it is invested will be withheld when their exercise is deemed\r\nnecessary to maintain our national credit or avert financial disaster.\r\n\r\nClosely related to the exaggerated confidence in our country's greatness\r\nwhich tends to a disregard of the rules of national safety, another\r\ndanger confronts us not less serious. I refer to the prevalence of a\r\npopular disposition to expect from the operation of the Government\r\nespecial and direct individual advantages.\r\n\r\nThe verdict of our voters which condemned the injustice of maintaining\r\nprotection for protection's sake enjoins upon the people's servants the\r\nduty of exposing and destroying the brood of kindred evils which are\r\nthe unwholesome progeny of paternalism. This is the bane of republican\r\ninstitutions and the constant peril of our government by the people.\r\nIt degrades to the purposes of wily craft the plan of rule our fathers\r\nestablished and bequeathed to us as an object of our love and\r\nveneration. It perverts the patriotic sentiments of our countrymen and\r\ntempts them to pitiful calculation of the sordid gain to be derived\r\nfrom their Government's maintenance. It undermines the self-reliance of\r\nour people and substitutes in its place dependence upon governmental\r\nfavoritism. It stifles the spirit of true Americanism and stupefies\r\nevery ennobling trait of American citizenship.\r\n\r\nThe lessons of paternalism ought to be unlearned and the better lesson\r\ntaught that while the people should patriotically and cheerfully support\r\ntheir Government its functions do not include the support of the people.\r\n\r\nThe acceptance of this principle leads to a refusal of bounties and\r\nsubsidies, which burden the labor and thrift of a portion of our\r\ncitizens to aid ill-advised or languishing enterprises in which they\r\nhave no concern. It leads also to a challenge of wild and reckless\r\npension expenditure, which overleaps the bounds of grateful recognition\r\nof patriotic service and prostitutes to vicious uses the people's prompt\r\nand generous impulse to aid those disabled in their country's defense.\r\n\r\nEvery thoughtful American must realize the importance of checking at its\r\nbeginning any tendency in public or private station to regard frugality\r\nand economy as virtues which we may safely outgrow. The toleration of\r\nthis idea results in the waste of the people's money by their chosen\r\nservants and encourages prodigality and extravagance in the home life\r\nof our countrymen.\r\n\r\nUnder our scheme of government the waste of public money is a crime\r\nagainst the citizen, and the contempt of our people for economy and\r\nfrugality in their personal affairs deplorably saps the strength and\r\nsturdiness of our national character.\r\n\r\nIt is a plain dictate of honesty and good government that public\r\nexpenditures should be limited by public necessity, and that this should\r\nbe measured by the rules of strict economy; and it is equally clear that\r\nfrugality among the people is the best guaranty of a contented and\r\nstrong support of free institutions.\r\n\r\nOne mode of the misappropriation of public funds is avoided when\r\nappointments to office, instead of being the rewards of partisan\r\nactivity, are awarded to those whose efficiency promises a fair return\r\nof work for the compensation paid to them. To secure the fitness and\r\ncompetency of appointees to office and remove from political action the\r\ndemoralizing madness for spoils, civil-service reform has found a place\r\nin our public policy and laws. The benefits already gained through this\r\ninstrumentality and the further usefulness it promises entitle it to the\r\nhearty support and encouragement of all who desire to see our public\r\nservice well performed or who hope for the elevation of political\r\nsentiment and the purification of political methods.\r\n\r\nThe existence of immense aggregations of kindred enterprises and\r\ncombinations of business interests formed for the purpose of limiting\r\nproduction and fixing prices is inconsistent with the fair field which\r\nought to be open to every independent activity. Legitimate strife in\r\nbusiness should not be superseded by an enforced concession to the\r\ndemands of combinations that have the power to destroy, nor should the\r\npeople to be served lose the benefit of cheapness which usually results\r\nfrom wholesome competition. These aggregations and combinations\r\nfrequently constitute conspiracies against the interests of the people,\r\nand in all their phases they are unnatural and opposed to our American\r\nsense of fairness. To the extent that they can be reached and restrained\r\nby Federal power the General Government should relieve our citizens from\r\ntheir interference and exactions.\r\n\r\nLoyalty to the principles upon which our Government rests positively\r\ndemands that the equality before the law which it guarantees to every\r\ncitizen should be justly and in good faith conceded in all parts of the\r\nland. The enjoyment of this right follows the badge of citizenship\r\nwherever found, and, unimpaired by race or color, it appeals for\r\nrecognition to American manliness and fairness.\r\n\r\nOur relations with the Indians located within our border impose upon us\r\nresponsibilities we can not escape. Humanity and consistency require us\r\nto treat them with forbearance and in our dealings with them to honestly\r\nand considerately regard their rights and interests. Every effort should\r\nbe made to lead them, through the paths of civilization and education,\r\nto self-supporting and independent citizenship. In the meantime, as the\r\nnation's wards, they should be promptly defended against the cupidity of\r\ndesigning men and shielded from every influence or temptation that\r\nretards their advancement.\r\n\r\nThe people of the United States have decreed that on this day the\r\ncontrol of their Government in its legislative and executive branches\r\nshall be given to a political party pledged in the most positive terms\r\nto the accomplishment of tariff reform. They have thus determined in\r\nfavor of a more just and equitable system of Federal taxation. The\r\nagents they have chosen to carry out their purposes are bound by their\r\npromises not less than by the command of their masters to devote\r\nthemselves unremittingly to this service.\r\n\r\nWhile there should be no surrender of principle, our task must be\r\nundertaken wisely and without heedless vindictiveness. Our mission is\r\nnot punishment, but the rectification of wrong. If in lifting burdens\r\nfrom the daily life of our people we reduce inordinate and unequal\r\nadvantages too long enjoyed, this is but a necessary incident of\r\nour return to right and justice. If we exact from unwilling minds\r\nacquiescence in the theory of an honest distribution of the fund of the\r\ngovernmental beneficence treasured up for all, we but insist upon a\r\nprinciple which underlies our free institutions. When we tear aside the\r\ndelusions and misconceptions which have blinded our countrymen to their\r\ncondition under vicious tariff laws, we but show them how far they have\r\nbeen led away from the paths of contentment and prosperity. When we\r\nproclaim that the necessity for revenue to support the Government\r\nfurnishes the only justification for taxing the people, we announce\r\na truth so plain that its denial would seem to indicate the extent to\r\nwhich judgment may be influenced by familiarity with perversions of the\r\ntaxing power. And when we seek to reinstate the self-confidence and\r\nbusiness enterprise of our citizens by discrediting an abject dependence\r\nupon governmental favor, we strive to stimulate those elements of\r\nAmerican character which support the hope of American achievement.\r\n\r\nAnxiety for the redemption of the pledges which my party has made and\r\nsolicitude for the complete justification of the trust the people have\r\nreposed in us constrain me to remind those with whom I am to cooperate\r\nthat we can succeed in doing the work which has been especially set\r\nbefore us only by the most sincere, harmonious, and disinterested\r\neffort. Even if insuperable obstacles and opposition prevent the\r\nconsummation of our task, we shall hardly be excused; and if failure can\r\nbe traced to our fault or neglect we may be sure the people will hold us\r\nto a swift and exacting accountability.\r\n\r\nThe oath I now take to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of\r\nthe United States not only impressively defines the great responsibility\r\nI assume, but suggests obedience to constitutional commands as the rule\r\nby which my official conduct must be guided. I shall to the best of my\r\nability and within my sphere of duty preserve the Constitution by loyally\r\nprotecting every grant of Federal power it contains, by defending all\r\nits restraints when attacked by impatience and restlessness, and by\r\nenforcing its limitations and reservations in favor of the States and\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nFully impressed with the gravity of the duties that confront me and\r\nmindful of my weakness, I should be appalled if it were my lot to bear\r\nunaided the responsibilities which await me. I am, however, saved from\r\ndiscouragement when I remember that I shall have the support and the\r\ncounsel and cooperation of wise and patriotic men who will stand at my\r\nside in Cabinet places or will represent the people in their legislative\r\nhalls.\r\n\r\nI find also much comfort in remembering that my countrymen are just and\r\ngenerous and in the assurance that they will not condemn those who by\r\nsincere devotion to their service deserve their forbearance and\r\napproval.\r\n\r\nAbove all, I know there is a Supreme Being who rules the affairs of men\r\nand whose goodness and mercy have always followed the American people,\r\nand I know He will not turn from us now if we humbly and reverently seek\r\nHis powerful aid.\r\n\r\nMARCH 4, 1893.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, March 9, 1893_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report submitted by the Secretary of State in\r\ncompliance with the resolution of the Senate of the 3d instant, calling\r\nfor information relating to the capture and imprisonment of Captain\r\nPharos B.

That section 1956 of the Revised Statutes of the United States\r\n  is hereby declared to include and apply to all the dominion of the\r\n  United States in the waters of Bering Sea; and it shall be the duty of\r\n  the President at a timely season in each year to issue his proclamation,\r\n  and cause the same to be published for one month in at least one\r\n  newspaper (if any such there be) published at each United States port of\r\n  entry on the Pacific coast, warning all persons against entering said\r\n  waters for the purpose of violating the provisions of said section;\r\n  and he shall also cause one or more vessels of the United States to\r\n  diligently cruise said waters and arrest all persons and seize all\r\n  vessels found to be or to have been engaged in any violation of the\r\n  laws of the United States therein.\r\n\r\nArticles I, II, and III of a convention between the United States of\r\nAmerica and Great Britain for the renewal of the existing _modus\r\nvivendi_ in Bering Sea, concluded April 18, 1892, are published for\r\nthe same purpose:\r\n\r\n  ARTICLE I. Her Majesty's Government will prohibit during the pendency of\r\n  the arbitration seal killing in that part of Bering Sea lying eastward\r\n  of the line of demarcation described in Article No. I of the treaty of\r\n  1867 between the United States and Russia, and will promptly use its\r\n  best efforts to insure the observance of this prohibition by British\r\n  subjects and vessels.\r\n\r\n  ART. II. The United States Government will prohibit seal killing for the\r\n  same period in the same part of Bering Sea and on the shores and islands\r\n  thereof the property of the United States (in excess of 7,500 to be\r\n  taken on the islands for the subsistence of the natives), and will\r\n  promptly use its best efforts to insure the observance of this\r\n  prohibition by United States citizens and vessels.\r\n\r\n  ART. III.

With plenteous crops, with abundant promise of remunerative\r\nproduction and manufacture, with unusual invitation to safe investment,\r\nand with satisfactory assurance to business enterprise, suddenly\r\nfinancial distrust and fear have sprung up on every side. Numerous\r\nmoneyed institutions have suspended because abundant assets were not\r\nimmediately available to meet the demands of frightened depositors.\r\nSurviving corporations and individuals are content to keep in hand the\r\nmoney they are usually anxious to loan, and those engaged in legitimate\r\nbusiness are surprised to find that the securities they offer for loans,\r\nthough heretofore satisfactory, are no longer accepted. Values supposed\r\nto be fixed are fast becoming conjectural, and loss and failure have\r\ninvaded every branch of business.\r\n\r\nI believe these things are principally chargeable to Congressional\r\nlegislation touching the purchase and coinage of silver by the General\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nThis legislation is embodied in a statute passed on the 14th day of\r\nJuly, 1890, which was the culmination of much agitation on the subject\r\ninvolved, and which may be considered a truce, after a long struggle,\r\nbetween the advocates of free silver coinage and those intending to be\r\nmore conservative.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly the monthly purchases by the Government of 4,500,000\r\nounces of silver, enforced under that statute, were regarded by those\r\ninterested in silver production as a certain guaranty of its increase in\r\nprice. The result, however, has been entirely different, for immediately\r\nfollowing a spasmodic and slight rise the price of silver began to fall\r\nafter the passage of the act, and has since reached the lowest point\r\never known. This disappointing result has led to renewed and persistent\r\neffort in the direction of free silver coinage.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile not only are the evil effects of the operation of the present\r\nlaw constantly accumulating, but the result to which its execution must\r\ninevitably lead is becoming palpable to all who give the least heed to\r\nfinancial subjects.\r\n\r\nThis law provides that in payment for the 4,500,000 ounces of silver\r\nbullion which the Secretary of the Treasury is commanded to purchase\r\nmonthly there shall be issued Treasury notes redeemable on demand in\r\ngold or silver coin, at the discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury,\r\nand that said notes may be reissued. It is, however, declared in the act\r\nto be \"the established policy of the United States to maintain the two\r\nmetals on a parity with each other upon the present legal ratio or such\r\nratio as may be provided by law.\" This declaration so controls the\r\naction of the Secretary of the Treasury as to prevent his exercising the\r\ndiscretion nominally vested in him if by such action the parity between\r\ngold and silver may be disturbed. Manifestly a refusal by the Secretary\r\nto pay these Treasury notes in gold if demanded would necessarily result\r\nin their discredit and depreciation as obligations payable only in\r\nsilver, and would destroy the parity between the two metals by\r\nestablishing a discrimination in favor of gold.\r\n\r\nUp to the 15th day of July, 1893, these notes had been issued in payment\r\nof silver-bullion purchases to the amount of more than $147,000,000.\r\nWhile all but a very small quantity of this bullion remains uncoined and\r\nwithout usefulness in the Treasury, many of the notes given in its\r\npurchase have been paid in gold. This is illustrated by the statement\r\nthat between the 1st day of May, 1892, and the 15th day of July, 1893,\r\nthe notes of this kind issued in payment for silver bullion amounted to\r\na little more than $54,000,000, and that during the same period about\r\n$49,000,000 were paid by the Treasury in gold for the redemption of such\r\nnotes.\r\n\r\nThe policy necessarily adopted of paying these notes in gold has not\r\nspared the gold reserve of $100,000,000 long ago set aside by the\r\nGovernment for the redemption of other notes, for this fund has already\r\nbeen subjected to the payment of new obligations amounting to about\r\n$150,000,000 on account of silver purchases, and has as a consequence\r\nfor the first time since its creation been encroached upon.\r\n\r\nWe have thus made the depletion of our gold easy and have tempted other\r\nand more appreciative nations to add it to their stock. That the\r\nopportunity we have offered has not been neglected is shown by the large\r\namounts of gold which have been recently drawn from our Treasury and\r\nexported to increase the financial strength of foreign nations. The\r\nexcess of exports of gold over its imports for the year ending June 30,\r\n1893, amounted to more than $87,500,000.\r\n\r\nBetween the 1st day of July, 1890, and the 15th day of July, 1893, the\r\ngold coin and bullion in our Treasury decreased more than $132,000,000,\r\nwhile during the same period the silver coin and bullion in the Treasury\r\nincreased more than $147,000,000. Unless Government bonds are to be\r\nconstantly issued and sold to replenish our exhausted gold, only to be\r\nagain exhausted, it is apparent that the operation of the\r\nsilver-purchase law now in force leads in the direction of the entire\r\nsubstitution of silver for the gold in the Government Treasury, and that\r\nthis must be followed by the payment of all Government obligations in\r\ndepreciated silver.\r\n\r\nAt this stage gold and silver must part company and the Government must\r\nfail in its established policy to maintain the two metals on a parity\r\nwith each other. Given over to the exclusive use of a currency greatly\r\ndepreciated according to the standard of the commercial world, we could\r\nno longer claim a place among nations of the first class, nor could our\r\nGovernment claim a performance of its obligation, so far as such an\r\nobligation has been imposed upon it, to provide for the use of the\r\npeople the best and safest money.\r\n\r\nIf, as many of its friends claim, silver ought to occupy a larger\r\nplace in our currency and the currency of the world through general\r\ninternational cooperation and agreement, it is obvious that the United\r\nStates will not be in a position to gain a hearing in favor of such an\r\narrangement so long as we are willing to continue our attempt to\r\naccomplish the result single-handed.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge in business circles among our own people that our\r\nGovernment can not make its fiat equivalent to intrinsic value nor keep\r\ninferior money on a parity with superior money by its own independent\r\nefforts has resulted in such a lack of confidence at home in the\r\nstability of currency values that capital refuses its aid to new\r\nenterprises, while millions are actually withdrawn from the channels of\r\ntrade and commerce to become idle and unproductive in the hands of timid\r\nowners. Foreign investors, equally alert, not only decline to purchase\r\nAmerican securities, but make haste to sacrifice those which they\r\nalready have.\r\n\r\nIt does not meet the situation to say that apprehension in regard to the\r\nfuture of our finances is groundless and that there is no reason for\r\nlack of confidence in the purposes or power of the Government in the\r\npremises. The very existence of this apprehension and lack of\r\nconfidence, however caused, is a menace which ought not for a moment to\r\nbe disregarded. Possibly, if the undertaking we have in hand were the\r\nmaintenance of a specific known quantity of silver at a parity with\r\ngold, our ability to do so might be estimated and gauged, and perhaps,\r\nin view of our unparalleled growth and resources, might be favorably\r\npassed upon. But when our avowed endeavor is to maintain such parity in\r\nregard to an amount of silver increasing at the rate of $50,000,000\r\nyearly, with no fixed termination to such increase, it can hardly be\r\nsaid that a problem is presented whose solution is free from doubt.\r\n\r\nThe people of the United States are entitled to a sound and stable\r\ncurrency and to money recognized as such on every exchange and in every\r\nmarket of the world. Their Government has no right to injure them by\r\nfinancial experiments opposed to the policy and practice of other\r\ncivilized states, nor is it justified in permitting an exaggerated and\r\nunreasonable reliance on our national strength and ability to jeopardize\r\nthe soundness of the people's money.\r\n\r\nThis matter rises above the plane of party politics. It vitally concerns\r\nevery business and calling and enters every household in the land. There\r\nis one important aspect of the subject which especially should never be\r\noverlooked. At times like the present, when the evils of unsound finance\r\nthreaten us, the speculator may anticipate a harvest gathered from the\r\nmisfortune of others, the capitalist may protect himself by hoarding or\r\nmay even find profit in the fluctuations of values; but the wage\r\nearner--the first to be injured by a depreciated currency and the last\r\nto receive the benefit of its correction--is practically defenseless. He\r\nrelies for work upon the ventures of confident and contented capital.\r\nThis failing him, his condition is without alleviation, for he can\r\nneither prey on the misfortunes of others nor hoard his labor. One of\r\nthe greatest statesmen our country has known, speaking more than fifty\r\nyears ago, when a derangement of the currency had caused commercial\r\ndistress, said:\r\n\r\n  The very man of all others who has the deepest interest in a sound\r\n  currency and who suffers most by mischievous legislation in money\r\n  matters is the man who earns his daily bread by his daily toil.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese words are as pertinent now as on the day they were uttered, and\r\nought to impressively remind us that a failure in the discharge of our\r\nduty at this time must especially injure those of our countrymen who\r\nlabor, and who because of their number and condition are entitled to the\r\nmost watchful care of their Government.\r\n\r\nIt is of the utmost importance that such relief as Congress can afford\r\nin the existing situation be afforded at once. The maxim \"He gives twice\r\nwho gives quickly\" is directly applicable. It may be true that the\r\nembarrassments from which the business of the country is suffering\r\narise as much from evils apprehended as from those actually existing.\r\nWe may hope, too, that calm counsels will prevail, and that neither the\r\ncapitalists nor the wage earners will give way to unreasoning panic\r\nand sacrifice their property or their interests under the influence of\r\nexaggerated fears. Nevertheless, every day's delay in removing one of\r\nthe plain and principal causes of the present state of things enlarges\r\nthe mischief already done and increases the responsibility of the\r\nGovernment for its existence. Whatever else the people have a right\r\nto expect from Congress, they may certainly demand that legislation\r\ncondemned by the ordeal of three years' disastrous experience shall be\r\nremoved from the statute books as soon as their representatives can\r\nlegitimately deal with it.\r\n\r\nIt was my purpose to summon Congress in special session-early in the\r\ncoming September, that we might enter promptly upon the work of tariff\r\nreform, which the true interests of the country clearly demand, which so\r\nlarge a majority of the people, as shown by their suffrages, desire and\r\nexpect, and to the accomplishment of which every effort of the present\r\nAdministration is pledged. But while tariff reform has lost nothing of\r\nits immediate and permanent importance and must in the near future\r\nengage the attention of Congress, it has seemed to me that the financial\r\ncondition of the country should at once and before all other subjects be\r\nconsidered by your honorable body.\r\n\r\nI earnestly recommend the prompt repeal of the provisions of the act\r\npassed July 14, 1890, authorizing the purchase of silver bullion, and\r\nthat other legislative action may put beyond all doubt or mistake the\r\nintention and the ability of the Government to fulfill its pecuniary\r\nobligations in money universally recognized by all civilized countries.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, October 18, 1893_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn response to the resolution of the Senate of the 10th instant,\r\nconcerning the attitude of the Government of China with regard to an\r\nextension of the time for the registration of Chinese laborers in the\r\nUnited States under the act of May 5, 1892, I transmit a report of the\r\nSecretary of State on the subject.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas, pursuant to section 10 of the act of Congress approved March 3,\r\n1893, entitled \"An act making appropriations for current and contingent\r\nexpenses and fulfilling treaty stipulations with Indian tribes for\r\nfiscal year ending June 30, 1894,\" the Cherokee Nation of Indians, by a\r\nwritten agreement made on the 17th day of May, 1893, has ratified the\r\nagreement for the cession of certain lands hereinafter described, as\r\namended by said act of March 3, 1893, and thereby ceded, conveyed,\r\ntransferred, relinquished, and surrendered all its title, claim, and\r\ninterest of every kind and character in and to that part of the Indian\r\nTerritory bounded on the west by the one hundredth degree (100 degree)\r\nof west longitude, on the north by the State of Kansas, on the east by\r\nthe ninety-sixth degree (96 degree) of west longitude, and on the south\r\nby the Creek Nation, the Territory of Oklahoma, and the Cheyenne and\r\nArapahoe Reservation created or defined by Executive order dated August\r\n10, 1869: _Provided_, That any citizen of the Cherokee Nation who\r\nprior to the 1st day of November, 1891, was a _bona fide_ resident\r\nupon and, further, had, as a farmer and for farming purposes, made\r\npermanent and valuable improvements upon any part of the land so ceded,\r\nand who has not disposed of the same, but desires to occupy the\r\nparticular lands so improved as a homestead and for farming purposes,\r\nshall have the right to select one-eighth of a section of land, to\r\nconform, however, to the United States surveys; such selection to\r\nembrace, as far as the above limitation will admit, such improvements;\r\nthe wife and children of any such citizen shall have the same right of\r\nselection that is above given to the citizen, and they shall have the\r\npreference in making selections to take any lands improved by the\r\nhusband and father that he can not take until all of his improved land\r\nshall be taken; and that any citizen of the Cherokee Nation not a\r\nresident within the land so ceded who prior to the 1st day of November,\r\n1891, had for farming purposes made valuable and permanent improvements\r\nupon any of the land so ceded shall have the right to select one-eighth\r\nof a section of land, to conform to the United States surveys; such\r\nselection to embrace, as far as the above limitation will admit, such\r\nimprovements; but the allotments so provided for shall not exceed\r\nseventy (70) in number and the land allotted shall not exceed five\r\nthousand and six hundred (5,600) acres; and such allotments shall be\r\nmade and confirmed under such rules and regulations as shall be\r\nprescribed by the Secretary of the Interior, and when so made and\r\nconfirmed shall be conveyed to the allottees respectively by the United\r\nStates in fee simple; and from the price to be paid to the Cherokee\r\nNation for the cession so made there shall be deducted the sum of one\r\ndollar and forty cents ($1.40) for each acre so taken in allotment:\r\n_And provided_, That D.W.

Such occupancy shall not be regarded as\r\ntrespass or in violation of this proclamation or of the law under which\r\nit is made, nor shall any settlement rights be gained thereby.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner of the General Land Office shall, under the direction\r\nof the Secretary of the Interior, establish on said 100-foot strip\r\nbooths, to be located as follows: One in township 29 north, range 2\r\neast; one in township 29 north, range 2 west; one in township 29 north,\r\nrange 4 west; one in township 29 north, range 8 west; one in township 29\r\nnorth, range 12 west; one in township 20 north, range 3 east; one in\r\ntownship 20 north, range 2 west; one in township 20 north, range 7 west;\r\nand one in township 20 north, range 26 west; and shall place in charge\r\nthereof three officers to each booth, who shall be detailed from the\r\nGeneral Land Office. Said booths shall be open for the transaction of\r\nbusiness on and after Monday, the 11th day of the month of September,\r\nA.D. 1893, from 7 a.m. to 12 m. and 1 p.m. to 6 p.m. each business day\r\nuntil the same shall be discontinued by the Secretary of the Interior,\r\nwho is hereby authorized to discontinue the same at his discretion. Each\r\nparty desiring to enter upon and occupy as a homestead any of the lands\r\nhereby opened to settlement will be required to first appear at one of\r\nthe before-mentioned booths and make a declaration in writing, to be\r\nsigned by the party in the presence of one of the officers in charge\r\nthereof, which shall be certified by such officer, according to the form\r\nhereto attached and made a part hereof marked A, showing his or her\r\nqualifications to make homestead entry for said lands, whereupon a\r\ncertificate will be issued by the officers in charge of the booth to the\r\nparty making the declaration, which shall be of the form hereto attached\r\nand made a part hereof marked D.\r\n\r\nWhere a party desires to file a soldier's declaratory statement in\r\nperson, he will be required to make a declaration which shall be of the\r\nform hereto attached and made a part hereof marked B, the same to be\r\nmade and subscribed before one of the officers in charge of the booth\r\nand certified by such officer, independently of the affidavit (Form\r\n4-546) to be filed when he presents the certificate of Form D, there\r\ngiven him, to the district officers. Where a party desires to file a\r\ndeclaratory statement through an agent, it will be necessary for him\r\npreviously to make the affidavit ordinarily required (Form 4-545) before\r\nsome officer authorized to administer oaths and place the same in the\r\nhands of the agent, who, before being permitted to enter upon the lands\r\nto be opened in said outlet for the purpose of making the desired\r\nfiling, will be required to appear before the officers in charge of\r\nsome one of the booths, to present the said affidavit of the party\r\nauthorizing him to act as such agent, and to make a declaration in\r\nwriting, to be subscribed by him in the presence of one of such\r\nofficers, which shall be certified by such officer, according to the\r\nform hereto attached and made a part hereof marked C, whereupon a\r\ncertificate of Form D will be given him by said officer. The agent\r\nshould be provided with affidavits of Form 4-545 made in duplicate--one\r\nfor presentation to the officers in charge of the booth and the other\r\nfor presentation to the district officers when formal filing is to be\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nEach party desiring to enter upon said lands for the purpose of settling\r\nupon a town lot will be required to first appear at one of the\r\nbefore-mentioned booths and make a declaration in writing, to be signed\r\nby the party in the presence of one of the officers in charge thereof,\r\nwhich shall be certified by such officer, according to the form hereto\r\nattached and made a part hereof marked E, whereupon a certificate will\r\nbe issued by the officers in charge of the booth to the party making the\r\ndeclaration, which shall be of the form hereto attached and made a part\r\nhereof marked F.\r\n\r\nThe said declarations made before the officers in charge shall be given\r\nconsecutive numbers, beginning at No. 1 at each booth, and the\r\ncertificate issued to the party making the declaration shall be given\r\nthe same number as is given the declaration. The declaration shall be\r\ncarefully preserved by the officers in charge of the booths, and when\r\nthe booths are discontinued said declarations shall be transmitted,\r\ntogether with the duplicate affidavits (Form 4-545) hereinbefore\r\nrequired to be presented in case of agents proposing to act for soldiers\r\nin filing declaratory statements, to the General Land Office for filing\r\nas a part of the records pertaining to the disposal of said lands.\r\n\r\nThe certificate will be evidence only that the party named therein\r\nis permitted to go in upon the lands opened to settlement by this\r\nproclamation at the time specified herein, and the certificate of Form D\r\nmust be surrendered when application to enter or file is presented to\r\nthe district officers, and the party's right to make a filing, homestead\r\nentry, or settlement shall be passed upon by the district land officers\r\nat the proper time and in the usual manner. The holder of such\r\ncertificate will be required when he makes his homestead affidavit, or,\r\nif a soldier or soldier's agent, when he files a declaratory statement\r\nat the district office, to allege under oath before the officers taking\r\nsuch homestead affidavit or to whom said declaratory statement is\r\npresented for filing that all the statements contained in the\r\ndeclaration made by him, upon which said certificate is based, are true\r\nin every particular, such oath to be added to affidavit of Form 4-102,\r\nas shown on form hereto attached and made a part hereof marked 102_d_.\r\n\r\nAfter the hour and day hereinbefore named when said lands will be\r\nopened to settlement all parties holding such certificates (Form D or F)\r\nwill be permitted to occupy or enter upon the lands so opened, and\r\nparties holding a certificate of Form D may initiate a homestead claim,\r\neither by settlement upon the land or by entry or filing at the proper\r\ndistrict office; but no person not holding any such certificate shall be\r\npermitted to occupy or enter upon any of said lands until after the\r\nbooths shall have been discontinued by direction of the Secretary of the\r\nInterior. Until then the officers of the United States are expressly\r\ncharged to permit no party without a certificate to occupy or enter upon\r\nany of said lands.\r\n\r\nThe following rules and regulations have been prescribed by the\r\nSecretary of the Interior, under the direction of the President, as\r\nprovided by section 10 of said act of March 3, 1893, for the occupation\r\nand settlement of the lands hereby opened, to wit:\r\n\r\nThe thirteenth section of the act approved March 2, 1889, the act\r\napproved May 2, 1890, the second proviso of section 17 and the whole of\r\nsection 18 of the act approved March 3, 1891, are by section 10 of the\r\nact of March 3, 1893, made applicable in disposing of the lands under\r\nsaid section 10, and said lands are thereby rendered subject to disposal\r\nunder the homestead and town-site laws only, with certain modifications,\r\nwhich laws as so modified contain provisions substantially as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Any party will be entitled to initiate a homestead claim to a tract\r\nof said lands who is over 21 years of age or the head of a family; who\r\nis a citizen of the United States or has declared his intention to\r\nbecome such; who has not exhausted his homestead right either by\r\nperfecting a homestead entry for 160 acres of land under any law,\r\nexcepting what is known as the commuted provision of the homestead law\r\ncontained in section 2301 of the United States Revised Statutes, or by\r\nmaking or commuting a homestead entry since March 2, 1889; who has not\r\nentered since August 30, 1890, under the land laws of the United States\r\nor filed upon a quantity of land agricultural in character and not\r\nmineral which with the tracts sought to be entered in any case would\r\nmake more than 320 acres; who is not the owner in fee simple of 160\r\nacres of land in any State or Territory, and who has not entered upon or\r\noccupied the lands hereby opened in violation of this the President's\r\nproclamation opening the same to settlement and entry. (See section\r\n2289, U.S. Revised Statutes; act of March 2, 1889, 25 U.S. Statutes at\r\nLarge, p. 854; section 13 of the act of March 2, 1889, 25 U.S. Statutes\r\nat Large, p. 1005; act of August 30, 1890, 26 U.S. Statutes at Large, p.\r\n391; section 20, act of May 2, 1890, 26 U.S. Statutes at Large, p. 91,\r\nand section 10, act of March 3, 1893, 27 U.S. Statutes at Large, p.\r\n640.)\r\n\r\n2. Each entry shall be in a compact body, according to the rectangular\r\nsubdivisions of the public surveys, and in a square form, as nearly as\r\nreasonably practicable consistently with such surveys; and no person\r\nshall be permitted to enter more than one quarter section in quantity of\r\nsaid lands. (See section 13, act of March 2, 1889, 25 U.S. Statutes at\r\nLarge, p. 1005.)\r\n\r\n3. Parties who own and reside upon land (not acquired by them under the\r\nhomestead law) not amounting in quantity to a quarter section may, if\r\notherwise qualified, enter other land lying contiguous to their own to\r\nan amount which shall not with the land already owned by them exceed in\r\nthe aggregate 160 acres. (See section 2289, U.S. Revised Statutes.)\r\n\r\n4. Any party who has made a homestead entry prior to March 2, 1889, for\r\nless than one quarter section of land and who still owns and occupies\r\nthe land so entered may, if otherwise qualified, enter an additional\r\ntract of land lying contiguous to the land embraced in the original\r\nentry, which shall not with the land first entered exceed in the\r\naggregate 160 acres; but such additional entry will not be permitted, or\r\nif permitted will be canceled, if the original entry should fail for any\r\nreason prior to patent or should appear to be illegal or fraudulent. The\r\nfinal proof of residence and cultivation made on the original entry,\r\ntogether with the payment of the prescribed price for the land, will be\r\nsufficient to entitle the party to a final certificate for the land so\r\nentered without further proof. (See section 5 of the act of March 2,\r\n1889, 25 U.S. Statutes at Large, p. 854.)\r\n\r\n5. Parties who have complied with the conditions of the law with regard\r\nto a homestead entry for less than 160 acres of land made prior to March\r\n2, 1889, and have had the final papers issued therefor, may, if\r\notherwise qualified, make an additional entry, by legal subdivisions, of\r\nso much land as added to the quantity previously so entered shall not\r\nexceed 160 acres. Parties making entry under the provisions set forth in\r\nthis paragraph will be required to reside upon and cultivate the land\r\nembraced therein for the prescribed period and to submit proof of\r\nresidence and cultivation of a like character with that required in\r\nordinary homestead entries before the issuance of a final certificate.\r\n(See section 6, act of March 2, 1889, 25 U.S. Statutes at Large, p.\r\n854.)\r\n\r\n6. Any officer, soldier, seaman, or marine who served for not less than\r\nninety days in the Army or Navy of the United States during the War of\r\nthe Rebellion and who was honorably discharged and has remained loyal to\r\nthe Government, or, in case of his death, his widow, or, in case of her\r\ndeath or remarriage, his minor orphan children, by a guardian duly\r\nappointed and officially accredited at the Department of the Interior,\r\nmay, either in person or by agent, file a declaratory statement for a\r\ntract of land and have six months thereafter within which to make actual\r\nentry and commence residence and improvements upon the land. (See\r\nsections 2304, 2307, and 2309, U.S. Revised Statutes.)\r\n\r\n7. Every person entitled under the preceding paragraph to enter a\r\nhomestead who, or whose deceased husband or father, in case of the widow\r\nor minor children, may have prior to June 22, 1874, entered under the\r\nhomestead laws a quantity of land less than 160 acres may, if otherwise\r\nqualified, enter so much land as when added to the quantity previously\r\nentered shall not exceed 160 acres; but the party must make affidavit\r\nthat the entry is made for actual settlement and cultivation, and the\r\nproof of such settlement and cultivation prescribed by existing\r\nhomestead laws and regulations thereunder will be required to be\r\nproduced before the issue of final certificate. (See section 2306, U.S.\r\nRevised Statutes, and section 18 of the act of May 2, 1890, 26 U.S.\r\nStatutes at Large, p. 90.)\r\n\r\n8. Parties may initiate claims under the homestead law either by\r\nsettlement on the land or by entry at the district office. In the former\r\ncase the party will have three months after settlement within which to\r\nfile his application for the tract at the district office; in the latter\r\ncase the party will have six months after entry at that office within\r\nwhich to establish residence and begin improvements upon the land. (See\r\nsections 2290 and 2297, U.S. Revised Statutes, and section 3 of the act\r\nof May 14, 1880, 21 U.S. Statutes at Large, p. 140.)\r\n\r\n9. The homestead affidavits required to be filed with the application\r\nmust be executed before the register or receiver of the proper district\r\nland office (see section 2290, U.S. Revised Statutes) or before any\r\nother officer who may be found duly qualified at the time to administer\r\nsuch oaths, according to the provisions of the act of Congress of May\r\n26, 1890 (26 U.S. Statutes at Large, p. 121).\r\n\r\n10. Parties applying to make homestead entry will be required to tender\r\nwith the application the legal fee and commissions, which are as\r\nfollows: For an entry of over 80 acres a fee of $10, and for an entry of\r\n80 acres or less a fee of $5, and in both cases, in addition,\r\ncommissions of 2 per cent upon the Government price of the land,\r\ncomputed at the rate of $1.25 per acre, the ordinary minimum price of\r\npublic lands under the general provisions of section 2357, United States\r\nRevised Statutes. (See sections 2238 and 2290, U.S. Revised Statutes.)\r\n\r\n11. Homestead applicants appearing in great number at the local office\r\nto make entry at the time of opening will be required to form in line,\r\nin order that their applications may be presented and acted upon in\r\nregular order.\r\n\r\n12. Soldiers' declaratory statements can only be made by the parties\r\nentitled or by their agents in person, and will not be received if sent\r\nby mail. A party acting as agent and appearing in line, as contemplated\r\nunder the eleventh paragraph, will be allowed to make one entry or\r\nfiling in his individual character, if he so desires, and to file one\r\ndeclaratory statement in his representative character as agent, if such\r\nhe shall be, and thereupon he will be required to step out of line,\r\ngiving place to the next person in order, and, if he desires to make any\r\nother filings, to take his place at the end of the line and await his\r\nproper turn before doing so, and thus to proceed in order until all the\r\nfilings desired by him shall be made.\r\n\r\n13. Section 2301 of the Revised Statutes of the United States, providing\r\nfor commutation of homestead entries, is not applicable to said lands.\r\n(See section 18 of the act of May 2, 1890, 26 U.S. Statutes at Large, p.\r\n90.)\r\n\r\n14. Proof of five years' residence, cultivation, and improvement and the\r\npayment prescribed by the statute, as hereinbefore mentioned, must be\r\nmade before a party will be entitled to a patent under the homestead\r\nlaw, and such proof is required to be made within seven years from the\r\ndate of the entry. Commissions equal to 2 per cent upon the Government\r\nprice for the land, computed at $1.25 per acre, under section 2357,\r\nUnited States Revised Statutes, must also be tendered with the final\r\nproof. Interest at 4 per cent per annum on the purchase price of the\r\nland must be paid from the date of the entry to date of final payment of\r\npurchase money. (See sections 2238 and 2291, U.S. Revised Statutes, and\r\nsections 10 and 13 of the act of March 3, 1893, 27 U.S. Statutes at\r\nLarge, p. 640.)\r\n\r\n15. The parties named in paragraph 6 of these regulations are entitled\r\nto have the term of service in the Army or Navy under which the claim is\r\nmade, not exceeding four years, deducted from the period of five years'\r\nresidence or cultivation required as stated in the preceding paragraph,\r\nor, if the party was discharged from service on account of wounds or\r\ndisabilities incurred in the line of duty, the whole term of enlistment,\r\nnot exceeding four years, may be deducted. (See section 2305, U.S.\r\nRevised Statutes.)\r\n\r\n16. Where a homestead settler dies before the consummation of his claim,\r\nthe widow, or, in case of her death, the heirs or devisee, may continue\r\nsettlement or cultivation and obtain title upon requisite proof at the\r\nproper time. If the widow proves up, title will pass to her; if she dies\r\nbefore proving up and the heirs or devisee make the proof, the title\r\nwill vest in them, respectively. (See section 2291, U.S. Revised\r\nStatutes.)\r\n\r\n17. Where both parents die, leaving infant children, the homestead may\r\nbe sold for cash for the benefit of such children, and the purchaser\r\nwill receive title from the United States. (See section 2292, U.S.\r\nRevised Statutes.)\r\n\r\n18. In case of the death of a person after having entered a homestead\r\nthe failure of the widow, children, or devisee of the deceased to\r\nfulfill the demands of the letter of the law as to residence on the\r\nlands will not necessarily subject the entry to forfeiture on the ground\r\nof abandonment. If the land is cultivated in good faith, the law will be\r\nconsidered as having been substantially complied with.\r\n\r\n19. Town-site claims maybe initiated upon said lands under the statutes\r\nby two methods, which are separate and distinct in character. The\r\nregulations under the first method are hereinafter set forth in\r\nparagraphs 20, 21, and 22, and under the second method in paragraphs 23\r\nto 28, inclusive. Provision is further made for town-site entries in\r\ncases where lands entered under the homestead law are required for\r\ntown-site purposes, as set forth in paragraph 30.\r\n\r\n20. Parties having founded or who desire to found a city or town on the\r\npublic lands must file with the recorder of the county in which land is\r\nsituate a plat thereof, describing the exterior boundaries of the land\r\naccording to the lines of public surveys. Such plat must state the name\r\nof the city or town, exhibit the streets, squares, blocks, lots, and\r\nalleys, and specify the size of the same, with measurements and area of\r\neach municipal subdivision the lots in which shall not exceed 4,200\r\nsquare feet, with a statement of the extent and general character of the\r\nimprovements. The plat and statement must be verified by the oath of the\r\nparty, acting for and in behalf of the occupants and inhabitants of the\r\ntown or city. Within one month after filing the plat with the recorder\r\nof the county a verified copy of said plat and statement must be sent to\r\nthe General Land Office, accompanied by the testimony of two witnesses\r\nthat such town or city has been established in good faith, and a similar\r\nmap and statement must be filed with the register and receiver of the\r\nproper district office. Thereafter the President may cause the lots\r\nembraced within the limits of such city or town to be offered at public\r\nsale to the highest bidder, subject to a minimum of $10 for each lot;\r\nand such lots as may not be disposed of at public sale shall thereafter\r\nbe liable to private entry at such minimum or at such reasonable\r\nincrease or diminution thereafter as the Secretary of the Interior may\r\norder from time to time, after at least three months' notice, in view\r\nof the increase or decrease in the value of the municipal property. Any\r\nactual settler upon any lot and upon any additional lot upon which he\r\nmay have substantial improvements shall be entitled to prove up and\r\npurchase the same as a preemption, at such minimum, at any time before\r\nthe day fixed for the public sale. (See section 2382, U.S. Revised\r\nStatutes.)\r\n\r\n21. In case the parties interested shall fail or refuse within twelve\r\nmonths after founding a city or town to file in the General Land Office\r\na transcript map, with the statement and testimony, as required in\r\nparagraph 20, the Secretary of the Interior may cause a survey and plat\r\nto be made of said city or town, and thereafter the lots will be sold at\r\nan increase of 50 per cent on the minimum price of $10 per lot. (See\r\nsection 2384, U.S. Revised Statutes.)\r\n\r\n22. When lots vary in size from the limitation of 4,200 square feet and\r\nthe lots, buildings, and improvements cover an area greater than 640\r\nacres, such variance as to size of lots or excess in area will prove no\r\nbar to entry, but the price of the lots may be increased to such\r\nreasonable amount as the Secretary of the Interior may by rule\r\nestablish. (See section 2385, U.S. Revised Statutes.)\r\n\r\n23. Under the second method lands actually settled upon and occupied as\r\na town site, and therefore not subject to entry under the homestead\r\nlaws, may be entered as a town site at the proper district land office.\r\n(See section 2387, U.S. Revised Statutes.)\r\n\r\n24. If the town is incorporated, the entry may be made by the corporate\r\nauthorities thereof through the mayor or other principal officer duly\r\nauthorized so to do. If the town is not incorporated, the entry may be\r\nmade by the judge of the county court for the county in which said town\r\nis situated. In either case the entry must be made in trust for the use\r\nand benefit of the occupants thereof according to their respective\r\ninterests. The execution of such trust as to the disposal of lots and\r\nthe proceeds of sales is to be conducted under regulations prescribed by\r\nthe territorial laws. Acts of trustees not in accordance with such\r\nregulations are void. (See sections 2387 and 2391, U.S. Revised\r\nStatutes.)\r\n\r\n25. The officer authorized to enter a town site may make entry at once,\r\nor he may initiate an entry by filing a declaratory statement of the\r\npurpose of the inhabitants to make a town-site entry of the land\r\ndescribed. The entry or declaratory statement shall include only such\r\nland as is actually occupied by the town and the title to which is in\r\nthe United States, and its exterior limits must conform to the legal\r\nsubdivisions of the public lands.

In an effort to abridge this communication as much as is\r\nconsistent with its purpose I shall supplement a brief reference to the\r\ncontents of these departmental reports by the mention of such executive\r\nbusiness and incidents as are not embraced therein and by such\r\nrecommendations as appear to be at this particular time appropriate.\r\n\r\nWhile our foreign relations have not at all times during the past year\r\nbeen entirely free from perplexity, no embarrassing situation remains\r\nthat will not yield to the spirit of fairness and love of justice which\r\njoined with consistent firmness, characterize a truly American foreign\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nMy predecessor having accepted the office of arbitrator of the\r\nlongstanding Missions boundary dispute, tendered to the President by the\r\nArgentine Republic and Brazil, it has been my agreeable duty to receive\r\nthe special envoys commissioned by those States to lay before me\r\nevidence and arguments in behalf of their respective Governments.\r\n\r\nThe outbreak of domestic hostilities in the Republic of Brazil found\r\nthe United States alert to watch the interests of our citizens in that\r\ncountry, with which we carry on important commerce. Several vessels of\r\nour new Navy are now and for some time have been stationed at Rio de\r\nJaneiro. The struggle being between the established Government, which\r\ncontrols the machinery of administration, and with which we maintain\r\nfriendly relations, and certain officers of the navy employing the\r\nvessels of their command in an attack upon the national capital and\r\nchief seaport, and lacking as it does the elements of divided\r\nadministration, I have failed to see that the insurgents can reasonably\r\nclaim recognition as belligerents.\r\n\r\nThus far the position of our Government has been that of an attentive\r\nbut impartial observer of the unfortunate conflict. Emphasizing our\r\nfixed policy of impartial neutrality in such a condition of affairs\r\nas now exists, I deemed it necessary to disavow in a manner not to\r\nbe misunderstood the unauthorized action of our late naval commander\r\nin those waters in saluting the revolted Brazilian admiral, being\r\nindisposed to countenance an act calculated to give gratuitous sanction\r\nto the local insurrection.\r\n\r\nThe convention between our Government and Chile having for its object\r\nthe settlement and adjustment of the demands of the two countries\r\nagainst each other has been made effective by the organization of the\r\nclaims commission provided for. The two Governments failing to agree\r\nupon the third member of the commission, the good offices of the\r\nPresident of the Swiss Republic were invoked, as provided in the\r\ntreaty, and the selection of the Swiss representative in this country\r\nto complete the organization was gratifying alike to the United States\r\nand Chile.\r\n\r\nThe vexatious question of so-called legation asylum for offenders\r\nagainst the state and its laws was presented anew in Chile by the\r\nunauthorized action of the late United States minister in receiving into\r\nhis official residence two persons who had just failed in an attempt at\r\nrevolution and against whom criminal charges were pending growing out\r\nof a former abortive disturbance. The doctrine of asylum as applied to\r\nthis case is not sanctioned by the best precedents, and when allowed\r\ntends to encourage sedition and strife. Under no circumstances can the\r\nrepresentatives of this Government be permitted, under the ill-defined\r\nfiction of extraterritoriality, to interrupt the administration of\r\ncriminal justice in the countries to which they are accredited. A\r\ntemperate demand having been made by the Chilean Government for the\r\ncorrection of this conduct in the instance mentioned, the minister\r\nwas instructed no longer to harbor the offenders.\r\n\r\nThe legislation of last year known as the Geary law, requiring the\r\nregistration of all Chinese laborers entitled to residence in the United\r\nStates and the deportation of all not complying with the provisions\r\nof the act within the time prescribed, met with much opposition from\r\nChinamen in this country. Acting upon the advice of eminent counsel\r\nthat the law was unconstitutional, the great mass of Chinese laborers,\r\npending judicial inquiry as to its validity, in good faith declined to\r\napply for the certificates required by its provisions. A test case upon\r\nproceeding by _habeas corpus_ was brought before the Supreme Court,\r\nand on May 15, 1893, a decision was made by that tribunal sustaining\r\nthe law.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that under the recent amendment of the act extending the\r\ntime for registration the Chinese laborers thereto entitled who desire\r\nto reside in this country will now avail themselves of the renewed\r\nprivilege thus afforded of establishing by lawful procedure their right\r\nto remain, and that thereby the necessity of enforced deportation may\r\nto a great degree be avoided.\r\n\r\nIt has devolved upon the United States minister at Peking, as dean of\r\nthe diplomatic body, and in the absence of a representative of Sweden\r\nand Norway, to press upon the Chinese Government reparation for the\r\nrecent murder of Swedish missionaries at Sung-pu. This question is of\r\nvital interest to all countries whose citizens engage in missionary work\r\nin the interior.\r\n\r\nBy Article XII of the general act of Brussels, signed July 2, 1890,\r\nfor the suppression of the slave trade and the restriction of certain\r\ninjurious commerce in the Independent State of the Kongo and in the\r\nadjacent zone of central Africa, the United States and the other\r\nsignatory powers agreed to adopt appropriate means for the punishment\r\nof persons selling arms and ammunition to the natives and for the\r\nconfiscation of the inhibited articles. It being the plain duty of this\r\nGovernment to aid in suppressing the nefarious traffic, impairing as\r\nit does the praiseworthy and civilizing efforts now in progress in that\r\nregion, I recommend that an act be passed prohibiting the sale of arms\r\nand intoxicants, to natives in the regulated zone by our citizens.\r\n\r\nCosta Rica has lately testified its friendliness by surrendering to the\r\nUnited States, in the absence of a convention of extradition, but upon\r\nduly submitted evidence of criminality, a noted fugitive from justice.\r\nIt is trusted that the negotiation of a treaty with that country to meet\r\nrecurring cases of this kind will soon be accomplished. In my opinion\r\ntreaties for reciprocal extradition should be concluded with all those\r\ncountries with which the United States has not already conventional\r\narrangements of that character.\r\n\r\nI have deemed it fitting to express to the Governments of Costa Rica\r\nand Colombia the kindly desire of the United States to see their pending\r\nboundary dispute finally closed by arbitration in conformity with the\r\nspirit of the treaty concluded between them some years ago.\r\n\r\nOur relations with the French Republic continue to be intimate and\r\ncordial. I sincerely hope that the extradition treaty with that country,\r\nas amended by the Senate, will soon be operative.\r\n\r\nWhile occasional questions affecting our naturalized citizens returning\r\nto the land of their birth have arisen in our intercourse with Germany,\r\nour relations with that country continue satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe questions affecting our relations with Great Britain have been\r\ntreated in a spirit of friendliness.\r\n\r\nNegotiations are in progress between the two Governments with a view to\r\nsuch concurrent action as will make the award and regulations agreed\r\nupon by the Bering Sea Tribunal of Arbitration practically effective,\r\nand it is not doubted that Great Britain will cooperate freely with this\r\ncountry for the accomplishment of that purpose.\r\n\r\nThe dispute growing out of the discriminating tolls imposed in the\r\nWelland Canal upon cargoes of cereals bound to and from the lake ports\r\nof the United States was adjusted by the substitution of a more\r\nequitable schedule of charges, and my predecessor thereupon suspended\r\nhis proclamation imposing discriminating tolls upon British transit\r\nthrough our canals.[1]\r\n\r\nA request for additions to the list of extraditable offenses covered by\r\nthe existing treaty between the two countries is under consideration.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year an American citizen employed in a subordinate\r\ncommercial position in Hayti, after suffering a protracted imprisonment\r\non an unfounded charge of smuggling, was finally liberated on judicial\r\nexamination. Upon urgent representation to the Haytian Government a\r\nsuitable indemnity was paid to the sufferer.\r\n\r\nBy a law of Hayti a sailing vessel, having discharged her cargo, is\r\nrefused clearance until the duties on such cargo have been paid. The\r\nhardship of this measure upon American shipowners, who conduct the bulk\r\nof the carrying trade of that country, has been insisted on with a view\r\nof securing the removal of this cause of complaint.\r\n\r\nUpon receiving authentic information of the firing upon an American mail\r\nsteamer touching at the port of Amapala because her captain refused to\r\ndeliver up a passenger in transit from Nicaragua to Guatemala upon\r\ndemand of the military authorities of Honduras, our minister to that\r\ncountry, under instructions, protested against the wanton act and\r\ndemanded satisfaction. The Government of Honduras, actuated by a sense\r\nof justice and in a spirit of the utmost friendship, promptly disavowed\r\nthe illegal conduct of its officers and expressed sincere regret for the\r\noccurrence.\r\n\r\nIt is confidently anticipated that a satisfactory adjustment will\r\nsoon be reached of the questions arising out of the seizure and use of\r\nAmerican vessels by insurgents in Honduras and the subsequent denial by\r\nthe successful Government of commercial privileges to those vessels on\r\nthat account.\r\n\r\nA notable part of the southeasterly coast of Liberia between the Cavally\r\nand San Pedro rivers, which for nearly half a century has been generally\r\nrecognized as belonging to that Republic by cession and purchase, has\r\nbeen claimed to be under the protectorate of France in virtue of\r\nagreements entered into by the native tribes, over whom Liberia's\r\ncontrol has not been well maintained.\r\n\r\nMore recently negotiations between the Liberian representative and the\r\nFrench Government resulted in the signature at Paris of a treaty whereby\r\nas an adjustment certain Liberian territory is ceded to France. This\r\nconvention at last advices had not been ratified by the Liberian\r\nLegislature and Executive.\r\n\r\nFeeling a sympathetic interest in the fortunes of the little\r\nCommonwealth, the establishment and development of which were largely\r\naided by the benevolence of our countrymen, and which constitutes the\r\nonly independently sovereign state on the west coast of Africa, this\r\nGovernment has suggested to the French Government its earnest concern\r\nlest territorial impairment in Liberia should take place without her\r\nunconstrained consent.\r\n\r\nOur relations with Mexico continue to be of that close and friendly\r\nnature which should always characterize the intercourse of two\r\nneighboring republics.\r\n\r\nThe work of relocating the monuments marking the boundary between the\r\ntwo countries from Paso del Norte to the Pacific is now nearly\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\nThe commission recently organized under the conventions of 1884 and 1889\r\nit is expected will speedily settle disputes growing out of the shifting\r\ncurrents of the Rio Grande River east of El Paso.\r\n\r\nNicaragua has recently passed through two revolutions, the party at\r\nfirst successful having in turn been displaced by another. Our newly\r\nappointed minister by his timely good offices aided in a peaceful\r\nadjustment of the controversy involved in the first conflict. The large\r\nAmerican interests established in that country in connection with the\r\nNicaragua Canal were not molested.\r\n\r\nThe canal company has unfortunately become financially seriously\r\nembarrassed, but a generous treatment had been extended to it by the\r\nGovernment of Nicaragua. The United States are especially interested\r\nin the successful achievement of the vast undertaking this company\r\nhas in charge. That it should be accomplished under distinctively\r\nAmerican auspices, and its enjoyment assured not only to the vessels\r\nof this country as a channel of communication between our Atlantic and\r\nPacific seaboards, but to the ships of the world in the interests of\r\ncivilization, is a proposition which, in my judgment, does not admit\r\nof question.\r\n\r\nGuatemala has also been visited by the political vicissitudes which\r\nhave afflicted her Central American neighbors, but the dissolution of\r\nits Legislature and the proclamation of a dictatorship have been\r\nunattended with civil war.\r\n\r\nAn extradition treaty with Norway has recently been exchanged and\r\nproclaimed.\r\n\r\nThe extradition treaty with Russia signed in March, 1887, and amended\r\nand confirmed by the Senate in February last, was duly proclaimed last\r\nJune.\r\n\r\nLed by a desire to compose differences and contribute to the restoration\r\nof order in Samoa, which for some years previous had been the scene of\r\nconflicting foreign pretensions and native strife, the United States,\r\ndeparting from its policy consecrated by a century of observance,\r\nentered four years ago into the treaty of Berlin, thereby becoming\r\njointly bound with England and Germany to establish and maintain\r\nMalietoa Laupepa as King of Samoa. The treaty provided for a foreign\r\ncourt of justice; a municipal council for the district of Apia, with a\r\nforeign president thereof, authorized to advise the King; a tribunal for\r\nthe settlement of native and foreign land titles, and a revenue system\r\nfor the Kingdom. It entailed upon the three powers that part of the cost\r\nof the new Government not met by the revenue of the islands.\r\n\r\nEarly in the life of this triple protectorate the native dissensions it\r\nwas designed to quell revived. Rivals defied the authority of the new\r\nKing, refusing to pay taxes and demanding the election of a ruler by\r\nnative suffrage. Mataafa, an aspirant to the throne, and a large number\r\nof his native adherents were in open rebellion on one of the islands.\r\nQuite lately, at the request of the other powers and in fulfillment of\r\nits treaty obligation, this Government agreed to unite in a joint\r\nmilitary movement of such dimensions as would probably secure the\r\nsurrender of the insurgents without bloodshed.\r\n\r\nThe war ship _Philadelphia_ was accordingly put under orders for\r\nSamoa, but before she arrived the threatened conflict was precipitated\r\nby King Malietoa's attack upon the insurgent camp. Mataafa was defeated\r\nand a number of his men killed. The British and German naval vessels\r\npresent subsequently secured the surrender of Mataafa and his adherents.\r\nThe defeated chief and ten of his principal supporters were deported to\r\na German island of the Marshall group, where they are held as prisoners\r\nunder the joint responsibility and cost of the three powers.\r\n\r\nThis incident and the events leading up to it signally illustrate the\r\nimpolicy of entangling alliances with foreign powers.\r\n\r\nMore than fifteen years ago this Government preferred a claim against\r\nSpain in behalf of one of our citizens for property seized and\r\nconfiscated in Cuba. In 1886 the claim was adjusted, Spain agreeing to\r\npay unconditionally, as a fair indemnity, $1,500,000. A respectful but\r\nearnest note was recently addressed to the Spanish Government insisting\r\nupon prompt fulfillment of its long-neglected obligation.\r\n\r\nOther claims preferred by the United States against Spain in behalf of\r\nAmerican citizens for property confiscated in Cuba have been pending for\r\nmany years.\r\n\r\nAt the time Spain's title to the Caroline Islands was confirmed by\r\narbitration that Government agreed that the rights which had been\r\nacquired there by American missionaries should be recognized and\r\nrespected. It is sincerely hoped that this pledge will be observed by\r\nallowing our missionaries, who were removed from Ponape to a place of\r\nsafety by a United States war ship during the late troubles between the\r\nSpanish garrison and the natives, to return to their field of\r\nusefulness.\r\n\r\nThe reproduced caravel _Santa Maria_, built by Spain and sent to\r\nthe Columbian Exposition, has been presented to the United States in\r\ntoken of amity and in commemoration of the event it was designed to\r\ncelebrate. I recommend that in accepting this gift Congress make\r\ngrateful recognition of the sincere friendship which prompted it.\r\n\r\nImportant matters have demanded attention in our relations with the\r\nOttoman Porte.\r\n\r\nThe firing and partial destruction by an unrestrained mob of one of the\r\nschool buildings of Anatolia College, established by citizens of the\r\nUnited States at Marsovan, and the apparent indifference of the Turkish\r\nGovernment to the outrage, notwithstanding the complicity of some of its\r\nofficials, called for earnest remonstrance, which was followed by\r\npromise of reparation and punishment of the offenders.\r\n\r\nIndemnity for the injury to the buildings has already been paid,\r\npermission to rebuild given, registration of the school property in the\r\nname of the American owners secured, and efficient protection\r\nguaranteed.\r\n\r\nInformation received of maltreatment suffered by an inoffensive American\r\nwoman engaged in missionary work in Turkish Koordistan was followed by\r\nsuch representations to the Porte as resulted in the issuance of orders\r\nfor the punishment of her assailants, the removal of a delinquent\r\nofficial, and the adoption of measures for the protection of our\r\ncitizens engaged in mission and other lawful work in that quarter.\r\n\r\nTurkey complains that her Armenian subjects obtain citizenship in this\r\ncountry not to identify themselves in good faith with our people, but\r\nwith the intention of returning to the land of their birth and there\r\nengaging in sedition. This complaint is not wholly without foundation.\r\nA journal published in this country in the Armenian language openly\r\ncounsels its readers to arm, organize, and participate in movements\r\nfor the subversion of Turkish authority in the Asiatic provinces.\r\nThe Ottoman Government has announced its intention to expel from its\r\ndominions Armenians who have obtained naturalization in the United\r\nStates since 1868.\r\n\r\nThe right to exclude any or all classes of aliens is an attribute of\r\nsovereignty. It is a right asserted and, to a limited extent, enforced\r\nby the United States, with the sanction of our highest court. There\r\nbeing no naturalization treaty between the United States and Turkey, our\r\nminister at Constantinople has been instructed that, while recognizing\r\nthe right of that Government to enforce its declared policy against\r\nnaturalized Armenians, he is expected to protect them from unnecessary\r\nharshness of treatment.\r\n\r\nIn view of the impaired financial resources of Venezuela consequent upon\r\nthe recent revolution there, a modified arrangement for the satisfaction\r\nof the awards of the late revisory claims commission, in progressive\r\ninstallments, has been assented to, and payments are being regularly\r\nmade thereunder.\r\n\r\nThe boundary dispute between Venezuela and British Guiana is yet\r\nunadjusted. A restoration of diplomatic intercourse between that\r\nRepublic and Great Britain and reference of the question to impartial\r\narbitration would be a most gratifying consummation.\r\n\r\nThe ratification by Venezuela of the convention for the arbitration of\r\nthe long-deferred claim of the Venezuelan Transportation Company is\r\nawaited.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary for me to state that the questions arising\r\nfrom our relations with Hawaii have caused serious embarrassment.\r\nJust prior to the installation of the present Administration the\r\nexisting Government of Hawaii had been suddenly overthrown and a treaty\r\nof annexation had been negotiated between the Provisional Government\r\nof the islands and the United States and submitted to the Senate for\r\nratification. This treaty I withdrew for examination and dispatched\r\nHon. James H. Blount, of Georgia, to Honolulu as a special commissioner\r\nto make an impartial investigation of the circumstances attending the\r\nchange of government and of all the conditions bearing upon the subject\r\nof the treaty. After a thorough and exhaustive examination Mr. Blount\r\nsubmitted to me his report, showing beyond all question that the\r\nconstitutional Government of Hawaii had been subverted with the\r\nactive aid of our representative to that Government and through the\r\nintimidation caused by the presence of an armed naval force of the\r\nUnited States, which was landed for that purpose at the instance of our\r\nminister. Upon the facts developed it seemed to me the only honorable\r\ncourse for our Government to pursue was to undo the wrong that had been\r\ndone by those representing us and to restore as far as practicable the\r\nstatus existing at the time of our forcible intervention. With a view of\r\naccomplishing this result within the constitutional limits of executive\r\npower, and recognizing all our obligations and responsibilities growing\r\nout of any changed conditions brought about by our unjustifiable\r\ninterference, our present minister at Honolulu has received appropriate\r\ninstructions to that end. Thus far no information of the accomplishment\r\nof any definite results has been received from him.\r\n\r\nAdditional advices are soon expected. When received they will be\r\npromptly sent to the Congress, together with all other information at\r\nhand, accompanied by a special Executive message fully detailing all the\r\nfacts necessary to a complete understanding of the case and presenting a\r\nhistory of all the material events leading up to the present situation.\r\n\r\nBy a concurrent resolution passed by the Senate February 14, 1890,\r\nand by the House of Representatives on the 3d of April following the\r\nPresident was requested to \"invite from time to time, as fit occasions\r\nmay arise, negotiations with any government with which the United States\r\nhas or may have diplomatic relations, to the end that any differences or\r\ndisputes arising between the two governments which can not be adjusted\r\nby diplomatic agency may be referred to arbitration and be peaceably\r\nadjusted by such means.\" April 18, 1890, the International American\r\nConference of Washington by resolution expressed the wish that all\r\ncontroversies between the republics of America and the nations of Europe\r\nmight be settled by arbitration, and recommended that the government of\r\neach nation represented in that conference should communicate this wish\r\nto all friendly powers. A favorable response has been received from\r\nGreat Britain in the shape of a resolution adopted by Parliament July 16\r\nlast, cordially sympathizing with the purpose in view and expressing the\r\nhope that Her Majesty's Government will lend ready cooperation to the\r\nGovernment of the United States upon the basis of the concurrent\r\nresolution above quoted.\r\n\r\nIt affords me signal pleasure to lay this parliamentary resolution\r\nbefore the Congress and to express my sincere gratification that the\r\nsentiment of two great and kindred nations is thus authoritatively\r\nmanifested in favor of the rational and peaceable settlement of\r\ninternational quarrels by honorable resort to arbitration.\r\n\r\nSince the passage of the act of March 3, 1893, authorizing the President\r\nto raise the grade of our envoys to correspond with the rank in which\r\nforeign countries accredit their agents here, Great Britain, France,\r\nItaly, and Germany have conferred upon their representatives at this\r\ncapital the title of ambassador, and I have responded by accrediting the\r\nagents of the United States in those countries with the same title. A\r\nlike elevation of mission is announced by Russia, and when made will be\r\nsimilarly met. This step fittingly comports with the position the United\r\nStates hold in the family of nations.\r\n\r\nDuring my former Administration I took occasion to recommend a recast of\r\nthe laws relating to the consular service, in order that it might become\r\na more efficient agency in the promotion of the interests it was\r\nintended to subserve. The duties and powers of consuls have been\r\nexpanded with the growing requirements of our foreign trade. Discharging\r\nimportant duties affecting our commerce and American citizens abroad,\r\nand in certain countries exercising judicial functions, these officers\r\nshould be men of character, intelligence, and ability.\r\n\r\nUpon proof that the legislation of Denmark secures copyright to American\r\ncitizens on equal footing with its own, the privileges of our copyright\r\nlaws have been extended by proclamation to subjects of that country.[2]\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Treasury reports that the receipts of the\r\nGovernment from all sources during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1893,\r\namounted to $461,716,561.94 and its expenditures to $459,374,674.29.\r\nThere was collected from customs $205,355,016.73 and from internal\r\nrevenue $161,027,623.93. Our dutiable imports amounted to $421,856,711,\r\nan increase of $52,453,907 over the preceding year, and importations\r\nfree of duty amounted to $444,544,211, a decrease from the preceding\r\nyear of $13,455,447. Internal-revenue receipts exceeded those of the\r\npreceding year by $7,147,445.32. The total tax collected on distilled\r\nspirits was $94,720,260.55, on manufactured tobacco $31,889,711.74, and\r\non fermented liquors $32,548,983.07. We exported merchandise during the\r\nyear amounting to $847,665,194, a decrease of $182,612,954 from the\r\npreceding year. The amount of gold exported was larger than any previous\r\nyear in the history of the Government, amounting to $108,680,844, and\r\nexceeding the amount exported during the preceding year by $58,485,517.\r\n\r\nThe sum paid from the Treasury for sugar bounty was $9,375,130.88, an\r\nincrease over the preceding year of $2,033,053.09.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated upon the basis of present revenue laws that the receipts\r\nof the Government for the year ending June 30, 1894, will be\r\n$430,121,365.38 and its expenditures $458,121,365.28, resulting in a\r\ndeficiency of $28,000,000.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st day of November, 1893, the amount of money of all kinds in\r\ncirculation, or not included in Treasury holdings, was $1,718,544,682,\r\nan increase for the year of $112,404,947. Estimating our population at\r\n67,426,000 at the time mentioned, the per capita circulation was $25.49.\r\nOn the same date there was in the Treasury gold bullion amounting to\r\n$96,657,273 and silver bullion which was purchased at a cost of\r\n$126,261,553.\r\n\r\nThe purchases of silver under the law of July 14, 1890, during the last\r\nfiscal year aggregated 54,008,162.59 fine ounces, which cost\r\n$45,531,374.53. The total amount of silver purchased from the time that\r\nlaw became operative until the repeal of its purchasing clause, on the\r\n1st day of November, 1893, was 168,674,590.46 fine ounces, which cost\r\n$155,930,940.84. Between the 1st day of March, 1873, and the 1st day of\r\nNovember, 1893, the Government purchased under all laws 503,003,717 fine\r\nounces of silver, at a cost of $516,622,948. The silver dollars that\r\nhave been coined under the act of July 14, 1890, number 36,087,285. The\r\nseigniorage arising from such coinage was $6,977,098.39, leaving on hand\r\nin the mints 140,699,760 fine ounces of silver, which cost $126,758,218.\r\n\r\nOur total coinage of all metals during the last fiscal year consisted\r\nof 97,280,875 pieces, valued at $43,685,178.80, of which there was\r\n$30,038,140 in gold coin, $5,343,715 in silver dollars, $7,217,220.90\r\nin subsidiary silver coin, and $1,086,102.90 in minor coins.\r\n\r\nDuring the calendar year 1892 the production of precious metals in the\r\nUnited States was estimated to be 1,596,375 fine ounces of gold of the\r\ncommercial and coinage value of $33,000,000 and 58,000,000 fine ounces\r\nof silver of the bullion or market value of $50,750,000 and of the\r\ncoinage value of $74,989,900.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that on the 1st day of July, 1893, the metallic stock of\r\nmoney in the United States, consisting of coin and bullion, amounted to\r\n$1,213,559,169, of which $597,697,685 was gold and $615,861,484 was\r\nsilver.\r\n\r\nOne hundred and nineteen national banks were organized during the\r\nyear ending October 31, 1893, with a capital of $11,230,000. Forty-six\r\nwent into voluntary liquidation and 158 suspended. Sixty-five of the\r\nsuspended banks were insolvent, 86 resumed business, and 7 remain in the\r\nhands of the bank examiners, with prospects of speedy resumption. Of the\r\nnew banks organized, 44 were located in the Eastern States, 41 west of\r\nthe Mississippi River, and 34 in the Central and Southern States. The\r\ntotal number of national banks in existence on October 31, 1893, was\r\n3,796, having an aggregate capital of $695,558,120. The net increase\r\nin the circulation of these banks during the year was $36,886,972.\r\n\r\nThe recent repeal of the provision of law requiring the purchase of\r\nsilver bullion by the Government as a feature of our monetary scheme has\r\nmade an entire change in the complexion of our currency affairs. I do\r\nnot doubt that the ultimate result of this action will be most salutary\r\nand far-reaching. In the nature of things, however, it is impossible to\r\nknow at this time precisely what conditions will be brought about by the\r\nchange, or what, if any, supplementary legislation may in the light of\r\nsuch conditions appear to be essential or expedient. Of course, after\r\nthe recent financial perturbation, time is necessary for the\r\nreestablishment of business confidence. When, however, through this\r\nrestored confidence, the money which has been frightened into hoarding\r\nplaces is returned to trade and enterprise, a survey of the situation\r\nwill probably disclose a safe path leading to a permanently sound\r\ncurrency, abundantly sufficient to meet every requirement of our\r\nincreasing population and business.\r\n\r\nIn the pursuit of this object we should resolutely turn away from\r\nalluring and temporary expedients, determined to be content with nothing\r\nless than a lasting and comprehensive financial plan. In these\r\ncircumstances I am convinced that a reasonable delay in dealing with\r\nthis subject, instead of being injurious, will increase the probability\r\nof wise action.\r\n\r\nThe monetary conference which assembled at Brussels upon our invitation\r\nwas adjourned to the 30th day of November of the present year. The\r\nconsiderations just stated and the fact that a definite proposition\r\nfrom us seemed to be expected upon the reassembling of the conference\r\nled me to express a willingness to have the meeting still further\r\npostponed.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that it would be wise to give general authority to the\r\nPresident to invite other nations to such a conference at any time when\r\nthere should be a fair prospect of accomplishing an international\r\nagreement on the subject of coinage.\r\n\r\nI desire also to earnestly suggest the wisdom of amending the existing\r\nstatutes in regard to the issuance of Government bonds. The authority\r\nnow vested in the Secretary of the Treasury to issue bonds is not as\r\nclear as it should be, and the bonds authorized are disadvantageous to\r\nthe Government both as to the time of their maturity and rate of\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nThe Superintendent of Immigration, through the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, reports that during the last fiscal year there arrived at our\r\nports 440,793 immigrants. Of these, 1,063 were not permitted to land\r\nunder the limitations of the law and 577 were returned to the countries\r\nfrom whence they came by reason of their having become public charges.\r\nThe total arrivals were 141,034 less than for the previous year.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary in his report gives an account of the operation of the\r\nMarine-Hospital Service and of the good work done under its supervision\r\nin preventing the entrance and spread of contagious diseases.\r\n\r\nThe admonitions of the last two years touching our public health and the\r\ndemonstrated danger of the introduction of contagious diseases from\r\nforeign ports have invested the subject of national quarantine with\r\nincreased interest. A more general and harmonious system than now\r\nexists, acting promptly and directly everywhere and constantly operating\r\nby preventive means to shield our country from the invasion of disease,\r\nand at the same time having due regard to the rights and duties of local\r\nagencies, would, I believe, add greatly to the safety of our people.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War reports that the strength of the Army on the 30th\r\nday of September last was 25,778 enlisted men and 2,144 officers.\r\n\r\nThe total expenditures of the Department for the year ending June 30,\r\n1893, amounted to $51,966,074.89. Of this sum $1,992,581.95 was for\r\nsalaries and contingent expenses, $23,377,828.35 for the support of the\r\nmilitary establishment, $6,077,033.18 for miscellaneous objects, and\r\n$20,518,631.41 for public works. This latter sum includes $15,296,876.46\r\nfor river and harbor improvements and $3,266,141.20 for fortifications\r\nand other works of defense.\r\n\r\nThe total enrollment of the militia of the several States was on the\r\n31st of October of the current year 112,597 officers and enlisted men.\r\nThe officers of the Army detailed for the inspection and instruction of\r\nthis reserve of our military force report that increased interest and\r\nmarked progress are apparent in the discipline and efficiency of the\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nNeither Indian outbreaks nor domestic violence have called the\r\nArmy into service during the year, and the only active military duty\r\nrequired of it has been in the Department of Texas, where violations of\r\nthe neutrality laws of the United States and Mexico were promptly and\r\nefficiently dealt with by the troops, eliciting the warm approval of the\r\ncivil and military authorities of both countries.\r\n\r\nThe operation of wise laws and the influences of civilization constantly\r\ntending to relieve the country from the dangers of Indian hostilities,\r\ntogether with the increasing ability of the States, through the\r\nefficiency of the National Guard organizations, to protect their\r\ncitizens from domestic violence, lead to the suggestion that the time is\r\nfast approaching when there should be a reorganization of our Army on\r\nthe lines of the present necessities of the country. This change\r\ncontemplates neither increase in number nor added expense, but a\r\nredistribution of the force and an encouragement of measures tending to\r\ngreater efficiency among the men and improvement of the service.\r\n\r\nThe adoption of battalion formations for infantry regiments, the\r\nstrengthening of the artillery force, the abandonment of smaller and\r\nunnecessary posts, and the massing of the troops at important and\r\naccessible stations all promise to promote the usefulness of the Army.\r\nIn the judgment of army officers, with but few exceptions, the operation\r\nof the law forbidding the reenlistment of men after ten years' service\r\nhas not proved its wisdom, and while the arguments that led to its\r\nadoption were not without merit the experience of the year constrains me\r\nto join in the recommendation for its repeal.\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to note that we have begun to attain completed results\r\nin the comprehensive scheme of seacoast defense and fortification\r\nentered upon eight years ago. A large sum has been already expended, but\r\nthe cost of maintenance will be inconsiderable as compared with the\r\nexpense of construction and ordnance. At the end of the current calendar\r\nyear the War Department will have nine 12-inch guns, twenty 10-inch, and\r\nthirty-four 8-inch guns ready to be mounted on gun lifts and carriages,\r\nand seventy-five 12-inch mortars. In addition to the product of the Army\r\nGun Factory, now completed at Watervliet, the Government has contracted\r\nwith private parties for the purchase of one hundred guns of these\r\ncalibers, the first of which should be delivered to the Department for\r\ntest before July 1, 1894.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of heavy ordnance keeps pace with current needs, but to\r\nrender these guns available for the purposes they are designed to meet\r\nemplacements must be prepared for them. Progress has been made in this\r\ndirection, and it is desirable that Congress by adequate appropriations\r\nshould provide for the uninterrupted prosecution of this necessary work.\r\n\r\nAfter much preliminary work and exhaustive examination in accordance\r\nwith the requirements of the law, the board appointed to select a\r\nmagazine rifle of modern type with which to replace the obsolete\r\nSpringfield rifle of the infantry service completed its labors during\r\nthe last year, and the work of manufacture is now in progress at the\r\nnational armory at Springfield. It is confidently expected that by the\r\nend of the current year our infantry will be supplied with a weapon\r\nequal to that of the most progressive armies of the world.\r\n\r\nThe work on the projected Chickamauga and Chattanooga National\r\nMilitary Park has been prosecuted with zeal and judgment, and its\r\nopening will be celebrated during the coming year. Over 9 square miles\r\nof the Chickamauga battlefield have been acquired, 25 miles of roadway\r\nhave been constructed, and permanent tablets have been placed at many\r\nhistorical points, while the invitation to the States to mark the\r\npositions of their troops participating in the battle has been very\r\ngenerally accepted.\r\n\r\nThe work of locating and preserving the lines of battle at the\r\nGettysburg battlefield is making satisfactory progress on the plans\r\ndirected by the last Congress.\r\n\r\nThe reports of the Military Academy at West Point and the several\r\nschools for special instruction of officers show marked advance in the\r\neducation of the Army and a commendable ambition among its officers to\r\nexcel in the military profession and to fit themselves for the highest\r\nservice to the country.\r\n\r\nUnder the supervision of Adjutant-General Robert Williams, lately\r\nretired, the Bureau of Military Information has become well established\r\nand is performing a service that will put in possession of the\r\nGovernment in time of war most valuable information, and at all times\r\nserve a purpose of great utility in keeping the Army advised of the\r\nworld's progress in all matters pertaining to the art of war.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Attorney-General contains the usual summary of the\r\naffairs and proceedings of the Department of Justice for the past year,\r\ntogether with certain recommendations as to needed legislation on\r\nvarious subjects. I can not too heartily indorse the proposition that\r\nthe fee system as applicable to the compensation of United States\r\nattorneys, marshals, clerks of Federal courts, and United States\r\ncommissioners should be abolished with as little delay as possible. It\r\nis clearly in the interest of the community that the business of the\r\ncourts, both civil and criminal, shall be as small and as inexpensively\r\ntransacted as the ends of justice will allow.\r\n\r\nThe system is therefore thoroughly vicious which makes the compensation\r\nof court officials depend upon the volume of such business, and thus\r\ncreates a conflict between a proper execution of the law and private\r\ngain, which can not fail to be dangerous to the rights and freedom of\r\nthe citizen and an irresistible temptation to the unjustifiable\r\nexpenditure of public funds. If in addition to this reform another was\r\ninaugurated which would give to United States commissioners the final\r\ndisposition of petty offenses within the grade of misdemeanors,\r\nespecially those coming under the internal-revenue laws, a great advance\r\nwould be made toward a more decent administration of the criminal law.\r\n\r\nIn my first message to Congress, dated December 8, 1885,[3] I strongly\r\nrecommended these changes and referred somewhat at length to the evils\r\nof the present system. Since that time the criminal business of the\r\nFederal courts and the expense attending it have enormously increased.\r\nThe number of criminal prosecutions pending in the circuit and district\r\ncourts of the United States on the 1st day of July, 1885, was 3,808, of\r\nwhich 1,884 were for violations of the internal-revenue laws, while the\r\nnumber of such prosecutions pending on the 1st day of July, 1893, was\r\n9,500, of which 4,200 were for violations of the internal-revenue laws.\r\nThe expense of the United States courts, exclusive of judges' salaries,\r\nfor the year ending July 1, 1885, was $2,874,733.11 and for the year\r\nending July 1, 1893, $4,528,676.87.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore apparent that the reasons given in 1885 for a change in\r\nthe manner of enforcing the Federal criminal law have gained cogency and\r\nstrength by lapse of time.\r\n\r\nI also heartily join the Attorney-General in recommending legislation\r\nfixing degrees of the crime of murder within Federal jurisdiction, as\r\nhas been done in many of the States; authorizing writs of error on\r\nbehalf of the Government in cases where final judgment is rendered\r\nagainst the sufficiency of an indictment or against the Government upon\r\nany other question arising before actual trial; limiting the right of\r\nreview in cases of felony punishable only by fine and imprisonment to\r\nthe circuit court of appeals, and making speedy provision for the\r\nconstruction of such prisons and reformatories as may be necessary for\r\nthe confinement of United States convicts.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster-General contains a detailed statement of\r\nthe operations of the Post-Office Department during the last fiscal year\r\nand much interesting information touching this important branch of the\r\npublic service.\r\n\r\nThe business of the mails indicates with absolute certainty the\r\ncondition of the business of the country, and depression in financial\r\naffairs inevitably and quickly reduces the postal revenues. Therefore\r\na larger discrepancy than usual between the post-office receipts and\r\nexpenditures is the expected and unavoidable result of the distressing\r\nstringency which has prevailed throughout the country during much of the\r\ntime covered by the Postmaster-General's report. At a date when better\r\ntimes were anticipated it was estimated by his predecessor that the\r\ndeficiency on the 30th day of June, 1893, would be but a little over\r\na million and a half dollars. It amounted, however, to more than five\r\nmillions. At the same time and under the influence of like anticipations\r\nestimates were made for the current fiscal year, ending June 30, 1894,\r\nwhich exhibited a surplus of revenue over expenditures of $872,245.71;\r\nbut now, in view of the actual receipts and expenditures during that\r\npart of the current fiscal year already expired, the present\r\nPostmaster-General estimates that at its close instead of a surplus\r\nthere will be a deficiency of nearly $8,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe post-office receipts for the last fiscal year amounted to\r\n$75,896,933.16 and its expenditures to $81,074,104.90. This post-office\r\ndeficiency would disappear or be immensely decreased if less matter were\r\ncarried free through the mails, an item of which is upward of 300 tons\r\nof seeds and grain from the Agricultural Department.\r\n\r\nThe total number of post-offices in the United States on the 30th day of\r\nJune, 1893, was 68,403, an increase of 1,284 over the preceding year. Of\r\nthese, 3,360 were Presidential, an increase in that class of 204 over\r\nthe preceding year.\r\n\r\nForty-two free-delivery offices were added during the year to those\r\nalready existing, making a total of 610 cities and towns provided with\r\nfree delivery on June 30, 1893. Ninety-three other cities and towns are\r\nnow entitled to this service under the law, but it has not been accorded\r\nthem on account of insufficient funds to meet the expenses of its\r\nestablishment.\r\n\r\nI am decidedly of the opinion that the provisions of the present law\r\npermit as general an introduction of this feature of mail service as\r\nis necessary or justifiable, and that it ought not to be extended to\r\nsmaller communities than are now designated.\r\n\r\nThe expenses of free delivery for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1894,\r\nwill be more than $11,000,000, and under legislation now existing there\r\nmust be a constant increase in this item of expenditure.\r\n\r\nThere were 6,401 additions to the domestic money-order offices during\r\nthe last fiscal year, being the largest increase in any year since the\r\ninauguration of the system. The total number of these offices at the\r\nclose of the year was 18,434. There were 13,309,735 money orders issued\r\nfrom these offices, being an increase over the preceding year of\r\n1,240,293, and the value of these orders amounted to $127,576,433.65, an\r\nincrease of $7,509,632.58. There were also issued during the year postal\r\nnotes amounting to $12,903,076.73.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 195 international money-order offices were added to\r\nthose already provided, making a total of 2,407 in operation on June 30,\r\n1893. The number of international money orders issued during the year\r\nwas 1,055,999, an increase over the preceding year of 72,525, and their\r\nvalue was $16,341,837.86, an increase of $1,221,506.31. The number of\r\norders paid was 300,917, an increase over the preceding year of 13,503,\r\nand their value was $5,283,375.70, an increase of $94,094.83.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing statements it appears that the total issue of money\r\norders and postal notes for the year amounted to $156,821,348.24.\r\n\r\nThe number of letters and packages mailed during the year for special\r\ndelivery was 3,375,693, an increase over the preceding year of nearly\r\n22 per cent. The special-delivery stamps used upon these letters and\r\npackages amounted to $337,569.30, and the messengers' fees paid for\r\ntheir delivery amounted to $256,592.71, leaving a profit to the\r\nGovernment of $80,976.59.\r\n\r\nThe Railway Mail Service not only adds to the promptness of\r\nmail delivery at all offices, but it is the especial instrumentality\r\nwhich puts the smaller and way places in the service on an equality\r\nin that regard with the larger and terminal offices. This branch\r\nof the postal service has therefore received much attention from the\r\nPostmaster-General, and though it is gratifying to know that it is in\r\na condition of high efficiency and great usefulness, I am led to agree\r\nwith the Postmaster-General that there is room for its further\r\nimprovement.\r\n\r\nThere are now connected to the Post-Office establishment 28,324\r\nemployees who are in the classified service. The head of this great\r\nDepartment gives conclusive evidence of the value of civil-service\r\nreform when, after an experience that renders his judgment on the\r\nsubject absolutely reliable, he expresses the opinion that without\r\nthe benefit of this system it would be impossible to conduct the vast\r\nbusiness intrusted to him.\r\n\r\nI desire to commend as especially worthy of prompt attention the\r\nsuggestions of the Postmaster-General relating to a more sensible and\r\nbusinesslike organization and a better distribution of responsibility\r\nin his Department.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Navy contains a history of the\r\noperations of his Department during the past year and exhibits a most\r\ngratifying condition of the personnel of our Navy. He presents a\r\nsatisfactory account of the progress which has been made in the\r\nconstruction of vessels and makes a number of recommendations to which\r\nattention is especially invited.\r\n\r\nDuring the past six months the demands for cruising vessels have been\r\nmany and urgent. There have been revolutions calling for vessels to\r\nprotect American interests in Nicaragua, Guatemala, Costa Rica,\r\nHonduras, Argentina, and Brazil, while the condition of affairs in\r\nHonolulu has required the constant presence of one or more ships. With\r\nall these calls upon our Navy it became necessary, in order to make up a\r\nsufficient fleet to patrol the Bering Sea under the _modus vivendi_\r\nagreed upon with Great Britain, to detail to that service one vessel\r\nfrom the Fish Commission and three from the Revenue Marine.\r\n\r\nProgress in the construction of new vessels has not been as rapid as\r\nwas anticipated. There have been delays in the completion of unarmored\r\nvessels, but for the most part they have been such as are constantly\r\noccurring even in countries having the largest experience in naval\r\nshipbuilding. The most serious delays, however, have been in the work\r\nupon armored ships. The trouble has been the failure of contractors to\r\ndeliver armor as agreed. The difficulties seem now, however, to have\r\nbeen all overcome, and armor is being delivered with satisfactory\r\npromptness. As a result of the experience acquired by shipbuilders and\r\ndesigners and material men, it is believed that the dates when vessels\r\nwill be completed can now be estimated with reasonable accuracy. Great\r\nguns, rapid-fire guns, torpedoes, and powder are being promptly\r\nsupplied.\r\n\r\nThe following vessels of the new Navy have been completed and are\r\nnow ready for service: The double-turreted coast-defense monitor\r\n_Miantonomoh_, the double-turreted coast-defense monitor _Monterey_,\r\nthe armored cruiser _New York_, the protected cruisers _Baltimore_,\r\n_Chicago_, _Philadelphia_, _Newark_, _San Francisco_, _Charleston_,\r\n_Atlanta_, and _Boston_, the cruiser _Detroit_, the gunboats _Yorktown_,\r\n_Concord_, _Bennington_, _Machias_, _Castine_, and _Petrel_, the\r\ndispatch vessel _Dolphin_, the practice vessel _Bancroft_, and the\r\ndynamite gunboat _Vesuvius_. Of these the _Bancroft_, _Machias_,\r\n_Detroit_, and _Castine_ have been placed in commission during the current\r\ncalendar year.\r\n\r\nThe following vessels are in process of construction: The second-class\r\nbattle ships _Maine_ and _Texas_, the cruisers _Montgomery_ and\r\n_Marblehead_, and the coast-defense monitors _Terror_, _Puritan_,\r\n_Amphitrite_, and _Monadnock_, all of which will be completed within one\r\nyear; the harbor-defense ram _Katahdin_ and the protected cruisers\r\n_Columbia_, _Minneapolis_, _Olympia_, _Cincinnati_, and _Raleigh_, all\r\nof which will be completed prior to July 1, 1895; the first-class battle\r\nships _Iowa_, _Indiana_, _Massachusetts_, and _Oregon_, which will be\r\ncompleted February 1, 1896, and the armored cruiser _Brooklyn_, which\r\nwill be completed by August 1 of that year. It is also expected that the\r\nthree gunboats authorized by the last Congress will be completed in less\r\nthan two years.\r\n\r\nSince 1886 Congress has at each session authorized the building of one\r\nor more vessels, and the Secretary of the Navy presents an earnest plea\r\nfor the continuance of this plan. He recommends the authorization of at\r\nleast one battle ship and six torpedo boats.\r\n\r\nWhile I am distinctly in favor of consistently pursuing the policy we\r\nhave inaugurated of building up a thorough and efficient Navy, I can not\r\nrefrain from the suggestion that the Congress should carefully take into\r\naccount the number of unfinished vessels on our hands and the depleted\r\ncondition of our Treasury in considering the propriety of an\r\nappropriation at this time to begin new work.\r\n\r\nThe method of employing mechanical labor at navy-yards through boards of\r\nlabor and making efficiency the sole test by which laborers are employed\r\nand continued is producing the best results, and the Secretary is\r\nearnestly devoting himself to its development. Attention is invited to\r\nthe statements of his report in regard to the workings of the system.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Interior has the supervision of so many important\r\nsubjects that his report is of especial value and interest.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th day of June, 1893, there were on the pension rolls 966,012\r\nnames, an increase of 89,944 over the number on the rolls June 30, 1892.\r\nOf these there were 17 widows and daughters of Revolutionary soldiers,\r\n86 survivors of the War of 1812, 5,425 widows of soldiers of that war,\r\n21,518 survivors and widows of the Mexican War, 3,882 survivors and\r\nwidows of Indian wars, 284 army nurses, and 475,645 survivors and\r\nwidows and children of deceased soldiers and sailors of the War of the\r\nRebellion. The latter number represents those pensioned on account of\r\ndisabilities or death resulting from army and navy service. The number\r\nof persons remaining on the rolls June 30, 1893, who were pensioned\r\nunder the act of June 27, 1890, which allows pensions on account of\r\ndeath and disability not chargeable to army service, was 459,155.\r\n\r\nThe number added to the rolls during the year was 123,634 and the number\r\ndropped was 33,690. The first payments on pensions allowed during the\r\nyear amounted to $33,756,549.98. This includes arrears, or the\r\naccumulation between the time from which the allowance of pension dates\r\nand the time of actually granting the certificate.\r\n\r\nAlthough the law of 1890 permits pensions for disabilities not related\r\nto military service, yet as a requisite to its benefits a disability\r\nmust exist incapacitating applicants \"from the performance of manual\r\nlabor to such a degree as to render them unable to earn a support.\" The\r\nexecution of this law in its early stages does not seem to have been in\r\naccord with its true intention, but toward the close of the last\r\nAdministration an authoritative construction was given to the statute,\r\nand since that time this construction has been followed. This has had\r\nthe effect of limiting the operation of the law to its intended purpose.\r\nThe discovery having been made that many names had been put upon the\r\npension roll by means of wholesale and gigantic frauds, the Commissioner\r\nsuspended payments upon a number of pensions which seemed to be\r\nfraudulent or unauthorized pending a complete examination, giving notice\r\nto the pensioners, in order that they might have an opportunity to\r\nestablish, if possible, the justice of their claims notwithstanding\r\napparent invalidity.\r\n\r\nThis, I understand, is the practice which has for a long time prevailed\r\nin the Pension Bureau; but after entering upon these recent\r\ninvestigations the Commissioner modified this rule so as not to allow\r\nuntil after a complete examination interference with the payment of a\r\npension apparently not altogether void, but which merely had been fixed\r\nat a rate higher than that authorized by law.\r\n\r\nI am unable to understand why frauds in the pension rolls should\r\nnot be exposed and corrected with thoroughness and vigor. Every name\r\nfraudulently put upon these rolls is a wicked imposition upon the\r\nkindly sentiment in which pensions have their origin; every fraudulent\r\npensioner has become a bad citizen; every false oath in support of\r\na pension has made perjury more common, and false and undeserving\r\npensioners rob the people not only of their money, but of the patriotic\r\nsentiment which the survivors of a war fought for the preservation of\r\nthe Union ought to inspire. Thousands of neighborhoods have their\r\nwell-known fraudulent pensioners, and recent developments by the Bureau\r\nestablish appalling conspiracies to accomplish pension frauds. By no\r\nmeans the least wrong done is to brave and deserving pensioners, who\r\ncertainly ought not to be condemned to such association. Those who\r\nattempt in the line of duty to rectify these wrongs should not be\r\naccused of enmity or indifference to the claims of honest veterans.\r\n\r\nThe sum expended on account of pensions for the year ending June 30,\r\n1893, was $156,740,467.14.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner estimates that $165,000,000 will be required to pay\r\npensions during the year ending June 30, 1894.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the Indians and their ultimate fate are subjects which\r\nare related to a sacred duty of the Government and which strongly appeal\r\nto the sense of justice and the sympathy of our people.\r\n\r\nOur Indians number about 248,000. Most of them are located on 161\r\nreservations, containing 86,116,531 acres of land. About 110,000 of\r\nthese Indians have to a large degree adopted civilized customs. Lands in\r\nseveralty have been allotted to many of them. Such allotments have been\r\nmade to 10,000 individuals during the last fiscal year, embracing about\r\n1,000,000 acres. The number of Indian Government schools opened during\r\nthe year was 195, an increase of 12 over the preceding year. Of this\r\ntotal 170 were on reservations, of which 73 were boarding schools and 97\r\nwere day schools. Twenty boarding schools and 5 day schools supported by\r\nthe Government were not located on reservations. The total number of\r\nIndian children enrolled during the year as attendants of all schools\r\nwas 21,138, an increase of 1,231 over the enrollment for the previous\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nI am sure that secular education and moral and religious teaching must\r\nbe important factors in any effort to save the Indian and lead him to\r\ncivilization. I believe, too, that the relinquishment of tribal\r\nrelations and the holding of land in severalty may in favorable\r\nconditions aid this consummation. It seems to me, however, that\r\nallotments of land in severalty ought to be made with great care and\r\ncircumspection. If hastily done, before the Indian knows its meaning,\r\nwhile yet he has little or no idea of tilling a farm and no conception\r\nof thrift, there is great danger that a reservation life in tribal\r\nrelations may be exchanged for the pauperism of civilization instead of\r\nits independence and elevation.\r\n\r\nThe solution of the Indian problem depends very largely upon good\r\nadministration. The personal fitness of agents and their adaptability to\r\nthe peculiar duty of caring for their wards are of the utmost importance.\r\n\r\nThe law providing that, except in special cases, army officers shall be\r\ndetailed as Indian agents it is hoped will prove a successful experiment.\r\n\r\nThere is danger of great abuses creeping into the prosecution of claims\r\nfor Indian depredations, and I recommend that every possible safeguard\r\nbe provided against the enforcement of unjust and fictitious claims of\r\nthis description.\r\n\r\nThe appropriations on account of the Indian Bureau for the year ending\r\nJune 30, 1894, amount to $7,954,962.99, a decrease as compared with the\r\nyear preceding it of $387,131.95.\r\n\r\nThe vast area of land which but a short time ago constituted the public\r\ndomain is rapidly falling into private hands. It is certain that in\r\nthe transfer the beneficent intention of the Government to supply from\r\nits domain homes to the industrious and worthy home seekers is often\r\nfrustrated. Though the speculator, who stands with extortionate purpose\r\nbetween the land office and those who, with their families, are invited\r\nby the Government to settle on the public lands, is a despicable\r\ncharacter who ought not to be tolerated, yet it is difficult to thwart\r\nhis schemes. The recent opening to settlement of the lands in the\r\nCherokee Outlet, embracing an area of 6,500,000 acres, notwithstanding\r\nthe utmost care in framing the regulations governing the selection of\r\nlocations and notwithstanding the presence of United States troops,\r\nfurnished an exhibition, though perhaps in a modified degree, of the\r\nmad scramble, the violence, and the fraudulent occupation which have\r\naccompanied previous openings of public land.\r\n\r\nI concur with the Secretary in the belief that these outrageous\r\nincidents can not be entirely prevented without a change in the laws on\r\nthe subject, and I hope his recommendations in that direction will be\r\nfavorably considered.\r\n\r\nI especially commend to the attention of the Congress the statements\r\ncontained in the Secretary's report concerning forestry. The time has\r\ncome when efficient measures should be taken for the preservation of\r\nour forests from indiscriminate and remediless destruction.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of Agriculture will be found exceedingly\r\ninteresting, especially to that large part of our citizens intimately\r\nconcerned in agricultural occupations.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th day of March, 1893, there were upon its pay rolls 2,430\r\nemployees. This number has been reduced to 1,850 persons. In view of a\r\ndepleted public Treasury and the imperative demand of the people for\r\neconomy in the administration of their Government, the Secretary has\r\nentered upon the task of rationally reducing expenditures by the\r\nelimination from the pay rolls of all persons not needed for an\r\nefficient conduct of the affairs of the Department.\r\n\r\nDuring the first quarter of the present year the expenses of the\r\nDepartment aggregated $345,876.76, as against $402,012.42 for the\r\ncorresponding period of the fiscal year ending June 30, 1893. The\r\nSecretary makes apparent his intention to continue this rate of\r\nreduction by submitting estimates for the next fiscal year less by\r\n$994,280 than those for the present year.\r\n\r\nAmong the heads of divisions in this Department the changes have been\r\nexceedingly few. Three vacancies occurring from death and resignations\r\nhave been filled by the promotion of assistants in the same divisions.\r\n\r\nThese promotions of experienced and faithful assistants have not only\r\nbeen in the interest of efficient work, but have suggested to those in\r\nthe Department who look for retention and promotion that merit and\r\ndevotion to duty are their best reliance.\r\n\r\nThe amount appropriated for the Bureau of Animal Industry for the\r\ncurrent fiscal year is $850,000. The estimate for the ensuing year is\r\n$700,000.\r\n\r\nThe regulations of 1892 concerning Texas fever have been enforced during\r\nthe last year and the large stock yards of the country have been kept\r\nfree from infection. Occasional local outbreaks have been largely such\r\nas could have been effectually guarded against by the owners of the\r\naffected cattle.\r\n\r\nWhile contagious pleuro-pneumonia in cattle has been eradicated, animal\r\ntuberculosis, a disease widespread and more dangerous to human life than\r\npleuro-pneumonia, is still prevalent. Investigations have been made\r\nduring the past year as to the means of its communication and the method\r\nof its correct diagnosis. Much progress has been made in this direction\r\nby the studies of the division of animal pathology, but work ought to be\r\nextended, in cooperation with local authorities, until the danger to\r\nhuman life arising from this cause is reduced to a minimum.\r\n\r\nThe number of animals arriving from Canada during the year and inspected\r\nby Bureau officers was 462,092, and the number from transatlantic\r\ncountries was 1,297. No contagious diseases were found among the\r\nimported animals.\r\n\r\nThe total number of inspections of cattle for export during the past\r\nfiscal year was 611,542. The exports show a falling off of about 25 per\r\ncent from the preceding year, the decrease occurring entirely in the\r\nlast half of the year. This suggests that the falling off may have been\r\nlargely due to an increase in the price of American export cattle.\r\n\r\nDuring the year ending June 30, 1893, exports of inspected pork\r\naggregated 20,677,410 pounds, as against 38,152,874 pounds for the\r\npreceding year. The falling off in this export was not confined,\r\nhowever, to inspected pork, the total quantity exported for 1892 being\r\n665,490,616 pounds, while in 1893 it was only 527,308,695 pounds.\r\n\r\nI join the Secretary in recommending that hereafter each applicant for\r\nthe position of inspector or assistant inspector in the Bureau of Animal\r\nIndustry be required, as a condition precedent to his appointment, to\r\nexhibit to the United States Civil Service Commission his diploma from\r\nan established, regular, and reputable veterinary college, and that this\r\nbe supplemented by such an examination in veterinary science as the\r\nCommission may prescribe.\r\n\r\nThe exports of agricultural products from the United States for the\r\nfiscal year ending June 30, 1892, attained the enormous figure of\r\n$800,000,000, in round numbers, being 78.7 per cent of our total\r\nexports. In the last fiscal year this aggregate was greatly reduced, but\r\nnevertheless reached 615,000,000, being 75.1 per cent of all American\r\ncommodities exported.\r\n\r\nA review of our agricultural exports with special reference to their\r\ndestination will show that in almost every line the United Kingdom of\r\nGreat Britain and Ireland absorbs by far the largest proportion. Of\r\ncattle the total exports aggregated in value for the fiscal year ending\r\nJune 30, 1893, $26,000,000, of which Great Britain took considerably\r\nover $25,000,000. Of beef products of all kinds our total exports were\r\n$28,000,000, of which Great Britain took $24,000,000. Of pork products\r\nthe total exports were $84,000,000, of which Great Britain took\r\n$53,000,000. In breadstuffs, cotton, and minor products like proportions\r\nsent to the same destination are shown.\r\n\r\nThe work of the statistical division of the Department of Agriculture\r\ndeals with all that relates to the economics of farming.\r\n\r\nThe main purpose of its monthly reports is to keep the farmers informed\r\nas fully as possible of all matters having any influence upon the\r\nworld's markets, in which their products find sale. Its publications\r\nrelate especially to the commercial side of farming.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore of profound importance and vital concern to the farmers\r\nof the United States, who represent nearly one-half of our population,\r\nand also of direct interest to the whole country, that the work of this\r\ndivision be efficiently performed and that the information it has\r\ngathered be promptly diffused.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter for congratulation to know that the Secretary will not\r\nspare any effort to make this part of his work thoroughly useful.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1839 the Congress appropriated $1,000, to be taken from the\r\nPatent Office funds, for the purpose of collecting and distributing\r\nrare and improved varieties of seeds and for prosecuting agricultural\r\ninvestigations and procuring agricultural statistics. From this small\r\nbeginning the seed division of the Department of Agriculture has grown\r\nto its present unwieldy and unjustifiably extravagant proportions.\r\n\r\nDuring the last fiscal year the cost of seeds purchased was $66,548.61.\r\nThe remainder of an appropriation of $135,000 was expended in putting\r\nthem up and distributing them. It surely never could have entered the\r\nminds of those who first sanctioned appropriations of public money for\r\nthe purchase of new and improved varieties of seeds for gratuitous\r\ndistribution that from this would grow large appropriations for the\r\npurchase and distribution by members of Congress of ordinary seeds,\r\nbulbs, and cuttings which are common in all the States and Territories\r\nand everywhere easily obtainable at low prices.\r\n\r\nIn each State and Territory an agricultural experiment station has been\r\nestablished. These stations, by their very character and name, are the\r\nproper agencies to experiment with and test new varieties of seeds; and\r\nyet this indiscriminate and wasteful distribution by legislation and\r\nlegislators continues, answering no purpose unless it be to remind\r\nconstituents that their representatives are willing to remember them\r\nwith gratuities at public cost.\r\n\r\nUnder the sanction of existing legislation there was sent out from the\r\nAgricultural Department during the last fiscal year enough of cabbage\r\nseed to plant 19,200 acres of land, a sufficient quantity of beans to\r\nplant 4,000 acres, beet seed enough to plant 2,500 acres, sweet corn\r\nenough to plant 7,800 acres, sufficient cucumber seed to cover 2,025\r\nacres with vines, and enough muskmelon and watermelon seeds to plant\r\n2,675 acres. The total quantity of flower and vegetable seeds thus\r\ndistributed was contained in more than 9,000,000 packages, and they were\r\nsufficient if planted to cover 89,596 acres of land.\r\n\r\nIn view of these facts this enormous expenditure without legitimate\r\nreturns of benefit ought to be abolished. Anticipating a consummation so\r\nmanifestly in the interest of good administration, more than $100,000\r\nhas been stricken from the estimate made to cover this object for the\r\nyear ending June 30, 1895; and the Secretary recommends that the\r\nremaining $35,000 of the estimate be confined strictly to the purchase\r\nof new and improved varieties of seeds, and that these be distributed\r\nthrough experiment stations.\r\n\r\nThus the seed will be tested, and after the test has been completed by\r\nthe experiment station the propagation of the useful varieties and the\r\nrejection of the valueless may safely be left to the common sense of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThe continued intelligent execution of the civil-service law and the\r\nincreasing approval by the people of its operation are most gratifying.\r\nThe recent extension of its limitations and regulations to the employees\r\nat free-delivery post-offices, which has been honestly and promptly\r\naccomplished by the Commission, with the hearty cooperation of the\r\nPostmaster-General, is an immensely important advance in the usefulness\r\nof the system.\r\n\r\nI am, if possible, more than ever convinced of the incalculable benefits\r\nconferred by the civil-service law, not only in its effect upon the\r\npublic service, but also, what is even more important, in its effect in\r\nelevating the tone of political life generally.\r\n\r\nThe course of civil-service reform in this country instructively and\r\ninterestingly illustrates how strong a hold a movement gains upon our\r\npeople which has underlying it a sentiment of justice and right and\r\nwhich at the same time promises better administration of their\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nThe law embodying this reform found its way to our statute book\r\nmore from fear of the popular sentiment existing in its favor than\r\nfrom any love for the reform itself on the part of legislators, and\r\nit has lived and grown and flourished in spite of the covert as well\r\nas open hostility of spoilsmen and notwithstanding the querulous\r\nimpracticability of many self-constituted guardians. Beneath all\r\nthe vagaries and sublimated theories which are attracted to it there\r\nunderlies this reform a sturdy common-sense principle not only suited to\r\nthis mundane sphere, but whose application our people are more and more\r\nrecognizing to be absolutely essential to the most successful operation\r\nof their Government, if not to its perpetuity.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me to be entirely inconsistent with the character of this\r\nreform, as well as with its best enforcement, to oblige the Commission\r\nto rely for clerical assistance upon clerks detailed from other\r\nDepartments. There ought not to be such a condition in any Department\r\nthat clerks hired to do work there can be spared to habitually work\r\nat another place, and it does not accord with a sensible view of\r\ncivil-service reform that persons should be employed on the theory that\r\ntheir labor is necessary in one Department when in point of fact their\r\nservices are devoted to entirely different work in another Department.\r\n\r\nI earnestly urge that the clerks necessary to carry on the work of the\r\nCommission be regularly put upon its roster and that the system of\r\nobliging the Commissioners to rely upon the services of clerks belonging\r\nto other Departments be discontinued. This ought not to increase the\r\nexpense to the Government, while it would certainly be more consistent\r\nand add greatly to the efficiency of the Commission.\r\n\r\nEconomy in public expenditure is a duty that can not innocently be\r\nneglected by those intrusted with the control of money drawn from the\r\npeople for public uses. It must be confessed that our apparently endless\r\nresources, the familiarity of our people with immense accumulations\r\nof wealth, the growing sentiment among them that the expenditure of\r\npublic money should in some manner be to their immediate and personal\r\nadvantage, the indirect and almost stealthy manner in which a large\r\npart of our taxes is exacted, and a degenerated sense of official\r\naccountability have led to growing extravagance in governmental\r\nappropriations.\r\n\r\nAt this time, when a depleted public Treasury confronts us, when many\r\nof our people are engaged in a hard struggle for the necessaries of\r\nlife, and when enforced economy is pressing upon the great mass of our\r\ncountrymen, I desire to urge with all the earnestness at my command that\r\nCongressional legislation be so limited by strict economy as to exhibit\r\nan appreciation of the condition of the Treasury and a sympathy with the\r\nstraitened circumstances of our fellow-citizens.\r\n\r\nThe duty of public economy is also of immense importance in its intimate\r\nand necessary relation to the task now in hand of providing revenue to\r\nmeet Government expenditures and yet reducing the people's burden of\r\nFederal taxation.\r\n\r\nAfter a hard struggle tariff reform is directly before us. Nothing so\r\nimportant claims our attention and nothing so clearly presents itself as\r\nboth an opportunity and a duty--an opportunity to deserve the gratitude\r\nof our fellow-citizens and a duty imposed upon us by our oft-repeated\r\nprofessions and by the emphatic mandate of the people. After full\r\ndiscussion our countrymen have spoken in favor of this reform, and they\r\nhave confided the work of its accomplishment to the hands of those who\r\nare solemnly pledged to it.\r\n\r\nIf there is anything in the theory of a representation in public places\r\nof the people and their desires, if public officers are really the\r\nservants of the people, and if political promises and professions have\r\nany binding force, our failure to give the relief so long awaited will\r\nbe sheer recreancy. Nothing should intervene to distract our attention\r\nor disturb our effort until this reform is accomplished by wise and\r\ncareful legislation.\r\n\r\nWhile we should stanchly adhere to the principle that only the necessity\r\nof revenue justifies the imposition of tariff duties and other Federal\r\ntaxation and that they should be limited by strict economy, we can not\r\nclose our eyes to the fact that conditions have grown up among us which\r\nin justice and fairness call for discriminating care in the distribution\r\nof such duties and taxation as the emergencies of our Government\r\nactually demand.\r\n\r\nManifestly if we are to aid the people directly through tariff reform,\r\none of its most obvious features should be a reduction in present tariff\r\ncharges upon the necessaries of life. The benefits of such a reduction\r\nwould be palpable and substantial, seen and felt by thousands who would\r\nbe better fed and better clothed and better sheltered. These gifts\r\nshould be the willing benefactions of a Government whose highest\r\nfunction is the promotion of the welfare of the people.\r\n\r\nNot less closely related to our people's prosperity and well-being is\r\nthe removal of restrictions upon the importation of the raw materials\r\nnecessary to our manufactures. The world should be open to our national\r\ningenuity and enterprise. This can not be while Federal legislation\r\nthrough the imposition of high tariff forbids to American manufacturers\r\nas cheap materials as those used by their competitors. It is quite\r\nobvious that the enhancement of the price of our manufactured products\r\nresulting from this policy not only confines the market for these\r\nproducts within our own borders, to the direct disadvantage of our\r\nmanufacturers, but also increases their cost to our citizens.\r\n\r\nThe interests of labor are certainly, though indirectly, involved in\r\nthis feature of our tariff system. The sharp competition and active\r\nstruggle among our manufacturers to supply the limited demand for their\r\ngoods soon fill the narrow market to which they are confined. Then\r\nfollows a suspension of work in mills and factories, a discharge of\r\nemployees, and distress in the homes of our workingmen.\r\n\r\nEven if the often-disproved assertion could be made good that a lower\r\nrate of wages would result from free raw materials and low tariff\r\nduties, the intelligence of our workmen leads them quickly to discover\r\nthat their steady employment, permitted by free raw materials, is the\r\nmost important factor in their relation to tariff legislation.\r\n\r\nA measure has been prepared by the appropriate Congressional committee\r\nembodying tariff reform on the lines herein suggested, which will be\r\npromptly submitted for legislative action. It is the result of much\r\npatriotic and unselfish work, and I believe it deals with its subject\r\nconsistently and as thoroughly as existing conditions permit.\r\n\r\nI am satisfied that the reduced tariff duties provided for in the\r\nproposed legislation, added to existing internal-revenue taxation, will\r\nin the near future, though perhaps not immediately, produce sufficient\r\nrevenue to meet the needs of the Government.\r\n\r\nThe committee, after full consideration and to provide against a\r\ntemporary deficiency which may exist before the business of the country\r\nadjusts itself to the new tariff schedules, have wisely embraced in\r\ntheir plan a few additional internal-revenue taxes, including a small\r\ntax upon incomes derived from certain corporate investments.\r\n\r\nThese new adjustments are not only absolutely just and easily borne, but\r\nthey have the further merit of being such as can be remitted without\r\nunfavorable business disturbance whenever the necessity of their\r\nimposition no longer exists.\r\n\r\nIn my great desire for the success of this measure I can not restrain\r\nthe suggestion that its success can only be attained by means of\r\nunselfish counsel on the part of the friends of tariff reform and as a\r\nresult of their willingness to subordinate personal desires and\r\nambitions to the general good. The local interests affected by the\r\nproposed reform are so numerous and so varied that if all are insisted\r\nupon the legislation embodying the reform must inevitably fail.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion my intense feeling of responsibility impels me to invoke\r\nfor the manifold interests of a generous and confiding people the most\r\nscrupulous care and to pledge my willing support to every legislative\r\neffort for the advancement of the greatness and prosperity of our\r\nbeloved country.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See pp. 377-378.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: See pp. 395-396.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: See Vol. VIII, pp. 353-355.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, December 18, 1893_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn my recent annual message to the Congress I briefly referred to our\r\nrelations with Hawaii and expressed the intention of transmitting\r\nfurther information on the subject when additional advices permitted.\r\n\r\nThough I am not able now to report a definite change in the actual\r\nsituation, I am convinced that the difficulties lately created both\r\nhere and in Hawaii, and now standing in the way of a solution through\r\nExecutive action of the problem presented, render it proper and\r\nexpedient that the matter should be referred to the broader authority\r\nand discretion of Congress, with a full explanation of the endeavor\r\nthus far made to deal with the emergency and a statement of the\r\nconsiderations which have governed my action.\r\n\r\nI suppose that right and justice should determine the path to be\r\nfollowed in treating this subject. If national honesty is to be\r\ndisregarded and a desire for territorial extension or dissatisfaction\r\nwith a form of government not our own ought to regulate our conduct, I\r\nhave entirely misapprehended the mission and character of our Government\r\nand the behavior which the conscience of our people demands of their\r\npublic servants.\r\n\r\nWhen the present Administration entered upon its duties, the Senate\r\nhad under consideration a treaty providing for the annexation of the\r\nHawaiian Islands to the territory of the United States. Surely under our\r\nConstitution and laws the enlargement of our limits is a manifestation\r\nof the highest attribute of sovereignty, and if entered upon as an\r\nExecutive act all things relating to the transaction should be clear and\r\nfree from suspicion. Additional importance attached to this particular\r\ntreaty of annexation because it contemplated a departure from unbroken\r\nAmerican tradition in providing for the addition to our territory of\r\nislands of the sea more than 2,000 miles removed from our nearest coast.\r\n\r\nThese considerations might not of themselves call for interference with\r\nthe completion of a treaty entered upon by a previous Administration,\r\nbut it appeared from the documents accompanying the treaty when\r\nsubmitted to the Senate that the ownership of Hawaii was tendered to us\r\nby a Provisional Government set up to succeed the constitutional ruler\r\nof the islands, who had been dethroned, and it did not appear that such\r\nProvisional Government had the sanction of either popular revolution or\r\nsuffrage. Two other remarkable features of the transaction naturally\r\nattracted attention. One was the extraordinary haste, not to say\r\nprecipitancy, characterizing all the transactions connected with the\r\ntreaty. It appeared that a so-called committee of safety, ostensibly the\r\nsource of the revolt against the constitutional Government of Hawaii,\r\nwas organized on Saturday, the 14th day of January; that on Monday, the\r\n16th, the United States forces were landed at Honolulu from a naval\r\nvessel lying in its harbor; that on the 17th the scheme of a Provisional\r\nGovernment was perfected, and a proclamation naming its officers was\r\non the same day prepared and read at the Government building; that\r\nimmediately thereupon the United States minister recognized the\r\nProvisional Government thus created; that two days afterwards, on the\r\n19th day of January, commissioners representing such Government sailed\r\nfor this country in a steamer especially chartered for the occasion,\r\narriving in San Francisco on the 28th day of January and in Washington\r\non the 3d day of February; that on the next day they had their first\r\ninterview with the Secretary of State, and another on the 11th, when the\r\ntreaty of annexation was practically agreed upon, and that on the 14th\r\nit was formally concluded and on the 15th transmitted to the Senate.\r\nThus between the initiation of the scheme for a Provisional Government\r\nin Hawaii, on the 14th day of January, and the submission to the Senate\r\nof the treaty of annexation concluded with such Government the entire\r\ninterval was thirty-two days, fifteen of which were spent by the\r\nHawaiian commissioners in their journey to Washington.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, upon the face of the papers submitted with the treaty\r\nit clearly appeared that there was open and undetermined an issue of\r\nfact of the most vital importance. The message of the President\r\naccompanying the treaty[4] declared that \"the overthrow of the monarchy\r\nwas not in any way promoted by this Government,\" and in a letter to the\r\nPresident from the Secretary of State, also submitted to the Senate with\r\nthe treaty, the following passage occurs:\r\n\r\n  At the time the Provisional Government took possession of the Government\r\n  buildings no troops or officers of the United States were present or\r\n  took any part whatever in the proceedings. No public recognition was\r\n  accorded to the Provisional Government by the United States minister\r\n  until after the Queen's abdication and when they were in effective\r\n  possession of the Government buildings, the archives, the treasury, the\r\n  barracks, the police station, and all the potential machinery of the\r\n  Government.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut a protest also accompanied said treaty, signed by the Queen and her\r\nministers at the time she made way for the Provisional Government, which\r\nexplicitly stated that she yielded to the superior force of the United\r\nStates, whose minister had caused United States troops to be landed at\r\nHonolulu and declared that he would support such Provisional Government.\r\n\r\nThe truth or falsity of this protest was surely of the first importance.\r\nIf true, nothing but the concealment of its truth could induce our\r\nGovernment to negotiate with the semblance of a government thus created,\r\nnor could a treaty resulting from the acts stated in the protest have\r\nbeen knowingly deemed worthy of consideration by the Senate. Yet the\r\ntruth or falsity of the protest had not been investigated.\r\n\r\nI conceived it to be my duty, therefore, to withdraw the treaty from the\r\nSenate for examination, and meanwhile to cause an accurate, full, and\r\nimpartial investigation to be made of the facts attending the subversion\r\nof the constitutional Government of Hawaii and the installment in\r\nits place of the Provisional Government. I selected for the work of\r\ninvestigation the Hon. James H. Blount, of Georgia, whose service of\r\neighteen years as a member of the House of Representatives and whose\r\nexperience as chairman of the Committee of Foreign Affairs in that body,\r\nand his consequent familiarity with international topics, joined with\r\nhis high character and honorable reputation, seemed to render him\r\npeculiarly fitted for the duties intrusted to him. His report detailing\r\nhis action under the instructions given to him and the conclusions\r\nderived from his investigation accompany this message.\r\n\r\nThese conclusions do not rest for their acceptance entirely upon\r\nMr. Blount's honesty and ability as a man, nor upon his acumen and\r\nimpartiality as an investigator. They are accompanied by the evidence\r\nupon which they are based, which evidence is also herewith transmitted,\r\nand from which it seems to me no other deductions could possibly be\r\nreached than those arrived at by the commissioner.\r\n\r\nThe report, with its accompanying proofs and such other evidence as is\r\nnow before the Congress or is herewith submitted, justifies, in my\r\nopinion, the statement that when the President was led to submit the\r\ntreaty to the Senate with the declaration that \"the overthrow of the\r\nmonarchy was not in any way promoted by this Government,\" and when the\r\nSenate was induced to receive and discuss it on that basis, both\r\nPresident and Senate were misled.\r\n\r\nThe attempt will not be made in this communication to touch upon all\r\nthe facts which throw light upon the progress and consummation of this\r\nscheme of annexation. A very brief and imperfect reference to the facts\r\nand evidence at hand will exhibit its character and the incidents in\r\nwhich it had its birth.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to set forth the reasons which in January, 1893, led\r\na considerable proportion of American and other foreign merchants and\r\ntraders residing at Honolulu to favor the annexation of Hawaii to the\r\nUnited States. It is sufficient to note the fact and to observe that\r\nthe project was one which was zealously promoted by the minister\r\nrepresenting the United States in that country. He evidently had an\r\nardent desire that it should become a fact accomplished by his agency\r\nand during his ministry, and was not inconveniently scrupulous as to the\r\nmeans employed to that end. On the 19th day of November, 1892, nearly\r\ntwo months before the first overt act tending toward the subversion of\r\nthe Hawaiian Government and the attempted transfer of Hawaiian territory\r\nto the United States, he addressed a long letter to the Secretary of\r\nState, in which the case for annexation was elaborately argued on moral,\r\npolitical, and economical grounds. He refers to the loss to the Hawaiian\r\nsugar interests from the operation of the McKinley bill and the tendency\r\nto still further depreciation of sugar property unless some positive\r\nmeasure of relief is granted. He strongly inveighs against the existing\r\nHawaiian Government and emphatically declares for annexation. He says:\r\n\r\n  In truth, the monarchy here is an absurd anachronism. It has nothing on\r\n  which it logically or legitimately stands. The feudal basis on which it\r\n  once stood no longer existing, the monarchy now is only an impediment to\r\n  good government--an obstruction to the prosperity and progress of the\r\n  islands.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe further says:\r\n\r\n  As a Crown colony of Great Britain or a Territory of the United States\r\n  the government modifications could be made readily and good\r\n  administration of the law secured. Destiny and the vast future interests\r\n  of the United States in the Pacific clearly indicate who at no distant\r\n  day must be responsible for the government of these islands. Under a\r\n  Territorial government they could be as easily governed as any of the\r\n  existing Territories of the United States. * * * Hawaii has reached\r\n  the parting of the ways. She must now take the road which leads to Asia,\r\n  or the other, which outlets her in America, gives her an American\r\n  civilization, and binds her to the care of American destiny.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe also declares:\r\n\r\n  One of two courses seems to me absolutely necessary to be\r\n  followed--either bold and vigorous measures for annexation or a \"customs\r\n  union,\" an ocean cable from the Californian coast to Honolulu, Pearl\r\n  Harbor perpetually ceded to the United States, with an implied but not\r\n  expressly stipulated American protectorate over the islands. I believe\r\n  the former to be the better, that which will prove much the more\r\n  advantageous to the islands and the cheapest and least embarrassing in\r\n  the end to the United States. If it was wise for the United States,\r\n  through Secretary Marcy, thirty-eight years ago, to offer to expend\r\n  $100,000 to secure a treaty of annexation, it certainly can not be\r\n  chimerical or unwise to expend $100,000 to secure annexation in the near\r\n  future. To-day the United States has five times the wealth she possessed\r\n  in 1854, and the reasons now existing for annexation are much stronger\r\n  than they were then. I can not refrain from expressing the opinion with\r\n  emphasis that the golden hour is near at hand.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese declarations certainly show a disposition and condition of mind\r\nwhich may be usefully recalled when interpreting the significance of the\r\nminister's conceded acts or when considering the probabilities of such\r\nconduct on his part as may not be admitted.\r\n\r\nIn this view it seems proper to also quote from a letter written by the\r\nminister to the Secretary of State on the 8th day of March, 1892, nearly\r\na year prior to the first step taken toward annexation. After stating\r\nthe possibility that the existing Government of Hawaii might be\r\noverturned by an orderly and peaceful revolution, Minister Stevens\r\nwrites as follows:\r\n\r\n  Ordinarily, in like circumstances, the rule seems to be to limit the\r\n  landing and movement of United States forces in foreign waters and\r\n  dominion exclusively to the protection of the United States legation\r\n  and of the lives and property of American citizens; but as the relations\r\n  of the United States to Hawaii are exceptional, and in former years\r\n  the United States officials here took somewhat exceptional action in\r\n  circumstances of disorder, I desire to know how far the present minister\r\n  and naval commander may deviate from established international rules\r\n  and precedents in the contingencies indicated in the first part of this\r\n  dispatch.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo a minister of this temper, full of zeal for annexation, there seemed\r\nto arise in January, 1893, the precise opportunity for which he was\r\nwatchfully waiting--an opportunity which by timely \"deviation from\r\nestablished international rules and precedents\" might be improved to\r\nsuccessfully accomplish the great object in view; and we are quite\r\nprepared for the exultant enthusiasm with which, in a letter to the\r\nState Department dated February 1, 1893, he declares:\r\n\r\n  The Hawaiian pear is now fully ripe, and this is the golden hour for\r\n  the United States to pluck it.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a further illustration of the activity of this diplomatic\r\nrepresentative, attention is called to the fact that on the day the\r\nabove letter was written, apparently unable longer to restrain his\r\nardor, he issued a proclamation whereby, \"in the name of the United\r\nStates,\" he assumed the protection of the Hawaiian Islands and declared\r\nthat said action was \"taken pending and subject to negotiations at\r\nWashington.\" Of course this assumption of a protectorate was promptly\r\ndisavowed by our Government, but the American flag remained over the\r\nGovernment building at Honolulu and the forces remained on guard until\r\nApril, and after Mr. Blount's arrival on the scene, when both were\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\nA brief statement of the occurrences that led to the subversion of the\r\nconstitutional Government of Hawaii in the interests of annexation to\r\nthe United States will exhibit the true complexion of that transaction.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, January 14, 1893, the Queen of Hawaii, who had been\r\ncontemplating the proclamation of a new constitution, had, in deference\r\nto the wishes and remonstrances of her cabinet, renounced the project\r\nfor the present at least. Taking this relinquished purpose as a basis\r\nof action, citizens of Honolulu numbering from fifty to one hundred,\r\nmostly resident aliens, met in a private office and selected a so-called\r\ncommittee of safety, composed of thirteen persons, seven of whom were\r\nforeign subjects, and consisted of five Americans, one Englishman,\r\nand one German. This committee, though its designs were not revealed,\r\nhad in view nothing less than annexation to the United States, and\r\nbetween Saturday, the 14th, and the following Monday, the 16th of\r\nJanuary--though exactly what action was taken may not be clearly\r\ndisclosed--they were certainly in communication with the United States\r\nminister. On Monday morning the Queen and her cabinet made public\r\nproclamation, with a notice which was specially served upon the\r\nrepresentatives of all foreign governments, that any changes in the\r\nconstitution would be sought only in the methods provided by that\r\ninstrument. Nevertheless, at the call and under the auspices of the\r\ncommittee of safety, a mass meeting of citizens was held on that day to\r\nprotest against the Queen's alleged illegal and unlawful proceedings and\r\npurposes. Even at this meeting the committee of safety continued to\r\ndisguise their real purpose and contented themselves with procuring\r\nthe passage of a resolution denouncing the Queen and empowering the\r\ncommittee to devise ways and means \"to secure the permanent maintenance\r\nof law and order and the protection of life, liberty, and property\r\nin Hawaii.\" This meeting adjourned between 3 and 4 o'clock in the\r\nafternoon. On the same day, and immediately after such adjournment, the\r\ncommittee, unwilling to take further steps without the cooperation of\r\nthe United States minister, addressed him a note representing that the\r\npublic safety was menaced and that lives and property were in danger,\r\nand concluded as follows:\r\n\r\n  We are unable to protect ourselves without aid, and therefore pray for\r\n  the protection of the United States forces.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhatever may be thought of the other contents of this note, the absolute\r\ntruth of this latter statement is incontestable. When the note was\r\nwritten and delivered the committee, so far as it appears, had neither\r\na man nor a gun at their command, and after its delivery they became so\r\npanic-stricken at their position that they sent some of their number to\r\ninterview the minister and request him not to land the United States\r\nforces till the next morning. But he replied that the troops had been\r\nordered and whether the committee were ready or not the landing should\r\ntake place. And so it happened that on the 16th day of January, 1893,\r\nbetween 4 and 5 o'clock in the afternoon, a detachment of marines from\r\nthe United States steamer _Boston_, with two pieces of artillery,\r\nlanded at Honolulu. The men, upward of 160 in all, were supplied with\r\ndouble cartridge belts filled with ammunition and with haversacks and\r\ncanteens, and were accompanied by a hospital corps with stretchers and\r\nmedical supplies.\r\n\r\nThis military demonstration upon the soil of Honolulu was of itself an\r\nact of war, unless made either with the consent of the Government of\r\nHawaii or for the _bona fide_ purpose of protecting the imperiled\r\nlives and property of citizens of the United States. But there is no\r\npretense of any such consent on the part of the Government of the Queen,\r\nwhich at that time was undisputed and was both the _de facto_ and\r\nthe _de jure_ Government. In point of fact the existing Government,\r\ninstead of requesting the presence of an armed force, protested against\r\nit. There is as little basis for the pretense that such forces were\r\nlanded for the security of American life and property. If so, they would\r\nhave been stationed in the vicinity of such property and so as to\r\nprotect it, instead of at a distance and so as to command the Hawaiian\r\nGovernment building and palace. Admiral Skerrett, the officer in command\r\nof our naval force on the Pacific station, has frankly stated that in\r\nhis opinion the location of the troops was inadvisable if they were\r\nlanded for the protection of American citizens, whose residences and\r\nplaces of business, as well as the legation and consulate, were in a\r\ndistant part of the city; but the location selected was a wise one if\r\nthe forces were landed for the purpose of supporting the Provisional\r\nGovernment. If any peril to life and property calling for any such\r\nmartial array had existed, Great Britain and other foreign powers\r\ninterested would not have been behind the United States in activity to\r\nprotect their citizens. But they made no sign in that direction. When\r\nthese armed men were landed the city of Honolulu was in its customary\r\norderly and peaceful condition. There was no symptom of riot or\r\ndisturbance in any quarter. Men, women, and children were about the\r\nstreets as usual, and nothing varied the ordinary routine or disturbed\r\nthe ordinary tranquillity except the landing of the _Boston's_\r\nmarines and their march through the town to the quarters assigned them.\r\nIndeed, the fact that after having called for the landing of the United\r\nStates forces on the plea of danger to life and property the committee\r\nof safety themselves requested the minister to postpone action exposed\r\nthe untruthfulness of their representations of present peril to life and\r\nproperty. The peril they saw was an anticipation growing out of guilty\r\nintentions on their part and something which, though not then existing,\r\nthey knew would certainly follow their attempt to overthrow the\r\nGovernment of the Queen without the aid of the United States forces.\r\n\r\nThus it appears that Hawaii was taken possession of by the United States\r\nforces without the consent or wish of the Government of the islands,\r\nor of anybody else so far as shown except the United States minister.\r\nTherefore the military occupation of Honolulu by the United States\r\non the day mentioned was wholly without justification, either as an\r\noccupation by consent or as an occupation necessitated by dangers\r\nthreatening American life and property. It must be accounted for in some\r\nother way and on some other ground, and its real motive and purpose are\r\nneither obscure nor far to seek.\r\n\r\nThe United States forces being now on the scene and favorably\r\nstationed, the committee proceeded to carry out their original scheme.\r\nThey met the next morning, Tuesday, the 17th, perfected the plan of\r\ntemporary government, and fixed upon its principal officers, ten of whom\r\nwere drawn from the thirteen members of the committee of safety. Between\r\n1 and 2 o'clock, by squads and by different routes to avoid notice, and\r\nhaving first taken the precaution of ascertaining whether there was\r\nanyone there to oppose them, they proceeded to the Government building\r\nto proclaim the new Government. No sign of opposition was manifest, and\r\nthereupon an American citizen began to read the proclamation from the\r\nsteps of the Government building, almost entirely without auditors.\r\nIt is said that before the reading was finished quite a concourse of\r\npersons, variously estimated at from 50 to 100, some armed and some\r\nunarmed, gathered about the committee to give them aid and confidence.\r\nThis statement is not important, since the one controlling factor in the\r\nwhole affair was unquestionably the United States marines, who, drawn\r\nup under arms and with artillery in readiness only 76 yards distant,\r\ndominated the situation.\r\n\r\nThe Provisional Government thus proclaimed was by the terms of the\r\nproclamation \"to exist until terms of union with the United States had\r\nbeen negotiated and agreed upon.\" The United States minister, pursuant\r\nto prior agreement, recognized this Government within an hour after the\r\nreading of the proclamation, and before 5 o'clock, in answer to an\r\ninquiry on behalf of the Queen and her cabinet, announced that he had\r\ndone so.\r\n\r\nWhen our minister recognized the Provisional Government, the only basis\r\nupon which it rested was the fact that the committee of safety had in\r\nthe manner above stated declared it to exist. It was neither a\r\ngovernment _de facto_ nor _de jure_. That it was not in such possession\r\nof the Government property and agencies as entitled it to recognition is\r\nconclusively proved by a note found in the files of the legation at\r\nHonolulu, addressed by the declared head of the Provisional Government\r\nto Minister Stevens, dated January 17, 1893, in which he acknowledges\r\nwith expressions of appreciation the minister's recognition of the\r\nProvisional Government, and states that it is not yet in the possession\r\nof the station house (the place where a large number of the Queen's\r\ntroops were quartered), though the same had been demanded of the Queen's\r\nofficers in charge. Nevertheless, this wrongful recognition by our\r\nminister placed the Government of the Queen in a position of most\r\nperilous perplexity. On the one hand she had possession of the palace,\r\nof the barracks, and of the police station, and had at her command at\r\nleast 500 fully armed men and several pieces of artillery. Indeed, the\r\nwhole military force of her Kingdom was on her side and at her disposal,\r\nwhile the committee of safety, by actual search, had discovered that\r\nthere were but very few arms in Honolulu that were not in the service of\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\nIn this state of things, if the Queen could have dealt with the\r\ninsurgents alone, her course would have been plain and the result\r\nunmistakable. But the United States had allied itself with her enemies,\r\nhad recognized them as the true Government of Hawaii, and had put\r\nher and her adherents in the position of opposition against lawful\r\nauthority. She knew that she could not withstand the power of the United\r\nStates, but she believed that she might safely trust to its justice.\r\nAccordingly, some hours after the recognition of the Provisional\r\nGovernment by the United States minister, the palace, the barracks, and\r\nthe police station, with all the military resources of the country, were\r\ndelivered up by the Queen upon the representation made to her that her\r\ncause would thereafter be reviewed at Washington, and while protesting\r\nthat she surrendered to the superior force of the United States, whose\r\nminister had caused United States troops to be landed at Honolulu and\r\ndeclared that he would support the Provisional Government, and that she\r\nyielded her authority to prevent collision of armed forces and loss of\r\nlife, and only until such time as the United States, upon the facts\r\nbeing presented to it, should undo the action of its representative and\r\nreinstate her in the authority she claimed as the constitutional\r\nsovereign of the Hawaiian Islands.\r\n\r\nThis protest was delivered to the chief of the Provisional Government,\r\nwho indorsed thereon his acknowledgment of its receipt. The terms of the\r\nprotest were read without dissent by those assuming to constitute the\r\nProvisional Government, who were certainly charged with the knowledge\r\nthat the Queen, instead of finally abandoning her power, had appealed to\r\nthe justice of the United States for reinstatement in her authority; and\r\nyet the Provisional Government, with this unanswered protest in its\r\nhand, hastened to negotiate with the United States for the permanent\r\nbanishment of the Queen from power and for a sale of her Kingdom.\r\n\r\nOur country was in danger of occupying the position of having actually\r\nset up a temporary government on foreign soil for the purpose of\r\nacquiring through that agency territory which we had wrongfully put in\r\nits possession. The control of both sides of a bargain acquired in such\r\na manner is called by a familiar and unpleasant name when found in\r\nprivate transactions. We are not without a precedent showing how\r\nscrupulously we avoided such accusations in former days. After the\r\npeople of Texas had declared their independence of Mexico they resolved\r\nthat on the acknowledgment of their independence by the United States\r\nthey would seek admission into the Union. Several months after the\r\nbattle of San Jacinto, by which Texan independence was practically\r\nassured and established, President Jackson declined to recognize it,\r\nalleging as one of his reasons that in the circumstances it became us\r\n\"to beware of a too early movement, as it might subject us, however\r\nunjustly, to the imputation of seeking to establish the claim of our\r\nneighbors to a territory with a view to its subsequent acquisition by\r\nourselves.\" This is in marked contrast with the hasty recognition of a\r\ngovernment openly and concededly set up for the purpose of tendering to\r\nus territorial annexation.\r\n\r\nI believe that a candid and thorough examination of the facts will force\r\nthe conviction that the Provisional Government owes its existence to\r\nan armed invasion by the United States. Fair-minded people, with the\r\nevidence before them, will hardly claim that the Hawaiian Government\r\nwas overthrown by the people of the islands or that the Provisional\r\nGovernment had ever existed with their consent. I do not understand that\r\nany member of this Government claims that the people would uphold it by\r\ntheir suffrages if they were allowed to vote on the question.\r\n\r\nWhile naturally sympathizing with every effort to establish a republican\r\nform of government, it has been the settled policy of the United States\r\nto concede to people of foreign countries the same freedom and\r\nindependence in the management of their domestic affairs that we have\r\nalways claimed for ourselves, and it has been our practice to recognize\r\nrevolutionary governments as soon as it became apparent that they were\r\nsupported by the people. For illustration of this rule I need only to\r\nrefer to the revolution in Brazil in 1889, when our minister was\r\ninstructed to recognize the Republic \"so soon as a majority of the\r\npeople of Brazil should have signified their assent to its establishment\r\nand maintenance;\" to the revolution in Chile in 1891, when our minister\r\nwas directed to recognize the new Government \"if it was accepted by the\r\npeople,\" and to the revolution in Venezuela in 1892, when our\r\nrecognition was accorded on condition that the new Government was \"fully\r\nestablished, in possession of the power of the nation, and accepted by\r\nthe people.\"\r\n\r\nAs I apprehend the situation, we are brought face to face with the\r\nfollowing conditions:\r\n\r\nThe lawful Government of Hawaii was overthrown without the drawing of a\r\nsword or the firing of a shot by a process every step of which, it may\r\nsafely be asserted, is directly traceable to and dependent for its\r\nsuccess upon the agency of the United States acting through its\r\ndiplomatic and naval representatives.\r\n\r\nBut for the notorious predilections of the United States minister for\r\nannexation the committee of safety, which should be called the committee\r\nof annexation, would never have existed.\r\n\r\nBut for the landing of the United States forces upon false pretexts\r\nrespecting the danger to life and property the committee would never\r\nhave exposed themselves to the pains and penalties of treason by\r\nundertaking the subversion of the Queen's Government.\r\n\r\nBut for the presence of the United States forces in the immediate\r\nvicinity and in position to afford all needed protection and support the\r\ncommittee would not have proclaimed the Provisional Government from the\r\nsteps of the Government building.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, but for the lawless occupation of Honolulu under false\r\npretexts by the United States forces, and but for Minister Stevens's\r\nrecognition of the Provisional Government when the United States forces\r\nwere its sole support and constituted its only military strength, the\r\nQueen and her Government would never have yielded to the Provisional\r\nGovernment, even for a time and for the sole purpose of submitting her\r\ncase to the enlightened justice of the United States.\r\n\r\nBelieving, therefore, that the United States could not, under the\r\ncircumstances disclosed, annex the islands without justly incurring the\r\nimputation of acquiring them by unjustifiable methods, I shall not again\r\nsubmit the treaty of annexation to the Senate for its consideration, and\r\nin the instructions to Minister Willis, a copy of which accompanies this\r\nmessage, I have directed him to so inform the Provisional Government.\r\n\r\nBut in the present instance our duty does not, in my opinion, end with\r\nrefusing to consummate this questionable transaction. It has been the\r\nboast of our Government that it seeks to do justice in all things\r\nwithout regard to the strength or weakness of those with whom it deals.\r\nI mistake the American people if they favor the odious doctrine that\r\nthere is no such thing as international morality; that there is one law\r\nfor a strong nation and another for a weak one, and that even by\r\nindirection a strong power may with impunity despoil a weak one of its\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\nBy an act of war, committed with the participation of a diplomatic\r\nrepresentative of the United States and without authority of Congress,\r\nthe Government of a feeble but friendly and confiding people has been\r\noverthrown. A substantial wrong has thus been done which a due regard\r\nfor our national character as well as the rights of the injured people\r\nrequires we should endeavor to repair. The Provisional Government has\r\nnot assumed a republican or other constitutional form, but has remained\r\na mere executive council or oligarchy, set up without the assent of the\r\npeople. It has not sought to find a permanent basis of popular support\r\nand has given no evidence of an intention to do so. Indeed, the\r\nrepresentatives of that Government assert that the people of Hawaii are\r\nunfit for popular government and frankly avow that they can be best\r\nruled by arbitrary or despotic power.\r\n\r\nThe law of nations is founded upon reason and justice, and the rules of\r\nconduct governing individual relations between citizens or subjects of a\r\ncivilized state are equally applicable as between enlightened nations.\r\n\r\nThe considerations that international law is without a court for its\r\nenforcement and that obedience to its commands practically depends upon\r\ngood faith instead of upon the mandate of a superior tribunal only\r\ngive additional sanction to the law itself and brand any deliberate\r\ninfraction of it not merely as a wrong, but as a disgrace. A man of\r\ntrue honor protects the unwritten word which binds his conscience more\r\nscrupulously, if possible, than he does the bond a breach of which\r\nsubjects him to legal liabilities, and the United States, in aiming to\r\nmaintain itself as one of the most enlightened nations, would do its\r\ncitizens gross injustice if it applied to its international relations\r\nany other than a high standard of honor and morality. On that ground the\r\nUnited States can not properly be put in the position of countenancing a\r\nwrong after its commission any more than in that of consenting to it in\r\nadvance. On that ground it can not allow itself to refuse to redress an\r\ninjury inflicted through an abuse of power by officers clothed with its\r\nauthority and wearing its uniform; and on the same ground, if a feeble\r\nbut friendly state is in danger of being robbed of its independence and\r\nits sovereignty by a misuse of the name and power of the United States,\r\nthe United States can not fail to vindicate its honor and its sense of\r\njustice by an earnest effort to make all possible reparation.\r\n\r\nThese principles apply to the present case with irresistible force when\r\nthe special conditions of the Queen's surrender of her sovereignty are\r\nrecalled. She surrendered, not to the Provisional Government, but to\r\nthe United States. She surrendered, not absolutely and permanently, but\r\ntemporarily and conditionally until such time as the facts could be\r\nconsidered by the United States. Furthermore, the Provisional Government\r\nacquiesced in her surrender in that manner and on those terms, not only\r\nby tacit consent, but through the positive acts of some members of that\r\nGovernment, who urged her peaceable submission, not merely to avoid\r\nbloodshed, but because she could place implicit reliance upon the\r\njustice of the United States and that the whole subject would be finally\r\nconsidered at Washington.\r\n\r\nI have not, however, overlooked an incident of this unfortunate affair\r\nwhich remains to be mentioned. The members of the Provisional Government\r\nand their supporters, though not entitled to extreme sympathy, have been\r\nled to their present predicament of revolt against the Government of the\r\nQueen by the indefensible encouragement and assistance of our diplomatic\r\nrepresentative. This fact may entitle them to claim that in our effort\r\nto rectify the wrong committed some regard should be had for their\r\nsafety. This sentiment is strongly seconded by my anxiety to do nothing\r\nwhich would invite either harsh retaliation on the part of the Queen or\r\nviolence and bloodshed in any quarter. In the belief that the Queen,\r\nas well as her enemies, would be willing to adopt such a course as\r\nwould meet these conditions, and in view of the fact that both the Queen\r\nand the Provisional Government had at one time apparently acquiesced\r\nin a reference of the entire case to the United States Government,\r\nand considering the further fact that in any event the Provisional\r\nGovernment by its own declared limitation was only \"to exist until terms\r\nof union with the United States of America have been negotiated and\r\nagreed upon,\" I hoped that after the assurance to the members of that\r\nGovernment that such union could not be consummated I might compass a\r\npeaceful adjustment of the difficulty.\r\n\r\nActuated by these desires and purposes, and not unmindful of the\r\ninherent perplexities of the situation nor of the limitations upon\r\nmy power, I instructed Minister Willis to advise the Queen and her\r\nsupporters of my desire to aid in the restoration of the status existing\r\nbefore the lawless landing of the United States forces at Honolulu on\r\nthe 16th of January last if such restoration could be effected upon\r\nterms providing for clemency as well as justice to all parties\r\nconcerned. The conditions suggested, as the instructions show,\r\ncontemplate a general amnesty to those concerned in setting up the\r\nProvisional Government and a recognition of all its _bona fide_\r\nacts and obligations. In short, they require that the past should be\r\nburied and that the restored Government should reassume its authority as\r\nif its continuity had not been interrupted. These conditions have not\r\nproved acceptable to the Queen, and though she has been informed that\r\nthey will be insisted upon and that unless acceded to the efforts of the\r\nPresident to aid in the restoration of her Government will cease, I have\r\nnot thus far learned that she is willing to yield them her acquiescence.\r\nThe check which my plans have thus encountered has prevented their\r\npresentation to the members of the Provisional Government, while\r\nunfortunate public misrepresentations of the situation and exaggerated\r\nstatements of the sentiments of our people have obviously injured the\r\nprospects of successful Executive mediation.\r\n\r\nI therefore submit this communication, with its accompanying exhibits,\r\nembracing Mr. Blount's report, the evidence and statements taken by him\r\nat Honolulu, the instructions given to both Mr. Blount and Minister\r\nWillis, and correspondence connected with the affair in hand.\r\n\r\nIn commending this subject to the extended powers and wide discretion of\r\nthe Congress I desire to add the assurance that I shall be much\r\ngratified to cooperate in any legislative plan which may be devised for\r\nthe solution of the problem before us which is consistent with American\r\nhonor, integrity, and morality.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: See pp. 348-349.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, December 18, 1893_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution passed by the Senate on the 6th instant,\r\nI hereby transmit reports of the Secretaries of State and of the Navy,\r\nwith copies of all instructions given to the respective diplomatic and\r\nnaval representatives of the United States in the Hawaiian Islands since\r\nthe 4th day of March, 1881, touching the matters specified in the\r\nresolution.\r\n\r\nIt has seemed convenient to include in the present communication to the\r\nSenate copies of the diplomatic correspondence concerning the political\r\ncondition of Hawaii, prepared for transmission to the House of\r\nRepresentatives in response to a later resolution passed by that body on\r\nthe 13th instant.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, December 18, 1893_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution passed by your honorable body on the\r\n13th instant, I hereby transmit a report of the Secretary of State,\r\nwith copies of the instructions given to Mr. Albert S.

The successors of these officers oppose the\r\npresent bill on the ground that in its operation it would open the door\r\nto fraud and to a perversion of the intentions of the Government in\r\nrelation to the public lands.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult, with the most scrupulous care, to guard the alienation\r\nof our public lands from fraud and illegal practices. It is perfectly\r\nplain, however, that the prospect of accomplishing this result is better\r\nunder present laws, which require the necessary proofs to be made before\r\nland officers who are appointed for that purpose and who are under the\r\ncontrol of the General Land Office and amenable to its regulations, than\r\nit would be by substituting other officers over whom the Land Office has\r\nno control.\r\n\r\nCertain rules and orders of the Land Office are now in force which\r\nregulate the taking of the necessary proofs and permit oral examinations\r\nby registers and receivers. These regulations are of the utmost\r\nimportance if our land laws are to be justly and honestly administered.\r\n\r\nI fully concur in the objections made to this bill by the officers\r\nhaving charge of the public lands in the last Administration and by\r\ntheir successors who are now charged with that responsibility. I am\r\nconvinced that such a relaxation of our existing land laws as is\r\ncontemplated by the bill under consideration would not be in the\r\ninterest of good administration.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 20, 1894_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI hereby return without my approval House bill No. 3289, entitled\r\n\"An act to authorize the New York and New Jersey Bridge Companies\r\nto construct and maintain a bridge across the Hudson River between\r\nNew York City and the State of New Jersey.\"\r\n\r\nThis bill authorizes the construction of a bridge over the North River\r\nbetween the States of New York and New Jersey, the terminus of which\r\nin the city of New York shall not be below Sixty-sixth street. It\r\ncontemplates the construction of a bridge upon piers placed in the\r\nriver. No mention is made of a single span crossing the entire river,\r\nnor is there anything in the bill indicating that it was within the\r\nintention of the Congress that there should be a bridge built without\r\npiers. I am by no means certain that the Secretary of War, who is\r\ninvested by the terms of the bill with considerable discretion so far as\r\nthe plans for the structure are concerned, would have the right to exact\r\nof the promoters of this enterprise the erection of a bridge spanning\r\nthe entire river.\r\n\r\nMuch objection has been made to the location of any piers in the river\r\nfor the reason that they would seriously interfere with the commerce\r\nwhich seeks the port of New York through that channel. It is certainly\r\nvery questionable whether piers should be permitted at all in the North\r\nRiver at the point designated for the location of this bridge. It seems\r\nabsolutely certain that within a few years a great volume of shipping\r\nwill extend to that location, which would be seriously embarrassed by\r\nsuch obstruction.\r\n\r\nI appreciate fully the importance of securing some means by which\r\nrailroad traffic can cross this river, and no one can fail to realize\r\nthe serious inconvenience to travel caused by lack of facilities of\r\nthat character. At the same time, it is a plain dictate of wisdom and\r\nexpediency that the commerce of the river be not unnecessarily\r\ninterfered with by bridges or in any other manner.\r\n\r\nEngineers whose judgment upon the matter can not be questioned,\r\nincluding the engineer of the company proposing to build this bridge,\r\nhave expressed the opinion that the entire river can be spanned safely\r\nand effectively by a suspension bridge, or a construction not needing\r\nthe use of piers.\r\n\r\nThe company to which the permission to bridge the river is granted in\r\nthe bill under consideration was created by virtue of an act of the\r\nlegislature of the State of New York which became a law, by reason of\r\nthe failure of the governor to either approve or veto the same, on the\r\n30th day of April, 1890. It may be safely assumed that the members of\r\nthe legislature which passed this law knew what was necessary for the\r\nprotection of the commerce of the city of New York and had informed\r\nthemselves concerning the plan of a bridge that should be built in view\r\nof all the interests concerned.\r\n\r\nBy paragraph 24 of the law creating this company it is provided that\r\n\"the said bridge shall be constructed with a single span over the entire\r\nriver between towers or piers located between the span and the existing\r\npier-head lines in either State,\" and that \"no pier or tower or other\r\nobstruction of a permanent character shall be placed or built in the\r\nriver between said towers or piers under this act.\"\r\n\r\nIn view of such professional judgment, and considering the interests\r\nwhich would be interfered with by the location of piers in the river,\r\nand having due regard to the judgment of the legislature of the State\r\nof New York, it seems to me that a plan necessitating the use of piers\r\nin the bed of the river should be avoided. The question of increased\r\nexpense of construction or the compromise of conflicting interests\r\nshould not outweigh the other important considerations involved.\r\n\r\nI notice the bill provides that the companies availing themselves of\r\nits privileges shall receive no greater pay for transporting the mails\r\nacross the bridge than is allowed per mile to railroads using the same.\r\nIf this is intended, as the language seems to import, to authorize this\r\nbridge company to charge the United States Government a toll for the\r\ncarriage of its mails across the bridge equal to the amount which may\r\nbe paid per mile by the Government for carrying the mails by railroads\r\ncrossing the bridge, it seems to me it should not be allowed. The\r\nexpense to the Government for carrying the mails over the structure\r\nshould beyond any doubt be limited to the compensation paid the\r\nrailroads for transportation.\r\n\r\nAn exceedingly important objection to the bill remains to be considered.\r\nIn 1890 the North River Bridge Company was incorporated by an act of\r\nCongress for the purpose of constructing a bridge across the North\r\nRiver, the New York terminus of which was located at or near\r\nTwenty-third street in the city of New York. The proposition to\r\nconstruct the bridge at that point was a subject very carefully and\r\nthoroughly examined at that time and during the agitation of the project\r\nfor a number of years prior to the passage of the act. As a result of\r\nsuch examination and much discussion, Congress granted permission to\r\nthis company to construct a bridge having a single span and suspended\r\nfrom towers on each side of the river, and in the act especially\r\nprohibited the placing of any piers in the river, either of a temporary\r\nor of a permanent character, in connection with said bridge. This plan\r\nto bridge the river without piers was at that time considered feasible\r\nby the engineers of the company, and it accepted the terms of the act.\r\nBefore this permission was finally granted a number of bills were\r\nintroduced in the Congress covering the same subject, which were\r\nreferred to Government engineers. Reports were made by these officers in\r\nevery case insisting upon a construction with a single span and without\r\npiers in the bed of the river.\r\n\r\nThe eighth subdivision of the bill herewith returned provides that any\r\ncompany heretofore created for the purpose of bridging the river may\r\navail itself of the provisions of the act, and makes such company\r\nsubject to all its provisions. This, of course, has reference to\r\nthe North River Bridge Company and releases that company from the\r\nprohibition of the act under which it was permitted to span the river\r\nand permits it to construct piers in the river. It seems to me that\r\nthe language of the bill under consideration, so far as it relates to\r\nthis particular feature, is equivalent to a new grant to that company,\r\ndiffering very materially from the grant which was thought expedient at\r\nthe time it was before the Congress, and removes the guaranty that in\r\nthe construction of its bridge there shall be no obstructions in the\r\nriver such as were especially guarded against by the bill originally\r\npassed for its benefit. In effect a new charter is granted to a company\r\nnot named in the bill, and with no apparent reason for the important\r\nenlargement of its privileges thus accomplished. It is entirely apparent\r\nthat the reasons against obstructions in the North River which might\r\ninterfere with commerce and navigation and the beneficial use of the\r\nharbor of New York are immensely strengthened when they are applied to\r\na location in the river far below the location of the bridge which is\r\npermitted in the bill now before me.\r\n\r\nWhatever question there may be about the injurious character of the\r\nobstruction at Sixty-sixth street in New York City, I believe there can\r\nbe no doubt whatever that piers placed in the river more than 2 miles\r\nbelow, at Twenty-third street, would be very serious impediments. If\r\nthis thoroughfare, so important to the commerce of the country and the\r\nState of New York, is to be crossed by bridges, each scheme for that\r\npurpose should be considered by itself and its merits and advisability\r\ndetermined by the circumstances which naturally belong to it. The\r\nobjection to piers in the river for the purpose of supporting bridges is\r\nin any event so serious that the considerations which would determine\r\nthe question of a bridge located at Sixty-sixth street ought not in\r\nsuch an indirect manner as is done by this bill be applied to a like\r\nstructure at Twenty-third street.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _March 29, 1894_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without my approval House bill No. 4956, entitled \"An act\r\ndirecting the coinage of the silver bullion held in the Treasury, and\r\nfor other purposes.\"\r\n\r\nMy strong desire to avoid disagreement with those in both Houses of\r\nCongress who have supported this bill would lead me to approve it if I\r\ncould believe that the public good would not be thereby endangered and\r\nthat such action on my part would be a proper discharge of official\r\nduty. Inasmuch, however, as I am unable to satisfy myself that the\r\nproposed legislation is either wise or opportune, my conception of the\r\nobligations and responsibilities attached to the great office I hold\r\nforbids the indulgence of my personal desire and inexorably confines me\r\nto that course which is dictated by my reason and judgment and pointed\r\nout by a sincere purpose to protect and promote the general interests of\r\nour people.\r\n\r\nThe financial disturbance which swept over the country during the last\r\nyear was unparalleled in its severity and disastrous consequences. There\r\nseemed to be almost an entire displacement of faith in our financial\r\nability and a loss of confidence in our fiscal policy. Among those who\r\nattempted to assign causes for our distress it was very generally\r\nconceded that the operation of a provision of law then in force which\r\nrequired the Government to purchase monthly a large amount of silver\r\nbullion and issue its notes in payment therefor was either entirely or\r\nto a large extent responsible for our condition. This led to the repeal\r\non the 1st day of November, 1893, of this statutory provision.\r\n\r\nWe had, however, fallen so low in the depths of depression and timidity\r\nand apprehension had so completely gained control in financial circles\r\nthat our rapid recuperation could not be reasonably expected. Our\r\nrecovery has, nevertheless, steadily progressed, and though less than\r\nfive months have elapsed since the repeal of the mischievous\r\nsilver-purchase requirement a wholesome improvement is unmistakably\r\napparent. Confidence in our absolute solvency is to such an extent\r\nreinstated and faith in our disposition to adhere to sound financial\r\nmethods is so far restored as to produce the most encouraging results\r\nboth at home and abroad. The wheels of domestic industry have been\r\nslowly set in motion and the tide of foreign investment has again\r\nstarted in our direction.\r\n\r\nOur recovery being so well under way, nothing should be done to check\r\nour convalescence; nor should we forget that a relapse at this time\r\nwould almost surely reduce us to a lower stage of financial distress\r\nthan that from which we are just emerging.\r\n\r\nI believe that if the bill under consideration should become a law it\r\nwould be regarded as a retrogression from the financial intentions\r\nindicated by our recent repeal of the provision forcing silver-bullion\r\npurchases; that it would weaken, if it did not destroy, returning\r\nfaith and confidence in our sound financial tendencies, and that\r\nas a consequence our progress to renewed business health would be\r\nunfortunately checked and a return to our recent distressing plight\r\nseriously threatened.\r\n\r\nThis proposed legislation is so related to the currency conditions\r\ngrowing out of the law compelling the purchase of silver by the\r\nGovernment that a glance at such conditions and a partial review of the\r\nlaw referred to may not be unprofitable.\r\n\r\nBetween the 14th day of August, 1890, when the law became operative, and\r\nthe 1st day of November, 1893, when the clause it contained directing\r\nthe purchase of silver was repealed, there were purchased by the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury more than 168,000,000 ounces of silver\r\nbullion. In payment for this bullion the Government issued its Treasury\r\nnotes, of various denominations, amounting to nearly $156,000,000, which\r\nnotes were immediately added to the currency in circulation among our\r\npeople. Such notes were by the law made legal tender in payment of all\r\ndebts, public and private, except when otherwise expressly stipulated,\r\nand were made receivable for customs, taxes, and all public dues,\r\nand when so received might be reissued. They were also permitted to be\r\nheld by banking associations as a part of their lawful reserves.\r\n\r\nOn the demand of the holders these Treasury notes were to be redeemed in\r\ngold or silver coin, in the discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury;\r\nbut it was declared as a part of this redemption provision that it was\r\n\"the established policy of the United States to maintain the two metals\r\non a parity with each other upon the present legal ratio or such ratio\r\nas may be provided by law.\" The money coined from such bullion was to be\r\nstandard silver dollars, and after directing the immediate coinage of a\r\nlittle less than 28,000,000 ounces the law provided that as much of the\r\nremaining bullion should be thereafter coined as might be necessary to\r\nprovide for the redemption of the Treasury notes issued on its purchase,\r\nand that \"any gain or seigniorage arising from such coinage shall be\r\naccounted for and paid into the Treasury.\"\r\n\r\nThis gain or seigniorage evidently indicates so much of the bullion\r\nowned by the Government as should remain after using a sufficient amount\r\nto coin as many standard silver dollars as should equal in number the\r\ndollars represented by the Treasury notes issued in payment of the\r\nentire quantity of bullion. These Treasury notes now outstanding and in\r\ncirculation amount to $152,951,280, and although there has been thus\r\nfar but a comparatively small amount of this bullion coined, yet the\r\nso-called gain or seigniorage, as above defined, which would arise\r\nfrom the coinage of the entire mass has been easily ascertained to be a\r\nquantity of bullion sufficient to make when coined 55,156,681 standard\r\nsilver dollars.\r\n\r\nConsidering the present intrinsic relation between gold and silver, the\r\nmaintenance of the parity between the two metals, as mentioned in this\r\nlaw, can mean nothing less than the maintenance of such a parity in the\r\nestimation and confidence of the people who use our money in their daily\r\ntransactions. Manifestly the maintenance of this parity can only be\r\naccomplished, so far as it is affected by these Treasury notes and in\r\nthe estimation of the holders of the same, by giving to such holders\r\non their redemption the coin, whether it is gold or silver, which they\r\nprefer. It follows that while in terms the law leaves the choice of coin\r\nto be paid on such redemption to the discretion of the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, the exercise of this discretion, if opposed to the demands of\r\nthe holder, is entirely inconsistent with the effective and beneficial\r\nmaintenance of the parity between the two metals.\r\n\r\nIf both gold and silver are to serve us as money and if they together\r\nare to supply to our people a safe and stable currency, the necessity of\r\npreserving this parity is obvious. Such necessity has been repeatedly\r\nconceded in the platforms of both political parties and in our Federal\r\nstatutes. It is nowhere more emphatically recognized than in the recent\r\nlaw which repealed the provision under which the bullion now on hand was\r\npurchased. This law insists upon the \"maintenance of the parity in value\r\nof the coins of the two metals and the equal power of every dollar at\r\nall times in the markets and in the payment of debts.\"\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Treasury has therefore, for the best of reasons,\r\nnot only promptly complied with every demand for the redemption of these\r\nTreasury notes in gold, but the present situation as well as the letter\r\nand spirit of the law appear plainly to justify, if they do not enjoin\r\nupon him, a continuation of such redemption.\r\n\r\nThe conditions I have endeavored to present may be thus summarized:\r\n\r\nFirst. The Government has purchased and now has on hand sufficient\r\nsilver bullion to permit the coinage of all the silver dollars necessary\r\nto redeem in such dollars the Treasury notes issued for the purchase of\r\nsaid silver bullion, and enough besides to coin, as gain or seigniorage,\r\n55,156,681 additional standard silver dollars.\r\n\r\nSecond. There are outstanding and now in circulation Treasury notes\r\nissued in payment of the bullion purchased amounting to $152,951,280.\r\nThese notes are legal tender in payment of all debts, public and\r\nprivate, except when otherwise expressly stipulated; they are receivable\r\nfor customs, taxes, and all public dues; when held by banking\r\nassociations they may be counted as part of their lawful reserves,\r\nand they are redeemed by the Government in gold at the option of the\r\nholders. These advantageous attributes were deliberately attached to\r\nthese notes at the time of their issue. They are fully understood by our\r\npeople to whom such notes have been distributed as currency, and have\r\ninspired confidence in their safety and value, and have undoubtedly thus\r\ninduced their continued and contented use as money, instead of anxiety\r\nfor their redemption.\r\n\r\nHaving referred to some incidents which I deem relevant to the subject,\r\nit remains for me to submit a specific statement of my objections to the\r\nbill now under consideration.\r\n\r\nThis bill consists of two sections, excluding one which merely\r\nappropriates a sum sufficient to carry the act into effect. The first\r\nsection provides for the immediate coinage of the silver bullion in the\r\nTreasury which represents the so-called gain or seigniorage, or which\r\nwould arise from the coinage of all the bullion on hand, which gain or\r\nseigniorage this section declares to be $55,156,681. It directs that the\r\nmoney so coined or the certificates issued thereon shall be used in the\r\npayment of public expenditures, and provides that if the needs of the\r\nTreasury demand it the Secretary of the Treasury may, in his discretion,\r\nissue silver certificates in excess of such coinage, not exceeding the\r\namount of seigniorage in said section authorized to be coined.\r\n\r\nThe second section directs that as soon as possible after the coinage of\r\nthis seigniorage the remainder of the bullion held by the Government\r\nshall be coined into legal-tender standard silver dollars, and that they\r\nshall be held in the Treasury for the redemption of the Treasury notes\r\nissued in the purchase of said bullion. It provides that as fast as the\r\nbullion shall be coined for the redemption of said notes they shall not\r\nbe reissued, but shall be canceled and destroyed in amounts equal to the\r\ncoin held at any time in the Treasury derived from the coinage provided\r\nfor, and that silver certificates shall be issued on such coin in the\r\nmanner now provided by law. It is, however, especially declared in said\r\nsection that the act shall not be construed to change existing laws\r\nrelating to the legal-tender character or mode of redemption of the\r\nTreasury notes issued for the purchase of the silver bullion to be\r\ncoined.\r\n\r\nThe entire bill is most unfortunately constructed. Nearly every sentence\r\npresents uncertainty and invites controversy as to its meaning and\r\nintent. The first section is especially faulty in this respect, and it\r\nis extremely doubtful whether its language will permit the consummation\r\nof its supposed purposes. I am led to believe that the promoters of the\r\nbill intended in this section to provide for the coinage of the bullion\r\nconstituting the gain or seigniorage, as it is called, into standard\r\nsilver dollars, and yet there is positively nothing in the section to\r\nprevent its coinage into any description of silver coins now authorized\r\nunder any existing law.\r\n\r\nI suppose this section was also intended, in case the needs of the\r\nTreasury called for money faster than the seigniorage bullion could\r\nactually be coined, to permit the issue of silver certificates in\r\nadvance of such coinage; but its language would seem to permit the\r\nissuance of such certificates to double the amount of seigniorage as\r\nstated, one-half of which would not represent an ounce of silver in\r\nthe Treasury. The debate upon this section in the Congress developed\r\nan earnest and positive difference of opinion as to its object and\r\nmeaning. In any event, I am clear that the present perplexities and\r\nembarrassments of the Secretary of the Treasury ought not to be\r\naugmented by devolving upon him the execution of a law so uncertain\r\nand confused.\r\n\r\nI am not willing, however, to rest my objection to this section solely\r\non these grounds. In my judgment sound finance does not commend a\r\nfurther infusion of silver into our currency at this time unaccompanied\r\nby further adequate provision for the maintenance in our Treasury of a\r\nsafe gold reserve.\r\n\r\nDoubts also arise as to the meaning and construction of the second\r\nsection of the bill. If the silver dollars therein directed to be coined\r\nare, as the section provides, to be held in the Treasury for the\r\nredemption of Treasury notes, it is suggested that, strictly speaking,\r\ncertificates can not be issued on such coin \"in the manner now provided\r\nby law,\" because these dollars are money held in the Treasury for the\r\nexpress purpose of redeeming Treasury notes on demand, which would\r\nordinarily mean that they were set apart for the purpose of substituting\r\nthem for these Treasury notes. They are not, therefore, held in such a\r\nway as to furnish a basis for certificates according to any provision of\r\nexisting law.\r\n\r\nIf however, silver certificates can properly be issued upon these\r\ndollars, there is nothing in the section to indicate the characteristics\r\nand functions of these certificates. If they were to be of the same\r\ncharacter as silver certificates in circulation under existing laws,\r\nthey would at best be receivable only for customs, taxes, and all public\r\ndues; and under the language of this section it is, to say the least,\r\nextremely doubtful whether the certificates it contemplates would be\r\nlawfully received even for such purposes.\r\n\r\nWhatever else may be said of the uncertainties of expression in this\r\nbill, they certainly ought not to be found in legislation affecting\r\nsubjects so important and far-reaching as our finances and currency.\r\nIn stating other and more important reasons for my disapproval of this\r\nsection I shall, however, assume that under its provisions the Treasury\r\nnotes issued in payment for silver bullion will continue to be redeemed\r\nas heretofore, in silver or gold, at the option of the holders, and that\r\nif when they are presented for redemption or reach the Treasury in any\r\nother manner there are in the Treasury coined silver dollars equal in\r\nnominal value to such Treasury notes, then and in that case the notes\r\nwill be destroyed and silver certificates to an equal amount be\r\nsubstituted.\r\n\r\nI am convinced that this scheme is ill advised and dangerous. As an\r\nultimate result of its operation Treasury notes, which are legal tender\r\nfor all debts, public and private, and which are redeemable in gold\r\nor silver at the option of the holder, will be replaced by silver\r\ncertificates, which, whatever may be their character and description,\r\nwill have none of these qualities. In anticipation of this result and\r\nas an immediate effect the Treasury notes will naturally appreciate in\r\nvalue and desirability. The fact that gold can be realized upon them and\r\nthe further fact that their destruction has been decreed when they reach\r\nthe Treasury must tend to their withdrawal from general circulation\r\nto be immediately presented for gold redemption or to be hoarded for\r\npresentation at a more convenient season. The sequel of both operations\r\nwill be a large addition to the silver currency in our circulation and a\r\ncorresponding reduction of gold in the Treasury. The argument has been\r\nmade that these things will not occur at once, because a long time must\r\nelapse before the coinage of anything but the seigniorage can be entered\r\nupon. If the physical effects of the execution of the second section\r\nof this bill are not to be realized until far in the future, this may\r\nfurnish a strong reason why it should not be passed so much in advance;\r\nbut the postponement of its actual operation can not prevent the fear\r\nand loss of confidence and nervous precaution which would immediately\r\nfollow its passage and bring about its worst consequences. I regard this\r\nsection of the bill as embodying a plan by which the Government will be\r\nobliged to pay out its scanty store of gold for no other purpose than\r\nto force an unnatural addition of silver money into the hands of our\r\npeople. This is an exact reversal of the policy which safe finance\r\ndictates if we are to preserve parity between gold and silver and\r\nmaintain sensible bimetallism.\r\n\r\nWe have now outstanding more than $338,000,000 in silver certificates\r\nissued under existing laws. They are serving the purpose of money\r\nusefully and without question. Our gold reserve, amounting to only a\r\nlittle more than $100,000,000, is directly charged with the redemption\r\nof $346,000,000 of United States notes. When it is proposed to inflate\r\nour silver currency it is a time for strengthening our gold reserve\r\ninstead of depleting it. I can not conceive of a longer step toward\r\nsilver monometallism than we take when we spend our gold to buy silver\r\ncertificates for circulation, especially in view of the practical\r\ndifficulties surrounding the replenishment of our gold.\r\n\r\nThis leads me to earnestly present the desirability of granting to the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury a better power than now exists to issue bonds\r\nto protect our gold reserve when for any reason it should be necessary.\r\nOur currency is in such a confused condition and our financial affairs\r\nare apt to assume at any time so critical a position that it seems to me\r\nsuch a course is dictated by ordinary prudence.\r\n\r\nI am not insensible to the arguments in favor of coining the bullion\r\nseigniorage now in the Treasury, and I believe it could be done safely\r\nand with advantage if the Secretary of the Treasury had the power to\r\nissue bonds at a low rate of interest under authority in substitution of\r\nthat now existing and better suited to the protection of the Treasury.\r\n\r\nI hope a way will present itself in the near future for the adjustment\r\nof our monetary affairs in such a comprehensive and conservative manner\r\nas will accord to silver its proper place in our currency; but in the\r\nmeantime I am extremely solicitous that whatever action we take on this\r\nsubject may be such as to prevent loss and discouragement to our people\r\nat home and the destruction of confidence in our financial management\r\nabroad.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _August 7, 1894_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return without approval House bill No. 2637, entitled \"An act\r\nfor the relief of Eugene Wells, late captain, Twelfth Infantry, and\r\nsecond lieutenant, First Artillery, United States Army.\"\r\n\r\nThis bill authorizes the President to nominate and, by and with the\r\nadvice and consent of the Senate, to appoint the beneficiary therein\r\nnamed a second lieutenant of artillery in the Army of the United States,\r\nand it directs that when so appointed he shall be placed upon the\r\nretired list on account of disability, thus dispensing with the usual\r\nexamination and finding by a retiring board and all other ordinary\r\nprerequisites of retirement.\r\n\r\nAppointments to the Army under the authority of special legislation\r\nwhich names the proposed appointee, and the purpose of which is the\r\nimmediate retirement of the appointee, are open to serious objections,\r\nthough I confess I have been persuaded through sympathy and sentiment on\r\na number of occasions to approve such legislation. When, however, it is\r\nproposed to make the retirement compulsory and without reference to age\r\nor previous examination, a most objectionable feature is introduced.\r\n\r\nThe cases covered by the special enactments referred to are usually such\r\nas should, if worthy of any consideration, be provided for under general\r\nor private pension laws, leaving the retired list of the Army to serve\r\nthe legitimate purpose for which it was established.\r\n\r\nA recent discussion in the House of Representatives upon a bill similar\r\nto the one now before me drew from a member of the House Committee on\r\nMilitary Affairs the declaration that hundreds of such bills were before\r\nthat committee and that there were fifty precedents for the passage of\r\nthe particular one then under discussion.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that this condition suggests such an encroachment upon\r\nthe retired list of the Army as should lead to the virtual abandonment\r\nof the legislation referred to.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the objections to such legislation based upon sound\r\npolicy and good administration, there are facts connected with the case\r\ncovered by the bill now before me which, in my judgment, forbid its\r\nfavorable consideration.\r\n\r\nThe beneficiary named in this bill entered the military service as first\r\nlieutenant in 1861. In September or October, 1870, then being a captain,\r\na charge of conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman was preferred\r\nagainst him with a view to his trial on said charge before a\r\ncourt-martial.\r\n\r\nThe Articles of War provide that any officer convicted of this offense\r\nshall be dismissed the service.\r\n\r\nThe first specification under this charge alleged that Captain Wells did\r\nviolently and without just cause or provocation assault First Lieutenant\r\nP.H. Breslin \"by furiously striking and hitting him (Lieutenant Breslin)\r\nupon the head with a hickory stick, the butt end of a billiard cue, and\r\ndid continue the assault (upon Lieutenant Breslin) until forced to\r\ndesist therefrom by First Lieutenant Carl Veitenhimer, Fourth United\r\nStates Infantry, thereby endangering the life of Lieutenant Breslin and\r\ndisgracing himself (Captain Wells) as an officer of the United States\r\nArmy.\"\r\n\r\nThe second specification alleged that Captain Wells \"did become so much\r\nunder the influence of intoxicating liquor as to behave himself in a\r\nscandalous manner by violently attacking the person of First Lieutenant\r\nP.H. Breslin, Fourth United States Infantry.\"\r\n\r\nThese offenses were charged to have been committed on the 3d day of\r\nSeptember, 1870, at Fort Fetterman, in Wyoming Territory.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th day of July, 1870, a law was passed, among other things,\r\nto bring about a reduction of the Army, which law provided that the\r\nPresident should before the 1st day of July, 1871, reduce the number of\r\nenlisted men in the Army to 30,000, and authorized him in his discretion\r\nto honorably discharge from the service of the United States officers of\r\nthe Army who might apply therefor on or before January 1, 1871.\r\n\r\nBefore the trial by court-martial upon the charge then pending against\r\nhim Captain Wells applied for his discharge under the provision of the\r\nlaw above recited, whereupon the charge against him was withdrawn and\r\ncanceled, and on the 27th day of October, 1870, his application for a\r\ndischarge was granted.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th day of July, 1875, he was again appointed to the Army as\r\nsecond lieutenant in the artillery, against which a remonstrance was\r\nmade by certain officers in the Army.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1877, Second Lieutenant Wells was charged with being \"drunk\r\non duty, in violation of the thirty-eighth article of war.\"\r\n\r\nHe was also charged with \"conduct to the prejudice of good order and\r\nmilitary discipline.\"\r\n\r\nThe first specification under the latter charge alleged that the accused\r\ndid \"engage in an affray with First Lieutenant E. Van A. Andruss, First\r\nArtillery.\" The second specification under said charge alleged that the\r\naccused addressed his superior officer in a defiant and disrespectful\r\nmanner and neglected and hesitated to promptly obey the order of said\r\nsuperior officer.\r\n\r\nAll these offenses were alleged to have been committed at Reading, Pa.,\r\non the 2d day of August, 1877.\r\n\r\nSoon after these charges were preferred a court-martial was convened for\r\nthe trial of the accused thereon. He pleaded not guilty to the charges\r\nand specifications, but was convicted of them all and sentenced \"to be\r\ndismissed the service of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 6th day of October the proceedings, findings, and sentence of the\r\ncourt-martial were approved by the President, who ordered the sentence\r\nto be executed; and on the 13th day of October, 1877, in pursuance\r\nthereof, Lieutenant Eugene Wells was dismissed from the service.\r\n\r\nSince that time repeated efforts have been made to vacate this judgment\r\nand restore the dismissed officer to the service. While a number of\r\ncommittees in Congress have made reports favorable to such action, at\r\nleast two committees have recommended a denial of legislative relief.\r\nBoth of these reports were made on behalf of House Committees on\r\nMilitary Affairs by distinguished soldiers, who, after patient\r\nexamination and with an inclination to be not only just but generous to\r\na fellow-soldier, were constrained to recommend a refusal of the\r\napplication for restoration. One of these reports was made to the\r\nForty-seventh and the other to the Forty-ninth Congress.\r\n\r\nI am impressed with the belief that legislation of the kind proposed is\r\nof extremely doubtful expediency in any save very exceptional cases, and\r\nI am thoroughly convinced by the facts now before me that the discipline\r\nand efficiency of our Army, as well as justice to its meritorious\r\nmembers, do not permit my approval on any ground of the bill herewith\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _August 11, 1894_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI hereby return without my approval Senate bill No. 1438, entitled\r\n\"An act for the relief of Louis A. Yorke.\"\r\n\r\nIn the year 1886 the beneficiary named in this bill was a passed\r\nassistant paymaster in the Navy. In December of that year he appeared\r\nbefore a naval examining board convened pursuant to law for the purpose\r\nof passing upon his fitness to be promoted to the grade of paymaster.\r\n\r\nThe investigation of the board was conducted fairly and thoroughly. Much\r\nof the evidence relating to the candidate's moral fitness for promotion\r\nwas documentary, and the examination touching his professional\r\ncompetency was of the usual character in such cases.\r\n\r\nConsiderable evidence was before the board showing quite a large amount\r\nof personal indebtedness owing by the candidate, and it appeared that\r\nin a few instances his accounts with the Navy Department had not been\r\npromptly settled. It was also shown that he had not at all times\r\ndeposited the Government money intrusted to his care in the places\r\nrequired by law and the regulations of the Navy. In connection with his\r\npersonal indebtedness incidents and circumstances were brought to light\r\nwhich certainly indicated that he entertained very lax ideas of honest\r\ndealing and fairness and which developed a disregard of the obligations\r\nand requirements of his position as an officer in the Navy. He was given\r\nabundant opportunity to meet and explain every damaging allegation and\r\nevery adverse inference arising from the evidence, and his claim, not\r\nwithout foundation it appeared, that the charges against him were\r\ninstigated by malice was doubtless given full weight.\r\n\r\nThe examining board on the evidence made the following decisions and\r\nfindings:\r\n\r\n  The written examination of the candidate shows that he is deficient in\r\n  his knowledge of the duties appertaining to the next higher grade; and\r\n  the record evidence puts in question his moral fitness, and he has\r\n  failed to establish both his professional and moral qualifications for\r\n  promotion to the satisfaction of the board.\r\n\r\n  Therefore we hereby certify that Passed Assistant Paymaster Louis A.\r\n  Yorke, United States Navy, has the mental fitness to perform efficiently\r\n  all the duties, both at sea and on shore, of the next higher grade, but\r\n  he has not the professional and moral qualifications required, and we do\r\n  not recommend him for promotion.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the board had thus disposed of the case and had adjourned it was,\r\nat the request of the candidate, reconvened by order of the Secretary of\r\nthe Navy, who issued for its guidance the following directions, among\r\nothers:\r\n\r\n  The board will inform Passed Assistant Paymaster Yorke of its findings\r\n  and of the evidence upon which it finds him to be not morally qualified\r\n  for promotion, and will afford him a further hearing and an opportunity\r\n  to present such evidence as he may desire as to his moral fitness for\r\n  promotion.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe board met pursuant to such order on the 4th day of January, 1887,\r\nwhen the findings of the board were read to the candidate for promotion,\r\nand also the evidence upon which said findings were based, and he was\r\ninformed that the board would accord him a further hearing as to his\r\nmoral fitness for promotion and would afford him a reasonable time in\r\nwhich to submit his case. Thereupon he requested the board to allow him\r\nuntil the 26th day of January to produce the necessary witnesses in his\r\nbehalf. This request was granted, but on the day appointed, upon his\r\nrepresentation that he was then unable to submit his defense, he was\r\nupon his request allowed another day for that purpose.\r\n\r\nIn availing himself of the opportunity thus afforded him to present\r\nevidence in defense or explanation of the matters charged against him\r\nhe examined no witnesses and contented himself with presenting his own\r\nstatement, containing little more than a reiteration of statements he\r\nhad already made before the board at previous hearings, supplemented by\r\nslight documentary evidence which established no new facts in his favor.\r\n\r\nThe board thereupon reviewed all the evidence and proofs which had been\r\nsubmitted during the entire examination, and after full consideration\r\ndecided that there was nothing in the additional evidence produced to\r\nwarrant a modification of the original finding, and the board therefore\r\nagain certified and decided that the candidate had not the moral\r\nqualifications to perform efficiently the duties of the grade to which\r\nhe sought promotion.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Navy transmitted the record, proceedings, and\r\nfindings of said examining board to the President, with a recommendation\r\nthat the same be approved and that the candidate be discharged from the\r\nNavy with one year's pay, pursuant to a statute passed on the 5th day of\r\nAugust, 1882, directing a discharge from the service in such cases.\r\n\r\nThereupon, and on the 19th day of February, 1887, the record,\r\nproceedings, and findings of said board were approved by the President,\r\nand Passed Assistant Paymaster Yorke was ordered discharged from the\r\nnaval service with one year's pay.\r\n\r\nThe bill now under consideration provides that the action of the\r\nexamining board above recited \"be set aside and declared null and void.\"\r\nIt also authorizes the President \"to appoint the beneficiary to the\r\noffice to which he would have been promoted but for said action and to\r\nretire him in that grade as of the date he was wholly retired.\"\r\n\r\nThe authority attempted by the bill to be given to the President to thus\r\nmake an appointment to the office of paymaster in the Navy without the\r\ninterposition of the Senate appears to be inadmissible under that clause\r\nof the Constitution which only permits the President to appoint certain\r\nofficers \"by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.\"\r\n\r\nThe bill provides for the immediate retirement of the beneficiary.\r\nHe is now but 47 years old, thus lacking fifteen years of the time\r\nwhen he would be entitled to retirement on account of age. There is no\r\nsuggestion that he is physically incapacitated. On the contrary, when\r\nhe was examined for promotion a medical board certified that he was\r\nphysically qualified to perform all his duties at sea, and the candidate\r\nhimself not only certified to the same thing, but further declared that\r\nhe was \"free from all bodily ailments.\" If this condition continues and\r\nif he should be restored to the Navy at all, he should be sent to duty\r\non the active list instead of being retired. On the facts as presented\r\nhe would seem to be out of place among those who, though still\r\ncompensated by the Government, have been on account of age, long and\r\nhonorable service, or disabilities incurred in the discharge of duty\r\nrelieved from further activity.\r\n\r\nA careful investigation of the facts submitted to the examining board\r\nand a consideration of all the statements made on behalf of the\r\nbeneficiary named in the bill utterly fail, in my opinion, to justify\r\nthe impeachment of the findings and determination of the board.\r\n\r\nI have no doubt malicious feeling growing out of domestic difficulties\r\nentered into the affair and gave impetus to the search after inculpating\r\nevidence, but facts were nevertheless established beyond any reasonable\r\ndoubt which abundantly uphold these findings.\r\n\r\nI feel obliged to disapprove the bill herewith returned because I\r\nbelieve the power to appoint a paymaster in the Navy ought not, under\r\nthe Constitution, be conferred upon the President alone; because if the\r\nbeneficiary were restored to the Navy there would be no justice or\r\npropriety in placing him upon the retired list, and because upon the\r\nmerits of the case I am of the opinion the judgment of the examining\r\nboard ought not to be reversed.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas an act of Congress entitled \"An act to give effect to the award\r\nrendered by the Tribunal of Arbitration at Paris under the treaty\r\nbetween the United States and Great Britain concluded at Washington\r\nFebruary 29, 1892, for the purpose of submitting to arbitration certain\r\nquestions concerning the preservation of the fur seals,\" was approved\r\nApril 6, 1894, and reads as follows:\r\n\r\n  Whereas the following articles of the award of the Tribunal of\r\n  Arbitration constituted under the treaty concluded at Washington the\r\n  29th of February, 1892, between the United States of America and Her\r\n  Majesty the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland\r\n  were delivered to the agents of the respective Governments on the\r\n  15th day of August, 1893:\r\n\r\n  \"ARTICLE 1.

The rules concerning lights shall be complied with in all\r\n  weathers from sunset to sunrise, and during such time no other lights\r\n  which may be mistaken for the prescribed lights shall be exhibited.\r\n\r\n  ART. 2. A steam vessel when under way shall carry--\r\n\r\n  (_a_) On or in front of the foremast, or if a vessel without a\r\n  foremast, then in the fore part of the vessel, at a height above the\r\n  hull of not less than 20 feet, and if the breadth of the vessel exceeds\r\n  20 feet, then at a height above the hull not less than such breadth, so,\r\n  however, that the light need not be carried at a greater height above\r\n  the hull than 40 feet a bright white light so constructed as to show\r\n  an unbroken light over an arc of the horizon of 20 points of the\r\n  compass, so fixed as to throw the light 10 points on each side of the\r\n  vessel--namely, from right ahead to 2 points abaft the beam on either\r\n  side--and of such a character as to be visible at a distance of at least\r\n  5 miles.\r\n\r\n  (_b_) On the starboard side a green light so constructed as to show\r\n  an unbroken light over an arc of the horizon of 10 points of the\r\n  compass, so fixed as to throw the light from right ahead to 2 points\r\n  abaft the beam on the starboard side, and of such a character as to be\r\n  visible at a distance of at least 2 miles.\r\n\r\n  (_c_) On the port side a red light so constructed as to show an\r\n  unbroken light over an arc of the horizon of 10 points of the compass,\r\n  so fixed as to throw the light from right ahead to 2 points abaft the\r\n  beam on the port side, and of such a character as to be visible at a\r\n  distance of at least 2 miles.\r\n\r\n  (_d_) The said green and red side lights shall be fitted with\r\n  inboard screens projecting at least 3 feet forward from the light, so as\r\n  to prevent these lights from being seen across the bow.\r\n\r\n  (_e_) A steam vessel when under way may carry an additional white\r\n  light similar in construction to the light mentioned in subdivision\r\n  (_a_). These two lights shall be so placed in line with the keel\r\n  that one shall be at least 15 feet higher than the other and in such a\r\n  position with reference to each other that the lower light shall be\r\n  forward of the upper one. The vertical distance between these lights\r\n  shall be less than the horizontal distance.\r\n\r\n  ART. 3. A steam vessel when towing another vessel shall, in addition to\r\n  her side lights, carry two bright white lights in a vertical line one\r\n  over the other, not less than 6 feet apart, and when towing more than\r\n  one vessel shall carry an additional bright white light 6 feet above or\r\n  below such light if the length of the tow measuring from the stern of\r\n  the towing vessel to the stern of the last vessel towed exceeds 600\r\n  feet. Bach of these lights shall be of the same construction and\r\n  character and shall be carried in the same position as the white light\r\n  mentioned in article 2 (_a_), excepting the additional light, which\r\n  may be carried at a height of not less than 14 feet above the hull.\r\n\r\n  Such steam vessel may carry a small white light abaft the funnel or\r\n  aftermast for the vessel towed to steer by, but such light shall not be\r\n  visible forward of the beam.\r\n\r\n  ART. 4. (_a_) A vessel which from any accident is not under command\r\n  shall carry at the same height as a white light mentioned in article 2\r\n  (_a_), where they can best be seen, and if a steam vessel in lieu\r\n  of that light, two red lights in a vertical line one over the other, not\r\n  less than 6 feet apart, and of such a character as to be visible all\r\n  around the horizon at a distance of at least 2 miles; and shall by day\r\n  carry in a vertical line one over the other, not less than 6 feet apart,\r\n  where they can best be seen, two black balls or shapes each 2 feet in\r\n  diameter.\r\n\r\n  (_b_) A vessel employed in laying or in picking up a telegraph\r\n  cable shall carry in the same position as the white light mentioned in\r\n  article 2 (_a_), and if a steam vessel in lieu of that light, three\r\n  lights in a vertical line one over the other, not less than 6 feet\r\n  apart. The highest and lowest of these lights shall be red and the\r\n  middle light shall be white, and they shall be of such a character as to\r\n  be visible all around the horizon at a distance of at least 2 miles. By\r\n  day she shall carry in a vertical line one over the other, not less than\r\n  6 feet apart, where they can best be seen, three shapes not less than 2\r\n  feet in diameter, of which the highest and lowest shall be globular in\r\n  shape and red in color and the middle one diamond in shape and white.\r\n\r\n  (_c_) The vessels referred to in this article, when not making way\r\n  through the water, shall not carry the side lights, but when making way\r\n  shall carry them.\r\n\r\n  (_d_) The lights and shapes required to be shown by this article\r\n  are to be taken by other vessels as signals that the vessel showing them\r\n  is not under command and can not, therefore, get out of the way.\r\n\r\n  These signals are not signals of vessels in distress and requiring\r\n  assistance. Such signals are contained in article 31.\r\n\r\n  ART. 5. A sailing vessel under way and any vessel being towed shall\r\n  carry the same lights as are prescribed by article 2 for a steam vessel\r\n  under way, with the exception of the white lights mentioned therein,\r\n  which they shall never carry.\r\n\r\n  ART. 6. Whenever, as in the case of small vessels under way during bad\r\n  weather, the green and red side lights can not be fixed, these lights\r\n  shall be kept at hand, lighted and ready for use, and shall on the\r\n  approach of or to other vessels be exhibited on their respective sides,\r\n  in sufficient time to prevent collision, in such manner as to make them\r\n  most visible and so that the green light shall not be seen on the port\r\n  side nor the red light on the starboard side, nor, if practicable, more\r\n  than 2 points abaft the beam on their respective sides.\r\n\r\n  To make the use of these portable lights more certain and easy the\r\n  lanterns containing them shall each be painted outside with the color of\r\n  the light they respectively contain and shall be provided with proper\r\n  screens.\r\n\r\n  ART. 7. Steam vessels of less than 40 and vessels under oars or sails of\r\n  less than 20 tons gross tonnage, respectively, when under way shall not\r\n  be obliged to carry the lights mentioned in article 2 (_a_),\r\n  (_b_), and (_c_), but if they do not carry them they shall be\r\n  provided with the following lights:\r\n\r\n  First. Steam vessels of less than 40 tons shall carry--\r\n\r\n  (_a_) In the fore part of the vessel or on or in front of the\r\n  funnel, where it can best be seen, and at a height above the gunwale of\r\n  not less than 9 feet, a bright white light constructed and fixed as\r\n  prescribed in article 2 (_a_) and of such a character as to be\r\n  visible at a distance of at least 2 miles.\r\n\r\n  (_b_) Green and red side lights constructed and fixed as prescribed\r\n  in article 2 (_b_) and (_c_) and of such a character as to be\r\n  visible at a distance of at least 1 mile, or a combined lantern showing\r\n  a green light and a red light from right ahead to 2 points abaft the\r\n  beam on their respective sides. Such lanterns shall be carried not less\r\n  than 3 feet below the white light.\r\n\r\n  Second. Small steamboats, such as are carried by seagoing vessels, may\r\n  carry the white light at a less height than 9 feet above the gunwale,\r\n  but it shall be carried above the combined lantern mentioned in\r\n  subdivision 1 (_b_).\r\n\r\n  Third. Vessels under oars or sails of less than 20 tons shall have ready\r\n  at hand a lantern with a green glass on one side and a red glass on the\r\n  other, which on the approach of or to other vessels shall be exhibited,\r\n  in sufficient time to prevent collision, so that the green light shall\r\n  not be seen on the port side nor the red light on the starboard side.\r\n\r\n  The vessels referred to in this article shall not be obliged to carry\r\n  the lights prescribed by article 4 (_a_) and article 11, last\r\n  paragraph.\r\n\r\n  ART. 8. Pilot vessels when engaged on their station on pilotage duty\r\n  shall not show the lights required for other vessels, but shall carry a\r\n  white light at the masthead, visible all around the horizon, and shall\r\n  also exhibit a flare-up light or flare-up lights at short intervals,\r\n  which shall never exceed fifteen minutes.\r\n\r\n  On the near approach of or to other vessels they shall have their side\r\n  lights lighted, ready for use, and shall flash or show them at short\r\n  intervals to indicate the direction in which they are heading; but the\r\n  green light shall not be shown on the port side nor the red light on the\r\n  starboard side.\r\n\r\n  A pilot vessel of such a class as to be obliged to go alongside of a\r\n  vessel to put a pilot on board may show the white light instead of\r\n  carrying it at the masthead, and may, instead of the colored lights\r\n  above mentioned, have at hand, ready for use, a lantern with a green\r\n  glass on the one side and a red glass on the other, to be used as\r\n  prescribed above.\r\n\r\n  Pilot vessels when not engaged on their station on pilotage duty shall\r\n  carry lights similar to those of other vessels of their tonnage.\r\n\r\n  ART. 9. Fishing vessels and fishing boats when under way and when not\r\n  required by this article to carry or show the lights therein named shall\r\n  carry or show the lights prescribed for vessels of their tonnage under\r\n  way.\r\n\r\n  (_a_) Vessels and boats when fishing with drift nets shall exhibit\r\n  two white lights from any part of the vessel where they can best be\r\n  seen. Such lights shall be placed so that the vertical distance between\r\n  them shall be not less than 6 feet and not more than 10 feet, and so\r\n  that the horizontal distance between them measured in a line with the\r\n  keel shall be not less than 5 feet and not more than 10 feet. The lower\r\n  of these two lights shall be the more forward, and both of them shall be\r\n  of such a character as to show all around the horizon and to be visible\r\n  at a distance of not less than 3 miles.\r\n\r\n  (_b_) Vessels when engaged in trawling, by which is meant the\r\n  dragging of an apparatus along the bottom of the sea--\r\n\r\n  First. If steam vessels, shall carry in the same position as the white\r\n  light mentioned in article 2 (_a_) a tricolored lantern so\r\n  constructed and fixed as to show a white light from right ahead to 2\r\n  points on each bow and a green light and a red light over an arc of the\r\n  horizon from 2 points on either bow to 2 points abaft the beam on the\r\n  starboard and port sides, respectively, and not less than 6 nor more\r\n  than 12 feet below the tricolored lantern, a white light in a lantern so\r\n  constructed as to show a clear, uniform, and unbroken light all around\r\n  the horizon.\r\n\r\n  Second. If sailing vessels of 7 tons gross tonnage and upward, shall\r\n  carry a white light in a lantern so constructed as to show a clear,\r\n  uniform, and unbroken light all around the horizon, and shall also be\r\n  provided with a sufficient supply of red pyrotechnic lights, which shall\r\n  each burn for at least 30 seconds, and shall be shown on the approach of\r\n  or to other vessels in sufficient time to prevent collision.\r\n\r\n  In the Mediterranean Sea the vessels referred to in subdivision\r\n  (_b_) 2 may use a flare-up light in lieu of a pyrotechnic light.\r\n\r\n  All lights mentioned in subdivision (_b_) 1 and 2 shall be visible\r\n  at a distance of at least 2 miles.\r\n\r\n  Third. If sailing vessels of less than 7 tons gross tonnage, shall not\r\n  be obliged to carry the white light mentioned in subdivision (_b_)\r\n  2 of this article, but if they do not carry such light they shall have\r\n  at hand, ready for use, a lantern showing a bright white light, which\r\n  shall on the approach of or to other vessels be exhibited where it can\r\n  best be seen, in sufficient time to prevent collision; and they shall\r\n  also show a red pyrotechnic light, as prescribed in subdivision\r\n  (_b_) 2, or in lieu thereof a flare-up light.\r\n\r\n  (_c_) Vessels and boats when line fishing with their lines out and\r\n  attached to their lines, and when not at anchor or stationary, shall\r\n  carry the same lights as vessels fishing with drift nets.\r\n\r\n  (_d_) Fishing vessels and fishing boats may at any time use a\r\n  flare-up light in addition to the lights which they are by this article\r\n  required to carry and show. All flare-up lights exhibited by a vessel\r\n  when trawling or fishing with any kind of dragnet shall be shown at the\r\n  after part of the vessel, excepting that if the vessel is hanging by the\r\n  stern to her fishing gear they shall be exhibited from the bow.\r\n\r\n  (_e_) Every fishing vessel and every boat when at anchor shall\r\n  exhibit a white light visible all around the horizon at a distance of at\r\n  least 1 mile.\r\n\r\n  (_f_) If a vessel or boat when fishing becomes stationary in\r\n  consequence of her gear getting fast to a rock or other obstruction, she\r\n  shall show the light and make the fog signal prescribed for a vessel at\r\n  anchor, respectively. (See article 15 (_d_), (_e_), and last\r\n  paragraph.)\r\n\r\n  (_g_) In fog, mist, falling snow, or heavy rain storms drift-net\r\n  vessels attached to their nets, and vessels when trawling, dredging, or\r\n  fishing with any kind of dragnet, and vessels line fishing with their\r\n  lines out shall, if of 20 tons gross tonnage or upward, respectively, at\r\n  intervals of not more than one minute make a blast--if steam vessels,\r\n  with the whistle or siren, and if sailing vessels, with the fog\r\n  horn--each blast to be followed by ringing the bell.\r\n\r\n  (_h_) Sailing vessels or boats fishing with nets or lines or trawls\r\n  when under way shall in daytime indicate their occupation to an\r\n  approaching vessel by displaying a basket or other efficient signal\r\n  where it can best be seen.\r\n\r\n  The vessels referred to in this article shall not be obliged to carry\r\n  the lights prescribed by article 4 (_a_) and article 11, last\r\n  paragraph.\r\n\r\n  ART. 10. A vessel which is being overtaken by another shall show from\r\n  her stern to such last-mentioned vessel a white light or a flare-up\r\n  light.\r\n\r\n  The white light required to be shown by this article may be fixed\r\n  and carried in a lantern, but in such case the lantern shall be so\r\n  constructed, fitted, and screened that it shall throw an unbroken light\r\n  over an arc of the horizon of 12 points of the compass--namely, for 6\r\n  points from right aft on each side of the vessel--so as to be visible at\r\n  a distance of at least 1 mile. Such light shall be carried as nearly as\r\n  practicable on the same level as the side lights.\r\n\r\n  ART. 11. A vessel under 150 feet in length when at anchor shall carry\r\n  forward, where it can best be seen, but at a height not exceeding 20\r\n  feet above the hull, a white light in a lantern so constructed as to\r\n  show a clear, uniform, and unbroken light visible all around the horizon\r\n  at a distance of at least 1 mile.\r\n\r\n  A vessel of 150 feet or upward in length when at anchor shall carry in\r\n  the forward part of the vessel, at a height of not less than 20 and not\r\n  exceeding 40 feet above the hull, one such light, and at or near the\r\n  stern of the vessel, and at such a height that it shall be not less than\r\n  15 feet lower than the forward light, another such light.\r\n\r\n  The length of a vessel shall be deemed to be the length appearing in her\r\n  certificate of registry.\r\n\r\n  A vessel aground in or near a fairway shall carry the above light or\r\n  lights and the two red lights prescribed by article 4 (_a_).\r\n\r\n  ART. 12. Every vessel may, if necessary in order to attract attention,\r\n  in addition to the lights which she is by these rules required to carry,\r\n  show a flare-up light or use any detonating signal that can not be\r\n  mistaken for a distress signal.\r\n\r\n  ART. 13. Nothing in these rules shall interfere with the operation of\r\n  any special rules made by the government of any nation with respect to\r\n  additional station and signal lights for two or more ships of war or for\r\n  vessels sailing under convoy, or with the exhibition of recognition\r\n  signals adopted by shipowners which have been authorized by their\r\n  respective governments and duly registered and published.\r\n\r\n  ART. 14. A steam vessel proceeding under sail only, but having her\r\n  funnel up, shall carry in daytime forward, where it can best be seen,\r\n  one black ball or shape 2 feet in diameter.\r\n\r\n\r\n  SOUND SIGNALS FOR FOG, ETC.\r\n\r\n  ART. 15. All signals prescribed by this article for vessels under way\r\n  shall be given--\r\n\r\n  1. By \"steam vessels,\" on the whistle or siren.\r\n\r\n  2. By \"sailing vessels\" and \"vessels towed,\" on the fog horn.\r\n\r\n  The words \"prolonged blast\" used in this article shall mean a blast of\r\n  from four to six seconds' duration.\r\n\r\n  A steam vessel shall be provided with an efficient whistle or siren,\r\n  sounded by steam or by some substitute for steam, so placed that the\r\n  sound may not be intercepted by any obstruction, and with an efficient\r\n  fog horn, to be sounded by mechanical means, and also with an efficient\r\n  bell. (In all cases where the rules require a bell to be used a drum may\r\n  be substituted on board Turkish vessels or a gong where such articles\r\n  are used on board small seagoing vessels.) A sailing vessel of 20 tons\r\n  gross tonnage or upward shall be provided with a similar fog horn and\r\n  bell.\r\n\r\n  In fog, mist, falling snow, or heavy rain storms, whether by day or\r\n  night, the signals described in this article shall be used as follows,\r\n  viz:\r\n\r\n  (_a_) A steam vessel having way upon her shall sound at intervals\r\n  of not more than two minutes a prolonged blast.\r\n\r\n  (_b_) A steam vessel under way, but stopped and having no way upon\r\n  her, shall sound at intervals of not more than two minutes two prolonged\r\n  blasts with an interval of about one second between them.\r\n\r\n  (_c_) A sailing vessel under way shall sound at intervals of not\r\n  more than one minute, when on the starboard tack one blast, when on the\r\n  port tack two blasts in succession, and when with the wind abaft the\r\n  beam three blasts in succession.\r\n\r\n  (_d_) A vessel when at anchor shall at intervals of not more than\r\n  one minute ring the bell rapidly for about five seconds.\r\n\r\n  (_e_) A vessel at anchor at sea, when not in ordinary anchorage\r\n  ground and when in such a position as to be an obstruction to vessels\r\n  under way, shall sound, if a steam vessel, at intervals of not more than\r\n  two minutes, two prolonged blasts with her whistle or siren, followed by\r\n  ringing her bell; or, if a sailing vessel, at intervals of not more than\r\n  one minute two blasts with her fog horn, followed by ringing her bell.\r\n\r\n  (_f_) A vessel when towing shall, instead of the signals prescribed\r\n  in subdivisions (_a_) and (_c_) of this article, at intervals\r\n  of not more than two minutes sound three blasts in succession, namely,\r\n  one prolonged blast followed by two short blasts. A vessel towed may\r\n  give this signal, and she shall not give any other.\r\n\r\n  (_g_) A steam vessel wishing to indicate to another \"The way is off\r\n  my vessel; you may feel your way past me\" may sound three blasts in\r\n  succession, namely, short, long, short, with intervals of about one\r\n  second between them.\r\n\r\n  (_h_) A vessel employed in laying or picking up a telegraph cable\r\n  shall on hearing the fog signal of an approaching vessel sound in answer\r\n  three prolonged blasts in succession.\r\n\r\n  (_i_) A vessel under way which is unable to get out of the way of\r\n  an approaching vessel through being not under command or unable to\r\n  maneuver as required by these rules shall on hearing the fog signal of\r\n  an approaching vessel sound in answer four short blasts in succession.\r\n\r\n  Sailing vessels and boats of less than 20 tons gross tonnage shall not\r\n  be obliged to give the above-mentioned signals, but if they do not they\r\n  shall make some other efficient sound signal at intervals of not more\r\n  than one minute.\r\n\r\n\r\n  SPEED OF SHIPS TO BE MODERATE IN FOG, ETC.\r\n\r\n  ART. 16. Every vessel shall in a fog, mist, falling snow, or heavy rain\r\n  storm go at a moderate speed, having careful regard to the existing\r\n  circumstances and conditions.\r\n\r\n  A steam vessel hearing, apparently forward of her beam, the fog signal\r\n  of a vessel the position of which is not ascertained shall, so far as\r\n  the circumstances of the case admit, stop her engines, and then navigate\r\n  with caution until danger of collision is over.\r\n\r\n\r\n  STEERING AND SAILING RULES.\r\n\r\n  PRELIMINARY.--RISK OF COLLISION.\r\n\r\n  Risk of collision can, when circumstances permit, be ascertained by\r\n  carefully watching the compass bearing of an approaching vessel. If the\r\n  bearing does not appreciably change, such risk should be deemed to\r\n  exist.\r\n\r\n  ART. 17. When two sailing vessels are approaching one another so as to\r\n  involve risk of collision, one of them shall keep out of the way of the\r\n  other as follows, namely:\r\n\r\n  (_a_) A vessel which is running free shall keep out of the way of a\r\n  vessel which is closehauled.\r\n\r\n  (_b_) A vessel which is closehauled on the port tack shall keep out\r\n  of the way of a vessel which is closehauled on the starboard tack.\r\n\r\n  (_c_) When both are running free with the wind on different sides,\r\n  the vessel which has the wind on the port side shall keep out of the way\r\n  of the other.\r\n\r\n  (_d_) When both are running free with the wind on the same side,\r\n  the vessel which is to the windward shall keep out of the way of the\r\n  vessel which is to leeward.\r\n\r\n  (_e_) A vessel which has the wind aft shall keep out of the way of\r\n  the other vessel.\r\n\r\n  ART. 18. When two steam vessels are meeting end on or nearly end on, so\r\n  as to involve risk of collision, each shall alter her course to\r\n  starboard, so that each may pass on the port side of the other.\r\n\r\n  This article only applies to cases where vessels are meeting end on or\r\n  nearly end on in such a manner as to involve risk of collision, and does\r\n  not apply to two vessels which must if both keep on their respective\r\n  courses pass clear of each other.\r\n\r\n  The only cases to which it does apply are when each of the two vessels\r\n  is end on or nearly end on to the other; in other words, to cases in\r\n  which by day each vessel sees the masts of the other in a line or nearly\r\n  in a line with her own, and by night to cases in which each vessel is in\r\n  such a position as to see both the side lights of the other.\r\n\r\n  It does not apply by day to cases in which a vessel sees another ahead\r\n  crossing her own course, or by night to cases where the red light of one\r\n  vessel is opposed to the red light of the other, or where the green\r\n  light of one vessel is opposed to the green light of the other, or where\r\n  a red light without a green light or a green light without a red light\r\n  is seen ahead, or where both green and red lights are seen anywhere but\r\n  ahead.\r\n\r\n  ART. 19. When two steam vessels are crossing, so as to involve risk of\r\n  collision, the vessel which has the other on her own starboard side\r\n  shall keep out of the way of the other.\r\n\r\n  ART. 20. When a steam vessel and a sailing vessel are proceeding in such\r\n  directions as to involve risk of collision, the steam vessel shall keep\r\n  out of the way of the sailing vessel.\r\n\r\n  ART. 21. Where by any of these rules one of two vessels is to keep out\r\n  of the way, the other shall keep her course and speed.\r\n\r\n  ART. 22. Every vessel which is directed by these rules to keep out of\r\n  the way of another vessel shall, if the circumstances of the case admit,\r\n  avoid crossing ahead of the other.\r\n\r\n  ART. 23. Every steam vessel which is directed by these rules to keep out\r\n  of the way of another vessel shall on approaching her, if necessary,\r\n  slacken her speed or stop or reverse.\r\n\r\n  ART. 24. Notwithstanding anything contained in these rules every vessel\r\n  overtaking any other shall keep out of the way of the overtaken vessel.\r\n\r\n  Every vessel coming up with another vessel from any direction more than\r\n  2 points abaft her beam--that is, in such a position with reference to\r\n  the vessel which she is overtaking, that at night she would be unable to\r\n  see either of that vessel's side lights--shall be deemed to be an\r\n  overtaking vessel, and no subsequent alteration of the bearing between\r\n  the two vessels shall make the overtaking vessel a crossing vessel\r\n  within the meaning of these rules or relieve her of the duty of keeping\r\n  clear of the overtaken vessel until she is finally past and clear.\r\n\r\n  As by day the overtaking vessel can not always know with certainty\r\n  whether she is forward of or abaft this direction from the other vessel,\r\n  she should if in doubt assume that she is an overtaking vessel and keep\r\n  out of the way.\r\n\r\n  ART. 25. In narrow channels every steam vessel shall, when it is safe\r\n  and practicable, keep to that side of the fairway or mid-channel which\r\n  lies on the starboard side of such vessel.\r\n\r\n  ART. 26. Sailing vessels under way shall keep out of the way of sailing\r\n  vessels or boats fishing with nets or lines or trawls. This rule shall\r\n  not give to any vessel or boat engaged in fishing the right of\r\n  obstructing a fairway used by vessels other than fishing vessels or\r\n  boats.\r\n\r\n  ART. 27. In obeying and construing these rules due regard shall be had\r\n  to all dangers of navigation and collision and to any special\r\n  circumstances which may render a departure from the above rules\r\n  necessary in order to avoid immediate danger.\r\n\r\n\r\n  SOUND SIGNALS FOR VESSELS IN SIGHT OF ONE ANOTHER.\r\n\r\n  ART. 28. The words \"short blast\" used in this article shall mean a blast\r\n  of about one second's duration.\r\n\r\n  When vessels are in sight of one another, a steam vessel under way, in\r\n  taking any course authorized or required by these rules, shall indicate\r\n  that course by the following signals on her whistle or siren, namely:\r\n\r\n  One short blast to mean, \"I am directing my course to starboard.\"\r\n\r\n  Two short blasts to mean, \"I am directing my course to port.\"\r\n\r\n  Three short blasts to mean, \"My engines are going at full speed astern.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  NO VESSEL UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES TO NEGLECT PROPER PRECAUTIONS.\r\n\r\n  ART. 29. Nothing in these rules shall exonerate any vessel or the owner\r\n  or master or crew thereof from the consequences of any neglect to carry\r\n  lights or signals, or of any neglect to keep a proper lookout, or of the\r\n  neglect of any precaution which may be required by the ordinary practice\r\n  of seamen or by the special circumstances of the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n  RESERVATION OF RULES FOR HARBORS AND INLAND NAVIGATION.\r\n\r\n  ART. 30. Nothing in these rules shall interfere with the operation of a\r\n  special rule duly made by local authority relative to the navigation of\r\n  any harbor, river, or inland waters.\r\n\r\n\r\n  DISTRESS SIGNALS.\r\n\r\n  ART. 31. When a vessel is in distress and requires assistance from other\r\n  vessels or from the shore, the following shall be the signals to be used\r\n  or displayed by her, either together or separately, namely:\r\n\r\n  In the daytime--\r\n\r\n  First. A gun fired at intervals of about a minute.\r\n\r\n  Second. The international code signal of distress, indicated by N.C.\r\n\r\n  Third. The distance signal, consisting of a square flag, having either\r\n  above or below it a ball or anything resembling a ball.\r\n\r\n  Fourth. Rockets or shells as prescribed below for use at night.\r\n\r\n  Fifth. A continuous sounding with any fog-signal apparatus.\r\n\r\n  At night--\r\n\r\n  First. A gun fired at intervals of about a minute.\r\n\r\n  Second. Flames on the vessel (as from a burning tar barrel, oil barrel,\r\n  etc.).\r\n\r\n  Third. Rockets or shells bursting in the air with a loud report and\r\n  throwing stars of any color or description, fired one at a time at short\r\n  intervals.\r\n\r\n  Fourth. A continuous sounding with any fog-signal apparatus.\r\n\r\n  SEC. 2. That all laws or parts of laws inconsistent with the foregoing\r\n  regulations for preventing collisions at sea for the navigation of all\r\n  public and private vessels of the United States upon the high seas and\r\n  in all waters connected therewith navigable by seagoing vessels are\r\n  hereby repealed.\r\n\r\n  SEC. 3. That this act shall take effect at a time to be fixed by the\r\n  President by proclamation issued for that purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd whereas an act of Congress entitled \"An act to amend an act approved\r\nAugust 19, 1890, entitled 'An act to adopt regulations for preventing\r\ncollisions at sea,'\" was approved May 28, 1894, the said act being in\r\nthe following words:\r\n\r\n  _Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the\r\n  United States of America in Congress assembled_, That article 7 of\r\n  the act approved August 19, 1890, entitled \"An act to adopt regulations\r\n  for preventing collisions at sea,\" be amended to read as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"ART. 7. Steam vessels of less than 40 and vessels under oars or sails\r\n  of less than 20 tons gross tonnage, respectively, and rowing boats, when\r\n  under way, shall not be required to carry the lights mentioned in\r\n  article 2 (_a_), (_b_), and (_c_), but if they do not\r\n  carry them they shall be provided with the following lights:\r\n\r\n  \"First. Steam vessels of less than 40 tons shall carry--\r\n\r\n  \"(_a_) In the fore part of the vessel or on or in front of the\r\n  funnel where it can best be seen, and at a height above the gunwale of\r\n  not less than 9 feet, a bright white light constructed and fixed as\r\n  prescribed in article 2 (_a_) and of such a character as to be\r\n  visible at a distance of at least 2 miles.\r\n\r\n  \"(_b_) Green and red side lights constructed and fixed as\r\n  prescribed in article 2 (_b_) and (_c_) and of such a\r\n  character as to be visible at a distance of at least 1 mile, or a\r\n  combined lantern showing a green light and a red light from right ahead\r\n  to 2 points abaft the beam on their respective sides.

At the threshold of such labor\r\nnow to be undertaken by the Congress of the United States, and in the\r\ndischarge of an executive duty enjoined by the Constitution, I submit\r\nthis communication, containing a brief statement of the condition of\r\nour national affairs and recommending such legislation as seems to me\r\nnecessary and expedient.\r\n\r\nThe history of our recent dealings with other nations and our peaceful\r\nrelations with them at this time additionally demonstrate the advantage\r\nof consistently adhering to a firm but just foreign policy, free from\r\nenvious or ambitious national schemes and characterized by entire\r\nhonesty and sincerity.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year, pursuant to a law of Congress, commissioners were\r\nappointed to the Antwerp Industrial Exposition. Though the participation\r\nof American exhibitors fell far short of completely illustrating our\r\nnational ingenuity and industrial achievements, yet it was quite\r\ncreditable in view of the brief time allowed for preparation.\r\n\r\nI have endeavored to impress upon the Belgian Government the\r\nneedlessness and positive harmfulness of its restrictions upon the\r\nimportation of certain of our food products, and have strongly urged\r\nthat the rigid supervision and inspection under our laws are amply\r\nsufficient to prevent the exportation from this country of diseased\r\ncattle and unwholesome meat.\r\n\r\nThe termination of the civil war in Brazil has been followed by the\r\ngeneral prevalence of peace and order. It appearing at an early stage of\r\nthe insurrection that its course would call for unusual watchfulness on\r\nthe part of this Government, our naval force in the harbor of Rio de\r\nJaneiro was strengthened. This precaution, I am satisfied, tended to\r\nrestrict the issue to a simple trial of strength between the Brazilian\r\nGovernment and the insurgents and to avert complications which at times\r\nseemed imminent. Our firm attitude of neutrality was maintained to the\r\nend. The insurgents received no encouragement of eventual asylum from\r\nour commanders, and such opposition as they encountered was for the\r\nprotection of our commerce and was clearly justified by public law.\r\n\r\nA serious tension of relations having arisen at the close of the war\r\nbetween Brazil and Portugal by reason of the escape of the insurgent\r\nadmiral Da Gama and his followers, the friendly offices of our\r\nrepresentatives to those countries were exerted for the protection of\r\nthe subjects of either within the territory of the other.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Government of Brazil was duly notified that the commercial\r\narrangement existing between the United States and that country based on\r\nthe third section of the tariff act of 1890 was abrogated on August 28,\r\n1894, by the taking effect of the tariff law now in force, that\r\nGovernment subsequently notified us of its intention to terminate such\r\narrangement on the 1st day of January, 1895, in the exercise of the\r\nright reserved in the agreement between the two countries. I invite\r\nattention to the correspondence between the Secretary of State and the\r\nBrazilian minister on this subject.\r\n\r\nThe commission organized under the convention which we had entered\r\ninto with Chile for the settlement of the outstanding claims of each\r\nGovernment against the other adjourned at the end of the period\r\nstipulated for its continuance leaving undetermined a number of American\r\ncases which had been duly presented. These claims are not barred, and\r\nnegotiations are in progress for their submission to a new tribunal.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of March last a new treaty with China in further regulation\r\nof emigration was signed at Washington, and on August 13 it received the\r\nsanction of the Senate. Ratification on the part of China and formal\r\nexchange are awaited to give effect to this mutually beneficial\r\nconvention.\r\n\r\nA gratifying recognition of the uniform impartiality of this country\r\ntoward all foreign states was manifested by the coincident request of\r\nthe Chinese and Japanese Governments that the agents of the United\r\nStates should within proper limits afford protection to the subjects of\r\nthe other during the suspension of diplomatic relations due to a state\r\nof war. This delicate office was accepted, and a misapprehension which\r\ngave rise to the belief that in affording this kindly unofficial\r\nprotection our agents would exercise the same authority which the\r\nwithdrawn agents of the belligerents had exercised was promptly\r\ncorrected. Although the war between China and Japan endangers no policy\r\nof the United States, it deserves our gravest consideration by reason of\r\nits disturbance of our growing commercial interests in the two countries\r\nand the increased dangers which may result to our citizens domiciled or\r\nsojourning in the interior of China.\r\n\r\nActing under a stipulation in our treaty with Korea (the first concluded\r\nwith a western power), I felt constrained at the beginning of the\r\ncontroversy to tender our good offices to induce an amicable arrangement\r\nof the initial difficulty growing out of the Japanese demands for\r\nadministrative reforms in Korea, but the unhappy precipitation of actual\r\nhostilities defeated this kindly purpose.\r\n\r\nDeploring the destructive war between the two most powerful of the\r\neastern nations and anxious that our commercial interests in those\r\ncountries may be preserved and that the safety of our citizens there\r\nshall not be jeopardized, I would not hesitate to heed any intimation\r\nthat our friendly aid for the honorable termination of hostilities would\r\nbe acceptable to both belligerents.\r\n\r\nA convention has been finally concluded for the settlement by\r\narbitration of the prolonged dispute with Ecuador growing out of the\r\nproceedings against Emilio Santos, a naturalized citizen of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nOur relations with the Republic of France continue to be such as should\r\nexist between nations so long bound together by friendly sympathy and\r\nsimilarity in their form of government.\r\n\r\nThe recent cruel assassination of the President of this sister Republic\r\ncalled forth such universal expressions of sorrow and condolence from\r\nour people and Government as to leave no doubt of the depth and\r\nsincerity of our attachment. The resolutions passed by the Senate and\r\nHouse of Representatives on the occasion have been communicated to the\r\nwidow of President Carnot.\r\n\r\nActing upon the reported discovery of Texas fever in cargoes of American\r\ncattle, the German prohibition against importations of live stock and\r\nfresh meats from this country has been revived. It is hoped that Germany\r\nwill soon become convinced that the inhibition is as needless as it is\r\nharmful to mutual interests.\r\n\r\nThe German Government has protested against that provision of the\r\ncustoms tariff act which imposes a discriminating duty of one-tenth of\r\n1 cent a pound on sugars coming from countries paying an export bounty\r\nthereon, claiming that the exaction of such duty is in contravention of\r\nArticles V and IX of the treaty of 1828 with Prussia.\r\n\r\nIn the interests of the commerce of both countries and to avoid even the\r\naccusation of treaty violation, I recommend the repeal of so much of the\r\nstatute as imposes that duty, and I invite attention to the accompanying\r\nreport of the Secretary of State, containing a discussion of the\r\nquestions raised by the German protests.\r\n\r\nEarly in the present year an agreement was reached with Great Britain\r\nconcerning instructions to be given to the naval commanders of the two\r\nGovernments in Bering Sea and the contiguous North Pacific Ocean for\r\ntheir guidance in the execution of the award of the Paris Tribunal of\r\nArbitration and the enforcement of the regulations therein prescribed\r\nfor the protection of seal life in the waters mentioned. An\r\nunderstanding has also been reached for the payment by the United States\r\nof $425,000 in full satisfaction of all claims which may be made by\r\nGreat Britain for damages growing out of the controversy as to fur seals\r\nin Bering Sea or the seizure of British vessels engaged in taking seal\r\nin those waters. The award and findings of the Paris Tribunal to a great\r\nextent determined the facts and principles upon which these claims\r\nshould be adjusted, and they have been subjected by both Governments to\r\na thorough examination upon the principles as well as the facts which\r\nthey involve. I am convinced that a settlement upon the terms mentioned\r\nwould be an equitable and advantageous one, and I recommend that\r\nprovision be made for the prompt payment of the stated sum.\r\n\r\nThus far only France and Portugal have signified their willingness to\r\nadhere to the regulations established under the award of the Paris\r\nTribunal of Arbitration.\r\n\r\nPreliminary surveys of the Alaskan boundary and a preparatory\r\nexamination of the question of protection of food fish in the contiguous\r\nwaters of the United States and the Dominion of Canada are in progress.\r\n\r\nThe boundary of British Guiana still remains in dispute between Great\r\nBritain and Venezuela. Believing that its early settlement on some just\r\nbasis alike honorable to both parties is in the line of our established\r\npolicy to remove from this hemisphere all causes of difference with\r\npowers beyond the sea, I shall renew the efforts heretofore made to\r\nbring about a restoration of diplomatic relations between the disputants\r\nand to induce a reference to arbitration--a resort which Great Britain\r\nso conspicuously favors in principle and respects in practice and which\r\nis earnestly sought by her weaker adversary.\r\n\r\nSince communicating the voluminous correspondence in regard to Hawaii\r\nand the action taken by the Senate and House of Representatives on\r\ncertain questions submitted to the judgment and wider discretion of\r\nCongress the organization of a government in place of the provisional\r\narrangement which followed the deposition of the Queen has been\r\nannounced, with evidence of its effective operation. The recognition\r\nusual in such cases has been accorded the new Government.\r\n\r\nUnder our present treaties of extradition with Italy miscarriages\r\nof justice have occurred owing to the refusal of that Government to\r\nsurrender its own subjects. Thus far our efforts to negotiate an amended\r\nconvention obviating this difficulty have been unavailing.\r\n\r\nApart from the war in which the Island Empire is engaged, Japan attracts\r\nincreasing attention in this country by her evident desire to cultivate\r\nmore liberal intercourse with us and to seek our kindly aid in\r\nfurtherance of her laudable desire for complete autonomy in her domestic\r\naffairs and full equality in the family of nations. The Japanese Empire\r\nof to-day is no longer the Japan of the past, and our relations with\r\nthis progressive nation should not be less broad and liberal than those\r\nwith other powers.\r\n\r\nGood will, fostered by many interests in common, has marked our\r\nrelations with our nearest southern neighbor. Peace being restored along\r\nher northern frontier, Mexico has asked the punishment of the late\r\ndisturbers of her tranquillity. There ought to be a new treaty of\r\ncommerce and navigation with that country to take the place of the one\r\nwhich terminated thirteen years ago. The friendliness of the intercourse\r\nbetween the two countries is attested by the fact that during this long\r\nperiod the commerce of each has steadily increased under the rule of\r\nmutual consideration, being neither stimulated by conventional\r\narrangements nor retarded by jealous rivalries or selfish distrust.\r\n\r\nAn indemnity tendered by Mexico as a gracious act for the murder in 1887\r\nof Leon Baldwin, an American citizen, by a band of marauders in Durango\r\nhas been accepted and is being paid in installments.\r\n\r\nThe problem of the storage and use of the waters of the Rio Grande for\r\nirrigation should be solved by appropriate concurrent action of the two\r\ninterested countries. Rising in the Colorado heights, the stream flows\r\nintermittently, yielding little water during the dry months to the\r\nirrigation channels already constructed along its course. This scarcity\r\nis often severely felt in the regions where the river forms a common\r\nboundary. Moreover, the frequent changes in its course through level\r\nsands often raise embarrassing questions of territorial jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nProminent among the questions of the year was the Bluefields incident,\r\nin what is known as the Mosquito Indian Strip, bordering on the Atlantic\r\nOcean and within the jurisdiction of Nicaragua. By the treaty of 1860\r\nbetween Great Britain and Nicaragua the former Government expressly\r\nrecognized the sovereignty of the latter over the strip, and a limited\r\nform of self-government was guaranteed to the Mosquito Indians, to be\r\nexercised according to their customs, for themselves and other dwellers\r\nwithin its limits. The so-called native government, which grew to be\r\nlargely made up of aliens, for many years disputed the sovereignty of\r\nNicaragua over the strip and claimed the right to maintain therein a\r\npractically independent municipal government. Early in the past year\r\nefforts of Nicaragua to maintain sovereignty over the Mosquito territory\r\nled to serious disturbances, culminating in the suppression of the\r\nnative government and the attempted substitution of an impracticable\r\ncomposite administration in which Nicaragua and alien residents were to\r\nparticipate. Failure was followed by an insurrection, which for a time\r\nsubverted Nicaraguan rule, expelling her officers and restoring the old\r\norganization. This in turn gave place to the existing local government\r\nestablished and upheld by Nicaragua.\r\n\r\nAlthough the alien interests arrayed against Nicaragua in these\r\ntransactions have been largely American and the commerce of that region\r\nfor some time has been and still is chiefly controlled by our citizens,\r\nwe can not for that reason challenge the rightful sovereignty of\r\nNicaragua over this important part of her domain.\r\n\r\nFor some months one, and during part of the time two, of our naval ships\r\nhave been stationed at Bluefields for the protection of all legitimate\r\ninterests of our citizens. In September last the Government at Managua\r\nexpelled from its territory twelve or more foreigners, including two\r\nAmericans, for alleged participation in the seditious or revolutionary\r\nmovements against the Republic at Bluefields already mentioned; but\r\nthrough the earnest remonstrance of this Government the two Americans\r\nhave been permitted to return to the peaceful management of their\r\nbusiness. Our naval commanders at the scene of these disturbances by\r\ntheir constant exhibition of firmness and good judgment contributed\r\nlargely to the prevention of more serious consequences and to the\r\nrestoration of quiet and order. I regret that in the midst of these\r\noccurrences there happened a most grave and irritating failure of\r\nNicaraguan justice. An American citizen named Wilson, residing at Rama,\r\nin the Mosquito territory, was murdered by one Argüello, the acting\r\ngovernor of the town. After some delay the murderer was arrested, but so\r\ninsecurely confined or guarded that he escaped, and notwithstanding our\r\nrepeated demands it is claimed that his recapture has been impossible by\r\nreason of his flight beyond Nicaraguan jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nThe Nicaraguan authorities, having given notice of forfeiture of their\r\nconcession to the canal company on grounds purely technical and not\r\nembraced in the contract, have receded from that position.\r\n\r\nPeru, I regret to say, shows symptoms of domestic disturbance, due\r\nprobably to the slowness of her recuperation from the distresses of\r\nthe war of 1881. Weakened in resources, her difficulties in facing\r\ninternational obligations invite our kindly sympathy and justify our\r\nforbearance in pressing long-pending claims. I have felt constrained\r\nto testify this sympathy in connection with certain demands urgently\r\npreferred by other powers.\r\n\r\nThe recent death of the Czar of Russia called forth appropriate\r\nexpressions of sorrow and sympathy on the part of our Government with\r\nhis bereaved family and the Russian people. As a further demonstration\r\nof respect and friendship our minister at St. Petersburg was directed to\r\nrepresent our Government at the funeral ceremonies.\r\n\r\nThe sealing interests of Russia in Bering Sea are second only to our\r\nown. A _modus vivendi_ has therefore been concluded with the\r\nImperial Government restrictive of poaching on the Russian rookeries and\r\nof sealing in waters which were not comprehended in the protected area\r\ndefined in the Paris award.\r\n\r\nOccasion has been found to urge upon the Russian Government equality of\r\ntreatment for our great life-insurance companies whose operations have\r\nbeen extended throughout Europe. Admitting as we do foreign corporations\r\nto transact business in the United States, we naturally expect no less\r\ntolerance for our own in the ample fields of competition abroad.\r\n\r\nBut few cases of interference with naturalized citizens returning to\r\nRussia have been reported during the current year. One Krzeminski was\r\narrested last summer in a Polish province on a reported charge of\r\nunpermitted renunciation of Russian allegiance, but it transpired\r\nthat the proceedings originated in alleged malfeasance committed by\r\nKrzeminski while an imperial official a number of years ago. Efforts for\r\nhis release, which promised to be successful, were in progress when his\r\ndeath was reported.\r\n\r\nThe Government of Salvador having been overthrown by an abrupt popular\r\noutbreak, certain of its military and civil officers, while hotly\r\npursued by infuriated insurgents, sought refuge on board the United\r\nStates war ship _Bennington_, then lying in a Salvadorean port.\r\nAlthough the practice of asylum is not favored by this Government, yet\r\nin view of the imminent peril which threatened the fugitives and solely\r\nfrom considerations of humanity they were afforded shelter by our naval\r\ncommander, and when afterwards demanded under our treaty of extradition\r\nwith Salvador for trial on charges of murder, arson, and robbery I\r\ndirected that such of them as had not voluntarily left the ship be\r\nconveyed to one of our nearest ports where a hearing could be had before\r\na judicial officer, in compliance with the terms of the treaty. On their\r\narrival at San Francisco such a proceeding was promptly instituted\r\nbefore the United States district judge, who held that the acts\r\nconstituting the alleged offenses were political and discharged all the\r\naccused except one Cienfuegos, who was held for an attempt to murder.\r\nThereupon I was constrained to direct his release for the reason that an\r\nattempt to murder was not one of the crimes charged against him and upon\r\nwhich his surrender to the Salvadorean authorities had been demanded.\r\n\r\nUnreasonable and unjust fines imposed by Spain on the vessels and\r\ncommerce of the United States have demanded from time to time during the\r\nlast twenty years earnest remonstrance on the part of our Government.\r\nIn the immediate past exorbitant penalties have been imposed upon our\r\nvessels and goods by customs authorities of Cuba and Puerto Rico for\r\nclerical errors of the most trivial character in the manifests or bills\r\nof lading. In some cases fines amounting to thousands of dollars have\r\nbeen levied upon cargoes or the carrying vessels when the goods in\r\nquestion were entitled to free entry. Fines have been exacted even when\r\nthe error had been detected and the Spanish authorities notified before\r\nthe arrival of the goods in port.\r\n\r\nThis conduct is in strange contrast with the considerate and liberal\r\ntreatment extended to Spanish vessels and cargoes in our ports in like\r\ncases. No satisfactory settlement of these vexatious questions has yet\r\nbeen reached.\r\n\r\nThe Mora case, referred to in my last annual message, remains unsettled.\r\nFrom the diplomatic correspondence on this subject which has been laid\r\nbefore the Senate it will be seen that this Government has offered to\r\nconclude a convention with Spain for disposal by arbitration of\r\noutstanding claims between the two countries, except the Mora claim,\r\nwhich, having been long ago adjusted, now only awaits payment as\r\nstipulated, and of course it could not be included in the proposed\r\nconvention. It was hoped that this offer would remove parliamentary\r\nobstacles encountered by the Spanish Government in providing payment of\r\nthe Mora indemnity. I regret to say that no definite reply to this offer\r\nhas yet been made and all efforts to secure payment of this settled\r\nclaim have been unavailing.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message I adverted to the claim on the part of Turkey\r\nof the right to expel as persons undesirable and dangerous Armenians\r\nnaturalized in the United States and returning to Turkish\r\njurisdiction.[9] Numerous questions in this relation have arisen. While\r\nthis Government acquiesces in the asserted right of expulsion, it will\r\nnot consent that Armenians may be imprisoned or otherwise punished for\r\nno other reason than having acquired without imperial consent American\r\ncitizenship.\r\n\r\nThree of the assailants of Miss Melton, an American teacher in Mosul,\r\nhave been convicted by the Ottoman courts, and I am advised that an\r\nappeal against the acquittal of the remaining five has been taken by the\r\nTurkish prosecuting officer.\r\n\r\nA convention has been concluded with Venezuela for the arbitration of a\r\nlong-disputed claim growing out of the seizure of certain vessels the\r\nproperty of citizens of the United States. Although signed, the treaty\r\nof extradition with Venezuela is not yet in force, owing to the\r\ninsistence of that Government that when surrendered its citizens shall\r\nin no case be liable to capital punishment.\r\n\r\nThe rules for the prevention of collisions at sea which were framed\r\nby the maritime conference held in this city in 1889, having been\r\nconcurrently incorporated in the statutes of the United States and\r\nGreat Britain, have been announced to take effect March 1, 1895, and\r\ninvitations have been extended to all maritime nations to adhere to\r\nthem. Favorable responses have thus far been received from Austria,\r\nFrance, Portugal, Spain, and Sweden.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message I referred briefly to the unsatisfactory state\r\nof affairs in Samoa under the operation of the Berlin treaty as signally\r\nillustrating the impolicy of entangling alliances with foreign\r\npowers,[10] and on May 9, 1894, in response to a resolution of the\r\nSenate, I sent a special message [11] and documents to that body on the\r\nsame subject, which emphasized my previously expressed opinions. Later\r\noccurrences, the correspondence in regard to which will be laid before\r\nthe Congress, further demonstrate that the Government which was devised\r\nby the three powers and forced upon the Samoans against their inveterate\r\nhostility can be maintained only by the continued presence of foreign\r\nmilitary force and at no small sacrifice of life and treasure.\r\n\r\nThe suppression of the Mataafa insurrection by the powers and the\r\nsubsequent banishment of the leader and eleven other chiefs, as recited\r\nin my last message, did not bring lasting peace to the islands.\r\nFormidable uprisings continued, and finally a rebellion broke out in\r\nthe capital island, Upolu, headed in Aana, the western district, by the\r\nyounger Tamasese, and in Atua, the eastern district, by other leaders.\r\nThe insurgents ravaged the country and fought the Government's troops\r\nup to the very doors of Apia. The King again appealed to the powers\r\nfor help, and the combined British and German naval forces reduced the\r\nAtuans to apparent subjection, not, however, without considerable loss\r\nto the natives. A few days later Tamasese and his adherents, fearing the\r\nships and the marines, professed submission.\r\n\r\nReports received from our agents at Apia do not justify the belief\r\nthat the peace thus brought about will be of long duration. It is\r\ntheir conviction that the natives are at heart hostile to the present\r\nGovernment, that such of them as profess loyalty to it do so from fear\r\nof the powers, and that it would speedily go to pieces if the war ships\r\nwere withdrawn. In reporting to his Government on the unsatisfactory\r\nsituation since the suppression of the late revolt by foreign armed\r\nforces, the German consul at Apia stated:\r\n\r\n  That peace will be lasting is hardly to be presumed. The lesson given\r\n  by firing on Atua was not sufficiently sharp and incisive to leave\r\n  a lasting impression on the forgetful Samoan temperament. In fact,\r\n  conditions are existing which show that peace will not last and is not\r\n  seriously intended. Malietoa, the King, and his chiefs are convinced\r\n  that the departure of the war ships will be a signal for a renewal of\r\n  war. The circumstance that the representatives of the villages of all\r\n  the districts which were opposed to the Government have already\r\n  withdrawn to Atua to hold meetings, and that both Atua and Aana have\r\n  forbidden inhabitants of those districts which fought on the side of the\r\n  Government to return to their villages, and have already partly burned\r\n  down the latter, indicates that a real conciliation of the parties is\r\n  still far off.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd in a note of the 10th ultimo, inclosing a copy of that report for\r\nthe information of this Government, the German ambassador said:\r\n\r\n  The contents of the report awakened the Imperial Government's\r\n  apprehension that under existing circumstances the peace concluded\r\n  with the rebels will afford no assurance of the lasting restoration\r\n  of tranquillity in the islands.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe present Government has utterly failed to correct, if indeed it has\r\nnot aggravated, the very evils it was intended to prevent. It has not\r\nstimulated our commerce with the islands. Our participation in its\r\nestablishment against the wishes of the natives was in plain defiance of\r\nthe conservative teachings and warnings of the wise and patriotic men\r\nwho laid the foundations of our free institutions, and I invite an\r\nexpression of the judgment of Congress on the propriety of steps being\r\ntaken by this Government looking to the withdrawal from its engagements\r\nwith the other powers on some reasonable terms not prejudicial to any of\r\nour existing rights.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Treasury reports that the receipts of the\r\nGovernment from all sources of revenue during the fiscal year ending\r\nJune 30, 1894, amounted to $372,802,498.29 and its expenditures to\r\n$442,605,758.87, leaving a deficit of $69,803,260.58. There was a\r\ndecrease of $15,952,674.66 in the ordinary expense of the Government as\r\ncompared with the fiscal year 1893.\r\n\r\nThere was collected from customs $131,818,530.62 and from internal\r\nrevenue $147,168,449.70. The balance of the income for the year,\r\namounting to $93,815,517.97, was derived from the sales of lands and\r\nother sources.\r\n\r\nThe value of our total dutiable imports amounted to $275,199,086, being\r\n$146,657,625 less than during the preceding year, and the importations\r\nfree of duty amounted to $379,795,536, being $64,748,675 less than\r\nduring the preceding year. The receipts from customs were $73,536,486.11\r\nless and from internal revenue $13,836,539.97 less than in 1893.\r\n\r\nThe total tax collected from distilled spirits was $85,259,250.25, on\r\nmanufactured tobacco $28,617,898.62, and on fermented liquors\r\n$31,414,788.04.\r\n\r\nOur exports of merchandise, domestic and foreign, amounted during the\r\nyear to $892,140,572, being an increase over the preceding year of\r\n$44,495,378.\r\n\r\nThe total amount of gold exported during the fiscal year was\r\n$76,898,061, as against $108,680,444 during the fiscal year 1893. The\r\namount imported was $72,449,119, as against $21,174,381 during the\r\nprevious year.\r\n\r\nThe imports of silver were $13,286,552 and the exports were $50,451,265.\r\n\r\nThe total bounty paid upon the production of sugar in the United\r\nStates for the fiscal year was $12,100,208.89, being an increase of\r\n$2,725,078.01 over the payments made during the preceding year. The\r\namount of bounty paid from July 1, 1894, to August 28, 1894, the time\r\nwhen further payments ceased by operation of law, was $966,185.84. The\r\ntotal expenses incurred in the payment of the bounty upon sugar during\r\nthe fiscal year was $130,140.85.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that upon the basis of the present revenue laws the\r\nreceipts of the Government during the current fiscal year, ending June\r\n30, 1895, will be $424,427,748.44 and its expenditures $444,427,748.44,\r\nresulting in a deficit of $20,000,000.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st day of November, 1894, the total stock of money of all kinds\r\nin the country was $2,240,773,888, as against $2,204,651,000 on the 1st\r\nday of November, 1893, and the money of all kinds in circulation, or not\r\nincluded in the Treasury holdings, was $1,672,093,422, or $24.27 per\r\ncapita upon an estimated population of 68,887,000. At the same date\r\nthere was held in the Treasury gold bullion amounting to $44,615,177.55\r\nand silver bullion which was purchased at a cost of $127,772,988. The\r\npurchase of silver bullion under the act of July 14, 1890, ceased on the\r\n1st day of November, 1893, and up to that time there had been purchased\r\nduring the fiscal year 11,917,658.78 fine ounces, at a cost of\r\n$8,715,521.32, an average cost of $O.7313 per fine ounce. The total\r\namount of silver purchased from the time that law took effect until the\r\nrepeal of its purchasing clause, on the date last mentioned, was\r\n168,674,682.53 fine ounces, which cost $155,931,002.25, the average\r\nprice per fine ounce being $0.9244.\r\n\r\nThe total amount of standard silver dollars coined at the mints of the\r\nUnited States since the passage of the act of February 28, 1878, is\r\n$421,776,408, of which $378,166,793 were coined under the provisions of\r\nthat act, $38,531,143 under the provisions of the act of July 14, 1890,\r\nand $5,078,472 under the act providing for the coinage of trade-dollar\r\nbullion.\r\n\r\nThe total coinage of all metals at our mints during the last fiscal year\r\nconsisted of 63,485,220 pieces, valued at $106,216,730.06, of which\r\nthere were $99,474,912.50 in gold coined, $758 in standard silver\r\ndollars, $6,024,140.30 in subsidiary silver coin, and $716,919.26 in\r\nminor coin.\r\n\r\nDuring the calendar year 1893 the production of precious metals in the\r\nUnited States was estimated at 1,739,323 fine ounces of gold of the\r\ncommercial and coinage value of $35,955,000 and 60,000,000 fine ounces\r\nof silver of the bullion or market value of $46,800,000 and of the\r\ncoinage value of $77,576,000. It is estimated that on the 1st day of\r\nJuly, 1894, the stock of metallic money in the United States, consisting\r\nof coin and bullion, amounted to $1,251,640,958, of which $627,923,201\r\nwas gold and $624,347,757 was silver.\r\n\r\nFifty national banks were organized during the year ending October\r\n31, 1894, with a capital of $5,285,000, and 79, with a capital of\r\n$10,475,000, went into voluntary liquidation. Twenty-one banks, with a\r\ncapital of $2,770,000, were placed in the hands of receivers. The total\r\nnumber of national banks in existence on the 31st day of October last\r\nwas 3,756, being 40 less than on the 31st day of October, 1893. The\r\ncapital stock paid in was $672,671,365, being $9,678,491 less than at\r\nthe same time in the previous year, and the surplus fund and individual\r\nprofits, less expenses and taxes paid, amounted to $334,121,082.10,\r\nwhich was $16,089,780 less than on October 31, 1893. The circulation was\r\ndecreased $1,741,563. The obligations of the banks to each other were\r\nincreased $117,268,334 and the individual deposits were $277,294,489\r\nless than at the corresponding date in the previous year. Loans and\r\ndiscounts were $161,206,923 more than at the same time the previous\r\nyear, and checks and other cash items were $90,349,963 more. The total\r\nresources of the banks at the date mentioned amounted to $3,473,922,055,\r\nas against $3,109,563,284.36 in 1893.\r\n\r\nFrom the report of the Secretary of War it appears that the strength of\r\nthe Army on September 30, 1894, was 2,135 officers and 25,765 enlisted\r\nmen. Although this is apparently a very slight decrease compared with\r\nthe previous year, the actual effective force has been increased to the\r\nequivalent of nearly two regiments through the reorganization of the\r\nsystem of recruiting and the consequent release to regimental duty of\r\nthe large force of men hitherto serving at the recruiting depots. The\r\nabolition of these depots, it is predicted, will furthermore effect an\r\nannual reduction approximating $250,000 in the direct expenditures,\r\nbesides promoting generally the health, morale, and discipline of the\r\ntroops.\r\n\r\nThe execution of the policy of concentrating the Army at important\r\ncenters of population and transportation, foreshadowed in the last\r\nannual report of the Secretary, has resulted in the abandonment of\r\nfifteen of the smaller posts, which was effected under a plan which\r\nassembles organizations of the same regiments hitherto widely separated.\r\nThis renders our small forces more readily effective for any service\r\nwhich they may be called upon to perform, increases the extent of the\r\nterritory under protection without diminishing the security heretofore\r\nafforded to any locality, improves the discipline, training, and\r\n_esprit de corps_ of the Army, besides considerably decreasing the\r\ncost of its maintenance.\r\n\r\nThough the forces of the Department of the East have been somewhat\r\nincreased, more than three-fourths of the Army is still stationed west\r\nof the Mississippi. This carefully matured policy, which secures the\r\nbest and greatest service in the interests of the general welfare from\r\nthe small force comprising our Regular Army, should not be thoughtlessly\r\nembarrassed by the creation of new and unnecessary posts through acts of\r\nCongress to gratify the ambitions or interests of localities.\r\n\r\nWhile the maximum legal strength of the Army is 25,000 men, the\r\neffective strength, through various causes, is but little over 20,000\r\nmen. The purpose of Congress does not, therefore, seem to be fully\r\nattained by the existing condition. While no considerable increase in\r\nthe Army is, in my judgment, demanded by recent events, the policy of\r\nseacoast fortification, in the prosecution of which we have been\r\nsteadily engaged for some years, has so far developed as to suggest that\r\nthe effective strength of the Army be now made at least equal to the\r\nlegal strength. Measures taken by the Department during the year, as\r\nindicated, have already considerably augmented the effective force,\r\nand the Secretary of War presents a plan, which I recommend to the\r\nconsideration of Congress, to attain the desired end. Economies effected\r\nin the Department in other lines of its work will offset to a great\r\nextent the expenditure involved in the proposition submitted. Among\r\nother things this contemplates the adoption of the three-battalion\r\nformation of regiments, which for several years has been indorsed by\r\nthe Secretaries of War and the Generals Commanding the Army. Compact\r\nin itself, it provides a skeleton organization, ready to be filled out\r\nin the event of war, which is peculiarly adapted to our strength and\r\nrequirements; and the fact that every other nation, with a single\r\nexception, has adopted this formation to meet the conditions of\r\nmodern warfare should alone secure for the recommendation an early\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to recall the fact that in obedience to the\r\ncommands of the Constitution and the laws, and for the purpose of\r\nprotecting the property of the United States, aiding the process of\r\nFederal courts, and removing lawless obstructions to the performance\r\nby the Government of its legitimate functions, it became necessary in\r\nvarious localities during the year to employ a considerable portion of\r\nthe regular troops. The duty was discharged promptly, courageously, and\r\nwith marked discretion by the officers and men, and the most gratifying\r\nproof was thus afforded that the Army deserves that complete confidence\r\nin its efficiency and discipline which the country has at all times\r\nmanifested.\r\n\r\nThe year has been free from disturbances by Indians, and the chances of\r\nfurther depredations on their part are constantly becoming more remote\r\nand improbable.\r\n\r\nThe total expenditures for the War Department for the year ended June\r\n30, 1894, amounted to $56,039,009.34. Of this sum $2,000,614.99 was for\r\nsalaries and contingent expenses, $23,665,156.16 for the support of the\r\nmilitary establishment, $5,001,682.23 for miscellaneous objects, and\r\n$25,371,555.96 for public works. This latter sum includes $19,494,037.49\r\nfor river and harbor improvements and $3,947,863.56 for fortifications\r\nand other works of defense. The appropriations for the current year\r\naggregate $52,429,112.78, and the estimates submitted by the Secretary\r\nof War for the next fiscal year call for appropriations amounting to\r\n$52,318,629.55.\r\n\r\nThe skill and industry of our ordnance officers and inventors have, it\r\nis believed, overcome the mechanical obstacles which have heretofore\r\ndelayed the armament of our coasts, and this great national undertaking\r\nupon which we have entered may now proceed as rapidly as Congress shall\r\ndetermine. With a supply of finished guns of large caliber already\r\non hand, to which additions should now rapidly follow, the wisdom of\r\nproviding carriages and emplacements for their mount can not be too\r\nstrongly urged.\r\n\r\nThe total enrollment of the militia of the several States is 117,533\r\nofficers and enlisted men, an increase of 5,343 over the number reported\r\nat the close of the previous year. The reports of militia inspections by\r\nRegular Army officers show a marked increase in interest and efficiency\r\namong the State organizations, and I strongly recommend a continuance of\r\nthe policy of affording every practical encouragement possible to this\r\nimportant auxiliary of our military establishment.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the Apache Indians held as prisoners by the Government\r\nfor eight years at a cost of half a million dollars has been changed\r\nduring the year from captivity to one which gives them an opportunity\r\nto demonstrate their capacity for self-support and at least partial\r\ncivilization. Legislation enacted at the late session of Congress gave\r\nthe War Department authority to transfer the survivors, numbering 346,\r\nfrom Mount Vernon Barracks, in Alabama, to any suitable reservation. The\r\nDepartment selected as their future home the military lands near Fort\r\nSill, Ind. T., where, under military surveillance, the former prisoners\r\nhave been established in agriculture under conditions favorable to their\r\nadvancement.\r\n\r\nIn recognition of the long and distinguished military services and\r\nfaithful discharge of delicate and responsible civil duties by\r\nMajor-General John M. Schofield, now the General Commanding the Army,\r\nit is suggested to Congress that the temporary revival of the grade of\r\nlieutenant-general in his behalf would be a just and gracious act and\r\nwould permit his retirement, now near at hand, with rank befitting his\r\nmerits.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Attorney-General notes the gratifying progress made\r\nby the Supreme Court in overcoming the arrears of its business and in\r\nreaching a condition in which it will be able to dispose of cases as\r\nthey arise without any unreasonable delay. This result is of course very\r\nlargely due to the successful working of the plan inaugurating circuit\r\ncourts of appeals. In respect to these tribunals the suggestion is made\r\nin quarters entitled to the highest consideration that an additional\r\ncircuit judge for each circuit would greatly strengthen these courts and\r\nthe confidence reposed in their adjudications, and that such an addition\r\nwould not create a greater force of judges than the increasing business\r\nof such courts requires. I commend the suggestion to the careful\r\nconsideration of the Congress. Other important topics are adverted to\r\nin the report, accompanied by recommendations, many of which have been\r\ntreated at large in previous messages, and at this time, therefore, need\r\nonly be named. I refer to the abolition of the fee system as a measure\r\nof compensation to Federal officers; the enlargement of the powers of\r\nUnited States commissioners, at least in the Territories; the allowance\r\nof writs of error in criminal cases on behalf of the United States, and\r\nthe establishment of degrees in the crime of murder. A topic dealt\r\nwith by the Attorney-General of much importance is the condition of\r\nthe administration of justice in the Indian Territory. The permanent\r\nsolution of what is called the Indian problem is probably not to be\r\nexpected at once, but meanwhile such ameliorations of present conditions\r\nas the existing system will admit of ought not to be neglected. I am\r\nsatisfied there should be a Federal court established for the Territory,\r\nwith sufficient judges, and that this court should sit within the\r\nTerritory and have the same jurisdiction as to Territorial affairs as\r\nis now vested in the Federal courts sitting in Arkansas and Texas.\r\n\r\nAnother subject of pressing moment referred to by the Attorney-General\r\nis the reorganization of the Union Pacific Railway Company on a basis\r\nequitable as regards all private interests and as favorable to the\r\nGovernment as existing conditions will permit. The operation of a\r\nrailroad by a court through a receiver is an anomalous state of things\r\nwhich should be terminated on all grounds, public and private, at the\r\nearliest possible moment. Besides, not to enact the needed enabling\r\nlegislation at the present session postpones the whole matter until\r\nthe assembling of a new Congress and inevitably increases all the\r\ncomplications of the situation, and could not but be regarded as a\r\nsignal failure to solve a problem which has practically been before\r\nthe present Congress ever since its organization.\r\n\r\nEight years ago in my annual message I urged upon the Congress as\r\nStrongly as I could the location and construction of two prisons for the\r\nconfinement of United States prisoners.[12] A similar recommendation has\r\nbeen made from time to time since, and a few years ago a law was passed\r\nproviding for the selection of sites for three such institutions. No\r\nappropriation has, however, been made to carry the act into effect, and\r\nthe old and discreditable condition still exists.\r\n\r\nIt is not my purpose at this time to repeat the considerations which\r\nmake an impregnable case in favor of the ownership and management by the\r\nGovernment of the penal institutions in which Federal prisoners are\r\nconfined. I simply desire to again urge former recommendations on the\r\nsubject and to particularly call the attention of the Congress to that\r\npart of the report of the Secretary of War in which he states that the\r\nmilitary prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kans., can be turned over to the\r\nGovernment as a prison for Federal convicts without the least difficulty\r\nand with an actual saving of money from every point of view.\r\n\r\nPending a more complete reform, I hope that by the adoption of the\r\nsuggestion of the Secretary of War this easy step may be taken in the\r\ndirection of the proper care of its convicts by the Government of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster-General presents a comprehensive statement\r\nof the operations of the Post-Office Department for the last fiscal\r\nyear. The receipts of the Department during the year amounted to\r\n$75,080,479.04 and the expenditures to $84,324,414.15.\r\n\r\nThe transactions of the postal service indicate with barometric\r\ncertainty the fluctuations in the business of the country. Inasmuch,\r\ntherefore, as business complications continued to exist throughout\r\nthe last year to an unforeseen extent, it is not surprising that the\r\ndeficiency of revenue to meet the expenditures of the Post-Office\r\nDepartment, which was estimated in advance at about $8,000,000, should\r\nbe exceeded by nearly $1,225,000. The ascertained revenues of the last\r\nyear, which were the basis of calculation for the current year, being\r\nless than estimated, the deficiency for the current year will be\r\ncorrespondingly greater, though the Postmaster-General states that the\r\nlatest indications are so favorable that he confidently predicts an\r\nincrease of at least 8 per cent in the revenues of the current year over\r\nthose of the last year.\r\n\r\nThe expenditures increase steadily and necessarily with the growth and\r\nneeds of the country, so that the deficiency is greater or less in any\r\nyear, depending upon the volume of receipts.\r\n\r\nThe Postmaster-General states that this deficiency is unnecessary and\r\nmight be obviated at once if the law regulating rates upon mail matter\r\nof the second class was modified. The rate received for the transmission\r\nof this second-class matter is 1 cent per pound, while the cost of such\r\ntransmission to the Government is eight times that amount. In the\r\ngeneral terms of the law this rate covers newspapers and periodicals.\r\nThe extensions of the meaning of these terms from time to time have\r\nadmitted to the privileges intended for legitimate newspapers and\r\nperiodicals a surprising range of publications and created abuses the\r\ncost of which amounts in the aggregate to the total deficiency of the\r\nPost-Office Department. Pretended newspapers are started by business\r\nhouses for the mere purpose of advertising goods, complying with the law\r\nin form only and discontinuing the publications as soon as the period of\r\nadvertising is over. \"Sample copies\" of pretended newspapers are issued\r\nin great numbers for a like purpose only. The result is a great loss of\r\nrevenue to the Government, besides its humiliating use as an agency to\r\naid in carrying out the scheme of a business house to advertise its\r\ngoods by means of a trick upon both its rival houses and the regular\r\nand legitimate newspapers. Paper-covered literature, consisting mainly\r\nof trashy novels, to the extent of many thousands of tons is sent\r\nthrough the mails at 1 cent per pound, while the publishers of standard\r\nworks are required to pay eight times that amount in sending their\r\npublications. Another abuse consists in the free carriage through the\r\nmails of hundreds of tons of seed and grain uselessly distributed\r\nthrough the Department of Agriculture. The Postmaster-General predicts\r\nthat if the law be so amended as to eradicate these abuses not only will\r\nthe Post-Office Department show no deficiency, but he believes that in\r\nthe near future all legitimate newspapers and periodical magazines might\r\nbe properly transmitted through the mails to their subscribers free of\r\ncost. I invite your prompt consideration of this subject and fully\r\nindorse the views of the Postmaster-General.\r\n\r\nThe total number of post-offices in the United States on the 30th day of\r\nJune, 1894, was 69,805, an increase of 1,403 over the preceding year. Of\r\nthese, 3,428 were Presidential, an increase in that class of 68 over the\r\npreceding year.\r\n\r\nSix hundred and ten cities and towns are provided with free delivery.\r\nNinety-three other cities and towns entitled to this service under the\r\nlaw have not been accorded it on account of insufficient funds. The\r\nexpense of free delivery for the current fiscal year will be more than\r\n$12,300,000, and under existing legislation this item of expenditure is\r\nsubject to constant increase. The estimated cost of rural free delivery\r\ngenerally is so very large that it ought not to be considered in the\r\npresent condition of affairs.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 830 additional domestic money-order offices were\r\nestablished. The total number of these offices at the close of the year\r\nwas 19,264. There were 14,304,041 money orders issued during the year,\r\nbeing an increase over the preceding year of 994,306. The value of these\r\norders amounted to $138,793,579.49, an increase of $11,217,145.84. There\r\nwere also issued during the year postal notes amounting to\r\n$12,649,094.55.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 218 international money-order offices were added to\r\nthose already established, making a total of 2,625 such offices in\r\noperation June 30, 1894. The number of international money orders issued\r\nduring the year was 917,823, a decrease in number of 138,176, and their\r\nvalue was $13,792,455.31, a decrease in amount of $2,549,382.55. The\r\nnumber of orders paid was 361,180, an increase over the preceding year\r\nof 60,263, and their value was $6,568,493.78, an increase of\r\n$1,285,118.08.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing statements it appears that the total issue of money\r\norders and postal notes for the year amounted to $165,235,129.35.\r\n\r\nThe number of letters and packages mailed during the year for special\r\ndelivery was 3,436,970. The special-delivery stamps used upon these\r\nletters and packages amounted to $343,697. The messengers' fees paid for\r\ntheir delivery amounted to $261,209.70, leaving a balance in favor of\r\nthe Government of $82,487.30.\r\n\r\nThe report shows most gratifying results in the way of economies worked\r\nout without affecting the efficiency of the postal service. These\r\nconsist in the abrogation of steamship subsidy contracts, reletting of\r\nmail transportation contracts, and in the cost and amount of supplies\r\nused in the service, amounting in all to $16,619,047.42.\r\n\r\nThis report also contains a valuable contribution to the history of the\r\nUniversal Postal Union, an arrangement which amounts practically to\r\nthe establishment of one postal system for the entire civilized world.\r\nSpecial attention is directed to this subject at this time in view of\r\nthe fact that the next congress of the union will meet in Washington in\r\n1897, and it is hoped that timely action will be taken in the direction\r\nof perfecting preparations for that event.\r\n\r\nThe Postmaster-General renews the suggestion made in a previous report\r\nthat the Department organization be increased to the extent of creating\r\na direct district supervision of all postal affairs, and in this\r\nsuggestion I fully concur.\r\n\r\nThere are now connected with the Post-Office establishment 32,661\r\nemployees who are in the classified service. This includes many who have\r\nbeen classified upon the suggestion of the Postmaster-General. He states\r\nthat another year's experience at the head of the Department serves only\r\nto strengthen the conviction as to the excellent working of the\r\ncivil-service law in this branch of the public service.\r\n\r\nAttention is called to the report of the Secretary of the Navy, which\r\nshows very gratifying progress in the construction of ships for our new\r\nNavy. All the vessels now building, including the three torpedo boats\r\nauthorized at the last session of Congress and excepting the first-class\r\nbattle ship _Iowa_, will probably be completed during the coming\r\nfiscal year.\r\n\r\nThe estimates for the increase of the Navy for the year ending June 30,\r\n1896, are large, but they include practically the entire sum necessary\r\nto complete and equip all the new ships not now in commission, so that\r\nunless new ships are authorized the appropriations for the naval service\r\nfor the fiscal year ending June 30, 1897, should fall below the\r\nestimates for the coming year by at least $12,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary presents with much earnestness a plea for the authorization\r\nof three additional battle ships and ten or twelve torpedo boats. While\r\nthe unarmored vessels heretofore authorized, including those now nearing\r\ncompletion, will constitute a fleet which it is believed is sufficient\r\nfor ordinary cruising purposes in time of peace, we have now completed\r\nand in process of construction but four first-class battle ships and\r\nbut few torpedo boats. If we are to have a navy for warlike operations,\r\noffensive and defensive, we certainly ought to increase both the number\r\nof battle ships and torpedo boats.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of armor requires expensive plants and the aggregation\r\nof many skilled workmen. All the armor necessary to complete the vessels\r\nnow building will be delivered before the 1st of June next. If no new\r\ncontracts are given out, contractors must disband their workmen and\r\ntheir plants must lie idle. Battle ships authorized at this time would\r\nnot be well under way until late in the coming fiscal year, and at least\r\nthree years and a half from the date of the contract would be required\r\nfor their completion. The Secretary states that not more than 15 per\r\ncent of the cost of such ships need be included in the appropriations\r\nfor the coming year.\r\n\r\nI recommend that provision be made for the construction of additional\r\nbattle ships and torpedo boats.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary recommends the manufacture not only of a reserve supply of\r\nordnance and ordnance material for ships of the Navy, but also a supply\r\nfor the auxiliary fleet. Guns and their appurtenances should be provided\r\nand kept on hand for both these purposes. We have not to-day a single\r\ngun that could be put upon the ships _Paris_ or _New York_ of the\r\nInternational Navigation Company or any other ship of our reserve Navy.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of guns at the Washington Navy-Yard is proceeding\r\nsatisfactorily, and none of our new ships will be required to wait for\r\ntheir guns or ordnance equipment.\r\n\r\nAn important order has been issued by the Secretary of the Navy\r\ncoordinating the duties of the several bureaus concerned in the\r\nconstruction of ships. This order, it is believed, will secure to a\r\ngreater extent than has heretofore been possible the harmonious action\r\nof these several bureaus and make the attainment of the best results\r\nmore certain.\r\n\r\nDuring the past fiscal year there has been an unusual and pressing\r\ndemand in many quarters of the world for the presence of vessels to\r\nguard American interests.\r\n\r\nIn January last, during the Brazilian insurrection, a large fleet was\r\nconcentrated in the harbor of Rio de Janeiro. The vigorous action of\r\nRear-Admiral Benham in protecting the personal and commercial rights of\r\nour citizens during the disturbed conditions afforded results which\r\nwill, it is believed, have a far-reaching and wholesome influence\r\nwhenever in like circumstances it may become necessary for our naval\r\ncommanders to interfere on behalf of our people in foreign ports.\r\n\r\nThe war now in progress between China and Japan has rendered it\r\nnecessary or expedient to dispatch eight vessels to those waters.\r\n\r\nBoth the Secretary of the Navy and the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nrecommend the transfer of the work of the Coast Survey proper to the\r\nNavy Department. I heartily concur in this recommendation. Excluding\r\nAlaska and a very small area besides, all the work of mapping and\r\ncharting our coasts has been completed. The hydrographic work, which\r\nmust be done over and over again by reason of the shifting and varying\r\ndepths of water consequent upon the action of streams and tides,\r\nhas heretofore been done under the direction of naval officers in\r\nsubordination to the Superintendent of the Coast Survey. There seems to\r\nbe no good reason why the Navy should not have entire charge hereafter\r\nof such work, especially as the Hydrographic Office of the Navy\r\nDepartment is now and has been for many years engaged in making\r\nefficient maps entirely similar to those prepared by the Coast Survey.\r\n\r\nI feel it my imperative duty to call attention to the recommendation of\r\nthe Secretary in regard to the personnel of the line of the Navy. The\r\nstagnation of promotion in this the vital branch of the service is so\r\ngreat as to seriously impair its efficiency.\r\n\r\nI consider it of the utmost importance that the young and middle-aged\r\nofficers should before the eve of retirement be permitted to reach a\r\ngrade entitling them to active and important duty.\r\n\r\nThe system adopted a few years ago regulating the employment of labor\r\nat the navy-yards is rigidly upheld and has fully demonstrated its\r\nusefulness and expediency. It is within the domain of civil-service\r\nreform inasmuch as workmen are employed through a board of labor\r\nselected at each navy-yard and are given work without reference to\r\npolitics and in the order of their application, preference, however,\r\nbeing given to Army and Navy veterans and those having former navy-yard\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nAmendments suggested by experience have been made to the rules\r\nregulating the system. Through its operation the work at our navy-yards\r\nhas been vastly improved in efficiency and the opportunity to work has\r\nbeen honestly and fairly awarded to willing and competent applicants.\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that if this system continues to be strictly adhered to\r\nthere will soon be as a natural consequence such an equalization of\r\nparty benefit as will remove all temptation to relax or abandon it.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Interior exhibits the situation of\r\nthe numerous and interesting branches of the public service connected\r\nwith his Department. I commend this report and the valuable\r\nrecommendations of the Secretary to the careful attention of the\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nThe public land disposed of during the year amounted to 10,406,100.77\r\nacres, including 28,876.05 of Indian lands.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that the public domain still remaining amounts to\r\na little more than 600,000,000 acres, including, however, about\r\n360,000,000 acres in Alaska, as well as military reservations and\r\nrailroad and other selections of lands yet unadjudicated.\r\n\r\nThe total cash receipts from sale of lands amounted to $2,674,285.79,\r\nincluding $91,981.03 received for Indian lands.\r\n\r\nThirty-five thousand patents were issued for agricultural lands, and\r\n3,100 patents were issued to Indians on allotments of their holdings\r\nin severalty, the land so allotted being inalienable by the Indian\r\nallottees for a period of twenty-five years after patent.\r\n\r\nThere were certified and patented on account of railroad and wagon-road\r\ngrants during the year 865,556.45 acres of land, and at the close of the\r\nyear 29,000,000 acres were embraced in the lists of selections made by\r\nrailroad and wagon-road companies and awaited settlement.\r\n\r\nThe selections of swamp lands and that taken as indemnity therefor since\r\nthe passage of the act providing for the same in 1849 amount to nearly\r\nor quite 80,500,000 acres, of which 58,000,000 have been patented to\r\nStates. About 138,000 acres were patented during the last year. Nearly\r\n820,000 acres of school and education grants were approved during the\r\nyear, and at its close 1,250,363.81 acres remained unadjusted.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the appropriation for the current year on account of\r\nspecial service for the protection of the public lands and the timber\r\nthereon is much less than those for previous years, and inadequate for\r\nan efficient performance of the work. A larger sum of money than has\r\nbeen appropriated during a number of years past on this account has been\r\nreturned to the Government as a result of the labors of those employed\r\nin the particular service mentioned, and I hope it will not be crippled\r\nby insufficient appropriation.\r\n\r\nI fully indorse the recommendation of the Secretary that adequate\r\nprotection be provided for our forest reserves and that a comprehensive\r\nforestry system be inaugurated. Such keepers and superintendents as are\r\nnecessary to protect the forests already reserved should be provided.\r\nI am of the opinion that there should be an abandonment of the policy\r\nsanctioned by present laws under which the Government, for a very small\r\nconsideration, is rapidly losing title to immense tracts of land covered\r\nwith timber, which should be properly reserved as permanent sources of\r\ntimber supply.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion that a change be made in the manner of securing surveys\r\nof the public lands is especially worthy of consideration. I am\r\nsatisfied that these surveys should be made by a corps of competent\r\nsurveyors under the immediate control and direction of the Commissioner\r\nof the General Land Office.\r\n\r\nAn exceedingly important recommendation of the Secretary relates to the\r\nmanner in which contests and litigated cases growing out of efforts to\r\nobtain Government land are determined. The entire testimony upon which\r\nthese controversies depend in all their stages is taken before the\r\nlocal registers and receivers, and yet these officers have no power\r\nto subpoena witnesses or to enforce their attendance to testify. These\r\ncases, numbering three or four thousand annually, are sent by the local\r\nofficers to the Commissioner of the General Land Office for his action.\r\nThe exigencies of his other duties oblige him to act upon the decisions\r\nof the registers and receivers without an opportunity of thorough\r\npersonal examination. Nearly 2,000 of these cases are appealed annually\r\nfrom the Commissioner to the Secretary of the Interior. Burdened with\r\nother important administrative duties, his determination of these\r\nappeals must be almost perfunctory and based upon the examination of\r\nothers, though this determination of the Secretary operates as a final\r\nadjudication upon rights of very great importance.\r\n\r\nI concur in the opinion that the Commissioner of the General Land Office\r\nshould be relieved from the duty of deciding litigated land cases, that\r\na nonpartisan court should be created to pass on such cases, and that\r\nthe decisions of this court should be final, at least so far as the\r\ndecisions of the Department are now final. The proposed court might be\r\ngiven authority to certify questions of law in matters of especial\r\nimportance to the Supreme Court of the United States or the court of\r\nappeals for the District of Columbia for decision. The creation of such\r\na tribunal would expedite the disposal of cases and insure decisions of\r\na more satisfactory character. The registers and receivers who\r\noriginally hear and decide these disputes should be invested with\r\nauthority to compel witnesses to attend and testify before them.\r\n\r\nThough the condition of the Indians shows a steady and healthy progress,\r\ntheir situation is not satisfactory at all points. Some of them to whom\r\nallotments of land have been made are found to be unable or disinclined\r\nto follow agricultural pursuits or to otherwise beneficially manage\r\ntheir land. This is especially true of the Cheyennes and Arapahoes, who,\r\nas it appears by reports of their agent, have in many instances never\r\nbeen located upon their allotments, and in some cases do not even know\r\nwhere their allotments are. Their condition has deteriorated. They are\r\nnot self-supporting and they live in camps and spend their time in\r\nidleness.\r\n\r\nI have always believed that allotments of reservation lands to Indians\r\nin severalty should be made sparingly, or at least slowly, and with\r\nthe utmost caution. In these days, when white agriculturists and stock\r\nraisers of experience and intelligence find their lot a hard one, we\r\nought not to expect Indians, unless far advanced in civilization and\r\nhabits of industry, to support themselves on the small tracts of land\r\nusually allotted to them.\r\n\r\nIf the self-supporting scheme by allotment fails, the wretched pauperism\r\nof the allottees which results is worse than their original condition\r\nof regulated dependence. It is evident that the evil consequences of\r\nill-advised allotment are intensified in cases where the false step\r\ncan not be retraced on account of the purchase by the Government\r\nof reservation lands remaining after allotments are made and the\r\ndisposition of such remaining lands to settlers or purchasers from\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\nI am convinced that the proper solution of the Indian problem and the\r\nsuccess of every step taken in that direction depend to a very large\r\nextent upon the intelligence and honesty of the reservation agents and\r\nthe interest they have in their work. An agent fitted for his place can\r\ndo much toward preparing the Indians under his charge for citizenship\r\nand allotment of their lands, and his advice as to any matter concerning\r\ntheir welfare will not mislead. An unfit agent will make no effort\r\nto advance the Indians on his reservation toward civilization or\r\npreparation for allotment of lands in severalty, and his opinion as to\r\ntheir condition in this and other regards is heedless and valueless.\r\n\r\nThe indications are that the detail of army officers as Indian agents\r\nwill result in improved management on the reservations.\r\n\r\nWhenever allotments are made and any Indian on the reservation has\r\npreviously settled upon a lot and cultivated it or shown a disposition\r\nto improve it in any way, such lot should certainly be allotted to him,\r\nand this should be made plainly obligatory by statute.\r\n\r\nIn the light of experience and considering the uncertainty of the Indian\r\nsituation and its exigencies in the future, I am not only disposed to\r\nbe very cautious in making allotments, but I incline to agree with the\r\nSecretary of the Interior in the opinion that when allotments are made\r\nthe balance of reservation land remaining after allotment, instead of\r\nbeing bought by the Government from the Indians and opened for\r\nsettlement with such scandals and unfair practices as seem unavoidable,\r\nshould remain for a time at least as common land or be sold by the\r\nGovernment on behalf of the Indians in an orderly way and at fixed\r\nprices, to be determined by its location and desirability, and that the\r\nproceeds, less expenses, should be held in trust for the benefit of the\r\nIndian proprietors.\r\n\r\nThe intelligent Indian-school management of the past year has been\r\nfollowed by gratifying results. Efforts have been made to advance the\r\nwork in a sound and practical manner. Five institutes of Indian teachers\r\nhave been held during the year, and have proved very beneficial through\r\nthe views exchanged and methods discussed particularly applicable to\r\nIndian education.\r\n\r\nEfforts are being made in the direction of a gradual reduction of the\r\nnumber of Indian contract schools, so that in a comparatively short time\r\nthey may give way altogether to Government schools, and it is hoped\r\nthat the change may be so gradual as to be perfected without too great\r\nexpense to the Government or undue disregard of investments made by\r\nthose who have established and are maintaining such contract schools.\r\n\r\nThe appropriation for the current year, ending June 30, 1895, applicable\r\nto the ordinary expenses of the Indian service amounts to $6,733,003.18,\r\nbeing less by $663,240.64 than the sum appropriated on the same account\r\nfor the previous year.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the last fiscal year, on the 30th day of June, 1894,\r\nthere were 969,544 persons on our pension rolls, being a net increase\r\nof 3,532 over the number reported at the end of the previous year.\r\n\r\nThese pensioners may be classified as follows: Soldiers and sailors\r\nsurvivors of all wars, 753,968; widows and relatives of deceased\r\nsoldiers, 215,162; army nurses in the War of the Rebellion, 414. Of\r\nthese pensioners 32,039 are surviving soldiers of Indian and other\r\nwars prior to the late Civil War and the widows or relatives of such\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\nThe remainder, numbering 937,505, are receiving pensions on account of\r\nthe rebellion, and of these 469,344 are on the rolls under the authority\r\nof the act of June 27, 1890, sometimes called the dependent-pension law.\r\n\r\nThe total amount expended for pensions during the year was\r\n$139,804,461.05, leaving an unexpended balance from the sum appropriated\r\nof $25,205,712.65.\r\n\r\nThe sum necessary to meet pension expenditures for the year ending June\r\n30, 1896, is estimated at $140,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner of Pensions is of the opinion that the year 1895,\r\nbeing the thirtieth after the close of the War of the Rebellion, must,\r\naccording to all sensible human calculation, see the highest limit of\r\nthe pension roll, and that after that year it must begin to decline.\r\n\r\nThe claims pending in the Bureau have decreased more than 90,000 during\r\nthe year. A large proportion of the new claims filed are for increase of\r\npension by those now on the rolls.\r\n\r\nThe number of certificates issued was 80,213.\r\n\r\nThe names dropped from the rolls for all causes during the year numbered\r\n37,951.\r\n\r\nAmong our pensioners are 9 widows and 3 daughters of soldiers of the\r\nRevolution and 45 survivors of the War of 1812.\r\n\r\nThe barefaced and extensive pension frauds exposed under the direction\r\nof the courageous and generous veteran soldier now at the head of the\r\nBureau leave no room for the claim that no purgation of our pension\r\nrolls was needed or that continued vigilance and prompt action are not\r\nnecessary to the same end.\r\n\r\nThe accusation that an effort to detect pension frauds is evidence of\r\nunfriendliness toward our worthy veterans and a denial of their claims\r\nto the generosity of the Government suggests an unfortunate indifference\r\nto the commission of any offense which has for its motive the securing\r\nof a pension and indicates a willingness to be blind to the existence\r\nof mean and treacherous crimes which play upon demagogic fears and make\r\nsport of the patriotic impulse of a grateful people.\r\n\r\nThe completion of the Eleventh Census is now in charge of the\r\nCommissioner of Labor. The total disbursements on account of the work\r\nfor the fiscal year ending June 30, 1894, amounted to $10,365,676.81.\r\nAt the close of the year the number of persons employed in the Census\r\nOffice was 679; at present there are about 400. The whole number of\r\nvolumes necessary to comprehend the Eleventh Census will be 25, and they\r\nwill contain 22,270 printed pages. The assurance is confidently made\r\nthat before the close of the present calendar year the material still\r\nincomplete will be practically in hand, and the census can certainly be\r\nclosed by the 4th of March, 1895. After that the revision and proof\r\nreading necessary to bring out the volumes will still be required.\r\n\r\nThe text of the census volumes has been limited as far as possible to\r\nthe analysis of the statistics presented. This method, which is in\r\naccordance with law, has caused more or less friction and in some\r\ninstances individual disappointment, for when the Commissioner of Labor\r\ntook charge of the work he found much matter on hand which according\r\nto this rule he was compelled to discard. The census is being prepared\r\naccording to the theory that it is designed to collect facts and certify\r\nthem to the public, not to elaborate arguments or to present personal\r\nviews.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of Agriculture in his report reviews the operations of his\r\nDepartment for the last fiscal year and makes recommendations for the\r\nfurther extension of its usefulness. He reports a saving in expenditures\r\nduring the year of $600,000, which is covered back into the Treasury.\r\nThis sum is 23 per cent of the entire appropriation.\r\n\r\nA special study has been made of the demand for American farm products\r\nin all foreign markets, especially Great Britain. That country received\r\nfrom the United States during the nine months ending September 30, 1894,\r\n305,910 live beef cattle, valued at $26,500,000, as against 182,611\r\ncattle, valued at $16,634,000, during the same period for 1893.\r\n\r\nDuring the first six months of 1894 the United Kingdom took also\r\n112,000,000 pounds of dressed beef from the United States, valued at\r\nnearly $10,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe report shows that during the nine months immediately preceding\r\nSeptember 30, 1894, the United States exported to Great Britain\r\n222,676,000 pounds of pork; of apples, 1,900,000 bushels, valued at\r\n$2,500,000, and of horses 2,811, at an average value of $139 per head.\r\nThere was a falling off in American wheat exports of 13,500,000 bushels,\r\nand the Secretary is inclined to believe that wheat may not in the\r\nfuture be the staple export cereal product of our country, but that corn\r\nwill continue to advance in importance as an export on account of the\r\nnew uses to which it is constantly being appropriated.\r\n\r\nThe exports of agricultural products from the United States for the\r\nfiscal year ending June 30, 1894, amounted to $628,363,038, being 72.28\r\nper cent of American exports of every description, and the United\r\nKingdom of Great Britain took more than 54 per cent of all farm products\r\nfinding foreign markets.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Agriculture has undertaken during the year two new\r\nand important lines of research. The first relates to grasses and forage\r\nplants, with the purpose of instructing and familiarizing the people as\r\nto the distinctive grasses of the United States and teaching them how to\r\nintroduce valuable foreign forage plants which may be adapted to this\r\ncountry. The second relates to agricultural soils and crop production,\r\ninvolving the analyses of samples of soils from all sections of the\r\nAmerican Union, to demonstrate their adaptability to particular plants\r\nand crops. Mechanical analyses of soils may be of such inestimable\r\nutility that it is foremost in the new lines of agricultural research,\r\nand the Secretary therefore recommends that a division having it in\r\ncharge be permanently established in the Department.\r\n\r\nThe amount appropriated for the Weather Bureau was $951,100. Of that sum\r\n$138,500, or 14 per cent, has been saved and is returned to the Treasury.\r\n\r\nAs illustrating the usefulness of this service it may be here stated\r\nthat the warnings which were very generally given of two tropical storms\r\noccurring in September and October of the present year resulted in\r\ndetaining safely in port 2,305 vessels, valued at $36,283,913, laden\r\nwith cargoes of probably still greater value. What is much more\r\nimportant and gratifying, many human lives on these ships were also\r\nundoubtedly saved.\r\n\r\nThe appropriation to the Bureau of Animal Industry was $850,000, and the\r\nexpenditures for the year were only $495,429.24, thus leaving unexpended\r\n$354,570.76. The inspection of beef animals for export and interstate\r\ntrade has been continued, and 12,944,056 head were inspected during the\r\nyear, at a cost of 1-3/4 cents per head, against 4-3/4 cents for 1893.\r\nThe amount of pork microscopically examined was 35,437,937 pounds,\r\nagainst 20,677,410 pounds in the preceding year. The cost of this\r\ninspection has been diminished from 8-3/4 cents per head in 1893 to\r\n6-1/2 cents in 1894.\r\n\r\nThe expense of inspecting the pork sold in 1894 to Germany and France by\r\nthe United States was $88,922.10. The quantity inspected was greater by\r\n15,000,000 pounds than during the preceding year, when the cost of such\r\ninspection was $172,367.08. The Secretary of Agriculture recommends\r\nthat the law providing for the microscopic inspection of export and\r\ninterstate meat be so amended as to compel owners of the meat inspected\r\nto pay the cost of such inspection, and I call attention to the\r\narguments presented in his report in support of this recommendation.\r\n\r\nThe live beef cattle exported and tagged during the year numbered\r\n353,535. This is an increase of 69,533 head over the previous year.\r\n\r\nThe sanitary inspection of cattle shipped to Europe has cost an average\r\nof 10-3/4 cents for each animal, and the cost of inspecting Southern\r\ncattle and the disinfection of cars and stock yards averages 2.7 cents\r\nper animal.\r\n\r\nThe scientific inquiries of the Bureau of Animal Industry have\r\nprogressed steadily during the year. Much tuberculin and mallein have\r\nbeen furnished to State authorities for use in the agricultural colleges\r\nand experiment stations for the treatment of tuberculosis and glanders.\r\n\r\nQuite recently this Department has published the results of its\r\ninvestigations of bovine tuberculosis, and its researches will be\r\nvigorously continued. Certain herds in the District of Columbia will be\r\nthoroughly inspected and will probably supply adequate scope for the\r\nDepartment to intelligently prosecute its scientific work and furnish\r\nsufficient material for purposes of illustration, description, and\r\ndefinition.\r\n\r\nThe sterilization of milk suspected of containing the bacilli of\r\ntuberculosis has been during the year very thoroughly explained in a\r\nleaflet by Dr. D.E. Salmon, the Chief of the Bureau, and given general\r\ncirculation throughout the country.\r\n\r\nThe Office of Experiment Stations, which is a part of the United States\r\nDepartment of Agriculture, has during the past year engaged itself\r\nalmost wholly in preparing for publication works based upon the reports\r\nof agricultural experiment stations and other institutions for\r\nagricultural inquiry in the United States and foreign countries.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary in his report for 1893 called attention to the fact that\r\nthe appropriations made for the support of the experiment stations\r\nthroughout the Union were the only moneys taken out of the National\r\nTreasury by act of Congress for which no accounting to Federal\r\nauthorities was required. Responding to this suggestion, the Fifty-third\r\nCongress, in making the appropriation for the Department for the present\r\nfiscal year, provided that--\r\n\r\n  The Secretary of Agriculture shall prescribe the form of annual\r\n  financial statement required by section 3 of said act of March 2, 1887;\r\n  shall ascertain whether the expenditures under the appropriation hereby\r\n  made are in accordance with the provisions of said act, and shall make\r\n  report thereon to Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn obedience to this law the Department of Agriculture immediately sent\r\nout blank forms of expense accounts to each station, and proposes in\r\naddition to make, through trusted experts, systematic examination of\r\nthe several stations during each year for the purpose of acquiring by\r\npersonal investigation the detailed information necessary to enable\r\nthe Secretary of Agriculture to make, as the statute provides, a\r\nsatisfactory report to Congress. The boards of management of the\r\nseveral stations with great alacrity and cordiality have approved the\r\namendment to the law providing this supervision of their expenditures,\r\nanticipating that it will increase the efficiency of the stations and\r\nprotect their directors and managers from loose charges concerning their\r\nuse of public funds, besides bringing the Department of Agriculture into\r\ncloser and more confidential relations with the experimental stations,\r\nand through their joint service largely increasing their usefulness to\r\nthe agriculture of the country.\r\n\r\nActing upon a recommendation contained in the report of 1893, Congress\r\nappropriated $10,000 \"to enable the Secretary of Agriculture to\r\ninvestigate and report upon the nutritive value of the various articles\r\nand commodities used for human food, with special suggestions of full,\r\nwholesome, and edible rations less wasteful and more economical than\r\nthose in common use.\"\r\n\r\nUnder this appropriation the Department has prepared and now has nearly\r\nready for distribution an elementary discussion of the nutritive value\r\nand pecuniary economy of food. When we consider that fully one-half of\r\nall the money earned by the wage earners of the civilized world is\r\nexpended by them for food, the importance and utility of such an\r\ninvestigation is apparent.\r\n\r\nThe Department expended in the fiscal year 1893 $2,354,809.56, and\r\nout of that sum the total amount expended in scientific research was\r\n45.6 per cent. But in the year ending June 30, 1894, out of a total\r\nexpenditure of $1,948,988.38, the Department applied 51.8 per cent of\r\nthat sum to scientific work and investigation. It is therefore very\r\nplainly observable that the economies which have been practiced in\r\nthe administration of the Department have not been at the expense of\r\nscientific research.\r\n\r\nThe recommendation contained in the report of the Secretary for 1893\r\nthat the vicious system of promiscuous free distribution of its\r\ndepartmental documents be abandoned is again urged. These publications\r\nmay well be furnished without cost to public libraries, educational\r\ninstitutions, and the officers and libraries of States and of the\r\nFederal Government; but from all individuals applying for them a price\r\ncovering the cost of the document asked for should be required. Thus the\r\npublications and documents would be secured by those who really desire\r\nthem for proper purposes. Half a million of copies of the report of the\r\nSecretary of Agriculture are printed for distribution, at an annual cost\r\nof about $300,000. Large numbers of them are cumbering storerooms at the\r\nCapitol and the shelves of secondhand-book stores throughout the\r\ncountry. All this labor and waste might be avoided if the\r\nrecommendations of the Secretary were adopted.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary also again recommends that the gratuitous distribution of\r\nseeds cease and that no money be appropriated for that purpose except to\r\nexperiment stations. He reiterates the reasons given in his report for\r\n1893 for discontinuing this unjustifiable gratuity, and I fully concur\r\nin the conclusions which he has reached.\r\n\r\nThe best service of the statistician of the Department of Agriculture\r\nis the ascertainment, by diligence and care, of the actual and real\r\nconditions, favorable or unfavorable, of the farmers and farms of the\r\ncountry, and to seek the causes which produce these conditions, to the\r\nend that the facts ascertained may guide their intelligent treatment.\r\n\r\nA further important utility in agricultural statistics is found in their\r\nelucidation of the relation of the supply of farm products to the demand\r\nfor them in the markets of the United States and of the world.\r\n\r\nIt is deemed possible that an agricultural census may be taken each year\r\nthrough the agents of the statistical division of the Department. Such a\r\ncourse is commended for trial by the chief of that division. Its scope\r\nwould be:\r\n\r\n(1) The area under each of the more important crops. (2) The aggregate\r\nproducts of each of such crops. (3) The quantity of wheat and corn in\r\nthe hands of farmers at a date after the spring sowings and plantings\r\nand before the beginning of harvest, and also the quantity of cotton and\r\ntobacco remaining in the hands of planters, either at the same date or\r\nat some other designated time.\r\n\r\nThe cost of the work is estimated at $500,000.\r\n\r\nOwing to the peculiar quality of the statistician's work and the natural\r\nand acquired fitness necessary to its successful prosecution, the\r\nSecretary of Agriculture expresses the opinion that every person\r\nemployed in gathering statistics under the chief of that division should\r\nbe admitted to that service only after a thorough, exhaustive, and\r\nsuccessful examination at the hands of the United States Civil Service\r\nCommission. This has led him to call for such examination of candidates\r\nfor the position of assistant statisticians, and also of candidates for\r\nchiefs of sections in that division.\r\n\r\nThe work done by the Department of Agriculture is very superficially\r\ndealt with in this communication, and I commend the report of the\r\nSecretary and the very important interests with which it deals to the\r\ncareful attention of the Congress.\r\n\r\nThe advantages to the public service of an adherence to the principles\r\nof civil-service reform are constantly more apparent, and nothing\r\nis so encouraging to those in official life who honestly desire good\r\ngovernment as the increasing appreciation by our people of these\r\nadvantages. A vast majority of the voters of the land are ready to\r\ninsist that the time and attention of those they select to perform for\r\nthem important public duties should not be distracted by doling out\r\nminor offices, and they are growing to be unanimous in regarding party\r\norganization as something that should be used in establishing party\r\nprinciples instead of dictating the distribution of public places as\r\nrewards of partisan activity.\r\n\r\nNumerous additional offices and places have lately been brought within\r\ncivil-service rules and regulations, and some others will probably soon\r\nbe included.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Commissioners will be submitted to the Congress, and\r\nI invite careful attention to the recommendations it contains.\r\n\r\nI am entirely convinced that we ought not to be longer without a\r\nnational board of health or national health officer charged with no\r\nother duties than such as pertain to the protection of our country\r\nfrom the invasion of pestilence and disease. This would involve the\r\nestablishment by such board or officer of proper quarantine precautions,\r\nor the necessary aid and counsel to local authorities on the subject;\r\nprompt advice and assistance to local boards of health or health\r\nofficers in the suppression of contagious disease, and in cases where\r\nthere are no such local boards or officers the immediate direction by\r\nthe national board or officer of measures of suppression; constant and\r\nauthentic information concerning the health of foreign countries and\r\nall parts of our own country as related to contagious diseases, and\r\nconsideration of regulations to be enforced in foreign ports to prevent\r\nthe introduction of contagion into our cities and the measures which\r\nshould be adopted to secure their enforcement.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be at this time a decided inclination to discuss measures\r\nof protection against contagious diseases in international conference,\r\nwith a view of adopting means of mutual assistance. The creation of such\r\na national health establishment would greatly aid our standing in such\r\nconferences and improve our opportunities to avail ourselves of their\r\nbenefits.\r\n\r\nI earnestly recommend the inauguration of a national board of health\r\nor similar national instrumentality, believing the same to be a needed\r\nprecaution against contagious disease and in the interest of the safety\r\nand health of our people.\r\n\r\nBy virtue of a statute of the United States passed in 1888 I appointed\r\nin July last Hon. John D. Kernan, of the State of New York, and Hon.\r\nNicholas E. Worthington, of the State of Illinois, to form, with Hon.\r\nCarroll D. Wright, Commissioner of Labor, who was designated by said\r\nstatute, a commission for the purpose of making careful inquiry into\r\nthe causes of the controversies between certain railroads and their\r\nemployees which had resulted in an extensive and destructive strike,\r\naccompanied by much violence and dangerous disturbance, with\r\nconsiderable loss of life and great destruction of property.\r\n\r\nThe report of the commissioners has been submitted to me and will be\r\ntransmitted to the Congress with the evidence taken upon their\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nTheir work has been well done, and their standing and intelligence give\r\nassurance that the report and suggestions they make are worthy of\r\ncareful consideration.\r\n\r\nThe tariff act passed at the last session of the Congress needs\r\nimportant amendments if it is to be executed effectively and with\r\ncertainty. In addition to such necessary amendments as will not change\r\nrates of duty, I am still very decidedly in favor of putting coal and\r\niron upon the free list.\r\n\r\nSo far as the sugar schedule is concerned, I would be glad, under\r\nexisting aggravations, to see every particle of differential duty in\r\nfavor of refined sugar stricken out of our tariff law. If with all the\r\nfavor now accorded the sugar-refining interest in our tariff laws it\r\nstill languishes to the extent of closed refineries and thousands of\r\ndischarged workmen, it would seem to present a hopeless case for\r\nreasonable legislative aid. Whatever else is done or omitted, I\r\nearnestly repeat here the recommendation I have made in another portion\r\nof this communication, that the additional duty of one-tenth of a cent\r\nper pound laid upon sugar imported from countries paying a bounty on its\r\nexport be abrogated. It seems to me that exceedingly important\r\nconsiderations point to the propriety of this amendment.\r\n\r\nWith the advent of a new tariff policy not only calculated to relieve\r\nthe consumers of our land in the cost of their daily life, but to invite\r\na better development of American thrift and create for us closer and\r\nmore profitable commercial relations with the rest of the world, it\r\nfollows as a logical and imperative necessity that we should at once\r\nremove the chief if not the only obstacle which has so long prevented\r\nour participation in the foreign carrying trade of the sea. A tariff\r\nbuilt upon the theory that it is well to check imports and that a home\r\nmarket should bound the industry and effort of American producers was\r\nfitly supplemented by a refusal to allow American registry to vessels\r\nbuilt abroad, though owned and navigated by our people, thus exhibiting\r\na willingness to abandon all contest for the advantages of American\r\ntransoceanic carriage. Our new tariff policy, built upon the theory that\r\nit is well to encourage such importations as our people need, and that\r\nour products and manufactures should find markets in every part of the\r\nhabitable globe, is consistently supplemented by the greatest possible\r\nliberty to our citizens in the ownership and navigation of ships in\r\nwhich our products and manufactures may be transported. The millions now\r\npaid to foreigners for carrying American passengers and products across\r\nthe sea should be turned into American hands. Shipbuilding, which has\r\nbeen protected to strangulation, should be revived by the prospect of\r\nprofitable employment for ships when built, and the American sailor\r\nshould be resurrected and again take his place--a sturdy and industrious\r\ncitizen in time of peace and a patriotic and safe defender of American\r\ninterests in the day of conflict.\r\n\r\nThe ancient provision of our law denying American registry to ships\r\nbuilt abroad and owned by Americans appears in the light of present\r\nconditions not only to be a failure for good at every point, but to\r\nbe nearer a relic of barbarism than anything that exists under the\r\npermission of a statute of the United States. I earnestly recommend\r\nits prompt repeal.\r\n\r\nDuring the last month the gold reserved in the Treasury for the purpose\r\nof redeeming the notes of the Government circulating as money in the\r\nhands of the people became so reduced and its further depletion in the\r\nnear future seemed so certain that in the exercise of proper care for\r\nthe public welfare it became necessary to replenish this reserve and\r\nthus maintain popular faith in the ability and determination of the\r\nGovernment to meet as agreed its pecuniary obligations.\r\n\r\nIt would have been well if in this emergency authority had existed to\r\nissue the bonds of the Government bearing a low rate of interest and\r\nmaturing within a short period; but the Congress having failed to confer\r\nsuch authority, resort was necessarily had to the resumption act of\r\n1875, and pursuant to its provisions bonds were issued drawing interest\r\nat the rate of 5 per cent per annum and maturing ten years after their\r\nissue, that being the shortest time authorized by the act. I am glad\r\nto say, however, that on the sale of these bonds the premium received\r\noperated to reduce the rate of interest to be paid by the Government\r\nto less than 3 per cent.\r\n\r\nNothing could be worse or further removed from sensible finance than the\r\nrelations existing between the currency the Government has issued, the\r\ngold held for its redemption, and the means which must be resorted to\r\nfor the purpose of replenishing such redemption fund when impaired. Even\r\nif the claims upon this fund were confined to the obligations originally\r\nintended and if the redemption of these obligations meant their\r\ncancellation, the fund would be very small. But these obligations when\r\nreceived and redeemed in gold are not canceled, but are reissued and may\r\ndo duty many times by way of drawing gold from the Treasury. Thus we\r\nhave an endless chain in operation constantly depleting the Treasury's\r\ngold and never near a final rest. As if this was not bad enough, we\r\nhave, by a statutory declaration that it is the policy of the Government\r\nto maintain the parity between gold and silver, aided the force and\r\nmomentum of this exhausting process and added largely to the currency\r\nobligations claiming this peculiar gold redemption. Our small gold\r\nreserve is thus subject to drain from every side. The demands that\r\nincrease our danger also increase the necessity of protecting this\r\nreserve against depletion, and it is most unsatisfactory to know that\r\nthe protection afforded is only a temporary palliation.\r\n\r\nIt is perfectly and palpably plain that the only way under present\r\nconditions by which this reserve when dangerously depleted can be\r\nreplenished is through the issue and sale of the bonds of the Government\r\nfor gold, and yet Congress has not only thus far declined to authorize\r\nthe issue of bonds best suited to such a purpose, but there seems a\r\ndisposition in some quarters to deny both the necessity and power for\r\nthe issue of bonds at all.\r\n\r\nI can not for a moment believe that any of our citizens are\r\ndeliberately willing that their Government should default in its\r\npecuniary obligations or that its financial operations should be reduced\r\nto a silver basis. At any rate, I should not feel that my duty was done\r\nif I omitted any effort I could make to avert such a calamity. As long,\r\ntherefore, as no provision is made for the final redemption or the\r\nputting aside of the currency obligation now used to repeatedly and\r\nconstantly draw from the Government its gold, and as long as no better\r\nauthority for bond issues is allowed than at present exists, such\r\nauthority will be utilized whenever and as often as it becomes necessary\r\nto maintain a sufficient gold reserve, and in abundant time to save the\r\ncredit of our country and make good the financial declarations of our\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nQuestions relating to our banks and currency are closely connected with\r\nthe subject just referred to, and they also present some unsatisfactory\r\nfeatures. Prominent among them are the lack of elasticity in our\r\ncurrency circulation and its frequent concentration in financial centers\r\nwhen it is most needed in other parts of the country.\r\n\r\nThe absolute divorcement of the Government from the business of banking\r\nis the ideal relationship of the Government to the circulation of the\r\ncurrency of the country.\r\n\r\nThis condition can not be immediately reached, but as a step in that\r\ndirection and as a means of securing a more elastic currency and\r\nobviating other objections to the present arrangement of bank\r\ncirculation the Secretary of the Treasury presents in his report a\r\nscheme modifying present banking laws and providing for the issue of\r\ncirculating notes by State banks free from taxation under certain\r\nlimitations.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary explains his plan so plainly and its advantages are\r\ndeveloped by him with such remarkable clearness that any effort on my\r\npart to present argument in its support would be superfluous. I shall\r\ntherefore content myself with an unqualified indorsement of the\r\nSecretary's proposed changes in the law and a brief and imperfect\r\nstatement of their prominent features.\r\n\r\nIt is proposed to repeal all laws providing for the deposit of United\r\nStates bonds as security for circulation; to permit national banks to\r\nissue circulating notes not exceeding in amount 75 per cent of their\r\npaid-up and unimpaired capital, provided they deposit with the\r\nGovernment as a guaranty fund, in United States legal-tender notes,\r\nincluding Treasury notes of 1890, a sum equal in amount to 30 per cent\r\nof the notes they desire to issue, this deposit to be maintained at\r\nall times, but whenever any bank retires any part of its circulation\r\na proportional part of its guaranty fund shall be returned to it;\r\nto permit the Secretary of the Treasury to prepare and keep on hand\r\nready for issue in case an increase in circulation is desired blank\r\nnational-bank notes for each bank having circulation and to repeal the\r\nprovisions of the present law imposing limitations and restrictions upon\r\nbanks desiring to reduce or increase their circulation, thus permitting\r\nsuch increase or reduction within the limit of 75 per cent of capital\r\nto be quickly made as emergencies arise.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the guaranty fund required, it is proposed to provide a\r\nsafety fund for the immediate redemption of the circulating notes of\r\nfailed banks by imposing a small annual tax, say one-half of 1 per cent,\r\nupon the average circulation of each bank until the fund amounts to 5\r\nper cent of the total circulation outstanding. When a bank fails its\r\nguaranty fund is to be paid into this safety fund and its notes are to\r\nbe redeemed in the first instance from such safety fund thus augmented,\r\nany impairment of such fund caused thereby to be made good from the\r\nimmediately available cash assets of said bank, and if these should\r\nbe insufficient such impairment to be made good by _pro rata_\r\nassessment among the other banks, their contributions constituting\r\na first lien upon the assets of the failed bank in favor of the\r\ncontributing banks. As a further security it is contemplated that the\r\nexisting provision fixing the individual liability of stockholders is to\r\nbe retained and the bank's indebtedness on account of its circulating\r\nnotes is to be made a first lien on all its assets.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of meeting the expense of printing notes, official\r\nsupervision, cancellation, and other like charges there shall be imposed\r\na tax of say one-half of 1 per cent per annum upon the average amount of\r\nnotes in circulation.\r\n\r\nIt is further provided that there shall be no national-bank notes issued\r\nof a less denomination than $10; that each national bank, except in case\r\nof a failed bank, shall redeem or retire its notes in the first instance\r\nat its own office or at agencies to be designated by it, and that no\r\nfixed reserve need be maintained on account of deposits.\r\n\r\nAnother very important feature of this plan is the exemption of State\r\nbanks from taxation by the United States in cases where it is shown to\r\nthe satisfaction of the Secretary of the Treasury and Comptroller of\r\nthe Currency by banks claiming such exemption that they have not had\r\noutstanding their circulating notes exceeding 75 per cent of their\r\npaid-up and unimpaired capital; that their stockholders are individually\r\nliable for the redemption of their circulating notes to the full extent\r\nof their ownership of stock; that the liability of said banks upon their\r\ncirculating notes constitutes under their State law a first lien upon\r\ntheir assets; that such banks have kept and maintained a guaranty fund\r\nin United States legal-tender notes, including Treasury notes of 1890,\r\nequal to 30 per cent of their outstanding circulating notes, and that\r\nsuch banks have promptly redeemed their circulating notes when presented\r\nat their principal or branch offices.\r\n\r\nIt is quite likely that this scheme may be usefully amended in some of\r\nits details, but I am satisfied it furnishes a basis for a very great\r\nimprovement in our present banking and currency system.\r\n\r\nI conclude this communication fully appreciating that the responsibility\r\nfor all legislation affecting the people of the United States rests upon\r\ntheir representatives in the Congress, and assuring them that, whether\r\nin accordance with recommendations I have made or not, I shall be glad\r\nto cooperate in perfecting any legislation that tends to the prosperity\r\nand welfare of our country.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: See pp. 440-441.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: See p. 439.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: See p. 477.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: See Vol. VIII, pp. 517-518.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _December 6, 1894_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate of the 24th of July,\r\n1894, directing the Secretary of State to furnish copies of all papers,\r\ncorrespondence, diplomatic or otherwise, on file in the State Department\r\nin connection with the arrest and imprisonment at Arequipa, Peru, of\r\nVictor H.

The killing was in a conflict between\r\n  armed Armenians and Turkish soldiers. The grand vizier says it was\r\n  necessary to suppress insurrection, and that about fifty Turks were\r\n  killed; between three and four hundred Armenian guns were picked up\r\n  after the fight, and reports that about that number of Armenians were\r\n  killed. I give credit to his statement.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe other dispatch referred to is dated December 2, 1894, and is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  Information from British ambassador indicates far more loss of lives in\r\n  Armenia, attended with atrocities, than stated in my telegram of 28th.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have received absolutely no information concerning any cruelties\r\ncommitted \"upon citizens who have declared their intention to become\r\nnaturalized in this country,\" or upon any persons who had a right to\r\nclaim or have claimed for any reason the protection of the United States\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of such authentic detailed knowledge on the subject as\r\nwould justify our interference no \"expostulations have been addressed by\r\nthis Government to the Government of Turkey in regard to such matters.\"\r\n\r\nThe last inquiry contained in the resolution of the Senate touching\r\nthese alleged cruelties seeks information concerning \"any proposals made\r\nby or to this Government to act in concert with other Christian powers\r\nregarding the same.\"\r\n\r\nThe first proposal of the kind referred to was made by the Turkish\r\nGovernment through our minister on the 30th day of November, when the\r\nSultan then expressed a desire that a consul of the United States be\r\nsent with a Turkish commission to investigate these alleged atrocities\r\non Armenians. This was construed as an invitation on the part of the\r\nTurkish Government to actually take part with a Turkish commission in an\r\ninvestigation of these affairs and any report to be made thereon, and\r\nthe proposition came before our minister's second dispatch was received\r\nand at a time when the best information in the possession of our\r\nGovernment was derived from his first report, indicating that the\r\nstatements made in the press were sensational and exaggerated and that\r\nthe atrocities alleged really did not exist. This condition very much\r\nweakened any motive for an interference based on considerations of\r\nhumanity, and permitted us without embarrassment to pursue a course\r\nplainly marked out by other controlling incidents.\r\n\r\nBy a treaty entered into at Berlin in the year 1878 between Turkey and\r\nvarious other governments Turkey undertook to guarantee protection to\r\nthe Armenians, and agreed that it would \"periodically make known the\r\nsteps taken to this effect to the powers, who will superintend their\r\napplication.\"\r\n\r\nOur Government was not a party to this treaty, and it is entirely\r\nobvious that in the face of the provisions of such treaty above recited\r\nour interference in the proposed investigation, especially without the\r\ninvitation of any of the powers which had assumed by treaty obligations\r\nto secure the protection of these Armenians, might have been exceedingly\r\nembarrassing, if not entirely beyond the limits of justification or\r\npropriety.\r\n\r\nThe Turkish invitation to join the investigation set on foot by that\r\nGovernment was therefore, on the 2d day of December, declined. On the\r\nsame day, and after this declination had been sent, our minister at\r\nConstantinople forwarded his second dispatch, tending to modify his\r\nformer report as to the extent and character of Armenian slaughter.\r\nAt the same time the request of the Sultan for our participation in the\r\ninvestigation was repeated, and Great Britain, one of the powers which\r\njoined in the treaty of Berlin, made a like request.\r\n\r\nIn view of changed conditions and upon reconsideration of the subject\r\nit was determined to send Mr. Jewett, our consul at Sivas, to the scene\r\nof the alleged outrages, not for the purpose of joining with any other\r\ngovernment in an investigation and report, but to the end that he might\r\nbe able to inform this Government as to the exact truth.\r\n\r\nInstructions to this effect were sent to Mr. Jewett, and it is supposed\r\nhe has already entered upon the duty assigned him.\r\n\r\nI submit with this communication copies of all correspondence and\r\ndispatches in the State Department on this subject and the report to me\r\nof the Secretary of State thereon.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, January 3, 1895_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn response to the resolution of the Senate of the 4th ultimo,\r\nrequesting \"any reports or correspondence relating to affairs at\r\nBluefields, in the Mosquito territory,\" and also information as to\r\n\"whether any American citizens have been arrested or the rights of any\r\nAmerican citizens at Bluefields have been interfered with during the\r\npast two years by the Government of Nicaragua,\" I transmit herewith a\r\nreport from the Secretary of State, with accompanying papers.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 9, 1895_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\n\r\nI submit herewith certain dispatches from our minister at Hawaii and the\r\ndocuments which accompanied the same.\r\n\r\nThey disclose the fact that the Hawaiian Government desires to lease\r\nto Great Britain one of the uninhabited islands belonging to Hawaii as\r\na station for a submarine telegraph cable to be laid from Canada to\r\nAustralia, with a connection between the island leased and Honolulu.\r\n\r\nBoth the Hawaiian Government and the representatives of Great Britain\r\nin this negotiation concede that the proposed lease can not be effected\r\nwithout the consent of the United States, for the reason that in our\r\nreciprocity treaty with the King of Hawaii he agreed that as long as\r\nsaid treaty remained in force he would not \"lease or otherwise dispose\r\nof or create any lien upon any port, harbor, or other territory in his\r\ndominion, or grant any special privilege or right of use therein, to any\r\nother power, state, or government.\"\r\n\r\nAt the request of the Hawaiian Government this subject is laid before\r\nthe Congress for its determination upon the question of so modifying the\r\ntreaty agreement above recited as to permit the proposed lease.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the correspondence which is submitted between the\r\nHawaiian and British negotiators negatives the existence on the part of\r\nHawaii of any suspicion of British unfriendliness or the fear of British\r\naggression.\r\n\r\nThe attention of the Congress is directed to the following statement\r\ncontained in a communication addressed to the Hawaiian Government by the\r\nrepresentatives of Great Britain:\r\n\r\n  We propose to inform the British Government of your inquiry whether\r\n  they would accept the sovereignty of Nicker Island or some other\r\n  uninhabited island on condition that no subsidy is required from you.\r\n  As we explained, we have not felt at liberty to entertain that question\r\n  ourselves, as we were definitely instructed not to ask for the\r\n  sovereignty of any island, but only for a lease simply for the purpose\r\n  of the cable.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of the dispatches from our minister, which are submitted, not\r\nonly refer to the project for leasing an uninhabited island belonging\r\nto Hawaii, but contain interesting information concerning recent\r\noccurrences in that country and its political and social condition.\r\nThis information is valuable because it is based upon the observation\r\nand knowledge necessarily within the scope of the diplomatic duties\r\nwhich are intrusted solely to the charge of this intelligent diplomatic\r\nofficer representing the United States Government at Hawaii.\r\n\r\nI hope the Congress will see fit to grant the request of the Hawaiian\r\nGovernment, and that our consent to the proposed lease will be promptly\r\naccorded. It seems to me we ought not by a refusal of this request to\r\nstand in the way of the advantages to be gained by isolated Hawaii\r\nthrough telegraphic communication with the rest of the world, especially\r\nin view of the fact that our own communication with that country would\r\nthereby be greatly improved without apparent detriment to any legitimate\r\nAmerican interest.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 11, 1895_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn response to the resolution of the Senate of the 19th ultimo,\r\nrequesting the record of the extradition proceedings in the case of\r\nGeneral Ezeta, etc., I transmit herewith a letter from the Secretary of\r\nState, with accompanying papers.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, January 15, 1895_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit a report from the Secretary of State, with accompanying\r\npapers, in response to the resolution of the Senate of the 3d instant,\r\nrequesting \"all correspondence or other papers relating to the delivery\r\nby the United States consul at Shanghai of two Japanese citizens to\r\nthe Chinese authorities,\" and information \"whether the said Japanese\r\nwere put to death after being tortured, and whether there was any\r\nunderstanding with the Chinese Government that officers of the United\r\nStates should aid, assist, and give comfort to any Japanese citizen\r\ndesiring to leave China, and whether the United States consul at Hankow\r\nwas reprimanded by Chinese officials for aiding Japanese citizens to\r\nleave the country, and whether all information was refused to the United\r\nStates consul at Ningpo when he made inquiries as to the charges against\r\ncertain Japanese citizens arrested there.\"\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 28, 1895_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message I commended to the serious consideration of\r\nthe Congress the condition of our national finances, and in connection\r\nwith the subject indorsed a plan of currency legislation which at that\r\ntime seemed to furnish protection against impending danger.[14] This plan\r\nhas not been approved by the Congress. In the meantime the situation has\r\nso changed and the emergency now appears so threatening that I deem it\r\nmy duty to ask at the hands of the legislative branch of the Government\r\nsuch prompt and effective action as will restore confidence in our\r\nfinancial soundness and avert business disaster and universal distress\r\namong our people.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the merits of the plan outlined in my annual message as\r\na remedy for ills then existing and as a safeguard against the depletion\r\nof the gold reserve then in the Treasury, I am now convinced that its\r\nreception by the Congress and our present advanced stage of financial\r\nperplexity necessitate additional or different legislation.\r\n\r\nWith natural resources unlimited in variety and productive strength and\r\nwith a people whose activity and enterprise seek only a fair opportunity\r\nto achieve national success and greatness, our progress should not be\r\nchecked by a false financial policy and a heedless disregard of sound\r\nmonetary laws, nor should the timidity and fear which they engender\r\nstand in the way of our prosperity.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly disputed that this predicament confronts us to-day.\r\nTherefore no one in any degree responsible for the making and execution\r\nof our laws should fail to see a patriotic duty in honestly and\r\nsincerely attempting to relieve the situation. Manifestly this effort\r\nwill not succeed unless it is made untrammeled by the prejudice of\r\npartisanship and with a steadfast determination to resist the temptation\r\nto accomplish party advantage. We may well remember that if we are\r\nthreatened with financial difficulties all our people in every station\r\nof life are concerned; and surely those who suffer will not receive the\r\npromotion of party interests as an excuse for permitting our present\r\ntroubles to advance to a disastrous conclusion. It is also of the utmost\r\nimportance that we approach the study of the problems presented as free\r\nas possible from the tyranny of preconceived opinions, to the end that\r\nin a common danger we may be able to seek with unclouded vision a safe\r\nand reasonable protection.\r\n\r\nThe real trouble which confronts us consists in a lack of confidence,\r\nwidespread and constantly increasing, in the continuing ability or\r\ndisposition of the Government to pay its obligations in gold. This lack\r\nof confidence grows to some extent out of the palpable and apparent\r\nembarrassment attending the efforts of the Government under existing\r\nlaws to procure gold and to a greater extent out of the impossibility\r\nof either keeping it in the Treasury or canceling obligations by its\r\nexpenditure after it is obtained.\r\n\r\nThe only way left open to the Government for procuring gold is by the\r\nissue and sale of its bonds. The only bonds that can be so issued were\r\nauthorized nearly twenty-five years ago and are not well calculated to\r\nmeet our present needs. Among other disadvantages, they are made payable\r\nin coin instead of specifically in gold, which in existing conditions\r\ndetracts largely and in an increasing ratio from their desirability as\r\ninvestments. It is by no means certain that bonds of this description\r\ncan much longer be disposed of at a price creditable to the financial\r\ncharacter of our Government.\r\n\r\nThe most dangerous and irritating feature of the situation, however,\r\nremains to be mentioned. It is found in the means by which the Treasury\r\nis despoiled of the gold thus obtained without canceling a single\r\nGovernment obligation and solely for the benefit of those who find\r\nprofit in shipping it abroad or whose fears induce them to hoard it at\r\nhome. We have outstanding about five hundred millions of currency notes\r\nof the Government for which gold may be demanded, and, curiously enough,\r\nthe law requires that when presented and, in fact, redeemed and paid in\r\ngold they shall be reissued. Thus the same notes may do duty many times\r\nin drawing gold from the Treasury; nor can the process be arrested as\r\nlong as private parties, for profit or otherwise, see an advantage in\r\nrepeating the operation. More than $300,000,000 in these notes have\r\nalready been redeemed in gold, and notwithstanding such redemption they\r\nare all still outstanding.\r\n\r\nSince the 17th day of January, 1894, our bonded interest-bearing debt\r\nhas been increased $100,000,000 for the purpose of obtaining gold to\r\nreplenish our coin reserve. Two issues were made amounting to fifty\r\nmillions each, one in January and the other in November. As a result of\r\nthe first issue there was realized something more than $58,000,000 in\r\ngold. Between that issue and the succeeding one in November, comprising\r\na period of about ten months, nearly $103,000,000 in gold were drawn\r\nfrom the Treasury. This made the second issue necessary, and upon that\r\nmore than fifty-eight millions in gold was again realized. Between the\r\ndate of this second issue and the present time, covering a period of\r\nonly about two months, more than $69,000,000 in gold have been drawn\r\nfrom the Treasury. These large sums of gold were expended without any\r\ncancellation of Government obligations or in any permanent way\r\nbenefiting our people or improving our pecuniary situation.\r\n\r\nThe financial events of the past year suggest facts and conditions which\r\nshould certainly arrest attention.\r\n\r\nMore than $172,000,000 in gold have been drawn out of the Treasury\r\nduring the year for the purpose of shipment abroad or hoarding at home.\r\n\r\nWhile nearly $103,000,000 of this amount was drawn out during the first\r\nten months of the year, a sum aggregating more than two-thirds of that\r\namount, being about $69,000,000, was drawn out during the following two\r\nmonths, thus indicating a marked acceleration of the depleting process\r\nwith the lapse of time.\r\n\r\nThe obligations upon which this gold has been drawn from the Treasury\r\nare still outstanding and are available for use in repeating the\r\nexhausting operation with shorter intervals as our perplexities\r\naccumulate.\r\n\r\nConditions are certainly supervening tending to make the bonds which may\r\nbe issued to replenish our gold less useful for that purpose.\r\n\r\nAn adequate gold reserve is in all circumstances absolutely essential to\r\nthe upholding of our public credit and to the maintenance of our high\r\nnational character.\r\n\r\nOur gold reserve has again reached such a stage of diminution as to\r\nrequire its speedy reenforcement.\r\n\r\nThe aggravations that must inevitably follow present conditions and\r\nmethods will certainly lead to misfortune and loss, not only to our\r\nnational credit and prosperity and to financial enterprise, but to those\r\nof our people who seek employment as a means of livelihood and to those\r\nwhose only capital is their daily labor.\r\n\r\nIt will hardly do to say that a simple increase of revenue will cure our\r\ntroubles. The apprehension now existing and constantly increasing as to\r\nour financial ability does not rest upon a calculation of our revenue.\r\nThe time has passed when the eyes of investors abroad and our people at\r\nhome were fixed upon the revenues of the Government. Changed conditions\r\nhave attracted their attention to the gold of the Government. There need\r\nbe no fear that we can not pay our current expenses with such money as\r\nwe have. There is now in the Treasury a comfortable surplus of more than\r\n$63,000,000, but it is not in gold, and therefore does not meet our\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nI can not see that differences of opinion concerning the extent to which\r\nsilver ought to be coined or used in our currency should interfere with\r\nthe counsels of those whose duty it is to rectify evils now apparent in\r\nour financial situation. They have to consider the question of national\r\ncredit and the consequences that will follow from its collapse. Whatever\r\nideas may be insisted upon as to silver or bimetallism, a proper\r\nsolution of the question now pressing upon us only requires a\r\nrecognition of gold as well as silver and a concession of its\r\nimportance, rightfully or wrongfully acquired, as a basis of national\r\ncredit, a necessity in the honorable discharge of our obligations\r\npayable in gold, and a badge of solvency. I do not understand that the\r\nreal friends of silver desire a condition that might follow inaction or\r\nneglect to appreciate the meaning of the present exigency if it should\r\nresult in the entire banishment of gold from our financial and currency\r\narrangements.\r\n\r\nBesides the Treasury notes, which certainly should be paid in gold,\r\namounting to nearly $500,000,000, there will fall due in 1904 one\r\nhundred millions of bonds issued during the last year, for which we have\r\nreceived gold, and in 1907 nearly six hundred millions of 4 per cent\r\nbonds issued in 1877. Shall the payment of these obligations in gold be\r\nrepudiated? If they are to be paid in such a manner as the preservation\r\nof our national honor and national solvency demands, we should not\r\ndestroy or even imperil our ability to supply ourselves with gold for\r\nthat purpose.\r\n\r\nWhile I am not unfriendly to silver and while I desire to see it\r\nrecognized to such an extent as is consistent with financial safety and\r\nthe preservation of national honor and credit, I am not willing to see\r\ngold entirely banished from our currency and finances. To avert such a\r\nconsequence I believe thorough and radical remedial legislation should\r\nbe promptly passed. I therefore beg the Congress to give the subject\r\nimmediate attention.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion the Secretary of the Treasury should be authorized\r\nto issue bonds of the Government for the purpose of procuring\r\nand maintaining a sufficient gold reserve and the redemption and\r\ncancellation of the United States legal-tender notes and the Treasury\r\nnotes issued for the purchase of silver under the law of July 14, 1890.\r\nWe should be relieved from the humiliating process of issuing bonds\r\nto procure gold to be immediately and repeatedly drawn out on these\r\nobligations for purposes not related to the benefit of our Government or\r\nour people. The principal and interest of these bonds should be payable\r\non their face in gold, because they should be sold only for gold or its\r\nrepresentative, and because there would now probably be difficulty in\r\nfavorably disposing of bonds not containing this stipulation. I suggest\r\nthat the bonds be issued in denominations of twenty and fifty dollars\r\nand their multiples and that they bear interest at a rate not exceeding\r\n3 per cent per annum. I do not see why they should not be payable fifty\r\nyears from their date. We of the present generation have large amounts\r\nto pay if we meet our obligations, and long bonds are most salable. The\r\nSecretary of the Treasury might well be permitted at his discretion to\r\nreceive on the sale of bonds the legal-tender and Treasury notes to be\r\nretired, and of course when they are thus retired or redeemed in gold\r\nthey should be canceled.\r\n\r\nThese bonds under existing laws could be deposited by national\r\nbanks as security for circulation, and such banks should be allowed to\r\nissue circulation up to the face value of these or any other bonds so\r\ndeposited, except bonds outstanding bearing only 2 per cent interest and\r\nwhich sell in the market at less than par. National banks should not be\r\nallowed to take out circulating notes of a less denomination than $10,\r\nand when such as are now outstanding reach the Treasury, except for\r\nredemption and retirement, they should be canceled and notes of the\r\ndenomination of $10 and upward issued in their stead. Silver certificates\r\nof the denomination of $10 and upward should be replaced by certificates\r\nof the denominations under $10.\r\n\r\nAs a constant means for the maintenance of a reasonable supply of gold\r\nin the Treasury, our duties on imports should be paid in gold, allowing\r\nall other dues to the Government to be paid in any other form of money.\r\n\r\nI believe all the provisions I have suggested should be embodied in our\r\nlaws if we are to enjoy a complete reinstatement of a sound financial\r\ncondition. They need not interfere with any currency scheme providing\r\nfor the increase of the circulating medium through the agency of\r\nnational or State banks that may commend itself to the Congress, since\r\nthey can easily be adjusted to such a scheme. Objection has been made to\r\nthe issuance of interest-bearing obligations for the purpose of retiring\r\nthe noninterest-bearing legal-tender notes. In point of fact, however,\r\nthese notes have burdened us with a large load of interest, and it is\r\nstill accumulating. The aggregate interest on the original issue of\r\nbonds, the proceeds of which in gold constituted the reserve for the\r\npayment of these notes, amounted to $70,326,250 on January 1, 1895, and\r\nthe annual charge for interest on these bonds and those issued for the\r\nsame purpose during the last year will be $9,145,000, dating from\r\nJanuary 1, 1895.\r\n\r\nWhile the cancellation of these notes would not relieve us from the\r\nobligations already incurred on their account, these figures are given\r\nby way of suggesting that their existence has not been free from\r\ninterest charges and that the longer they are outstanding, judging from\r\nthe experience of the last year, the more expensive they will become.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I desire to frankly confess my reluctance to issuing more\r\nbonds in present circumstances and with no better results than have\r\nlately followed that course. I can not, however, refrain from adding to\r\nan assurance of my anxiety to cooperate with the present Congress in any\r\nreasonable measure of relief an expression of my determination to leave\r\nnothing undone which furnishes a hope for improving the situation or\r\nchecking a suspicion of our disinclination or disability to meet with\r\nthe strictest honor every national obligation.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: See pp. 553-556.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 30, 1895_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n28th instant, the Senate concurring, I herewith return the bill (H.R.\r\n6186) entitled \"An act to pension Maria Davis.\"\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, February 4, 1895_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn response to the resolution of the Senate dated December 6, 1894,\r\nrequesting that copies of correspondence in regard to the claim of\r\nAntonio Maximo Mora against the Government of Spain exchanged since my\r\nlast message to the Senate on the same subject, dated June 20, 1894,[15]\r\nbe communicated to it if not incompatible with the public interests, I\r\ntransmit herewith a report of the Secretary of State, inclosing copies\r\nof further correspondence exchanged between the Governments of the\r\nUnited States and Spain since the date of my last message to the Senate,\r\nDecember 11, 1894.[16]\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: See p. 476.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: See p. 557.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, February 4, 1895_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn response to the resolution of the House of Representatives of\r\nthe 1st instant, calling for certain information touching the recent\r\ninsurrection in the Hawaiian Islands, I transmit herewith a report of\r\nthe Secretary of State, with accompanying papers.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 7, 1895_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n2d instant, the Senate concurring, I return herewith the bill (H.R.\r\n5377) entitled \"An act granting a pension to Richard R.

Such a\r\npremium is to be allowed to the Government upon the bonds as to fix the\r\nrate of interest upon the amount of gold realized at 3-3/4 per cent per\r\nannum. At least one-half of the gold to be obtained is to be supplied\r\nfrom abroad, which is a very important and favorable feature of the\r\ntransaction.\r\n\r\nThe privilege is especially reserved to the Government to substitute\r\nat par within ten days from this date, in lieu of the 4 per cent coin\r\nbonds, other bonds in terms payable in gold and bearing only 3 per cent\r\ninterest if the issue of the same should in the meantime be authorized\r\nby the Congress.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement thus completed, which after careful inquiry appears in\r\npresent circumstances and considering all the objects desired to be\r\nthe best attainable, develops such a difference in the estimation of\r\ninvestors between bonds made payable in coin and those specifically\r\nmade payable in gold in favor of the latter as is represented by\r\nthree-fourths of a cent in annual interest. In the agreement just\r\nconcluded the annual saving in interest to the Government if 3 per cent\r\ngold bonds should be substituted for 4 per cent coin bonds under the\r\nprivilege reserved would be $539,159 amounting in thirty years, or at\r\nthe maturity of the coin bonds, to $16,174,770.\r\n\r\nOf course there never should be a doubt in any quarter as to the\r\nredemption in gold of the bonds of the Government which are made payable\r\nin coin. Therefore the discrimination, in the judgment of investors,\r\nbetween our bond obligations payable in coin and those specifically made\r\npayable in gold is very significant. It is hardly necessary to suggest\r\nthat, whatever may be our views on the subject, the sentiments or\r\npreferences of those with whom we must negotiate in disposing of our\r\nbonds for gold are not subject to our dictation.\r\n\r\nI have only to add that in my opinion the transaction herein detailed\r\nfor the information of the Congress promises better results than the\r\nefforts previously made in the direction of effectively adding to our\r\ngold reserve through the sale of bonds, and I believe it will tend,\r\nas far as such action can in present circumstances, to meet the\r\ndetermination expressed in the law repealing the silver-purchasing\r\nclause of the act of July 14, 1890, and that, in the language of such\r\nrepealing act, the arrangement made will aid our efforts to \"insure the\r\nmaintenance of the parity in value of the coins of the two metals and\r\nthe equal power of every dollar at all times in the markets and in the\r\npayment of debts.\"\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: See pp. 561-565.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 8, 1895_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for the information of the Congress, a copy of\r\na telegraphic dispatch just received from Mr. Willis, our minister to\r\nHawaii, with a copy of the reply thereto which was immediately sent by\r\nthe Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 11, 1895_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_::\r\n\r\nOn the 8th day of January I received a copy of the following Senate\r\nresolution:\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That the President be requested, if not incompatible\r\n  with the public interests, to communicate to the Senate all reports,\r\n  documents, and other papers, including logs of vessels, relating to the\r\n  enforcement of the regulations respecting fur seals adopted by the\r\n  Governments of the United States and Great Britain in accordance with\r\n  the decision of the Tribunal of Arbitration convened at Paris and the\r\n  resolutions under which said reports are required to be made, as well\r\n  as relating to the number of seals taken during the season of 1894\r\n  by pelagic hunters and by the lessees of the Pribilof and Commander\r\n  islands; also relating to the steps which may have been taken to extend\r\n  the said regulations to the Asiatic waters of the North Pacific Ocean\r\n  and Bering Sea and to secure the concurrence of other nations in\r\n  said regulations, and, further, all papers not heretofore published,\r\n  including communications of the agent of the United States before said\r\n  tribunal at Paris, relating to the claims of the British Government on\r\n  account of the seizure of the sealing vessels in Bering Sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn compliance with said request I herewith transmit sundry papers,\r\ndocuments, and reports which have been returned to me by the Secretary\r\nof State, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Secretary of the Navy,\r\nto whom said resolution was referred.

It\r\nalso permits grants of the right of way for pipe lines connecting such\r\nreservoirs with the railways of said companies.\r\n\r\nThe second, third, and fourth sections of the bill relate to the\r\npurchase by any citizen of the United States, or any association of\r\ncitizens, or any ditch or water company, of public lands suitable for\r\nreservoir purposes at such a price as the Secretary of the Interior\r\nshall prescribe, not less than $2 per acre.\r\n\r\nThe right to purchase these lands is given by the sections last referred\r\nto \"under rules and regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the\r\nInterior.\"\r\n\r\nI think the expediency and propriety of disposing of these lands for the\r\npurposes specified should in each case be determined by the Secretary of\r\nthe Interior, as well as the rules and regulations governing such\r\ndisposition.\r\n\r\nThe objections to the bill, however, which appear to be the most serious\r\nare found in its fifth and last section, which provides:\r\n\r\n  That any State or any county or district organization duly organized\r\n  under the laws of any State or Territory may apply for any of the\r\n  storage-reservoir sites not reserved by the United States, situated on\r\n  unentered public lands, for the storage of water for irrigating, mining,\r\n  or other useful purposes, whereupon the Secretary of the Interior shall\r\n  set aside and withdraw from public sale or other disposition such site\r\n  or sites and permit the use thereof for either or all of such purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese provisions do not seem to be in harmony with prior laws by which,\r\nunder certain conditions, arid lands may be conveyed to States for the\r\npurpose of irrigation, and it is not clear what is intended by the words\r\n\"any of the storage-reservoir sites not reserved by the United States.\"\r\n\r\nThe apparent purpose and effect of the section is to give to the\r\norganizations mentioned the right to select such land as may present\r\neligible reservoir sites not reserved and upon unentered lands, and\r\ndemand of the Secretary of the Interior a grant of the same, leaving\r\nno discretion on the subject to him or to any other officer of the\r\nGovernment; and these grants are to be made without any compensation\r\nto the Government and without any specific requirement of the amount\r\nor kind of work to be done or improvements to be made upon such sites.\r\n\r\nThe grants may be demanded not only for the storage of water for\r\nirrigating purposes, but for \"mining and other useful purposes.\"\r\nInasmuch as no officer of the Government is vested with any discretion\r\nin the premises, the pretext that the \"purpose\" to be accomplished is\r\n\"useful\" might result in the use of these sites in a manner prejudicial\r\nto the surrounding public domain and destructive of the utilization of\r\nsuch sites for irrigating purposes.\r\n\r\nThe wise and prudent safeguards which have been incorporated in\r\nother legislation relating to the disposition of arid public lands and\r\ntheir irrigation seem to have been to such an extent overlooked in the\r\nconstruction of the bill under consideration that, in my judgment, if\r\nit should become the law a beneficent policy which the Government has\r\nentered upon in the interest of agriculture would be seriously\r\nendangered.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 1, 1895_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return without my approval Senate bill No. 2338, entitled\r\n\"An act granting to the Gila Valley, Globe and Northern Railway Company a\r\nright of way through the San Carlos Indian Reservation, in the Territory\r\nof Arizona.\"\r\n\r\nThe reservation through which it is proposed to construct a railroad\r\nunder the provisions of this bill is inhabited by tribes of Indians\r\nwhich in the past have been most troublesome and whose depredations\r\non more than one occasion have caused loss of life, destruction of\r\nproperty, and serious alarm to the people of the surrounding country;\r\nand their condition as to civilization is not now so far improved as\r\nto give assurance that in the future they may not upon occasion make\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\nThe discontent among the Indians which has given rise to disturbances\r\nin the past has been largely caused by trespass upon their lands and\r\ninterference with their rights by the neighboring whites. I am in\r\nvery great doubt whether in any circumstances a road through their\r\nreservation should at this time be permitted, and especially since the\r\nroute, which is rather indefinitely described in the bill, appears to\r\npass through the richest and most desirable part of their lands. In\r\nany event, I am thoroughly convinced that the construction of the road\r\nshould not be permitted without first obtaining the consent of these\r\nIndians. This is a provision which has been insisted upon, so far as\r\nI am aware, in all the like bills which have been approved for a long\r\ntime, and I think it should especially be inserted in this bill if, even\r\nupon any conditions, it is thought expedient to permit a railroad to\r\ntraverse this reservation.\r\n\r\nThe importance of this consent does not rest solely upon the extent to\r\nwhich the Indians have the right of ownership over this land. The fact\r\nthat the procurement of this consent is the most effective means of\r\nallaying the discontent which might arise and perhaps develop into a\r\ntrain of lamentable and destructive outbreaks of violence particularly\r\nemphasizes its importance.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 5, 1895_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return herewith without approval House bill No. 5368, entitled \"An act\r\nfor the relief of H.W. McConnell.\"\r\n\r\nThe reports of both the Senate and House committees, which favorably\r\nreported this bill, disclose an intention to partially relieve the\r\nformer postmaster at Jacksboro, in the State of Texas, from liability\r\non account of two remittances of postal funds which he dispatched at\r\ndifferent times during the year 1883 to be deposited at Dallas, in the\r\nsame State, and which were lost by robberies of the stage conveying\r\nthe same. In dealing with the first remittance the committees report\r\nthat the postmaster should be relieved of liability to the amount of\r\nonly $94, the loss of the remainder of the money being chargeable to\r\nhis neglect and violation of postal regulations. As to the second\r\nremittance, the committees report that by reason of like neglect and\r\nviolation of regulations the postmaster should be held responsible\r\nfor the loss of all the money transmitted except the sum of $42.\r\n\r\nFor these two sums, amounting to $136, an appropriation is made for the\r\nbenefit of H.W. McConnell.\r\n\r\nThe name of the postmaster intended to be relieved is H.H. McConnell, as\r\nappears by the records of the Post-Office Department. The person to whom\r\nthe money appropriated should be paid is therefore not correctly named\r\nin the bill.\r\n\r\nAn examination of this postmaster's accounts discloses the further fact\r\nthat the amount proposed to be appropriated for his relief is too large\r\nby $42, that being the sum allowed him by reason of the second stage\r\nrobbery. This item has already been credited to him in the adjustment\r\nof his accounts at the Post-Office Department, and the claim for its\r\nreimbursement has been thereby extinguished.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 12, 1895_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI return herewith without approval Senate bill No. 143, entitled \"An act\r\nfor the relief of the heirs of D. Fulford.\"\r\n\r\nThis bill directs the Secretary of the Treasury \"to redeem, in favor of\r\nthe heirs at law of D. Fulford, four bonds of the United States, consols\r\nof 1867, of the denomination of $500, $100, $50, and $50, and known as\r\nfive-twenties, said bonds having been destroyed by fire the 9th day of\r\nJuly, 1872, and to pay to the heirs at law of said D. Fulford the amount\r\nof said bonds, together with accrued interest from July 1, 1872, to the\r\ndate of the maturity of said bonds.\"\r\n\r\nThe bill further provides that the heirs to whom the payment is to be\r\nmade shall execute and file with the Secretary of the Treasury a bond\r\n\"conditioned to save harmless the United States from loss or liability\r\non account of said bonds or the interest accrued thereon, and to contain\r\nsuch words as to cover any liability resulting from any mistake in the\r\ndesignation or description of the bonds, so that in no event shall the\r\nUnited States be called upon by a rightful claimant for a second payment\r\nthereof.\"\r\n\r\nThe proposition is that the Government shall pay bonds alleged to have\r\nbeen destroyed by fire nearly twenty-three years ago.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Treasury states that an application for the\r\npayment of these bonds, made by Mr. Fulford himself, was rejected by\r\nthe Department because he was unable to describe the bonds in such a\r\nway as to permit their identification and because the evidence of their\r\ndestruction by fire was inconclusive.\r\n\r\nThe Senate Committee on Claims, however, in their report on the bill\r\nunder consideration, state that they are entirely satisfied that Mr.\r\nFulford was the owner of four Government bonds, one for $500, one for\r\n$100, and two for $50, and that they were burned with his residence,\r\nwhich was destroyed by fire on the 9th day of July, 1872, and that\r\nwhile he could not furnish the numbers or descriptions of said bonds\r\nhe understood all these bonds were of the class known as consols of\r\n1867, and that he had collected the coupons thereon for the interest\r\ndue July 1, 1872.\r\n\r\nThe particular class of bonds mentioned were dated July 1, 1867, and\r\nwere payable or redeemable not less than five nor more than twenty years\r\nfrom their date. The short period expired, therefore, on the 1st day of\r\nJuly, 1872. That was the date when the last coupons on Mr. Fulford's\r\nbonds, which it is alleged were detached and collected, became due, and\r\nonly nine days before the supposed destruction of the bonds by fire.\r\n\r\nA letter from the Secretary of the Treasury dated July 20, 1892,\r\nattached to the report of the Senate committee made upon a bill similar\r\nto this which was pending at that time, discloses the fact that among\r\nthe consols of 1867 then outstanding there were 107 of the denomination\r\nof $500, 167 of the denomination of $100, and 85 of the denomination\r\nof $50. This statement merely shows that there were numerous bonds\r\nprecisely similar to those described as belonging to Mr. Fulford which\r\nhad not in July, 1892, been redeemed, though the extreme limit of\r\ntheir maturity expired on the 1st day of July, 1887. The letter of\r\nthe Secretary further discloses, however, that there were two of\r\nthese outstanding bonds of the denomination of $500 and two of the\r\ndenomination of $100 upon which coupons of interest had not been paid\r\nsince July 1, 1872. Of course this lends plausibility to the suggestion\r\nthat two of these four bonds, one of each denomination, were those\r\ndestroyed when Mr. Fulford's house was burned in July, 1872; but this\r\nsuggestion loses its force under the additional statement in the letter\r\nof the Secretary of the Treasury that in July, 1892, there were no\r\nconsols of 1867 of the denomination of $50 whose last coupon was paid\r\nJuly 1, 1872. This shows conclusively that no fifty-dollar bonds of this\r\nclass were destroyed by fire in Mr. Fulford's house and casts great\r\nuncertainty upon the description of the other bonds, inasmuch as the\r\ntheory of the claimants seems to be that all the bonds destroyed\r\nbelonged to the same class.\r\n\r\nIn 1893, upon an examination of the records of the Treasury Department,\r\nit was found that the two unpaid bonds for $500 reported in 1892 as\r\noutstanding, from which no coupons had been paid since July 1, 1872,\r\nstill remained unredeemed, but that one of the two one-hundred-dollar\r\nbonds which were in that condition in 1892 had been since that time paid\r\nand canceled. I think it must be conceded that this late redemption of\r\nthis bond greatly weakens any presumption that the other three will not\r\nbe presented for payment.\r\n\r\nIt is perfectly clear that so far as this bill directs the payment to\r\nthe persons therein named of two consols of 1867 of the denomination of\r\n$50 each on the ground that such bonds were destroyed by fire in July,\r\n1872, it requires the payment of money to those not entitled to it,\r\nsince it is shown that these consols could not have been destroyed at\r\nthe time stated, because coupons due on all consols of that denomination\r\nunredeemed have been paid since that date.\r\n\r\nWhile the objections to the payment of the amount of the other two bonds\r\nmentioned in the bill are less conclusive, there seem to be so much\r\ndoubt and uncertainty concerning their description and character, and\r\ntheir identification as unredeemed consols of 1867 is so unsatisfactory,\r\nthat, in my opinion, it is not safe to assume, as is done in this bill,\r\nthat they are represented among those bonds of that class recorded as\r\nstill outstanding whose coupons for some reason have not been presented\r\nfor payment since July 1, 1872.\r\n\r\nI do not believe that an indemnity bond could be drawn which, as against\r\nthe strict rights of sureties, would protect the Government against\r\ndouble liability in case all the payments directed by this bill were\r\nmade. Even if the payments were confined to the two larger consols\r\ndescribed, there would be great difficulty in framing a bond which would\r\nsurely indemnify the Government.\r\n\r\nThere should always be a willingness to save the holders of Government\r\nsecurities from damage through their loss or destruction, but, in my\r\njudgment, a bad precedent would be established by paying obligations\r\nwhose destruction and identification are not more satisfactorily\r\nestablished than in this case.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 19, 1895_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return herewith without approval House bill No. 6244, entitled \"An act\r\nto remove the charge of desertion from the military record of Jacob\r\nEckert.\"\r\n\r\nThis bill directs the Secretary of War \"to cause the records of the War\r\nDepartment to be so amended as to remove the charge of desertion from\r\nthe service record of Jacob Eckert, of New Philadelphia, Ohio, late a\r\nprivate in Company B, Sixty-first Ohio Volunteer Infantry, and to grant\r\nan honorable discharge to said Jacob Eckert from the service of the\r\nUnited States Army as of date when said company was mustered out of\r\nservice.\"\r\n\r\nThe regiment and company to which this soldier belonged, except such\r\nmembers as reenlisted as veterans, were mustered out of the service\r\nOctober 17, 1864.\r\n\r\nJacob Eckert did not reenlist and was not mustered out with his comrades\r\nfor the reason that he was then under arrest on a charge of desertion.\r\nIn November, 1864, he was tried by a general court-martial and convicted\r\nof having deserted on the 1st of September, 1864, and again on the 2d\r\nday of September, 1864, and upon such conviction he was sentenced to\r\nforfeit all pay due him from September 1, the date of his first\r\ndesertion, until the expiration of his term of service, to be\r\ndishonorably discharged and confined at hard labor for twelve months.\r\n\r\nThis sentence was approved by the reviewing authority, and I assume the\r\nconvicted soldier served his term of imprisonment, since the statement\r\ncontained in the report of the House committee to whom this bill was\r\nreferred that he was dishonorably discharged in 1865 can be accounted\r\nfor in no other way.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the provisions of this bill amount to a legislative\r\nreversal of the judgment of a regularly constituted court and a\r\nlegislative pardon of the offense of which this soldier was convicted.\r\nIf this doubtful authority is to be exercised by Congress, it should be\r\ndone in such a manner as not to restore a man properly convicted and\r\nsentenced as a deserter, without even the allegation of injustice,\r\nto the rights of pay, allowance, and pension belonging to those who\r\nfaithfully and honorably served in the military service of their\r\ncountry according to the terms of their enlistment.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 20, 1895_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI return herewith without approval Senate bill No. 1526, entitled \"An\r\nact for the relief of Henry Halteman.\"\r\n\r\nThis bill directs the Secretary of War \"to grant an honorable discharge\r\nfrom the United States service to Henry Halteman, late of Company F,\r\nSecond United States Artillery.\"\r\n\r\nIt is conceded that this soldier enlisted in the Regular Army on the\r\n18th day of December, 1860, for the term of five years and that he\r\ndeserted on the 18th day of August, 1865. The only excuse or palliation\r\noffered for his offense is found in the statement that his desertion\r\nwas provoked by his company's being ordered to California so near the\r\ntermination of his enlistment that his term would have expired before\r\nor soon after his company could have reached California, and \"that his\r\nreturn would have been both tedious and somewhat perilous, if not\r\nexpensive.\"\r\n\r\nThe fact must not be overlooked that this soldier enlisted in the\r\nRegular Army and that his term had no relation to the duration of the\r\nwar or the immediate need of the Government for troops at the time of\r\nhis desertion. The morale and discipline of the Regular Army are\r\ntherefore directly involved in the proposed legislation.\r\n\r\nThe soldier's name remained on the records of the War Department as\r\na deserter at large for twenty-three years, and until the year 1888.\r\nIn August of that year application was made to the Department for the\r\nremoval of the charge of desertion against him, which was refused on\r\nthe ground that it was not shown that such charge was founded in error.\r\nThereupon he applied for a discharge without character, as it is called,\r\nas of the date of his desertion. This was granted on the 21st day of\r\nSeptember, 1888. Such discharges, which were not uncommon at that time,\r\nomitted the certificate of character which entitled the soldier to\r\nreenlistment.\r\n\r\nIn 1892 a bill similar to that now under consideration was referred\r\nto the Adjutant-General of the Army and was returned with an adverse\r\nreport.\r\n\r\nThe record of the War Department on the subject of this soldier's\r\nseparation from the Army is absolutely correct as it stands, and no\r\nsufficient reason is apparent why another record should be substituted.\r\nIf this deserter is to be allowed an honorable discharge, I do not see\r\nwhy every deserter should not be absolved from the consequences of his\r\nunfaithfulness.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this bill if it should become a law would be to allow\r\nthe beneficiary not only a pensionable status, but arrears of pay and\r\nclothing allowances up to the date of his desertion and travel allowance\r\nfrom the place of his desertion to the place of his enlistment.\r\n\r\nIt is not denied that all these things have been justly forfeited by\r\ndeliberate and inexcusable desertion. In the case presented it seems to\r\nme that the laws and regulations adopted for the purpose of maintaining\r\nthe discipline and efficiency of the Army ought not to be set aside.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 23, 1895_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return herewith without approval House bill No. 8165, entitled \"An\r\nact authorizing the Kansas City, Oklahoma and Pacific Railway Company\r\nto construct and operate a railway through Indian reservations in the\r\nIndian Territory and the Territories of Oklahoma and New Mexico, and\r\nfor other purposes.\"\r\n\r\nThis bill contains concessions more comprehensive and sweeping than\r\nany ever presented for my approval, and it seems to me the rights and\r\ninterests of the Indians and the Government are the least protected.\r\n\r\nThe route apparently desired, though passing through or into one State\r\nand three Territories, is described as indefinitely as possible, and\r\ndoes not seem to be subject to the approval in its entirety of the\r\nSecretary of the Interior or any other governmental agency having\r\nrelation to the interest involved.\r\n\r\nThere is no provision for obtaining the consent of the Indians through\r\nwhose territory and reservations the railroad may be located.\r\n\r\nThough it is proposed to build the railroad through territories having\r\nlocal courts convenient to their inhabitants, all controversies that may\r\narise out of the location and building of the road are by the provisions\r\nof the bill to be passed upon by the United States circuit and district\r\ncourts for the district of Kansas \"and such other courts as may be\r\nauthorized by Congress.\"\r\n\r\nThe bill provides that \"the civil jurisdiction of said courts is\r\nhereby extended within the limits of said Indian reservations, without\r\ndistinction as to citizenship of the parties, so far as may be necessary\r\nto carry out the provisions of this act.\" This provision permits the\r\nsubordination of the jurisdiction of Indian courts, which we are bound\r\nby treaty to protect, to the \"provisions of this act\" and to the\r\ninterests and preferences of the railroad company for whose benefit the\r\nbill under consideration is intended.\r\n\r\nA plan of appraisal is provided for in the bill in case an agreement\r\ncan not be reached as to the amount of compensation to be paid for the\r\ntaking of lands held by individual occupants according to the laws,\r\ncustoms, and usages of any of the Indian nations or tribes or by\r\nallotment or agreement with the Indians. It is, however, further\r\nprovided that in case either party is dissatisfied with the award of the\r\nreferees to be appointed an appeal may be taken to the district court\r\nheld at Wichita, Kans., no matter where on the proposed route of the\r\nroad the controversy may originate. If upon the hearing of said appeal\r\nthe judgment of the court shall be for the same sum as the award of the\r\nreferees, the costs shall be adjudged against the appellant, and if said\r\njudgment shall be for a smaller sum the costs shall be adjudged against\r\nthe party claiming damages. It does not seem to me that the interests of\r\nan Indian occupant or allottee are properly regarded when he is obliged,\r\nif dissatisfied with an award for the taking of his land, to go to the\r\ndistrict court of Kansas for redress, at the risk of incurring costs and\r\nexpenses that may not only exceed the award originally made to him, but\r\nleave him in debt.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that there are other valid objections to this bill.\r\nI have only attempted to suggest enough to justify my action in\r\ndisapproving it.\r\n\r\nIn constructing legislation of this description it should not be\r\nforgotten that the rights and interests of the Indians are important in\r\nevery view and should be scrupulously protected.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 23, 1895_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return herewith without approval House bill No. 5740, entitled \"An act\r\nincorporating the Society of American Florists.\"\r\n\r\nNo sufficient reason is apparent for the incorporation of this\r\norganization under Federal laws. There is not the least difficulty in\r\nthe way of the accomplishment under State laws by the incorporators\r\nnamed in the bill of every purpose which can legitimately belong to\r\ntheir corporate existence. The creation of such a corporation by a\r\nspecial act of Congress establishes a vexatious and troublesome\r\nprecedent.\r\n\r\nThere appears to be no limit in the bill to the value of the real and\r\npersonal property which the proposed corporation may hold if acquired\r\nby donation or bequest. The limit of $50,000 applies only to property\r\nacquired by purchase.\r\n\r\nA conclusive objection to the bill is found in the fact that it fails to\r\ncarry out the purposes and objects of those interested in its passage.\r\nThe promoters of the bill are florists, who undoubtedly seek to advance\r\nfloriculture. The declared object of the proposed incorporation is,\r\nhowever, stated in the bill to be \"the elevation and advancement of\r\nhorticulture in all its branches, to increase and diffuse the knowledge\r\nthereof, and for kindred purposes in the interest of horticulture.\"\r\n\r\nIt is entirely clear that the interests of florists would be badly\r\nserved by a corporation confined to the furtherance of garden culture.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 23, 1895_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return herewith without approval House bill No. 4658, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to Hiram R. Rhea and repealing an act approved March\r\n3, 1871.\"\r\n\r\nThe person named in the title of this bill was pensioned under the\r\nprovisions of a private act passed March 3, 1871. In 1892 a letter from\r\nthe Commissioner of Pensions was presented to Congress exhibiting facts\r\nwhich established in a most satisfactory manner that the claim for\r\npension allowed by said special act was a barefaced and impudent fraud,\r\nsupported by deliberate perjury. This letter appears to be the moving\r\ncause of the passage of the bill now before me. Payment of pension under\r\nthe fraudulent act has been suspended since January 28, 1893, and since\r\nthat time no information has been received from the fraudulent pensioner.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances developed called for the repeal of the law of 1871\r\nlacing him upon the pension roll. This is accomplished in the second\r\nsection of the bill under consideration, which section I would be glad\r\nto approve. This repeal, however, is accompanied by a provision in the\r\nfirst section of the bill directing the Secretary of the Interior to\r\nplace upon the pension roll this identical fraudulent pensioner, under\r\na certificate numbered precisely the same as that heretofore issued to\r\nhim, \"at a rate proportionate to the degree of disability from such\r\ngunshot wounds as may be shown to the satisfaction of said Secretary to\r\nhave been received at the hands of Confederate soldiers or sympathizers\r\nwhile said Rhea was attempting to cooperate with the Union forces,\" etc.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the letter of the Commissioner of Pensions to which\r\nreference has been made, and which forms part of the committee's report\r\non this bill, is the basis of this repealing provision, and inasmuch as\r\nthis letter furnishes evidence that the pensioner was when injured a\r\nvery disreputable member of a band of armed rebels and was wounded by\r\nUnion soldiers, I can not understand why the same bill which for this\r\nreason purges the pension rolls of his name should in the same breath\r\nundo this work and direct his name to be rewritten on the rolls.\r\n\r\nIf the facts before Congress justify the repeal of the law under which\r\nthis man fraudulently received a pension for nearly twenty-two years,\r\nthey certainly do not justify the provision directing his name to be put\r\non the rolls again with a view to further examination of his case or for\r\nany other purpose.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 27, 1895_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return herewith without approval House bill No. 2051, entitled \"An act\r\nto grant a pension to Eunice Putman.\"\r\n\r\nThis bill provides for a pension to the beneficiary therein named as the\r\nhelpless daughter of John Putman, who served as a private in the War of\r\nthe Rebellion from August 27, 1864, to June 2, 1865. In 1870, when the\r\nbeneficiary was not 2 years old, her mother died, and her father married\r\nagain in 1872. He applied for a pension in 1884, but died the same year.\r\nHis claim was allowed, however, in 1891, and his pension which had\r\naccrued between the date of his application and his death was paid to\r\nhis widow, Jeanette S. Putman. Immediately thereafter a pension was\r\nallowed the widow in her own right, dating from the soldier's death, in\r\n1884, with $2 additional per month for each of the two minor children.\r\nThe beneficiary was not included because she had reached the age of 16\r\nyears prior to her father's death.\r\n\r\nThe report of the committee to whom this bill was referred states that\r\nno claim for pension on account of the soldier's death has ever been\r\nfiled in the Pension Bureau, and it seems that upon this theory it was\r\nproposed to pension the daughter. I do not suppose it was intended that\r\na double pension should be allowed. In point of fact, the widow has\r\nalready been pensioned, and no such pension allowance has been made for\r\nthe minor children. There is no suggestion that the widow has died or\r\nremarried.\r\n\r\nIf this bill should become a law, two full pensions would be in force at\r\nthe same time, one to the widow and another to the daughter, each\r\npredicated upon the services and death of the same soldier.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 27, 1895_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return without approval House bill No. 6868, entitled \"An act\r\nfor the relief of Catherine Ott, widow of Joseph Ott.\"\r\n\r\nAn application by the beneficiary named in this bill, under the law of\r\n1890, was rejected on the ground that her husband died in the service,\r\nand therefore had not been honorably discharged, as required by that\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nIt appears that after he had served a number of years in a cavalry\r\nregiment, and having been once discharged for reenlistment, he was\r\ntransferred to the Veteran Reserve Corps and was in that service at the\r\ntime of his death.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances the rejection of the beneficiary's claim on the\r\nground stated is held, under present rulings of the Pension Bureau, to\r\nhave been erroneous, and such claim can now be favorably adjudicated\r\nupon proof of continued widowhood of the applicant and the lack of other\r\nmeans of support than her daily labor.\r\n\r\nIf such proof is supplied, she would be entitled to a pension dating\r\nfrom July 14, 1890, which would be much more advantageous than the\r\nrelief afforded by the bill herewith returned.\r\n\r\nIf the beneficiary can justly claim a pension dating from her\r\napplication to the Pension Bureau in 1890, the benefits accruing to her\r\ntherefrom should not be superseded by this special legislation, which\r\nallows relief only from the date of its enactment.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 28, 1895_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return without approval House bill No. 8681, entitled \"An act\r\nauthorizing the Arkansas Northwestern Railway Company to construct and\r\noperate a railway through the Indian Territory, and for other purposes.\"\r\n\r\nThe contemplated route of this railway, so far as it is disclosed in the\r\nbill, would run from a point in the southwestern corner of the State of\r\nMissouri, across the northeastern corner of the Indian Territory, to\r\na point in the southeastern part of the State of Kansas. This route\r\nnecessarily runs through the lands of the Cherokee Indians or through\r\nthe small reservations of the Quapaws, the Peorias, the Ottawas, the\r\nWyandottes, and the Senecas.\r\n\r\nThere is no provision in the bill requiring the consent of the Indians\r\nwhose lands are to be thus traversed.\r\n\r\nThere is no provision requiring the entire line to be located and\r\napproved by the Secretary of the Interior before the work of building\r\nis commenced.\r\n\r\nThe bill provides for compensation to individual occupants or allottees\r\nby a process of appraisal by referees, with the right of appeal to the\r\ndistrict court held at Fort Smith, in the State of Arkansas.\r\n\r\nIn the case of allotted land or land held in individual occupancy by\r\nthe Indians great care should be exercised in interfering with their\r\nholdings. Their land is given them for cultivation and with a view of\r\nmaking them self-supporting and industrious citizens. If their land is\r\ninvaded and cut up by railroads, the purpose of allotment is in danger\r\nof being defeated. Money compensation is of but little use to them, and\r\nno amount can compensate for the disturbance in the cultivation of their\r\nlands and their consequent discontent and discouragement.\r\n\r\nThese considerations, it seems to me, emphasize the necessity of the\r\nexact location of the entire line of the contemplated railroad and such\r\ncontrol over it by the Secretary of the Interior as will enable him to\r\navoid as much as possible interference with individual Indian occupants\r\nand other difficulties.\r\n\r\nThis supervision and regulation of the line can be done with much more\r\nsafety and effectiveness in considering the entire line than it can be\r\ndone in sections of 25 miles each, as is provided in the bill.\r\n\r\nThe United States circuit and district courts for the districts of\r\nKansas and the district of Arkansas and such other courts as may\r\nbe authorized by Congress are given concurrent jurisdiction of all\r\ncontroversies arising between the railway company and the nations\r\nand tribes of Indians through whose territory the railway shall be\r\nconstructed, or between said company and the members of said nations or\r\ntribes, without reference to the amount in controversy, and the civil\r\njurisdiction of said courts is extended within the limits of said Indian\r\nTerritory, without distinction as to the citizenship of parties, so far\r\nas may be necessary to carry out the provisions of the act.\r\n\r\nThe requirement that an Indian shall be obliged to seek a distant court\r\nfor the adjudication of his rights in his controversies, great and\r\nsmall, with this railway company would result in many cases to a denial\r\nof justice.\r\n\r\nI am convinced of the growing necessity, in this period of change in our\r\nrelations with the Indians, of caution and certainty in the grants given\r\nto railroads to pass through Indian lands and of the exercise of care in\r\nallowing interference with their occupation.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 28, 1895_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return without approval House bill No. 5624, entitled \"An act\r\nto authorize the Oklahoma Central Railroad to construct and operate a\r\nrailway through the Indian and Oklahoma Territories, and for other\r\npurposes.\"\r\n\r\nThe railroad proposed to be built under authority of this bill commences\r\nat a point in the Creek Nation called Sapulpa and runs through the\r\nIndian Territory to Oklahoma City, in Oklahoma, and thence through the\r\nKiowa and Comanche Reservation to a point at or near the Red River, on\r\nthe west line of said reservation.\r\n\r\nThere is no provision in this bill requiring the consent of the Indians\r\nthrough whose lands it is proposed to build the road.\r\n\r\nThe character and situation of these Indians are such as to make this\r\nconsent important.\r\n\r\nThe first section gives the railroad company the right to build not only\r\nits line of road, but \"such tracks, turn-outs, branches, sidings, and\r\nextensions as said company may deem it to their interest to construct.\"\r\n\r\nIf under an apparent grant to build a railroad the route of which is\r\nin a general way defined this company is to be allowed to build such\r\nbranches and extensions as it may deem it to its interest to construct,\r\nthe grant, I am sure, is more comprehensive than was intended by the\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the entire line of the proposed railroad should be\r\nprecisely located and subjected to the approval of the Secretary of the\r\nInterior before the work of construction is entered upon. This bill\r\nprovides that it shall be approved in sections of 25 miles before\r\nconstruction on such sections shall be commenced.\r\n\r\nOur relations to the Indians on reservations and their welfare and quiet\r\nare better preserved and protected when the entire line of road can be\r\nsettled upon at one time and all uncertainty and doubt on the subject\r\nremoved.

When a soldier shall be convicted of an offense the\r\npunishment for which, as authorized by Article II of this order\r\nor the custom of the service, does not exceed that which an inferior\r\ncourt-martial may award, the punishment so authorized may be increased\r\nby one-half for every previous conviction of one or more offenses within\r\neighteen months preceding the trial and during the current enlistment:\r\n_Provided_, That the increase of punishment for five or more\r\nprevious convictions shall not exceed that thus authorized when there\r\nare four previous convictions, and that when one or more of such five or\r\nmore previous convictions shall have been by general court-martial or\r\nwhen such convictions shall have occurred within one year preceding\r\nthe trial the limit of punishment shall be dishonorable discharge,\r\nforfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement at hard labor for\r\nthree months.\r\n\r\nWhen the conviction is of an offense punishable under Article II of this\r\norder or the custom of the service with a greater punishment than an\r\ninferior court-martial can award, but not punishable with dishonorable\r\ndischarge, the sentence may on proof of five or more previous\r\nconvictions within eighteen months and during the current enlistment\r\nimpose dishonorable discharge and forfeiture of all pay and allowances\r\nin addition to the authorized confinement, and when this confinement is\r\nless than three months it may be increased to three months.\r\n\r\nWhen a noncommissioned officer is convicted of an offense not punishable\r\nwith reduction, he may, if he shall have been convicted of a military\r\noffense within a year and during the current enlistment, be sentenced to\r\nreduction in addition to the punishment already authorized.\r\n\r\nSEC. 2. In every case when an offense on trial before a court-martial\r\nis of a character admitting of the introduction of evidence of previous\r\nconvictions and the accused is convicted the court, after determining\r\nits findings, will be opened for the purpose of ascertaining whether\r\nthere is such evidence, and, if so, of hearing it. These convictions\r\nmust be proved by the records of previous trials or by duly authenticated\r\norders promulgating the same, except in the cases of conviction by\r\nsummary court, when a duly authenticated copy of the record of said\r\ncourt shall be deemed sufficient proof. Charges forwarded to the\r\nauthority ordering a general court-martial or submitted to a summary,\r\ngarrison, or regimental court must be accompanied by the proper evidence\r\nof such previous convictions as may have to be considered in determining\r\nupon a sentence.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE IV.\r\n\r\nWhen a soldier shall on one arraignment be convicted of two or more\r\noffenses none of which is punishable under Article II of this order or\r\nthe custom of the service with dishonorable discharge, but the aggregate\r\nterm of confinement for which may exceed six months, dishonorable\r\ndischarge with forfeiture of pay and allowances may be awarded in\r\naddition to the authorized confinement.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE V.\r\n\r\nThis order prescribes the _maximum_ limit of punishment for the\r\noffenses named, and this limit is intended for those cases in which the\r\nseverest punishment should be awarded. In other cases the punishment\r\nshould be graded down according to the extenuating circumstances.\r\nOffenses not herein provided for remain punishable as authorized by the\r\nArticles of War and the custom of the service.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE VI.\r\n\r\nSummary courts are subject to the restrictions named in the eighty-third\r\narticle of war. Soldiers against whom charges may be preferred for trial\r\nby summary court shall not be confined in the guardhouse, but shall be\r\nplaced in arrest in quarters before and during trial and while awaiting\r\nsentence, except when in particular cases restraint may be necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE VII.\r\n\r\nThe following substitutions for punishments named in Article II of this\r\norder are authorized at the discretion of the court:\r\n\r\nTwo days' confinement at hard labor for $1 forfeiture; one day's\r\nsolitary confinement on bread and water diet for two days' confinement\r\nat hard labor or for $1 forfeiture: _Provided_, That a noncommissioned\r\nofficer not sentenced to reduction shall not be subject to confinement:\r\n_And provided_, That solitary confinement shall not exceed fourteen\r\ndays at one time nor be repeated until fourteen days have elapsed, and\r\nshall not exceed eighty-four days in one year. Whenever the limit herein\r\nprescribed for an offense or offenses may be brought within the\r\npunishing power of inferior courts-martial, as defined by the\r\neighty-third article of war, by substitution of punishment under the\r\nprovisions of this article, the said courts have jurisdiction of such\r\noffense or offenses.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE VIII.\r\n\r\nNoncommissioned officers above the rank of corporal shall not, if they\r\nobject thereto, be brought to trial before regimental, garrison, or\r\nsummary courts-martial without the authority of the officer competent to\r\norder their trial by general court-martial, nor shall sergeants of the\r\npost noncommissioned staff or hospital stewards be reduced, but they may\r\nbe dishonorably discharged whenever reduction is included in the limit\r\nof punishment.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: See pp. 167-172.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: Upon trial for desertion and conviction of absence without\r\nleave only, the court may, in addition to the limit prescribed for such\r\nabsence, award a stoppage of the amount paid for apprehension.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: Including first and excluding last.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: In specifications to charges of larceny or embezzlement the\r\nvalue of the property shall be stated.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAMENDMENT OF CIVIL-SERVICE RULES.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _April 15, 1895_.\r\n\r\nWhereas on November 2, 1894, Departmental Rule II, section 4, Customs\r\nRule II, section 6, Postal Rule II, section 6, Railway Mail Rule II,\r\nsection 6, were amended to declare that no person appointed to a place\r\nunder any exception to examination should be transferred from such place\r\nto another place not also excepted from examination; and\r\n\r\nWhereas it was not my intention that these several amendments should be\r\nretroactive in their effect:\r\n\r\nI therefore direct that the word \"hereafter\" be inserted after the word\r\n\"person\" in the first line of each of said sections as of the date of\r\nsaid amendments, viz, November 2, 1894.\r\n\r\nApproved: GROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCIVIL SERVICE.--INTERNAL-REVENUE RULES.\r\n\r\nADOPTING AND PROMULGATING ORDER.\r\n\r\nMAY 7, 1895.\r\n\r\nIn the exercise of the power vested in him by the Constitution, by the\r\nseventeen hundred and fifty-third section of the Revised Statutes, and\r\nthe act entitled \"An act to regulate and improve the civil service of\r\nthe United States,\" approved January 16, 1883, the President hereby\r\nmakes and promulgates the following rules concerning the classified\r\ninternal-revenue service, to be known as the Internal-Revenue Rules:\r\n\r\n\r\n  INTERNAL-REVENUE RULE I.\r\n\r\n  The classified internal-revenue service shall include all the clerks,\r\n  storekeepers, storekeepers and gaugers, and gaugers classified under the\r\n  provisions of section 6 of the act to regulate and improve the civil\r\n  service of the United States, approved January 16, 1883.\r\n\r\n\r\n  INTERNAL-REVENUE RULE II.\r\n\r\n  1.

If the Commissioner decides that the good of the\r\n  public service requires that it be filled, he shall request the\r\n  secretary of the board of examiners of that district to certify to him\r\n  the names of persons eligible to the vacant place.\r\n\r\n  (_b_) If fitness for the vacant place is tested by competitive\r\n  examination, the names of the three eligibles highest in grade on the\r\n  proper register who have not been three times certified shall be\r\n  certified; but if the request indicates the sex of the eligibles desired\r\n  the three highest in grade of that sex shall be certified: _Provided_,\r\n  That the eligibles upon any register who have been allowed preference\r\n  under section 1754 of the Revised Statutes shall be certified,\r\n  according to their grade, before all other eligibles thereon:\r\n  _Provided further_, That no certification for an appointment shall\r\n  be made under this clause while there are persons in the district in\r\n  which any vacancy may exist, who have been removed from the service in\r\n  that district on account of a reduction of the force or otherwise, who\r\n  are eligible for reinstatement under Internal-Revenue Rule VII, and who\r\n  are willing to reenter the service by reinstatement. Every collector of\r\n  internal revenue shall keep a list of all such persons in his office,\r\n  and said persons shall have preference for reinstatement to the service\r\n  in the order of their separation therefrom.\r\n\r\n  (_c_) No eligible shall be certified more than three times.\r\n\r\n  2. Of the three names certified to him the Commissioner of Internal\r\n  Revenue shall select one, and may select more than one if more than one\r\n  vacancy exists at the time the certification is made. If the vacancy is\r\n  in the class of clerk, the Commissioner shall certify the name of the\r\n  person selected by him to the collector of the district in which the\r\n  vacancy occurs and the collector shall make the appointment.

The reports of\r\nthe heads of the several administrative Departments of the Government\r\nfully and plainly exhibit what has been accomplished within the scope\r\nof their respective duties and present such recommendations for the\r\nbetterment of our country's condition as patriotic and intelligent labor\r\nand observation suggest.\r\n\r\nI therefore deem my executive duty adequately performed at this time\r\nby presenting to the Congress the important phases of our situation as\r\nrelated to our intercourse with foreign nations and a statement of the\r\nfinancial problems which confront us, omitting, except as they are\r\nrelated to these topics, any reference to departmental operations.\r\n\r\nI earnestly invite, however, not only the careful consideration but the\r\nseverely critical scrutiny of the Congress and my fellow-countrymen to\r\nthe reports concerning these departmental operations. If justly and\r\nfairly examined, they will furnish proof of assiduous and painstaking\r\ncare for the public welfare. I press the recommendations they contain\r\nupon the respectful attention of those charged with the duty of\r\nlegislation, because I believe their adoption would promote the people's\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nBy amendatory tariff legislation in January last the Argentine Republic,\r\nrecognizing the value of the large market opened to the free importation\r\nof its wools under our last tariff act, has admitted certain products\r\nof the United States to entry at reduced duties. It is pleasing to note\r\nthat the efforts we have made to enlarge the exchanges of trade on a\r\nsound basis of mutual benefit are in this instance appreciated by the\r\ncountry from which our woolen factories draw their needful supply of raw\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\nThe Missions boundary dispute between the Argentine Republic and Brazil,\r\nreferred to the President of the United States as arbitrator during the\r\nterm of my predecessor, and which was submitted to me for determination,\r\nresulted in an award in favor of Brazil upon the historical and\r\ndocumentary evidence presented, thus ending a long-protracted\r\ncontroversy and again demonstrating the wisdom and desirability of\r\nsettling international boundary disputes by recourse to friendly\r\narbitration.\r\n\r\nNegotiations are progressing for a revival of the United States and\r\nChilean Claims Commission, whose work was abruptly terminated last year\r\nby the expiration of the stipulated time within which awards could be\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nThe resumption of specie payments by Chile is a step of great interest\r\nand importance both in its direct consequences upon her own welfare and\r\nas evincing the ascendency of sound financial principles in one of the\r\nmost influential of the South American Republics.\r\n\r\nThe close of the momentous struggle between China and Japan, while\r\nrelieving the diplomatic agents of this Government from the delicate\r\nduty they undertook at the request of both countries of rendering such\r\nservice to the subjects of either belligerent within the territorial\r\nlimits of the other as our neutral position permitted, developed\r\na domestic condition in the Chinese Empire which has caused much\r\nanxiety and called for prompt and careful attention. Either as a\r\nresult of a weak control by the central Government over the provincial\r\nadministrations, following a diminution of traditional governmental\r\nauthority under the stress of an overwhelming national disaster, or as\r\na manifestation upon good opportunity of the aversion of the Chinese\r\npopulation to all foreign ways and undertakings, there have occurred\r\nin widely separated provinces of China serious outbreaks of the old\r\nfanatical spirit against foreigners, which, unchecked by the local\r\nauthorities, if not actually connived at by them, have culminated in\r\nmob attacks on foreign missionary stations, causing much destruction of\r\nproperty and attended with personal injuries as well as loss of life.\r\n\r\nAlthough but one American citizen was reported to have been actually\r\nwounded, and although the destruction of property may have fallen more\r\nheavily upon the missionaries of other nationalities than our own, it\r\nplainly behooved this Government to take the most prompt and decided\r\naction to guard against similar or perhaps more dreadful calamities\r\nbefalling the hundreds of American mission stations which have grown up\r\nthroughout the interior of China under the temperate rule of toleration,\r\ncustom, and imperial edict. The demands of the United States and other\r\npowers for the degradation and punishment of the responsible officials\r\nof the respective cities and provinces who by neglect or otherwise had\r\npermitted uprisings, and for the adoption of stern measures by the\r\nEmperor's Government for the protection of the life and property of\r\nforeigners, were followed by the disgrace and dismissal of certain\r\nprovincial officials found derelict in duty and the punishment by death\r\nof a number of those adjudged guilty of actual participation in the\r\noutrages.\r\n\r\nThis Government also insisted that a special American commission should\r\nvisit the province where the first disturbances occurred for the purpose\r\nof investigation. The latter commission, formed after much opposition,\r\nhas gone overland from Tientsin, accompanied by a suitable Chinese\r\nescort, and by its demonstration of the readiness and ability of our\r\nGovernment to protect its citizens will act, it is believed, as a most\r\ninfluential deterrent of any similar outbreaks.\r\n\r\nThe energetic steps we have thus taken are all the more likely to\r\nresult in future safety to our citizens in China because the Imperial\r\nGovernment is, I am persuaded, entirely convinced that we desire only\r\nthe liberty and protection of our own citizens and redress for any\r\nwrongs they may have suffered, and that we have no ulterior designs or\r\nobjects, political or otherwise. China will not forget either our kindly\r\nservice to her citizens during her late war nor the further fact that,\r\nwhile furnishing all the facilities at our command to further the\r\nnegotiation of a peace between her and Japan, we sought no advantages\r\nand interposed no counsel.\r\n\r\nThe Governments of both China and Japan have, in special dispatches\r\ntransmitted through their respective diplomatic representatives,\r\nexpressed in a most pleasing manner their grateful appreciation of our\r\nassistance to their citizens during the unhappy struggle and of the\r\nvalue of our aid in paving the way to their resumption of peaceful\r\nrelations.\r\n\r\nThe customary cordial relations between this country and France have\r\nbeen undisturbed, with the exception that a full explanation of the\r\ntreatment of John L. Waller by the expeditionary military authorities\r\nof France still remains to be given. Mr. Waller, formerly United States\r\nconsul at Tamatav, remained in Madagascar after his term of office\r\nexpired, and was apparently successful in procuring business concessions\r\nfrom the Hovas of greater or less value. After the occupation of Tamatav\r\nand the declaration of martial law by the French he was arrested upon\r\nvarious charges, among them that of communicating military information\r\nto the enemies of France, was tried and convicted by a military\r\ntribunal, and sentenced to twenty years' imprisonment.\r\n\r\nFollowing the course justified by abundant precedents, this Government\r\nrequested from that of France the record of the proceedings of the\r\nFrench tribunal which resulted in Mr. Waller's condemnation. This\r\nrequest has been complied with to the extent of supplying a copy of the\r\nofficial record, from which appear the constitution and organization of\r\nthe court, the charges as formulated, and the general course and result\r\nof the trial, and by which it is shown that the accused was tried in\r\nopen court and was defended by counsel; but the evidence adduced in\r\nsupport of the charges, which was not received by the French minister\r\nfor foreign affairs till the first week in October, has thus far been\r\nwithheld, the French Government taking the ground that its production in\r\nresponse to our demand would establish a bad precedent. The efforts of\r\nour ambassador to procure it, however, though impeded by recent changes\r\nin the French ministry, have not been relaxed, and it is confidently\r\nexpected that some satisfactory solution of the matter will shortly be\r\nreached. Meanwhile it appears that Mr. Waller's confinement has every\r\nalleviation which the state of his health and all the other\r\ncircumstances of the case demand or permit.\r\n\r\nIn agreeable contrast to the difference above noted respecting a matter\r\nof common concern, where nothing is sought except such a mutually\r\nsatisfactory outcome as the true merits of the case require, is the\r\nrecent resolution of a permanent treaty of arbitration between the two\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nAn invitation has been extended by France to the Government and people\r\nof the United States to participate in a great international exposition\r\nat Paris in 1900 as a suitable commemoration of the close of this the\r\nworld's marvelous century of progress. I heartily recommend its\r\nacceptance, together with such legislation as will adequately provide\r\nfor a due representation of this Government and its people on the\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nOur relations with the States of the German Empire are in some aspects\r\ntypical of a condition of things elsewhere found in countries whose\r\nproductions and trade are similar to our own. The close rivalries of\r\ncompeting industries; the influence of the delusive doctrine that the\r\ninternal development of a nation is promoted and its wealth increased\r\nby a policy which, in undertaking to reserve its home markets for the\r\nexclusive use of its own producers, necessarily obstructs their sales\r\nin foreign markets and prevents free access to the products of the\r\nworld; the desire to retain trade in time-worn ruts, regardless of\r\nthe inexorable laws of new needs and changed conditions of demand and\r\nsupply, and our own halting tardiness in inviting a freer exchange of\r\ncommodities, and by this means imperiling our footing in the external\r\nmarkets naturally open to us, have created a situation somewhat\r\ninjurious to American export interests, not only in Germany, where they\r\nare perhaps most noticeable, but in adjacent countries. The exports\r\naffected are largely American cattle and other food products, the reason\r\nassigned for unfavorable discrimination being that their consumption is\r\ndeleterious to the public health. This is all the more irritating in\r\nview of the fact that no European state is as jealous of the excellence\r\nand wholesomeness of its exported food supplies as the United States,\r\nnor so easily able, on account of inherent soundness, to guarantee those\r\nqualities.\r\n\r\nNor are these difficulties confined to our food products designed for\r\nexportation. Our great insurance companies, for example, having built\r\nup a vast business abroad and invested a large share of their gains in\r\nforeign countries in compliance with the local laws and regulations then\r\nexisting, now find themselves within a narrowing circle of onerous and\r\nunforeseen conditions, and are confronted by the necessity of retirement\r\nfrom a field thus made unprofitable, if, indeed, they are not summarily\r\nexpelled, as some of them have lately been from Prussia.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be forgotten that international trade can not be one-sided.\r\nIts currents are alternating, and its movements should be honestly\r\nreciprocal. Without this it almost necessarily degenerates into a device\r\nto gain advantage or a contrivance to secure benefits with only the\r\nsemblance of a return. In our dealings with other nations we ought\r\nto be open-handed and scrupulously fair. This should be our policy\r\nas a producing nation, and it plainly becomes us as a people who love\r\ngenerosity and the moral aspects of national good faith and reciprocal\r\nforbearance.\r\n\r\nThese considerations should not, however, constrain us to submit to\r\nunfair discrimination nor to silently acquiesce in vexatious hindrances\r\nto the enjoyment of our share of the legitimate advantages of proper\r\ntrade relations. If an examination of the situation suggests such\r\nmeasures on our part as would involve restrictions similar to those from\r\nwhich we suffer, the way to such a course is easy. It should, however,\r\nby no means be lightly entered upon, since the necessity for the\r\ninauguration of such a policy would be regretted by the best sentiment\r\nof our people and because it naturally and logically might lead to\r\nconsequences of the gravest character.\r\n\r\nI take pleasure in calling to your attention the encomiums bestowed on\r\nthose vessels of our new Navy which took part in the notable ceremony of\r\nthe opening of the Kiel Canal. It was fitting that this extraordinary\r\nachievement of the newer German nationality should be celebrated in the\r\npresence of America's exposition of the latest developments of the\r\nworld's naval energy.\r\n\r\nOur relations with Great Britain, always intimate and important, have\r\ndemanded during the past year even a greater share of consideration than\r\nis usual.\r\n\r\nSeveral vexatious questions were left undetermined by the decision of\r\nthe Bering Sea Arbitration Tribunal. The application of the principles\r\nlaid down by that august body has not been followed by the results they\r\nwere intended to accomplish, either because the principles themselves\r\nlacked in breadth and definiteness or because their execution has been\r\nmore or less imperfect. Much correspondence has been exchanged between\r\nthe two Governments on the subject of preventing the exterminating\r\nslaughter of seals. The insufficiency of the British patrol of Bering\r\nSea under the regulations agreed on by the two Governments has been\r\npointed out, and yet only two British ships have been on police duty\r\nduring this season in those waters.\r\n\r\nThe need of a more effective enforcement of existing regulations as well\r\nas the adoption of such additional regulations as experience has shown\r\nto be absolutely necessary to carry out the intent of the award have\r\nbeen earnestly urged upon the British Government, but thus far without\r\neffective results. In the meantime the depletion of the seal herds by\r\nmeans of pelagic hunting has so alarmingly progressed that unless their\r\nslaughter is at once effectively checked their extinction within a few\r\nyears seems to be a matter of absolute certainty.\r\n\r\nThe understanding by which the United States was to pay and Great\r\nBritain to receive a lump sum of $425,000 in full settlement of\r\nall British claims for damages arising from our seizure of British\r\nsealing vessels unauthorized under the award of the Paris Tribunal of\r\nArbitration was not confirmed by the last Congress, which declined to\r\nmake the necessary appropriation. I am still of the opinion that this\r\narrangement was a judicious and advantageous one for the Government,\r\nand I earnestly recommend that it be again considered and sanctioned.\r\nIf, however, this does not meet with the favor of Congress, it certainly\r\nwill hardly dissent from the proposition that the Government is bound by\r\nevery consideration of honor and good faith to provide for the speedy\r\nadjustment of these claims by arbitration as the only other alternative.\r\nA treaty of arbitration has therefore been agreed upon, and will be\r\nimmediately laid before the Senate, so that in one of the modes\r\nsuggested a final settlement may be reached.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding that Great Britain originated the proposal to enforce\r\ninternational rules for the prevention of collisions at sea, based on\r\nthe recommendations of the Maritime Conference of Washington, and\r\nconcurred in, suggesting March 11, 1895, as the date to be set by\r\nproclamation for carrying these rules into general effect, Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment, having encountered opposition on the part of British\r\nshipping interests, announced its inability to accept that date, which\r\nwas consequently canceled. The entire matter is still in abeyance,\r\nwithout prospect of a better condition in the near future.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners appointed to mark the international boundary in\r\nPassamaquoddy Bay according to the description of the treaty of Ghent\r\nhave not yet fully agreed.\r\n\r\nThe completion of the preliminary survey of that Alaskan boundary which\r\nfollows the contour of the coast from the southernmost point of Prince\r\nof Wales Island until it strikes the one hundred and forty-first\r\nmeridian at or near the summit of Mount St. Elias awaits further\r\nnecessary appropriation, which is urgently recommended. This survey was\r\nundertaken under the provisions of the convention entered into by this\r\ncountry and Great Britain July 22, 1892, and the supplementary\r\nconvention of February 3, 1894.\r\n\r\nAs to the remaining section of the Alaskan boundary, which follows the\r\none hundred and forty-first meridian northwardly from Mount St. Elias\r\nto the Frozen Ocean, the settlement of which involves the physical\r\nlocation of the meridian mentioned, no conventional agreement has yet\r\nbeen made. The ascertainment of a given meridian at a particular point\r\nis a work requiring much time and careful observations and surveys.\r\nSuch observations and surveys were undertaken by the United States Coast\r\nand Geodetic Survey in 1890 and 1891, while similar work in the same\r\nquarters, under British auspices, is believed to give nearly coincident\r\nresults; but these surveys have been independently conducted, and no\r\ninternational agreement to mark those or any other parts of the one\r\nhundred and forty-first meridian by permanent monuments has yet been\r\nmade. In the meantime the valley of the Yukon is becoming a highway\r\nthrough the hitherto unexplored wilds of Alaska, and abundant mineral\r\nwealth has been discovered in that region, especially at or near the\r\njunction of the boundary meridian with the Yukon and its tributaries. In\r\nthese circumstances it is expedient, and, indeed, imperative, that the\r\njurisdictional limits of the respective Governments in this new region\r\nbe speedily determined. Her Britannic Majesty's Government has proposed\r\na joint delimitation of the one hundred and forty-first meridian by an\r\ninternational commission of experts, which, if Congress will authorize\r\nit and make due provision therefor, can be accomplished with no\r\nunreasonable delay. It is impossible to overlook the vital importance of\r\ncontinuing the work already entered upon and supplementing it by further\r\neffective measures looking to the exact location of this entire boundary\r\nline.\r\n\r\nI call attention to the unsatisfactory delimitation of the respective\r\njurisdictions of the United States and the Dominion of Canada in the\r\nGreat Lakes at the approaches to the narrow waters that connect them.\r\nThe waters in question are frequented by fishermen of both nationalities\r\nand their nets are there used. Owing to the uncertainty and ignorance as\r\nto the true boundary, vexatious disputes and injurious seizures of boats\r\nand nets by Canadian cruisers often occur, while any positive settlement\r\nthereof by an accepted standard is not easily to be reached. A joint\r\ncommission to determine the line in those quarters on a practical basis,\r\nby measured courses following range marks on shore, is a necessity for\r\nwhich immediate provision should be made.\r\n\r\nIt being apparent that the boundary dispute between Great Britain and\r\nthe Republic of Venezuela concerning the limits of British Guiana was\r\napproaching an acute stage, a definite statement of the interest and\r\npolicy of the United States as regards the controversy seemed to be\r\nrequired both on its own account and in view of its relations with the\r\nfriendly powers directly concerned. In July last, therefore, a dispatch\r\nwas addressed to our ambassador at London for communication to the\r\nBritish Government in which the attitude of the United States was fully\r\nand distinctly set forth. The general conclusions therein reached and\r\nformulated are in substance that the traditional and established policy\r\nof this Government is firmly opposed to a forcible increase by any\r\nEuropean power of its territorial possessions on this continent; that\r\nthis policy is as well founded in principle as it is strongly supported\r\nby numerous precedents; that as a consequence the United States is bound\r\nto protest against the enlargement of the area of British Guiana in\r\nderogation of the rights and against the will of Venezuela; that\r\nconsidering the disparity in strength of Great Britain and Venezuela\r\nthe territorial dispute between them can be reasonably settled only\r\nby friendly and impartial arbitration, and that the resort to such\r\narbitration should include the whole controversy, and is not satisfied\r\nif one of the powers concerned is permitted to draw an arbitrary line\r\nthrough the territory in debate and to declare that it will submit to\r\narbitration only the portion lying on one side of it. In view of these\r\nconclusions, the dispatch in question called upon the British Government\r\nfor a definite answer to the question whether it would or would not\r\nsubmit the territorial controversy between itself and Venezuela in its\r\nentirety to impartial arbitration. The answer of the British Government\r\nhas not yet been received, but is expected shortly, when further\r\ncommunication on the subject will probably be made to the Congress.\r\n\r\nEarly in January last an uprising against the Government of Hawaii was\r\npromptly suppressed. Martial law was forthwith proclaimed and numerous\r\narrests were made of persons suspected of being in sympathy with the\r\nRoyalist party. Among these were several citizens of the United States,\r\nwho were either convicted by a military court and sentenced to death,\r\nimprisonment, or fine or were deported without trial. The United States,\r\nwhile denying protection to such as had taken the Hawaiian oath of\r\nallegiance, insisted that martial law, though altering the forms of\r\njustice, could not supersede justice itself, and demanded stay of\r\nexecution until the proceedings had been submitted to this Government\r\nand knowledge obtained therefrom that our citizens had received fair\r\ntrial. The death sentences were subsequently commuted or were remitted\r\non condition of leaving the islands. The cases of certain Americans\r\narrested and expelled by arbitrary order without formal charge or trial\r\nhave had attention, and in some instances have been found to justify\r\nremonstrance and a claim for indemnity, which Hawaii has not thus far\r\nconceded.\r\n\r\nMr. Thurston, the Hawaiian minister, having furnished this Government\r\nabundant reason for asking that he be recalled, that course was pursued,\r\nand his successor has lately been received.\r\n\r\nThe deplorable lynching of several Italian laborers in Colorado was\r\nnaturally followed by international representations, and I am happy to\r\nsay that the best efforts of the State in which the outrages occurred\r\nhave been put forth to discover and punish the authors of this atrocious\r\ncrime. The dependent families of some of the unfortunate victims invite\r\nby their deplorable condition gracious provision for their needs.\r\n\r\nThese manifestations against helpless aliens may be traced through\r\nsuccessive stages to the vicious _padroni_ system, which, unchecked\r\nby our immigration and contract-labor statutes, controls these workers\r\nfrom the moment of landing on our shores and farms them out in distant\r\nand often rude regions, where their cheapening competition in the fields\r\nof bread-winning toil brings them into collision with other labor\r\ninterests. While welcoming, as we should, those who seek our shores to\r\nmerge themselves in our body politic and win personal competence by\r\nhonest effort, we can not regard such assemblages of distinctively alien\r\nlaborers, hired out in the mass to the profit of alien speculators and\r\nshipped hither and thither as the prospect of gain may dictate, as\r\notherwise than repugnant to the spirit of our civilization, deterrent\r\nto individual advancement, and hindrances to the building up of stable\r\ncommunities resting upon the wholesome ambitions of the citizen and\r\nconstituting the prime factor in the prosperity and progress of our\r\nnation. If legislation can reach this growing evil, it certainly should\r\nbe attempted.\r\n\r\nJapan has furnished abundant evidence of her vast gain in every trait\r\nand characteristic that constitutes a nation's greatness. We have reason\r\nfor congratulation in the fact that the Government of the United States,\r\nby the exchange of liberal treaty stipulations with the new Japan, was\r\nthe first to recognize her wonderful advance and to extend to her the\r\nconsideration and confidence due to her national enlightenment and\r\nprogressive character.\r\n\r\nThe boundary dispute which lately threatened to embroil Guatemala and\r\nMexico has happily yielded to pacific counsels, and its determination\r\nhas, by the joint agreement of the parties, been submitted to the sole\r\narbitration of the United States minister to Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe commission appointed under the convention of February 18, 1889, to\r\nset new monuments along the boundary between the United States and\r\nMexico has completed its task.\r\n\r\nAs a sequel to the failure of a scheme for the colonization in Mexico\r\nof negroes, mostly immigrants from Alabama under contract, a great\r\nnumber of these helpless and suffering people, starving and smitten\r\nwith contagious disease, made their way or were assisted to the\r\nfrontier, where, in wretched plight, they were quarantined by the Texas\r\nauthorities. Learning of their destitute condition, I directed rations\r\nto be temporarily furnished them through the War Department. At the\r\nexpiration of their quarantine they were conveyed by the railway\r\ncompanies at comparatively nominal rates to their homes in Alabama, upon\r\nmy assurance, in the absence of any fund available for the cost of their\r\ntransportation, that I would recommend to Congress an appropriation for\r\nits payment. I now strongly urge upon Congress the propriety of making\r\nsuch an appropriation. It should be remembered that the measures taken\r\nwere dictated not only by sympathy and humanity, but by a conviction\r\nthat it was not compatible with the dignity of this Government that so\r\nlarge a body of our dependent citizens should be thrown for relief upon\r\nthe charity of a neighboring state.\r\n\r\nIn last year's message I narrated at some length the jurisdictional\r\nquestions then freshly arisen in the Mosquito Indian Strip of Nicaragua.\r\nSince that time, by the voluntary act of the Mosquito Nation, the\r\nterritory reserved to them has been incorporated with Nicaragua, the\r\nIndians formally subjecting themselves to be governed by the general\r\nlaws and regulations of the Republic instead of by their own customs and\r\nregulations, and thus availing themselves of a privilege secured to them\r\nby the treaty between Nicaragua and Great Britain of January 28, 1860.\r\n\r\nAfter this extension of uniform Nicaraguan administration to the\r\nMosquito Strip, the case of the British vice-consul, Hatch, and of\r\nseveral of his countrymen who had been summarily expelled from Nicaragua\r\nand treated with considerable indignity provoked a claim by Great\r\nBritain upon Nicaragua for pecuniary indemnity, which, upon Nicaragua's\r\nrefusal to admit liability, was enforced by Great Britain. While the\r\nsovereignty and jurisdiction of Nicaragua was in no way questioned by\r\nGreat Britain, the former's arbitrary conduct in regard to British\r\nsubjects furnished the ground for this proceeding.\r\n\r\nA British naval force occupied without resistance the Pacific seaport\r\nof Corinto, but was soon after withdrawn upon the promise that the sum\r\ndemanded would be paid. Throughout this incident the kindly offices of\r\nthe United States were invoked and were employed in favor of as peaceful\r\na settlement and as much consideration and indulgence toward Nicaragua\r\nas were consistent with the nature of the case. Our efforts have since\r\nbeen made the subject of appreciative and grateful recognition by\r\nNicaragua.\r\n\r\nThe coronation of the Czar of Russia at Moscow in May next invites the\r\nceremonial participation of the United States, and in accordance with\r\nusage and diplomatic propriety our minister to the imperial court has\r\nbeen directed to represent our Government on the occasion.\r\n\r\nCorrespondence is on foot touching the practice of Russian consuls\r\nwithin the jurisdiction of the United States to interrogate citizens as\r\nto their race and religious faith, and upon ascertainment thereof to\r\ndeny to Jews authentication of passports or legal documents for use in\r\nRussia. Inasmuch as such a proceeding imposes a disability which in the\r\ncase of succession to property in Russia may be found to infringe the\r\ntreaty rights of our citizens, and which is an obnoxious invasion of\r\nour territorial jurisdiction, it has elicited fitting remonstrance, the\r\nresult of which, it is hoped, will remove the cause of complaint. The\r\npending claims of sealing vessels of the United States seized in Russian\r\nwaters remain unadjusted. Our recent convention with Russia establishing\r\na _modus vivendi_ as to imperial jurisdiction in such cases has\r\nprevented further difficulty of this nature.\r\n\r\nThe Russian Government has welcomed in principle our suggestion for a\r\n_modus vivendi_, to embrace Great Britain and Japan, looking to the\r\nbetter preservation of seal life in the North Pacific and Bering Sea and\r\nthe extension of the protected area defined by the Paris Tribunal to all\r\nPacific waters north of the thirty-fifth parallel. It is especially\r\nnoticeable that Russia favors prohibition of the use of firearms in seal\r\nhunting throughout the proposed area and a longer closed season for\r\npelagic sealing.\r\n\r\nIn my last two annual messages I called the attention of the Congress\r\nto the position we occupied as one of the parties to a treaty or\r\nagreement by which we became jointly bound with England and Germany\r\nto so interfere with the government and control of Samoa as in effect\r\nto assume the management of its affairs.[23] On the 9th day of May, 1894,\r\nI transmitted to the Senate a special message,[24] with accompanying\r\ndocuments, giving information on the subject and emphasizing the opinion\r\nI have at all times entertained, that our situation in this matter was\r\ninconsistent with the mission and traditions of our Government, in\r\nviolation of the principles we profess, and in all its phases\r\nmischievous and vexatious.\r\n\r\nI again press this subject upon the attention of the Congress and ask\r\nfor such legislative action or expression as will lead the way to our\r\nrelief from obligations both irksome and unnatural.\r\n\r\nCuba is again gravely disturbed. An insurrection in some respects more\r\nactive than the last preceding revolt, which continued from 1868 to\r\n1878, now exists in a large part of the eastern interior of the island,\r\nmenacing even some populations on the coast. Besides deranging the\r\ncommercial exchanges of the island, of which our country takes the\r\npredominant share, this flagrant condition of hostilities, by arousing\r\nsentimental sympathy and inciting adventurous support among our people,\r\nhas entailed earnest effort on the part of this Government to enforce\r\nobedience to our neutrality laws and to prevent the territory of the\r\nUnited States from being abused as a vantage ground from which to aid\r\nthose in arms against Spanish sovereignty.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the traditional sympathy of our countrymen as\r\nindividuals with a people who seem to be struggling for larger autonomy\r\nand greater freedom, deepened, as such sympathy naturally must be, in\r\nbehalf of our neighbors, yet the plain duty of their Government is to\r\nobserve in good faith the recognized obligations of international\r\nrelationship. The performance of this duty should not be made more\r\ndifficult by a disregard on the part of our citizens of the obligations\r\ngrowing out of their allegiance to their country, which should restrain\r\nthem from violating as individuals the neutrality which the nation of\r\nwhich they are members is bound to observe in its relations to friendly\r\nsovereign states. Though neither the warmth of our people's sympathy\r\nwith the Cuban insurgents, nor our loss and material damage consequent\r\nupon the futile endeavors thus far made to restore peace and order, nor\r\nany shock our humane sensibilities may have received from the cruelties\r\nwhich appear to especially characterize this sanguinary and fiercely\r\nconducted war, have in the least shaken the determination of the\r\nGovernment to honestly fulfill every international obligation, yet it\r\nis to be earnestly hoped on every ground that the devastation of armed\r\nconflict may speedily be stayed and order and quiet restored to the\r\ndistracted island, bringing in their train the activity and thrift of\r\npeaceful pursuits.\r\n\r\nOne notable instance of interference by Spain with passing American\r\nships has occurred. On March 8 last the _Allianca_, while bound\r\nfrom Colon to New York, and following the customary track for vessels\r\nnear the Cuban shore, but outside the 3-mile limit, was fired upon by a\r\nSpanish gunboat. Protest was promptly made by the United States against\r\nthis act as not being justified by a state of war, nor permissible in\r\nrespect of vessels on the usual paths of commerce, nor tolerable in\r\nview of the wanton peril occasioned to innocent life and property.\r\nThe act was disavowed, with full expression of regret and assurance\r\nof nonrecurrence of such just cause of complaint, while the offending\r\nofficer was relieved of his command. Military arrests of citizens of the\r\nUnited States in Cuba have occasioned frequent reclamations. Where held\r\non criminal charges their delivery to the ordinary civil jurisdiction\r\nfor trial has been demanded and obtained in conformity with treaty\r\nprovisions, and where merely detained by way of military precaution\r\nunder a proclaimed state of siege, without formulated accusation, their\r\nrelease or trial has been insisted upon. The right of American consular\r\nofficers in the island to prefer protests and demands in such cases\r\nhaving been questioned by the insular authority, their enjoyment of the\r\nprivilege stipulated by treaty for the consuls of Germany was claimed\r\nunder the most-favored-nation provision of our own convention and was\r\npromptly recognized.\r\n\r\nThe long-standing demand of Antonio Maximo Mora against Spain has at\r\nlast been settled by the payment, on the 14th of September last, of the\r\nsum originally agreed upon in liquidation of the claim. Its distribution\r\namong the parties entitled to receive it has proceeded as rapidly as the\r\nrights of those claiming the fund could be safely determined.\r\n\r\nThe enforcement of differential duties against products of this country\r\nexported to Cuba and Puerto Rico prompted the immediate claim on our\r\npart to the benefit of the minimum tariff of Spain in return for the\r\nmost favorable treatment permitted by our laws as regards the production\r\nof Spanish territories. A commercial arrangement was concluded in\r\nJanuary last securing the treatment so claimed.\r\n\r\nVigorous protests against excessive fines imposed on our ships and\r\nmerchandise by the customs officers of these islands for trivial errors\r\nhave resulted in the remission of such fines in instances where the\r\nequity of the complaint was apparent, though the vexatious practice has\r\nnot been wholly discontinued.\r\n\r\nOccurrences in Turkey have continued to excite concern. The reported\r\nmassacres of Christians in Armenia and the development there and in\r\nother districts of a spirit of fanatic hostility to Christian influences\r\nnaturally excited apprehension for the safety of the devoted men and\r\nwomen who, as dependents of the foreign missionary societies in the\r\nUnited States, reside in Turkey under the guaranty of law and usage\r\nand in the legitimate performance of their educational and religious\r\nmission. No efforts have been spared in their behalf, and their\r\nprotection in person and property has been earnestly and vigorously\r\nenforced by every means within our power.\r\n\r\nI regret, however, that an attempt on our part to obtain better\r\ninformation concerning the true condition of affairs in the disturbed\r\nquarter of the Ottoman Empire by sending thither the United States\r\nconsul at Sivas to make investigation and report was thwarted by the\r\nobjections of the Turkish Government. This movement on our part was in\r\nno sense meant as a gratuitous entanglement of the United States in the\r\nso-called Eastern question nor as an officious interference with the\r\nright and duty which belong by treaty to certain great European powers\r\ncalling for their intervention in political matters affecting the good\r\ngovernment and religious freedom of the non-Mussulman subjects of the\r\nSultan, but it arose solely from our desire to have an accurate\r\nknowledge of the conditions in our efforts to care for those entitled\r\nto our protection.\r\n\r\nThe presence of our naval vessels which are now in the vicinity of the\r\ndisturbed localities affords opportunities to acquire a measure of\r\nfamiliarity with the condition of affairs and will enable us to take\r\nsuitable steps for the protection of any interests of our countrymen\r\nwithin reach of our ships that might be found imperiled.\r\n\r\nThe Ottoman Government has lately issued an imperial _irade_\r\nexempting forever from taxation an American college for girls at\r\nScutari. Repeated assurances have also been obtained by our envoy at\r\nConstantinople that similar institutions maintained and administered by\r\nour countrymen shall be secured in the enjoyment of all rights and that\r\nour citizens throughout the Empire shall be protected.\r\n\r\nThe Government, however, in view of existing facts, is far from relying\r\nupon such assurances as the limit of its duty. Our minister has been\r\nvigilant and alert in affording all possible protection in individual\r\ncases where danger threatened or safety was imperiled. We have sent\r\nships as far toward the points of actual disturbance as it is possible\r\nfor them to go, where they offer refuge to those obliged to flee, and we\r\nhave the promise of other powers which have ships in the neighborhood\r\nthat our citizens as well as theirs will be received and protected on\r\nboard those ships. On the demand of our minister orders have been issued\r\nby the Sultan that Turkish soldiers shall guard and escort to the coast\r\nAmerican refugees.\r\n\r\nThese orders have been carried out, and our latest intelligence\r\ngives assurance of the present personal safety of our citizens and\r\nmissionaries. Though thus far no lives of American citizens have been\r\nsacrificed, there can be no doubt that serious loss and destruction of\r\nmission property have resulted from riotous conflicts and outrageous\r\nattacks.\r\n\r\nBy treaty several of the most powerful European powers have secured a\r\nright and have assumed a duty not only in behalf of their own citizens\r\nand in furtherance of their own interests, but as agents of the\r\nChristian world. Their right is to enforce such conduct of Turkish\r\ngovernment as will restrain fanatical brutality, and if this fails their\r\nduty is to so interfere as to insure against such dreadful occurrences\r\nin Turkey as have lately shocked civilization. The powers declare this\r\nright and this duty to be theirs alone, and it is earnestly hoped that\r\nprompt and effective action on their part will not be delayed.\r\n\r\nThe new consulates at Erzerum and Harpoot, for which appropriation was\r\nmade last session, have been provisionally filled by trusted employees\r\nof the Department of State. These appointees, though now in Turkey, have\r\nnot yet received their exequaturs.\r\n\r\nThe arbitration of the claim of the Venezuela Steam Transportation\r\nCompany under the treaty of January 19, 1892, between the United States\r\nand Venezuela, resulted in an award in favor of the claimant.\r\n\r\nThe Government has used its good offices toward composing the\r\ndifferences between Venezuela on the one hand and France and Belgium on\r\nthe other growing out of the dismissal of the representatives of those\r\npowers on the ground of a publication deemed offensive to Venezuela.\r\nAlthough that dismissal was coupled with a cordial request that other\r\nmore personally agreeable envoys be sent in their stead, a rupture of\r\nintercourse ensued and still continues.\r\n\r\nIn view of the growth of our interests in foreign countries and the\r\nencouraging prospects for a general expansion of our commerce, the\r\nquestion of an improvement in the consular service has increased in\r\nimportance and urgency. Though there is no doubt that the great body\r\nof consular officers are rendering valuable services to the trade and\r\nindustries of the country, the need of some plan of appointment and\r\ncontrol which would tend to secure a higher average of efficiency can\r\nnot be denied.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the subject has led the Executive to consider what\r\nsteps might properly be taken without additional legislation to answer\r\nthe need of a better system of consular appointments. The matter having\r\nbeen committed to the consideration of the Secretary of State, in\r\npursuance of his recommendations an Executive order was issued on the\r\n20th of September, 1895,[25] by the terms of which it is provided that\r\nafter that date any vacancy in a consulate or commercial agency with an\r\nannual salary or compensation from official fees of not more than $2,500\r\nor less than $1,000 should be filled either by transfer or promotion\r\nfrom some other position under the Department of State of a character\r\ntending to qualify the incumbent for the position to be filled, or by\r\nthe appointment of a person not under the Department of State, but\r\nhaving previously served thereunder and shown his capacity and fitness\r\nfor consular duty, or by the appointment of a person who, having been\r\nselected by the President and sent to a board for examination, is found\r\nupon such examination to be qualified for the position. Posts which pay\r\nless than $1,000 being usually, on account of their small compensation,\r\nfilled by selection from residents of the locality, it was not deemed\r\npracticable to put them under the new system.\r\n\r\nThe compensation of $2,500 was adopted as the maximum limit in the\r\nclassification for the reason that consular officers receiving more than\r\nthat sum are often charged with functions and duties scarcely inferior\r\nin dignity and importance to those of diplomatic agents, and it was\r\ntherefore thought best to continue their selection in the discretion of\r\nthe Executive without subjecting them to examination before a board.\r\nExcluding 71 places with compensation at present less than $1,000 and\r\n53 places above the maximum in compensation, the number of positions\r\nremaining within the scope of the order is 196. This number will\r\nundoubtedly be increased by the inclusion of consular officers whose\r\nremuneration in fees, now less than $1,000, will be augmented with the\r\ngrowth of our foreign commerce and a return to more favorable business\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nIn execution of the Executive order referred to the Secretary of State\r\nhas designated as a board to conduct the prescribed examinations the\r\nThird Assistant Secretary of State, the Solicitor of the Department\r\nof State, and the Chief of the Consular Bureau, and has specified the\r\nsubjects to which such examinations shall relate.\r\n\r\nIt is not assumed that this system will prove a full measure of\r\nconsular reform. It is quite probable that actual experience will\r\nshow particulars in which the order already issued may be amended\r\nand demonstrate that for the best results appropriate legislation\r\nby Congress is imperatively required.\r\n\r\nIn any event, these efforts to improve the consular service\r\nought to be immediately supplemented by legislation providing for\r\nconsular inspection. This has frequently been a subject of Executive\r\nrecommendation, and I again urge such action by Congress as will permit\r\nthe frequent and thorough inspection of consulates by officers appointed\r\nfor that purpose or by persons already in the diplomatic or consular\r\nservice. The expense attending such a plan would be insignificant\r\ncompared with its usefulness, and I hope the legislation necessary\r\nto set it on foot will be speedily forthcoming.\r\n\r\nI am thoroughly convinced that in addition to their salaries our\r\nambassadors and ministers at foreign courts should be provided by the\r\nGovernment with official residences. The salaries of these officers are\r\ncomparatively small and in most cases insufficient to pay, with other\r\nnecessary expenses, the cost of maintaining household establishments in\r\nkeeping with their important and delicate functions. The usefulness of\r\na nation's diplomatic representative undeniably depends much upon the\r\nappropriateness of his surroundings, and a country like ours, while\r\navoiding unnecessary glitter and show, should be certain that it does\r\nnot suffer in its relations with foreign nations through parsimony and\r\nshabbiness in its diplomatic outfit. These considerations and the other\r\nadvantages of having fixed and somewhat permanent locations for our\r\nembassies would abundantly justify the moderate expenditure necessary\r\nto carry out this suggestion.\r\n\r\nAs we turn from a review of our foreign relations to the contemplation\r\nof our national financial situation we are immediately aware that we\r\napproach a subject of domestic concern more important than any other\r\nthat can engage our attention, and one at present in such a perplexing\r\nand delicate predicament as to require prompt and wise treatment.\r\n\r\nWe may well be encouraged to earnest effort in this direction when\r\nwe recall the steps already taken toward improving our economic and\r\nfinancial situation and when we appreciate how well the way has been\r\nprepared for further progress by an aroused and intelligent popular\r\ninterest in these subjects.\r\n\r\nBy command of the people a customs-revenue system designed for the\r\nprotection and benefit of favored classes at the expense of the great\r\nmass of our countrymen, and which, while inefficient for the purpose\r\nof revenue, curtailed our trade relations and impeded our entrance to\r\nthe markets of the world, has been superseded by a tariff policy which\r\nin principle is based upon a denial of the right of the Government\r\nto obstruct the avenues to our people's cheap living or lessen their\r\ncomfort and contentment for the sake of according especial advantages to\r\nfavorites, and which, while encouraging our intercourse and trade with\r\nother nations, recognizes the fact that American self-reliance, thrift,\r\nand ingenuity can build up our country's industries and develop its\r\nresources more surely than enervating paternalism.\r\n\r\nThe compulsory purchase and coinage of silver by the Government,\r\nunchecked and unregulated by business conditions and heedless of\r\nour currency needs, which for more than fifteen years diluted our\r\ncirculating medium, undermined confidence abroad in our financial\r\nability, and at last culminated in distress and panic at home, has been\r\nrecently stopped by the repeal of the laws which forced this reckless\r\nscheme upon the country.\r\n\r\nThe things thus accomplished, notwithstanding their extreme importance\r\nand beneficent effects, fall far short of curing the monetary evils from\r\nwhich we suffer as a result of long indulgence in ill-advised financial\r\nexpedients.\r\n\r\nThe currency denominated United States notes and commonly known as\r\ngreenbacks was issued in large volume during the late Civil War and was\r\nintended originally to meet the exigencies of that period. It will be\r\nseen by a reference to the debates in Congress at the time the laws\r\nwere passed authorizing the issue of these notes that their advocates\r\ndeclared they were intended for only temporary use and to meet the\r\nemergency of war. In almost if not all the laws relating to them\r\nsome provision was made contemplating their voluntary or compulsory\r\nretirement. A large quantity of them, however, were kept on foot and\r\nmingled with the currency of the country, so that at the close of the\r\nyear 1874 they amounted to $381,999,073.\r\n\r\nImmediately after that date, and in January, 1875, a law was passed\r\nproviding for the resumption of specie payments, by which the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury was required whenever additional circulation was issued\r\nto national banks to retire United States notes equal in amount to 80\r\nper cent of such additional national-bank circulation until such notes\r\nwere reduced to $300,000,000. This law further provided that on and\r\nafter the 1st day of January, 1879, the United States notes then\r\noutstanding should be redeemed in coin, and in order to provide and\r\nprepare for such redemption the Secretary of the Treasury was authorized\r\nnot only to use any surplus revenues of the Government, but to issue\r\nbonds of the United States and dispose of them for coin and to use the\r\nproceeds for the purposes contemplated by the statute.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1878, and before the date thus appointed for the redemption\r\nand retirement of these notes, another statute was passed forbidding\r\ntheir further cancellation and retirement. Some of them had, however,\r\nbeen previously redeemed and canceled upon the issue of additional\r\nnational-bank circulation, as permitted by the law of 1875, so that the\r\namount outstanding at the time of the passage of the act forbidding\r\ntheir further retirement was $346,681,016.\r\n\r\nThe law of 1878 did not stop at distinct prohibition, but contained in\r\naddition the following express provision:\r\n\r\n  And when any of said notes may be redeemed or be received into the\r\n  Treasury under any law from any source whatever, and shall belong to\r\n  the United States, they shall not be retired, canceled, or destroyed,\r\n  but they shall be reissued and paid out again and kept in circulation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was the condition of affairs on the 1st day of January, 1879, which\r\nhad been fixed upon four years before as the date for entering upon the\r\nredemption and retirement of all these notes, and for which such\r\nabundant means had been provided.\r\n\r\nThe Government was put in the anomalous situation of owing to the\r\nholders of its notes debts payable in gold on demand which could neither\r\nbe retired by receiving such notes in discharge of obligations due the\r\nGovernment nor canceled by actual payment in gold. It was forced to\r\nredeem without redemption and to pay without acquittance.\r\n\r\nThere had been issued and sold $95,500,000 of the bonds authorized by\r\nthe resumption act of 1875, the proceeds of which, together with other\r\ngold in the Treasury, created a gold fund deemed sufficient to meet\r\nthe demands which might be made upon it for the redemption of the\r\noutstanding United States notes. This fund, together with such other\r\ngold as might be from time to time in the Treasury available for the\r\nsame purpose, has been since called our gold reserve, and $100,000,000\r\nhas been regarded as an adequate amount to accomplish its object. This\r\nfund amounted on the 1st day of January, 1879, to $114,193,360, and\r\nthough thereafter constantly fluctuating it did not fall below that\r\nsum until July, 1892. In April, 1893, for the first time since its\r\nestablishment, this reserve amounted to less than $100,000,000,\r\ncontaining at that date only $97,011,330.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, and in July, 1890, an act had been passed directing\r\nlarger governmental monthly purchases of silver than had been required\r\nunder previous laws, and providing that in payment for such silver\r\nTreasury notes of the United States should be issued payable on demand\r\nin gold or silver coin, at the discretion of the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury. It was, however, declared in the act to be \"the established\r\npolicy of the United States to maintain the two metals on a parity with\r\neach other upon the present legal ratio or such ratio as may be provided\r\nby law.\" In view of this declaration it was not deemed permissible for\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury to exercise the discretion in terms\r\nconferred on him by refusing to pay gold on these notes when demanded,\r\nbecause by such discrimination in favor of the gold dollar the so-called\r\nparity of the two metals would be destroyed and grave and dangerous\r\nconsequences would be precipitated by affirming or accentuating the\r\nconstantly widening disparity between their actual values under the\r\nexisting ratio.\r\n\r\nIt thus resulted that the Treasury notes issued in payment of silver\r\npurchases under the law of 1890 were necessarily treated as gold\r\nobligations at the option of the holder. These notes on the 1st day of\r\nNovember, 1893, when the law compelling the monthly purchase of silver\r\nwas repealed, amounted to more than $155,000,000. The notes of this\r\ndescription now outstanding added to the United States notes still\r\nundiminished by redemption or cancellation constitute a volume of gold\r\nobligations amounting to nearly $500,000,000.\r\n\r\nThese obligations are the instruments which ever since we had a gold\r\nreserve have been used to deplete it.\r\n\r\nThis reserve, as has been stated, had fallen in April, 1893, to\r\n$97,011,330. It has from that time to the present, with very few and\r\nunimportant upward movements, steadily decreased, except as it has been\r\ntemporarily replenished by the sale of bonds.\r\n\r\nAmong the causes for this constant and uniform shrinkage in this fund\r\nmay be mentioned the great falling off of exports under the operation of\r\nthe tariff law until recently in force, which crippled our exchange of\r\ncommodities with foreign nations and necessitated to some extent the\r\npayment of our balances in gold; the unnatural infusion of silver into\r\nour currency and the increasing agitation for its free and unlimited\r\ncoinage, which have created apprehension as to our disposition or\r\nability to continue gold payments; the consequent hoarding of gold at\r\nhome and the stoppage of investments of foreign capital, as well as\r\nthe return of our securities already sold abroad; and the high rate of\r\nforeign exchange, which induced the shipment of our gold to be drawn\r\nagainst as a matter of speculation.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of these conditions the gold reserve on the 1st day\r\nof February, 1894, was reduced to $65,438,377, having lost more than\r\n$31,000,000 during the preceding nine months, or since April, 1893. Its\r\nreplenishment being necessary and no other manner of accomplishing it\r\nbeing possible, resort was had to the issue and sale of bonds provided\r\nfor by the resumption act of 1875. Fifty millions of these bonds were\r\nsold, yielding $58,633,295.71, which was added to the reserve fund of\r\ngold then on hand. As a result of this operation this reserve, which had\r\nsuffered constant and large withdrawals in the meantime, stood on the\r\n6th day of March, 1894, at the sum of $107,446,802. Its depletion was,\r\nhowever, immediately thereafter so accelerated that on the 30th day of\r\nJune, 1894, it had fallen to $64,873,025, thus losing by withdrawals\r\nmore than $42,000,000 in five months and dropping slightly below its\r\nsituation when the sale of $50,000,000 in bonds was effected for its\r\nreplenishment.\r\n\r\nThis depressed condition grew worse, and on the 24th day of November,\r\n1894, our gold reserve being reduced to $57,669,701, it became necessary\r\nto again strengthen it.\r\n\r\nThis was done by another sale of bonds amounting to $50,000,000, from\r\nwhich there was realized $58,538,500, with which the fund was increased\r\nto $111,142,021 on the 4th day of December, 1894.\r\n\r\nAgain disappointment awaited the anxious hope for relief. There was not\r\neven a lull in the exasperating withdrawals of gold. On the contrary,\r\nthey grew larger and more persistent than ever. Between the 4th day of\r\nDecember, 1894, and early in February, 1895, a period of scarcely more\r\nthan two months after the second reenforcement of our gold reserve by\r\nthe sale of bonds, it had lost by such withdrawals more than $69,000,000\r\nand had fallen to $41,340,181. Nearly $43,000,000 had been withdrawn\r\nwithin the month immediately preceding this situation.\r\n\r\nIn anticipation of impending trouble I had on the 28th day of January,\r\n1895, addressed a communication[26] to the Congress fully setting forth\r\nour difficulties and dangerous position and earnestly recommending that\r\nauthority be given the Secretary of the Treasury to issue bonds bearing\r\na low rate of interest, payable by their terms in gold, for the purpose\r\nof maintaining a sufficient gold reserve and also for the redemption and\r\ncancellation of outstanding United States notes and the Treasury notes\r\nissued for the purchase of silver under the law of 1890. This\r\nrecommendation did not, however, meet with legislative approval.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1895, therefore, the situation was exceedingly critical.\r\nWith a reserve perilously low and a refusal of Congressional aid,\r\neverything indicated that the end of gold payments by the Government\r\nwas imminent. The results of prior bond issues had been exceedingly\r\nunsatisfactory, and the large withdrawals of gold immediately succeeding\r\ntheir public sale in open market gave rise to a reasonable suspicion\r\nthat a large part of the gold paid into the Treasury upon such sales was\r\npromptly drawn out again by the presentation of United States notes or\r\nTreasury notes, and found its way to the hands of those who had only\r\ntemporarily parted with it in the purchase of bonds.\r\n\r\nIn this emergency, and in view of its surrounding perplexities, it\r\nbecame entirely apparent to those upon whom the struggle for safety was\r\ndevolved not only that our gold reserve must, for the third time in less\r\nthan thirteen months, be restored by another issue and sale of bonds\r\nbearing a high rate of interest and badly suited to the purpose, but\r\nthat a plan must be adopted for their disposition promising better\r\nresults than those realized on previous sales. An agreement was\r\ntherefore made with a number of financiers and bankers whereby it was\r\nstipulated that bonds described in the resumption act of 1875, payable\r\nin coin thirty years after their date, bearing interest at the rate of\r\n4 per cent per annum, and amounting to about $62,000,000, should be\r\nexchanged for gold, receivable by weight, amounting to a little more\r\nthan $65,000,000.\r\n\r\nThis gold was to be delivered in such installments as would complete\r\nits delivery within about six months from the date of the contract, and\r\nat least one-half of the amount was to be furnished from abroad. It was\r\nalso agreed by those supplying this gold that during the continuance\r\nof the contract they would by every means in their power protect the\r\nGovernment against gold withdrawals. The contract also provided that\r\nif Congress would authorize their issue bonds payable by their terms\r\nin gold and bearing interest at the rate of 3 per cent per annum might\r\nwithin ten days be substituted at par for the 4 per cent bonds described\r\nin the agreement.\r\n\r\nOn the day this contract was made its terms were communicated to\r\nCongress by a special Executive message,[27] in which it was stated that\r\nmore than $16,000,000 would be saved to the Government if gold bonds\r\nbearing 3 per cent interest were authorized to be substituted for those\r\nmentioned in the contract.\r\n\r\nThe Congress having declined to grant the necessary authority to secure\r\nthis saving, the contract, unmodified, was carried out, resulting in a\r\ngold reserve amounting to $107,571,230 on the 8th day of July, 1895.\r\nThe performance of this contract not only restored the reserve, but\r\nchecked for a time the withdrawals of gold and brought on a period of\r\nrestored confidence and such peace and quiet in business circles as\r\nwere of the greatest possible value to every interest that affects our\r\npeople. I have never had the slightest misgiving concerning the wisdom\r\nor propriety of this arrangement, and am quite willing to answer for\r\nmy full share of responsibility for its promotion. I believe it averted\r\na disaster the imminence of which was, fortunately, not at the time\r\ngenerally understood by our people.\r\n\r\nThough the contract mentioned stayed for a time the tide of gold\r\nwithdrawal, its good results could not be permanent. Recent withdrawals\r\nhave reduced the reserve from $107,571,230 on the 8th day of July, 1895,\r\nto $79,333,966. How long it will remain large enough to render its\r\nincrease unnecessary is only matter of conjecture, though quite large\r\nwithdrawals for shipment in the immediate future are predicted in\r\nwell-informed quarters. About $16,000,000 has been withdrawn during the\r\nmonth of November.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing statement of events and conditions develops the fact that\r\nafter increasing our interest-bearing bonded indebtedness more than\r\n$162,000,000 to save our gold reserve we are nearly where we started,\r\nhaving now in such reserve $79,333,966, as against $65,438,377 in\r\nFebruary, 1894, when the first bonds were issued.\r\n\r\nThough the amount of gold drawn from the Treasury appears to be very\r\nlarge as gathered from the facts and figures herein presented, it\r\nactually was much larger, considerable sums having been acquired by the\r\nTreasury within the several periods stated without the issue of bonds.\r\nOn the 28th of January, 1895, it was reported by the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury that more than $172,000,000 of gold had been withdrawn for\r\nhoarding or shipment during the year preceding. He now reports that from\r\nJanuary 1, 1879, to July 14, 1890, a period of more than eleven years,\r\nonly a little over $28,000,000 was withdrawn, and that between July 14,\r\n1890, the date of the passage of the law for an increased purchase of\r\nsilver, and the 1st day of December, 1895, or within less than five and\r\na half years, there was withdrawn nearly $375,000,000, making a total of\r\nmore than $403,000,000 drawn from the Treasury in gold since January 1,\r\n1879, the date fixed in 1875 for the retirement of the United States\r\nnotes.\r\n\r\nNearly $327,000,000 of the gold thus withdrawn has been paid out on\r\nthese United States notes, and yet every one of the $346,000,000 is\r\nstill uncanceled and ready to do service in future gold depletions.\r\n\r\nMore than $76,000,000 in gold has since their creation in 1890 been paid\r\nout from the Treasury upon the notes given on the purchase of silver by\r\nthe Government, and yet the whole, amounting to $155,000,000, except a\r\nlittle more than $16,000,000 which has been retired by exchanges for\r\nsilver at the request of the holders, remains outstanding and prepared\r\nto join their older and more experienced allies in future raids upon the\r\nTreasury's gold reserve.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the Government has paid in gold more than nine-tenths\r\nof its United States notes and still owes them all. It has paid in\r\ngold about one-half of its notes given for silver purchases without\r\nextinguishing by such payment one dollar of these notes.\r\n\r\nWhen, added to all this, we are reminded that to carry on this\r\nastounding financial scheme the Government has incurred a bonded\r\nindebtedness of $95,500,000 in establishing a gold reserve and of\r\n$162,315,400 in efforts to maintain it; that the annual interest charge\r\non such bonded indebtedness is more than $11,000,000; that a continuance\r\nof our present course may result in further bond issues, and that we\r\nhave suffered or are threatened with all this for the sake of supplying\r\ngold for foreign shipment or facilitating its hoarding at home, a\r\nsituation is exhibited which certainly ought to arrest attention and\r\nprovoke immediate legislative relief.\r\n\r\nI am convinced the only thorough and practicable remedy for our troubles\r\nis found in the retirement and cancellation of our United States notes,\r\ncommonly called greenbacks, and the outstanding Treasury notes issued by\r\nthe Government in payment of silver purchases under the act of 1890.\r\n\r\nI believe this could be quite readily accomplished by the exchange\r\nof these notes for United States bonds, of small as well as large\r\ndenominations, bearing a low rate of interest. They should be long-term\r\nbonds, thus increasing their desirability as investments, and because\r\ntheir payment could be well postponed to a period far removed from\r\npresent financial burdens and perplexities, when with increased\r\nprosperity and resources they would be more easily met.\r\n\r\nTo further insure the cancellation of these notes and also provide a way\r\nby which gold may be added to our currency in lieu of them, a feature in\r\nthe plan should be an authority given to the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nto dispose of the bonds abroad for gold if necessary to complete the\r\ncontemplated redemption and cancellation, permitting him to use the\r\nproceeds of such bonds to take up and cancel any of the notes that may\r\nbe in the Treasury or that may be received by the Government on any\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nThe increase of our bonded debt involved in this plan would be amply\r\ncompensated by renewed activity and enterprise in all business circles,\r\nthe restored confidence at home, the reinstated faith in our monetary\r\nstrength abroad, and the stimulation of every interest and industry\r\nthat would follow the cancellation of the gold-demand obligations now\r\nafflicting us. In any event, the bonds proposed would stand for the\r\nextinguishment of a troublesome indebtedness, while in the path we now\r\nfollow there lurks the menace of unending bonds, with our indebtedness\r\nstill undischarged and aggravated in every feature. The obligations\r\nnecessary to fund this indebtedness would not equal in amount those\r\nfrom which we have been relieved since 1884 by anticipation and payment\r\nbeyond the requirements of the sinking fund out of our surplus revenues.\r\n\r\nThe currency withdrawn by the retirement of the United States notes and\r\nTreasury notes, amounting to probably less than $486,000,000, might be\r\nsupplied by such gold as would be used on their retirement or by an\r\nincrease in the circulation of our national banks. Though the aggregate\r\ncapital of those now in existence amounts to more than $664,000,000,\r\ntheir outstanding circulation based on bond security amounts to only\r\nabout $190,000,000. They are authorized to issue notes amounting to 90\r\nper cent of the bonds deposited to secure their circulation, but in no\r\nevent beyond the amount of their capital stock, and they are obliged to\r\npay 1 per cent tax on the circulation they issue.\r\n\r\nI think they should be allowed to issue circulation equal to the par\r\nvalue of the bonds they deposit to secure it, and that the tax on their\r\ncirculation should be reduced to one-fourth of 1 per cent, which would\r\nundoubtedly meet all the expense the Government incurs on their account.\r\nIn addition they should be allowed to substitute or deposit in lieu of\r\nthe bonds now required as security for their circulation those which\r\nwould be issued for the purpose of retiring the United States notes and\r\nTreasury notes.\r\n\r\nThe banks already existing, if they desired to avail themselves of the\r\nprovisions of law thus modified, could issue circulation, in addition to\r\nthat already outstanding, amounting to $478,000,000, which would nearly\r\nor quite equal the currency proposed to be canceled. At any rate, I\r\nshould confidently expect to see the existing national banks or others\r\nto be organized avail themselves of the proposed encouragements to issue\r\ncirculation and promptly fill any vacuum and supply every currency need.\r\n\r\nIt has always seemed to me that the provisions of law regarding the\r\ncapital of national banks, which operate as a limitation to their\r\nlocation, fail to make proper compensation for the suppression of State\r\nbanks, which came near to the people in all sections of the country and\r\nreadily furnished them with banking accommodations and facilities. Any\r\ninconvenience or embarrassment arising from these restrictions on the\r\nlocation of national banks might well be remedied by better adapting\r\nthe present system to the creation of banks in smaller communities or\r\nby permitting banks of large capital to establish branches in such\r\nlocalities as would serve the people, so regulated and restrained as\r\nto secure their safe and conservative control and management.\r\n\r\nBut there might not be the necessity for such an addition to the\r\ncurrency by new issues of bank circulation as at first glance is\r\nindicated. If we should be relieved from maintaining a gold reserve\r\nunder conditions that constitute it the barometer of our solvency, and\r\nif our Treasury should no longer be the foolish purveyor of gold for\r\nnations abroad or for speculation and hoarding by our citizens at home,\r\nI should expect to see gold resume its natural and normal functions in\r\nthe business affairs of the country and cease to be an object attracting\r\nthe timid watch of our people and exciting their sensitive imaginations.\r\n\r\nI do not overlook the fact that the cancellation of the Treasury notes\r\nissued under the silver-purchasing act of 1890 would leave the Treasury\r\nin the actual ownership of sufficient silver, including seigniorage,\r\nto coin nearly $178,000,000 in standard dollars. It is worthy of\r\nconsideration whether this might not from time to time be converted into\r\ndollars or fractional coin and slowly put into circulation, as in the\r\njudgment of the Secretary of the Treasury the necessities of the country\r\nshould require.\r\n\r\nWhatever is attempted should be entered upon fully appreciating the fact\r\nthat by careless, easy descent we have reached a dangerous depth, and\r\nthat our ascent will not be accomplished without laborious toil and\r\nstruggle. We shall be wise if we realize that we are financially ill and\r\nthat our restoration to health may require heroic treatment and\r\nunpleasant remedies.\r\n\r\nIn the present stage of our difficulty it is not easy to understand how\r\nthe amount of our revenue receipts directly affects it. The important\r\nquestion is not the quantity of money received in revenue payments, but\r\nthe kind of money we maintain and our ability to continue in sound\r\nfinancial condition. We are considering the Government's holdings of\r\ngold as related to the soundness of our money and as affecting our\r\nnational credit and monetary strength.\r\n\r\nIf our gold reserve had never been impaired; if no bonds had ever\r\nbeen issued to replenish it; if there had been no fear and timidity\r\nconcerning our ability to continue gold payments; if any part of our\r\nrevenues were now paid in gold, and if we could look to our gold\r\nreceipts as a means of maintaining a safe reserve, the amount of\r\nour revenues would be an influential factor in the problem. But,\r\nunfortunately, all the circumstances that might lend weight to this\r\nconsideration are entirely lacking.\r\n\r\nIn our present predicament no gold is received by the Government\r\nin payment of revenue charges, nor would there be if the revenues\r\nwere increased. The receipts of the Treasury, when not in silver\r\ncertificates, consist of United States notes and Treasury notes issued\r\nfor silver purchases. These forms of money are only useful to the\r\nGovernment in paying its current ordinary expenses, and its quantity in\r\nGovernment possession does not in the least contribute toward giving us\r\nthat kind of safe financial standing or condition which is built on gold\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nIf it is said that these notes if held by the Government can be used to\r\nobtain gold for our reserve, the answer is easy. The people draw gold\r\nfrom the Treasury on demand upon United States notes and Treasury notes,\r\nbut the proposition that the Treasury can on demand draw gold from the\r\npeople upon them would be regarded in these days with wonder and\r\namusement; and even if this could be done there is nothing to prevent\r\nthose thus parting with their gold from regaining it the next day or the\r\nnext hour by the presentation of the notes they received in exchange for\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Treasury might use such notes taken from a\r\nsurplus revenue to buy gold in the market. Of course he could not do\r\nthis without paying a premium. Private holders of gold, unlike the\r\nGovernment, having no parity to maintain, would not be restrained\r\nfrom making the best bargain possible when they furnished gold to the\r\nTreasury; but the moment the Secretary of the Treasury bought gold on\r\nany terms above par he would establish a general and universal premium\r\nupon it, thus breaking down the parity between gold and silver, which\r\nthe Government is pledged to maintain, and opening the way to new and\r\nserious complications. In the meantime the premium would not remain\r\nstationary, and the absurd spectacle might be presented of a dealer\r\nselling gold to the Government and with United States notes or Treasury\r\nnotes in his hand immediately clamoring for its return and a resale at\r\na higher premium.\r\n\r\nIt may be claimed that a large revenue and redundant receipts might\r\nfavorably affect the situation under discussion by affording an\r\nopportunity of retaining these notes in the Treasury when received, and\r\nthus preventing their presentation for gold. Such retention to be useful\r\nought to be at least measurably permanent; and this is precisely what is\r\nprohibited, so far as United States notes are concerned, by the law of\r\n1878, forbidding their further retirement. That statute in so many words\r\nprovides that these notes when received into the Treasury and belonging\r\nto the United States shall be \"paid out again and kept in circulation.\"\r\n\r\nIt will, moreover, be readily seen that the Government could not\r\nrefuse to pay out United States notes and Treasury notes in current\r\ntransactions when demanded, and insist on paying out silver alone,\r\nand still maintain the parity between that metal and the currency\r\nrepresenting gold. Besides, the accumulation in the Treasury of currency\r\nof any kind exacted from the people through taxation is justly regarded\r\nas an evil, and it can not proceed far without vigorous protest against\r\nan unjustifiable retention of money from the business of the country and\r\na denunciation of a scheme of taxation which proves itself to be unjust\r\nwhen it takes from the earnings and income of the citizen money so much\r\nin excess of the needs of Government support that large sums can be\r\ngathered and kept in the Treasury. Such a condition has heretofore in\r\ntimes of surplus revenue led the Government to restore currency to the\r\npeople by the purchase of its unmatured bonds at a large premium and\r\nby a large increase of its deposits in national banks, and we easily\r\nremember that the abuse of Treasury accumulation has furnished a most\r\npersuasive argument in favor of legislation radically reducing our\r\ntariff taxation.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is supposed that sufficient revenue receipts would in a\r\nsentimental way improve the situation by inspiring confidence in our\r\nsolvency and allaying the fear of pecuniary exhaustion. And yet through\r\nall our struggles to maintain our gold reserve there never has been any\r\napprehension as to our ready ability to pay our way with such money as\r\nwe had, and the question whether or not our current receipts met our\r\ncurrent expenses has not entered into the estimate of our solvency. Of\r\ncourse the general state of our funds, exclusive of gold, was entirely\r\nimmaterial to the foreign creditor and investor. His debt could only be\r\npaid in gold, and his only concern was our ability to keep on hand that\r\nkind of money.\r\n\r\nOn July 1, 1892, more than a year and a half before the first bonds\r\nwere issued to replenish the gold reserve, there was a net balance in\r\nthe Treasury, exclusive of such reserve, of less than $13,000,000, but\r\nthe gold reserve amounted to more than $114,000,000, which was the\r\nquieting feature of the situation. It was when the stock of gold began\r\nrapidly to fall that fright supervened and our securities held abroad\r\nwere returned for sale and debts owed abroad were pressed for payment.\r\nIn the meantime extensive shipments of gold and other unfavorable\r\nindications caused restlessness and fright among our people at home.\r\nThereupon the general state of our funds, exclusive of gold, became\r\nalso immaterial to them, and they too drew gold from the Treasury for\r\nhoarding against all contingencies. This is plainly shown by the large\r\nincrease in the proportion of gold withdrawn which was retained by\r\nour own people as time and threatening incidents progressed. During\r\nthe fiscal year ending June 30, 1894, nearly $85,000,000 in gold was\r\nwithdrawn from the Treasury and about $77,000,000 was sent abroad, while\r\nduring the fiscal year ending June 30, 1895, over $117,000,000 was drawn\r\nout, of which only about $66,000,000 was shipped, leaving the large\r\nbalance of such withdrawals to be accounted for by domestic hoarding.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the withdrawal of our gold has resulted largely from\r\nfright, there is nothing apparent that will prevent its continuance or\r\nrecurrence, with its natural consequences, except such a change in our\r\nfinancial methods as will reassure the frightened and make the desire\r\nfor gold less intense. It is not clear how an increase in revenue,\r\nunless it be in gold, can satisfy those whose only anxiety is to gain\r\ngold from the Government's store.\r\n\r\nIt can not, therefore, be safe to rely upon increased revenues as a cure\r\nfor our present troubles.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that the suggestion of increased revenue as a remedy for\r\nthe difficulties we are considering may have originated in an intimation\r\nor distinct allegation that the bonds which have been issued ostensibly\r\nto replenish our gold reserve were really issued to supply insufficient\r\nrevenue. Nothing can be further from the truth. Bonds were issued to\r\nobtain gold for the maintenance of our national credit. As has been\r\nshown, the gold thus obtained has been drawn again from the Treasury\r\nupon United States notes and Treasury notes. This operation would have\r\nbeen promptly prevented if possible; but these notes having thus been\r\npassed to the Treasury, they became the money of the Government, like\r\nany other ordinary Government funds, and there was nothing to do but to\r\nuse them in paying Government expenses when needed.\r\n\r\nAt no time when bonds have been issued has there been any consideration\r\nof the question of paying the expenses of Government with their\r\nproceeds. There was no necessity to consider that question. At the time\r\nof each bond issue we had a safe surplus in the Treasury for ordinary\r\noperations, exclusive of the gold in our reserve. In February, 1894,\r\nwhen the first issue of bonds was made, such surplus amounted to over\r\n$18,000,000; in November, when the second issue was made, it amounted to\r\nmore than $42,000,000, and in February, 1895, when bonds for the third\r\ntime were issued, such surplus amounted to more than $100,000,000. It\r\nnow amounts to $98,072,420.30.\r\n\r\nBesides all this, the Secretary of the Treasury had no authority\r\nwhatever to issue bonds to increase the ordinary revenues or pay current\r\nexpenses.\r\n\r\nI can not but think there has been some confusion of ideas regarding the\r\neffects of the issue of bonds and the results of the withdrawal of gold.\r\nIt was the latter process, and not the former, that, by substituting in\r\nthe Treasury United States notes and Treasury notes for gold, increased\r\nby their amount the money which was in the first instance subject to\r\nordinary Government expenditure.\r\n\r\nAlthough the law compelling an increased purchase of silver by the\r\nGovernment was passed on the 14th day of July, 1890, withdrawals of gold\r\nfrom the Treasury upon the notes given in payment on such purchases\r\ndid not begin until October, 1891. Immediately following that date the\r\nwithdrawals upon both these notes and United States notes increased\r\nvery largely, and have continued to such an extent that since the\r\npassage of that law there has been more than thirteen times as much gold\r\ntaken out of the Treasury upon United States notes and Treasury notes\r\nissued for silver purchases as was thus withdrawn during the eleven and\r\na half years immediately prior thereto and after the 1st day of January,\r\n1879, when specie payments were resumed.\r\n\r\nIt is neither unfair nor unjust to charge a large share of our present\r\nfinancial perplexities and dangers to the operation of the laws of 1878\r\nand 1890 compelling the purchase of silver by the Government, which not\r\nonly furnished a new Treasury obligation upon which its gold could be\r\nwithdrawn, but so increased the fear of an overwhelming flood of silver\r\nand a forced descent to silver payments that even the repeal of these\r\nlaws did not entirely cure the evils of their existence.\r\n\r\nWhile I have endeavored to make a plain statement of the disordered\r\ncondition of our currency and the present dangers menacing our\r\nprosperity and to suggest a way which leads to a safer financial system,\r\nI have constantly had in mind the fact that many of my countrymen, whose\r\nsincerity I do not doubt, insist that the cure for the ills now\r\nthreatening us may be found in the single and simple remedy of the free\r\ncoinage of silver. They contend that our mints shall be at once thrown\r\nopen to the free, unlimited, and independent coinage of both gold and\r\nsilver dollars of full legal-tender quality, regardless of the action of\r\nany other government and in full view of the fact that the ratio between\r\nthe metals which they suggest calls for 100 cents' worth of gold in the\r\ngold dollar at the present standard and only 50 cents in intrinsic worth\r\nof silver in the silver dollar.\r\n\r\nWere there infinitely stronger reasons than can be adduced for hoping\r\nthat such action would secure for us a bimetallic currency moving on\r\nlines of parity, an experiment so novel and hazardous as that proposed\r\nmight well stagger those who believe that stability is an imperative\r\ncondition of sound money.\r\n\r\nNo government, no human contrivance or act of legislation, has ever\r\nbeen able to hold the two metals together in free coinage at a ratio\r\nappreciably different from that which is established in the markets of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nThose who believe that our independent free coinage of silver at an\r\nartificial ratio with gold of 16 to 1 would restore the parity between\r\nthe metals, and consequently between the coins, oppose an unsupported\r\nand improbable theory to the general belief and practice of other\r\nnations and to the teaching of the wisest statesmen and economists\r\nof the world, both in the past and present, and, what is far more\r\nconclusive, they run counter to our own actual experiences.\r\n\r\nTwice in our earlier history our lawmakers, in attempting to establish\r\na bimetallic currency, undertook free coinage upon a ratio which\r\naccidentally varied from the actual relative values of the two metals\r\nnot more than 3 per cent. In both cases, notwithstanding greater\r\ndifficulties and cost of transportation than now exist, the coins whose\r\nintrinsic worth was undervalued in the ratio gradually and surely\r\ndisappeared from our circulation and went to other countries where their\r\nreal value was better recognized.\r\n\r\nActs of Congress were impotent to create equality where natural causes\r\ndecreed even a slight inequality.\r\n\r\nTwice in our recent history we have signally failed to raise by\r\nlegislation the value of silver. Under an act of Congress passed in\r\n1878 the Government was required for more than twelve years to expend\r\nannually at least $24,000,000 in the purchase of silver bullion for\r\ncoinage. The act of July 14, 1890, in a still bolder effort, increased\r\nthe amount of silver the Government was compelled to purchase and forced\r\nit to become the buyer annually of 54,000,000 ounces, or practically the\r\nentire product of our mines. Under both laws silver rapidly and steadily\r\ndeclined in value. The prophecy and the expressed hope and expectation\r\nof those in the Congress who led in the passage of the last-mentioned\r\nact that it would reestablish and maintain the former parity between the\r\ntwo metals are still fresh in our memory.\r\n\r\nIn the light of these experiences, which accord with the experiences of\r\nother nations, there is certainly no secure ground for the belief that\r\nan act of Congress could now bridge an inequality of 50 per cent between\r\ngold and silver at our present ratio, nor is there the least possibility\r\nthat our country, which has less than one-seventh of the silver money\r\nin the world, could by its action alone raise not only our own but all\r\nsilver to its lost ratio with gold. Our attempt to accomplish this by\r\nthe free coinage of silver at a ratio differing widely from actual\r\nrelative values would be the signal for the complete departure of\r\ngold from our circulation, the immediate and large contraction of our\r\ncirculating medium, and a shrinkage in the real value and monetary\r\nefficiency of all other forms of currency as they settled to the level\r\nof silver monometallism. Everyone who receives a fixed salary and every\r\nworker for wages would find the dollar in his hand ruthlessly scaled\r\ndown to the point of bitter disappointment, if not to pinching\r\nprivation.\r\n\r\nA change in our standard to silver monometallism would also bring on a\r\ncollapse of the entire system of credit, which, when based on a standard\r\nwhich is recognized and adopted by the world of business, is many times\r\nmore potent and useful than the entire volume of currency and is safely\r\ncapable of almost indefinite expansion to meet the growth of trade and\r\nenterprise. In a self-invited struggle through darkness and uncertainty\r\nour humiliation would be increased by the consciousness that we had\r\nparted company with all the enlightened and progressive nations of the\r\nworld and were desperately and hopelessly striving to meet the stress of\r\nmodern commerce and competition with a debased and unsuitable currency\r\nand in association with the few weak and laggard nations which have\r\nsilver alone as their standard of value.\r\n\r\nAll history warns us against rash experiments which threaten violent\r\nchanges in our monetary standard and the degradation of our currency.\r\nThe past is full of lessons teaching not only the economic dangers but\r\nthe national immorality that follow in the train of such experiments.\r\nI will not believe that the American people can be persuaded after sober\r\ndeliberation to jeopardize their nation's prestige and proud standing by\r\nencouraging financial nostrums, nor that they will yield to the false\r\nallurements of cheap money when they realize that it must result in the\r\nweakening of that financial integrity and rectitude which thus far in\r\nour history has been so devotedly cherished as one of the traits of true\r\nAmericanism.\r\n\r\nOur country's indebtedness, whether owing by the Government or existing\r\nbetween individuals, has been contracted with reference to our present\r\nstandard. To decree by act of Congress that these debts shall be payable\r\nin less valuable dollars than those within the contemplation and\r\nintention of the parties when contracted would operate to transfer by\r\nthe fiat of law and without compensation an amount of property and a\r\nvolume of rights and interests almost incalculable.\r\n\r\nThose who advocate a blind and headlong plunge to free coinage in\r\nthe name of bimetallism, and professing the belief, contrary to all\r\nexperience, that we could thus establish a double standard and a\r\nconcurrent circulation of both metals in our coinage, are certainly\r\nreckoning from a cloudy standpoint. Our present standard of value is the\r\nstandard of the civilized world and permits the only bimetallism now\r\npossible, or at least that is within the independent reach of any single\r\nnation, however powerful that nation may be. While the value of gold as\r\na standard is steadied by almost universal commercial and business use,\r\nit does not despise silver nor seek its banishment. Wherever this\r\nstandard is maintained there is at its side in free and unquestioned\r\ncirculation a volume of silver currency sometimes equaling and sometimes\r\neven exceeding it in amount, both maintained at a parity notwithstanding\r\na depreciation or fluctuation in the intrinsic value of silver.\r\n\r\nThere is a vast difference between a standard of value and\r\na currency for monetary use. The standard must necessarily be fixed\r\nand certain. The currency may be in divers forms and of various kinds.\r\nNo silver-standard country has a gold currency in circulation, but an\r\nenlightened and wise system of finance secures the benefits of both gold\r\nand silver as currency and circulating medium by keeping the standard\r\nstable and all other currency at par with it. Such a system and such\r\na standard also give free scope for the use and expansion of safe and\r\nconservative credit, so indispensable to broad and growing commercial\r\ntransactions and so well substituted for the actual use of money. If\r\na fixed and stable standard is maintained, such as the magnitude and\r\nsafety of our commercial transactions and business require, the use\r\nof money itself is conveniently minimized.\r\n\r\nEvery dollar of fixed and stable value has through the agency of\r\nconfident credit an astonishing capacity of multiplying itself in\r\nfinancial work. Every unstable and fluctuating dollar fails as a basis\r\nof credit, and in its use begets gambling speculation and undermines the\r\nfoundations of honest enterprise.\r\n\r\nI have ventured to express myself on this subject with earnestness and\r\nplainness of speech because I can not rid myself of the belief that\r\nthere lurk in the proposition for the free coinage of silver, so\r\nstrongly approved and so enthusiastically advocated by a multitude\r\nof my countrymen, a serious menace to our prosperity and an insidious\r\ntemptation of our people to wander from the allegiance they owe to\r\npublic and private integrity. It is because I do not distrust the\r\ngood faith and sincerity of those who press this scheme that I have\r\nimperfectly but with zeal submitted my thoughts upon this momentous\r\nsubject. I can not refrain from begging them to reexamine their views\r\nand beliefs in the light of patriotic reason and familiar experience and\r\nto weigh again and again the consequences of such legislation as their\r\nefforts have invited. Even the continued agitation of the subject adds\r\ngreatly to the difficulties of a dangerous financial situation already\r\nforced upon us.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I especially entreat the people's representatives\r\nin the Congress, who are charged with the responsibility of inaugurating\r\nmeasures for the safety and prosperity of our common country, to\r\npromptly and effectively consider the ills of our critical financial\r\nplight. I have suggested a remedy which my judgment approves. I desire,\r\nhowever, to assure the Congress that I am prepared to cooperate with\r\nthem in perfecting any other measure promising thorough and practical\r\nrelief, and that I will gladly labor with them in every patriotic\r\nendeavor to further the interests and guard the welfare of our\r\ncountrymen, whom in our respective places of duty we have undertaken\r\nto serve.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: See pp. 439, 531-532.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: See p. 477.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: See p. 624.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: See pp. 561-565.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: See pp. 567-568.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _December 17, 1895_.\r\n\r\n_To the Congress_:\r\n\r\nIn my annual message addressed to the Congress on the 3d instant I\r\ncalled attention to the pending boundary controversy between Great\r\nBritain and the Republic of Venezuela and recited the substance of a\r\nrepresentation made by this Government to Her Britannic Majesty's\r\nGovernment suggesting reasons why such dispute should be submitted to\r\narbitration for settlement and inquiring whether it would be so\r\nsubmitted.[28]\r\n\r\nThe answer of the British Government, which was then awaited, has since\r\nbeen received, and, together with the dispatch to which it is a reply,\r\nis hereto appended.\r\n\r\nSuch reply is embodied in two communications addressed by the British\r\nprime minister to Sir Julian Pauncefote, the British ambassador at this\r\ncapital. It will be seen that one of these communications is devoted\r\nexclusively to observations upon the Monroe doctrine, and claims that\r\nin the present instance a new and strange extension and development\r\nof this doctrine is insisted on by the United States; that the reasons\r\njustifying an appeal to the doctrine enunciated by President Monroe are\r\ngenerally inapplicable \"to the state of things in which we live at the\r\npresent day,\" and especially inapplicable to a controversy involving the\r\nboundary line between Great Britain and Venezuela.\r\n\r\nWithout attempting extended argument in reply to these positions, it may\r\nnot be amiss to suggest that the doctrine upon which we stand is strong\r\nand sound, because its enforcement is important to our peace and safety\r\nas a nation and is essential to the integrity of our free institutions\r\nand the tranquil maintenance of our distinctive form of government. It\r\nwas intended to apply to every stage of our national life and can not\r\nbecome obsolete while our Republic endures. If the balance of power is\r\njustly a cause for jealous anxiety among the Governments of the Old\r\nWorld and a subject for our absolute noninterference, none the less is\r\nan observance of the Monroe doctrine of vital concern to our people and\r\ntheir Government.\r\n\r\nAssuming, therefore, that we may properly insist upon this doctrine\r\nwithout regard to \"the state of things in which we live\" or any changed\r\nconditions here or elsewhere, it is not apparent why its application may\r\nnot be invoked in the present controversy.\r\n\r\nIf a European power by an extension of its boundaries takes possession\r\nof the territory of one of our neighboring Republics against its will\r\nand in derogation of its rights, it is difficult to see why to that\r\nextent such European power does not thereby attempt to extend its system\r\nof government to that portion of this continent which is thus taken.\r\nThis is the precise action which President Monroe declared to be\r\n\"dangerous to our peace and safety,\" and it can make no difference\r\nwhether the European system is extended by an advance of frontier or\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\nIt is also suggested in the British reply that we should not seek to\r\napply the Monroe doctrine to the pending dispute because it does not\r\nembody any principle of international law which \"is founded on the\r\ngeneral consent of nations,\" and that \"no statesman, however eminent,\r\nand no nation, however powerful, are competent to insert into the code\r\nof international law a novel principle which was never recognized before\r\nand which has not since been accepted by the government of any other\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\nPractically the principle for which we contend has peculiar, if not\r\nexclusive, relation to the United States. It may not have been admitted\r\nin so many words to the code of international law, but since in\r\ninternational councils every nation is entitled to the rights belonging\r\nto it, if the enforcement of the Monroe doctrine is something we may\r\njustly claim it has its place in the code of international law as\r\ncertainly and as securely as if it were specifically mentioned; and when\r\nthe United States is a suitor before the high tribunal that administers\r\ninternational law the question to be determined is whether or not we\r\npresent claims which the justice of that code of law can find to be\r\nright and valid.\r\n\r\nThe Monroe doctrine finds its recognition in those principles of\r\ninternational law which are based upon the theory that every nation\r\nshall have its rights protected and its just claims enforced.\r\n\r\nOf course this Government is entirely confident that under the sanction\r\nof this doctrine we have clear rights and undoubted claims. Nor is this\r\nignored in the British reply. The prime minister, while not admitting\r\nthat the Monroe doctrine is applicable to present conditions, states:\r\n\r\n  In declaring that the United States would resist any such enterprise if\r\n  it was contemplated, President Monroe adopted a policy which received\r\n  the entire sympathy of the English Government of that date.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe further declares:\r\n\r\n  Though the language of President Monroe is directed to the attainment\r\n  of objects which most Englishmen would agree to be salutary, it is\r\n  impossible to admit that they have been inscribed by any adequate\r\n  authority in the code of international law.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain he says:\r\n\r\n  They [Her Majesty's Government] fully concur with the view which\r\n  President Monroe apparently entertained, that any disturbance of the\r\n  existing territorial distribution in that hemisphere by any fresh\r\n  acquisitions on the part of any European State would be a highly\r\n  inexpedient change.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the belief that the doctrine for which we contend was clear and\r\ndefinite, that it was founded upon substantial considerations and\r\ninvolved our safety and welfare, that it was fully applicable to our\r\npresent conditions and to the state of the world's progress, and that\r\nit was directly related to the pending controversy, and without any\r\nconviction as to the final merits of the dispute, but anxious to learn\r\nin a satisfactory and conclusive manner whether Great Britain sought\r\nunder a claim of boundary to extend her possessions on this continent\r\nwithout right, or whether she merely sought possession of territory\r\nfairly included within her lines of ownership, this Government proposed\r\nto the Government of Great Britain a resort to arbitration as the proper\r\nmeans of settling the question, to the end that a vexatious boundary\r\ndispute between the two contestants might be determined and our exact\r\nstanding and relation in respect to the controversy might be made clear.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the correspondence herewith submitted that this\r\nproposition has been declined by the British Government upon grounds\r\nwhich in the circumstances seem to me to be far from satisfactory. It is\r\ndeeply disappointing that such an appeal, actuated by the most friendly\r\nfeelings toward both nations directly concerned, addressed to the sense\r\nof justice and to the magnanimity of one of the great powers of the\r\nworld, and touching its relations to one comparatively weak and small,\r\nshould have produced no better results.\r\n\r\nThe course to be pursued by this Government in view of the present\r\ncondition does not appear to admit of serious doubt. Having labored\r\nfaithfully for many years to induce Great Britain to submit this dispute\r\nto impartial arbitration, and having been now finally apprised of her\r\nrefusal to do so, nothing remains but to accept the situation, to\r\nrecognize its plain requirements, and deal with it accordingly. Great\r\nBritain's present proposition has never thus far been regarded as\r\nadmissible by Venezuela, though any adjustment of the boundary which\r\nthat country may deem for her advantage and may enter into of her own\r\nfree will can not of course be objected to by the United States.\r\n\r\nAssuming, however, that the attitude of Venezuela will remain unchanged,\r\nthe dispute has reached such a stage as to make it now incumbent upon\r\nthe United States to take measures to determine with sufficient\r\ncertainty for its justification what is the true divisional line between\r\nthe Republic of Venezuela and British Guiana. The inquiry to that end\r\nshould of course be conducted carefully and judicially, and due weight\r\nshould be given to all available evidence, records, and facts in support\r\nof the claims of both parties.\r\n\r\nIn order that such an examination should be prosecuted in a thorough\r\nand satisfactory manner, I suggest that the Congress make an adequate\r\nappropriation for the expenses of a commission, to be appointed by the\r\nExecutive, who shall make the necessary investigation and report upon\r\nthe matter with the least possible delay. When such report is made and\r\naccepted it will, in my opinion, be the duty of the United States to\r\nresist by every means in its power, as a willful aggression upon its\r\nrights and interests, the appropriation by Great Britain of any lands or\r\nthe exercise of governmental jurisdiction over any territory which after\r\ninvestigation we have determined of right belongs to Venezuela.\r\n\r\nIn making these recommendations I am fully alive to the responsibility\r\nincurred and keenly realize all the consequences that may follow.\r\n\r\nI am, nevertheless, firm in my conviction that while it is a grievous\r\nthing to contemplate the two great English-speaking peoples of the world\r\nas being otherwise than friendly competitors in the onward march of\r\ncivilization and strenuous and worthy rivals in all the arts of peace,\r\nthere is no calamity which a great nation can invite which equals that\r\nwhich follows a supine submission to wrong and injustice and the\r\nconsequent loss of national self-respect and honor, beneath which are\r\nshielded and defended a people's safety and greatness.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: See p. 632.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, December 19, 1895_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn response to the resolution of the Senate of the 4th instant,\r\nrequesting the President, \"if in his judgment not incompatible with the\r\npublic interest, to communicate to the Senate all information which has\r\nbeen received by him or by the State Department in regard to injuries\r\ninflicted upon the persons or property of American citizens in Turkey\r\nand in regard to the condition of affairs there in reference to the\r\noppression or cruelties practiced upon the Armenian subjects of the\r\nTurkish Government; also to inform the Senate whether all the American\r\nconsuls in the Turkish Empire are at their posts of duty, and, if not,\r\nto state any circumstances which have interfered with the performance\r\nof the duties of such consuls,\" I transmit herewith a report from the\r\nSecretary of State.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _December 20, 1895_.\r\n\r\n_To the Congress_:\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message the evils of our present financial system\r\nwere plainly pointed out and the causes and means of the depletion of\r\nGovernment gold were explained. It was therein stated that after all the\r\nefforts that had been made by the executive branch of the Government\r\nto protect our gold reserve by the issuance of bonds amounting to more\r\nthan $162,000,000, such reserve then amounted to but little more than\r\n$79,000,000; that about $16,000,000 had been withdrawn from such reserve\r\nduring the month next previous to the date of that message, and that\r\nquite large withdrawals for shipment in the immediate future were\r\npredicted.\r\n\r\nThe contingency then feared has reached us, and the withdrawals of gold\r\nsince the communication referred to and others that appear inevitable\r\nthreaten such a depletion in our Government gold reserve as brings us\r\nface to face to the necessity of further action for its protection. This\r\ncondition is intensified by the prevalence in certain quarters of sudden\r\nand unusual apprehension and timidity in business circles.\r\n\r\nWe are in the midst of another season of perplexity caused by our\r\ndangerous and fatuous financial operations. These may be expected to\r\nrecur with certainty as long as there is no amendment in our financial\r\nsystem. If in this particular instance our predicament is at all\r\ninfluenced by a recent insistence upon the position we should occupy in\r\nour relation to certain questions concerning our foreign policy, this\r\nfurnishes a signal and impressive warning that even the patriotic\r\nsentiment of our people is not an adequate substitute for a sound\r\nfinancial policy.\r\n\r\nOf course there can be no doubt in any thoughtful mind as to the\r\ncomplete solvency of our nation, nor can there be any just apprehension\r\nthat the American people will be satisfied with less than an honest\r\npayment of our public obligations in the recognized money of the\r\nworld. We should not overlook the fact, however, that aroused fear\r\nis unreasoning and must be taken into account in all efforts to avert\r\npossible loss and the sacrifice of our people's interests.\r\n\r\nThe real and sensible cure for our recurring troubles can only be\r\neffected by a complete change in our financial scheme. Pending that\r\nthe executive branch of the Government will not relax its efforts\r\nnor abandon its determination to use every means within its reach\r\nto maintain before the world American credit, nor will there be any\r\nhesitation in exhibiting its confidence in the resources of our country\r\nand the constant patriotism of our people.\r\n\r\nIn view, however, of the peculiar situation now confronting us,\r\nI have ventured to herein express the earnest hope that the Congress,\r\nin default of the inauguration of a better system of finance, will not\r\ntake a recess from its labors before it has by legislative enactment or\r\ndeclaration done something not only to remind those apprehensive among\r\nour own people that the resources of their Government and a scrupulous\r\nregard for honest dealing afford a sure guaranty of unquestioned safety\r\nand soundness, but to reassure the world that with these factors and the\r\npatriotism of our citizens the ability and determination of our nation\r\nto meet in any circumstances every obligation it incurs do not admit of\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nI ask at the hands of the Congress such prompt aid as it alone has\r\nthe power to give to prevent in a time of fear and apprehension any\r\nsacrifice of the people's interests and the public funds or the\r\nimpairment of our public credit in an effort by Executive action to\r\nrelieve the dangers of the present emergency.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, December 30, 1895_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn response to the resolution of the Senate of the 21st instant,\r\nrelative to the refusal of the Turkish Government to grant exequaturs to\r\nthe vice-consuls of the United States at Erzerum and Harpoot, I transmit\r\nherewith a report from the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, January 10, 1896_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, in response to the Senate resolution of December\r\n18, 1895, addressed to the Secretary of State, a report of that officer,\r\nwith the accompanying correspondence, in relation to the arrest and\r\nimprisonment of Victor Hugo McCord at Arequipa, Peru, requested by said\r\nresolution.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 17, 1896_.\r\n\r\n_To the Congress_:\r\n\r\nI desire to invite attention to the necessity for prompt legislation\r\nin order to remove the limitation of the time within which suits may be\r\nbrought by the Government to annul unlawful or unauthorized grants of\r\npublic lands.\r\n\r\nBy the act of March 3, 1887 (24 U.S. Statutes at Large, p. 556), the\r\nSecretary of the Interior is directed to adjust each of the railroad\r\nland grants which may be unadjusted, and it is provided, if it shall\r\nappear upon the completion of such adjustment or sooner that the lands\r\nhave been from any cause erroneously certified or patented by the United\r\nStates to or for the use of a company claiming under any of said grants,\r\nit shall be the duty of the Secretary of the Interior to demand a\r\nreconveyance of the title to all lands so erroneously certified or\r\npatented, and on failure of the company to make such reconveyance within\r\nninety days the Attorney-General is required to institute and prosecute\r\nin the proper courts necessary proceedings to restore title to said\r\nlands to the United States. The demands made under this act have been\r\nnumerous, and in some cases have resulted in the reinvestment of title\r\nto the lands in the United States upon demand, but in most cases the\r\ndemand has been refused and suits have been necessary.\r\n\r\nThe work of adjustment has been unavoidably slow. The said act makes\r\nprovision for the reinstatement of entries erroneously canceled on\r\naccount of railroad withdrawals, and, upon certain conditions, provides\r\nfor the confirmation of titles derived by purchase from the companies\r\nof lands shown to be excepted from the grants. It contemplates a\r\ndisposition of every tract, described by the granting act, situated\r\nwithin the primary or granted limits; an inspection of each tract\r\ncertified or patented to the company within such limit, to determine\r\nwhether such certification or patenting was proper; the listing of those\r\ntracts shown to be erroneously certified, and the determination for what\r\ntracts lost to the grant indemnity is to be allowed.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary in making such an adjustment that all questions of\r\nconflicting claims, either between settlers and the road or between two\r\nroads the grants for which conflict or overlap, be finally disposed of,\r\nso that a proper disposition of the land can be shown in the adjustment.\r\nWhile adjustments have proceeded with the utmost rapidity consistent\r\nwith a due regard for the rights of the settlers, of the United States,\r\nand the railroad companies, and while to this end the force of adjusters\r\nhas been largely augmented in the General Land Office, many of the\r\ngrants yet remain unadjusted.\r\n\r\nIn some of the grants, notably the corporation grants, the lack of\r\nsurveys up to the present time made the completion of the work\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nDecisions rendered by the Interior Department in numerous conflicts\r\nhave been carried into the courts. The construction of the Interior\r\nDepartment has generally been sustained when final determination has\r\nbeen reached, but many of the cases are still pending in the courts,\r\nnot yet having been decided. Some of these cases, while involving\r\nimmediately the title to only one particular tract, will when decided\r\nfurnish a rule of construction to control the disposition of the title\r\nto thousands of acres of other lands in the same situation. Until the\r\ncourts pass upon these questions final adjustments can not be made.\r\n\r\nBy section 8 of the act of March 3, 1891 (26 U.S. Statutes at Large, p.\r\n1099), it is expressly enacted that suits by the United States to vacate\r\nand annul any patent theretofore issued \"shall only be brought within\r\nfive years from the passage of this act.\" This period of five years will\r\nexpire on the 3d of March, 1896. Of course no suit by the United States\r\nto secure the cancellation of a patent in this class of cases after\r\nthat date would be effective. Indeed, it is now too late to initiate\r\nproceedings looking to any such suit, inasmuch as demand has to be first\r\nmade on the company, and thereafter ninety days must be allowed for\r\ncompliance or refusal, in accordance with the provisions of the act of\r\nMarch 3, 1887. Before the expiration of this period the statute would\r\nbar the right of recovery by the Government, and the benefits of\r\nanticipated favorable decisions of the courts would be lost so far as\r\nthey might determine the character and disposition of grants similar\r\nto those directly involved in pending cases.\r\n\r\nIt will be readily seen that if this act of limitations is to remain on\r\nthe statute books the portion of the adjustment act referred to would be\r\nrendered nugatory. Indeed, there would be but little use in continuing\r\nthe adjustment of many of the land grants, inasmuch as ascertained\r\nrights of the United States or of settlers could not be enforced by law.\r\n\r\nLegislation establishing limitations against the right of the Government\r\nto sue is an innovation not entirely consistent with the general history\r\nof the rights of the Government, for it has uniformly been held that\r\ntime did not bar the sovereign power from the assertion of a right.\r\n\r\nThe early adjudications of the Land Department construed the grants with\r\na degree of liberality toward the grantees which later decisions of the\r\ncourts and of the Department have not sustained. It seems clear that the\r\nfurther progress of adjustments will develop facts and transactions in\r\nconnection with these land grants which ought to be the subjects of\r\nlegal examination and scrutiny before they are allowed to become final\r\nand conclusive. The Government should not be prevented from going into\r\nthe courts to right wrongs perpetrated by its agents or any other\r\nparties, and by which much of the public domain may be diverted from the\r\npeople at large to corporate uses.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances it seems to me that the act of 1891 should be\r\nso amended as not to apply to suits brought to recover title to lands\r\ncertified or patented on account of railroad or other grants; and\r\nI respectfully urge upon Congress speedy action to the end suggested,\r\nso that the adjustment of these grants may proceed without the\r\ninterposition of a bar, through lapse of time, against the right of\r\nrecovery by the Government in proper cases.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, January 20, 1896_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn response to the resolution of the House of Representatives of\r\nDecember 28, 1895, I transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of\r\nState and accompanying papers, relating to certain speeches made by\r\nThomas F.

It is specifically declared\r\nthat it shall not be necessary to submit said leases to the Secretary of\r\nthe Interior for approval, and that no leases shall be made for a longer\r\nterm than five years nor for a term extending beyond the date of the\r\nadmission of the Territory to statehood.\r\n\r\nUnder these provisions the lands reserved for university and school\r\npurposes, whose value largely depends upon their standing timber, and in\r\nwhich every citizen of the Territory has a deep interest, may be leased\r\nand denuded of their timber by officers none of whom have been chosen by\r\nthe people, and without the sanction of any law or regulation made by\r\ntheir representatives in the local legislature. Even the measure of\r\nprotection which would be afforded the citizens of the Territory by a\r\nsubmission to the Secretary of the Interior of the leases proposed, and\r\nthus giving him an opportunity to ascertain whether or not they comply\r\nwith his regulations, is especially withheld.\r\n\r\nIt was hardly necessary to provide in this bill that these lands\r\nmight be leased \"under such laws and regulations as may be hereafter\r\nprescribed by the legislature of said Territory\" if the action of the\r\nlegislature was to be forestalled and rendered nugatory by the immediate\r\nand unrestrained action of the officers constituted \"a board for the\r\nleasing of said lands\" pending such legislative consideration. These\r\nare inconsistencies which are not satisfactorily accounted for by the\r\nsuggestion that the time that would elapse before the legislature could\r\nconsider the subject would be important.\r\n\r\nThe protests I have received from numerous and influential citizens of\r\nthe Territory indicate considerable opposition to this bill among those\r\ninterested in the preservation and proper management of these school\r\nlands.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _April 21, 1896_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return without my approval Senate bill No. 894, entitled\r\n\"An act granting a pension to Nancy G.

Her case is also, indirectly,\r\none of those provided for by the general act passed in 1890, commonly\r\ncalled the dependent-pension law.\r\n\r\nIt is proposed, however, by the special act under consideration to give\r\nthis widow a pension of $30 a month without the least suggestion of the\r\ndeath or disability of her husband having been caused by his military\r\nservice, and solely, as far as is discoverable, upon the ground that she\r\nis poor and needs the money.\r\n\r\nThis condition is precisely covered by existing general laws; and if a\r\nprecedent is to be established by the special legislation proposed, I do\r\nnot see how the same relief as is contained in this bill can be denied\r\nto the many thousand widows who in a similar situation are now on the\r\npension rolls under general laws.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _April 21, 1896_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI return herewith without my approval Senate bill No. 249, entitled\r\n\"An act granting a pension to Charles E.

He\r\nwas injured, apparently not very seriously, while taking photographs and\r\nwhen no battle was in actual progress. He was not enlisted, and was in\r\nno manner in the military service of the United States.\r\n\r\nAside from the question as to whether his present sad condition is\r\nattributable to the injury mentioned, it seems to me the extension of\r\npension relief to such cases would open the door to legislation hard to\r\njustify and impossible to restrain from abuse.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _April 25, 1896_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return without my approval House bill No. 1094, entitled\r\n\"An act granting a pension to Francis E. Hoover.\"\r\n\r\nIt is proposed by this bill to grant a pension of $50 a month to the\r\nbeneficiary named, who served as a private for about one year and nine\r\nmonths in the Union Army during the War of the Rebellion.\r\n\r\nI do not understand it is claimed in any quarter that the present\r\nhelpless condition of this soldier is at all attributable to his army\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nHe himself never applied for a pension until after the passage of the\r\nlaw of 1890, providing for a pension for those who had served in the\r\nArmy and are unable to maintain themselves by manual labor on account of\r\ndisability not chargeable to army service. The committee of the House of\r\nRepresentatives in reporting this bill declare: \"The testimony does not\r\nshow the disease of the soldier to be of service origin.\"\r\n\r\nThe beneficiary is now receiving the largest pension permitted under the\r\nlaw of 1890.\r\n\r\nHis condition may well excite our sympathy, but to grant him a pension\r\nof $50 a month without the least suggestion that his pitiable disability\r\nis related to his army service, and in view of the fact that he is now\r\nreceiving the highest pension allowed by a general law enacted to\r\nexpressly meet such cases, it seems to me would result in an unfair\r\ndiscrimination as against many thousand worthy soldiers similarly\r\nsituated, and would invite applications which, while difficult to refuse\r\nin the face of such a precedent, must certainly lead to the breaking\r\ndown of all the limitations and restrictions provided by our laws\r\nregulating pensions.\r\n\r\nThe value of pension legislation depends as much upon fairness and\r\njustice in its administration as it does upon its liberality and\r\ngenerosity.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 19, 1896_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return herewith without approval House bill No. 1139, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to Caroline D. Mowatt.\"\r\n\r\nThe beneficiary mentioned in this bill was married in 1858 to Alfred B.\r\nSoule, who served as major of a Maine regiment of volunteers in the War\r\nof the Rebellion from September 10, 1862, to July 15, 1863, when he was\r\nmustered out of the service. He died in February, 1864, and in 1866 a\r\npension was granted to the beneficiary as his widow at the rate of $25 a\r\nmonth, dating from the time of her husband's death, two years before.\r\n\r\nThe widow continued to receive the pension allowed her until June 17,\r\n1869, when She was married to Henry T. Mowatt, which under the law\r\nterminated her pensionable right. It appears, however, that a small\r\npension was allowed two minor children of the soldier at the time of\r\ntheir mother's remarriage, which continued until 1876, more than seven\r\nyears after such remarriage, when the youngest of said children became\r\n16 years of age.\r\n\r\nIn 1878, nine years after he became the second husband of the\r\nbeneficiary, Henry T. Mowatt died.\r\n\r\nThough twenty-seven years have passed since the beneficiary ceased to\r\nbe the widow of the deceased soldier, and though she has been the widow\r\nof Henry T. Mowatt for eighteen years, it is proposed by the bill under\r\nconsideration to again place her name upon the pension roll \"as widow\r\nof Alfred B. Soule, late major of the Twenty-third Regiment Maine\r\nVolunteers.\"\r\n\r\nOf course the propriety of the law which terminates the pension of a\r\nsoldier's widow upon her remarriage will not be questioned. I suppose no\r\none would suggest the renewal of such pension during the lifetime of her\r\nsecond husband. Her pensionable relation to the Government as the widow\r\nof her deceased soldier husband, under any reasonable pension theory,\r\nabsolutely terminated with her remarriage.\r\n\r\nIf she is to be again pensioned because her second husband does not\r\nsurvive her, the transaction has more the complexion of an adjustment\r\nof a governmental insurance on the life of the second husband than the\r\nallowance of a pension on just and reasonable grounds.\r\n\r\nLegislation of this description is sure to establish a precedent which\r\nit will be difficult to disclaim, and which if followed can not fail to\r\nlead to abuse.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 20, 1896_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return herewith without approval House bill No. 577, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to Lydia A. Taft.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1858 the beneficiary named in this bill became the wife of Lowell\r\nTaft, who afterwards enlisted in the Union Army as a private in a\r\nConnecticut regiment and served from August, 1862, until June, 1865.\r\nThe records of the War Department show that he was captured by the\r\nenemy June 15, 1863, and paroled July 14, 1863.\r\n\r\nNo application for a pension was ever made by him, though he lived until\r\n1891, when he died at a soldiers' home in Connecticut.\r\n\r\nNo suggestion is made that he incurred any disability in the service or\r\nthat his death was in any manner related to such service.\r\n\r\nIn 1882, nearly twenty-four years after her marriage to the soldier\r\nand seventeen years after his discharge from the Army, the beneficiary\r\nobtained a divorce from him upon the grounds of habitual drunkenness\r\nand failure to afford her a support.\r\n\r\nIt is now proposed, five years after the soldier's death, to pension as\r\nhis widow the wife who was divorced from him at her own instance\r\nfourteen years ago.\r\n\r\nA government's generous care for widows deprived of a husband's support\r\nand companionship by the casualties or disabilities of war rests upon\r\ngrounds which all must cheerfully approve; but it is difficult to place\r\nupon these grounds the case of this proposed beneficiary, who has\r\nrenounced a wife's relation, with all its duties and all its rights, and\r\nwho by her own act placed herself beyond the possibility of becoming the\r\nwidow of her soldier husband.\r\n\r\nIf, as stated in the report of the House committee on this bill, the\r\nbeneficiary for some reason contributed something toward the soldier's\r\nsupport after her divorce and paid the expense of his burial, the fact\r\nstill remains that this soldier died in a soldiers' home wifeless and\r\nleaving no one surviving who, claiming to be his widow, should be\r\nallowed to profit by his death.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 21, 1896_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return without approval House bill No. 1185, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to Rachel Patton.\"\r\n\r\nJohn H. Patton, the husband of the beneficiary, was a captain in an\r\nIllinois regiment, and was killed in action June 25, 1863.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1863, the beneficiary was pensioned as his widow at the\r\nrate of $20 a month.\r\n\r\nShe received this pension for thirteen years and until 1876, when she\r\nmarried one William G. Culbertson. Thereupon, because of such marriage,\r\nher name was dropped from the pension rolls, pursuant to law.\r\n\r\nIn 1889, thirteen years after her remarriage and the termination of her\r\npension, she procured a decree of divorce against her second husband on\r\nthe ground of desertion.\r\n\r\nShe has a small income, but it does not appear that alimony was allowed\r\nher in the divorce proceedings.\r\n\r\nIt is proposed by this bill to pension her at the same rate which was\r\nallowed her while she remained the widow of the deceased soldier.\r\n\r\nIt can not be denied that the remarriage of this beneficiary terminated\r\nher pensionable relation to the Government as completely as if it never\r\nexisted. The statute which so provides simply declares what is approved\r\nby a fair and sensible consideration of pension principles. As a legal\r\nproposition, the pensionable status of a soldier's widow, lost by her\r\nremarriage, can not be recovered by the dissolution of the second\r\nmarriage. Waiving, however, the application of strictly legal principles\r\nto the subject, there does not appear to be any sentiment which should\r\nrestore to the pension rolls as the widow of a deceased soldier a\r\ndivorced wife who has relinquished the title of soldier's widow to again\r\nbecome a wife, and who to secure the expected advantages and comforts of\r\na second marriage has been quite willing to forego the provision which\r\nwas made for her by the Government solely on the grounds of her soldier\r\nwidowhood.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 23, 1896_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return without approval House bill No. 4804, entitled \"An act\r\nto amend subdivision 10 of section 2238 of the Revised Statutes of the\r\nUnited States.\"\r\n\r\nThe subdivision of the section of the law proposed to be amended by\r\nthis bill has reference to the fees allowed receivers and registers at\r\npublic-land offices. This subdivision now reads as follows:\r\n\r\n  Tenth. Registers and receivers are allowed jointly at the rate of 15\r\n  cents per hundred words for testimony reduced by them to writing for\r\n  claimants in establishing preemption and homestead rights.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bill under consideration so amends this subdivision that in the\r\nfirst clause a compensation of 10 cents per hundred words is allowed\r\nto the registers and receivers for reducing to writing the testimony\r\nof claimants \"in all cases,\" instead of 15 cents per hundred words for\r\nreducing to writing testimony \"in establishing preemption and homestead\r\nrights,\" as provided in the old law.\r\n\r\nWhether this reduction of fees preserves an adequate and just\r\ncompensation to the officers affected I suppose has been duly considered\r\nby the Congress.\r\n\r\nThe bill, however, after providing for this change in compensation,\r\ncontains the following words:\r\n\r\n  And in all cases where they [the registers and receivers] can secure a\r\n  competent person to reduce the testimony to writing for a sum less per\r\n  folio than the sum herein prescribed it shall be their duty to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the addition of these words the bill seems to give certain fees by\r\nway of official compensation to the officers named for certain services\r\nto be performed by them and at the same time to provide that if they can\r\nsecure other persons willing to perform these services for a less sum\r\nthan the amount allowed to them they shall forego their fees in favor of\r\nsuch persons.\r\n\r\nIt is very important that the fees and perquisites of public officers\r\nshould be definitely and clearly fixed, so that the official may know\r\nprecisely the items of his lawful compensation and the people be\r\nprotected from extortion and imposition.\r\n\r\nA public officer ought not to be expected to search very industriously\r\nfor a person to underbid him for official work, and if such a person\r\nappeared the temptation to combination and conspiracy would in many\r\ncases lead to abuse.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the officers are not given by this amendment\r\nthe option to do this work themselves at 10 cents per folio or secure a\r\ncompetent person to do it at a less rate, nor, if they desire, are they\r\nallowed to compete with those willing to accept a less compensation.\r\nThey may charge a fixed rate for the service if performed by them, but\r\nin any event if they can procure another party to perform the services\r\nfor a less sum they must do so.\r\n\r\nI am convinced that this bill in its present form, perhaps through\r\nunfortunate phraseology, if it became a law would lead to confusion and\r\nuncertainty and would invite practices against which the public service\r\nought to be carefully guarded.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 26, 1896_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return herewith without approval House bill No. 7161, entitled \"An act\r\nfor the relief of Benjamin F. Jones.\"\r\n\r\nThis bill directs the payment to the beneficiary, late postmaster\r\nat Beauregard, Miss., or to his order, of the sum of $50, in full\r\ncompensation for services and expenses in carrying and distributing\r\nthe mails between Wesson and Beauregard, in the State of Mississippi,\r\nin 1883.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the report of the House committee recommending the\r\npassage of this bill that on April 22, 1883, while Mr. Jones was\r\npostmaster at Beauregard, a cyclone destroyed every building in the\r\nplace, including that in which the post-office was kept; that in\r\nconsequence of this disaster the mails for Beauregard were for a period\r\nof thirty-five days, and until May 27, 1883, deposited at Wesson, 1 mile\r\ndistant; that during that time it became necessary to transport such\r\nmails from Wesson to Beauregard, and that the postmaster caused this to\r\nbe done, at an expense of $97.\r\n\r\nA report from the Postmaster-General discloses the fact that this claim\r\nwas presented to the Department in 1884 and was rejected on the ground\r\nthat if the service was performed as alleged it was not authorized or\r\ndirected by the Department.\r\n\r\nIn 1885 a suit was instituted against this postmaster and his sureties\r\nfor a balance due the Government from him on his official accounts for\r\nthe quarter ending June 30, 1883.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that this quarter covered the period within which\r\nthe alleged services were performed.\r\n\r\nIn the suit referred to a judgment was recovered by the Government\r\nagainst the postmaster for $190.45, being the balance found due from\r\nhim. This judgment still remains unpaid.\r\n\r\nIn this condition of affairs it is quite plain that in fairness and\r\njustice no appropriation should be made in favor of the claimant.\r\n\r\nIt is the opinion of the Auditor of the Post-Office Department that even\r\nif this bill becomes a law payment of the money appropriated should be\r\nwithheld under a section of the Revised Statutes which provides:\r\n\r\n  No money shall be paid to any person for his compensation who is in\r\n  arrears to the United States until he has accounted for and paid into\r\n  the Treasury all sums for which he may be liable.\r\n\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 29, 1896_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return herewith without approval House bill No. 7977, entitled \"An act\r\nmaking appropriations for the construction, repair, and preservation of\r\ncertain public works on rivers and harbors, and for other purposes.\"\r\n\r\nThere are 417 items of appropriation contained in this bill, and every\r\npart of the country is represented in the distribution of its favors.\r\n\r\nIt directly appropriates or provides for the immediate expenditure of\r\nnearly $14,000,000 for river and harbor work. This sum is in addition to\r\nappropriations contained in another bill for similar purposes amounting\r\nto a little more than $3,000,000, which have already been favorably\r\nconsidered at the present session of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe result is that the contemplated immediate expenditures for the\r\nobjects mentioned amount to about $17,000,000.\r\n\r\nA more startling feature of this bill is its authorization of contracts\r\nfor river and harbor work amounting to more than $62,000,000. Though the\r\npayments on these contracts are in most cases so distributed that they\r\nare to be met by future appropriations, more than $3,000,000 on their\r\naccount are included in the direct appropriations above mentioned. Of\r\nthe remainder, nearly $20,000,000 will fall due during the fiscal year\r\nending June 30, 1898, and amounts somewhat less in the years immediately\r\nsucceeding. A few contracts of a like character authorized under\r\nprevious statutes are still outstanding, and to meet payments on these\r\nmore than $4,000,000 must be appropriated in the immediate future.\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, this bill becomes a law, the obligations which will be\r\nimposed on the Government, together with the appropriations made for\r\nimmediate expenditure on account of rivers and harbors, will amount to\r\nabout $80,000,000. Nor is this all. The bill directs numerous surveys\r\nand examinations which contemplate new work and further contracts and\r\nwhich portend largely increased expenditures and obligations.\r\n\r\nThere is no ground to hope that in the face of persistent and growing\r\ndemands the aggregate of appropriations for the smaller schemes, not\r\ncovered by contracts, will be reduced or even remain stationary. For the\r\nfiscal year ending June 30, 1898, such appropriations, together with the\r\ninstallments on contracts which will fall due in that year, can hardly\r\nbe less than $30,000,000; and it may reasonably be apprehended that the\r\nprevalent tendency toward increased expenditures of this sort and the\r\nconcealment which postponed payments afford for extravagance will\r\nincrease the burdens chargeable to this account in succeeding years.\r\n\r\nIn view of the obligation imposed upon me by the Constitution, it\r\nseems to me quite clear that I only discharge a duty to our people when\r\nI interpose my disapproval of the legislation proposed.\r\n\r\nMany of the objects for which it appropriates public money are not\r\nrelated to the public welfare, and many of them are palpably for the\r\nbenefit of limited localities or in aid of individual interests.\r\n\r\nOn the face of the bill it appears that not a few of these alleged\r\nimprovements have been so improvidently planned and prosecuted that\r\nafter an unwise expenditure of millions of dollars new experiments for\r\ntheir accomplishment have been entered upon.\r\n\r\nWhile those intrusted with the management of public funds in the\r\ninterest of all the people can hardly justify questionable expenditures\r\nfor public work by pleading the opinions of engineers or others as to\r\nthe practicability of such work, it appears that some of the projects\r\nfor which appropriations are proposed in this bill have been entered\r\nupon without the approval or against the objections of the examining\r\nengineers.\r\n\r\nI learn from official sources that there are appropriations contained in\r\nthe bill to pay for work which private parties have actually agreed with\r\nthe Government to do in consideration of their occupancy of public\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nWhatever items of doubtful propriety may have escaped observation or may\r\nhave been tolerated in previous Executive approvals of similar bills,\r\nI am convinced that the bill now under consideration opens the way to\r\ninsidious and increasing abuses and is in itself so extravagant as to be\r\nespecially unsuited to these times of depressed business and resulting\r\ndisappointment in Government revenue. This consideration is emphasized\r\nby the prospect that the public Treasury will be confronted with other\r\nappropriations made at the present session of Congress amounting to more\r\nthan $500,000,000.\r\n\r\nIndividual economy and careful expenditure are sterling virtues\r\nwhich lead to thrift and comfort. Economy and the exaction of clear\r\njustification for the appropriation of public moneys by the servants\r\nof the people are not only virtues, but solemn obligations.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the appropriations contained in this bill are\r\ninstigated by private interests and promote local or individual projects\r\ntheir allowance can not fail to stimulate a vicious paternalism and\r\nencourage a sentiment among our people, already too prevalent, that\r\ntheir attachment to our Government may properly rest upon the hope and\r\nexpectation of direct and especial favors and that the extent to which\r\nthey are realized may furnish an estimate of the value of governmental\r\ncare.\r\n\r\nI believe no greater danger confronts us as a nation than the unhappy\r\ndecadence among our people of genuine and trustworthy love and affection\r\nfor our Government as the embodiment of the highest and best aspirations\r\nof humanity, and not as the giver of gifts, and because its mission is\r\nthe enforcement of exact justice and equality, and not the allowance of\r\nunfair favoritism.\r\n\r\nI hope I may be permitted to suggest, at a time when the issue of\r\nGovernment bonds to maintain the credit and financial standing of the\r\ncountry is a subject of criticism, that the contracts provided for in\r\nthis bill would create obligations of the United States amounting to\r\n$62,000,000 no less binding than its bonds for that sum.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 29, 1896_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return without approval Senate bill No. 147, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to Elvira Bachelder.\"\r\n\r\nThis bill provides for a pension to the beneficiary as dependent mother\r\nof \"J.K.P.

Mahoney.\"\r\n\r\nThis bill directs the Secretary of the Treasury to receive and pay to\r\nW.H. Mahoney, without the indorsement of N.A. Rogers, a certain bond\r\nissued by the United States in 1861 for the sum of $500, such payment to\r\nbe made upon the giving by said Mahoney of a bond to hold harmless the\r\nUnited States against repayment of said bond.\r\n\r\nThe bond mentioned is one of a large issue which was authorized under an\r\nact passed March 2, 1861, and known as Oregon war-debt bonds. They were\r\nmade payable in 1881.\r\n\r\nIn 1864 an act was passed directing the Secretary of the Treasury to\r\nissue or cause to be issued to E.F. and Samuel A. Ward duplicates of\r\nnineteen of these bonds, particularly described by their numbers and\r\notherwise. Among others are mentioned \"Nos. 1352 to 1359, inclusive.\"\r\nThis of course includes the bond numbered 1358, which is directed to be\r\npaid in the bill under consideration. Nothing can now be discovered to\r\nindicate the occasion for the issuance of these duplicates, but from the\r\nfact that a bond of indemnity was required it is inferred that they were\r\nissued because of the loss or destruction of the original bonds.\r\n\r\nPursuant to this act a duplicate of the bond in question, among others,\r\nwas issued and made payable to the order of Thomas Pritchard, attorney,\r\nwho was the payee in the original bond.\r\n\r\nIn 1881 this duplicate was paid by the Treasury Department and is now in\r\npossession of the Government. The indorsement of the payee, \"Thomas\r\nPritchard, attorney,\" appears thereon and all other proper indorsements\r\nto show title in the party to whom the payment was made.\r\n\r\nThe Government has therefore once paid the amount of this bond to the\r\nparty apparently entitled to it. If the beneficiary named in this bill\r\nhas a better right to the money, the Government, not being in default,\r\nshould be protected against double payment. I suppose to sustain a\r\nclaim upon the indemnity bond given when the duplicate was issued in\r\n1864 we should be prepared to show that the second payment on the\r\noriginal bond was made upon such a state of facts as compelled or at\r\nleast justified it. The passage of an act simply directing such payment\r\nwould alone not be sufficient. The bond directed to be given by this\r\nbill would afford the Government no protection, since it only provides\r\nagainst repayment of the bond in the future, whereas the payment we\r\nshould suffer from has already been made.\r\n\r\nI suggest that an act be passed directing the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nto investigate the entire subject with a view of determining to whom\r\nthis money should be paid, in a manner to bind, if possible, by the\r\nresults of the examination the party to whom it has already been paid,\r\nand who should refund if another has a better right.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 30, 1896_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return without approval House bill No. 6037, entitled \"An act granting\r\na pension to Mrs. Amanda Woodcock.\"\r\n\r\nThe bill provides for the granting of a pension to the beneficiary\r\ntherein named, describing her as the \"widow of Robert Woodcock,\r\ndeceased, late a private in the Fourth United States Volunteer Infantry\r\nin the Mexican War.\"\r\n\r\nMy action in this case is based upon the following statement concerning\r\nthe bill from the Pension Bureau:\r\n\r\n  The bill, if approved, would be inoperative, inasmuch as there was\r\n  no such organization in the Mexican War as named in the bill (Fourth\r\n  United States Volunteer Infantry), and the service alleged by the\r\n  soldier having been in the Fourth Kentucky Volunteer Infantry.\r\n\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 30, 1896_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return without approval House bill No. 4526, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to Jonathan Scott.\"\r\n\r\nThis bill directs that the Secretary of the Interior place upon the\r\npension roll, at the rate of $72 per month, subject to the provisions\r\nand limitations of the pension laws, the name of Jonathan Scott, late\r\nof Company M, Sixth Regiment Iowa Volunteer Cavalry.\r\n\r\nThe beneficiary was dropped from the pension roll in October, 1895,\r\nafter a very thorough examination, for fraud, it appearing to the\r\nsatisfaction of the Pension Bureau that the disability for which he was\r\npensioned was not due to his army service. There certainly ought to be\r\na strong presumption that the case was fairly and justly determined by\r\nthe Bureau, and the evidence strongly tends to support the conclusion\r\nreached. If restored to the rolls, such restoration would still be\r\n\"subject to the provisions and limitations of the pension laws,\" and he\r\nwould not be exempt from further investigation if circumstances or newly\r\ndeveloped facts justified such a course.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the merits of the case, however, I am advised by the\r\nPension Bureau that the bill, if it becomes a law in its present form,\r\nwould be inoperative for the reason that the beneficiary is therein\r\ndescribed as having been a member of the Sixth Regiment of Iowa\r\nVolunteer Cavalry, whereas he actually served in the Fifth Regiment of\r\nthe Volunteer Cavalry of that State.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 1, 1896_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return without approval Senate bill No. 149, entitled \"An act\r\ngranting a pension to Helen M. Jacob.\"\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this bill is to grant a pension of $12 per month to\r\n\"Helen M. Jacob, of Rochester, Ind., widow of Benjamin Oden West.\"\r\n\r\nIt appears from the records of the War Department that Benjamin O. West\r\nserved in the Mexican War from January to November in the year 1847. The\r\nbeneficiary named in this bill was married to him in 1850, and he died\r\nin 1856. She was pensioned as his widow, and received such pension from\r\nthe date of her husband's death until April 17, 1861. On that date she\r\nwas married to William W. Jacob, whereupon her pension ceased, but two\r\nminor children were awarded pensions and continued in receipt of the\r\nsame until January, 1873, when the youngest child became 16 years of\r\nage.\r\n\r\nThe entire absence of any fixed or reasonable principle or rule\r\nregulating private pension legislation at this time suggests the danger\r\nof its near approach in many cases to caprice and favoritism.\r\n\r\nThough I have in a number of instances deferred to the judgment of\r\nCongress and refrained from interposing objections to bills of this\r\ncharacter which seemed to me to be of doubtful merit, I am unwilling to\r\nfollow such a wide departure from a palpably just pension theory and\r\nassent to the establishment of such an unfortunate precedent as this\r\nbill involves.\r\n\r\nThere is no duty or obligation due from the Government to a soldier's\r\nwidow except it be worked out through the deceased soldier. She is\r\npensioned only because he served his country and because through his\r\ndeath she as his wife has lost his support. In other words, she becomes\r\na beneficiary of the Government because she is a soldier's widow. When\r\nshe marries again, and thus displaces the memory of her soldier husband\r\nand surrenders all that belongs to soldier widowhood, she certainly\r\nought not on the death of her second husband to be allowed to claim that\r\nshe is again the soldier's widow.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 6, 1896_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI hereby return without my approval House bill No. 8293, entitled \"An\r\nact making appropriations to supply deficiencies in the appropriations\r\nfor the fiscal year ending June 30, 1896, and for prior years, and for\r\nother purposes.\"\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the Constitution has devolved upon the President a\r\nparticipation in legislation I suppose his action on bills presented to\r\nhim for approval involves a duty to be performed, like others pertaining\r\nto his office, with care and circumspection and in full view of his\r\nresponsibility to the people and his obligation to subserve the public\r\nwelfare. It is difficult to understand why under the Constitution it\r\nshould be necessary to submit proposed legislation to Executive scrutiny\r\nand approval except to invoke the exercise of Executive judgment and\r\ninvite independent Executive action.\r\n\r\nThe unpleasant incidents which accompany the use of the veto power would\r\ntempt its avoidance if such a course did not involve an abandonment of\r\nconstitutional duty and an assent to legislation for which the Executive\r\nis not willing to share the responsibility.\r\n\r\nI regret that I am constrained to disapprove an important appropriation\r\nbill so near the close of the present session of Congress. I have,\r\nhowever, by immediate action after the receipt of the bill, endeavored\r\nto delay as little as possible a reconsideration of this proposed\r\nlegislation, though I am thus obliged to content myself with a less\r\ncomplete explanation of my objections than would otherwise be submitted.\r\n\r\nThis bill is in many of its features far removed from a legitimate\r\ndeficiency bill, and it contains a number of appropriations which seem\r\nto me to be exceedingly questionable. Without noticing in detail many of\r\nthese items, I shall refer to two of them which, in my judgment, justify\r\nmy action in the premises.\r\n\r\nThe bill appropriates $1,027,314.09 for a partial payment upon claims\r\nwhich originated in depredations upon our commerce by French cruisers\r\nand vessels during the closing years of the last century. They have\r\nbecome quite familiar to those having Congressional experience, as they\r\nhave been pressed for recognition and payment, with occasional intervals\r\nof repose, for nearly one hundred years.\r\n\r\nThese claims are based upon the allegations that France, being at war\r\nwith England, seized and condemned many American vessels and cargoes in\r\nviolation of the rules of international law and treaty provisions and\r\ncontrary to the duty she owed to our country as a neutral power and to\r\nour citizens; that by reason of these acts claims arose in favor of such\r\nof our citizens as were demnified against the French nation, which\r\nclaims our Government attempted to enforce, and that in concluding a\r\ntreaty with France in the year 1800 these claims were abandoned or\r\nrelinquished in consideration of the relinquishment of certain claims\r\nwhich France charged against us.\r\n\r\nUpon these statements it is insisted by those interested that we as a\r\nnation having reaped a benefit in our escape from these French demands\r\nagainst us through the abandonment of the claims of our citizens against\r\nFrance, the Government became equitably bound as between itself and its\r\ncitizens to pay the claims thus relinquished.\r\n\r\nI do not understand it to be asserted that there exists any legal\r\nliability against the Government on account of its relation to these\r\nclaims. At the term of the Supreme Court just finished the Chief\r\nJustice, in an opinion concerning them and the action of Congress in\r\nappropriating for their payment, said:\r\n\r\n  We think that payments thus prescribed to be made were purposely\r\n  brought within the category of payments by way of gratuity--payments\r\n  of grace and not of right.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the time the plan was conceived to charge the Government with\r\nthe payment of these claims they have abided in the atmosphere of\r\ncontroversy. Every proposition presented in their support has been\r\nstoutly disputed and every inference suggested in their favor has\r\nbeen promptly challenged.\r\n\r\nThus, inasmuch as it must, I think, be conceded that if a state of war\r\nexisted between our country and France at the time these depredations\r\nwere committed our Government was not justified in claiming indemnity\r\nfor our citizens, it is asserted that we were at the time actually\r\nengaged in war with the French nation. This position seems to be\r\nsustained by an opinion of the Attorney-General of the United States\r\nwritten in 1798 and by a number of decisions of the Supreme Court\r\ndelivered soon after that time.\r\n\r\nWe had certainly abrogated treaties with France, and our cruisers and\r\narmed ships were roaming the seas capturing her vessels and property.\r\n\r\nSo, also, when it is asserted that the validity of these claims was\r\nacknowledged in the treaty negotiations by the representatives of\r\nFrance, their declarations to a contrary purport are exhibited.\r\n\r\nAnd when it is alleged that the abandonment of these claims against\r\nFrance was in consideration of great benefits to the Government, it is\r\nas confidently alleged that they were in point of fact abandoned because\r\ntheir enforcement was hopeless and that even if any benefit really\r\naccrued to us by insistence upon their settlement in the course of\r\ndiplomatic negotiation such result gave no pretext for taxing the\r\nGovernment with liability to the claimants.\r\n\r\nWithout noticing other considerations and contentions arising from the\r\nalleged origin of these claims, a brief reference to their treatment in\r\nthe past and the development of their presentation may be useful and\r\npertinent.\r\n\r\nIt is, I believe, somewhat the fashion in interested quarters to speak\r\nof the failure by the Government to pay these claims as such neglect\r\nas amounts to repudiation and a denial of justice to citizens who have\r\nsuffered. Of course the original claimants have for years been beyond\r\nthe reach of relief; but as their descendants in each generation become\r\nmore numerous the volume of advocacy, importunity, and accusation\r\ncorrespondingly increases. If injustice has been done in the refusal of\r\nthese claims, it began early in the present century and may be charged\r\nagainst men then in public life more conversant than we can be with the\r\nfacts involved and whose honesty and sense of right ought to be secure\r\nfrom suspicion.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1802 a committee of the House of Representatives reported\r\nthe facts connected with these claims, but apparently without\r\nrecommendation. No action was taken on the report. In 1803 a resolution\r\ndeclaring that indemnity ought to be paid was negatived by a vote of the\r\nsame body. A favorable committee report was made in 1807, but it seems\r\nthat no legislative action resulted. In 1818 an adverse report was made\r\nto the Senate, followed by the passage of a resolution declaring \"that\r\nthe relief asked by the memorialists and petitioners ought not to be\r\ngranted.\" In 1822 and again in 1824 adverse committee reports on the\r\nsubject were made to the House, concluding with similar resolutions.\r\n\r\nThe presumption against these claims arising from such unfavorable\r\nreports and resolutions and from the failure of Congress to provide for\r\ntheir payment at a time so near the events upon which they are based can\r\nnot be destroyed by the interested cry of injustice and neglect of the\r\nrights of our citizens.\r\n\r\nUntil 1846 these claims were from time to time pressed upon the\r\nattention of Congress with varying fortunes, but never with favorable\r\nlegislative action. In that year, however, a bill was passed for their\r\nascertainment and satisfaction, and $5,000,000 were appropriated for\r\ntheir payment. This bill was vetoed by President Polk,[31] who declared\r\nthat he could \"perceive no legal or equitable ground upon which this\r\nlarge appropriation can rest.\" This veto was sustained by the House of\r\nRepresentatives.\r\n\r\nNine years afterwards, and in 1855, another bill was passed similar to\r\nthe one last mentioned, and appropriating for the settlement of these\r\nclaims a like sum of money. This bill was also vetoed,[32] President\r\nPierce concluding a thorough discussion of its demerits with these\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n  In view of what has been said there would seem to be no ground on which\r\n  to raise a liability of the United States, unless it be the assumption\r\n  that the United States are to be considered the insurer and the\r\n  guarantor of all claims, of whatever nature, which any individual\r\n  citizen may have against a foreign nation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis veto was also sustained by the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nI think it will be found that in all bills proposed in former times for\r\nthe payment of these claims the sum to be appropriated for that purpose\r\ndid not exceed $5,000,000. It is now estimated that those already passed\r\nupon, with those still pending for examination in the Court of Claims,\r\nmay amount to $25,000,000. This indicates either that the actual\r\nsufferers or those nearer to them in time and blood than the present\r\nclaimants underestimated their losses or that there has been a great\r\ndevelopment in the manner of their presentation.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding persistent efforts to secure payment from the\r\nGovernment and the importunity of those interested, no appropriation has\r\never been made for that purpose except a little more than $1,300,000,\r\nwhich was placed in the general deficiency bill in the very last hours\r\nof the session of Congress on March 3, 1891.\r\n\r\nIn the long list of beneficiaries who are provided for in the bill now\r\nbefore me on account of these claims 152 represent the owners of ships\r\nand their cargoes and 186 those who lost as insurers of such vessels or\r\ncargoes.\r\n\r\nThese insurers by the terms of their policies undertook and agreed\r\n\"to bear and take upon themselves all risks and perils of the sea,\r\nmen-of-war, fire, enemies, rovers, thieves, jettison, letters of mart\r\nand counter mart, surprisals, takings at sea, arrests, restraints, and\r\ndetainments of all kings, princes, or people of what nation, condition,\r\nor quality whatsoever.\"\r\n\r\nThe premiums received on these policies were large, and the losses\r\nwere precisely those within the contemplation of the insurers. It is\r\nwell known that the business of insurance is entered upon with the\r\nexpectation that the premiums received will pay all losses and yield a\r\nprofit to the insurance in addition; and yet, without any showing that\r\nthe business did not result in a profit to these insurance claimants,\r\nit is proposed that the Government shall indemnify them against the\r\nprecise risks they undertook, notwithstanding the fact that the money\r\nappropriated is not to be paid except \"by way of gratuity--payments\r\nas of grace and not of right.\"\r\n\r\nThe appropriations to indemnify against insurance losses rest upon\r\nweaker grounds, it seems to me, than those of owners; but in the light\r\nof all the facts and circumstances surrounding these spoliation claims,\r\nas they are called, none of them, in my opinion, should be paid by the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nAnother item in this bill which seems to me especially objectionable is\r\nan appropriation in favor of Charles P. Chouteau, survivor, etc., of\r\n$174,445.75, in full satisfaction of all claims arising out of the\r\nconstruction of the ironclad steam battery _Etlah_.\r\n\r\nThe contract for the construction of this battery was made by the\r\nGovernment with Charles W. McCord during the war, and he was to be paid\r\ntherefor the sum of $386,000. He was paid this sum and $210,991 for\r\nextras, and in May, 1866, gave his receipt in full. The assignee of\r\nMcCord in bankruptcy assigned to Chouteau and his associates in 1868\r\nall claims of McCord against the United States for the precise extras\r\nfor which he had receipted in full two years before. Chouteau brought\r\nsuit in the Court of Claims for such extras and was defeated. I can not\r\ngather from the facts I have been able to collect concerning this\r\nappropriation that it is justified on any ground.\r\n\r\nIn 1890 my immediate predecessor vetoed a bill allowing the matter to be\r\nexamined again by the Court of Claims.[33]\r\n\r\nIf the additional payment proposed in this bill was made, the cost of\r\nthe battery in question would be almost double that of the contract\r\nprice.\r\n\r\nI have determined to submit this incomplete presentation of my\r\nobjections to this bill at once in order that the Congress may act\r\nthereon without embarrassment or the interruption of plans for an early\r\nadjournment.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: See Vol. IV, pp. 466-469.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: See Vol. V, pp. 307-322.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: See p. 93]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 10, 1896_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return without my approval House bill No. 225, entitled \"An\r\nact to provide for the lease of Fort Omaha Military Reservation to the\r\nState of Nebraska.\"\r\n\r\nThis bill authorizes and directs the Secretary of War, when Fort Crook,\r\nnear the city of Omaha, is ready for occupancy, to lease for a nominal\r\nrent to the State of Nebraska the possession of Fort Omaha Military\r\nReservation, containing about 80 acres, with all the buildings,\r\nappurtenances, and improvements thereof. It is declared that the lease\r\nshall be conditional upon the use of said reservation by the State of\r\nNebraska as a place of rendezvous and school of instruction for the\r\nNational Guard of said State; that the State of Nebraska shall while it\r\nis in possession of said reservation keep the buildings and improvements\r\nthereon in as good condition and repair as at the date it shall enter\r\ninto possession thereof, and that at any time when, in the judgment of\r\nthe Secretary of War, the interests of the United States shall require\r\nsuch action he shall take possession of said military reservation for\r\nthe use of the Government, together with all the buildings,\r\nappurtenances, and improvements thereon.\r\n\r\nOn the 23d day of July, 1888, an act was passed authorizing the\r\nSecretary of War to purchase suitable grounds, of not less than 640\r\nacres in extent, to be situate within 10 miles of the city of Omaha, and\r\nto construct the necessary buildings thereon for a ten-company military\r\npost, to be known as Fort Omaha, and a necessary sum, not exceeding\r\n$200,000, was appropriated to enable the Secretary of War to carry out\r\nthe provisions of said act.\r\n\r\nThe said act also authorized the Secretary of War, when the purchase of\r\nthe new site should be effected, to sell the military reservation known\r\nas Fort Omaha and such of the buildings and improvements thereon as\r\ncould not be economically removed to the new site, and to cause the said\r\nreservation, for the purposes of said sale, to be platted in blocks,\r\nstreets, and alleys, if in his judgment it would inure to the benefit of\r\nthe Government in making a sale of such site.\r\n\r\nThe new site provided for by this act has been purchased, a large sum of\r\nmoney has been spent by the Government in preparing it for use, and I\r\nunderstand it will soon be ready for occupancy. The authority to sell\r\nthe old site has not been exercised. This may be accounted for by the\r\nfact that the Government has not thus far been able to dispense with its\r\nuse or because the depression in land values at Omaha has rendered it\r\nunadvisable.\r\n\r\nThe authority to sell and to remove any of the buildings from the old\r\nreservation to the new site still remains, however, unimpaired. In this\r\ncondition of affairs it is now proposed to lease this land and these\r\nbuildings to the State of Nebraska at a nominal rent, allowing the\r\nGovernment to repossess it only \"when the interests of the United States\r\nshall require such action.\"\r\n\r\nOf course it would be claimed that this language, in view of the\r\nstatute of 1888, should not be construed as permitting the Government to\r\nretake the property for the purpose of selling it, because that is not\r\nstipulated in the bill. For that reason it would be plausibly urged that\r\nthe lease was paramount to the power of sale contained in the law of\r\n1888 and that the omission of any provision that possession might be\r\nresumed for the purpose of sale plainly indicated that \"the interests of\r\nthe United States\" which allow such resumption contemplate some other\r\nand different emergency.\r\n\r\nAs a practical question, we all know that transactions of this character\r\nrelating to Government property amount to a permanent alienation, or\r\ncertainly pave the way for an absolute grant.\r\n\r\nI do not think there should be anything done with this valuable property\r\nwhich will in the least embarrass the Government in its sale, and to\r\nthat extent reimbursing itself for the cost of the new military post,\r\nwhich was plainly contemplated in the law of 1888.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas the Congress of the United States passed an act, which was\r\napproved on the 16th day of July, 1894, entitled \"An act to enable the\r\npeople of Utah to form a constitution and State government and to be\r\nadmitted into the Union on an equal footing with the original States,\"\r\nwhich act provided for the election of delegates to a constitutional\r\nconvention to meet at the seat of government of the Territory of Utah\r\non the first Monday in March, 1895, for the purpose of declaring the\r\nadoption of the Constitution of the United States by the people of the\r\nproposed State and forming a constitution and State government for such\r\nState;

The appointing or nominating officer shall request certification\r\n  to him of the names of eligibles for the position vacant, and the\r\n  Commission shall certify to said officer from the proper register\r\n  the three names at the head thereof which have not been three times\r\n  certified to the Department or office in which the vacancy exists:\r\n  _Provided_, That certification for temporary appointment shall not\r\n  be counted as one of the three certifications to which an eligible is\r\n  entitled: _And provided further_, That whenever the sex of those\r\n  whose names are to be certified is fixed by any law, rule, or regulation\r\n  or is specified in the request for certification the names of those of\r\n  the sex so fixed or specified shall be certified, but in other cases\r\n  certification shall be made without regard to sex.\r\n\r\n  2. Of the three names certified the nominating or appointing officer\r\n  shall select one, and if at the time of selection there are more\r\n  vacancies than one he may select more than one name, unless otherwise\r\n  directed by the Commission.\r\n\r\n  3. If an eligible who is not entitled to certification is certified and\r\n  appointed, his appointment shall be immediately revoked by the\r\n  appointing officer upon notification from the Commission.\r\n\r\n  4. A person selected for appointment shall be notified of his selection\r\n  by the appointing or nominating officer, and upon his acceptance shall\r\n  receive from the appointing officer a certificate of appointment for a\r\n  probationary period of six months, at the end of which period, if the\r\n  conduct and capacity of the probationer are satisfactory to the\r\n  appointing officer, his retention in the service shall be equivalent to\r\n  his absolute appointment; but if his conduct or capacity be not\r\n  satisfactory he shall be notified by the appointing officer that he will\r\n  not receive absolute appointment because of such unsatisfactory conduct\r\n  or want of capacity, and such notification shall discharge him from the\r\n  service: _Provided_, That the probation of an employee in the\r\n  Indian-school service shall terminate at the end of the school year in\r\n  which he is appointed: _And provided further_, That the time which\r\n  an employee has actually served as substitute in parts of the service\r\n  where substitutes are authorized shall be counted as part of the\r\n  probationary period of his regular appointment, but that time served\r\n  under a temporary appointment shall not be so counted.\r\n\r\n  5. If the appointing or nominating officer shall object to an eligible\r\n  named in the certificate, stating that because of some physical defect,\r\n  mental unsoundness, or moral disqualification, particularly specified,\r\n  said eligible would be incompetent or unfit for the performance of the\r\n  duties of the vacant position, and if said officer shall sustain such\r\n  objection with evidence satisfactory to the Commission, the Commission\r\n  may certify the eligible on the register who is in average percentage\r\n  next below those already certified in place of the one to whom objection\r\n  is made and sustained.\r\n\r\n  6. Certifications for appointment of persons for service in or on direct\r\n  detail from any Department or office in Washington, D.C., shall be so\r\n  made as to maintain as nearly as possible the apportionment of such\r\n  appointments among the several States and Territories and District of\r\n  Columbia upon the basis of population, except to appointments in the\r\n  Government Printing Office, to the position of printer's assistant,\r\n  skilled helper, and operative in the Bureau of Engraving and Printing,\r\n  to positions in the post quartermaster's office, in the pension agency,\r\n  and other local offices in the District of Columbia, and to the\r\n  positions of page and messenger boy and apprentice or student.\r\n\r\n  7. Within any part of the service to which promotion regulations have\r\n  been or may hereafter be applied certification of those eligible to\r\n  original appointment shall not be made for filling a vacancy in a\r\n  position above the lowest class in any grade whenever there is any\r\n  person eligible and willing to be promoted to said vacancy:\r\n  _Provided_, That a vacancy in any position requiring the exercise\r\n  of technical or professional knowledge may be filled by original\r\n  appointment.\r\n\r\n  8. When two or more eligibles on a register have the same average\r\n  percentage, preference in certification shall be determined by the order\r\n  in which their applications were filed.\r\n\r\n  9.

In any part of the service in which the employment of substitutes is\r\n  not prohibited by law there may be certified and appointed in the manner\r\n  provided for in this rule only such number of substitutes as are\r\n  actually needed for the performance of substitute duty.\r\n\r\n  11. In any part of the service in which substitutes are employed\r\n  certifications of those eligible to original appointment shall be made\r\n  for filling vacancies in substitute positions only, and vacancies in\r\n  regular positions shall be filled by the appointment or promotion\r\n  thereto of substitutes in the order of their original appointment as\r\n  substitutes whenever there are substitutes of the required sex who are\r\n  eligible and willing to be so appointed or promoted. Substitutes so\r\n  appointed or promoted shall, however, be subject to the provisions of\r\n  these rules relating to probation and permanent appointment.\r\n\r\n  12. Upon request of the appointing or nominating officer preference\r\n  in certification may be given to the wife of the superintendent of an\r\n  Indian school for filling a vacancy in the position of teacher or matron\r\n  in said school.\r\n\r\n  13. Whenever there shall occur a vacancy which the public interest\r\n  requires shall be immediately filled and which can not be so filled in\r\n  time to meet the emergency by certification from the eligible registers,\r\n  such vacancy may, subject to the approval of the Commission, be filled\r\n  by temporary appointment without examination until a regular appointment\r\n  can be made. Such temporary appointment shall in no case continue longer\r\n  than ninety days, and shall expire by limitation at the end of that\r\n  time. No person shall serve longer than ninety days in any one year\r\n  under such temporary appointment or appointments, and in any event only\r\n  until a regular appointment can be made through examination and\r\n  certification. Said year limitation shall begin to run in the case of\r\n  any person on the date of his first such appointment: _Provided_,\r\n  That whenever an emergency shall arise requiring that a vacant position\r\n  in any internal-revenue district shall be filled before a certificate\r\n  can be issued by the Commission and an appointment made thereto in the\r\n  manner provided in these rules such position may be filled without\r\n  regard to the provisions of these rules by temporary appointment for a\r\n  period not to exceed thirty days, and only for such period as may be\r\n  required for the execution of the necessary details of an appointment\r\n  thereto in accordance with said provisions; but no person shall receive\r\n  such temporary appointment who within the ninety days next previous\r\n  thereto has been separated from a position in said district to which he\r\n  was temporarily appointed under the provisions of this section.\r\n\r\n  14. Whenever a temporary appointment shall be made through certification\r\n  from the eligible registers of the Commission in the manner provided in\r\n  these rules, such temporary appointment shall in no case continue longer\r\n  than six months, and shall expire by limitation at the end of that\r\n  period.\r\n\r\n\r\n  RULE IX.\r\n\r\n  A vacancy in any position which has been or may hereafter be classified\r\n  under the civil service act may, upon requisition of the proper officer\r\n  and the certificate of the Commission, be filled by the reinstatement\r\n  without examination of any person who within one year next preceding the\r\n  date of said requisition has through no delinquency or misconduct been\r\n  separated from a classified position at the date of said requisition and\r\n  in that Department or office and that branch of the service in which\r\n  said vacancy exists: _Provided_, That for original entrance to the\r\n  position proposed to be filled by reinstatement there is not required by\r\n  these rules, in the opinion of the Commission, an examination involving\r\n  essential tests different from or higher than those involved in the\r\n  examination for original entrance to the position formerly held by the\r\n  person proposed to be reinstated: _And provided further_, That,\r\n  subject to the other conditions of these rules, any person who served in\r\n  the military or naval service of the United States in the late War of\r\n  the Rebellion and was honorably discharged therefrom, or the widow of\r\n  any such person, may be reinstated without regard to the length of time\r\n  he or she has been separated from the service.\r\n\r\n\r\n  RULE X.\r\n\r\n  Within that part of the civil service of the United States which has\r\n  been or may hereafter be classified under the civil-service act\r\n  transfers shall be governed as follows:\r\n\r\n  1.

A political contest\r\ninvolving momentous consequences, fraught with feverish apprehension,\r\nand creating aggressiveness so intense as to approach bitterness and\r\npassion has been waged throughout our land and determined by the decree\r\nof free and independent suffrage without disturbance of our tranquillity\r\nor the least sign of weakness in our national structure.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider these incidents and contemplate the peaceful obedience\r\nand manly submission which have succeeded a heated clash of political\r\nopinions, we discover abundant evidence of a determination on the part\r\nof our countrymen to abide by every verdict of the popular will and\r\nto be controlled at all times by an abiding faith in the agencies\r\nestablished for the direction of the affairs of their Government.\r\n\r\nThus our people exhibit a patriotic disposition which entitles them\r\nto demand of those who undertake to make and execute their laws such\r\nfaithful and unselfish service in their behalf as can only be prompted\r\nby a serious appreciation of the trust and confidence which the\r\nacceptance of public duty invites.\r\n\r\nIn obedience to a constitutional requirement I herein submit to the\r\nCongress certain information concerning national affairs, with the\r\nsuggestion of such legislation as in my judgment is necessary and\r\nexpedient. To secure brevity and avoid tiresome narration I shall omit\r\nmany details concerning matters within Federal control which, though\r\nby no means unimportant, are more profitably discussed in departmental\r\nreports. I shall also further curtail this communication by omitting\r\na minute recital of many minor incidents connected with our foreign\r\nrelations which have heretofore found a place in Executive messages,\r\nbut are now contained in a report of the Secretary of State, which is\r\nherewith submitted.\r\n\r\nAt the outset of a reference to the more important matters affecting our\r\nrelations with foreign powers it would afford me satisfaction if I could\r\nassure the Congress that the disturbed condition in Asiatic Turkey had\r\nduring the past year assumed a less hideous and bloody aspect and that,\r\neither as a consequence of the awakening of the Turkish Government to\r\nthe demands of humane civilization or as the result of decisive action\r\non the part of the great nations having the right by treaty to interfere\r\nfor the protection of those exposed to the rage of mad bigotry and cruel\r\nfanaticism, the shocking features of the situation had been mitigated.\r\nInstead, however, of welcoming a softened disposition or protective\r\nintervention, we have been afflicted by continued and not infrequent\r\nreports of the wanton destruction of homes and the bloody butchery of\r\nmen, women, and children, made martyrs to their profession of Christian\r\nfaith.\r\n\r\nWhile none of our citizens in Turkey have thus far been killed or\r\nwounded, though often in the midst of dreadful scenes of danger, their\r\nsafety in the future is by no means assured. Our Government at home\r\nand our minister at Constantinople have left nothing undone to protect\r\nour missionaries in Ottoman territory, who constitute nearly all the\r\nindividuals residing there who have a right to claim our protection on\r\nthe score of American citizenship. Our efforts in this direction will\r\nnot be relaxed; but the deep feeling and sympathy that have been aroused\r\namong our people ought not to so far blind their reason and judgment as\r\nto lead them to demand impossible things. The outbreaks of blind fury\r\nwhich lead to murder and pillage in Turkey occur suddenly and without\r\nnotice, and an attempt on our part to force such a hostile presence\r\nthere as might be effective for prevention or protection would not only\r\nbe resisted by the Ottoman Government, but would be regarded as an\r\ninterruption of their plans by the great nations who assert their\r\nexclusive right to intervene in their own time and method for the\r\nsecurity of life and property in Turkey.\r\n\r\nSeveral naval vessels are stationed in the Mediterranean as a measure\r\nof caution and to furnish all possible relief and refuge in case of\r\nemergency.\r\n\r\nWe have made claims against the Turkish Government for the pillage\r\nand destruction of missionary property at Harpoot and Marash during\r\nuprisings at those places. Thus far the validity of these demands has\r\nnot been admitted, though our minister, prior to such outrages and\r\nin anticipation of danger, demanded protection for the persons and\r\nproperty of our missionary citizens in the localities mentioned and\r\nnotwithstanding that strong evidence exists of actual complicity of\r\nTurkish soldiers in the work of destruction and robbery.\r\n\r\nThe facts as they now appear do not permit us to doubt the justice of\r\nthese claims, and nothing will be omitted to bring about their prompt\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\nA number of Armenian refugees having arrived at our ports, an order has\r\nlately been obtained from the Turkish Government permitting the wives\r\nand children of such refugees to join them here. It is hoped that\r\nhereafter no obstacle will be interposed to prevent the escape of all\r\nthose who seek to avoid the perils which threaten them in Turkish\r\ndominions.\r\n\r\nOur recently appointed consul to Erzerum is at his post and discharging\r\nthe duties of his office, though for some unaccountable reason his\r\nformal exequatur from the Sultan has not been issued.\r\n\r\nI do not believe that the present somber prospect in Turkey will be long\r\npermitted to offend the sight of Christendom. It so mars the humane and\r\nenlightened civilization that belongs to the close of the nineteenth\r\ncentury that it seems hardly possible that the earnest demand of good\r\npeople throughout the Christian world for its corrective treatment will\r\nremain unanswered.\r\n\r\nThe insurrection in Cuba still continues with all its perplexities. It\r\nis difficult to perceive that any progress has thus far been made toward\r\nthe pacification of the island or that the situation of affairs as\r\ndepicted in my last annual message has in the least improved. If Spain\r\nstill holds Havana and the seaports and all the considerable towns, the\r\ninsurgents still roam at will over at least two-thirds of the inland\r\ncountry. If the determination of Spain to put down the insurrection\r\nseems but to strengthen with the lapse of time and is evinced by her\r\nunhesitating devotion of largely increased military and naval forces\r\nto the task, there is much reason to believe that the insurgents have\r\ngained in point of numbers and character and resources and are none\r\nthe less inflexible in their resolve not to succumb without practically\r\nsecuring the great objects for which they took up arms. If Spain has not\r\nyet reestablished her authority, neither have the insurgents yet made\r\ngood their title, to be regarded as an independent state. Indeed, as\r\nthe contest has gone on the pretense that civil government exists on\r\nthe island, except so far as Spain is able to maintain it, has been\r\npractically abandoned. Spain does keep on foot such a government, more\r\nor less imperfectly, in the large towns and their immediate suburbs;\r\nbut that exception being made, the entire country is either given over\r\nto anarchy or is subject to the military occupation of one or the other\r\nparty. It is reported, indeed, on reliable authority that at the demand\r\nof the commander in chief of the insurgent army the putative Cuban\r\ngovernment has now given up all attempt to exercise its functions,\r\nleaving that government confessedly (what there is the best reason for\r\nsupposing it always to have been in fact) a government merely on paper.\r\n\r\nWere the Spanish armies able to meet their antagonists in the open or in\r\npitched battle, prompt and decisive results might be looked for, and the\r\nimmense superiority of the Spanish forces in numbers, discipline, and\r\nequipment could hardly fail to tell greatly to their advantage. But they\r\nare called upon to face a foe that shuns general engagements, that can\r\nchoose and does choose its own ground, that from the nature of the\r\ncountry is visible or invisible at pleasure, and that fights only from\r\nambuscade and when all the advantages of position and numbers are on its\r\nside. In a country where all that is indispensable to life in the way of\r\nfood, clothing, and shelter is so easily obtainable, especially by those\r\nborn and bred on the soil, it is obvious that there is hardly a limit\r\nto the time during which hostilities of this sort may be prolonged.\r\nMeanwhile, as in all cases of protracted civil strife, the passions of\r\nthe combatants grow more and more inflamed and excesses on both sides\r\nbecome more frequent and more deplorable. They are also participated in\r\nby bands of marauders, who, now in the name of one party and now in the\r\nname of the other, as may best suit the occasion, harry the country at\r\nwill and plunder its wretched inhabitants for their own advantage. Such\r\na condition of things would inevitably entail immense destruction of\r\nproperty, even if it were the policy of both parties to prevent it as\r\nfar as practicable; but while such seemed to be the original policy of\r\nthe Spanish Government, it has now apparently abandoned it and is acting\r\nupon the same theory as the insurgents, namely, that the exigencies of\r\nthe contest require the wholesale annihilation of property that it may\r\nnot prove of use and advantage to the enemy.\r\n\r\nIt is to the same end that, in pursuance of general orders, Spanish\r\ngarrisons are now being withdrawn from plantations and the rural\r\npopulation required to concentrate itself in the towns. The sure\r\nresult would seem to be that the industrial value of the island is\r\nfast diminishing and that unless there is a speedy and radical change\r\nin existing conditions it will soon disappear altogether. That value\r\nconsists very largely, of course, in its capacity to produce sugar--a\r\ncapacity already much reduced by the interruptions to tillage which\r\nhave taken place during the last two years. It is reliably asserted\r\nthat should these interruptions continue during the current year, and\r\npractically extend, as is now threatened, to the entire sugar-producing\r\nterritory of the island, so much time and so much money will be required\r\nto restore the land to its normal productiveness that it is extremely\r\ndoubtful if capital can be induced to even make the attempt.\r\n\r\nThe spectacle of the utter ruin of an adjoining country, by nature\r\none of the most fertile and charming on the globe, would engage the\r\nserious attention of the Government and people of the United States in\r\nany circumstances. In point of fact, they have a concern with it which\r\nis by no means of a wholly sentimental or philanthropic character. It\r\nlies so near to us as to be hardly separated from our territory. Our\r\nactual pecuniary interest in it is second only to that of the people\r\nand Government of Spain. It is reasonably estimated that at least\r\nfrom $30,000,000 to $50,000,000 of American capital are invested in\r\nplantations and in railroad, mining, and other business enterprises\r\non the island. The volume of trade between the United States and Cuba,\r\nwhich in 1889 amounted to about $64,000,000, rose in 1893 to about\r\n$103,000,000, and in 1894, the year before the present insurrection\r\nbroke out, amounted to nearly $96,000,000. Besides this large pecuniary\r\nstake in the fortunes of Cuba, the United States finds itself\r\ninextricably involved in the present contest in other ways, both\r\nvexatious and costly.\r\n\r\nMany Cubans reside in this country, and indirectly promote the\r\ninsurrection through the press, by public meetings, by the purchase and\r\nshipment of arms, by the raising of funds, and by other means which the\r\nspirit of our institutions and the tenor of our laws do not permit to be\r\nmade the subject of criminal prosecutions. Some of them, though Cubans\r\nat heart and in all their feelings and interests, have taken out papers\r\nas naturalized citizens of the United States--a proceeding resorted\r\nto with a view to possible protection by this Government, and not\r\nunnaturally regarded with much indignation by the country of their\r\norigin. The insurgents are undoubtedly encouraged and supported by the\r\nwidespread sympathy the people of this country always and instinctively\r\nfeel for every struggle for better and freer government, and which,\r\nin the case of the more adventurous and restless elements of our\r\npopulation, leads in only too many instances to active and personal\r\nparticipation in the contest. The result is that this Government is\r\nconstantly called upon to protect American citizens, to claim damages\r\nfor injuries to persons and property, now estimated at many millions of\r\ndollars, and to ask explanations and apologies for the acts of Spanish\r\nofficials whose zeal for the repression of rebellion sometimes blinds\r\nthem to the immunities belonging to the unoffending citizens of a\r\nfriendly power. It follows from the same causes that the United States\r\nis compelled to actively police a long line of seacoast against unlawful\r\nexpeditions, the escape of which the utmost vigilance will not always\r\nsuffice to prevent.\r\n\r\nThese inevitable entanglements of the United States with the\r\nrebellion in Cuba, the large American property interests affected,\r\nand considerations of philanthropy and humanity in general have led\r\nto a vehement demand in various quarters for some sort of positive\r\nintervention on the part of the United States. It was at first proposed\r\nthat belligerent rights should be accorded to the insurgents--a\r\nproposition no longer urged because untimely and in practical operation\r\nclearly perilous and injurious to our own interests. It has since been\r\nand is now sometimes contended that the independence of the insurgents\r\nshould be recognized; but imperfect and restricted as the Spanish\r\ngovernment of the island may be, no other exists there, unless the will\r\nof the military officer in temporary command of a particular district\r\ncan be dignified as a species of government. It is now also suggested\r\nthat the United States should buy the island--a suggestion possibly\r\nworthy of consideration if there were any evidence of a desire or\r\nwillingness on the part of Spain to entertain such a proposal. It is\r\nurged finally that, all other methods failing, the existing internecine\r\nstrife in Cuba should be terminated by our intervention, even at the\r\ncost of a war between the United States and Spain--a war which its\r\nadvocates confidently prophesy could neither be large in its proportions\r\nnor doubtful in its issue.\r\n\r\nThe correctness of this forecast need be neither affirmed nor denied.\r\nThe United States has, nevertheless, a character to maintain as a\r\nnation, which plainly dictates that right and not might should be the\r\nrule of its conduct. Further, though the United States is not a nation\r\nto which peace is a necessity, it is in truth the most pacific of powers\r\nand desires nothing so much as to live in amity with all the world.\r\nIts own ample and diversified domains satisfy all possible longings for\r\nterritory, preclude all dreams of conquest, and prevent any casting of\r\ncovetous eyes upon neighboring regions, however attractive. That our\r\nconduct toward Spain and her dominions has constituted no exception\r\nto this national disposition is made manifest by the course of our\r\nGovernment, not only thus far during the present insurrection, but\r\nduring the ten years that followed the rising at Yara in 1868. No other\r\ngreat power, it may safely be said, under circumstances of similar\r\nperplexity, would have manifested the same restraint and the same\r\npatient endurance. It may also be said that this persistent attitude of\r\nthe United States toward Spain in connection with Cuba unquestionably\r\nevinces no slight respect and regard for Spain on the part of the\r\nAmerican people. They in truth do not forget her connection with the\r\ndiscovery of the Western Hemisphere, nor do they underestimate the\r\ngreat qualities of the Spanish people nor fail to fully recognize their\r\nsplendid patriotism and their chivalrous devotion to the national honor.\r\n\r\nThey view with wonder and admiration the cheerful resolution with which\r\nvast bodies of men are sent across thousands of miles of ocean and an\r\nenormous debt accumulated that the costly possession of the gem of the\r\nAntilles may still hold its place in the Spanish crown. And yet neither\r\nthe Government nor the people of the United States have shut their eyes\r\nto the course of events in Cuba or have failed to realize the existence\r\nof conceded grievances which have led to the present revolt from the\r\nauthority of Spain--grievances recognized by the Queen Regent and by\r\nthe Cortes, voiced by the most patriotic and enlightened of Spanish\r\nstatesmen, without regard to party, and demonstrated by reforms proposed\r\nby the executive and approved by the legislative branch of the Spanish\r\nGovernment. It is in the assumed temper and disposition of the Spanish\r\nGovernment to remedy these grievances, fortified by indications of\r\ninfluential public opinion in Spain, that this Government has hoped to\r\ndiscover the most promising and effective means of composing the present\r\nstrife with honor and advantage to Spain and with the achievement of all\r\nthe reasonable objects of the insurrection.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that if Spain should offer to Cuba genuine autonomy--a\r\nmeasure of home rule which, while preserving the sovereignty of Spain,\r\nwould satisfy all rational requirements of her Spanish subjects--there\r\nshould be no just reason why the pacification of the island might not\r\nbe effected on that basis. Such a result would appear to be in the true\r\ninterest of all concerned. It would at once stop the conflict which\r\nis now consuming the resources of the island and making it worthless\r\nfor whichever party may ultimately prevail. It would keep intact the\r\npossessions of Spain without touching her honor, which will be consulted\r\nrather than impugned by the adequate redress of admitted grievances.\r\nIt would put the prosperity of the island and the fortunes of its\r\ninhabitants within their own control without severing the natural and\r\nancient ties which bind them to the mother country, and would yet enable\r\nthem to test their capacity for self-government under the most favorable\r\nconditions. It has been objected on the one side that Spain should not\r\npromise autonomy until her insurgent subjects lay down their arms;\r\non the other side, that promised autonomy, however liberal, is\r\ninsufficient, because without assurance of the promise being fulfilled.\r\n\r\nBut the reasonableness of a requirement by Spain of unconditional\r\nsurrender on the part of the insurgent Cubans before their autonomy\r\nis conceded is not altogether apparent. It ignores important features\r\nof the situation--the stability two years' duration has given to the\r\ninsurrection; the feasibility of its indefinite prolongation in the\r\nnature of things, and, as shown by past experience, the utter and\r\nimminent ruin of the island unless the present strife is speedily\r\ncomposed; above all, the rank abuses which all parties in Spain, all\r\nbranches of her Government, and all her leading public men concede to\r\nexist and profess a desire to remove. Facing such circumstances, to\r\nwithhold the proffer of needed reforms until the parties demanding them\r\nput themselves at mercy by throwing down their arms has the appearance\r\nof neglecting the gravest of perils and inviting suspicion as to the\r\nsincerity of any professed willingness to grant reforms. The objection\r\non behalf of the insurgents that promised reforms can not be relied upon\r\nmust of course be considered, though we have no right to assume and no\r\nreason for assuming that anything Spain undertakes to do for the relief\r\nof Cuba will not be done according to both the spirit and the letter of\r\nthe undertaking.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, realizing that suspicions and precautions on the part\r\nof the weaker of two combatants are always natural and not always\r\nunjustifiable, being sincerely desirous in the interest of both as\r\nwell as on its own account that the Cuban problem should be solved with\r\nthe least possible delay, it was intimated by this Government to the\r\nGovernment of Spain some months ago that if a satisfactory measure of\r\nhome rule were tendered the Cuban insurgents and would be accepted by\r\nthem upon a guaranty of its execution the United States would endeavor\r\nto find a way not objectionable to Spain of furnishing such guaranty.\r\nWhile no definite response to this intimation has yet been received from\r\nthe Spanish Government, it is believed to be not altogether unwelcome,\r\nwhile, as already suggested, no reason is perceived why it should not be\r\napproved by the insurgents. Neither party can fail to see the importance\r\nof early action, and both must realize that to prolong the present\r\nstate of things for even a short period will add enormously to the\r\ntime and labor and expenditure necessary to bring about the industrial\r\nrecuperation of the island. It is therefore fervently hoped on all\r\ngrounds that earnest efforts for healing the breach between Spain and\r\nthe insurgent Cubans upon the lines above indicated may be at once\r\ninaugurated and pushed to an immediate and successful issue. The\r\nfriendly offices of the United States, either in the manner above\r\noutlined or in any other way consistent with our Constitution and laws,\r\nwill always be at the disposal of either party.\r\n\r\nWhatever circumstances may arise, our policy and our interests would\r\nconstrain us to object to the acquisition of the island or an\r\ninterference with its control by any other power.\r\n\r\nIt should be added that it can not be reasonably assumed that the\r\nhitherto expectant attitude of the United States will be indefinitely\r\nmaintained. While we are anxious to accord all due respect to the\r\nsovereignty of Spain, we can not view the pending conflict in all its\r\nfeatures and properly apprehend our inevitably close relations to it and\r\nits possible results without considering that by the course of events we\r\nmay be drawn into such an unusual and unprecedented condition as will\r\nfix a limit to our patient waiting for Spain to end the contest, either\r\nalone and in her own way or with our friendly cooperation.\r\n\r\nWhen the inability of Spain to deal successfully with the insurrection\r\nhas become manifest and it is demonstrated that her sovereignty is\r\nextinct in Cuba for all purposes of its rightful existence, and when a\r\nhopeless struggle for its reestablishment has degenerated into a strife\r\nwhich means nothing more than the useless sacrifice of human life and\r\nthe utter destruction of the very subject-matter of the conflict, a\r\nsituation will be presented in which our obligations to the sovereignty\r\nof Spain will be superseded by higher obligations, which we can hardly\r\nhesitate to recognize and discharge. Deferring the choice of ways and\r\nmethods until the time for action arrives, we should make them depend\r\nupon the precise conditions then existing; and they should not be\r\ndetermined upon without giving careful heed to every consideration\r\ninvolving our honor and interest or the international duty we owe to\r\nSpain. Until we face the contingencies suggested or the situation is by\r\nother incidents imperatively changed we should continue in the line of\r\nconduct heretofore pursued, thus in all circumstances exhibiting our\r\nobedience to the requirements of public law and our regard for the duty\r\nenjoined upon us by the position we occupy in the family of nations.\r\n\r\nA contemplation of emergencies that may arise should plainly lead us to\r\navoid their creation, either through a careless disregard of present\r\nduty or even an undue stimulation and ill-timed expression of feeling.\r\nBut I have deemed it not amiss to remind the Congress that a time may\r\narrive when a correct policy and care for our interests, as well as a\r\nregard for the interests of other nations and their citizens, joined by\r\nconsiderations of humanity and a desire to see a rich and fertile\r\ncountry intimately related to us saved from complete devastation, will\r\nconstrain our Government to such action as will subserve the interests\r\nthus involved and at the same time promise to Cuba and its inhabitants\r\nan opportunity to enjoy the blessings of peace.\r\n\r\nThe Venezuelan boundary question has ceased to be a matter of\r\ndifference between Great Britain and the United States, their respective\r\nGovernments having agreed upon the substantial provisions of a treaty\r\nbetween Great Britain and Venezuela submitting the whole controversy to\r\narbitration. The provisions of the treaty are so eminently just and fair\r\nthat the assent of Venezuela thereto may confidently be anticipated.\r\n\r\nNegotiations for a treaty of general arbitration for all differences\r\nbetween Great Britain and the United States are far advanced and promise\r\nto reach a successful consummation at an early date.\r\n\r\nThe scheme of examining applicants for certain consular positions to\r\ntest their competency and fitness, adopted under an Executive order\r\nissued on the 20th of September, 1895,[36] has fully demonstrated the\r\nusefulness of this innovation. In connection with this plan of\r\nexamination promotions and transfers of deserving incumbents have been\r\nquite extensively made, with excellent results.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year 35 appointments have been made in the consular\r\nservice, 27 of which were made to fill vacancies caused by death or\r\nresignation or to supply newly created posts, 2 to succeed incumbents\r\nremoved for cause, 2 for the purpose of displacing alien consular\r\nofficials by American citizens, and 4 merely changing the official\r\ntitle of incumbent from commercial agent to consul. Twelve of these\r\nappointments were transfers or promotions from other positions under the\r\nDepartment of State, 4 of those appointed had rendered previous service\r\nunder the Department, 8 were made of persons who passed a satisfactory\r\nexamination, 7 were appointed to places not included in the order of\r\nSeptember 20, 1895, and 4 appointments, as above stated, involved no\r\nchange of incumbency.\r\n\r\nThe inspection of consular offices provided for by an appropriation for\r\nthat purpose at the last session of the Congress has been productive\r\nof such wholesome effects that I hope this important work will in the\r\nfuture be continued. I know of nothing that can be done with the same\r\nslight expense so improving to the service.\r\n\r\nI desire to repeat the recommendation contained in my last annual\r\nmessage in favor of providing at public expense official residences\r\nfor our ambassadors and ministers at foreign capitals. The reasons\r\nsupporting this recommendation are strongly stated in the report of the\r\nSecretary of State, and the subject seems of such importance that I hope\r\nit may receive the early attention of the Congress.\r\n\r\nWe have during the last year labored faithfully and against unfavorable\r\nconditions to secure better preservation of seal life in the Bering Sea.\r\nBoth the United States and Great Britain have lately dispatched\r\ncommissioners to these waters to study the habits and condition of the\r\nseal herd and the causes of their rapid decrease. Upon the reports of\r\nthese commissioners, soon to be submitted, and with the exercise of\r\npatience and good sense on the part of all interested parties, it is\r\nearnestly hoped that hearty cooperation may be secured for the\r\nprotection against threatened extinction of seal life in the Northern\r\nPacific and Bering Sea.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Treasury reports that during the fiscal year ended\r\nJune 30, 1896, the receipts of the Government from all sources amounted\r\nto $409,475,408.78. During the same period its expenditures were\r\n$434,678,654.48, the excess of expenditures over receipts thus amounting\r\nto $25,203,245.70. The ordinary expenditures during the year were\r\n$4,015,852.21 less than during the preceding fiscal year. Of the\r\nreceipts mentioned there was derived from customs the sum of\r\n$160,021,751.67 and from internal revenue $146,830,615.66. The receipts\r\nfrom customs show an increase of $7,863,134.22 over those from the same\r\nsource for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1895, and the receipts from\r\ninternal revenue an increase of $3,584,537.91.\r\n\r\nThe value of our imported dutiable merchandise during the last fiscal\r\nyear was $369,757,470 and the value of free goods imported $409,967,470,\r\nbeing an increase of $6,523,675 in the value of dutiable goods and\r\n$41,231,034 in the value of free goods over the preceding year. Our\r\nexports of merchandise, foreign and domestic, amounted in value to\r\n$882,606,938, being an increase over the preceding year of $75,068,773.\r\nThe average _ad valorem_ duty paid on dutiable goods imported\r\nduring the year was 39.94 per cent and on free and dutiable goods taken\r\ntogether 20.55 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe cost of collecting our internal revenue was 2.78 percent, as\r\nagainst 2.81 per cent for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1895. The\r\ntotal production of distilled spirits, exclusive of fruit brandies, was\r\n86,588,703 taxable gallons, being an increase of 6,639,108 gallons over\r\nthe preceding year. There was also an increase of 1,443,676 gallons of\r\nspirits produced from fruit as compared with the preceding year. The\r\nnumber of barrels of beer produced was 35,859,250, as against 33,589,784\r\nproduced in the preceding fiscal year, being an increase of 2,269,466\r\nbarrels.\r\n\r\nThe total amount of gold exported during the last fiscal year was\r\n$112,409,947 and of silver $60,541,670, being an increase of $45,941,466\r\nof gold and $13,246,384 of silver over the exportations of the preceding\r\nfiscal year. The imports of gold were $33,525,065 and of silver\r\n$28,777,186, being $2,859,695 less of gold and $8,566,007 more of silver\r\nthan during the preceding year.\r\n\r\nThe total stock of metallic money in the United States at the close\r\nof the last fiscal year, ended on the 30th day of June, 1896, was\r\n$1,228,326,035, of which $599,597,964 was in gold and $628,728,071\r\nin silver.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st day of November, 1896, the total stock of money of all kinds\r\nin the country was $2,285,410,590, and the amount in circulation, not\r\nincluding that in the Treasury holdings, was $1,627,055,641, being\r\n$22.63 Per capita upon an estimated population of 71,902,000.\r\n\r\nThe production of the precious metals in the United States during the\r\ncalendar year 1895 is estimated to have been 2,254,760 fine ounces of\r\ngold, of the value of $46,610,000, and 55,727,000 fine ounces of silver,\r\nof the commercial value of $36,445,000 and the coinage value of\r\n$72,051,000. The estimated production of these metals throughout the\r\nworld during the same period was 9,688,821 fine ounces of gold,\r\namounting to $200,285,700 in value, and 169,189,249 fine ounces of\r\nsilver, of the commercial value of $110,654,000 and of the coinage value\r\nof $218,738,100 according to our ratio.\r\n\r\nThe coinage of these metals in the various countries of the world during\r\nthe same calendar year amounted to $232,701,438 in gold and $121,996,219\r\nin silver.\r\n\r\nThe total coinage at the mints of the United States during the fiscal\r\nyear ended June 30, 1896, amounted to $71,188,468.52, of which\r\n$58,878,490 was in gold coins and $12,309,978.52 in standard silver\r\ndollars, subsidiary coins, and minor coins.\r\n\r\nThe number of national banks organized from the time the law authorizing\r\ntheir creation was passed up to October 31, 1896, was 5,051, and of\r\nthis number 3,679 were at the date last mentioned in active operation,\r\nhaving authorized capital stock of $650,014,895, held by 288,902\r\nshareholders, and circulating notes amounting to $211,412,620.\r\n\r\nThe total outstanding circulating notes of all national banks on\r\nthe 31st day of October, 1896, amounted to $234,553,807, including\r\nunredeemed but fully secured notes of banks insolvent and in process\r\nof liquidation. The increase in national-bank circulation during the\r\nyear ending on that day was $21,099,429. On October 6, 1896, when the\r\ncondition of national banks was last reported, the total resources of\r\nthe 3,679 active institutions were $3,263,685,313.83, which included\r\n$1,893,268,839.31 in loans and discounts and $362,165,733.85 in money\r\nof all kinds on hand. Of their liabilities $1,597,891,058.03 was due\r\nto individual depositors and $209,944,019 consisted of outstanding\r\ncirculating notes.\r\n\r\nThere were organized during the year preceding the date last mentioned\r\n28 national banks, located in 15 States, of which 12 were organized in\r\nthe Eastern States, with a capital of $1,180,000, 6 in the Western\r\nStates, with a capital of $875,000, and 10 in the Southern States, with\r\na capital of $1,190,000. During the year, however, 37 banks voluntarily\r\nabandoned their franchises under the national law, and in the case of\r\n27 others it was found necessary to appoint receivers. Therefore, as\r\ncompared with the year preceding, there was a decrease of 36 in the\r\nnumber of active banks.\r\n\r\nThe number of existing banks organized under State laws is 5,708.\r\n\r\nThe number of immigrants arriving in the United States during the fiscal\r\nyear was 343,267, of whom 340,468 were permitted to land and 2,799 were\r\ndebarred on various grounds prescribed by law and returned to the\r\ncountries whence they came at the expense of the steamship companies\r\nby which they were brought in. The increase in immigration over the\r\npreceding year amounted to 84,731. It is reported that with some\r\nexceptions the immigrants of the past year were of a hardy laboring\r\nclass, accustomed and able to earn a support for themselves, and it\r\nis estimated that the money brought with them amounted to at least\r\n$5,000,000, though it was probably much in excess of that sum, since\r\nonly those having less than $30 are required to disclose the exact\r\namount, and it is known that many brought considerable sums of money to\r\nbuy land and build homes. Including all the immigrants arriving who were\r\nover 14 years of age, 28.63 Per cent were illiterate, as against 20.37\r\nPer cent of those of that age arriving during the preceding fiscal year.\r\nThe number of immigrants over 14 years old, the countries from which\r\nthey came, and the percentage of illiterates among them were as follows:\r\nItaly, 57,515, with 54.59 per cent; Ireland, 37,496, with 7 per cent;\r\nRussia, 35,188, with 41.14 per cent; Austria-Hungary and provinces,\r\n57,053, with 38.92 per cent; Germany, 25,334, with 2.96 per cent;\r\nSweden, 18,821, with 1.16 per cent; while from Portugal there came\r\n2,067, of whom 77.69 per cent were illiterate. There arrived from Japan\r\nduring the year only 1,100 immigrants, and it is the opinion of the\r\nimmigration authorities that the apprehension heretofore existing to\r\nsome extent of a large immigration from Japan to the United States is\r\nwithout any substantial foundation.\r\n\r\nFrom the Life-Saving Service it is reported that the number of disasters\r\nto documented vessels within the limits of its operations during the\r\nyear was 437. These vessels had on board 4,608 persons, of whom 4,595\r\nwere saved and 13 lost. The value of such vessels is estimated at\r\n$8,880,140 and of their cargoes $3,846,380, making the total value of\r\nproperty imperiled $12,726,520. Of this amount $11,292,707 was saved and\r\n$1,432,750 was lost. Sixty-seven of the vessels were totally wrecked.\r\nThere were besides 243 casualties to small undocumented craft, on board\r\nof which there were 594 persons, of whom 587 were saved and 7 were lost.\r\nThe value of the property involved in these latter casualties is\r\nestimated at $119,265, of which $114,915 was saved and $4,350 was lost.\r\nThe life-saving crews during the year also rescued or assisted numerous\r\nother vessels and warned many from danger by signals, both by day and\r\nnight. The number of disasters during the year exceeded that of any\r\nprevious year in the history of the service, but the saving of both life\r\nand property was greater than ever before in proportion to the value of\r\nthe property involved and to the number of persons imperiled.\r\n\r\nThe operations of the Marine-Hospital Service, the Revenue Cutter\r\nService, the Steamboat-Inspection Service, the Light-House Service, the\r\nBureau of Navigation, and other branches of public work attached to the\r\nTreasury Department, together with various recommendations concerning\r\ntheir support and improvement, are fully stated in the report of the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, to which the attention of the Congress is\r\nespecially invited.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of War exhibits satisfactory conditions in\r\nthe several branches of the public service intrusted to his charge.\r\n\r\nThe limit of our military force as fixed by law is constantly and\r\nreadily maintained. The present discipline and morale of our Army are\r\nexcellent, and marked progress and efficiency are apparent throughout\r\nits entire organization.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of delicate duties in the suppression of slight\r\nIndian disturbances along our southwestern boundary, in which the\r\nMexican troops cooperated, and the compulsory but peaceful return, with\r\nthe consent of Great Britain, of a band of Cree Indians from Montana to\r\nthe British possessions, no active operations have been required of the\r\nArmy during the year past.\r\n\r\nChanges in methods of administration, the abandonment of unnecessary\r\nposts and consequent concentration of troops, and the exercise of care\r\nand vigilance by the various officers charged with the responsibility\r\nin the expenditure of the appropriations have resulted in reducing to\r\na minimum the cost of maintenance of our military establishment.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year the work of constructing permanent infantry and\r\ncavalry posts has been continued at the places heretofore designated.\r\nThe Secretary of War repeats his recommendation that appropriations for\r\nbarracks and quarters should more strictly conform to the needs of the\r\nservice as judged by the Department rather than respond to the wishes\r\nand importunities of localities. It is imperative that much of the money\r\nprovided for such construction should now be allotted to the erection\r\nof necessary quarters for the garrisons assigned to the coast defenses,\r\nwhere many men will be needed to properly care for and operate modern\r\nguns. It is essential, too, that early provision be made to supply the\r\nnecessary force of artillery to meet the demands of this service.\r\n\r\nThe entire Army has now been equipped with the new magazine arms, and\r\nwise policy demands that all available public and private resources\r\nshould be so employed as to provide within a reasonable time a\r\nsufficient number to supply the State militia with these modern weapons\r\nand provide an ample reserve for any emergency.\r\n\r\nThe organized militia numbers 112,879 men. The appropriations for its\r\nsupport by the several States approximate $2,800,000 annually, and\r\n$400,000 is contributed by the General Government. Investigation shows\r\nthese troops to be usually well drilled and inspired with much military\r\ninterest, but in many instances they are so deficient in proper arms and\r\nequipment that a sudden call to active duty would find them inadequately\r\nprepared for field service. I therefore recommend that prompt measures\r\nbe taken to remedy this condition and that every encouragement be given\r\nto this deserving body of unpaid and voluntary citizen soldiers, upon\r\nwhose assistance we must largely rely in time of trouble.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year rapid progress has been made toward the completion\r\nof the scheme adopted for the erection and armament of fortifications\r\nalong our seacoast, while equal progress has been made in providing the\r\nmaterial for submarine defense in connection with these works.\r\n\r\nIt is peculiarly gratifying at this time to note the great advance that\r\nhas been made in this important undertaking since the date of my annual\r\nmessage to the Fifty-third Congress at the opening of its second\r\nsession, in December, 1893. At that time I informed the Congress of the\r\napproaching completion of nine 12-inch, twenty 10-inch, and thirty-four\r\n8-inch high-power steel guns and seventy-five 12-inch rifled mortars.\r\n\r\nThis total then seemed insignificant when compared with the great work\r\nremaining to be done. Yet it was none the less a source of satisfaction\r\nto every citizen when he reflected that it represented the first\r\ninstallment of the new ordnance of American design and American\r\nmanufacture and demonstrated our ability to supply from our own\r\nresources guns of unexcelled power and accuracy.\r\n\r\nAt that date, however, there were practically no carriages upon which\r\nto mount these guns and only thirty-one emplacements for guns and\r\nsixty-four for mortars. Nor were all these emplacements in condition\r\nto receive their armament. Only one high-power gun was at that time in\r\nposition for the defense of the entire coast.\r\n\r\nSince that time the number of guns actually completed has been increased\r\nto a total of twenty-one 12-inch, fifty-six 10-inch, sixty-one 8-inch\r\nhigh-power breech-loading steel guns, ten rapid-fire guns, and eighty\r\n12-inch rifled mortars. In addition there are in process of construction\r\none 16-inch-type gun, fifty 12-inch, fifty-six l0-inch, twenty-seven\r\n8-inch high-power guns, and sixty-six 12-inch rifled mortars; in all,\r\nfour hundred and twenty-eight guns and mortars.\r\n\r\nDuring the same year, immediately preceding the message referred to, the\r\nfirst modern gun carriage had been completed and eleven more were in\r\nprocess of construction. All but one were of the nondisappearing type.\r\nThese, however, were not such as to secure necessary cover for the\r\nartillery gunners against the intense fire of modern machine rapid-fire\r\nand high-power guns.\r\n\r\nThe inventive genius of ordnance and civilian experts has been taxed\r\nin designing carriages that would obviate this fault, resulting, it is\r\nbelieved, in the solution of this difficult problem. Since 1893 the\r\nnumber of gun carriages constructed or building has been raised to a\r\ntotal of 129, of which 90 are on the disappearing principle, and the\r\nnumber of mortar carriages to 152, while the 95 emplacements which were\r\nprovided for prior to that time have been increased to 280 built and\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nThis improved situation is largely due to the recent generous response\r\nof Congress to the recommendations of the War Department.\r\n\r\nThus we shall soon have complete about one-fifth of the comprehensive\r\nsystem the first step in which was noted in my message to the Congress\r\nof December 4, 1893.[37]\r\n\r\nWhen it is understood that a masonry emplacement not only furnishes\r\na platform for the heavy modern high power gun, but also in every\r\nparticular serves the purpose and takes the place of the fort of former\r\ndays, the importance of the work accomplished is better comprehended.\r\n\r\nIn the hope that the work will be prosecuted with no less vigor in the\r\nfuture, the Secretary of War has submitted an estimate by which, if\r\nallowed, there will be provided and either built or building by the end\r\nof the next fiscal year such additional guns, mortars, gun carriages,\r\nand emplacements as will represent not far from one-third of the total\r\nwork to be done under the plan adopted for our coast defenses, thus\r\naffording a prospect that the entire work will be substantially\r\ncompleted within six years. In less time than that, however, we shall\r\nhave attained a marked degree of security.\r\n\r\nThe experience and results of the past year demonstrate that with a\r\ncontinuation of present careful methods the cost of the remaining work\r\nwill be much less than the original estimate.\r\n\r\nWe should always keep in mind that of all forms of military preparation\r\ncoast defense alone is essentially pacific in its nature. While it gives\r\nthe sense of security due to a consciousness of strength, it is neither\r\nthe purpose nor the effect of such permanent fortifications to involve\r\nus in foreign complications, but rather to guarantee us against them.\r\nThey are not temptation to war, but security against it. Thus they are\r\nthoroughly in accord with all the traditions of our national diplomacy.\r\n\r\nThe Attorney-General presents a detailed and interesting statement of\r\nthe important work done under his supervision during the last fiscal\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThe ownership and management by the Government of penitentiaries for\r\nthe confinement of those convicted in United States courts of violations\r\nof Federal laws, which for many years has been a subject of Executive\r\nrecommendation, have at last to a slight extent been realized by the\r\nutilization of the abandoned military prison at Fort Leavenworth as a\r\nUnited States penitentiary.\r\n\r\nThis is certainly a movement in the right direction, but it ought to be\r\nat once supplemented by the rebuilding or extensive enlargement of this\r\nimprovised prison and the construction of at least one more, to be\r\nlocated in the Southern States. The capacity of the Leavenworth\r\nPenitentiary is so limited that the expense of its maintenance,\r\ncalculated at a per capita rate upon the number of prisoners it can\r\naccommodate, does not make as economical an exhibit as it would if it\r\nwere larger and better adapted to prison purposes; but I am thoroughly\r\nconvinced that economy, humanity, and a proper sense of responsibility\r\nand duty toward those whom we punish for violations of Federal law\r\ndictate that the Federal Government should have the entire control and\r\nmanagement of the penitentiaries where convicted violators are confined.\r\n\r\nIt appears that since the transfer of the Fort Leavenworth Military\r\nPrison to its new uses the work previously done by prisoners confined\r\nthere, and for which expensive machinery has been provided, has been\r\ndiscontinued. This work consisted of the manufacture of articles for\r\narmy use, now done elsewhere. On all grounds it is exceedingly desirable\r\nthat the convicts confined in this penitentiary be allowed to resume\r\nwork of this description.\r\n\r\nIt is most gratifying to note the satisfactory results that have\r\nfollowed the inauguration of the new system provided for by the act of\r\nMay 28, 1896, under which certain Federal officials are compensated by\r\nsalaries instead of fees. The new plan was put in operation on the 1st\r\nday of July, 1896, and already the great economy it enforces, its\r\nprevention of abuses, and its tendency to a better enforcement of the\r\nlaws are strikingly apparent. Detailed evidence of the usefulness of\r\nthis long-delayed but now happily accomplished reform will be found\r\nclearly set forth in the Attorney-General's report.\r\n\r\nOur Post-Office Department is in good condition, and the exhibit\r\nmade of its operations during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1896,\r\nif allowance is made for imperfections in the laws applicable to\r\nit, is very satisfactory. The total receipts during the year were\r\n$82,499,208.40. The total expenditures were $90,626,296.84, exclusive\r\nof the $1,559,898.27 which was earned by the Pacific Railroad for\r\ntransportation and credited on their debt to the Government. There was\r\nan increase of receipts over the previous year of $5,516,080.21, or 7.1\r\nper cent, and an increase of expenditures of $3,836,124.02, or 4.42\r\npercent. The deficit was $1,679,956.19 less than that of the preceding\r\nyear. The chief expenditures of the postal service are regulated by law\r\nand are not in the control of the Postmaster-General. All that he can\r\naccomplish by the most watchful administration and economy is to enforce\r\nprompt and thorough collection and accounting for public moneys and such\r\nminor savings in small expenditures and in letting those contracts, for\r\npost-office supplies and star service, which are not regulated by\r\nstatute.\r\n\r\nAn effective cooperation between the Auditor's Office and the\r\nPost-Office Department and the making and enforcement of orders by\r\nthe Department requiring immediate notification to their sureties\r\nof all delinquencies on the part of postmasters, and compelling such\r\npostmasters to make more frequent deposits of postal funds, have\r\nresulted in a prompter auditing of their accounts and much less default\r\nto the Government than heretofore.\r\n\r\nThe year's report shows large extensions of both star-route service and\r\nrailway mail service, with increased postal facilities. Much higher\r\naccuracy in handling mails has also been reached, as appears by the\r\ndecrease of errors in the railway mail service and the reduction of mail\r\nmatter returned to the Dead-Letter Office.\r\n\r\nThe deficit for the last year, although much less than that of the last\r\nand preceding years, emphasizes the necessity for legislation to correct\r\nthe growing abuse of second-class rates, to which the deficiency is\r\nmainly attributable. The transmission at the rate of 1 cent a pound of\r\nserial libraries, advertising sheets, \"house organs\" (periodicals\r\nadvertising some particular \"house\" or institution), sample copies, and\r\nthe like ought certainly to be discontinued. A glance at the revenues\r\nreceived for the work done last year will show more plainly than any\r\nother statement the gross abuse of the postal service and the growing\r\nwaste of its earnings.\r\n\r\nThe free matter carried in the mails for the Departments, offices, etc.,\r\nof the Government and for Congress, in pounds, amounted to 94,480,189.\r\n\r\nIf this is offset against buildings for post-offices and stations, the\r\nrental of which would more than compensate for such free postal service,\r\nwe have this exhibit:\r\n\r\n_Weight of mail matter (other than above) transmitted through the\r\nmails for the year ending June 30, 1896_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  ---------------------------------------+--------------+---------------+\r\n                 Class.                  |   Weight.    |    Revenue.   |\r\n  ---------------------------------------+--------------+---------------+\r\n                                         |_Pounds._|               |\r\n  1.

It thus appears that though the\r\nsecond-class matter constituted more than two-thirds of the total that\r\nwas carried, the revenue derived from it was less than one-thirtieth of\r\nthe total expense.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The average revenue was--\r\n\r\n  From each pound of first-class matter                 cents   93.0\r\n  From each pound of second class[38]                   mills    8.5\r\n  From each pound of third class                        cents   13.1\r\n  From each pound of fourth class                         do    15.6\r\n\r\n\r\nThe growth in weight of second-class matter has been from 299,000,000\r\npounds in 1894 to 312,000,000 in 1895 and to almost 349,000,000 in 1896,\r\nand it is quite evident this increasing drawback is far outstripping any\r\npossible growth of postal revenues.\r\n\r\nOur mail service should of course be such as to meet the wants and even\r\nthe conveniences of our people at a direct charge upon them so light\r\nas perhaps to exclude the idea of our Post-Office Department being\r\na money-making concern; but in the face of a constantly recurring\r\ndeficiency in its revenues and in view of the fact that we supply the\r\nbest mail service in the world it seems to me it is quite time to\r\ncorrect the abuses that swell enormously our annual deficit. If we\r\nconcede the public policy of carrying weekly newspapers free in the\r\ncounty of publication, and even the policy of carrying at less than\r\none-tenth of their cost other _bona fide_ newspapers and periodicals,\r\nthere can be no excuse for subjecting the service to the further immense\r\nand increasing loss involved in carrying at the nominal rate of 1 cent a\r\npound the serial libraries, sometimes including trashy and even harmful\r\nliterature, and other matter which under the loose interpretation of\r\na loose statute have been gradually given second-class rates, thus\r\nabsorbing all profitable returns derived from first-class matter, which\r\npays three or four times more than its cost, and producing a large\r\nannual loss to be paid by general taxation. If such second-class matter\r\npaid merely the cost of its handling, our deficit would disappear and\r\na surplus result which might be used to give the people still better\r\nmail facilities or cheaper rates of letter postage. I recommend that\r\nlegislation be at once enacted to correct these abuses and introduce\r\nbetter business ideas in the regulation of our postal rates.\r\n\r\nExperience and observation have demonstrated that certain improvements\r\nin the organization of the Post-Office Department must be secured before\r\nwe can gain the full benefit of the immense sums expended in its\r\nadministration. This involves the following reforms, which I earnestly\r\nrecommend:\r\n\r\nThere should be a small addition to the existing inspector service,\r\nto be employed in the supervision of the carrier force, which now\r\nnumbers 13,000 men and performs its service practically without the\r\nsurveillance exercised over all other branches of the postal or public\r\nservice. Of course such a lack of supervision and freedom from wholesome\r\ndisciplinary restraints must inevitably lead to imperfect service. There\r\nshould also be appointed a few inspectors who could assist the central\r\noffice in necessary investigation concerning matters of post-office\r\nleases, post-office sites, allowances for rent, fuel, and lights, and\r\nin organizing and securing the best results from the work of the 14,000\r\nclerks now employed in first and second class offices.\r\n\r\nI am convinced that the small expense attending the inauguration of\r\nthese reforms would actually be a profitable investment.\r\n\r\nI especially recommend such a recasting of the appropriations\r\nby Congress for the Post-Office Department as will permit the\r\nPostmaster-General to proceed with the work of consolidating\r\npost-offices. This work has already been entered upon sufficiently to\r\nfully demonstrate by experiment and experience that such consolidation\r\nis productive of better service, larger revenues, and less expenditures,\r\nto say nothing of the further advantage of gradually withdrawing\r\npost-offices from the spoils system.\r\n\r\nThe Universal Postal Union, which now embraces all the civilized world\r\nand whose delegates will represent 1,000,000,000 people, will hold its\r\nfifth congress in the city of Washington in May, 1897. The United States\r\nmay be said to have taken the initiative which led to the first meeting\r\nof this congress, at Berne in 1874, and the formation of the Universal\r\nPostal Union, which brings the postal service of all countries to every\r\nman's neighborhood and has wrought marvels in cheapening postal rates\r\nand securing absolutely safe mail communication throughout the world.\r\nPrevious congresses have met in Berne, Paris, Lisbon, and Vienna, and\r\nthe respective countries in which they have assembled have made generous\r\nprovision for their accommodation and for the reception and\r\nentertainment of the delegates.\r\n\r\nIn view of the importance of this assemblage and of its deliberations\r\nand of the honors and hospitalities accorded to our representatives by\r\nother countries on similar occasions, I earnestly hope that such an\r\nappropriation will be made for the expenses necessarily attendant upon\r\nthe coming meeting in our capital city as will be worthy of our national\r\nhospitality and indicative of our appreciation of the event.\r\n\r\nThe work of the Navy Department and its present condition are fully\r\nexhibited in the report of the Secretary.\r\n\r\nThe construction of vessels for our new Navy has been energetically,\r\nprosecuted by the present Administration upon the general lines\r\npreviously adopted, the Department having seen no necessity for radical\r\nchanges in prior methods, under which the work was found to be\r\nprogressing in a manner highly satisfactory. It has been decided,\r\nhowever, to provide in every shipbuilding contract that the builder\r\nshould pay all trial expenses, and it has also been determined to pay no\r\nspeed premiums in future contracts. The premiums recently earned and\r\nsome yet to be decided are features of the contracts made before this\r\nconclusion was reached.\r\n\r\nOn March 4, 1893, there were in commission but two armored vessels--the\r\ndouble-turreted monitors _Miantonomoh_ and _Monterey_. Since\r\nthat date, of vessels theretofore authorized, there have been placed in\r\ntheir first commission 3 first-class and 2 second-class battle ships, 2\r\narmored cruisers, 1 harbor-defense ram, and 5 double-turreted monitors,\r\nincluding the _Maine_ and the _Puritan_, just completed. Eight\r\nnew unarmored cruisers and 2 new gunboats have also been commissioned.\r\nThe _Iowa_, another battle ship, will be completed about March 1,\r\nand at least 4 more gunboats will be ready for sea in the early spring.\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to state that our ships and their outfits are believed\r\nto be equal to the best that can be manufactured elsewhere, and that\r\nsuch notable reductions have been made in their cost as to justify the\r\nstatement that quite a number of vessels are now being constructed at\r\nrates as low as those that prevail in European shipyards.\r\n\r\nOur manufacturing facilities are at this time ample for all possible\r\nnaval contingencies. Three of our Government navy-yards--those at\r\nMare Island, Cal., Norfolk, Va., and Brooklyn, N.Y.--are equipped for\r\nshipbuilding, our ordnance plant in Washington is equal to any in\r\nthe world, and at the torpedo station we are successfully making the\r\nhighest grades of smokeless powder. The first-class private shipyards\r\nat Newport News, Philadelphia, and San Francisco are building battle\r\nships; eleven contractors, situated in the States of Maine, Rhode\r\nIsland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, and the State\r\nof Washington, are constructing gunboats or torpedo boats; two plants\r\nare manufacturing large quantities of first-class armor, and American\r\nfactories are producing automobile torpedoes, powder, projectiles,\r\nrapid-fire guns, and everything else necessary for the complete outfit\r\nof naval vessels.\r\n\r\nThere have been authorized by Congress since March, 1893, 5 battle\r\nships, 6 light-draft gunboats, 16 torpedo boats, and 1 submarine torpedo\r\nboat. Contracts for the building of all of them have been let. The\r\nSecretary expresses the opinion that we have for the present a\r\nsufficient supply of cruisers and gunboats, and that hereafter the\r\nconstruction of battle ships and torpedo boats will supply our needs.\r\n\r\nMuch attention has been given to the methods of carrying on departmental\r\nbusiness. Important modifications in the regulations have been made,\r\ntending to unify the control of shipbuilding as far as may be under the\r\nBureau of Construction and Repair, and also to improve the mode of\r\npurchasing supplies for the Navy by the Bureau of Supplies and Accounts.\r\nThe establishment under recent acts of Congress of a supply fund with\r\nwhich to purchase these supplies in large quantities and other\r\nmodifications of methods have tended materially to their cheapening and\r\nbetter quality.\r\n\r\nThe War College has developed into an institution which it is believed\r\nwill be of great value to the Navy in teaching the science of war, as\r\nwell as in stimulating professional zeal in the Navy, and it will be\r\nespecially useful in the devising of plans for the utilization in case\r\nof necessity of all the naval resources of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary has persistently adhered to the plan he found in operation\r\nfor securing labor at navy-yards through boards of labor employment, and\r\nhas done much to make it more complete and efficient. The naval officers\r\nwho are familiar with this system and its operation express the decided\r\nopinion that its results have been to vastly improve the character of\r\nthe work done at our yards and greatly reduce its cost.\r\n\r\nDiscipline among the officers and men of the Navy has been maintained\r\nto a high standard and the percentage of American citizens enlisted has\r\nbeen very much increased.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary is considering and will formulate during the coming winter\r\na plan for laying up ships in reserve, thereby largely reducing the cost\r\nof maintaining our vessels afloat. This plan contemplates that battle\r\nships, torpedo boats, and such of the cruisers as are not needed for\r\nactive service at sea shall be kept in reserve with skeleton crews on\r\nboard to keep them in condition, cruising only enough to insure the\r\nefficiency of the ships and their crews in time of activity.\r\n\r\nThe economy to result from this system is too obvious to need comment.\r\n\r\nThe Naval Militia, which was authorized a few years ago as an\r\nexperiment, has now developed into a body of enterprising young men,\r\nactive and energetic in the discharge of their duties and promising\r\ngreat usefulness. This establishment has nearly the same relation to our\r\nNavy as the National Guard in the different States bears to our Army,\r\nand it constitutes a source of supply for our naval forces the\r\nimportance of which is immediately apparent.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Interior presents a comprehensive and\r\ninteresting exhibit of the numerous and important affairs committed to\r\nhis supervision. It is impossible in this communication to do more than\r\nbriefly refer to a few of the subjects concerning which the Secretary\r\ngives full and instructive information.\r\n\r\nThe money appropriated on account of this Department and for its\r\ndisbursement for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1896, amounted to more\r\nthan $157,000,000, or a greater sum than was appropriated for the entire\r\nmaintenance of the Government for the two fiscal years ended June 30,\r\n1861.\r\n\r\nOur public lands, originally amounting to 1,840,000,000 acres, have been\r\nso reduced that only about 600,000,000 acres still remain in Government\r\ncontrol, excluding Alaska. The balance, being by far the most valuable\r\nportion, has been given away to settlers, to new States, and to\r\nrailroads or sold at a comparatively nominal sum. The patenting of land\r\nin execution of railroad grants has progressed rapidly during the\r\nyear, and since the 4th day of March, 1893, about 25,000,000 acres have\r\nthus been conveyed to these corporations.\r\n\r\nI agree with the Secretary that the remainder of our public lands should\r\nbe more carefully dealt with and their alienation guarded by better\r\neconomy and greater prudence.\r\n\r\nThe commission appointed from the membership of the National Academy of\r\nSciences, provided for by an act of Congress, to formulate plans for a\r\nnational forestry system will, it is hoped, soon be prepared to present\r\nthe result of thorough and intelligent examination of this important\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nThe total Indian population of the United States is 177,235, according\r\nto a census made in 1895, exclusive of those within the State of New\r\nYork and those comprising the Five Civilized Tribes. Of this number\r\nthere are approximately 38,000 children of school age. During the year\r\n23,393 of these were enrolled in schools. The progress which has\r\nattended recent efforts to extend Indian-school facilities and the\r\nanticipation of continued liberal appropriations to that end can not\r\nfail to afford the utmost satisfaction to those who believe that the\r\neducation of Indian children is a prime factor in the accomplishment of\r\nIndian civilization.\r\n\r\nIt may be said in general terms that in every particular the improvement\r\nof the Indians under Government care has been most marked and\r\nencouraging.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, and the agents having\r\ncharge of Indians to whom allotments have been made strongly urge the\r\npassage of a law prohibiting the sale of liquor to allottees who have\r\ntaken their lands in severalty. I earnestly join in this recommendation\r\nand venture to express the hope that the Indian may be speedily\r\nprotected against this greatest of all obstacles to his well-being and\r\nadvancement.\r\n\r\nThe condition of affairs among the Five Civilized Tribes, who occupy\r\nlarge tracts of land in the Indian Territory and who have governments\r\nof their own, has assumed such an aspect as to render it almost\r\nindispensable that there should be an entire change in the relations of\r\nthese Indians to the General Government. This seems to be necessary in\r\nfurtherance of their own interests, as well as for the protection of\r\nnon-Indian residents in their territory. A commission organized and\r\nempowered under several recent laws is now negotiating with these\r\nIndians for the relinquishment of their courts and the division of their\r\ncommon lands in severalty and are aiding in the settlement of the\r\ntroublesome question of tribal membership. The reception of their first\r\nproffers of negotiation was not encouraging, but through patience and\r\nsuch conduct on their part as demonstrated that their intentions were\r\nfriendly and in the interest of the tribes the prospect of success has\r\nbecome more promising. The effort should be to save these Indians from\r\nthe consequences of their own mistakes and improvidence and to secure to\r\nthe real Indian his rights as against intruders and professed friends\r\nwho profit by his retrogression. A change is also needed to protect life\r\nand property through the operation of courts conducted according to\r\nstrict justice and strong enough to enforce their mandates.\r\n\r\nAs a sincere friend of the Indian, I am exceedingly anxious that\r\nthese reforms should be accomplished with the consent and aid of the\r\ntribes and that no necessity may be presented for radical or drastic\r\nlegislation. I hope, therefore, that the commission now conducting\r\nnegotiations will soon be able to report that progress has been made\r\ntoward a friendly adjustment of existing difficulties.\r\n\r\nIt appears that a very valuable deposit of gilsonite or asphaltum has\r\nbeen found on the reservation in Utah occupied by the Uncompahgre Ute\r\nIndians. Every consideration of care for the public interest and every\r\nsensible business reason dictate such management or disposal of this\r\nimportant source of public revenue as will except it from the general\r\nrules and incidents attending the ordinary disposition of public lands\r\nand secure to the Government a fair share at least of its advantages in\r\nplace of its transfer for a nominal sum to interested individuals.\r\n\r\nI indorse the recommendation made by the present Secretary of the\r\nInterior, as well as his predecessor, that a permanent commission,\r\nconsisting of three members, one of whom shall be an army officer, be\r\ncreated to perform the duties now devolving upon the Commissioner and\r\nAssistant Commissioner of Indian Affairs. The management of the Bureau\r\ninvolves such numerous and diverse details and the advantages of an\r\nuninterrupted policy are so apparent that I hope the change suggested\r\nwill meet the approval of the Congress.\r\n\r\nThe diminution of our enormous pension roll and the decrease of pension\r\nexpenditure, which have been so often confidently foretold, still fail\r\nin material realization. The number of pensioners on the rolls at the\r\nclose of the fiscal year ended June 30, 1896, was 970,678. This is the\r\nlargest number ever reported. The amount paid exclusively for pensions\r\nduring the year was $138,214,761.94, a slight decrease from that of the\r\npreceding year, while the total expenditures on account of pensions,\r\nincluding the cost of maintaining the Department and expenses attending\r\npension distribution, amounted to $142,206,550.59, or within a very\r\nsmall fraction of one third of the entire expense of supporting the\r\nGovernment during the same year. The number of new pension certificates\r\nissued was 90,640. Of these, 40,374 represent original allowances of\r\nclaims and 15,878 increases of existing pensions.\r\n\r\nThe number of persons receiving pensions from the United States, but\r\nresiding in foreign countries, at the close of the last fiscal year was\r\n3,781, and the amount paid to them during the year was $582,735.38.\r\n\r\nThe sum appropriated for the payment of pensions for the current fiscal\r\nyear, ending June 30, 1897, is $140,000,000, and for the succeeding year\r\nit is estimated that the same amount will be necessary.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner of Pensions reports that during the last fiscal year\r\n339 indictments were found against violators of the pension laws. Upon\r\nthese indictments 167 convictions resulted.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, based upon such statements as these and much other\r\ninformation and observation, the abuses which have been allowed to creep\r\ninto our pension system have done incalculable harm in demoralizing our\r\npeople and undermining good citizenship. I have endeavored within my\r\nsphere of official duty to protect our pension roll and make it what it\r\nshould be, a roll of honor, containing the names of those disabled in\r\ntheir country's service and worthy of their country's affectionate\r\nremembrance. When I have seen those who pose as the soldiers' friends\r\nactive and alert in urging greater laxity and more reckless pension\r\nexpenditure, while nursing selfish schemes, I have deprecated the\r\napproach of a situation when necessary retrenchment and enforced economy\r\nmay lead to an attack upon pension abuses so determined as to overlook\r\nthe discrimination due to those who, worthy of a nation's care, ought to\r\nlive and die under the protection of a nation's gratitude.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary calls attention to the public interests involved in an\r\nadjustment of the obligations of the Pacific railroads to the\r\nGovernment. I deem it to be an important duty to especially present this\r\nsubject to the consideration of the Congress.\r\n\r\nOn January 1, 1897, with the amount already matured, more than\r\n$13,000,000 of the principal of the subsidy bonds issued by the United\r\nStates in aid of the construction of the Union Pacific Railway,\r\nincluding its Kansas line, and more than $6,000,000 of like bonds issued\r\nin aid of the Central Pacific Railroad, including those issued to the\r\nWestern Pacific Railroad Company, will have fallen due and been paid or\r\nmust on that day be paid by the Government. Without any reference to the\r\napplication of the sinking fund now in the Treasury, this will create\r\nsuch a default on the part of these companies to the Government as will\r\ngive it the right to at once institute proceedings to foreclose its\r\nmortgage lien. In addition to this indebtedness, which will be due\r\nJanuary 1, 1897, there will mature between that date and January 1,\r\n1899, the remaining principal of such subsidy bonds, which must also be\r\nmet by the Government. These amount to more than $20,000,000 on account\r\nof the Union Pacific lines and exceed $21,000,000 on account of the\r\nCentral Pacific lines.\r\n\r\nThe situation of these roads and the condition of their indebtedness to\r\nthe Government' have been fully set forth in the reports of various\r\ncommittees to the present and prior Congresses, and as early as 1887\r\nthey were thoroughly examined by a special commission appointed pursuant\r\nto an act of Congress. The considerations requiring an adjustment of the\r\nGovernment's relations to the companies have been clearly presented and\r\nthe conclusion reached with practical uniformity that if these relations\r\nare not terminated they should be revised upon a basis securing their\r\nsafe continuance.\r\n\r\nUnder section 4 of the act of Congress passed March 3, 1887, the\r\nPresident is charged with the duty, in the event that any mortgage or\r\nother incumbrance paramount to the interest of the United States in the\r\nproperty of the Pacific railroads should exist and be lawfully liable\r\nto be enforced, to direct the action of the Departments of Treasury and\r\nof Justice in the protection of the interest of the United States by\r\nredemption or through judicial proceedings, including foreclosures of\r\nthe Government liens.\r\n\r\nIn view of the fact that the Congress has for a number of years almost\r\nconstantly had under consideration various plans for dealing with the\r\nconditions existing between these roads and the Government, I have thus\r\nfar felt justified in withholding action under the statute above\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the Union Pacific Company, however, the situation\r\nhas become especially and immediately urgent. Proceedings have been\r\ninstituted to foreclose a first mortgage upon those aided parts of the\r\nmain lines upon which the Government holds a second and subordinate\r\nmortgage lien. In consequence of those proceedings and increasing\r\ncomplications, added to the default occurring on the 1st day of January,\r\n1897, a condition will be presented at that date, so far as this company\r\nis concerned, that must emphasize the mandate of the act of 1887 and\r\ngive to Executive duty under its provisions a more imperative aspect.\r\nTherefore, unless Congress shall otherwise direct or shall have\r\npreviously determined upon a different solution of the problem, there\r\nwill hardly appear to exist any reason for delaying beyond the date of\r\nthe default above mentioned such Executive action as will promise to\r\nsubserve the public interests and save the Government from the loss\r\nthreatened by further inaction.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Agriculture is so intimately related to the welfare of\r\nour people and the prosperity of our nation that it should constantly\r\nreceive the care and encouragement of the Government. From small\r\nbeginnings it has grown to be the center of agricultural intelligence\r\nand the source of aid and encouragement to agricultural efforts. Large\r\nsums of money are annually appropriated for the maintenance of this\r\nDepartment, and it must be confessed that the legislation relating to it\r\nhas not always been directly in the interest of practical farming or\r\nproperly guarded against waste and extravagance. So far, however, as\r\npublic money has been appropriated fairly and sensibly to help those who\r\nactually till the soil, no expenditure has been more profitably made or\r\nmore generally approved by the people.\r\n\r\nUnder the present management of the Department its usefulness has been\r\nenhanced in every direction, and at the same time strict economy has\r\nbeen enforced to the utmost extent permitted by Congressional action.\r\nFrom the report of the Secretary it appears that through careful and\r\nprudent financial management he has annually saved a large sum from his\r\nappropriations, aggregating during his incumbency and up to the close\r\nof the present fiscal year nearly one-fifth of the entire amount\r\nappropriated. These results have been accomplished by a conscientious\r\nstudy of the real needs of the farmer and such a regard for economy\r\nas the genuine farmer ought to appreciate, supplemented by a rigid\r\nadherence to civil-service methods in a Department which should be\r\nconducted in the interest of agriculture instead of partisan politics.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary reports that the value of our exports of farm products\r\nduring the last fiscal year amounted to $570,000,000, an increase of\r\n$17,000,000 over those of the year immediately preceding. This statement\r\nis not the less welcome because of the fact that, notwithstanding such\r\nincrease, the proportion of exported agricultural products to our total\r\nexports of all descriptions fell off during the year. The benefits of\r\nan increase in agricultural exports being assured, the decrease in its\r\nproportion to our total exports is the more gratifying when we consider\r\nthat it is owing to the fact that such total exports for the year\r\nincreased more than $75,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe large and increasing exportation of our agricultural products\r\nsuggests the great usefulness of the organization lately established in\r\nthe Department for the purpose of giving to those engaged in farming\r\npursuits reliable information concerning the condition, needs, and\r\nadvantages of different foreign markets. Inasmuch as the success of the\r\nfarmer depends upon the advantageous sale of his products, and inasmuch\r\nas foreign markets must largely be the destination of such products,\r\nit is quite apparent that a knowledge of the conditions and wants that\r\naffect those markets ought to result in sowing more intelligently and\r\nreaping with a better promise of profit. Such information points out the\r\nway to a prudent foresight in the selection and cultivation of crops and\r\nto a release from the bondage of unreasoning monotony of production, a\r\nglutted and depressed market, and constantly recurring unprofitable toil.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion the gratuitous distribution of seeds by the Department\r\nas at present conducted ought to be discontinued. No one can read the\r\nstatement of the Secretary on this subject and doubt the extravagance\r\nand questionable results of this practice. The professed friends of the\r\nfarmer, and certainly the farmers themselves, are naturally expected\r\nto be willing to rid a Department devoted to the promotion of farming\r\ninterests of a feature which tends so much to its discredit.\r\n\r\nThe Weather Bureau, now attached to the Department of Agriculture, has\r\ncontinued to extend its sphere of usefulness, and by an uninterrupted\r\nimprovement in the accuracy of its forecasts has greatly increased its\r\nefficiency as an aid and protection to all whose occupations are related\r\nto weather conditions.\r\n\r\nOmitting further reference to the operations of the Department, I\r\ncommend the Secretary's report and the suggestions it contains to the\r\ncareful consideration of the Congress.\r\n\r\nThe progress made in civil-service reform furnishes a cause for the\r\nutmost congratulation. It has survived the doubts of its friends as well\r\nas the rancor of its enemies and has gained a permanent place among the\r\nagencies destined to cleanse our politics and to improve, economize, and\r\nelevate the public service.\r\n\r\nThere are now in the competitive classified service upward of 84,000\r\nplaces, more than half of these having been included from time to time\r\nsince March 4, 1893. A most radical and sweeping extension was made by\r\nExecutive order dated the 6th day of May, 1896,[39] and if fourth-class\r\npostmasterships are not included in the statement it may be said that\r\npractically all positions contemplated by the civil-service law are now\r\nclassified. Abundant reasons exist for including these postmasterships,\r\nbased upon economy, improved service, and the peace and quiet of\r\nneighborhoods. If, however, obstacles prevent such action at present,\r\nI earnestly hope that Congress will, without increasing post-office\r\nappropriations, so adjust them as to permit in proper cases a\r\nconsolidation of these post-offices, to the end that through this\r\nprocess the result desired may to a limited extent be accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe civil-service rules as amended during the last year provide for a\r\nsensible and uniform method of promotion, basing eligibility to better\r\npositions upon demonstrated efficiency and faithfulness. The absence of\r\nfixed rules on this subject has been an infirmity in the system more and\r\nmore apparent as its other benefits have been better appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of civil-service methods in their business aspects are\r\ntoo well understood to require argument. Their application has become a\r\nnecessity to the executive work of the Government. But those who gain\r\npositions through the operation of these methods should be made to\r\nunderstand that the nonpartisan scheme through which they receive their\r\nappointments demands from them by way of reciprocity nonpartisan and\r\nfaithful performance of duty under every Administration and cheerful\r\nfidelity to every chief. While they should be encouraged to decently\r\nexercise their rights of citizenship and to support through their\r\nsuffrages the political beliefs they honestly profess, the noisy,\r\npestilent, and partisan employee, who loves political turmoil and\r\ncontention or who renders lax and grudging service to an Administration\r\nnot representing his political views, should be promptly and fearlessly\r\ndealt with in such a way as to furnish a warning to others who may be\r\nlikewise disposed.\r\n\r\nThe annual report of the Commissioners will be duly transmitted, and\r\nI commend the important matter they have in charge to the careful\r\nconsideration of the Congress.\r\n\r\nThe Interstate Commerce Commission has during the last year supplied\r\nabundant evidence of its usefulness and the importance of the work\r\ncommitted to its charge.\r\n\r\nPublic transportation is a universal necessity, and the question of just\r\nand reasonable charges therefor has become of vital importance not only\r\nto shippers and carriers, but also to the vast multitude of producers\r\nand consumers. The justice and equity of the principles embodied in the\r\nexisting law passed for the purpose of regulating these charges are\r\neverywhere conceded, and there appears to be no question that the policy\r\nthus entered upon has a permanent place in our legislation.\r\n\r\nAs the present statute when enacted was in the nature of the case more\r\nor less tentative and experimental, it was hardly expected to supply a\r\ncomplete and adequate system. While its wholesome effects are manifest\r\nand have amply justified its enactment, it is evident that all desired\r\nreforms in transportation methods have not been fully accomplished.\r\nIn view of the judicial interpretation which some provisions of this\r\nstatute have received and the defects disclosed by the efforts made for\r\nits enforcement, its revision and amendment appear to be essential, to\r\nthe end that it may more effectually reach the evils designed to be\r\ncorrected. I hope the recommendations of the Commission upon this\r\nsubject will be promptly and favorably considered by the Congress.\r\n\r\nI desire to recur to the statements elsewhere made concerning the\r\nGovernment's receipts and expenditures for the purpose of venturing upon\r\nsome suggestions touching our present tariff law and its operation.\r\n\r\nThis statute took effect on the 28th day of August, 1894. Whatever may\r\nbe its shortcomings as a complete measure of tariff reform, it must be\r\nconceded that it has opened the way to a freer and greater exchange of\r\ncommodities between us and other countries, and thus furnished a wider\r\nmarket for our products and manufactures.\r\n\r\nThe only entire fiscal year during which this law has been in force\r\nended on the 30th day of June, 1896. In that year our imports increased\r\nover those of the previous year more than $6,500,000, while the value\r\nof the domestic products we exported and which found markets abroad was\r\nnearly $70,000,000 more than during the preceding year.\r\n\r\nThose who insist that the cost to our people of articles coming to\r\nthem from abroad for their needful use should only be increased through\r\ntariff charges to an extent necessary to meet the expenses of the\r\nGovernment, as well as those who claim that tariff charges may be laid\r\nupon such articles beyond the necessities of Government revenue and with\r\nthe additional purpose of so increasing their price in our markets as\r\nto give American manufacturers and producers better and more profitable\r\nopportunities, must agree that our tariff laws are only primarily\r\njustified as sources of revenue to enable the Government to meet the\r\nnecessary expenses of its maintenance. Considered as to its efficiency\r\nin this aspect, the present law can by no means fall under just\r\ncondemnation. During the only complete fiscal year of its operation it\r\nhas yielded nearly $8,000,000 more revenue than was received from tariff\r\nduties in the preceding year. There was, nevertheless, a deficit between\r\nour receipts and expenditures of a little more than $25,000,000. This,\r\nhowever, was not unexpected.\r\n\r\nThe situation was such in December last, seven months before the close\r\nof the fiscal year, that the Secretary of the Treasury foretold a\r\ndeficiency of $17,000,000. The great and increasing apprehension and\r\ntimidity in business circles and the depression in all activities\r\nintervening since that time, resulting from causes perfectly well\r\nunderstood and entirely disconnected with our tariff law or its\r\noperation, seriously checked the imports we would have otherwise\r\nreceived and readily account for the difference between this estimate\r\nof the Secretary and the actual deficiency, as well as for a continued\r\ndeficit. Indeed, it must be confessed that we could hardly have had a\r\nmore unfavorable period than the last two years for the collection of\r\ntariff revenue. We can not reasonably hope that our recuperation from\r\nthis business depression will be sudden, but it has already set in with\r\na promise of acceleration and continuance.\r\n\r\nI believe our present tariff law, if allowed a fair opportunity, will\r\nin the near future yield a revenue which, with reasonably economical\r\nexpenditures, will overcome all deficiencies. In the meantime no deficit\r\nthat has occurred or may occur need excite or disturb us. To meet any\r\nsuch deficit we have in the Treasury in addition to a gold reserve of\r\none hundred millions a surplus of more than $128,000,000 applicable\r\nto the payment of the expenses of the Government, and which must,\r\nunless expended for that purpose, remain a useless hoard, or, if not\r\nextravagantly wasted, must in any event be perverted from the purpose of\r\nits exaction from our people. The payment, therefore, of any deficiency\r\nin the revenue from this fund is nothing more than its proper and\r\nlegitimate use. The Government thus applying a surplus fortunately in\r\nits Treasury to the payment of expenses not met by its current revenues\r\nis not at all to be likened to a man living beyond his income and thus\r\nincurring debt or encroaching on his principal.\r\n\r\nIt is not one of the functions of our Government to accumulate\r\nand make additions to a fund not needed for immediate expenditure.\r\nWith individuals it is the chief object of struggle and effort. The\r\napplication of an accumulated fund by the Government to the payment of\r\nits running expenses is a duty. An individual living beyond his income\r\nand embarrassing himself with debt or drawing upon his accumulated fund\r\nof principal is either unfortunate or improvident. The distinction is\r\nbetween a government charged with the duty of expending for the benefit\r\nof the people and for proper purposes all the money it receives from any\r\nsource, and the individual, who is expected to manifest a natural desire\r\nto avoid debt or to accumulate as much as possible and to live within\r\nthe income derived from such accumulations, to the end that they may be\r\nincreased or at least remain unimpaired for the future use and enjoyment\r\nof himself or the objects of his love and affection who may survive him.\r\n\r\nIt is immeasurably better to appropriate our surplus to the payment\r\nof justifiable expenses than to allow it to become an invitation to\r\nreckless appropriations and extravagant expenditures.\r\n\r\nI suppose it will not be denied that under the present law our people\r\nobtain the necessaries of a comfortable existence at a cheaper rate\r\nthan formerly. This is a matter of supreme importance, since it is the\r\npalpable duty of every just government to make the burdens of taxation\r\nas light as possible. The people should not be required to relinquish\r\nthis privilege of cheaper living except under the stress of their\r\nGovernment's necessity made plainly manifest.\r\n\r\nThis reference to the condition and prospects of our revenues naturally\r\nsuggests an allusion to the weakness and vices of our financial methods.\r\nThey have been frequently pressed upon the attention of Congress in\r\nprevious Executive communications and the inevitable danger of their\r\ncontinued toleration pointed out. Without now repeating these details,\r\nI can not refrain from again earnestly presenting the necessity of the\r\nprompt reform of a system opposed to every rule of sound finance and\r\nshown by experience to be fraught with the gravest peril and perplexity.\r\nThe terrible Civil War, which shook the foundations of our Government\r\nmore than thirty years ago, brought in its train the destruction of\r\nproperty, the wasting of our country's substance, and the estrangement\r\nof brethren. These are now past and forgotten. Even the distressing\r\nloss of life the conflict entailed is but a sacred memory which fosters\r\npatriotic sentiment and keeps alive a tender regard for those who\r\nnobly died. And yet there remains with us to-day in full strength and\r\nactivity, as an incident of that tremendous struggle, a feature of its\r\nfinancial necessities not only unsuited to our present circumstances,\r\nbut manifestly a disturbing menace to business security and an\r\never-present agent of monetary distress.\r\n\r\nBecause we may be enjoying a temporary relief from its depressing\r\ninfluence, this should not lull us into a false security nor lead us to\r\nforget the suddenness of past visitations.\r\n\r\nI am more convinced than ever that we can have no assured financial\r\npeace and safety until the Government currency obligations upon which\r\ngold may be demanded from the Treasury are withdrawn from circulation\r\nand canceled. This might be done, as has been heretofore recommended,\r\nby their exchange for long-term bonds bearing a low rate of interest or\r\nby their redemption with the proceeds of such bonds. Even if only the\r\nUnited States notes known as greenbacks were thus retired it is probable\r\nthat the Treasury notes issued in payment of silver purchases under the\r\nact of July 14, 1890, now paid in gold when demanded, would not create\r\nmuch disturbance, as they might from time to time, when received in the\r\nTreasury by redemption in gold or otherwise, be gradually and prudently\r\nreplaced by silver coin.\r\n\r\nThis plan of issuing bonds for the purpose of redemption certainly\r\nappears to be the most effective and direct path to the needed reform.\r\nIn default of this, however, it would be a step in the right direction\r\nif currency obligations redeemable in gold whenever so redeemed should\r\nbe canceled instead of being reissued. This operation would be a slow\r\nremedy, but it would improve present conditions.\r\n\r\nNational banks should redeem their own notes. They should be allowed to\r\nissue circulation to the par value of bonds deposited as security for\r\nits redemption and the tax on their circulation should be reduced to\r\none-fourth of 1 per cent.\r\n\r\nIn considering projects for the retirement of United States notes and\r\nTreasury notes issued under the law of 1890, I am of the opinion that we\r\nhave placed too much stress upon the danger of contracting the currency\r\nand have calculated too little upon the gold that would be added to our\r\ncirculation if invited to us by better and safer financial methods. It\r\nis not so much a contraction of our currency that should be avoided as\r\nits unequal distribution.\r\n\r\nThis might be obviated and any fear of harmful contraction at the same\r\ntime removed by allowing the organization of smaller banks and in less\r\npopulous communities than are now permitted, and also authorizing\r\nexisting banks to establish branches in small communities under proper\r\nrestrictions.\r\n\r\nThe entire case may be presented by the statement that the day of\r\nsensible and sound financial methods will not dawn upon us until our\r\nGovernment abandons the banking business and the accumulation of funds\r\nand confines its monetary operations to the receipt of the money\r\ncontributed by the people for its support and to the expenditure of such\r\nmoney for the people's benefit.\r\n\r\nOur business interests and all good citizens long for rest from feverish\r\nagitation and the inauguration by the Government of a reformed financial\r\npolicy which will encourage enterprise and make certain the rewards of\r\nlabor and industry.\r\n\r\nAnother topic in which our people rightfully take a deep interest\r\nmay be here briefly considered. I refer to the existence of trusts and\r\nother huge aggregations of capital the object of which is to secure the\r\nmonopoly of some particular branch of trade, industry, or commerce and\r\nto stifle wholesome competition. When these are defended, it is usually\r\non the ground that though they increase profits they also reduce prices,\r\nand thus may benefit the public. It must be remembered, however, that\r\na reduction of prices to the people is not one of the real objects\r\nof these organizations, nor is their tendency necessarily in that\r\ndirection. If it occurs in a particular case it is only because it\r\naccords with the purposes or interests of those managing the scheme.\r\n\r\nSuch occasional results fall far short of compensating the palpable\r\nevils charged to the account of trusts and monopolies. Their tendency\r\nis to crush out individual independence and to hinder or prevent the\r\nfree use of human faculties and the full development of human character.\r\nThrough them the farmer, the artisan, and the small trader is in danger\r\nof dislodgment from the proud position of being his own master, watchful\r\nof all that touches his country's prosperity, in which he has an\r\nindividual lot, and interested in all that affects the advantages of\r\nbusiness of which he is a factor, to be relegated to the level of a mere\r\nappurtenance to a great machine, with little free will, with no duty but\r\nthat of passive obedience, and with little hope or opportunity of rising\r\nin the scale of responsible and helpful citizenship.\r\n\r\nTo the instinctive belief that such is the inevitable trend of trusts\r\nand monopolies is due the widespread and deep-seated popular aversion in\r\nwhich they are held and the not unreasonable insistence that, whatever\r\nmay be their incidental economic advantages, their general effect upon\r\npersonal character, prospects, and usefulness can not be otherwise than\r\ninjurious.\r\n\r\nThough Congress has attempted to deal with this matter by legislation,\r\nthe laws passed for that purpose thus far have proved ineffective, not\r\nbecause of any lack of disposition or attempt to enforce them, but\r\nsimply because the laws themselves as interpreted by the courts do not\r\nreach the difficulty. If the insufficiencies of existing laws can be\r\nremedied by further legislation, it should be done. The fact must be\r\nrecognized, however, that all Federal legislation on this subject may\r\nfall short of its purpose because of inherent obstacles and also because\r\nof the complex character of our governmental system, which, while making\r\nthe Federal authority supreme within its sphere, has carefully limited\r\nthat sphere by metes and bounds that can not be transgressed. The\r\ndecision of our highest court on this precise question renders it quite\r\ndoubtful whether the evils of trusts and monopolies can be adequately\r\ntreated through Federal action unless they seek directly and purposely\r\nto include in their objects transportation or intercourse between States\r\nor between the United States and foreign countries.\r\n\r\nIt does not follow, however, that this is the limit of the remedy that\r\nmay be applied. Even though it may be found that Federal authority is\r\nnot broad enough to fully reach the case, there can be no doubt of the\r\npower of the several States to act effectively in the premises, and\r\nthere should be no reason to doubt their willingness to judiciously\r\nexercise such power.\r\n\r\nIn concluding this communication its last words shall be an appeal to\r\nthe Congress for the most rigid economy in the expenditure of the money\r\nit holds in trust for the people. The way to perplexing extravagance\r\nis easy, but a return to frugality is difficult. When, however, it is\r\nconsidered that those who bear the burdens of taxation have no guaranty\r\nof honest care save in the fidelity of their public servants, the duty\r\nof all possible retrenchment is plainly manifest.\r\n\r\nWhen our differences are forgotten and our contests of political\r\nopinion are no longer remembered, nothing in the retrospect of our\r\npublic service will be as fortunate and comforting as the recollection\r\nof official duty well performed and the memory of a constant devotion to\r\nthe interests of our confiding fellow-countrymen.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: See p. 624.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: See pp. 450-451.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: Of the second class 52,348,297 was county-free matter.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: See pp. 701-711.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, January 5, 1897_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, in response to a resolution of the Senate of the\r\n22d ultimo, a report from the Secretary of State, accompanied by copies\r\nof correspondence concerning the death of Charles Govin, a citizen of\r\nthe United States, in the island of Cuba.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, January 8, 1897_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, in response to the resolution of the House of\r\nRepresentatives of May 8, 1896, requesting information as to what had\r\nbeen done by the Department of State to carry out the provision in the\r\nact of March 2, 1895, making appropriations for the Department of\r\nAgriculture for the year 1896, as to negotiations with Great Britain to\r\nsecure the abrogation or modification of the regulations requiring the\r\nslaughter of cattle from the United States at the port of entry, a\r\nreport from the Secretary of State, with accompanying papers.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, January 8, 1897_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith the report of the Secretary of State in response to\r\nthe resolution of the House of Representatives of June 5, 1896, calling\r\nfor information concerning the changes made in the force of his\r\nDepartment since the 4th day of March, 1893.\r\n\r\nThis report has been in my hands since the 9th day of December, 1896,\r\nand its transmission to the House of Representatives has been delayed by\r\nmy inadvertence.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 11, 1897_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a treaty for the arbitration of all matters in\r\ndifference between the United States and Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThe provisions of the treaty are the result of long and patient\r\ndeliberation and represent concessions made by each party for the sake\r\nof agreement upon the general scheme.\r\n\r\nThough the result reached may not meet the views of the advocates of\r\nimmediate, unlimited, and irrevocable arbitration of all international\r\ncontroversies, it is nevertheless confidently believed that the treaty\r\ncan not fail to be everywhere recognized as making a long step in the\r\nright direction and as embodying a practical working plan by which\r\ndisputes between the two countries will reach a peaceful adjustment as\r\nmatter of course and in ordinary routine.\r\n\r\nIn the initiation of such an important movement it must be expected that\r\nsome of its features will assume a tentative character looking to a\r\nfurther advance, and yet it is apparent that the treaty which has been\r\nformulated not only makes war between the parties to it a remote\r\npossibility, but precludes those fears and rumors of war which of\r\nthemselves too often assume the proportions of national disaster.\r\n\r\nIt is eminently fitting as well as fortunate that the attempts to\r\naccomplish results so beneficent should be initiated by kindred peoples,\r\nspeaking the same tongue and joined together by all the ties of common\r\ntraditions, common institutions, and common aspirations. The experiment\r\nof substituting civilized methods for brute force as the means of\r\nsettling international questions of right will thus be tried under the\r\nhappiest auspices. Its success ought not to be doubtful, and the fact\r\nthat its ultimate ensuing benefits are not likely to be limited to the\r\ntwo countries immediately concerned should cause it to be promoted all\r\nthe more eagerly. The examples set and the lesson furnished by the\r\nsuccessful operation of this treaty are sure to be felt and taken to\r\nheart sooner or later by other nations, and will thus mark the beginning\r\nof a new epoch in civilization.\r\n\r\nProfoundly impressed as I am, therefore, by the promise of transcendent\r\ngood which this treaty affords, I do not hesitate to accompany its\r\ntransmission with an expression of my earnest hope that it may commend\r\nitself to the favorable consideration of the Senate.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 18, 1897_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith the report of Messrs. James B. Angell, of Michigan,\r\nJohn E. Russell, of Massachusetts, and Lyman E. Cooley, of Illinois, who\r\nwere appointed commissioners under the authority of a law passed March\r\n2, 1895, to make inquiry and report, after conference with such similar\r\ncommissioners as might be appointed on behalf of Great Britain or the\r\nDominion of Canada, concerning the feasibility of the construction of\r\nsuch canals as will enable vessels engaged in ocean commerce to pass\r\nbetween the Great Lakes and the Atlantic Ocean, and the most convenient\r\nlocation and probable cost of such canals, together with other facts and\r\ninformation in said act specified relating to their construction and\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners have prosecuted the work assigned them with great zeal\r\nand intelligence, resulting in the collection of a mass of information\r\nembodied in their report and its accompanying exhibits which is of great\r\nimportance and interest as related to the project subjected to their\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of direct and unbroken water transportation of the\r\nproducts of our Western States and Territories from convenient points of\r\nshipment to our seaboard ports are plainly palpable. The report of the\r\ncommissioners contains, in my opinion, demonstration of the feasibility\r\nof securing such transportation, and gives ground for the anticipation\r\nthat better and more uninterrupted commerce, through the plan suggested,\r\nbetween the great West and foreign ports, with the increase of national\r\nprosperity which must follow in its train, will not long escape American\r\nenterprise and activity.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the report of the commissioners, though as\r\ncomprehensive as the time and facilities at their disposal permitted,\r\ndoes not definitely deal with the cost of the work they were called upon\r\nto consider and omits some of the other details related to it. Thus far\r\nthey have labored without compensation, and a part of the small sum\r\nappropriated for the payment of their expenses still remains unexpended.\r\n\r\nI suggest to the Congress the propriety of making economical provision\r\nfor such further prosecution of their work as will more fully develop\r\nthe information necessary to an exact and complete understanding of this\r\ninteresting and important subject.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, January 22, 1897_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn response to the resolution of the Senate of December 15, 1896,\r\nrelating to Cuban affairs, I transmit a report from the Secretary of\r\nState, submitting a list of the claims filed in the Department of State\r\nby citizens of the United States against Spain arising out of the\r\ninsurrection existing in the island of Cuba, and the accompanying\r\ncorrespondence relating to the vessel called the _Competitor_ and\r\nthe persons claiming American citizenship captured thereon, which I deem\r\nit not incompatible with the public interests to communicate.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, January 25, 1897_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, in response to the Senate resolution of December\r\n21, 1896, addressed to the Secretary of State, a report of that officer\r\ncovering a list of persons claiming to be citizens of the United States\r\nwho have been arrested on the island of Cuba since February 24, 1895, to\r\nthe present time.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, February 1, 1897_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, in response to a resolution of the Senate of the\r\n6th ultimo, a report from the Secretary of State, accompanied by copies\r\nof correspondence concerning the arrest, imprisonment, trial, and\r\ncondemnation to perpetual imprisonment in chains of Jules Sanguily, a\r\ncitizen of the United States, by the authorities of Spain in Cuba.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 5, 1897_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe World's Columbian Commission has delivered to me certain documents\r\nand exhibits which they desire should constitute the final report\r\nrequired by section 12 of the act of Congress passed April 25, 1890,\r\nproviding for the celebration of the four hundredth anniversary of the\r\ndiscovery of America and the holding of an international exhibition in\r\nthe city of Chicago.\r\n\r\nThe documents referred to embrace the reports of the president and\r\nsecretary of the commission and a report of the executive committee on\r\nawards, with exhibits relating to the same.

Freeman.\"\r\n\r\nA former husband of the beneficiary, named Andrew V. Pritchard, did\r\nservice in the Mexican War, and on July 22, 1847, died of disease\r\ncontracted in such service. Thereupon the beneficiary named in this bill\r\nwas pensioned as his widow. She continued to receive this pension until\r\n1852, when she married John Freeman, through which she of course lost\r\nher pensionable status. Two minor children of the soldier were, however,\r\nplaced on the pension roll in her stead, and their pension was paid to\r\nthem until the youngest became 16 years of age, in 1863.\r\n\r\nJohn Freeman died in December, 1871, the beneficiary having been his\r\nwife for almost twenty years. It is now proposed to restore her to the\r\npension roll as the widow of her former husband, the Mexican soldier,\r\nwho died nearly fifty years ago, and notwithstanding the fact that less\r\nthan five years after his death she relinquished her right to a pension\r\nand surrendered her widowhood to become the wife of another husband,\r\nwith whom she lived for many years.\r\n\r\nI am not willing, even by inaction, to be charged with acquiescence in\r\nwhat appears to be such an entire departure from the principle, as well\r\nas sentiment, connected with reasonable pension legislation.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 22, 1897_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI return herewith without approval Senate bill No. 1323, entitled \"An\r\nact granting a pension to Maria Somerlat, widow of Valentine Somerlat.\"\r\n\r\nThis beneficiary, under the name of Maria Somerlat, was pensioned in\r\n1867 as the widow of Valentine Somerlat, a volunteer soldier, dating\r\nfrom his death, in 1864. She continued to draw the pension allowed\r\nher as such widow until 1881, when she married one Hiram Smith.\r\nSubsequently, but at what time does not appear, she was divorced from\r\nSmith in a suit that seems to have been begun by him, but in which\r\nshe interposed a cross bill and obtained judgment in her favor.\r\nNotwithstanding her remarriage, through which she ceased to be the widow\r\nof the dead soldier, it is proposed to pension her again on account of\r\nhis death.\r\n\r\nThe rule governing the operation of general pension laws which forfeits\r\na widow's pension on her remarriage seems so reasonable and just and\r\nits relaxation must necessarily lead to such a departure from just\r\nprinciples and to such vexatious pension administration that I am\r\nconvinced it ought to be strictly maintained.\r\n\r\nI hope I may be permitted to call the attention of the Senate to the\r\nincreasing latitude clearly discernible in special pension legislation.\r\nIt has seemed to me so useless to attempt to stem the tide of this\r\nlegislation by Executive interference that I have contented myself with\r\nnonacquiescence in numerous cases where I could not approve.\r\n\r\nThere have been already presented to me for Executive action during the\r\npresent session of the Congress 206 special pension bills, of which I\r\nhave actually examined 115. The entire number of such bills that have\r\nbecome laws during the four sessions of the Congress since March 4,\r\n1893, is 391. Some of those presented at the present session are not\r\nbased upon the least pretext that the death or disability involved is\r\nrelated to army service, while in numerous other cases it is extremely\r\ndifficult to satisfactorily discover such relationship.\r\n\r\nThere is one feature of this legislation which I am sure deserves\r\nattention. I refer to the great number of special bills passed for\r\nthe purpose of increasing the pensions of those already on the rolls.\r\nOf the 115 special pension bills which I have examined since the\r\nbeginning of the present session of the Congress, 58 granted or restored\r\npensions and 57 increased those already existing, and the appropriation\r\nof money necessary to meet these increases exceeds considerably the\r\namount required to pay the original pensions granted or restored by the\r\nremaining 58 bills.\r\n\r\nI can not discover that these increases are regulated by any rule\r\nor principle, and when we remember that there are nearly a million\r\npensioners on our rolls and consider the importunity for such increase\r\nthat must follow the precedents already made, the relation of the\r\nsubject to a justifiable increase of our national revenues can not\r\nescape attention.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 22, 1897_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return herewith without my approval House bill No. 6902, entitled\r\n\"An act granting a pension to Mrs. Mary A. Viel.\"\r\n\r\nThis beneficiary was married in 1862 to Major W.D. Sanger, then in the\r\nvolunteer military service. He died in 1872, never having made any\r\napplication for pension. His widow made no application for pension, but\r\nwithin three years after her husband's death, and in 1875, became the\r\nwife of Paul Viel. Eight years thereafter he died, leaving her his\r\nwidow, and it is now proposed to pension her as the widow of the\r\nsoldier, Major Sanger, though she long ago by her own deliberate act\r\nsurrendered that title and all its incidents.\r\n\r\nThere is a further objection to granting this pension. I do not find\r\nthat any claim is made that the death of the soldier, who was the\r\nbeneficiary's first husband, was at all attributable to his army\r\nservice. Neither he nor his widow, while she remained such, presented\r\nany such claim, nor is it found in reports of the committees in the\r\nSenate or House to whom the bill under consideration was referred.\r\nOn the contrary, the Senate Committee on Pensions in their report\r\ndistinctly state that \"there is no proof that soldier contracted disease\r\nwhile in the service or that he died of pensionable disabilities.\"\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _March i, 1897_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI return herewith without approval Senate bill No. 719, entitled \"An act\r\nto restore a pension to Harriet M. Knowlton.\"\r\n\r\nMajor William Knowlton, a most worthy volunteer soldier, died of wounds\r\nreceived in battle on the 20th day of September, 1864.\r\n\r\nIn 1865 his widow, the beneficiary named in this bill, was pensioned at\r\nthe rate of $25 a month, commencing on the day of her husband's death,\r\nwith an additional allowance for four minor children dating from July,\r\n1866.\r\n\r\nShe continued to receive this pension and allowance until November,\r\n1867, when she married Albin P. Stinchfield.\r\n\r\nThereupon her name was dropped from the pension roll, she having by\r\nher remarriage lost her pensionable condition, and her children were\r\npensioned at a small monthly rate from the date of their mother's\r\nremarriage until June 1, 1880, when the youngest became 16 years of age.\r\n\r\nThe beneficiary, after living with her second husband about twenty-two\r\nyears, secured a divorce from him in the year 1889, and it is now\r\nproposed to pension the divorced wife as the widow of her deceased\r\nsoldier husband at the rate she received while she was actually his\r\nwidow, thirty years ago.\r\n\r\nHer pensionable relation to the Government terminated with her\r\nremarriage, and her divorce from her second husband could not upon any\r\nground of principle restore it. A departure from this rule, even in aid\r\nof cases of hardship, can not fail to establish precedents inviting the\r\nabandonment of reasonable and justifiable pension theories.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _March 1, 1897_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return without approval House bill No. 1299, entitled \"An act\r\nto pension Harriet Woodbury, of Windsor, Vt.\"\r\n\r\nThe beneficiary named in this bill was the wife of Aaron G. Firman at\r\nthe time of his enlistment in 1863. He died October 2, 1864, and the\r\nbeneficiary, as his widow, was pensioned in 1865, from the day of her\r\nsoldier husband's death.\r\n\r\nShe continued to receive the pension allowed to her as such widow until\r\nJuly 14, 1866, when she married Samuel H. Woodbury. She was thereupon\r\ndropped from the pension roll pursuant to law, and in 1868 the minor son\r\nof the soldier was allowed a pension of $8 a month, commencing at the\r\ndate of the remarriage of his mother. This pension was increased to $10\r\na month in 1873, from July 25, 1866, and was continued until 1880, when\r\nthe minor child reached the age of 16 years.\r\n\r\nOn July 26, 1886, twenty years after the beneficiary ceased to be the\r\nwidow of the soldier Aaron G. Firman and became the wife of the civilian\r\nSamuel H. Woodbury, he died and she became his widow.\r\n\r\nIt is now proposed by this bill to pension her again as the widow of the\r\ndeceased soldier, notwithstanding her voluntary abandonment of that\r\nrelation to become the wife of another more than thirty years ago.\r\n\r\nNo feature of our pension laws is so satisfactory and just as a fair\r\nallowance to the widows of our soldiers who have died from causes\r\nattributable to their army service. When, however, such a beneficiary\r\nby remarriage surrenders her soldier widowhood and turns away from its\r\ntender and patriotic associations to assume again the relation and\r\nallegiance of wife to another husband, when she discards the soldier's\r\nname and in every way terminates her pensionable relationship to the\r\nGovernment, I am unable to discover any principle which justifies her\r\nrestoration to that relationship upon the death of her second husband.\r\n\r\nNo one can be insensible to the sad plight of a widow in needy\r\ncondition, but our pension laws should deal with soldiers' widows. I\r\nunderstand that only the existence of this relationship to a deceased\r\nsoldier creates through him the Government's duty and justifies the\r\napplication of public money to the relief of such widows.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _March 2, 1897_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return without approval House bill No. 7864, entitled \"An act\r\nto amend the immigration laws of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nBy the first section of this bill it is proposed to amend section 1 of\r\nthe act of March 3, 1891, relating to immigration by adding to the\r\nclasses of aliens thereby excluded from admission to the United States\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n  All persons physically capable and over 16 years of age who can not read\r\n  and write the English language or some other language; but a person not\r\n  so able to read and write who is over 50 years of age and is the parent\r\n  or grandparent of a qualified immigrant over 21 years of age and capable\r\n  of supporting such parent or grandparent may accompany such immigrant,\r\n  or such a parent or grandparent may be sent for and come to join the\r\n  family of a child or grandchild over 21 years of age similarly qualified\r\n  and capable, and a wife or minor child not so able to read and write may\r\n  accompany or be sent for and come and join the husband or parent\r\n  similarly qualified and capable.\r\n\r\n\r\nA radical departure from our national policy relating to immigration is\r\nhere presented. Heretofore we have welcomed all who came to us from\r\nother lands except those whose moral or physical condition or history\r\nthreatened danger to our national welfare and safety. Relying upon the\r\nzealous watchfulness of our people to prevent injury to our political\r\nand social fabric, we have encouraged those coming from foreign\r\ncountries to cast their lot with us and join in the development of our\r\nvast domain, securing in return a share in the blessings of American\r\ncitizenship.\r\n\r\nA century's stupendous growth, largely due to the assimilation and\r\nthrift of millions of sturdy and patriotic adopted citizens, attests the\r\nsuccess of this generous and free-handed policy which, while guarding\r\nthe people's interests, exacts from our immigrants only physical and\r\nmoral soundness and a willingness and ability to work.\r\n\r\nA contemplation of the grand results of this policy can not fail to\r\narouse a sentiment in its defense, for however it might have been\r\nregarded as an original proposition and viewed as an experiment its\r\naccomplishments are such that if it is to be uprooted at this late day\r\nits disadvantages should be plainly apparent and the substitute adopted\r\nshould be just and adequate, free from uncertainties, and guarded\r\nagainst difficult or oppressive administration.\r\n\r\nIt is not claimed, I believe, that the time has come for the further\r\nrestriction of immigration on the ground that an excess of population\r\novercrowds our land.\r\n\r\nIt is said, however, that the quality of recent immigration is\r\nundesirable. The time is quite within recent memory when the same thing\r\nwas said of immigrants who, with their descendants, are now numbered\r\namong our best citizens.\r\n\r\nIt is said that too many immigrants settle in our cities, thus\r\ndangerously increasing their idle and vicious population. This is\r\ncertainly a disadvantage. It can not be shown, however, that it affects\r\nall our cities, nor that it is permanent; nor does it appear that this\r\ncondition where it exists demands as its remedy the reversal of our\r\npresent immigration policy.\r\n\r\nThe claim is also made that the influx of foreign laborers deprives of\r\nthe opportunity to work those who are better entitled than they to the\r\nprivilege of earning their livelihood by daily toil. An unfortunate\r\ncondition is certainly presented when any who are willing to labor are\r\nunemployed, but so far as this condition now exists among our people it\r\nmust be conceded to be a result of phenomenal business depression and\r\nthe stagnation of all enterprises in which labor is a factor. With the\r\nadvent of settled and wholesome financial and economic governmental\r\npolicies and consequent encouragement to the activity of capital the\r\nmisfortunes of unemployed labor should, to a great extent at least, be\r\nremedied. If it continues, its natural consequences must be to check the\r\nfurther immigration to our cities of foreign laborers and to deplete the\r\nranks of those already there. In the meantime those most willing and\r\nbest entitled ought to be able to secure the advantages of such work as\r\nthere is to do.\r\n\r\nIt is proposed by the bill under consideration to meet the alleged\r\ndifficulties of the situation by establishing an educational test by\r\nwhich the right of a foreigner to make his home with us shall be\r\ndetermined. Its general scheme is to prohibit from admission to our\r\ncountry all immigrants \"physically capable and over 16 years of age who\r\ncan not read and write the English language or some other language,\" and\r\nit is provided that this test shall be applied by requiring immigrants\r\nseeking admission to read and afterwards to write not less than twenty\r\nnor more than twenty-five words of the Constitution of the United States\r\nin some language, and that any immigrant failing in this shall not be\r\nadmitted, but shall be returned to the country from whence he came at\r\nthe expense of the steamship or railroad company which brought him.\r\n\r\nThe best reason that could be given for this radical restriction of\r\nimmigration is the necessity of protecting our population against\r\ndegeneration and saving our national peace and quiet from imported\r\nturbulence and disorder.\r\n\r\nI can not believe that we would be protected against these evils by\r\nlimiting immigration to those who can read and write in any language\r\ntwenty-five words of our Constitution. In my opinion, it is infinitely\r\nmore safe to admit a hundred thousand immigrants who, though unable to\r\nread and write, seek among us only a home and opportunity to work than\r\nto admit one of those unruly agitators and enemies of governmental\r\ncontrol who can not only read and write, but delights in arousing by\r\ninflammatory speech the illiterate and peacefully inclined to discontent\r\nand tumult. Violence and disorder do not originate with illiterate\r\nlaborers. They are, rather, the victims of the educated agitator. The\r\nability to read and write, as required in this bill, in and of itself\r\naffords, in my opinion, a misleading test of contented industry and\r\nsupplies unsatisfactory evidence of desirable citizenship or a proper\r\napprehension of the benefits of our institutions. If any particular\r\nelement of our illiterate immigration is to be feared for other causes\r\nthan illiteracy, these causes should be dealt with directly, instead of\r\nmaking illiteracy the pretext for exclusion, to the detriment of other\r\nilliterate immigrants against whom the real cause of complaint can not\r\nbe alleged.\r\n\r\nThe provisions intended to rid that part of the proposed legislation\r\nalready referred to from obvious hardship appears to me to be indefinite\r\nand inadequate.\r\n\r\nA parent, grandparent, wife, or minor child of a qualified immigrant,\r\nthough unable to read and write, may accompany the immigrant or be sent\r\nfor to join his family, provided the immigrant is capable of supporting\r\nsuch relative. These exceptions to the general rule of exclusion\r\ncontained in the bill were made to prevent the separation of families,\r\nand yet neither brothers nor sisters are provided for. In order that\r\nrelatives who are provided for may be reunited, those still in foreign\r\nlands must be sent for to join the immigrant here. What formality is\r\nnecessary to constitute this prerequisite, and how are the facts of\r\nrelationship and that the relative is sent for to be established?\r\nAre the illiterate relatives of immigrants who have come here under\r\nprior laws entitled to the advantage of these exceptions? A husband who\r\ncan read and write and who determines to abandon his illiterate wife\r\nabroad will find here under this law an absolutely safe retreat. The\r\nilliterate relatives mentioned must not only be sent for, but such\r\nimmigrant must be capable of supporting them when they arrive. This\r\nrequirement proceeds upon the assumption that the foreign relatives\r\ncoming here are in every case, by reason of poverty, liable to become\r\na public charge unless the immigrant is capable of their support. The\r\ncontrary is very often true. And yet if unable to read and write, though\r\nquite able and willing to support themselves and their relatives here\r\nbesides, they could not be admitted under the provisions of this bill\r\nif the immigrant was impoverished, though the aid of his fortunate but\r\nilliterate relative might be the means of saving him from pauperism.\r\n\r\nThe fourth section of this bill provides--\r\n\r\n  That it shall be unlawful for any male alien who has not in good faith\r\n  made his declaration before the proper court of his intention to become\r\n  a citizen of the United States to be employed on any public works of the\r\n  United States or to come regularly or habitually into the United States\r\n  by land or water for the purpose of engaging in any mechanical trade or\r\n  manual labor for wages or salary, returning from time to time to a\r\n  foreign country.\r\n\r\nThe fifth section provides--\r\n\r\n  That it shall be unlawful for any person, partnership, company, or\r\n  corporation knowingly to employ any alien coming into the United States\r\n  in violation of the next preceding section of this act.\r\n\r\nThe prohibition against the employment of aliens upon any public works\r\nof the United States is in line with other legislation of a like\r\ncharacter. It is quite a different thing, however, to declare it a crime\r\nfor an alien to come regularly and habitually into the United States for\r\nthe purpose of obtaining work from private parties, if such alien\r\nreturns from time to time to a foreign country, and to constitute any\r\nemployment of such alien a criminal offense.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider these provisions of the bill in connection with our\r\nlong northern frontier and the boundaries of our States and Territories,\r\noften but an imaginary line separating them from the British dominions,\r\nand recall the friendly intercourse between the people who are neighbors\r\non either side, the provisions of this bill affecting them must be\r\nregarded as illiberal, narrow, and un-American.\r\n\r\nThe residents of these States and Territories have separate and especial\r\ninterests which in many cases make an interchange of labor between their\r\npeople and their alien neighbors most important, frequently with the\r\nadvantage largely in favor of our citizens. This suggests the\r\ninexpediency of Federal interference with these conditions when not\r\nnecessary to the correction of a substantial evil, affecting the general\r\nwelfare. Such unfriendly legislation as is proposed could hardly fail to\r\nprovoke retaliatory measures, to the injury of many of our citizens who\r\nnow find employment on adjoining foreign soil.\r\n\r\nThe uncertainty of construction to which the language of these\r\nprovisions is subject is a serious objection to a statute which\r\ndescribes a crime. An important element in the offense sought to be\r\ncreated by these sections is the coming \"regularly or habitually into\r\nthe United States.\" These words are impossible of definite and certain\r\nconstruction. The same may be said of the equally important words\r\n\"returning from time to time to a foreign country.\"\r\n\r\nA careful examination of this bill has convinced me that for the reasons\r\ngiven and others not specifically stated its provisions are\r\nunnecessarily harsh and oppressive, and that its defects in construction\r\nwould cause vexation and its operation would result in harm to our\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOCKET VETOES.\r\n\r\n\r\n[\"An act granting a pension to Mrs. Mary Gould Carr, widow of the late\r\nBrigadier and Brevet Major General Joseph B.

The rules concerning lights shall be complied with in all\r\n  weathers from sunset to sunrise, and during such time no other lights\r\n  which may be mistaken for the prescribed lights shall be exhibited.\r\n\r\n  ART. 2. A steam vessel when under way shall carry--\r\n\r\n  (_a_) On or in front of the foremast, or if a vessel without a\r\n  foremast, then in the fore part of the vessel, at a height above the\r\n  hull of not less than 20 feet, and if the breadth of the vessel exceeds\r\n  20 feet, then at a height above the hull not less than such breadth, so,\r\n  however, that the light need not be carried at a greater height above\r\n  the hull than 40 feet, a bright white light so constructed as to show an\r\n  unbroken light over an arc of the horizon of 20 points of the compass,\r\n  so fixed as to throw the light 10 points on each side of the\r\n  vessel--namely, from right ahead to 2 points abaft the beam on either\r\n  side--and of such a character as to be visible at a distance of at least\r\n  5 miles.\r\n\r\n  (_b_) On the starboard side a green light so constructed as to show\r\n  an unbroken light over an arc of the horizon of 10 points of the\r\n  compass, so fixed as to throw the light from right ahead to 2 points\r\n  abaft the beam on the starboard side, and of such a character as to be\r\n  visible at a distance of at least 2 miles.\r\n\r\n  (_c_) On the port side a red light so constructed as to show an\r\n  unbroken light over an arc of the horizon of 10 points of the compass,\r\n  so fixed as to throw the light from right ahead to 2 points abaft the\r\n  beam on the port side, and of such a character as to be visible at a\r\n  distance of at least 2 miles.\r\n\r\n  (_d_) The said green and red side lights shall be fitted with\r\n  inboard screens projecting at least 3 feet forward from the light, so as\r\n  to prevent these lights from being seen across the bow.\r\n\r\n  (_e_) A steam vessel when under way may carry an additional white\r\n  light similar in construction to the light mentioned in subdivision\r\n  (_a_). These two lights shall be so placed in line with the keel\r\n  that one shall be at least 15 feet higher than the other, and in such a\r\n  position with reference to each other that the lower light shall be\r\n  forward of the upper one. The vertical distance between these lights\r\n  shall be less than the horizontal distance.\r\n\r\n  ART. 3. A steam vessel when towing another vessel shall, in addition to\r\n  her side lights, carry two bright white lights in a vertical line one\r\n  over the other, not less than 6 feet apart, and when towing more than\r\n  one vessel shall carry an additional bright white light 6 feet above or\r\n  below such light, if the length of the tow measuring from the stern of\r\n  the towing vessel to the stern of the last vessel towed exceeds 600\r\n  feet. Each of these lights shall be of the same construction and\r\n  character and shall be carried in the same position as the white light\r\n  mentioned in article 2 (_a_), excepting the additional light, which\r\n  may be carried at a height of not less than 14 feet above the hull.\r\n\r\n  Such steam vessel may carry a small white light abaft the funnel or\r\n  aftermast for the vessel towed to steer by, but such light shall not be\r\n  visible forward of the beam.\r\n\r\n  ART. 4. (_a_) A vessel which from any accident is not under command\r\n  shall carry at the same height as a white light mentioned in article 2\r\n  (_a_), where they can best be seen, and if a steam vessel in lieu\r\n  of that light, two red lights in a vertical line one over the other, not\r\n  less than 6 feet apart, and of such a character as to be visible all\r\n  around the horizon at a distance of at least 2 miles, and shall by day\r\n  carry in a vertical line one over the other, not less than 6 feet apart,\r\n  where they can best be seen, two black balls or shapes each 2 feet in\r\n  diameter.\r\n\r\n  (_b_) A vessel employed in laying or in picking up a telegraph\r\n  cable shall carry in the same position as the white light mentioned in\r\n  articles (_a_), and if a steam vessel in lieu of that light, three\r\n  lights in a vertical line one over the other, not less than 6 feet\r\n  apart. The highest and lowest of these lights shall be red and the\r\n  middle light shall be white, and they shall be of such a character as to\r\n  be visible all around the horizon at a distance of at least 2 miles. By\r\n  day she shall carry in a vertical line one over the other, not less than\r\n  6 feet apart, where they can best be seen, three shapes not less than 2\r\n  feet in diameter, of which the highest and lowest shall be globular in\r\n  shape and red in color and the middle one diamond in shape and white.\r\n\r\n  (_c_) The vessels referred to in this article when not making way\r\n  through the water shall not carry the side lights, but when making way\r\n  shall carry them.\r\n\r\n  (_d_) The lights and shapes required to be shown by this article\r\n  are to be taken by other vessels as signals that the vessel showing them\r\n  is not under command and can not, therefore, get out of the way.\r\n\r\n  These signals are not signals of vessels in distress and requiring\r\n  assistance. Such signals are contained in article 31.\r\n\r\n  ART. 5. A sailing vessel under way and any vessel being towed shall\r\n  carry the same lights as are prescribed by article 2 for a steam vessel\r\n  under way, with the exception of the white lights mentioned therein,\r\n  which they shall never carry.\r\n\r\n  ART. 6. Whenever, as in the case of small vessels under way during bad\r\n  weather, the green and red side lights can not be fixed, these lights\r\n  shall be kept at hand, lighted and ready for use, and shall on the\r\n  approach of or to other vessels be exhibited on their respective sides,\r\n  in sufficient time to prevent collision, in such manner as to make them\r\n  most visible and so that the green light shall not be seen on the port\r\n  side nor the red light on the starboard side, nor, if practicable, more\r\n  than 2 points abaft the beam on their respective sides.\r\n\r\n  To make the use of these portable lights more certain and easy the\r\n  lanterns containing them shall each be painted outside with the color of\r\n  the light they respectively contain and shall be provided with proper\r\n  screens.\r\n\r\n  ART. 7. Steam vessels of less than 40 and vessels under oars or sails of\r\n  less than 20 tons gross tonnage, respectively, when under way shall not\r\n  be obliged to carry the lights mentioned in article 2 (_a_),\r\n  (_b_), and (_c_), but if they do not carry them they shall be\r\n  provided with the following lights:\r\n\r\n  First. Steam vessels of less than 40 tons shall carry--\r\n\r\n  (_a_) In the fore part of the vessel or on or in front of the\r\n  funnel, where it can best be seen, and at a height above the gunwale of\r\n  not less than 9 feet, a bright white light constructed and fixed as\r\n  prescribed in article 2 (_a_) and of such a character as to be\r\n  visible at a distance of at least 2 miles.\r\n\r\n  (_b_) Green and red side lights constructed and fixed as prescribed\r\n  in article 2 (_b_) and (_c_) and of such a character as to be\r\n  visible at a distance of at least 1 mile, or a combined lantern showing\r\n  a green light and a red light from right ahead to 2 points abaft the\r\n  beam on their respective sides. Such lanterns shall be carried not less\r\n  than 3 feet below the white light.\r\n\r\n  Second. Small steamboats, such as are carried by seagoing vessels, may\r\n  carry the white light at a less height than 9 feet above the gunwale,\r\n  but it shall be carried above the combined lantern mentioned in\r\n  subdivision 1 (_b_).\r\n\r\n  Third. Vessels under oars or sails of leas than 20 tons shall have ready\r\n  at hand a lantern with a green glass on one side and a red glass on the\r\n  other, which on the approach of or to other vessels shall be exhibited,\r\n  in sufficient time to prevent collision, so that the green light shall\r\n  not be seen on the port side nor the red light on the starboard side.\r\n\r\n  The vessels referred to in this article shall not be obliged to carry\r\n  the lights prescribed by article 4 (_a_) and article 11 last\r\n  paragraph.\r\n\r\n  ART. 8. Pilot vessels when engaged on their station on pilotage duty\r\n  shall not show the lights required for other vessels, but shall carry a\r\n  white light at the masthead, visible all around the horizon, and shall\r\n  also exhibit a flare-up light or flare-up lights at short intervals,\r\n  which shall never exceed fifteen minutes.\r\n\r\n  On the near approach of or to other vessels they shall have their side\r\n  lights lighted ready for use and shall flash or show them at short\r\n  intervals to indicate the direction in which they are heading; but the\r\n  green light shall not be shown on the port side nor the red light on the\r\n  starboard side.\r\n\r\n  A pilot vessel of such a class as to be obliged to go alongside of a\r\n  vessel to put a pilot on board may show the white light instead of\r\n  carrying it at the masthead, and may instead of the colored lights above\r\n  mentioned have at hand ready for use a lantern with a green glass on the\r\n  one side and a red glass on the other, to be used as prescribed above.\r\n\r\n  Pilot vessels when not engaged on their station on pilotage duty shall\r\n  carry lights similar to those of other vessels of their tonnage.\r\n\r\n  ART. 9. Fishing vessels and fishing boats when under way and when not\r\n  required by this article to carry or show the lights therein named shall\r\n  carry or show the lights prescribed for vessels of their tonnage under\r\n  way.\r\n\r\n  (_a_) Vessels and boats when fishing with drift nets shall exhibit\r\n  two white lights from any part of the vessel where they can best be\r\n  seen. Such lights shall be placed so that the vertical distance between\r\n  them shall be not less than 6 feet and not more than 10 feet, and so\r\n  that the horizontal distance between them measured in a line with the\r\n  keel shall be not less than 5 feet and not more than 10 feet. The lower\r\n  of these two lights shall be the more forward, and both of them shall be\r\n  of such a character as to show all around the horizon and to be visible\r\n  at a distance of not less than 3 miles.\r\n\r\n  (_b_) Vessels when engaged in trawling, by which is meant the\r\n  dragging of an apparatus along the bottom of the sea--\r\n\r\n  First. If steam vessels, shall carry in the same position as the white\r\n  light mentioned in article 2 (_a_) tricolored lantern so\r\n  constructed and fixed as to show a white light from right ahead to 2\r\n  points on each bow and a green light and a red light over an arc of the\r\n  horizon from 2 points on either bow to 2 points abaft the beam on the\r\n  starboard and port sides, respectively, and not less than 6 nor more\r\n  than 12 feet below the tricolored lantern a white light in a lantern so\r\n  constructed as to show a clear, uniform, and unbroken light all around\r\n  the horizon.\r\n\r\n  Second. If sailing vessels of 7 tons gross tonnage and upward, shall\r\n  carry a white light in a lantern so constructed as to show a clear,\r\n  uniform, and unbroken light all around the horizon, and shall also be\r\n  provided with a sufficient supply of red pyrotechnic lights, which shall\r\n  each burn for at least thirty seconds and shall be shown on the approach\r\n  of or to other vessels in sufficient time to prevent collision.\r\n\r\n  In the Mediterranean Sea the vessels referred to in subdivision\r\n  (_b_) 2 may use a flare-up light in lieu of a pyrotechnic light.\r\n\r\n  All lights mentioned in subdivision (_b_) 1 and 2 shall be visible\r\n  at a distance of at least 2 miles.\r\n\r\n  Third. If sailing vessels of less than 7 tons gross tonnage, shall not\r\n  be obliged to carry the white light mentioned in subdivision (_b_)\r\n  2 of this article, but if they do not carry such light they shall have\r\n  at hand, ready for use, a lantern showing a bright white light, which\r\n  shall on the approach of or to other vessels be exhibited where it can\r\n  best be seen in sufficient time to prevent collision; and they shall\r\n  also show a red pyrotechnic light, as prescribed in subdivision\r\n  (_b_) 2, or in lieu thereof a flare-up light.\r\n\r\n  (_c_) Vessels and boats when line fishing with their lines out and\r\n  attached to their lines, and when not at anchor or stationary, shall\r\n  carry the same lights as vessels fishing with drift nets.\r\n\r\n  (_d_) Fishing vessels and fishing boats may at any time use a\r\n  flare-up light in addition to the lights which they are by this article\r\n  required to carry and show. All flare-up lights exhibited by a vessel\r\n  when trawling or fishing with any kind of drag net shall be shown at the\r\n  after part of the vessel, excepting that if the vessel is hanging by the\r\n  stern to her fishing gear they shall be exhibited from the bow.\r\n\r\n  (_e_) Every fishing vessel and every boat when at anchor shall\r\n  exhibit a white light visible all around the horizon at a distance of at\r\n  least 1 mile.\r\n\r\n  (_f_) If a vessel or boat when fishing becomes stationary in\r\n  consequence of her gear getting fast to a rock or other obstruction, she\r\n  shall show the light and make the fog signal prescribed for a vessel at\r\n  anchor, respectively. (See article 15 (_d_), (_e_), and last\r\n  paragraph.)\r\n\r\n  (_g_) In fog, mist, falling snow, or heavy rain storms drift-net\r\n  vessels attached to their nets, and vessels when trawling, dredging, or\r\n  fishing with any kind of dragnet, and vessels line fishing with their\r\n  lines out shall, if of 20 tons gross tonnage or upward, respectively, at\r\n  intervals of not more than one minute make a blast--if steam vessels,\r\n  with the whistle or siren, and if sailing vessels, with the fog\r\n  horn--each blast to be followed by ringing the bell.\r\n\r\n  (_h_) Sailing vessels or boats fishing with nets or lines or trawls\r\n  when under way shall in daytime indicate their occupation to an\r\n  approaching vessel by displaying a basket or other efficient signal\r\n  where it can best be seen.\r\n\r\n  The vessels referred to in this article shall not be obliged to carry\r\n  the light prescribed by article 4 (_a_) and article 11, last\r\n  paragraph.\r\n\r\n  ART. 10. A vessel which is being overtaken by another shall show from\r\n  her stern to such last-mentioned vessel a white light or a flare-up\r\n  light.\r\n\r\n  The white light required to be shown by this article may be fixed and\r\n  carried in a lantern, but in such case the lantern shall be so\r\n  constructed, fitted, and screened that it shall throw an unbroken light\r\n  over an arc of the horizon of 12 points of the compass--namely, for 6\r\n  points from right aft on each side of the vessel--so as to be visible at\r\n  a distance of at least 1 mile. Such light shall be carried as nearly as\r\n  practicable on the same level as the side lights.\r\n\r\n  ART. 11. A vessel under 150 feet in length when at anchor shall carry\r\n  forward, where it can best be seen, but at a height not exceeding 20\r\n  feet above the hull, a white light in a lantern so constructed as to\r\n  show a clear, uniform, and unbroken light visible all around the horizon\r\n  at a distance of at least 1 mile.\r\n\r\n  A vessel of 150 feet or upward in length when at anchor shall carry in\r\n  the forward part of the vessel, at a height of not less than 20 and not\r\n  exceeding 40 feet above the hull, one such light, and at or near the\r\n  stern of the vessel, and at such a height that it shall be not less than\r\n  15 feet lower than the forward light, another such light.\r\n\r\n  The length of a vessel shall be deemed to be the length appearing in her\r\n  certificate of registry.\r\n\r\n  A vessel aground in or near a fairway shall carry the above light or\r\n  lights and the two red lights prescribed by article 4 (_a_).\r\n\r\n  ART. 12. Every vessel may, if necessary in order to attract attention,\r\n  in addition to the lights which she is by these rules required to carry,\r\n  show a flare-up light or use any detonating signal that can not be\r\n  mistaken for a distress signal.\r\n\r\n  ART. 13. Nothing in these rules shall interfere with the operation of\r\n  any special rules made by the government of any nation with respect to\r\n  additional station and signal lights for two or more ships of war or\r\n  for vessels sailing under convoy, or with the exhibition of recognition\r\n  signals adopted by ship owners, which have been authorized by their\r\n  respective governments and duly registered and published.\r\n\r\n  ART. 14. A steam vessel proceeding under sail only, but having her\r\n  funnel up, shall carry in daytime forward, where it can best be seen,\r\n  one black ball or shape 2 feet in diameter.\r\n\r\n\r\n  SOUND SIGNALS FOR FOG, ETC.\r\n\r\n  ART. 15. All signals prescribed by this article for vessels under way\r\n  shall be given--\r\n\r\n  1. By \"steam vessels,\" on the whistle or siren.\r\n\r\n  2. By \"sailing vessels\" and \"vessels towed,\" on the fog horn.\r\n\r\n  The words \"prolonged blast\" used in this article shall mean a blast of\r\n  from four to six seconds' duration.\r\n\r\n  A steam vessel shall be provided with an efficient whistle or siren,\r\n  sounded by steam or by some substitute for steam, so placed that the\r\n  sound may not be intercepted by any obstruction, and with an efficient\r\n  fog horn, to be sounded by mechanical means, and also with an efficient\r\n  bell. (In all cases where the rules require a bell to be used a drum may\r\n  be substituted on board Turkish vessels or a gong where such articles\r\n  are used on board small seagoing vessels.) A sailing vessel of 20 tons\r\n  gross tonnage or upward shall be provided with a similar fog horn and\r\n  bell.\r\n\r\n  In fog, mist, falling snow, or heavy rain storms, whether by day or\r\n  night, the signals described in this article shall be used as follows,\r\n  viz:\r\n\r\n  (_a_) A steam vessel having way upon her shall sound at intervals\r\n  of not more than two minutes a prolonged blast.\r\n\r\n  (_b_) A steam vessel under way, but stopped and having no way upon\r\n  her, shall sound at intervals of not more than two minutes two prolonged\r\n  blasts, with an interval of about one second between them.\r\n\r\n  (_c_) A sailing vessel under way shall sound at intervals of not\r\n  more than one minute, when on the starboard tack one blast, when on the\r\n  port tack two blasts in succession, and when with the wind abaft the\r\n  beam three blasts in succession.\r\n\r\n  (_d_) A vessel when at anchor shall at intervals of not more than\r\n  one minute ring the bell rapidly for about five seconds.\r\n\r\n  (_e_) A vessel at anchor at sea, when not in ordinary anchorage\r\n  ground and when in such a position as to be an obstruction to vessels\r\n  under way, shall sound, if a steam vessel, at intervals of not more than\r\n  two minutes, two prolonged blasts with her whistle or siren, followed by\r\n  ringing her bell, or if a sailing vessel, at intervals of not more than\r\n  one minute, two blasts with her fog horn, followed by ringing her bell.\r\n\r\n  (_f_) A vessel when towing shall, instead of the signals prescribed\r\n  in subdivisions (_a_) and (_c_) of this article, at intervals\r\n  of not more than two minutes sound three blasts in succession, namely,\r\n  one prolonged blast followed by two short blasts. A vessel towed may\r\n  give this signal, and she shall not give any other.\r\n\r\n  (_g_) A steam vessel wishing to indicate to another \"The way is off\r\n  my vessel; you may feel your way past me\" may sound three blasts in\r\n  succession--namely, short, long, short--with intervals of about one\r\n  second between them.\r\n\r\n  (_h_) A vessel employed in laying or picking up a telegraph cable\r\n  shall on hearing the fog signal of an approaching vessel sound in answer\r\n  three prolonged blasts in succession.\r\n\r\n  (_i_) A vessel under way which is unable to get out of the way of\r\n  an approaching vessel through being not under command or unable to\r\n  maneuver as required by these rules shall on hearing the fog signal of\r\n  an approaching vessel sound in answer four short blasts in succession.\r\n\r\n  Sailing vessels and boats of less than 20 tons gross tonnage shall not\r\n  be obliged to give the above-mentioned signals, but if they do not they\r\n  shall make some other efficient sound signal at intervals of not more\r\n  than one minute.\r\n\r\n\r\n  SPEED OF SHIPS TO BE MODERATE IN FOG, ETC.\r\n\r\n  ART. 16. Every vessel shall in a fog, mist, falling snow, or heavy rain\r\n  storms go at a moderate speed, having careful regard to the existing\r\n  circumstances and conditions.\r\n\r\n  A steam vessel hearing, apparently forward of her beam, the fog signal\r\n  of a vessel the position of which is not ascertained shall, so far as\r\n  the circumstances of the case admit, stop her engines and then navigate\r\n  with caution until danger of collision is over.\r\n\r\n\r\n  STEERING AND SAILING RULES.\r\n\r\n  PRELIMINARY.--RISK OF COLLISION.\r\n\r\n  Risk of collision can, when circumstances permit, be ascertained by\r\n  carefully watching the compass bearing of an approaching vessel. If the\r\n  bearing does not appreciably change, such risk should be deemed to\r\n  exist.\r\n\r\n  ART. 17. When two sailing vessels are approaching one another so as to\r\n  involve risk of collision, one of them shall keep out of the way of the\r\n  other as follows, namely:\r\n\r\n  (_a_) A vessel which is running free shall keep out of the way of a\r\n  vessel which is closehauled.\r\n\r\n  (_b_) A vessel which is closehauled on the port tack shall keep out\r\n  of the way of a vessel which is closehauled on the starboard tack.\r\n\r\n  (_c_) When both are running free with the wind on different sides,\r\n  the vessel which has the wind on the port side shall keep out of the way\r\n  of the other.\r\n\r\n  (_d_) When both are running free with the wind on the same side,\r\n  the vessel which is to the windward shall keep out of the way of the\r\n  vessel which is to leeward.\r\n\r\n  (_e_) A vessel which has the wind aft shall keep out of the way of\r\n  the other vessel.\r\n\r\n  ART. 18. When two steam vessels are meeting end on or nearly end on, so\r\n  as to involve risk of collision, each shall alter her course to\r\n  starboard, so that each may pass on the port side of the other.\r\n\r\n  This article only applies to cases where vessels are meeting end on or\r\n  nearly end on in such a manner as to involve risk of collision, and does\r\n  not apply to two vessels which must, if both keep on their respective\r\n  courses, pass clear of each other.\r\n\r\n  The only cases to which it does apply are when each of the two vessels\r\n  is end on or nearly end on to the other; in other words, to cases in\r\n  which by day each vessel sees the masts of the other in a line or nearly\r\n  in a line with her own, and by night to cases in which each vessel is in\r\n  such a position as to see both the side lights of the other.\r\n\r\n  It does not apply by day to cases in which a vessel sees another ahead\r\n  crossing her own course, or by night to cases where the red light of one\r\n  vessel is opposed to the red light of the other, or where the green\r\n  light of one vessel is opposed to the green light of the other, or where\r\n  a red light without a green light or a green light without a red light\r\n  is seen ahead, or where both green and red lights are seen anywhere but\r\n  ahead.\r\n\r\n  ART. 19. When two steam vessels are crossing, so as to involve risk of\r\n  collision, the vessel which has the other on her own starboard side\r\n  shall keep out of the way of the other.\r\n\r\n  ART. 20. When a steam vessel and a sailing vessel are proceeding in such\r\n  directions as to involve risk of collision, the steam vessel shall keep\r\n  out of the way of the sailing vessel.\r\n\r\n  ART. 21. Where by any of these rules one of two vessels is to keep out\r\n  of the way, the other shall keep her course and speed.\r\n\r\n  ART. 22. Every vessel which is directed by these rules to keep out\r\n  of the way of another vessel shall, if the circumstances of the case\r\n  admit, avoid crossing ahead of the other.\r\n\r\n  ART. 23. Every steam vessel which is directed by these rules to keep out\r\n  of the way of another vessel shall on approaching her, if necessary,\r\n  slacken her speed or stop or reverse.\r\n\r\n  ART. 24. Notwithstanding anything contained in these rules every vessel\r\n  overtaking any other shall keep out of the way of the overtaken vessel.\r\n\r\n  Every vessel coming up with another vessel from any direction more than\r\n  2 points abaft her beam--that is, in such a position with reference to\r\n  the vessel which she is overtaking that at night she would be unable to\r\n  see either of that vessel's side lights--shall be deemed to be an\r\n  overtaking vessel, and no subsequent alteration of the bearing between\r\n  the two vessels shall make the overtaking vessel a crossing vessel\r\n  within the meaning of these rules or relieve her of the duty of keeping\r\n  clear of the overtaken vessel until she is finally past and clear.\r\n\r\n  As by day the overtaking vessel can not always know with certainty\r\n  whether she is forward of or abaft this direction from the other vessel,\r\n  she should if in doubt assume that she is an overtaking vessel and keep\r\n  out of the way.\r\n\r\n  ART. 25. In narrow channels every steam vessel shall, when it is safe\r\n  and practicable, keep to that side of the fairway or mid-channel which\r\n  lies on the starboard side of such vessel.\r\n\r\n  ART. 26. Sailing vessels under way shall keep out of the way of sailing\r\n  vessels or boats fishing with nets or lines or trawls. This rule shall\r\n  not give to any vessel or boat engaged in fishing the right of\r\n  obstructing a fairway used by vessels other than fishing vessels or\r\n  boats.\r\n\r\n  ART. 27. In obeying and construing these rules due regard shall be had\r\n  to all dangers of navigation and collision and to any special\r\n  circumstances which may render a departure from the above rules\r\n  necessary in order to avoid immediate danger.\r\n\r\n\r\n  SOUND SIGNALS FOR VESSELS IN SIGHT OF ONE ANOTHER.\r\n\r\n  ART. 28.

Nothing in these rules shall exonerate any vessel or the owner\r\n  or master or crew thereof from the consequences of any neglect to carry\r\n  lights or signals, or of any neglect to keep a proper lookout, or of the\r\n  neglect of any precaution which may be required by the ordinary practice\r\n  of seamen or by the special circumstances of the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n  RESERVATION OF RULES FOR HARBORS AND INLAND NAVIGATION.\r\n\r\n  ART. 30.
