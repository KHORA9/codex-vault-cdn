III\r\n\r\n\r\nNew York\r\nHadley & Mathews\r\n156 Fifth Avenue\r\nLondon: Duckworth & Co.\r\n1899\r\n\r\nPrinted by BALLANTYNE, HANSON & CO.\r\nAt the Ballantyne Press\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     _To the_ Right Honourable\r\n     #William Lord Cowper#\r\n     Baron of Wingham[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n     MY LORD,\r\n\r\n     After having long celebrated the superior graces and excellences\r\n     among men, in an imaginary character, I do myself the honour to\r\n     show my veneration for transcendent merit, under my own name, in\r\n     this address to your lordship. The just application of those high\r\n     accomplishments of which you are master, has been an advantage to\r\n     all your fellow subjects; and it is from the common obligation you\r\n     have laid upon all the world, that I, though a private man, can\r\n     pretend to be affected with, or take the liberty to acknowledge\r\n     your great talents and public virtues.\r\n\r\n     It gives a pleasing prospect to your friends, that is to say, to\r\n     the friends of your country, that you have passed through the\r\n     highest offices, at an age when others usually do but form to\r\n     themselves the hopes of them.[2] They may expect to see you in the\r\n     House of Lords as many years as you were ascending to it. It is our\r\n     common good, that your admirable eloquence can now no longer be\r\n     employed but in the expression of your own sentiments and judgment.\r\n     The skilful pleader is now for ever changed into the just judge;\r\n     which latter character your lordship exerts with so prevailing an\r\n     impartiality, that you win the approbation even of those who\r\n     dissent from you, and you always obtain favour, because you are\r\n     never moved by it.\r\n\r\n     This gives you a certain dignity peculiar to your present\r\n     situation, and makes the equity, even of a Lord High Chancellor,\r\n     appear but a degree towards the magnanimity of a peer of Great\r\n     Britain.\r\n\r\n     Forgive me, my lord, when I cannot conceal from you, that I shall\r\n     never hereafter behold you, but I shall behold you, as lately,\r\n     defending the brave, and the unfortunate.[3]\r\n\r\n     When we attend to your lordship, engaged in a discourse, we cannot\r\n     but reflect upon the many requisites which the vainglorious\r\n     speakers of antiquity have demanded in a man who is to excel in\r\n     oratory; I say, my lord, when we reflect upon the precepts by\r\n     viewing the example, though there is no excellence proposed by\r\n     those rhetoricians wanting, the whole art seems to be resolved into\r\n     that one motive of speaking, sincerity in the intention. The\r\n     graceful manner, the apt gesture, and the assumed concern, are\r\n     impotent helps to persuasion, in comparison of the honest\r\n     countenance of him who utters what he really means. From hence it\r\n     is, that all the beauties which others attain with labour, are in\r\n     your lordship but the natural effects of the heart that dictates.\r\n\r\n     It is this noble simplicity which makes you surpass mankind in the\r\n     faculties wherein mankind are distinguished from other creatures,\r\n     reason and speech.\r\n\r\n     If these gifts were communicated to all men in proportion to the\r\n     truth and ardour of their hearts, I should speak of you with the\r\n     same force as you express yourself on any other subject. But I\r\n     resist my present impulse, as agreeable as it is to me; though\r\n     indeed, had I any pretensions to a fame of this kind, I should,\r\n     above all other themes, attempt a panegyric upon my Lord Cowper:\r\n     for the only sure way to a reputation for eloquence, in an age\r\n     wherein that perfect orator lives, is to choose an argument, upon\r\n     which he himself must of necessity be silent. I am,\r\n\r\n                              My Lord, your Lordship's\r\n                                Most devoted, most obedient, and\r\n                                               Most humble Servant,\r\n                                                      RICHARD STEELE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: William Cowper was appointed King's counsel about 1694; he\r\nsucceeded Sir Nathan Wright, as Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, October\r\n11, 1705; was created Baron Cowper of Wingham, November 9, 1706; and was\r\nappointed Lord Chancellor, May 4, 1707, which post he held till\r\nSeptember 14, 1710. On the accession of King George, he was again\r\nappointed Lord Chancellor, and, on resigning the Great Seal, was created\r\nEarl Cowper and Viscount Fordwich, March 18, 1717-18. He died in 1723.\r\nLord Cowper refused to accept New Year's gifts from the counsellors at\r\nlaw, which had been long given to his predecessors, and, when he was\r\nChancellor, though in friendship with the Duke of Marlborough, and of\r\nthe same political principles, he refused to put the broad seal of his\r\noffice to a commission for making his Grace generalissimo for life.\r\n\"When Steele's patent, as Governor of the Theatre Royal, passed the\r\nGreat Seal, Lord Chancellor Cowper, in compliment to Sir Richard, would\r\nreceive no fee\" (Cibber's \"Apology\"). He was praised by Hughes, under\r\nthe name of \"Manilius,\" in No. 467 of the _Spectator_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The date of Lord Cowper's birth is not known, but in 1710\r\nhe was probably about 46. He entered the Middle Temple in 1682.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: In a pamphlet entitled \"A Letter to Isaac Bickerstaff,\"\r\n1710, Lord Cowper defended the character of the Duchess of Marlborough\r\nagainst an attack by Bolingbroke in a \"Letter to the _Examiner_.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#THE TATLER#\r\nBY ISAAC BICKERSTAFF, ESQ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 115.                                                     [STEELE.\r\n\r\nFrom _Saturday, Dec. 31, 1709_, to _Tuesday, Jan. 3, 1709-10_.\r\n\r\n    --Novum intervenit vitium et calamitas,\r\n    Ut neque spectari, neque cognosci potuerit:\r\n    Ita populus studio stupidus in funambulo\r\n    Animum occupârat.--TER., Hecyra, Prologue.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sheer Lane, January 2._\r\n\r\nI went on Friday last to the opera, and was surprised to find a thin\r\nhouse at so noble an entertainment, till I heard that the tumbler[4] was\r\nnot to make his appearance that night. For my own part, I was fully\r\nsatisfied with the sight of an actor, who, by the grace and propriety of\r\nhis action and gesture, does honour to a human figure, as much as the\r\nother vilifies and degrades it. Every one will easily imagine I mean\r\nSignor Nicolini,[5] who sets off the character he bears in an opera by\r\nhis action, as much as he does the words of it by his voice. Every limb,\r\nand every finger, contributes to the part he acts, insomuch that a deaf\r\nman might go along with him in the sense of it. There is scarce a\r\nbeautiful posture in an old statue which he does not plant himself in,\r\nas the different circumstances of the story give occasion for it. He\r\nperforms the most ordinary action in a manner suitable to the greatness\r\nof his character, and shows the prince even in the giving of a letter,\r\nor the despatching of a message. Our best actors are somewhat at a loss\r\nto support themselves with proper gesture, as they move from any\r\nconsiderable distance to the front of the stage; but I have seen the\r\nperson of whom I am now speaking, enter alone at the remotest part of\r\nit, and advance from it with such greatness of air and mien, as seemed\r\nto fill the stage, and at the same time commanding the attention of the\r\naudience with the majesty of his appearance. But notwithstanding the\r\ndignity and elegance of this entertainment, I find for some nights past,\r\nthat Punchinello has robbed the gentleman of the greater part of his\r\nfemale spectators. The truth of it is, I find it so very hard a task to\r\nkeep that sex under any manner of government, that I have often resolved\r\nto give them over entirely, and leave them to their own inventions. I\r\nwas in hopes that I had brought them to some order, and was employing my\r\nthoughts on the reformation of their petticoats, when on a sudden I\r\nreceived information from all parts, that they run gadding after a\r\npuppet-show. I know very well, that what I here say will be thought by\r\nsome malicious persons to flow from envy to Mr. Powell; for which\r\nreason, I shall set the late dispute between us in a true light.[6] Mr.\r\nPowell and I had some difference about four months ago, which we managed\r\nby way of letter, as learned men ought to do; and I was very well\r\ncontented to bear such sarcasms as he was pleased to throw upon me, and\r\nanswered them with the same freedom. In the midst of this our\r\nmisunderstanding and correspondence, I happened to give the world an\r\naccount of the order of esquires[7]; upon which, Mr. Powell was so\r\ndisingenuous, as to make one of his puppets (I wish I knew which of them\r\nit was) declare by way of prologue, that one Isaac Bickerstaff, a\r\npretended esquire, had wrote a scurrilous piece to the dishonour of that\r\nrank of men; and then, with more art than honesty, concluded, that all\r\nthe esquires in the pit were abused by his antagonist as much he was.\r\nThis public accusation made all the esquires of that county, and several\r\nof other parts, my professed enemies. I do not in the least question but\r\nthat he will proceed in his hostilities; and I am informed, that part of\r\nhis design in coming up to town was to carry the war into my own\r\nquarters. I do therefore solemnly declare (notwithstanding that I am a\r\ngreat lover of art and ingenuity) that if I hear he opens any of his\r\npeople's mouths against me, I shall not fail to write a critique upon\r\nhis whole performance; for I must confess, that I have naturally so\r\nstrong a desire of praise, that I cannot bear reproach, though from a\r\npiece of timber. As for Punch, who takes all opportunities of\r\nbespattering me, I know very well his original, and have been assured by\r\nthe joiner who put him together, that he was in long dispute with\r\nhimself, whether he should turn him into several pegs and utensils, or\r\nmake him the man he is. The same person confessed to me, that he had\r\nonce actually laid aside his head for a nutcracker. As for his scolding\r\nwife (however she may value herself at present), it is very well known\r\nthat she is but a piece of crabtree. This artificer further whispered in\r\nmy ear, that all his courtiers and nobles were taken out of a quickset\r\nhedge not far from Islington; and that Dr. Faustus himself, who is now\r\nso great a conjurer, is supposed to have learned his whole art from an\r\nold woman in that neighbourhood, whom he long served in the figure of a\r\nbroomstaff.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps it may look trivial to insist so much upon men's persons; I\r\nshall therefore turn my thoughts rather to examine their behaviour, and\r\nconsider, whether the several parts are written up to that character\r\nwhich Mr. Powell piques himself upon, of an able and judicious\r\ndramatist. I have for this purpose provided myself with the works of\r\nabove twenty French critics, and shall examine (by the rules which they\r\nhave laid down upon the art of the stage) whether the unity of time,\r\nplace and action, be rightly observed in any one of this celebrated\r\nauthor's productions; as also, whether in the parts of his several\r\nactors, and that of Punch in particular, there is not sometimes an\r\nimpropriety of sentiments, and an impurity of diction.\r\n\r\n\r\n_White's Chocolate-house, January 2._\r\n\r\nI came in here to-day at an hour when only the dead appear in places of\r\nresort and gallantry, and saw hung up the escutcheon of Sir Hannibal,[8]\r\na gentleman who used to frequent this place, and was taken up and\r\ninterred by the Company of Upholders, as having been seen here at an\r\nunlicensed hour. The coat of the deceased is, three bowls and a jack in\r\na green field; the crest, a dice-box, with the king of clubs and Pam for\r\nsupporters. Some days ago the body was carried out of town with great\r\npomp and ceremony, in order to be buried with his ancestors at the Peak.\r\nIt is a maxim in morality, that we are to speak nothing but truth of the\r\nliving, nothing but good of the dead. As I have carefully observed the\r\nfirst during his lifetime, I shall acquit myself as to the latter now he\r\nis deceased.\r\n\r\nHe was knighted very young, not in the ordinary form, but by the common\r\nconsent of mankind.\r\n\r\nHe was in his person between round and square; in the motion and gesture\r\nof his body he was unaffected and free, as not having too great a\r\nrespect for superiors. He was in his discourse bold and intrepid; and as\r\nevery one has an excellence as well as a failing which distinguishes him\r\nfrom other men, eloquence was his predominant quality, which he had to\r\nso great a perfection, that it was easier to him to speak than to hold\r\nhis tongue. This sometimes exposed him to the derision of men who had\r\nmuch less parts than himself: and indeed his great volubility and\r\ninimitable manner of speaking, as well as the great courage he showed on\r\nthose occasions, did sometimes betray him into that figure of speech\r\nwhich is commonly distinguished by the name of \"gasconade.\" To mention\r\nno other, he professed in this very place some few days before he died,\r\nthat he would be one of the six that would undertake to assault me; for\r\nwhich reason I have had his figure upon my wall till the hour of his\r\ndeath: and am resolved for the future to bury every one forthwith who I\r\nhear has an intention to kill me.\r\n\r\nSince I am upon the subject of my adversaries, I shall here publish a\r\nshort letter which I have received from a well-wisher, and is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     \"SAGE SIR,\r\n\r\n     \"You cannot but know, there are many scribblers and others who\r\n     revile you and your writings. It is wondered that you do not exert\r\n     yourself, and crush them at once. I am,\r\n\r\n                                        \"Sir (with great respect),\r\n                                            \"Your most humble Admirer\r\n                                                \"and Disciple.\"\r\n\r\nIn answer to this, I shall act like my predecessor Æsop, and give him a\r\nfable instead of a reply.\r\n\r\nIt happened one day, as a stout and honest mastiff (that guarded the\r\nvillage where he lived against thieves and robbers) was very gravely\r\nwalking, with one of his puppies by his side, all the little dogs in the\r\nstreet gathered about him, and barked at him. The little puppy was so\r\noffended at this affront done to his sire, that he asked him why he\r\nwould not fall upon them, and tear them to pieces?\r\n\r\nTo which the sire answered, with a great composure of mind, \"If there\r\nwere no curs, I should be no mastiff.\"[9]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: See No. 108.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Cavalier Nicolini Grimaldi was a Neapolitan actor and\r\nsinger, who appeared first in England in McSwiney's \"Pyrrhus and\r\nDemetrius.\" He is often mentioned in the _Spectator_ (see Nos. 5, 13,\r\n405), and seems to have been a friend of both Addison and Steele.\r\nAddison praises him alike as an actor and as a singer. The following\r\nletter from Hughes to Nicolini, dated February 4, 1709-10, is given in\r\nHughes' \"Correspondence\" (Dublin, 1773, i. 33-4): \"Depuis que j'ai eu\r\nl'honneur d'être chez vous à la répétition de l'opéra, j'ai diné avec\r\nMr. Steele, et la conversation roulante sur vous, je lui dis la manière\r\nobligeante dont je vous avois ou parler de Mr. Bickerstaff, en disant\r\nque vous aviez beaucoup d'inclination à étudier l'Anglois pour avoir\r\nseulement le plaisir de lire le _Tatler_. Il trouvre que votre\r\ncompliment à l'auteur du _Tatler_ est fort galant.\" Nicolini sang in\r\nItalian to the English of Mrs. Tofts (see No. 20, and _Spectator_, No.\r\n22), but Cibber observes that \"whatever defect the fashionably skilful\r\nmight find in her manner, she had, in the general sense of her\r\nspectators, charms that few of the most learned singers ever arrive at.\"\r\nA letter from Lady Wentworth, dated December 10, 1708, gives us a\r\ncurious glimpse of Nicolini and Mrs. Tofts: \"My dearest and best of\r\nchildren ... Yesterday I had lyke to have been ketched in a trap, your\r\nBrother Wentworth had almoste persuaded me to have gon last night to\r\nhear the fyne muisick the famous Etallion sing att the rehersall of the\r\nOperer, which he asured me it was soe dark none could see me. Indeed\r\nmusick was the greatest temtation I could have, but I was afraid he\r\ndeceaved me, soe Betty only went with his wife and him; and I rejoysed I\r\ndid not, for thear was a vast deal of company and good light--but the\r\nDutchis of Molbery had gott the Etallion to sing and he sent an excuse,\r\nbut the Dutchis of Shrosberry made him com, brought him in her coach,\r\nbut Mrs. Taufs huft and would not sing becaus he had first put it ofe;\r\nthough she was thear yet she would not, but went away. I wish the house\r\nwould al joyne to humble her and not receav her again. This man out dus\r\nSefachoe, they say that has hard both\" (\"Wentworth Papers,\" 1883, p.\r\n66). Mr. Cartwright quotes from a letter in Lord Egmont's collection,\r\ndated March 17, 1709: \"This day the opera of 'Camilla' is acted\r\nexpressly for Lord Marlborough. Our famous Nicolini got 800 guineas for\r\nhis day; and 'tis thought Mrs. Tofts, whose turn it is on Tuesday next,\r\nwill get a vast deal. She was on Sunday last at the Duke of Somerset's,\r\nwhere there was about thirty gentlemen, and every kiss was one guinea;\r\nsome took three, others four, others five, at that rate, but none less\r\nthan one.\" (Seventh Report of Hist. MSS. Commission, p. 246).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: See Nos. 11, 44, 45.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: See No. 19.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Sir James Baker, known as the \"Knight of the Peak\"; see No.\r\n118. Steele's comments on gambling in the _Tatler_ brought upon him the\r\nanger of many of the sharpers. There is a well-known story that Lord\r\nForbes, Major-General Davenport, and Brigadier Bisset were in the St.\r\nJames's Coffee-house when some well-dressed men entered, and began to\r\nabuse Steele as the author of the _Tatler_. One of them swore that he\r\nwould cut Steele's throat or teach him better manners. \"In this\r\ncountry,\" said Lord Forbes, \"you will find it easier to cut a purse than\r\nto cut a throat\"; and the cut-throats were soon turned out of the house\r\nwith every mark of disgrace. A similar incident is described in a\r\nrecently published letter from Lady Marow to her daughter, Lady Kaye\r\n(\"Manuscripts of the Earl of Dartmouth,\" iii. 148; Hist. MSS. Comm.,\r\nFifteenth Report, Part I.). Writing on January 5, 1709-10, Lady Marow\r\nsays: \"All the town are full of the _Tatler_, which I hope you have to\r\nprepare you for discourse, for no visit is made that I hear of but Mr.\r\nBickerstaff is mentioned, and I am told he has done so much good that\r\nthe sharpers cannot increase their stocks as they did formerly; for one\r\nYoung came into the chocolate-house, and said he would stop Mr.\r\nBickerstaff if he knew him. Mr. Steele, who is thought to write the\r\n_Tatler_, heard Young say so, and, when he went out of the house, said\r\nhe should walk in St. James's Park an hour, if any would speak with him;\r\nbut the Hector took no notice.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: In the original folio number, after indication of certain\r\nerrata in No. 114, comes the following note: \"The reader is desired not\r\nto pronounce anything in any one of these writings _nonsense_, till the\r\nfollowing paper comes out.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 116.

Amor. 344.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sheer Lane, January 4._\r\n\r\nThe court being prepared for proceeding on the cause of the petticoat, I\r\ngave orders to bring in a criminal who was taken up as she went out of\r\nthe puppet-show about three nights ago, and was now standing in the\r\nstreet with a great concourse of people about her. Word was brought me,\r\nthat she had endeavoured twice or thrice to come in, but could not do it\r\nby reason of her petticoat, which was too large for the entrance of my\r\nhouse, though I had ordered both the folding-doors to be thrown open for\r\nits reception. Upon this, I desired the jury of matrons, who stood at my\r\nright hand, to inform themselves of her condition, and know whether\r\nthere were any private reasons why she might not make her appearance\r\nseparate from her petticoat. This was managed with great discretion, and\r\nhad such an effect, that upon the return of the verdict from the bench\r\nof matrons, I issued out an order forthwith, that the criminal should be\r\nstripped of her encumbrances, till she became little enough to enter my\r\nhouse. I had before given directions for an engine of several legs, that\r\ncould contract or open itself like the top of an umbrello,[10] in order\r\nto place the petticoat upon it, by which means I might take a leisurely\r\nsurvey of it, as it should appear in its proper dimensions. This was all\r\ndone accordingly; and forthwith, upon the closing of the engine, the\r\npetticoat was brought into court. I then directed the machine to be set\r\nupon the table, and dilated in such a manner as to show the garment in\r\nits utmost circumference; but my great hall was too narrow for the\r\nexperiment; for before it was half unfolded, it described so immoderate\r\na circle, that the lower part of it brushed upon my face as I sate in my\r\nchair of judicature. I then inquired for the person that belonged to the\r\npetticoat; and to my great surprise, was directed to a very beautiful\r\nyoung damsel, with so pretty a face and shape, that I bid her come out\r\nof the crowd, and seated her upon a little crock at my left hand. \"My\r\npretty maid,\" said I, \"do you own yourself to have been the inhabitant\r\nof the garment before us?\" The girl I found had good sense, and told me\r\nwith a smile, that notwithstanding it was her own petticoat, she should\r\nbe very glad to see an example made of it; and that she wore it for no\r\nother reason, but that she had a mind to look as big and burly as other\r\npersons of her quality; that she had kept out of it as long as she\r\ncould, and till she began to appear little in the eyes of all her\r\nacquaintance; that if she laid it aside, people would think she was not\r\nmade like other women. I always give great allowances to the fair sex\r\nupon account of the fashion, and therefore was not displeased with the\r\ndefence of my pretty criminal. I then ordered the vest which stood\r\nbefore us to be drawn up by a pulley to the top of my great hall, and\r\nafterwards to be spread open by the engine it was placed upon, in such a\r\nmanner, that it formed a very splendid and ample canopy over our heads,\r\nand covered the whole court of judicature with a kind of silken rotunda,\r\nin its form not unlike the cupola of St. Paul's. I entered upon the\r\nwhole cause with great satisfaction as I sat under the shadow of it.\r\n\r\nThe counsel for the petticoat was now called in, and ordered to produce\r\nwhat they had to say against the popular cry which was raised against\r\nit. They answered the objections with great strength and solidity of\r\nargument, and expatiated in very florid harangues, which they did not\r\nfail to set off and furbelow (if I may be allowed the metaphor) with\r\nmany periodical sentences and turns of oratory. The chief arguments for\r\ntheir client were taken, first, from the great benefit that might arise\r\nto our woollen manufactury from this invention, which was calculated as\r\nfollows: the common petticoat has not above four yards in the\r\ncircumference; whereas this over our heads had more in the\r\nsemi-diameter; so that by allowing it twenty-four yards in the\r\ncircumference, the five millions of woollen petticoats, which (according\r\nto Sir William Petty) supposing what ought to be supposed in a\r\nwell-governed state, that all petticoats are made of that stuff, would\r\namount to thirty millions of those of the ancient mode. A prodigious\r\nimprovement of the woollen trade! and what could not fail to sink the\r\npower of France in a few years.\r\n\r\nTo introduce the second argument, they begged leave to read a petition\r\nof the ropemakers, wherein it was represented, that the demand for\r\ncords, and the price of them, were much risen since this fashion came\r\nup. At this, all the company who were present lifted up their eyes into\r\nthe vault; and I must confess, we did discover many traces of cordage\r\nwhich were interwoven in the stiffening of the drapery.\r\n\r\nA third argument was founded upon a petition of the Greenland trade,\r\nwhich likewise represented the great consumption of whalebone which\r\nwould be occasioned by the present fashion, and the benefit which would\r\nthereby accrue to that branch of the British trade.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, they gently touched upon the weight and unwieldiness of the\r\ngarment, which they insinuated might be of great use to preserve the\r\nhonour of families.\r\n\r\nThese arguments would have wrought very much upon me (as I then told the\r\ncompany in a long and elaborate discourse) had I not considered the\r\ngreat and additional expense which such fashions would bring upon\r\nfathers and husbands; and therefore by no means to be thought of till\r\nsome years after a peace. I further urged, that it would be a prejudice\r\nto the ladies themselves, who could never expect to have any money in\r\nthe pocket, if they laid out so much on the petticoat. To this I added,\r\nthe great temptation it might give to virgins, of acting in security\r\nlike married women, and by that means give a check to matrimony, an\r\ninstitution always encouraged by wise societies.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, in answer to the several petitions produced on that\r\nside, I showed one subscribed by the women of several persons of\r\nquality, humbly setting forth, that since the introduction of this mode,\r\ntheir respective ladies had, instead of bestowing on them their cast\r\ngowns, cut them into shreds, and mixed them with the cordage and\r\nbuckram, to complete the stiffening of their under-petticoats. For\r\nwhich, and sundry other reasons, I pronounced the petticoat a\r\nforfeiture: but to show that I did not make that judgment for the sake\r\nof filthy lucre, I ordered it to be folded up, and sent it as a present\r\nto a widow gentlewoman, who has five daughters, desiring she would make\r\neach of them a petticoat out of it, and send me back the remainder,\r\nwhich I design to cut into stomachers, caps, facings of my waistcoat\r\nsleeves, and other garnitures suitable to my age and quality.\r\n\r\nI would not be understood, that, while I discard this monstrous\r\ninvention, I am an enemy to the proper ornaments of the fair sex. On\r\nthe contrary, as the hand of nature has poured on them such a profusion\r\nof charms and graces, and sent them into the world more amiable and\r\nfinished than the rest of her works; so I would have them bestow upon\r\nthemselves all the additional beauties that art can supply them with,\r\nprovided it does not interfere with, disguise, or pervert, those of\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nI consider woman as a beautiful romantic animal, that may be adorned\r\nwith furs and feathers, pearls and diamonds, ores and silks. The lynx\r\nshall cast its skin at her feet to make her a tippet; the peacock,\r\nparrot, and swan, shall pay contributions to her muff; the sea shall be\r\nsearched for shells, and the rocks for gems; and every part of nature\r\nfurnish out its share towards the embellishment of a creature that is\r\nthe most consummate work of it. All this I shall indulge them in; but as\r\nfor the petticoat I have been speaking of, I neither can, nor will allow\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Swift uses this form of the word: \"It served him for a\r\nnightcap when he went to bed, and for an umbrello in rainy whether.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 117.

My own circumstances are indeed so narrow and scanty, that I\r\nshould taste but very little pleasure, could I receive it only from\r\nthose enjoyments which are in my own possession; but by this great\r\ntincture of humanity, which I find in all my thoughts and reflections,\r\nI am happier than any single person can be, with all the wealth,\r\nstrength, beauty, and success, that can be conferred upon a mortal, if\r\nhe only relishes such a proportion of these blessings as is vested in\r\nhimself, and is his own private property. By this means, every man that\r\ndoes himself any real service, does me a kindness. I come in for my\r\nshare in all the good that happens to a man of merit and virtue, and\r\npartake of many gifts of fortune and power that I was never born to.\r\nThere is nothing in particular in which I so much rejoice, as the\r\ndeliverance of good and generous spirits out of dangers, difficulties,\r\nand distresses. And because the world does not supply instances of this\r\nkind to furnish out sufficient entertainments for such a humanity and\r\nbenevolence of temper, I have ever delighted in reading the history of\r\nages past, which draws together into a narrow compass the great\r\noccurrences and events that are but thinly sown in those tracts of time\r\nwhich lie within our own knowledge and observation. When I see the life\r\nof a great man, who has deserved well of his country, after having\r\nstruggled through all the oppositions of prejudice and envy, breaking\r\nout with lustre, and shining forth in all the splendour of success, I\r\nclose my book, and am a happy man for a whole evening.\r\n\r\nBut since in history events are of a mixed nature, and often happen\r\nalike to the worthless and the deserving, insomuch that we frequently\r\nsee a virtuous man dying in the midst of disappointments and calamities,\r\nand the vicious ending their days in prosperity and peace, I love to\r\namuse myself with the accounts I meet with in fabulous histories and\r\nfictions: for in this kind of writings we have always the pleasure of\r\nseeing vice punished, and virtue rewarded. Indeed, were we able to view\r\na man in the whole circle of his existence, we should have the\r\nsatisfaction of seeing it close with happiness or misery, according to\r\nhis proper merit: but though our view of him is interrupted by death\r\nbefore the finishing of his adventures (if I may so speak), we may be\r\nsure that the conclusion and catastrophe is altogether suitable to his\r\nbehaviour. On the contrary, the whole being of a man, considered as a\r\nhero, or a knight-errant, is comprehended within the limits of a poem or\r\nromance, and therefore always ends to our satisfaction; so that\r\ninventions of this kind are like food and exercise to a good-natured\r\ndisposition, which they please and gratify at the same time that they\r\nnourish and strengthen. The greater the affliction is in which we see\r\nour favourites in these relations engaged, the greater is the pleasure\r\nwe take in seeing them relieved.\r\n\r\nAmong the many feigned histories which I have met with in my reading,\r\nthere is none in which the hero's perplexity is greater, and the winding\r\nout of it more difficult, than that in a French author whose name I have\r\nforgot. It so happens, that the hero's mistress was the sister of his\r\nmost intimate friend, who for certain reasons was given out to be dead,\r\nwhile he was preparing to leave his country in quest of adventures. The\r\nhero having heard of his friend's death, immediately repaired to his\r\nmistress, to condole with her, and comfort her. Upon his arrival in her\r\ngarden, he discovered at a distance a man clasped in her arms, and\r\nembraced with the most endearing tenderness. What should he do? It did\r\nnot consist with the gentleness of a knight-errant either to kill his\r\nmistress, or the man whom she was pleased to favour. At the same time,\r\nit would have spoiled a romance, should he have laid violent hands on\r\nhimself. In short, he immediately entered upon his adventures; and after\r\na long series of exploits, found out by degrees, that the person he saw\r\nin his mistress's arms was her own brother, taking leave of her before\r\nhe left his country, and the embrace she gave him nothing else but the\r\naffectionate farewell of a sister: so that he had at once the two\r\ngreatest satisfactions that could enter into the heart of man, in\r\nfinding his friend alive, whom he thought dead; and his mistress\r\nfaithful, whom he had believed inconstant.\r\n\r\nThere are indeed some disasters so very fatal, that it is impossible for\r\nany accidents to rectify them. Of this kind was that of poor Lucretia;\r\nand yet we see Ovid has found an expedient even in this case. He\r\ndescribes a beautiful and royal virgin walking on the seashore, where\r\nshe was discovered by Neptune, and violated after a long and\r\nunsuccessful importunity. To mitigate her sorrow, he offers her whatever\r\nshe would wish for. Never certainly was the wit of woman more puzzled in\r\nfinding out a stratagem to retrieve her honour. Had she desired to be\r\nchanged into a stock or stone, a beast, fish or fowl, she would have\r\nbeen a loser by it: or had she desired to have been made a sea-nymph, or\r\na goddess, her immortality would but have perpetuated her disgrace.\r\n\"Give me therefore,\" said she, \"such a shape as may make me incapable of\r\nsuffering again the like calamity, or of being reproached for what I\r\nhave already suffered.\" To be short, she was turned into a man, and by\r\nthat only means avoided the danger and imputation she so much dreaded.\r\n\r\nI was once myself in agonies of grief that are unutterable, and in so\r\ngreat a distraction of mind, that I thought myself even out of the\r\npossibility of receiving comfort. The occasion was as follows: When I\r\nwas a youth in a part of the army which was then quartered at Dover, I\r\nfell in love with an agreeable young woman, of a good family in those\r\nparts, and had the satisfaction of seeing my addresses kindly received,\r\nwhich occasioned the perplexity I am going to relate.\r\n\r\nWe were in a calm evening diverting ourselves upon the top of the cliff\r\nwith the prospect of the sea, and trifling away the time in such little\r\nfondnesses as are most ridiculous to people in business, and most\r\nagreeable to those in love.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these our innocent endearments, she snatched a paper of\r\nverses out of my hand, and ran away with them. I was following her, when\r\non a sudden the ground, though at a considerable distance from the verge\r\nof the precipice, sank under her, and threw her down from so prodigious\r\na height upon such a range of rocks, as would have dashed her into ten\r\nthousand pieces, had her body been made of adamant. It is much easier\r\nfor my reader to imagine my state of mind upon such an occasion, than\r\nfor me to express it. I said to myself, \"It is not in the power of\r\nheaven to relieve me!\" when I awoke, equally transported and astonished,\r\nto see myself drawn out of an affliction which the very moment before\r\nappeared to me altogether inextricable.\r\n\r\nThe impressions of grief and horror were so lively on this occasion,\r\nthat while they lasted, they made me more miserable than I was at the\r\nreal death of this beloved person (which happened a few months after, at\r\na time when the match between us was concluded), inasmuch as the\r\nimaginary death was untimely, and I myself in a sort an accessory;\r\nwhereas her real decease had at least these alleviations, of being\r\nnatural and inevitable.\r\n\r\nThe memory of the dream I have related still dwells so strongly upon me,\r\nthat I can never read the description of Dover Cliff in Shakespeare's\r\ntragedy of \"King Lear,\"[11] without a fresh sense of my escape. The\r\nprospect from that place is drawn with such proper incidents, that\r\nwhoever can read it without growing giddy, must have a good head, or a\r\nvery bad one.\r\n\r\n    \"_Come on, sir, here's the place; stand still! How fearful\r\n    And dizzy 'tis to cast one's eyes so low?\r\n    The crows and choughs that wing the midway air,\r\n    Show scarce as gross as beetles. Half-way down\r\n    Hangs one that gathers samphire. Dreadful trade!\r\n    Methinks he seems no bigger than his head.\r\n    The fishermen that walk upon the beach,\r\n    Appear like mice, and yond' tall anchoring bark\r\n    Diminished to her boat;[12] her boat![12] a buoy\r\n    Almost too small for sight.

Some of the deceased, who I thought had been laid quietly in their\r\ngraves, are such hobgoblins in public assemblies, that I must be forced\r\nto deal with them as Evander did with his triple-lived adversary, who,\r\naccording to Virgil, was forced to kill him thrice over before he could\r\ndespatch him.\r\n\r\n    \"_Ter leto sternendus erat._\"[15]\r\n\r\nI am likewise informed, that several wives of my dead men have, since\r\nthe decease of their husbands, been seen in many public places without\r\nmourning, or regard to common decency.\r\n\r\nI am further advised, that several of the defunct, contrary to the\r\nWoollen Act,[16] presume to dress themselves in lace, embroidery, silks,\r\nmuslins, and other ornaments forbidden to persons in their condition.\r\nThese and other the like informations moving me thereunto, I must\r\ndesire, for distinction-sake, and to conclude this subject for ever,\r\nthat when any of these posthumous persons appear, or are spoken of,\r\ntheir wives may be called \"widows\"; their houses, \"sepulchres\"; their\r\nchariots, \"hearses\"; and their garments, \"flannel\": on which condition,\r\nthey shall be allowed all the conveniences that dead men can in reason\r\ndesire.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs I was writing this morning on this subject, I received the following\r\nletter:\r\n\r\n     \"MR.

We live very lovingly together; for as death makes\r\n     us all equal, it makes us very much delight in one another's\r\n     company. Our time passes away much after the same manner as it did\r\n     when we were among you: eating, drinking, and sleeping, are our\r\n     chief diversions.

We that are the\r\n     sprightly geniuses of the place, refresh ourselves frequently with\r\n     a bottle of mum,[17] and tell stories till we fall asleep. You\r\n     would do well to send among us Mr. Dodwell's[18] book against the\r\n     immortality of the soul, which would be of great consolation to our\r\n     whole fraternity, who would be very glad to find that they are dead\r\n     for good and all, and would in particular make me rest for ever,\r\n\r\n                                                \"Yours,\r\n                                                     \"JOHN PARTRIDGE.\r\n\r\n     \"P.S.--Sir James[19] is just arrived here in good health.\"\r\n\r\nThe foregoing letter was the more pleasing to me, because I perceive\r\nsome little symptoms in it of a resuscitation; and having lately seen\r\nthe predictions of this author, which are written in a true Protestant\r\nspirit of prophecy, and a particular zeal against the French king, I\r\nhave some thoughts of sending for him from the Banks of Styx, and\r\nreinstating him in his own house, at the sign of the Globe in Salisbury\r\nStreet.

For these\r\n     several years past, there was not a hare in the county that could\r\n     be at rest for him; and I think, the greatest exploit he ever\r\n     boasted of, was, that when he was high sheriff of the county, he\r\n     hunted a fox so far, that he could not follow him any farther by\r\n     the laws of the land.

And since it is presumed your\r\n     worship will not suppress them by force, your petitioner humbly\r\n     desires you would order, that ruffs may be added to the dress; and\r\n     that she may be heard by her counsel, who has assured your\r\n     petitioner, he has such cogent reasons to offer to your court, that\r\n     ruffs and farthingales are inseparable; and that he questions not\r\n     but two-thirds of the greatest beauties about town will have\r\n     cambric collars on their necks before the end of Easter Term next.\r\n     He further says, that the design of our great-grandmothers in this\r\n     petticoat, was to appear much bigger than the life; for which\r\n     reason, they had false shoulder-blades, like wings, and the ruff\r\n     above mentioned, to make their upper and lower parts of their\r\n     bodies appear proportionable; whereas the figure of a woman in the\r\n     present dress, bears (as he calls it) the figure of a cone, which\r\n     (as he advises) is the same with that of an extinguisher, with a\r\n     little knob at the upper end, and widening downward, till it ends\r\n     in a basis of a most enormous circumference.\r\n\r\n     \"Your petitioner therefore most humbly prays, that you would\r\n     restore the ruff to the farthingale, which in their nature ought to\r\n     be as inseparable as the two Hungarian twins.[23]\r\n\r\n                               \"And your Petitioner shall ever pray.\"\r\n\r\nI have examined into the allegations of this petition, and find, by\r\nseveral ancient pictures of my own predecessors, particularly that of\r\nDame Deborah Bickerstaff, my great-grandmother, that the ruff and\r\nfarthingale are made use of as absolutely necessary to preserve the\r\nsymmetry of the figure; and Mrs. Pyramid Bickerstaff, her second sister,\r\nis recorded in our family-book, with some observations to her\r\ndisadvantage, as the first female of our house that discovered, to any\r\nbesides her nurse and her husband, an inch below her chin or above her\r\ninstep. This convinces me of the reasonableness of Mrs. Prim's demand;\r\nand therefore I shall not allow the reviving of any one part of that\r\nancient mode, except the whole is complied with.

[ADDISON.\r\n\r\nFrom _Tuesday, Jan. 10_, to _Thursday, Jan. 12, 1709-10_.\r\n\r\n    In tenui labor.--VIRG., Georg. iv. 6.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sheer Lane, January 11._\r\n\r\nI have lately applied myself with much satisfaction to the curious\r\ndiscoveries that have been made by the help of microscopes, as they are\r\nrelated by authors of our own and other nations. There is a great deal\r\nof pleasure in prying into this world of wonders, which Nature has laid\r\nout of sight, and seems industrious to conceal from us. Philosophy had\r\nranged over all the visible creation, and began to want objects for her\r\ninquiries, when the present age, by the invention of glasses, opened a\r\nnew and inexhaustible magazine of rarities, more wonderful and amazing\r\nthan any of those which astonished our forefathers. I was yesterday\r\namusing myself with speculations of this kind, and reflecting upon\r\nmyriads of animals that swim in those little seas of juices that are\r\ncontained in the several vessels of a human body. While my mind was thus\r\nfilled with that secret wonder and delight, I could not but look upon\r\nmyself as in an act of devotion, and am very well pleased with the\r\nthought of the great heathen anatomist,[24] who calls his description of\r\nthe parts of a human body, \"A Hymn to the Supreme Being.\" The reading of\r\nthe day produced in my imagination an agreeable morning's dream, if I\r\nmay call it such; for I am still in doubt, whether it passed in my\r\nsleeping or waking thoughts. However it was, I fancied that my good\r\ngenius stood at my bed's head, and entertained me with the following\r\ndiscourse; for upon my rising, it dwelt so strongly upon me, that I\r\nwrote down the substance of it, if not the very words.\r\n\r\n\"If,\" said he, \"you can be so transported with those productions of\r\nnature which are discovered to you by those artificial eyes that are the\r\nworks of human invention, how great will your surprise be, when you\r\nshall have it in your power to model your own eye as you please, and\r\nadapt it to the bulk of objects, which, with all these helps, are by\r\ninfinite degrees too minute for your perception. We who are unbodied\r\nspirits can sharpen our sight to what degree we think fit, and make the\r\nleast work of the creation distinct and visible. This gives us such\r\nideas as cannot possibly enter into your present conceptions. There is\r\nnot the least particle of matter which may not furnish one of us\r\nsufficient employment for a whole eternity. We can still divide it, and\r\nstill open it, and still discover new wonders of Providence, as we look\r\ninto the different texture of its parts, and meet with beds of\r\nvegetables, mineral and metallic mixtures, and several kinds of animals\r\nthat lie hid, and as it were lost in such an endless fund of matter. I\r\nfind you are surprised at this discourse; but as your reason tells you\r\nthere are infinite parts in the smallest portion of matter, it will\r\nlikewise convince you, that there is as great a variety of secrets, and\r\nas much room for discoveries, in a particle no bigger than the point of\r\na pin, as in the globe of the whole earth. Your microscopes bring to\r\nsight shoals of living creatures in a spoonful of vinegar; but we who\r\ncan distinguish them in their different magnitudes, see among them\r\nseveral huge leviathans, that terrify the little fry of animals about\r\nthem, and take their pastime as in an ocean, or the great deep.\" I could\r\nnot but smile at this part of his relation, and told him, I doubted not\r\nbut he could give me the history of several invisible giants,\r\naccompanied with their respective dwarfs, in case that any of these\r\nlittle beings are of a human shape. \"You may assure yourself,\" said he,\r\n\"that we see in these little animals different natures, instincts and\r\nmodes of life, which correspond to what you observe in creatures of\r\nbigger dimensions. We descry millions of species subsisted on a green\r\nleaf, which your glasses represent only in crowds and swarms. What\r\nappears to your eye but as hair or down rising on the surface of it, we\r\nfind to be woods and forests, inhabited by beasts of prey, that are as\r\ndreadful in those their little haunts, as lions and tigers in the\r\ndeserts of Libya.\" I was much delighted with his discourse, and could\r\nnot forbear telling him, that I should be wonderfully pleased to see a\r\nnatural history of imperceptibles, containing a true account of such\r\nvegetables and animals as grow and live out of sight. \"Such\r\ndisquisitions,\" answered he, \"are very suitable to reasonable creatures;\r\nand you may be sure, there are many curious spirits amongst us who\r\nemploy themselves in such amusements. For as our hands, and all our\r\nsenses, may be formed to what degree of strength and delicacy we please,\r\nin the same manner as our sight, we can make what experiments we are\r\ninclined to, how small soever the matter be in which we make them. I\r\nhave been present at the dissection of a mite, and have seen the\r\nskeleton of a flea. I have been shown a forest of numberless trees,\r\nwhich has been picked out of an acorn. Your microscope can show you in\r\nit a complete oak in miniature; and could you suit all your organs as we\r\ndo, you might pluck an acorn from this little oak, which contains\r\nanother tree; and so proceed from tree to tree, as long as you would\r\nthink fit to continue your disquisitions. It is almost impossible,\"\r\nadded he, \"to talk of things so remote from common life, and the\r\nordinary notions which mankind receive from blunt and gross organs of\r\nsense, without appearing extravagant and ridiculous. You have often seen\r\na dog opened, to observe the circulation of the blood, or make any other\r\nuseful inquiry; and yet would be tempted to laugh if I should tell you,\r\nthat a circle of much greater philosophers than any of the Royal\r\nSociety, were present at the cutting up of one of those little animals\r\nwhich we find in the blue of a plum: that it was tied down alive before\r\nthem; and that they observed the palpitations of the heart, the course\r\nof the blood, the working of the muscles, and the convulsions in the\r\nseveral limbs, with great accuracy and improvement.\" \"I must confess,\"\r\nsaid I, \"for my own part, I go along with you in all your discoveries\r\nwith great pleasure; but it is certain, they are too fine for the gross\r\nof mankind, who are more struck with the description of everything that\r\nis great and bulky. Accordingly we find the best judge of human nature\r\nsetting forth his wisdom, not in the formation of these minute animals\r\n(though indeed no less wonderful than the other) but in that of the\r\nleviathan and behemoth, the horse and the crocodile.\"[25] \"Your\r\nobservation,\" said he, \"is very just; and I must acknowledge for my own\r\npart, that although it is with much delight that I see the traces of\r\nProvidence in these instances, I still take greater pleasure in\r\nconsidering the works of the creation in their immensity, than in their\r\nminuteness. For this reason, I rejoice when I strengthen my sight so as\r\nto make it pierce into the most remote spaces, and take a view of those\r\nheavenly bodies which lie out of the reach of human eyes, though\r\nassisted by telescopes. What you look upon as one confused white in the\r\nMilky Way, appears to me a long tract of heavens, distinguished by stars\r\nthat are ranged in proper figures and constellations. While you are\r\nadmiring the sky in a starry night, I am entertained with a variety of\r\nworlds and suns placed one above another, and rising up to such an\r\nimmense distance, that no created eye can see an end of them.\"\r\n\r\nThe latter part of his discourse flung me into such an astonishment,\r\nthat he had been silent for some time before I took notice of it; when\r\non a sudden I started up and drew my curtains, to look if any one was\r\nnear me, but saw nobody, and cannot tell to this moment whether it was\r\nmy good genius or a dream that left me.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: Galen, \"De Usu Partium.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: See Job, chaps. 39-41.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 120.

Youth\r\nis devoted to lust, middle age to ambition, old age to avarice. These\r\nare the three general motives and principles of action both in good and\r\nbad men; though it must be acknowledged, that they change their names,\r\nand resign their natures, according to the temper of the person whom\r\nthey direct and animate. For with the good, lust becomes virtuous love;\r\nambition, true honour; and avarice, the care of posterity. This scheme\r\nof thought amused me very agreeably till I retired to rest, and\r\nafterwards formed itself into a pleasing and regular vision, which I\r\nshall describe in all its circumstances, as the objects presented\r\nthemselves, whether in a serious or ridiculous manner.\r\n\r\nI dreamed that I was in a wood, of so prodigious an extent, and cut into\r\nsuch a variety of walks and alleys, that all mankind were lost and\r\nbewildered in it. After having wandered up and down some time, I came\r\ninto the centre of it, which opened into a wide plain, that was filled\r\nwith multitudes of both sexes. I here discovered three great roads, very\r\nwide and long, that led into three different parts of the forest. On a\r\nsudden, the whole multitude broke into three parts, according to their\r\ndifferent ages, and marched in their respective bodies into the three\r\ngreat roads that lay before them. As I had a mind to know how each of\r\nthese roads terminated, and whither it would lead those who passed\r\nthrough them, I joined myself with the assembly that were in the flower\r\nand vigour of their age, and called themselves, \"The Band of Lovers.\" I\r\nfound to my great surprise, that several old men besides myself had\r\nintruded into this agreeable company; as I had before observed, there\r\nwere some young men who had united themselves to the Band of Misers, and\r\nwere walking up the path of avarice; though both made a very ridiculous\r\nfigure, and were as much laughed at by those they joined, as by those\r\nthey forsook. The walk which we marched up, for thickness of shades,\r\nembroidery of flowers, and melody of birds, with the distant purling of\r\nstreams, and falls of water, was so wonderfully delightful, that it\r\ncharmed our senses, and intoxicated our minds with pleasure. We had not\r\nbeen long here, before every man singled out some woman to whom he\r\noffered his addresses and professed himself a lover; when on a sudden we\r\nperceived this delicious walk to grow more narrow as we advanced in it,\r\ntill it ended in many intricate thickets, mazes and labyrinths, that\r\nwere so mixed with roses and brambles, brakes of thorns, and beds of\r\nflowers, rocky paths and pleasing grottoes, that it was hard to say,\r\nwhether it gave greater delight or perplexity to those who travelled in\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIt was here that the lovers began to be eager in their pursuits. Some of\r\ntheir mistresses, who only seemed to retire for the sake of form and\r\ndecency, led them into plantations that were disposed into regular\r\nwalks; where, after they had wheeled about in some turns and windings,\r\nthey suffered themselves to be overtaken, and gave their hands to those\r\nwho pursued them. Others withdrew from their followers into little\r\nwildernesses, where there were so many paths interwoven with each other\r\nin so much confusion and irregularity, that several of the lovers\r\nquitted the pursuit, or broke their hearts in the chase. It was\r\nsometimes very odd to see a man pursuing a fine woman that was following\r\nanother, whose eye was fixed upon a fourth, that had her own game in\r\nview in some other quarter of the wilderness. I could not but observe\r\ntwo things in this place which I thought very particular, that several\r\npersons who stood only at the end of the avenues, and cast a careless\r\neye upon the nymphs during their whole flight, often caught them, when\r\nthose who pressed them the most warmly through all their turns and\r\ndoubles, were wholly unsuccessful: and that some of my own age, who were\r\nat first looked upon with aversion and contempt, by being well\r\nacquainted with the wilderness, and by dodging their women in the\r\nparticular corners and alleys of it, caught them in their arms, and took\r\nthem from those they really loved and admired. There was a particular\r\ngrove, which was called, \"The Labyrinth of Coquettes\"; where many were\r\nenticed to the chase, but few returned with purchase. It was pleasant\r\nenough to see a celebrated beauty, by smiling upon one, casting a glance\r\nupon another, beckoning to a third, and adapting her charms and graces\r\nto the several follies of those that admired her, drawing into the\r\nlabyrinth a whole pack of lovers, that lost themselves in the maze, and\r\nnever could find their way out of it. However, it was some satisfaction\r\nto me, to see many of the fair ones who had thus deluded their\r\nfollowers, and left them among the intricacies of the labyrinth, obliged\r\nwhen they came out of it, to surrender to the first partner that\r\noffered himself. I now had crossed over all the difficult and perplexed\r\npassages that seemed to bound our walk, when on the other side of them,\r\nI saw the same great road running on a little way, till it was\r\nterminated by two beautiful temples. I stood here for some time, and saw\r\nmost of the multitude who had been dispersed amongst the thickets,\r\ncoming out two by two, and marching up in pairs towards the temples that\r\nstood before us. The structure on the right hand was (as I afterwards\r\nfound) consecrated to virtuous love, and could not be entered but by\r\nsuch as received a ring, or some other token, from a person who was\r\nplaced as a guard at the gate of it. He wore a garland of roses and\r\nmyrtles on his head, and on his shoulders a robe like an imperial\r\nmantle, white and unspotted all over, excepting only, that where it was\r\nclasped at his breast, there were two golden turtle-doves that buttoned\r\nit by their bills, which were wrought in rubies. He was called by the\r\nname of Hymen, and was seated near the entrance of the temple, in a\r\ndelicious bower, made up of several trees, that were embraced by\r\nwoodbines, jessamines, and amaranths, which were as so many emblems of\r\nmarriage, and ornaments to the trunks that supported them. As I was\r\nsingle and unaccompanied, I was not permitted to enter the temple, and\r\nfor that reason am a stranger to all the mysteries that were performed\r\nin it. I had however the curiosity to observe how the several couples\r\nthat entered were disposed of; which was after the following manner.\r\nThere were two great gates on the back side of the edifice, at which the\r\nwhole crowd was let out. At one of these gates were two women, extremely\r\nbeautiful, though in a different kind, the one having a very careful and\r\ncomposed air, the other a sort of smile and ineffable sweetness in her\r\ncountenance. The name of the first was Discretion, and of the other\r\nComplacency, All who came out of this gate, and put themselves under the\r\ndirection of these two sisters, were immediately conducted by them into\r\ngardens, groves, and meadows, which abounded in delights, and were\r\nfurnished with everything that could make them the proper seats of\r\nhappiness. The second gate of this temple let out all the couples that\r\nwere unhappily married, who came out linked together by chains, which\r\neach of them strove to break, but could not. Several of these were such\r\nas had never been acquainted with each other before they met in the\r\ngreat walk, or had been too well acquainted in the thicket. The entrance\r\nto this gate was possessed by three sisters, who joined themselves with\r\nthese wretches, and occasioned most of their miseries. The youngest of\r\nthe sisters was known by the name of Levity, who with the innocence of a\r\nvirgin, had the dress and behaviour of a harlot. The name of the second\r\nwas Contention, who bore on her right arm a muff made of the skin of a\r\nporcupine; and on her left carried a little lap-dog, that barked and\r\nsnapped at every one that passed by her.\r\n\r\nThe eldest of the sisters, who seemed to have a haughty and imperious\r\nair, was always accompanied with a tawny Cupid, who generally marched\r\nbefore her with a little mace on his shoulder, the end of which was\r\nfashioned into the horns of a stag. Her garments were yellow, and her\r\ncomplexion pale. Her eyes were piercing, but had odd casts in them, and\r\nthat particular distemper, which makes persons who are troubled with it,\r\nsee objects double. Upon inquiry, I was informed that her name was\r\nJealousy.\r\n\r\nHaving finished my observations upon this temple, and its votaries, I\r\nrepaired to that which stood on the left hand, and was called, \"The\r\nTemple of Lust.\" The front of it was raised on Corinthian pillars, with\r\nall the meretricious ornaments that accompany that order; whereas that\r\nof the other was composed of the chaste and matronlike Ionic. The sides\r\nof it were adorned with several grotesque figures of goats, sparrows,\r\nheathen gods, satyrs, and monsters made up of half-man half-beast. The\r\ngates were unguarded, and open to all that had a mind to enter. Upon my\r\ngoing in, I found the windows were blinded, and let in only a kind of\r\ntwilight, that served to discover a prodigious number of dark corners\r\nand apartments, into which the whole temple was divided. I was here\r\nstunned with a mixed noise of clamour and jollity: on one side of me, I\r\nheard singing and dancing; on the other, brawls and clashing of swords.\r\nIn short, I was so little pleased with the place, that I was going out\r\nof it; but found I could not return by the gate where I entered, which\r\nwas barred against all that were come in, with bolts of iron, and locks\r\nof adamant. There was no going back from this temple through the paths\r\nof pleasure which led to it: all who passed through the ceremonies of\r\nthe place, went out at an iron wicket, which was kept by a dreadful\r\ngiant called Remorse, that held a scourge of scorpions in his hand, and\r\ndrove them into the only outlet from that temple. This was a passage so\r\nrugged, so uneven, and choked with so many thorns and briars, that it\r\nwas a melancholy spectacle to behold the pains and difficulties which\r\nboth sexes suffered who walked through it. The men, though in the prime\r\nof their youth, appeared weak and enfeebled with old age: the women\r\nwrung their hands, and tore their hair; and several lost their limbs\r\nbefore they could extricate themselves out of the perplexities of the\r\npath in which they were engaged. The remaining part of this vision, and\r\nthe adventures I met with in the two great roads of ambition and\r\navarice, must be the subject of another paper.\r\n\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT.\r\n\r\nI have this morning received the following letter from the famous Mr.\r\nThomas Doggett:[26]\r\n\r\n     \"SIR,\r\n\r\n     \"On Monday next will be acted for my benefit, the comedy of 'Love\r\n     for Love': if you will do me the honour to appear there, I will\r\n     publish on the bills, that it is to be performed at the request of\r\n     Isaac Bickerstaff, Esq.; and question not but it will bring me as\r\n     great an audience, as ever was at the house since the Morocco\r\n     ambassador was there.[27] I am, (with the greatest respect)\r\n\r\n                                       \"Your most obedient and\r\n                                            \"Most humble Servant,\r\n                                                    \"THOMAS DOGGETT.\"\r\n\r\nBeing naturally an encourager of wit, as well as bound to it in the\r\nquality of censor, I returned the following answer:\r\n\r\n     \"MR.

When it lay in my power to\r\nremove the distress of an unhappy person, I thought I should very ill\r\nemploy my time in attending matters of speculation, and therefore\r\ndesired the lady would walk in. When she entered, I saw her eyes full of\r\ntears. However, her grief was not so great as to make her omit rules;\r\nfor she was very long and exact in her civilities, which gave me time to\r\nview and consider her. Her clothes were very rich, but tarnished; and\r\nher words very fine, but ill applied. These distinctions made me without\r\nhesitation (though I had never seen her before) ask her, if her lady had\r\nany commands for me? She then began to weep afresh, and with many broken\r\nsighs told me, that their family was in very great affliction. I\r\nbeseeched her to compose herself, for that I might possibly be capable\r\nof assisting them. She then cast her eye upon my little dog, and was\r\nagain transported with too much passion to proceed; but with much ado,\r\nshe at last gave me to understand, that Cupid, her lady's lap-dog, was\r\ndangerously ill, and in so bad a condition, that her lady neither saw\r\ncompany, nor went abroad, for which reason she did not come herself to\r\nconsult me; that as I had mentioned with great affection my own dog\r\n(here she curtsied, and looking first at the cur, and then on me, said,\r\nindeed I had reason, for he was very pretty) her lady sent to me rather\r\nthan to any other doctor, and hoped I would not laugh at her sorrow, but\r\nsend her my advice. I must confess, I had some indignation to find\r\nmyself treated like something below a farrier; yet well knowing, that\r\nthe best, as well as most tender way of dealing with a woman, is to fall\r\nin with her humours, and by that means to let her see the absurdity of\r\nthem, I proceeded accordingly: \"Pray, madam,\" said I, \"can you give me\r\nany methodical account of this illness, and how Cupid was first taken?\"\r\n\"Sir,\" said she, \"we have a little ignorant country girl who is kept to\r\ntend him: she was recommended to our family by one, that my lady never\r\nsaw but once, at a visit; and you know, persons of quality are always\r\ninclined to strangers; for I could have helped her to a cousin of my\r\nown, but----\" \"Good madam,\" said I, \"you neglect the account of the sick\r\nbody, while you are complaining of this girl.\" \"No, no, sir,\" said she,\r\n\"begging your pardon: but it is the general fault of physicians, they\r\nare so in haste, that they never hear out the case. I say, this silly\r\ngirl, after washing Cupid, let him stand half an hour in the window\r\nwithout his collar, where he caught cold, and in an hour after began to\r\nbark very hoarse. He had however a pretty good night, and we hoped the\r\ndanger was over; but for these two nights last past, neither he nor my\r\nlady have slept a wink.\" \"Has he,\" said I, \"taken anything?\" \"No,\" said\r\nshe, \"but my lady says, he shall take anything that you prescribe,\r\nprovided you do not make use of Jesuits' powder[29], or the cold bath.\r\nPoor Cupid,\" continued she, \"has always been phthisical, and as he lies\r\nunder something like a chin-cough, we are afraid it will end in a\r\nconsumption.\" I then asked her, if she had brought any of his water to\r\nshow me. Upon this, she stared me in the face, and said, \"I am afraid,\r\nMr. Bickerstaff, you are not serious; but if you have any receipt that\r\nis proper on this occasion, pray let us have it; for my mistress is not\r\nto be comforted.\" Upon this, I paused a little without returning any\r\nanswer, and after some short silence, I proceeded in the following\r\nmanner: \"I have considered the nature of the distemper, and the\r\nconstitution of the patient, and by the best observation that I can make\r\non both, I think it is safest to put him into a course of kitchen\r\nphysic. In the meantime, to remove his hoarseness, it will be the most\r\nnatural way to make Cupid his own druggist; for which reason, I shall\r\nprescribe to him, three mornings successively, as much powder as will\r\nlie on a groat, of that noble remedy which the apothecaries call 'Album\r\nGræcum.'\" Upon hearing this advice, the young woman smiled, as if she\r\nknew how ridiculous an errand she had been employed in; and indeed I\r\nfound by the sequel of her discourse, that she was an arch baggage, and\r\nof a character that is frequent enough in persons of her employment, who\r\nare so used to conform themselves in everything to the humours and\r\npassions of their mistresses, that they sacrifice superiority of sense\r\nto superiority of condition, and are insensibly betrayed into the\r\npassions and prejudices of those whom they serve, without giving\r\nthemselves leave to consider, that they are extravagant and ridiculous.\r\nHowever I thought it very natural, when her eyes were thus open, to see\r\nher give a new turn to her discourse, and from sympathising with her\r\nmistress in her follies, to fall a-railing at her. \"You cannot imagine,\"\r\nsaid she, \"Mr. Bickerstaff, what a life she makes us lead for the sake\r\nof this little ugly cur: if he dies, we are the most unhappy family in\r\ntown. She chanced to lose a parrot last year, which, to tell you truly,\r\nbrought me into her service; for she turned off her woman upon it, who\r\nhad lived with her ten years, because she neglected to give him water,\r\nthough every one of the family says, she was as innocent of the bird's\r\ndeath as the babe that is unborn. Nay, she told me this very morning,\r\nthat if Cupid should die, she would send the poor innocent wench I was\r\ntelling you of, to Bridewell, and have the milkwoman tried for her life\r\nat the Old Bailey, for putting water into his milk. In short, she talks\r\nlike any distracted creature.\"\r\n\r\n\"Since it is so, young woman,\" said I, \"I will by no means let you\r\noffend her, by staying on this message longer than is absolutely\r\nnecessary,\" and so forced her out.\r\n\r\nWhile I am studying to cure those evils and distresses that are\r\nnecessary or natural to human life, I find my task growing upon me,\r\nsince by these accidental cares, and acquired calamities, if I may so\r\ncall them, my patients contract distempers to which their constitution\r\nis of itself a stranger. But this is an evil I have for many years\r\nremarked in the fair sex; and as they are by nature very much formed for\r\naffection and dalliance, I have observed, that when by too obstinate a\r\ncruelty, or any other means, they have disappointed themselves of the\r\nproper objects of love, as husbands, or children, such virgins have\r\nexactly at such a year grown fond of lap-dogs, parrots, or other\r\nanimals. I know at this time a celebrated toast, whom I allow to be one\r\nof the most agreeable of her sex, that in the presence of her admirers,\r\nwill give a torrent of kisses to her cat, any one of which a Christian\r\nwould be glad of. I do not at the same time deny, but there are as great\r\nenormities of this kind committed by our sex as theirs. A Roman emperor\r\nhad so very great an esteem for a horse of his, that he had thoughts of\r\nmaking him a consul; and several moderns of that rank of men whom we\r\ncall country squires, won't scruple to kiss their hounds before all the\r\nworld, and declare in the presence of their wives, that they had rather\r\nsalute a favourite of the pack, than the finest woman in England. These\r\nvoluntary friendships between animals of different species, seem to\r\narise from instinct; for which reason, I have always looked upon the\r\nmutual goodwill between the squire and the hound, to be of the same\r\nnature with that between the lion and the jackal.\r\n\r\nThe only extravagance of this kind which appears to me excusable, is one\r\nthat grew out of an excess of gratitude, which I have somewhere met with\r\nin the life of a Turkish emperor. His horse had brought him safe out of\r\na field of battle, and from the pursuit of a victorious enemy. As a\r\nreward for such his good and faithful service, his master built him a\r\nstable of marble, shod him with gold, fed him in an ivory manger, and\r\nmade him a rack of silver. He annexed to the stable several fields and\r\nmeadows, lakes, and running streams. At the same time he provided for\r\nhim a seraglio of mares, the most beautiful that could be found in the\r\nwhole Ottoman Empire. To these were added a suitable train of domestics,\r\nconsisting of grooms, farriers, rubbers, &c., accommodated with proper\r\nliveries and pensions. In short, nothing was omitted that could\r\ncontribute to the ease and happiness of his life who had preserved the\r\nemperor's.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBy reason of the extreme cold, and the changeableness of the weather, I\r\nhave been prevailed upon to allow the free use of the farthingale, till\r\nthe 20th of February next ensuing.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: Peruvian Bark, then comparatively little used.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 122.

Prol. 21.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, January 18._\r\n\r\nI find it is thought necessary, that I (who have taken upon me to\r\ncensure the irregularities of the age) should give an account of my own\r\nactions when they appear doubtful, or subject to misconstruction. My\r\nappearing at the play on Monday last,[30] is looked upon as a step in my\r\nconduct, which I ought to explain, that others may not be misled by my\r\nexample. It is true in matter of fact, I was present at the ingenious\r\nentertainment of that day, and placed myself in a box which was prepared\r\nfor me with great civility and distinction. It is said of Virgil, when\r\nhe entered a Roman theatre, where there were many thousands of\r\nspectators present, that the whole assembly rose up to do him honour; a\r\nrespect which was never before paid to any but the emperor. I must\r\nconfess, that universal clap, and other testimonies of applause, with\r\nwhich I was received at my first appearance in the theatre of Great\r\nBritain, gave me as sensible a delight, as the above-mentioned reception\r\ncould give to that immortal poet. I should be ungrateful at the same\r\ntime, if I did not take this opportunity of acknowledging the great\r\ncivilities that were shown me by Mr. Thomas Doggett, who made his\r\ncompliments to me between the acts, after a most ingenuous and discreet\r\nmanner; and at the same time communicated to me, that the Company of\r\nUpholders desired to receive me at their door at the end of the\r\nHaymarket, and to light me home to my lodgings. That part of the\r\nceremony I forbad, and took particular care during the whole play to\r\nobserve the conduct of the drama, and give no offence by my own\r\nbehaviour. Here I think it will not be foreign to my character, to lay\r\ndown the proper duties of an audience, and what is incumbent upon each\r\nindividual spectator in public diversions of this nature. Every one\r\nshould on these occasions show his attention, understanding and virtue.\r\nI would undertake to find out all the persons of sense and breeding by\r\nthe effect of a single sentence, and to distinguish a gentleman as much\r\nby his laugh, as his bow. When we see the footman and his lord diverted\r\nby the same jest, it very much turns to the diminution of the one, or\r\nthe honour of the other. But though a man's quality may appear in his\r\nunderstanding and taste, the regard to virtue ought to be the same in\r\nall ranks and conditions of men, however they make a profession of it\r\nunder the name of honour, religion, or morality. When therefore we see\r\nanything divert an audience, either in tragedy or comedy, that strikes\r\nat the duties of civil life, or exposes what the best men in all ages\r\nhave looked upon as sacred and inviolable, it is the certain sign of a\r\nprofligate race of men, who are fallen from the virtue of their\r\nforefathers, and will be contemptible in the eyes of their posterity.\r\nFor this reason I took great delight in seeing the generous and\r\ndisinterested passion of the lovers in this comedy (which stood so many\r\ntrials, and was proved by such a variety of diverting incidents)\r\nreceived with an universal approbation. This brings to my mind a passage\r\nin Cicero,[31] which I could never read without being in love with the\r\nvirtue of a Roman audience. He there describes the shouts and applause\r\nwhich the people gave to the persons who acted the parts of Pylades and\r\nOrestes, in the noblest occasion that a poet could invent to show\r\nfriendship in perfection. One of them had forfeited his life by an\r\naction which he had committed; and as they stood in judgment before the\r\ntyrant, each of them strove who should be the criminal, that he might\r\nsave the life of his friend. Amidst the vehemence of each asserting\r\nhimself to be the offender, the Roman audience gave a thunder of\r\napplause, and by that means, as the author hints, approved in others\r\nwhat they would have done themselves on the like occasion. Methinks, a\r\npeople of so much virtue were deservedly placed at the head of mankind:\r\nBut alas! pleasures of this nature are not frequently to be met with on\r\nthe English stage.\r\n\r\nThe Athenians, at a time when they were the most polite, as well as the\r\nmost powerful, government in the world, made the care of the stage one\r\nof the chief parts of the administration: and I must confess, I am\r\nastonished at the spirit of virtue which appeared in that people upon\r\nsome expressions in a scene of a famous tragedy; an account of which we\r\nhave in one of Seneca's epistles.[32] A covetous person is represented\r\nspeaking the common sentiments of all who are possessed with that vice\r\nin the following soliloquy, which I have translated literally:\r\n\r\n     \"Let me be called a base man, so I am called a rich one. If a man is\r\n     rich, who asks if he is good? The question is, How much we have;\r\n     not from whence, or by what means, we have it. Every one has so\r\n     much merit as he has wealth. For my own part, let me be rich, O ye\r\n     gods! or let me die. The man dies happily, who dies increasing his\r\n     treasure. There is more pleasure in the possession of wealth, than\r\n     in that of parents, children, wife, or friends.\"\r\n\r\nThe audience were very much provoked by the first words of this speech;\r\nbut when the actor came to the close of it, they could bear no longer.\r\nIn short, the whole assembly rose up at once in the greatest fury, with\r\na design to pluck him off the stage, and brand the work itself with\r\ninfamy. In the midst of the tumult, the author came out from behind the\r\nscenes, begging the audience to be composed for a little while, and they\r\nshould see the tragical end which this wretch should come to\r\nimmediately. The promise of punishment appeased the people, who sat with\r\ngreat attention and pleasure to see an example made of so odious a\r\ncriminal. It is with shame and concern that I speak it; but I very much\r\nquestion, whether it is possible to make a speech so impious, as to\r\nraise such a laudable horror and indignation in a modern audience. It is\r\nvery natural for an author to make ostentation of his reading, as it is\r\nfor an old man to tell stories; for which reason I must beg the reader\r\nwill excuse me, if I for once indulge myself in both these inclinations.\r\nWe see the attention, judgment, and virtue of a whole audience, in the\r\nforegoing instances. If we would imitate the behaviour of a single\r\nspectator, let us reflect upon that of Socrates, in a particular which\r\ngives me as great an idea of that extraordinary man, as any circumstance\r\nof his life; or what is more, of his death. This venerable person often\r\nfrequented the theatre, which brought a great many thither, out of a\r\ndesire to see him; on which occasions it is recorded of him, that he\r\nsometimes stood to make himself the more conspicuous, and to satisfy the\r\ncuriosity of the beholders. He was one day present at the first\r\nrepresentation of a tragedy of Euripides, who was his intimate friend,\r\nand whom he is said to have assisted in several of his plays. In the\r\nmidst of the tragedy, which had met with very great success, there\r\nchanced to be a line that seemed to encourage vice and immorality.\r\n\r\nThis was no sooner spoken, but Socrates rose from his seat, and without\r\nany regard to his affection for his friend, or to the success of the\r\nplay, showed himself displeased at what was said, and walked out of the\r\nassembly. I question not but the reader will be curious to know what the\r\nline was that gave this divine heathen so much offence. If my memory\r\nfails me not, it was in the part of Hippolitus, who when he is pressed\r\nby an oath, which he had taken to keep silence, returned for answer,\r\nthat he had taken the oath with his tongue, but not with his heart. Had\r\na person of a vicious character made such a speech, it might have been\r\nallowed as a proper representation of the baseness of his thoughts: but\r\nsuch an expression out of the mouth of the virtuous Hippolitus, was\r\ngiving a sanction to falsehood, and establishing perjury by a maxim.\r\n\r\nHaving got over all interruptions, I have set apart tomorrow for the\r\nclosing of my vision.[33]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: See No. 120. \"A person dressed for Isaac Bickerstaff did\r\nappear at the playhouse on this occasion\" (Addison's \"Works,\"\r\nBirmingham, ii. 246).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: \"De Amicitia,\" vii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: L.

I here joined myself to the\r\nmiddle-aged party of mankind, who marched behind the standard of\r\nAmbition. The great road lay in a direct line, and was terminated by the\r\nTemple of Virtue. It was planted on each side with laurels, which were\r\nintermixed with marble trophies, carved pillars, and statues of\r\nlawgivers, heroes, statesmen, philosophers, and poets. The persons who\r\ntravelled up this great path, were such whose thoughts were bent upon\r\ndoing eminent services to mankind, or promoting the good of their\r\ncountry. On each side of this great road were several paths, that were\r\nalso laid out in straight lines, and ran parallel with it. These were\r\nmost of them covered walks, and received into them men of retired\r\nvirtue, who proposed to themselves the same end of their journey, though\r\nthey chose to make it in shade and obscurity. The edifices at the\r\nextremity of the walk were so contrived, that we could not see the\r\nTemple of Honour by reason of the Temple of Virtue, which stood before\r\nit. At the gates of this temple we were met by the goddess of it, who\r\nconducted us into that of Honour, which was joined to the other edifice\r\nby a beautiful triumphal arch, and had no other entrance into it. When\r\nthe deity of the inner structure had received us, she presented us in a\r\nbody to a figure that was placed over the high altar, and was the emblem\r\nof eternity. She sat on a globe in the midst of a golden zodiac, holding\r\nthe figure of a sun in one hand, and a moon in the other. Her head was\r\nveiled, and her feet covered. Our hearts glowed within us as we stood\r\namidst the sphere of light which this image cast on every side of it.\r\n\r\nHaving seen all that happened to this band of adventurers, I repaired to\r\nanother pile of buildings that stood within view of the Temple of\r\nHonour, and was raised in imitation of it, upon the very same model; but\r\nat my approach to it, I found that the stones were laid together without\r\nmortar, and that the whole fabric stood upon so weak a foundation, that\r\nit shook with every wind that blew. This was called the Temple of\r\nVanity. The goddess of it sat in the midst of a great many tapers, that\r\nburned day and night, and made her appear much better than she would\r\nhave done in open daylight. Her whole art was to show herself more\r\nbeautiful and majestic than she really was. For which reason, she had\r\npainted her face, and wore a cluster of false jewels upon her breast:\r\nbut what I more particularly observed, was, the breadth of her\r\npetticoat, which was made altogether in the fashion of a modern\r\nfarthingale. This place was filled with hypocrites, pedants,\r\nfreethinkers, and prating politicians; with a rabble of those who have\r\nonly titles to make them great men. Female votaries crowded the temple,\r\nchoked up the avenues of it, and were more in number than the sand upon\r\nthe seashore. I made it my business in my return towards that part of\r\nthe wood from whence I first set out, to observe the walks which led to\r\nthis temple; for I met in it several who had begun their journey with\r\nthe band of virtuous persons, and travelled some time in their company:\r\nbut upon examination I found, that there were several paths which led\r\nout of the great road into the sides of the wood, and ran into so many\r\ncrooked turns and windings, that those who travelled through them often\r\nturned their backs upon the Temple of Virtue, then crossed the straight\r\nroad, and sometimes marched in it for a little space, till the crooked\r\npath which they were engaged in again led them into the wood. The\r\nseveral alleys of these wanderers had their particular ornaments: one of\r\nthem I could not but take notice of, in the walk of the mischievous\r\npretenders to politics, which had at every turn the figure of a person,\r\nwhom by the inscription I found to be Machiavel, pointing out the way\r\nwith an extended finger like a Mercury.\r\n\r\nI was now returned in the same manner as before, with a design to\r\nobserve carefully everything that passed in the region of Avarice, and\r\nthe occurrences in that assembly, which was made up of persons of my own\r\nage. This body of travellers had not gone far in the third great road,\r\nbefore it led them insensibly into a deep valley, in which they\r\njourneyed several days with great toil and uneasiness, and without the\r\nnecessary refreshments of food and sleep. The only relief they met with,\r\nwas in a river that ran through the bottom of the valley on a bed of\r\ngolden sand: they often drank of this stream, which had such a\r\nparticular quality in it, that though it refreshed them for a time, it\r\nrather inflamed than quenched their thirst. On each side of the river\r\nwas a range of hills full of precious ore; for where the rains had\r\nwashed off the earth, one might see in several parts of them long veins\r\nof gold, and rocks that looked like pure silver. We were told that the\r\ndeity of the place had forbade any of his votaries to dig into the\r\nbowels of these hills, or convert the treasures they contained to any\r\nuse, under pain of starving. At the end of the valley stood the Temple\r\nof Avarice, made after the manner of a fortification, and surrounded\r\nwith a thousand triple-headed dogs, that were placed there to keep off\r\nbeggars. At our approach they all fell a-barking, and would have very\r\nmuch terrified us, had not an old woman who had called herself by the\r\nforged name of Competency offered herself for our guide. She carried\r\nunder her garment a golden bow, which she no sooner held up in her hand,\r\nbut the dogs lay down, and the gates flew open for our reception. We\r\nwere led through a hundred iron doors, before we entered the temple. At\r\nthe upper end of it sat the god of Avarice, with a long filthy beard,\r\nand a meagre starved countenance, enclosed with heaps of ingots and\r\npyramids of money, but half naked and shivering with cold. On his right\r\nhand was a fiend called Rapine, and on his left a particular favourite\r\nto whom he had given the title of Parsimony. The first was his\r\ncollector, and the other his cashier.\r\n\r\nThere were several long tables placed on each side of the temple, with\r\nrespective officers attending behind them. Some of these I inquired\r\ninto. At the first table was kept the office of Corruption. Seeing a\r\nsolicitor extremely busy, and whispering everybody that passed by, I\r\nkept my eye upon him very attentively, and saw him often going up to a\r\nperson that had a pen in his hand, with a multiplication table and an\r\nalmanac before him, which as I afterwards heard, was all the learning he\r\nwas master of. The solicitor would often apply himself to his ear, and\r\nat the same time convey money into his hand, for which the other would\r\ngive him out a piece of paper or parchment, signed and sealed in form.\r\nThe name of this dexterous and successful solicitor was Bribery. At the\r\nnext table was the office of Extortion. Behind it sat a person in a\r\nbob-wig, counting over a great sum of money. He gave out little purses\r\nto several, who after a short tour brought him, in return, sacks full of\r\nthe same kind of coin. I saw at the same time a person called Fraud, who\r\nsat behind a counter with false scales, light weights, and scanty\r\nmeasures; by the skilful application of which instruments, she had got\r\ntogether an immense heap of wealth. It would be endless to name the\r\nseveral officers, or describe the votaries that attended in this temple.\r\nThere were many old men panting and breathless, reposing their heads on\r\nbags of money; nay many of them actually dying, whose very pangs and\r\nconvulsions, which rendered their purses useless to them, only made them\r\ngrasp them the faster. There were some tearing with one hand all things,\r\neven to the garments and flesh of many miserable persons who stood\r\nbefore them, and with the other hand, throwing away what they had\r\nseized, to harlots, flatterers, and panders, that stood behind them.\r\n\r\nOn a sudden the whole assembly fell a-trembling, and upon inquiry, I\r\nfound, that the great room we were in was haunted with a spectre, that\r\nmany times a day appeared to them, and terrified them to distraction.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of their terror and amazement the apparition entered, which\r\nI immediately knew to be Poverty. Whether it were by my acquaintance\r\nwith this phantom, which had rendered the sight of her more familiar to\r\nme, or however it was, she did not make so indigent or frightful a\r\nfigure in my eye, as the god of this loathsome temple. The miserable\r\nvotaries of this place, were, I found, of another mind. Every one\r\nfancied himself threatened by the apparition as she stalked about the\r\nroom, and began to lock their coffers, and tie their bags, with the\r\nutmost fear and trembling.\r\n\r\nI must confess, I look upon the passion which I saw in this unhappy\r\npeople to be of the same nature with those unaccountable antipathies\r\nwhich some persons are born with, or rather as a kind of frenzy, not\r\nunlike that which throws a man into terrors and agonies at the sight of\r\nso useful and innocent a thing as water. The whole assembly was\r\nsurprised, when, instead of paying my devotions to the deity whom they\r\nall adored, they saw me address myself to the phantom.\r\n\r\n     \"O Poverty!\" said I, \"my first petition to thee is, that thou\r\n     wouldst never appear to me hereafter; but if thou wilt not grant me\r\n     this, that thou wouldst not bear a form more terrible than that in\r\n     which thou appearest to me at present. Let not thy threats and\r\n     menaces betray me to anything that is ungrateful or unjust. Let me\r\n     not shut my ears to the cries of the needy. Let me not forget the\r\n     person that has deserved well of me. Let me not, for any fear of\r\n     thee, desert my friend, my principles, or my honour. If Wealth is\r\n     to visit me, and to come with her usual attendants, Vanity and\r\n     Avarice, do thou, O Poverty! hasten to my rescue; but bring along\r\n     with thee the two sisters, in whose company thou art always\r\n     cheerful, Liberty and Innocence.\"\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of this vision must be deferred to another opportunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: See No. 120.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 124.

I think\r\nthere is a kind of homage due to fortune (if I may call it so), and that\r\nI should be wanting to myself if I did not lay in my pretences to her\r\nfavour, and pay my compliments to her by recommending a ticket to her\r\ndisposal. For this reason, upon my return to my lodgings, I sold off a\r\ncouple of globes and a telescope,[36] which, with the cash I had by me,\r\nraised the sum that was requisite for that purpose. I find by my\r\ncalculations, that it is but a hundred and fifty thousand to one against\r\nmy being worth a thousand pounds per annum for thirty-two years;[37] and\r\nif any plum[38] in the City will lay me a hundred and fifty thousand\r\npounds to twenty shillings (which is an even bet), that I am not this\r\nfortunate man, I will take the wager, and shall look upon him as a man\r\nof singular courage and fair-dealing, having given orders to Mr. Morphew\r\nto subscribe such a policy in my behalf, if any person accepts of the\r\noffer. I must confess, I have had such private intimations from the\r\ntwinkling of a certain star in some of my astronomical observations,\r\nthat I should be unwilling to take fifty pounds a year for my chance,\r\nunless it were to oblige a particular friend. My chief business at\r\npresent is, to prepare my mind for this change of fortune: for as\r\nSeneca, who was a great moralist, and a much richer man than I shall be\r\nwith this addition to my present income, says, \"_Munera ista Fortunæ\r\nputatis? Insidiæ sunt._\"[39] \"What we look upon as gifts and presents of\r\nFortune, are traps and snares which she lays for the unwary.\" I am\r\narming myself against her favours with all my philosophy; and that I may\r\nnot lose myself in such a redundance of unnecessary and superfluous\r\nwealth, I have determined to settle an annual pension out of it upon a\r\nfamily of Palatines, and by that means give these unhappy strangers a\r\ntaste of British property. At the same time, as I have an excellent\r\nservant-maid, whose diligence in attending me has increased in\r\nproportion to my infirmities, I shall settle upon her the revenue\r\narising out of the ten pounds, and amounting to fourteen shillings per\r\nannum, with which she may retire into Wales, where she was born a\r\ngentlewoman, and pass the remaining part of her days in a condition\r\nsuitable to her birth and quality. It was impossible for me to make an\r\ninspection into my own fortune on this occasion, without seeing at the\r\nsame time the fate of others who are embarked in the same adventure. And\r\nindeed it was a great pleasure to me to observe, that the war, which\r\ngenerally impoverishes those who furnish out the expense of it, will by\r\nthis means give estates to some, without making others the poorer for\r\nit. I have lately seen several in liveries, who will give as good of\r\ntheir own very suddenly; and took a particular satisfaction in the sight\r\nof a young country wench, whom I this morning passed by as she was\r\nwhirling her mop,[40] with her petticoats tucked up very agreeably, who,\r\nif there is any truth in my art, is within ten[41] months of being the\r\nhandsomest great fortune in town. I must confess, I was so struck with\r\nthe foresight of what she is to be, that I treated her accordingly, and\r\nsaid to her, \"Pray, young lady, permit me to pass by.\" I would for this\r\nreason advise all masters and mistresses to carry it with great\r\nmoderation and condescension towards their servants till next\r\nMichaelmas, lest the superiority at that time should be inverted. I must\r\nlikewise admonish all my brethren and fellow adventurers, to fill their\r\nminds with proper arguments for their support and consolation in case of\r\nill-success. It so happens in this particular, that though the gainers\r\nwill have reason to rejoice, the losers will have no reason to complain.\r\nI remember, the day after the thousand pound prize was drawn in the\r\npenny lottery,[42] I went to visit a splenetic acquaintance of mine, who\r\nwas under much dejection, and seemed to me to have suffered some great\r\ndisappointment. Upon inquiry, I found he had put twopence for himself\r\nand his son into the lottery and that neither of them had drawn the\r\nthousand pound. Hereupon this unlucky person took occasion to enumerate\r\nthe misfortunes of his life, and concluded with telling me, that he\r\nnever was successful in any of his undertakings. I was forced to comfort\r\nhim with the common reflection upon such occasions, that men of the\r\ngreatest merit are not always men of the greatest success, and that\r\npersons of his character must not expect to be as happy as fools. I\r\nshall proceed in the like manner with my rivals and competitors for the\r\nthousand pounds a year which we are now in pursuit of; and that I may\r\ngive general content to the whole body of candidates, I shall allow all\r\nthat draw prizes to be fortunate, and all that miss them to be wise.\r\n\r\nI must not here omit to acknowledge, that I have received several\r\nletters upon this subject, but find one common error running through\r\nthem all, which is, that the writers of them believe their fate in these\r\ncases depends upon the astrologer, and not upon the stars, as in the\r\nfollowing letter from one, who, I fear, flatters himself with hopes of\r\nsuccess, which are altogether groundless, since he does not seem to me\r\nso great a fool as he takes himself to be:\r\n\r\n     \"SIR,\r\n\r\n     \"Coming to town, and finding my friend Mr. Partridge dead and\r\n     buried, and you the only conjurer in repute, I am under a necessity\r\n     of applying myself to you for a favour, which nevertheless I\r\n     confess it would better become a friend to ask, than one who is, as\r\n     I am altogether, a stranger to you; but poverty, you know, is\r\n     impudent; and as that gives me the occasion, so that alone could\r\n     give me the confidence to be thus importunate.\r\n\r\n     \"I am, sir, very poor, and very desirous to be otherwise: I have\r\n     got ten pounds, which I design to venture in the lottery now on\r\n     foot. What I desire of you is, that by your art, you will choose\r\n     such a ticket for me as shall arise a benefit sufficient to\r\n     maintain me. I must beg leave to inform you, that I am good for\r\n     nothing, and must therefore insist upon a larger lot than would\r\n     satisfy those who are capable by their own abilities of adding\r\n     something to what you should assign them; whereas I must expect an\r\n     absolute, independent maintenance, because, as I said, I can do\r\n     nothing. 'Tis possible, after this free confession of mine, you may\r\n     think I don't deserve to be rich; but I hope you'll likewise\r\n     observe, I can ill afford to be poor. My own opinion is, I am well\r\n     qualified for an estate, and have a good title to luck in a\r\n     lottery; but I resign myself wholly to your mercy, not without\r\n     hopes that you will consider, the less I deserve, the greater the\r\n     generosity in you. If you reject me, I have agreed with an\r\n     acquaintance of mine to bury me for my ten pounds. I once more\r\n     recommend myself to your favour, and bid you adieu.\"\r\n\r\nI cannot forbear publishing another letter which I have received,\r\nbecause it redounds to my own credit, as well as to that of a very\r\nhonest footman:\r\n\r\n     \"MR. BICKERSTAFF, _January 23, 1709/10._\r\n\r\n     \"I am bound in justice to acquaint you, that I put an\r\n     advertisement[43] into your last paper about a watch which was\r\n     lost, and was brought to me on the very day your paper came out by\r\n     a footman, who told me, that he would [not] have brought it, if he\r\n     had not read your discourse of that day against avarice;[44] but\r\n     that since he had read it, he scorned to take a reward for doing\r\n     what in justice he ought to do.

It was a maxim of this sect, that all those\r\nwho do not live up to the principles of reason and virtue, are madmen.\r\nEvery one, who governs himself by these rules, is allowed the title of\r\nwise, and reputed to be in his senses; and every one in proportion, as\r\nhe deviates from them, is pronounced frantic and distracted. Cicero\r\nhaving chosen this maxim for his theme, takes occasion to argue from it\r\nvery agreeably with Clodius, his implacable adversary, who had procured\r\nhis banishment. \"A city,\" says he, \"is an assembly distinguished into\r\nbodies of men, who are in possession of their respective rights and\r\nprivileges, cast under proper subordinations, and in all its parts\r\nobedient to the rules of law and equity.\" He then represents the\r\ngovernment from whence he was banished, at a time when the consul,\r\nsenate, and laws, had lost their authority, as a commonwealth of\r\nlunatics. For this reason, he regards his expulsion from Rome, as a man\r\nwould being turned out of Bedlam, if the inhabitants of it should drive\r\nhim out of their walls as a person unfit for their community.[45] We are\r\ntherefore to look upon every man's brain to be touched, however he may\r\nappear in the general conduct of his life, if he has an unjustifiable\r\nsingularity in any part of his conversation or behaviour: or if he\r\nswerves from right reason, however common his kind of madness may be, we\r\nshall not excuse him for its being epidemical, it being our present\r\ndesign to clap up all such as have the marks of madness upon them, who\r\nare now permitted to go about the streets, for no other reason, but\r\nbecause they do no mischief in their fits. Abundance of imaginary great\r\nmen are put in straw to bring them to a right sense of themselves: and\r\nis it not altogether as reasonable, that an insignificant man, who has\r\nan immoderate opinion of his merits, and a quite different notion of his\r\nown abilities from what the rest of the world entertain, should have the\r\nsame care taken of him, as a beggar who fancies himself a duke or a\r\nprince? Or, why should a man, who starves in the midst of plenty, be\r\ntrusted with himself, more than he who fancies he is an emperor in the\r\nmidst of poverty? I have several women of quality in my thoughts, who\r\nset so exorbitant a value upon themselves, that I have often most\r\nheartily pitied them, and wished them, for their recovery, under the\r\nsame discipline with the pewterer's wife. I find by several hints in\r\nancient authors, that when the Romans were in the height of power and\r\nluxury, they assigned out of their vast dominions, an island called\r\nAnticyra, as an habitation for madmen. This was the Bedlam of the Roman\r\nEmpire, whither all persons who had left their wits used to resort from\r\nall parts of the world in quest of them. Several of the Roman emperors\r\nwere advised to repair to this island; but most of them, instead of\r\nlistening to such sober counsels, gave way to their distraction, till\r\nthe people knocked them in the head as despairing of their cure. In\r\nshort, it was as usual for men of distempered brains to take a voyage to\r\nAnticyra[46] in those days, as it is in ours for persons who have a\r\ndisorder in their lungs to go to Montpellier.\r\n\r\nThe prodigious crops of hellebore[47] with which this whole island\r\nabounded, did not only furnish them with incomparable tea, snuff, and\r\nHungary water,[48] but impregnated the air of the country with such\r\nsober and salutiferous streams, as very much comforted the heads, and\r\nrefreshed the senses, of all that breathed in it. A discarded statesman,\r\nthat at his first landing appeared stark staring mad, would become calm\r\nin a week's time; and upon his return home, live easy and satisfied in\r\nhis retirement. A moping lover would grow a pleasant fellow by that time\r\nhe had ridden thrice about the island; and a hair-brained rake, after a\r\nshort stay in the country, go home again a composed, grave, worthy\r\ngentleman.\r\n\r\nI have premised these particulars before I enter on the main design of\r\nthis paper, because I would not be thought altogether notional[49] in\r\nwhat I have to say, and pass only for a projector in morality. I could\r\nquote Horace, and Seneca, and some other ancient writers of good repute,\r\nupon the same occasion, and make out by their testimony, that our\r\nstreets are filled with distracted persons; that our shops and taverns,\r\nprivate and public houses, swarm with them; and that it is very hard to\r\nmake up a tolerable assembly without a majority of them. But what I have\r\nalready said, is, I hope, sufficient to justify the ensuing project,\r\nwhich I shall therefore give some account of without any further\r\npreface.\r\n\r\n     1. It is humbly proposed, that a proper receptacle or habitation be\r\n     forthwith erected for all such persons as, upon due trial and\r\n     examination, shall appear to be out of their wits.\r\n\r\n     2. That to serve the present exigency, the College in\r\n     Moorfields[50] be very much extended at both ends; and that it be\r\n     converted into a square, by adding three other sides to it.\r\n\r\n     3. That nobody be admitted into these three additional sides, but\r\n     such whose frenzy can lay no claim to an apartment in that row of\r\n     building which is already erected.\r\n\r\n     4. That the architect, physician, apothecary, surgeon, keepers,\r\n     nurses, and porters, be all and each of them cracked, provided that\r\n     their frenzy does not lie in the profession or employment to which\r\n     they shall severally and respectively be assigned.\r\n\r\n     N.B. It is thought fit to give the foregoing notice, that none may\r\n     present himself here for any post of honour or profit who is not\r\n     duly qualified.\r\n\r\n     5. That over all the gates of the additional buildings, there be\r\n     figures placed in the same manner as over the entrance of the\r\n     edifice already erected;[51] provided, they represent such\r\n     distractions only as are proper for those additional buildings; as,\r\n     of an envious man gnawing his own flesh, a gamester pulling himself\r\n     by the ears, and knocking his head against a marble pillar, a\r\n     covetous man warming himself over a heap of gold, a coward flying\r\n     from his own shadow, and the like.\r\n\r\nHaving laid down this general scheme of my design, I do hereby invite\r\nall persons who are willing to encourage so public-spirited a project,\r\nto bring in their contributions as soon as possible, and to apprehend\r\nforthwith any politician whom they shall catch raving in a coffee-house,\r\nor any freethinker whom they shall find publishing his deliriums, or any\r\nother person who shall give the like manifest signs of a crazed\r\nimagination; and I do at the same time give this public notice to all\r\nthe madmen about this great city, that they may return to their senses\r\nwith all imaginable expedition, lest if they should come into my hands,\r\nI should put them into a regimen which they would not like; for if I\r\nfind any one of them persist in his frantic behaviour, I will make him\r\nin a month's time as famous as ever Oliver's porter[52] was.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 45: Cicero, Tusc.

D'URFEY.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, January 27._\r\n\r\nThere is no sort of company so agreeable as that of women who have good\r\nsense without affectation, and can converse with men without any private\r\ndesign of imposing chains and fetters. Belvidera, whom I visited this\r\nevening, is one of these. There is an invincible prejudice in favour of\r\nall she says, from her being a beautiful woman, because she does not\r\nconsider herself as such when she talks to you. This amiable temper\r\ngives a certain tincture to all her discourse, and made it very\r\nagreeable to me, till we were interrupted by Lydia, a creature who has\r\nall the charms that can adorn a woman. Her attractions would indeed be\r\nirresistible, but that she thinks them so, and is always employing them\r\nin stratagems and conquests. When I turned my eye upon her as she sat\r\ndown, I saw she was a person of that character, which, for the further\r\ninformation of my country correspondents, I had long wanted an\r\nopportunity of explaining. Lydia is a finished coquette, which is a sect\r\namong women of all others the most mischievous, and makes the greatest\r\nhavoc and disorder in society. I went on in the discourse I was in with\r\nBelvidera, without showing that I had observed anything extraordinary in\r\nLydia: upon which, I immediately saw her look me over as some very\r\nill-bred fellow; and casting a scornful glance on my dress, gave a shrug\r\nat Belvidera. But as much as she despised me, she wanted my admiration,\r\nand made twenty offers to bring my eyes her way: but I reduced her to a\r\nrestlessness in her seat, an impertinent playing of her fan, and many\r\nother motions and gestures, before I took the least notice of her. At\r\nlast I looked at her with a kind of surprise, as if she had before been\r\nunobserved by reason of an ill light where she sat. It is not to be\r\nexpressed what a sudden joy I saw rise in her countenance, even at the\r\napprobation of such a very old fellow: but she did not long enjoy her\r\ntriumph without a rival; for there immediately entered Castabella, a\r\nlady of a quite contrary character, that is to say, as eminent a prude\r\nas Lydia is a coquette. Belvidera gave me a glance, which methought\r\nintimated, that they were both curiosities in their kind, and worth\r\nremarking. As soon as we were again seated, I stole looks at each lady,\r\nas if I was comparing their perfections. Belvidera observed it, and\r\nbegan to lead me into a discourse of them both to their faces, which is\r\nto be done easily enough; for one woman is generally so intent upon the\r\nfaults of another, that she has not reflection enough to observe when\r\nher own are represented. \"I have taken notice, Mr. Bickerstaff,\" said\r\nBelvidera, \"that you have in some parts of your writings drawn\r\ncharacters of our sex, in which you have not, to my apprehension, been\r\nclear enough and distinct, particularly in those of a prude and a\r\ncoquette.\" Upon the mention of this, Lydia was roused with the\r\nexpectation of seeing Castabella's picture, and Castabella with the\r\nhopes of that of Lydia. \"Madam,\" said I to Belvidera, \"when we consider\r\nnature, we shall often find very contrary effects flow from the same\r\ncause. The prude and coquette (as different as they appear in their\r\nbehaviour) are in reality the same kind of women: the motive of action\r\nin both is the affectation of pleasing men. They are sisters of the same\r\nblood and constitution, only one chooses a grave, the other a light,\r\ndress. The prude appears more virtuous, the coquette more vicious, than\r\nshe really is. The distant behaviour of the prude tends to the same\r\npurpose as the advances of the coquette; and you have as little reason\r\nto fall into despair from the severity of the one, as to conceive hope\r\nfrom the familiarity of the latter. What leads you into a clear sense of\r\ntheir character is, that you may observe each of them has the\r\ndistinction of sex in all her thoughts, words and actions. You can never\r\nmention any assembly you were lately in, but one asks you with a rigid,\r\nthe other with a sprightly air, 'Pray, what men were there?' As for\r\nprudes, it must be confessed, that there are several of them, who, like\r\nhypocrites, by long practice of a false part, become sincere; or at\r\nleast delude themselves into a belief that they are so.\"\r\n\r\nFor the benefit of this society of ladies, I shall propose one rule to\r\nthem as a test of their virtue. I find in a very celebrated modern\r\nauthor, that the great foundress of the Pietists, Madame de\r\nBourignon,[53] who was no less famous for the sanctity of her life than\r\nfor the singularity of some of her opinions, was used to boast, that she\r\nhad not only the spirit of continency in herself, but that she had also\r\nthe power of communicating it to all who beheld her. This the scoffers\r\nof those days called the Gift of Infrigidation, and took occasion from\r\nit to rally her face, rather than admire her virtue. I would therefore\r\nadvise the prude, who has a mind to know the integrity of her own heart,\r\nto lay her hand seriously upon it, and to examine herself, whether she\r\ncould sincerely rejoice in such a gift of conveying chaste thoughts to\r\nall her male beholders. If she has any aversion to the power of\r\ninspiring so great a virtue, whatever notion she may have of her\r\nperfection, she deceives her own heart, and is still in the state of\r\nprudery. Some perhaps will look upon the boast of Madame de Bourignon as\r\nthe utmost ostentation of a prude.\r\n\r\nIf you would see the humour of a coquette pushed to the last excess, you\r\nmay find an instance of it in the following story, which I will set down\r\nat length, because it pleased me when I read it, though I cannot\r\nrecollect in what author.\r\n\r\nA young coquette widow in France having been followed by a Gascon of\r\nquality, who had boasted among his companions of some favours which he\r\nhad never received, to be revenged of him, sent for him one evening, and\r\ntold him, it was in his power to do her a very particular service. The\r\nGascon, with much profession of his readiness to obey her commands,\r\nbegged to hear in what manner she designed to employ him. \"You know,\"\r\nsaid the widow, \"my friend Belinda, and must often have heard of the\r\njealousy of that impotent wretch her husband. Now it is absolutely\r\nnecessary, for the carrying on a certain affair, that his wife and I\r\nshould be together a whole night. What I have to ask of you, is, to\r\ndress yourself in her night-clothes, and lie by him a whole night in her\r\nplace, that he may not miss her while she is with me.\" The Gascon\r\n(though of a very lively and undertaking complexion) began to startle at\r\nthe proposal. \"Nay,\" says the widow, \"if you have not the courage to go\r\nthrough what I ask of you, I must employ somebody else that will.\"\r\n\"Madam,\" says the Gascon, \"I'll kill him for you if you please; but for\r\nlying with him!--How is it possible to do it without being discovered?\"\r\n\"If you do not discover yourself,\" says the widow, \"you will lie safe\r\nenough, for he is past all curiosity. He comes in at night while she is\r\nasleep, and goes out in the morning before she awakes, and is in pain\r\nfor nothing, so he knows she is there.\" \"Madam,\" replied the Gascon,\r\n\"how can you reward me for passing a night with this old fellow?\" The\r\nwidow answered with a laugh, \"Perhaps by admitting you to pass a night\r\nwith one you think more agreeable.\" He took the hint, put on his\r\nnight-clothes, and had not been a-bed above an hour before he heard a\r\nknocking at the door, and the treading of one who approached the other\r\nside of the bed, and who he did not question was the good man of the\r\nhouse. I do not know, whether the story would be better by telling you\r\nin this place, or at the end of it, that the person who went to bed to\r\nhim was our young coquette widow. The Gascon was in a terrible fright\r\nevery time she moved in the bed, or turned towards him, and did not fail\r\nto shrink from her till he had conveyed himself to the very ridge of the\r\nbed. I will not dwell upon the perplexity he was in the whole night,\r\nwhich was augmented, when he observed that it was now broad day, and\r\nthat the husband did not yet offer to get up and go about his business.\r\nAll that the Gascon had for it, was to keep his face turned from him,\r\nand to feign himself asleep, when, to his utter confusion, the widow at\r\nlast puts out her arm, and pulls the bell at her bed's head. In came her\r\nfriend, and two or three companions, to whom the Gascon had boasted of\r\nher favours. The widow jumped into a wrapping-gown, and joined with the\r\nrest in laughing at this man of intrigue.[54]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 53: Bayle, in his life of this devotee, 1697, says that\r\nAntoinette Bourignon was born at Lisle in 1616, so deformed, that it was\r\ndebated for some days in the family, whether it was not proper to stifle\r\nher as a monster. Her deformity diminishing, they laid aside the\r\nthought. Although she was of a morose and peevish temper, and embroiled\r\nin troubles most part of her life, she seemed to be but forty years of\r\nage when she was above sixty; never made use of spectacles, and died at\r\nFraneker, in the province of Frise, in 1680. From her childhood to her\r\nold age she had an extraordinary turn of mind. She published a multitude\r\nof books, filled with singular doctrines, such as might be expected from\r\na person who roundly asserted, on the express declaration, she said, of\r\nGod Himself, \"That the examination of things by reason, was the most\r\naccursed of all heresies, formal atheism, a rejection of God, and the\r\nsubstitution of corrupt reason in his place.\" She pretended to\r\ninspiration, and boasted of extraordinary communications with God; but\r\nappears to have been exceedingly defective in the essential duties of\r\nhumility and charity. She was a woman of such ill conditions and odd\r\nbehaviour, that nobody could live with her; and she seriously\r\nmaintained, that anger was a real virtue. She contrived to accumulate\r\nmoney, but continued always uncharitable upon principle, alleging the\r\nerrors of her understanding in defence of the inhumanity of her\r\nconduct.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 54: \"_Advertisement._--Proposals for printing the Lucubrations\r\nof Isaac Bickerstaff, Esq., by subscriptions, are to be seen, and\r\nsubscriptions taken by Charles Lillie, a perfumer, at the corner of\r\nBeaufort Buildings, in the Strand, and John Morphew, near Stationers\r\nHall.\" See No. 80, note.

[STEELE.\r\n\r\nFrom _Saturday, Jan. 28_, to _Tuesday, Jan. 31, 1709-10_.\r\n\r\n    Nimirum insanus paucis videatur, eo quod\r\n    Maxima pars hominum morbo jactatur eodem.\r\n                        HOR., 2 Sat. iii. 120.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, January 30._\r\n\r\nThere is no affection of the mind so much blended in human nature, and\r\nwrought into our very constitution, as pride. It appears under a\r\nmultitude of disguises, and breaks out in ten thousand different\r\nsymptoms. Every one feels it in himself, and yet wonders to see it in\r\nhis neighbour. I must confess, I met with an instance of it the other\r\nday where I should very little have expected it. Who would believe the\r\nproud person I am going to speak of, is a cobbler upon Ludgate Hill?\r\nThis artist being naturally a lover of respect, and considering that his\r\ncircumstances are such that no man living will give it him, has\r\ncontrived the figure of a beau in wood, who stands before him in a\r\nbending posture, with his hat under his left arm, and his right hand\r\nextended in such a manner as to hold a thread, a piece of wax, or an\r\nawl, according to the particular service in which his master thinks fit\r\nto employ him. When I saw him, he held a candle in this obsequious\r\nposture. I was very well pleased with the cobbler's invention, that had\r\nso ingeniously contrived an inferior, and stood a little while\r\ncontemplating this inverted idolatry, wherein the image did homage to\r\nthe man. When we meet with such a fantastic vanity in one of this order,\r\nit is no wonder if we may trace it through all degrees above it, and\r\nparticularly through all the steps of greatness. We easily see the\r\nabsurdity of pride when it enters into the heart of a cobbler; though in\r\nreality it is altogether as ridiculous and unreasonable wherever it\r\ntakes possession of a human creature. There is no temptation to it from\r\nthe reflection upon our being in general, or upon any comparative\r\nperfection, whereby one man may excel another. The greater a man's\r\nknowledge is, the greater motive he may seem to have for pride; but in\r\nthe same proportion as the one rises, the other sinks, it being the\r\nchief office of wisdom to discover to us our weaknesses and\r\nimperfections.\r\n\r\nAs folly is the foundation of pride, the natural superstructure of it is\r\nmadness. If there was an occasion for the experiment, I would not\r\nquestion to make a proud man a lunatic in three weeks' time, provided I\r\nhad it in my power to ripen his frenzy with proper applications. It is\r\nan admirable reflection in Terence, where it is said of a parasite,\r\n\"_Hic homines ex stultis facit insanos!_\"[55] \"This fellow,\" says he,\r\n\"has an art of converting fools into madmen.\" When I was in France (the\r\nregion of complaisance and vanity), I have often observed, that a great\r\nman who has entered a levy of flatterers humble and temperate, has grown\r\nso insensibly heated by the court which was paid him on all sides, that\r\nhe has been quite distracted before he could get into his coach.\r\n\r\nIf we consult the collegiates of Moorfields, we shall find most of them\r\nare beholden to their pride for their introduction into that magnificent\r\npalace.[56] I had some years ago the curiosity to inquire into the\r\nparticular circumstances of these whimsical freeholders, and learned\r\nfrom their own mouths the condition and character of each of them.\r\nIndeed I found, that all I spoke to were persons of quality. There were\r\nat that time five duchesses, three earls, two heathen gods, an emperor,\r\nand a prophet. There were also a great number of such as were locked up\r\nfrom their estates, and others who concealed their titles. A\r\nleather-seller of Taunton whispered me in my ear, that he was the Duke\r\nof Monmouth; but begged me not to betray him. At a little distance from\r\nhim sat a tailor's wife, who asked me as I went by, if I had seen the\r\nsword-bearer? Upon which I presumed to ask her, who she was; and was\r\nanswered, \"My Lady Mayoress.\"\r\n\r\nI was very sensibly touched with compassion towards these miserable\r\npeople; and indeed, extremely mortified to see human nature capable of\r\nbeing thus disfigured. However, I reaped this benefit from it, that I\r\nwas resolved to guard myself against a passion which makes such havoc in\r\nthe brain, and produces so much disorder in the imagination. For this\r\nreason, I have endeavoured to keep down the secret swellings of\r\nresentment, and stifle the very first suggestions of self-esteem; to\r\nestablish my mind in tranquillity, and over-value nothing in my own, or\r\nin another's possession.\r\n\r\nFor the benefit of such whose heads are a little turned, though not to\r\nso great a degree as to qualify them for the place of which I have been\r\nnow speaking, I shall assign one of the sides of the college which I am\r\nerecting, for the cure of this dangerous distemper.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable of the persons whose disturbance arises from pride,\r\nand whom I shall use all possible diligence to cure, are such as are\r\nbidden in the appearance of quite contrary habits and dispositions.\r\nAmong such, I shall in the first place take care of one who is under the\r\nmost subtle species of pride that I have observed in my whole\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nThis patient is a person for whom I have a great respect, as being an\r\nold courtier, and a friend of mine in my youth. The man has but a bare\r\nsubsistence, just enough to pay his reckoning with us at the\r\nTrumpet:[57] but by having spent the beginning of his life in the\r\nhearing of great men and persons of power, he is always promising to do\r\ngood offices, to introduce every man he converses with into the world;\r\nwill desire one of ten times his substance to let him see him sometimes,\r\nand hints to him, that he does not forget him. He answers to matters of\r\nno consequence with great circumspection; but however, maintains a\r\ngeneral civility in his words and actions, and an insolent benevolence\r\nto all whom he has to do with: this he practises with a grave tone and\r\nair; and though I am his senior by twelve years, and richer by forty\r\npounds per annum, he had yesterday the impudence to commend me to my\r\nface, and tell me, he should be always ready to encourage me. In a-word,\r\nhe is a very insignificant fellow, but exceeding gracious. The best\r\nreturn I can make him for his favours, is, to carry him myself to\r\nBedlam, and see him well taken care of.[58]\r\n\r\nThe next person I shall provide for, is of a quite contrary character;\r\nthat has in him all the stiffness and insolence of quality, without a\r\ngrain of sense or good nature to make it either respected or beloved.\r\nHis pride has infected every muscle of his face; and yet, after all his\r\nendeavours to show mankind that he contemns them, he is only neglected\r\nby all that see him, as not of consequence enough to be hated.\r\n\r\nFor the cure of this particular sort of madness, it will be necessary to\r\nbreak through all forms with him, and familiarise[59] his carriage by\r\nthe use of a good cudgel. It may likewise be of great benefit to make\r\nhim jump over a stick half a dozen times every morning.\r\n\r\nA third whom I have in my eye is a young fellow, whose lunacy is such,\r\nthat he boasts of nothing but what he ought to be ashamed of. He is vain\r\nof being rotten, and talks publicly of having committed crimes, which he\r\nought to be hanged for by the laws of his country.\r\n\r\nThere are several others whose brains are hurt with pride, and whom I\r\nmay hereafter attempt to recover; but shall conclude my present list\r\nwith an old woman, who is just dropping into her grave, that talks of\r\nnothing but her birth. Though she has not a tooth in her head, she\r\nexpects to be valued for the blood in her veins, which she fancies is\r\nmuch better than that which glows in the cheeks of Belinda,[60] and sets\r\nhalf the town on fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 55: \"Eunuchus,\" II. ii. 23.

This is therefore to let you know, that I have conceived a\r\n     most extraordinary passion for you; and that for several days I\r\n     have been perpetually haunted with the vision of a person I have\r\n     never yet seen. To satisfy you that I am in my senses, and that I\r\n     do not mistake you for any one of higher rank, I assure you, that\r\n     in your daily employment, you appear to my imagination more\r\n     agreeable in a short scanty petticoat, than the finest woman of\r\n     quality in her spreading farthingale; and that the dexterous twirl\r\n     of your mop has more native charms than the studied airs of a\r\n     lady's fan. In a word, I am captivated with your menial\r\n     qualifications: the domestic virtues adorn you like attendant\r\n     Cupids; cleanliness and healthful industry wait on all your\r\n     motions; and dust and cobwebs fly your approach.\r\n\r\n     \"Now, to give you an honest account of myself, and that you may see\r\n     my designs are honourable, I am an esquire of an ancient family,\r\n     born to about fifteen hundred pounds a year, half of which I have\r\n     spent in discovering myself to be a fool, and with the rest am\r\n     resolved to retire with some plain honest partner, and study to be\r\n     wiser. I had my education in a laced coat, and a French dancing\r\n     school; and by my travel into foreign parts, have just as much\r\n     breeding to spare, as you may think you want, which I intend to\r\n     exchange as fast as I can for old English honesty and good sense. I\r\n     will not impose on you by a false recommendation of my person,\r\n     which (to show you my sincerity) is none of the handsomest, being\r\n     of a figure somewhat short; but what I want in length, I make out\r\n     in breadth. But in amends for that and all other defects, If you\r\n     can like me when you see me, I shall continue to you, whether I\r\n     find you fair, black or brown,\r\n\r\n                                        \"THE MOST CONSTANT OF LOVERS.\r\n     \"_January 27, 1709/10._\"\r\n\r\nThis letter seems to be written by a wag, and for that reason I am not\r\nmuch concerned for what reception Mopsa shall think fit to give it; but\r\nthe following certainly proceeds from a poor heart, that languishes\r\nunder the most deplorable misfortune that possibly can befall a woman. A\r\nman that is treacherously dealt with in love may have recourse to many\r\nconsolations. He may gracefully break through all opposition to his\r\nmistress, or explain with his rival; urge his own constancy, or\r\naggravate the falsehood by which it is repaid. But a woman that is\r\nill-treated has no refuge in her griefs but in silence and secrecy. The\r\nworld is so unjust, that a female heart which has been once touched is\r\nthought for ever blemished. The very grief in this case is looked upon\r\nas a reproach, and a complaint almost a breach of chastity. For these\r\nreasons, we see treachery and falsehood are become as it were male\r\nvices, and are seldom found, never acknowledged, in the other sex. This\r\nmay serve to introduce Statira's letter, which, without any turn or art,\r\nhas something so pathetical and moving in it, that I verily believe it\r\nto be true, and therefore heartily pity the injured creature that wrote\r\nit:\r\n\r\n                                        \"_To Isaac Bickerstaff, Esq._\r\n     \"SIR,\r\n\r\n     \"You seem in many of your writings to be a man of a very\r\n     compassionate temper, and well acquainted with the passion of love.\r\n     This encourages me to apply myself to you in my present distress,\r\n     which I believe you will look upon to be very great, and treat with\r\n     tenderness, notwithstanding it wholly arises from love, and that it\r\n     is a woman that makes this confession. I am now in the twenty-third\r\n     year of my age, and have for a great while entertained the\r\n     addresses of a man who I thought loved me more than life. I am sure\r\n     I did him; and must own to you, not without some confusion, that I\r\n     have thought on nothing else for these two long years, but the\r\n     happy life we should lead together, and the means I should use to\r\n     make myself still dearer to him. My fortune was indeed much beyond\r\n     his; and as I was always in the company of my relations, he was\r\n     forced to discover his inclinations, and declare himself to me by\r\n     stories of other persons, kind looks, and many ways which he knew\r\n     too well that I understood. Oh! Mr. Bickerstaff, it is impossible\r\n     to tell you, how industrious I have been to make him appear lovely\r\n     in my thoughts. I made it a point of conscience to think well of\r\n     him, and of no man else: but he has since had an estate fallen to\r\n     him, and makes love to another of a greater fortune than mine. I\r\n     could not believe the report of this at first; but about a\r\n     fortnight ago I was convinced of the truth of it by his own\r\n     behaviour. He came to give our family a formal visit, when, as\r\n     there were several in company, and many things talked of, the\r\n     discourse fell upon some unhappy woman who was in my own\r\n     circumstances. It was said by one in the room, that they could not\r\n     believe the story could be true, because they did not believe any\r\n     man could be so false. Upon which, I stole a look upon him with an\r\n     anguish not to be expressed. He saw my eyes full of tears; yet had\r\n     the cruelty to say, that he could see no falsehood in alterations\r\n     of this nature, where there had been no contracts or vows\r\n     interchanged.

Among others,\r\nI have a letter from a burgher of Amsterdam, who makes me his\r\ncompliments, and tells me, he has sent me several draughts of humorous\r\nand satirical pictures by the best hands of the Dutch nation. They are a\r\ntrading people, and in their very minds mechanics. They express their\r\nwit in manufacture, as we do in manuscript. He informs me, that a very\r\nwitty hand has lately represented the present posture of public affairs\r\nin a landscape, or rather sea-piece, wherein the potentates of the\r\nAlliance are figured as their interests correspond with, or affect each\r\nother, under the appearance of commanders of ships. These vessels carry\r\nthe colours of the respective nations concerned in the present war. The\r\nwhole design seems to tend to one point, which is, that several\r\nsquadrons of British and Dutch ships are battering a French man-of-war,\r\nin order to make her deliver up a long-boat with Spanish colours. My\r\ncorrespondent informs me, that a man must understand the compass\r\nperfectly well, to be able to comprehend the beauty and invention of\r\nthis piece, which is so skilfully drawn, that the particular views of\r\nevery prince in Europe are seen according as the ships lie to the main\r\nfigure in the picture, and as that figure may help or retard their\r\nsailing. It seems this curiosity is now on board a ship bound for\r\nEngland, and with other rarities made a present to me. As soon as it\r\narrives, I design to expose it to public view at my secretary Mr.\r\nLillie's, who shall have an explication of all the terms of art; and I\r\ndoubt not but it will give as good content as the moving picture in\r\nFleet Street.[64]\r\n\r\nBut above all the honours I have received from the learned world abroad,\r\nI am most delighted with the following epistle from Rome:\r\n\r\n     \"_Pasquin of Rome, to Isaac Bickerstaff of Great Britain, greeting._\r\n     \"SIR,\r\n\r\n     \"Your reputation has passed the Alps, and would have come to my\r\n     ears by this time, if I had any. In short, sir, you are looked upon\r\n     here as a Northern droll, and the greatest virtuoso among the\r\n     Tramontanes. Some indeed say, that Mr. Bickerstaff and Pasquin are\r\n     only names invented, to father compositions which the natural\r\n     parent does not care for owning. But however that is, all agree,\r\n     that there are several persons, who, if they durst attack you,\r\n     would endeavour to leave you no more limbs than I have. I need not\r\n     tell you that my adversaries have joined in a confederacy with Time\r\n     to demolish me, and that, if I were not a very great wit, I should\r\n     make the worst figure in Europe, being abridged of my legs, arms,\r\n     nose, and ears. If you think fit to accept of the correspondence of\r\n     so facetious a cripple, I shall from time to time send you an\r\n     account of what happens at Rome. You have only heard of it from\r\n     Latin and Greek authors; may, perhaps, have read no accounts from\r\n     hence, but of a triumph, ovation, or apotheosis, and will,\r\n     doubtless, be surprised to see the description of a procession,\r\n     jubilee, or canonisation. I shall however send you what the place\r\n     affords, in return to what I shall receive from you. If you will\r\n     acquaint me with your next promotion of general officers, I will\r\n     send you an account of our next advancement of saints. If you will\r\n     let me know who is reckoned the bravest warrior in Great Britain,\r\n     I'll tell you who is the best fiddler in Rome. If you will favour\r\n     me with an inventory of the riches that were brought into your\r\n     nation by Admiral Wager,[65] I will not fail giving you an account\r\n     of a pot of medals that has been lately dug up here, and are now\r\n     under the examination of our ministers of state.\r\n\r\n     \"There is one thing in which I desire you would be very particular.\r\n     What I mean is an exact list of all the religions in Great Britain,\r\n     as likewise the habits, which are said here to be the great points\r\n     of conscience in England, whether they are made of serge or\r\n     broadcloth, of silk or linen. I should be glad to see a model of\r\n     the most conscientious dress amongst you, and desire you would\r\n     send me a hat of each religion; as likewise, if it be not too much\r\n     trouble, a cravat. It would also be very acceptable here to receive\r\n     an account of those two religious orders which are lately sprung up\r\n     amongst you, the Whigs and the Tories, with the points of doctrine,\r\n     severities in discipline, penances, mortifications, and good works,\r\n     by which they differ one from another. It would be no less kind if\r\n     you would explain to us a word which they do not understand even at\r\n     our English monastery toasts, and let us know whether the ladies so\r\n     called are nuns or lay-sisters.\r\n\r\n     \"In return, I will send you the secret history of several\r\n     cardinals, which I have by me in manuscript, with gallantries,\r\n     amours, politics, and intrigues, by which they made their way to\r\n     the Holy Purple.\r\n\r\n     \"But when I propose a correspondence, I must not tell you what I\r\n     intend to advise you of hereafter, and neglect to give you what I\r\n     have at present. The Pope has been sick for this fortnight of a\r\n     violent toothache, which has very much raised the French faction,\r\n     and put the conclave into a great ferment. Every one of the\r\n     pretenders to the succession is grown twenty years older than he\r\n     was a fortnight ago. Each candidate tries who shall cough and stoop\r\n     most; for these are at present the great gifts that recommend to\r\n     the apostolical seat, which he stands the fairest for, who is\r\n     likely to resign it the soonest. I have known the time when it used\r\n     to rain louis-d'ors on such occasions; but whatever is the matter,\r\n     there are very few of them to be seen at present at Rome, insomuch\r\n     that it is thought a man might purchase infallibility at a very\r\n     reasonable rate. It is nevertheless hoped that his Holiness may\r\n     recover, and bury these his imaginary successors.\r\n\r\n     \"There has lately been found a human tooth in a catacomb, which has\r\n     engaged a couple of convents in a lawsuit; each of them pretending\r\n     that it belonged to the jawbone of a saint who was of their Order.\r\n     The colleges have sat upon it thrice, and I find there is a\r\n     disposition among them to take it out of the possession of both the\r\n     contending parties, by reason of a speech which was made by one of\r\n     the cardinals, who, by reason of its being found out of the company\r\n     of any other bones, asserted, that it might be one of the teeth\r\n     which was coughed out by Ælia, an old woman whose loss is recorded\r\n     in Martial.[66]\r\n\r\n     \"I have nothing remarkable to communicate to you of State affairs,\r\n     excepting only, that the Pope has lately received a horse from the\r\n     German ambassador, as an acknowledgment for the kingdom of Naples,\r\n     which is a fief of the Church. His Holiness refused this horse from\r\n     the Germans ever since the Duke of Anjou has been possessed of\r\n     Spain; but as they lately took care to accompany it with a body of\r\n     ten thousand more, they have at last overcome his Holiness's\r\n     modesty, and prevailed upon him to accept the present.

He was sent commodore to the West Indies in 1707, where he\r\nattacked the Spanish galleons, May 28, 1708, with three ships, though\r\nthey were fourteen in number drawn up in line of battle, and defeated\r\nthem. His services Queen Anne distinguished by sending him a flag as\r\nVice-admiral of the Blue, intended for him before this engagement, and\r\nby honouring him at his return with knighthood. His share of prize-money\r\namounted to 100,000_l._ But the riches he acquired, on this and other\r\noccasions, were regarded by him only as instruments of doing good;\r\naccordingly he gave fortunes to his relations, that he might see them\r\nhappy in his lifetime; and to persons in distress, his liberality was\r\nsuch, that whole families were supported, and their estates and fortunes\r\nsaved, by his generosity. He was promoted to be Rear-admiral of the Red,\r\nNovember 9, 1709; and in that year was returned for Portsmouth to\r\nParliament, where he continued to sit till his death. In April 1726, he\r\nwas sent up the Baltic as Vice-admiral of the Red, with a large fleet on\r\nan important expedition; and performed all that could be expected from\r\nthe wisdom and skill of an English admiral. He dined with the King of\r\nDenmark; had an audience of the King of Sweden; and exchanged many\r\ncivilities with Prince Menzikoff, then Prime Minister of Russia. He was\r\nappointed Comptroller of the Navy in February 1714; a Lord of the\r\nAdmiralty in March 1717; and, on the death of Lord Torrington in January\r\n1732-3, he was placed at the head of that Board, and appointed president\r\nof the corporation for relief of poor sea-officers' widows, and also\r\npresident of the corporation of the Trinity House. He was appointed one\r\nof the Lords Regent in 1741; Vice-admiral of England and Treasurer of\r\nthe Navy in 1742; and died May 24, 1743, aged 77. A prudent, temperate,\r\nwise, and honest man, he was easy of access to all, unaffected in his\r\nmanners, steady and resolute in his conduct, affable and cheerful in his\r\nbehaviour, and in time of action or imminent danger was never hurried or\r\ndiscomposed (Nichols).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 66: \"Epig.\" i. 20.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 67: See No. 130, Advertisement.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 130.

ADDISON.[68]\r\n\r\nFrom _Saturday, Feb. 4_, to _Tuesday, Feb. 7, 1709-10_.\r\n\r\n                          ----At me\r\n    Cum magnis vixisse invita fatebitur usque\r\n    Invidia.--HOR., 2 Sat. i. 75.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sheer Lane, February 6._\r\n\r\nI find some of the most polite Latin authors, who wrote at a time when\r\nRome was in its glory, speak with a certain noble vanity of the\r\nbrightness and splendour of the age in which they lived. Pliny often\r\ncompliments his Emperor Trajan upon this head; and when he would\r\nanimate him to anything great, or dissuade him from anything that was\r\nimproper, he insinuates, that it is befitting or unbecoming the\r\n_claritas et nitor sæculi_, that period of time which was made\r\nillustrious by his reign. When we cast our eyes back on the history of\r\nmankind, and trace them through their several successions to their first\r\noriginal, we sometimes see them breaking out in great and memorable\r\nactions, and towering up to the utmost heights of virtue and knowledge;\r\nwhen, perhaps, if we carry our observation to a little distance, we see\r\nthem sunk into sloth and ignorance, and altogether lost in darkness and\r\nobscurity. Sometimes the whole species is asleep for two or three\r\ngenerations, and then again awakens into action, flourishes in heroes,\r\nphilosophers, and poets, who do honour to human nature, and leave such\r\ntracts of glory behind them, as distinguish the years in which they\r\nacted their part from the ordinary course of time.\r\n\r\nMethinks a man cannot, without a secret satisfaction, consider the glory\r\nof the present age, which will shine as bright as any other in the\r\nhistory of mankind. It is still big with great events, and has already\r\nproduced changes and revolutions which will be as much admired by\r\nposterity, as any that have happened in the days of our fathers, or in\r\nthe old times before them. We have seen kingdoms divided and united,\r\nmonarchs erected and deposed, nations transferred from one sovereign to\r\nanother; conquerors raised to such a greatness as has given a terror to\r\nEurope, and thrown down by such a fall, as has moved their pity.\r\n\r\nBut it is still a more pleasing view to an Englishman, to see his own\r\ncountry give the chief influence to so illustrious an age, and stand in\r\nthe strongest point of light amidst the diffused glory that surrounds\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIf we begin with learned men, we may observe, to the honour of our\r\ncountry, that those who make the greatest figure in most arts and\r\nsciences, are universally allowed to be of the British nation; and what\r\nis more remarkable, that men of the greatest learning are among the men\r\nof the greatest quality.\r\n\r\nA nation may indeed abound with persons of such uncommon parts and\r\nworth, as may make them rather a misfortune than a blessing to the\r\npublic. Those who singly might have been of infinite advantage to the\r\nage they live in, may, by rising up together in the same crisis of time,\r\nand by interfering in their pursuits of honour, rather interrupt than\r\npromote the service of their country. Of this we have a famous instance\r\nin the Republic of Rome, when Cæsar, Pompey, Cato, Cicero, and Brutus,\r\nendeavoured to recommend themselves at the same time to the admiration\r\nof their contemporaries. Mankind was not able to provide for so many\r\nextraordinary persons at once, or find out posts suitable to their\r\nambition and abilities. For this reason, they were all as miserable in\r\ntheir deaths as they were famous in their lives, and occasioned, not\r\nonly the ruin of each other, but also that of the commonwealth.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore a particular happiness to a people, when the men of\r\nsuperior genius and character are so justly disposed in the high places\r\nof honour, that each of them moves in a sphere which is proper to him,\r\nand requires those particular qualities in which he excels.\r\n\r\nIf I see a general commanding the forces of his country, whose victories\r\nare not to be paralleled in story, and who is as famous for his\r\nnegotiations as his victories;[69] and at the same time see the\r\nmanagement of a nation's treasury in the hands of one who has always\r\ndistinguished himself by a generous contempt of his own private wealth,\r\nand an exact frugality of that which belongs to the public;[70] I\r\ncannot but think a people under such an Administration may promise\r\nthemselves conquest abroad, and plenty at home. If I were to wish for a\r\nproper person to preside over the public councils, it should certainly\r\nbe one as much admired for his universal knowledge of men and things, as\r\nfor his eloquence, courage and integrity, in the exerting of such\r\nextraordinary talents.[71]\r\n\r\nWho is not pleased to see a person in the highest station in the law,\r\nwho was the most eminent in his profession, and the most accomplished\r\norator at the Bar?[72] Or at the head of the fleet a commander, under\r\nwhose conduct the common enemy received such a blow as he has never been\r\nable to recover?[73]\r\n\r\nWere we to form to ourselves the idea of one whom we should think proper\r\nto govern a distant kingdom, consisting chiefly of those who differ from\r\nus in religion, and are influenced by foreign politics, would it not be\r\nsuch a one as had signalised himself by a uniform and unshaken zeal for\r\nthe Protestant interest, and by his dexterity in defeating the skill and\r\nartifice of its enemies?[74] In short, if we find a great man popular\r\nfor his honesty and humanity, as well as famed for his learning and\r\ngreat skill in all the languages of Europe, or a person eminent for\r\nthose qualifications which make men shine in public assemblies, or for\r\nthat steadiness, constancy, and good sense, which carry a man to the\r\ndesired point through all the opposition of tumult and prejudice, we\r\nhave the happiness to behold them all in posts suitable to their\r\ncharacters.\r\n\r\nSuch a constellation of great persons, if I may so speak, while they\r\nshine out in their own distinct capacities, reflect a lustre upon each\r\nother, but in a more particular manner on their Sovereign, who has\r\nplaced them in those proper situations, by which their virtues become so\r\nbeneficial to all her subjects. It is the anniversary of the birthday of\r\nthis glorious Queen which naturally led me into this field of\r\ncontemplation, and instead of joining in the public exultations that are\r\nmade on such occasions, to entertain my thoughts with the more serious\r\npleasure of ruminating upon the glories of her reign.\r\n\r\nWhile I behold her surrounded with triumphs, and adorned with all the\r\nprosperity and success which Heaven ever shed on a mortal, and still\r\nconsidering herself as such; though the person appears to me exceeding\r\ngreat that has these just honours paid to her, yet I must confess, she\r\nappears much greater in that she receives them with such a glorious\r\nhumility, and shows she has no further regard for them, than as they\r\narise from these great events which have made her subjects happy. For my\r\nown part, I must confess, when I see private virtues in so high a degree\r\nof perfection, I am not astonished at any extraordinary success that\r\nattends them, but look upon public triumphs as the natural consequences\r\nof religious retirements.\r\n\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT.\r\n\r\nFinding some persons have mistaken Pasquin who was mentioned in my last,\r\nfor one who has been pilloried at Rome; I must here advertise them, that\r\nit is only a maimed statue so called, on which the private scandal of\r\nthat city is generally pasted. Morforio is a person of the same quality,\r\nwho is usually made to answer whatever is published by the other: the\r\nwits of that place, like too many of our own country, taking pleasure in\r\nsetting innocent people together by the ears. The mentioning of this\r\nperson, who is a great wit, and a great cripple, put me in mind of Mr.\r\nEstcourt,[75] who is under the same circumstances. He was formerly my\r\napothecary, and being at present disabled by the gout and stone, I must\r\nrecommend him to the public on Thursday next, that admirable play of Ben\r\nJonson's, called, \"The Silent Woman,\" being appointed to be acted for\r\nhis benefit. It would be indecent for me to appear twice in a season at\r\nthese ludicrous diversions; but as I always give my man and my maid one\r\nday in the year, I shall allow them this, and am promised by Mr.\r\nEstcourt, my ingenious apothecary, that they shall have a place kept for\r\nthem in the first row of the middle gallery.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 68: Nichols suggests that this paper may be by Addison,\r\nbecause in No. 131 Addison has the following note: \"For the benefit of\r\nmy readers, I think myself obliged here to let them know that I always\r\nmake use of an old-fashioned e, which very little differs from an o.\r\nThis has been the reason that my printer sometimes mistakes the one for\r\nthe other; as in my last paper, I find, _those_ for _these_, _beheld_\r\nfor _behold_, Corvix for Cervix, and the like.\" The internal evidence\r\nsupports this view; but the paper is not included in Addison's Works.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 69: The Duke of Marlborough.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 70: Sidney, Lord Godolphin.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 71: Lord Somers.

They can squeeze bordeaux out of the sloe, and draw\r\nchampagne from an apple. Virgil in that remarkable prophecy,\r\n\r\n    _Incultisque rubens pendebit sentibus uva_,[76]\r\n\r\n    (_The ripening grape shall hang on every thorn_),\r\n\r\nseems to have hinted at this art which can turn a plantation of Northern\r\nhedges into a vineyard.

As a man never pleads better than where his own personal\r\ninterest is concerned, he exhibited to the court with great eloquence,\r\nthat this new corporation of druggists had inflamed the bills of\r\nmortality, and puzzled the College of Physicians with diseases, for\r\nwhich they neither knew a name nor cure. He accused some of giving all\r\ntheir customers colics and megrims; and mentioned one who had boasted,\r\nhe had a tun of claret by him, that in a fortnight's time should give\r\nthe gout to a dozen of the healthiest men in the city, provided that\r\ntheir constitutions were prepared for it by wealth and idleness. He then\r\nenlarged, with a great show of reason, upon the prejudice which these\r\nmixtures and compositions had done to the brains of the English nation;\r\nas is too visible (said he) from many late pamphlets, speeches and\r\nsermons, as well as from the ordinary conversations of the youth of this\r\nage. He then quoted an ingenious person, who would undertake to know by\r\na man's writings, the wine he most delighted in; and on that occasion\r\nnamed a certain satirist, whom he had discovered to be the author of a\r\nlampoon, by a manifest taste of the sloe, which showed itself in it by\r\nmuch roughness, and little spirit.\r\n\r\nIn the last place, he ascribed to the unnatural tumults and\r\nfermentations which these mixtures raise in our blood, the divisions,\r\nheat and animosities, that reign among us; and in particular, asserted\r\nmost of the modern enthusiasms and agitations to be nothing else but the\r\neffects of adulterated port.\r\n\r\nThe counsel for the brewers had a face so extremely inflamed and\r\nilluminated with carbuncles, that I did not wonder to see him an\r\nadvocate for these sophistications. His rhetoric was likewise such as I\r\nshould have expected from the common draught, which I found he often\r\ndrank to a great excess. Indeed, I was so surprised at his figure and\r\nparts, that I ordered him to give me a taste of his usual liquor; which\r\nI had no sooner drunk, but I found a pimple rising in my forehead; and\r\nfelt such a sensible decay in my understanding, that I would not proceed\r\nin the trial till the fume of it was entirely dissipated.\r\n\r\nThis notable advocate had little to say in the defence of his clients,\r\nbut that they were under a necessity of making claret if they would keep\r\nopen their doors, it being the nature of mankind to love everything that\r\nis prohibited. He further pretended to reason, that it might be as\r\nprofitable to the nation to make French wine as French hats; and\r\nconcluded with the great advantage that this had already brought to\r\npart of the kingdom. Upon which he informed the court, that the lands in\r\nHertfordshire were raised two years' purchase since the beginning of the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nWhen I had sent out my summons to these people, I gave at the same time\r\norders to each of them to bring the several ingredients he made use of\r\nin distinct phials, which they had done accordingly, and ranged them\r\ninto two rows on each side of the court. The workmen were drawn up in\r\nranks behind them. The merchant informed me, that in one row of phials\r\nwere the several colours they dealt in, and in the other the tastes. He\r\nthen showed me on the right hand one who went by the name of Tom\r\nTintoret, who (as he told me) was the greatest master in his colouring\r\nof any vintner in London.[77] To give me a proof of his art, he took a\r\nglass of fair water; and by the infusion of three drops out of one of\r\nhis phials, converted it into a most beautiful pale burgundy. Two more\r\nof the same kind heightened it into a perfect languedoc: from thence it\r\npassed into a florid hermitage: and after having gone through two or\r\nthree other changes, by the addition of a single drop, ended in a very\r\ndeep pontack.[78] This ingenious virtuoso seeing me very much surprised\r\nat his art, told me, that he had not an opportunity of showing it in\r\nperfection, having only made use of water for the groundwork of his\r\ncolouring: but that if I were to see an operation upon liquors of\r\nstronger bodies, the art would appear to a much greater advantage. He\r\nadded, that he doubted not that it would please my curiosity to see the\r\ncider of one apple take only a vermilion, when another, with a less\r\nquantity of the same infusion, would rise into a dark purple, according\r\nto the different texture of parts in the liquor. He informed me also,\r\nthat he could hit the different shades and degrees of red, as they\r\nappear in the pink and the rose, the clove and the carnation, as he had\r\nRhenish or Moselle, perry, or white port, to work in.\r\n\r\nI was so satisfied with the ingenuity of this virtuoso, that, after\r\nhaving advised him to quit so dishonest a profession, I promised him, in\r\nconsideration of his great genius, to recommend him as a partner to a\r\nfriend of mine, who has heaped up great riches, and is a scarlet dyer.\r\n\r\nThe artists on my other hand were ordered in the second place to make\r\nsome experiments of their skill before me: upon which the famous Harry\r\nSippet stepped out, and asked me what I would be pleased to drink. At\r\nthe same time he filled out three or four white liquors in a glass, and\r\ntold me, that it should be what I pleased to call for; adding very\r\nlearnedly, that the liquor before him was as the naked substance or\r\nfirst matter of his compound, to which he and his friend, who stood over\r\nagainst him, could give what accidents or form they pleased. Finding him\r\nso great a philosopher, I desired he would convey into it the qualities\r\nand essence of right bordeaux. \"Coming, coming, sir,\" said he, with the\r\nair of a drawer; and after having cast his eye on the several tastes and\r\nflavours that stood before him; he took up a little cruet that was\r\nfilled with a kind of inky juice, and pouring some of it out into the\r\nglass of white wine, presented it to me, and told me, this was the wine\r\nover which most of the business of the last term had been despatched. I\r\nmust confess, I looked upon that sooty drug which he held up in his\r\ncruet as the quintessence of English bordeaux, and therefore desired\r\nhim to give me a glass of it by itself, which he did with great\r\nunwillingness. My cat at that time sat by me upon the elbow of my chair;\r\nand as I did not care for making the experiment upon myself, I reached\r\nit to her to sip of it, which had like to have cost her her life; for\r\nnotwithstanding it flung her at first into freakish tricks, quite\r\ncontrary to her usual gravity, in less than a quarter of an hour she\r\nfell into convulsions; and had it not been a creature more tenacious of\r\nlife than any other, would certainly have died under the operation.\r\n\r\nI was so incensed by the tortures of my innocent domestic, and the\r\nunworthy dealings of these men, that I told them, if each of them had as\r\nmany lives as the injured creature before them, they deserved to forfeit\r\nthem for the pernicious arts which they used for their profit. I\r\ntherefore bid them look upon themselves as no better than as a kind of\r\nassassins and murderers within the law. However, since they had dealt so\r\nclearly with me, and laid before me their whole practice, I dismissed\r\nthem for that time; with a particular request, that they would not\r\npoison any of my friends and acquaintance, and take to some honest\r\nlivelihood without loss of time.\r\n\r\nFor my own part, I have resolved hereafter to be very careful in my\r\nliquors, and have agreed with a friend of mine in the army, upon their\r\nnext march, to secure me two hogsheads of the best stomach-wine in the\r\ncellars of Versailles, for the good of my Lucubrations, and the comfort\r\nof my old age.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 76: Eclog. iv. 29.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 77: See No. 138.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 78: A fashionable eating-house in Abchurch Lane, kept by one\r\nPontack, who was son of the President of Bordeaux, then owner, as Evelyn\r\ntells us, of the excellent vineyards of Pontaq and Haut Brion.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 132.

This I\r\nfind particularly necessary for me before I retire to rest, in order to\r\ndraw my slumbers upon me by degrees, and fall asleep insensibly. This is\r\nthe particular use I make of a set of heavy honest men, with whom I have\r\npassed many hours, with much indolence, though not with great pleasure.\r\nTheir conversation is a kind of preparative for sleep: it takes the mind\r\ndown from its abstractions, leads it into the familiar traces[79] of\r\nthought, and lulls it into that state of tranquillity, which is the\r\ncondition of a thinking man when he is but half awake. After this, my\r\nreader will not be surprised to hear the account which I am about to\r\ngive of a club of my own contemporaries, among whom I pass two or three\r\nhours every evening. This I look upon as taking my first nap before I go\r\nto bed. The truth of it is, I should think myself unjust to posterity,\r\nas well as to the society at the Trumpet,[80] of which I am a member,\r\ndid not I in some part of my writings give an account of the persons\r\namong whom I have passed almost a sixth part of my time for these last\r\nforty years. Our club consisted originally of fifteen; but partly by the\r\nseverity of the law in arbitrary times, and partly by the natural\r\neffects of old age, we are at present reduced to a third part of that\r\nnumber: in which however we have this consolation, that the best company\r\nis said to consist of five persons. I must confess, besides the\r\naforementioned benefit which I meet with in the conversation of this\r\nselect society, I am not the less pleased with the company, in that I\r\nfind myself the greatest wit among them, and am heard as their oracle in\r\nall points of learning and difficulty.\r\n\r\nSir Jeoffrey Notch, who is the oldest of the club, has been in\r\npossession of the right-hand chair time out of mind, and is the only man\r\namong us that has the liberty of stirring the fire. This our foreman is\r\na gentleman of an ancient family, that came to a great estate some years\r\nbefore he had discretion, and run it out in hounds, horses, and\r\ncock-fighting; for which reason he looks upon himself as an honest\r\nworthy gentleman who has had misfortunes in the world, and calls every\r\nthriving man a pitiful upstart.\r\n\r\nMajor Matchlock is the next senior, who served in the last civil wars,\r\nand has all the battles by heart. He does not think any action in Europe\r\nworth talking of since the fight of Marston Moor;[81] and every night\r\ntells us of his having been knocked off his horse at the rising of the\r\nLondon apprentices;[82] for which he is in great esteem amongst us.\r\n\r\nHonest old Dick Reptile is the third of our society: he is a\r\ngood-natured indolent man, who speaks little himself, but laughs at our\r\njokes, and brings his young nephew along with him, a youth of eighteen\r\nyears old, to show him good company, and give him a taste of the world.\r\nThis young fellow sits generally silent; but whenever he opens his\r\nmouth, or laughs at anything that passes, he is constantly told by his\r\nuncle, after a jocular manner, \"Ay, ay, Jack, you young men think us\r\nfools; but we old men know you are.\"[83]\r\n\r\nThe greatest wit of our company, next to myself, is a bencher of the\r\nneighbouring inn, who in his youth frequented the ordinaries about\r\nCharing Cross, and pretends to have been intimate with Jack Ogle.[84] He\r\nhas about ten distichs of \"Hudibras\" without book, and never leaves the\r\nclub till he has applied them all. If any modern wit be mentioned, or\r\nany town frolic spoken of, he shakes his head at the dulness of the\r\npresent age, and tells us a story of Jack Ogle.\r\n\r\nFor my own part, I am esteemed among them, because they see I am\r\nsomething respected by others, though at the same time I understand by\r\ntheir behaviour, that I am considered by them as a man of a great deal\r\nof learning, but no knowledge of the world; insomuch that the Major\r\nsometimes, in the height of his military pride, calls me the\r\nphilosopher: and Sir Jeoffrey no longer ago than last night, upon a\r\ndispute what day of the month it was then in Holland, pulled his pipe\r\nout of his mouth, and cried, \"What does the scholar say to it?\"\r\n\r\nOur club meets precisely at six o'clock in the evening; but I did not\r\ncome last night till half an hour after seven, by which means I escaped\r\nthe battle of Naseby, which the Major usually begins at about\r\nthree-quarters after six; I found also, that my good friend, the\r\nbencher, had already spent three of his distichs, and only waiting an\r\nopportunity to hear a sermon spoken of, that he might introduce the\r\ncouplet where \"a stick\" rhymes to \"ecclesiastic.\"[85] At my entrance\r\ninto the room, they were naming a red petticoat and a cloak, by which I\r\nfound that the bencher had been diverting them with a story of Jack\r\nOgle.\r\n\r\nI had no sooner taken my seat, but Sir Jeoffrey, to show his goodwill\r\ntowards me, gave me a pipe of his own tobacco, and stirred up the fire.\r\nI look upon it as a point of morality, to be obliged by those who\r\nendeavour to oblige me; and therefore in requital for his kindness, and\r\nto set the conversation a-going, I took the best occasion I could, to\r\nput him upon telling us the story of old Gantlett, which he always does\r\nwith very particular concern. He traced up his descent on both sides for\r\nseveral generations, describing his diet and manner of life, with his\r\nseveral battles, and particularly that in which he fell. This Gantlett\r\nwas a game-cock, upon whose head the knight in his youth had won five\r\nhundred pounds, and lost two thousand. This naturally set the major upon\r\nthe account of Edge Hill fight, and ended in a duel of Jack Ogle's.\r\n\r\nOld Reptile was extremely attentive to all that was said, though it was\r\nthe same he had heard every night for these twenty years, and upon all\r\noccasions, winked upon his nephew to mind what passed.\r\n\r\nThis may suffice to give the world a taste of our innocent conversation,\r\nwhich we spun out till about ten of the clock, when my maid[86] came\r\nwith a lantern to light me home. I could not but reflect with myself as\r\nI was going out upon the talkative humour of old men, and the little\r\nfigure which that part of life makes in one who cannot employ this\r\nnatural propensity in discourses which would make him venerable. I must\r\nown, it makes me very melancholy in company, when I hear a young man\r\nbegin a story; and have often observed, that one of a quarter of an hour\r\nlong in a man of five and twenty, gathers circumstances every time he\r\ntells it, till it grows into a long Canterbury tale of two hours by that\r\ntime he is three-score.\r\n\r\nThe only way of avoiding such a trifling and frivolous old age, is, to\r\nlay up in our way to it such stores of knowledge and observation as may\r\nmake us useful and agreeable in our declining years. The mind of man in\r\na long life will become a magazine of wisdom or folly, and will\r\nconsequently discharge itself in something impertinent or improving. For\r\nwhich reason, as there is nothing more ridiculous than an old trifling\r\nstory-teller, so there is nothing more venerable than one who has turned\r\nhis experience to the entertainment and advantage of mankind.\r\n\r\nIn short, we who are in the last stage of life, and are apt to indulge\r\nourselves in talk, ought to consider, if what we speak be worth being\r\nheard, and endeavour to make our discourse like that of Nestor, which\r\nHomer compares to the flowing of honey for its sweetness.[87]\r\n\r\nI am afraid I shall be thought guilty of this excess I am speaking of,\r\nwhen I cannot conclude without observing, that Milton certainly thought\r\nof this passage in Homer, when in his description of an eloquent spirit,\r\nhe says, \"His tongue dropped manna.\"[88]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 79: Paths.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 80: The Trumpet stood about half-way up Shire Lane, between\r\nTemple Bar and Carey Street, at the widest and best part of the lane,\r\nand remained almost entirely in its original state until demolished to\r\nmake way for the new Law Courts. It had the old sign of the Trumpet to\r\nthe last, as it is figured in Limbard's \"Mirror,\" in a picture where it\r\nis placed side by side with a view of the house in Fulwood's Rents where\r\npapers for the _Spectator_ were taken in.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 81: July 2, 1644.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 82: In July 1647 the London apprentices presented a petition,\r\nand forced their way into the House of Commons.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 83: This retort, in almost identical words, occurs in Swift's\r\n\"Genteel Conversation\" (1739), and in Defoe's \"Life of Duncan Campbell\"\r\n(1720).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 84: Jack Ogle, said to have been descended from a decent\r\nfamily in Devonshire, was a man of some genius and great extravagance,\r\nbut rather artful than witty. Ogle had an only sister, more beautiful,\r\nit is said, than was necessary to arrive, as she did, at the honour of\r\nbeing a mistress to the Duke of York. This sister Ogle laid under very\r\nfrequent contributions to supply his wants and support his extravagance.\r\nIt is said that, by the interest of her royal keeper, Ogle was placed,\r\nas a private gentleman, in the first troop of foot guards, at that time\r\nunder the command of the Duke of Monmouth. To this era of Ogle's life\r\nthe story of the red petticoat refers. He had pawned his trooper's\r\ncloak, and to save appearances at a review, had borrowed his landlady's\r\nred petticoat, which he carried rolled up _en croupe_ behind him. The\r\nDuke of Monmouth \"smoked\" it, and willing to enjoy the confusion of a\r\ndetection, gave order to \"cloak all,\" with which Ogle, after some\r\nhesitation, was obliged to comply; although he could not cloak, he said\r\nhe would petticoat with the best of them. Such as are curious to know\r\nmore of the history, the duels, and odd pranks of this mad fellow, may\r\nconsult the account of them in the \"Memoirs of Gamesters,\" 1714, 12mo,\r\np. 183 (Nichols).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 85:\r\n\r\n    \"When pulpit drum ecclesiastic\r\n    Was beat with fist instead of a stick.\"\r\n              --\"Hudibras,\" Part I. c. i. line 10.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 86: Cf.

Several authors have treated of silence as a part of\r\nduty and discretion, but none of them have considered it in this light.\r\nHomer compares the noise and clamour of the Trojans advancing towards\r\nthe enemy, to the cackling of cranes when they invade an army of\r\npigmies.[89] On the contrary, he makes his countrymen and favourites,\r\nthe Greeks, move forward in a regular determined march, and in the depth\r\nof silence. I find in the accounts which are given us of some of the\r\nmore Eastern nations, where the inhabitants are disposed by their\r\nconstitutions and climates to higher strains of thought, and more\r\nelevated raptures than what we feel in the northern regions of the\r\nworld, that silence is a religious exercise among them. For when their\r\npublic devotions are in the greatest fervour, and their hearts lifted up\r\nas high as words can raise them, there are certain suspensions of sound\r\nand motion for a time, in which the mind is left to itself, and supposed\r\nto swell with such secret conceptions as are too big for utterance. I\r\nhave myself been wonderfully delighted with a masterpiece of music, when\r\nin the very tumult and ferment of their harmony, all the voices and\r\ninstruments have stopped short on a sudden, and after a little pause\r\nrecovered themselves again as it were, and renewed the concert in all\r\nits parts. Methought this short interval of silence has had more music\r\nin it than any the same space of time before or after it. There are two\r\ninstances of silence in the two greatest poets that ever wrote, which\r\nhave something in them as sublime as any of the speeches in their whole\r\nworks. The first is that of Ajax, in the eleventh book of the\r\nOdyssey.[90] Ulysses, who had been the rival of this great man in his\r\nlife, as well as the occasion of his death, upon meeting his shade in\r\nthe region of departed heroes, makes his submission to him with a\r\nhumility next to adoration, which the other passes over with dumb sullen\r\nmajesty, and such a silence, as (to use the words of Longinus) had more\r\ngreatness in it than anything he could have spoken.\r\n\r\nThe next instance I shall mention is in Virgil, where the poet,\r\ndoubtless, imitates this silence of Ajax in that of Dido;[91] though I\r\ndo not know that any of his commentators have taken notice of it. Æneas\r\nfinding among the shades of despairing lovers, the ghost of her who had\r\nlately died for him, with the wound still fresh upon her, addresses\r\nhimself to her with expanded arms, floods of tears, and the most\r\npassionate professions of his own innocence as to what had happened; all\r\nwhich Dido receives with the dignity and disdain of a resenting lover,\r\nand an injured Queen; and is so far from vouchsafing him an answer, that\r\nshe does not give him a single look. The poet represents her as turning\r\naway her face from him while he spoke to her; and after having kept her\r\neyes for some time upon the ground, as one that heard and contemned his\r\nprotestations, flying from him into the grove of myrtle, and into the\r\narms of another, whose fidelity had deserved her love.[92]\r\n\r\nI have often thought our writers of tragedy have been very defective in\r\nthis particular, and that they might have given great beauty to their\r\nworks, by certain stops and pauses in the representation of such\r\npassions, as it is not in the power of language to express. There is\r\nsomething like this in the last act of \"Venice Preserved,\" where Pierre\r\nis brought to an infamous execution, and begs of his friend,[93] as a\r\nreparation for past injuries, and the only favour he could do him, to\r\nrescue him from the ignominy of the wheel by stabbing him. As he is\r\ngoing to make this dreadful request, he is not able to communicate it,\r\nbut withdraws his face from his friend's ear, and bursts into tears.\r\nThe melancholy silence that follows hereupon, and continues till he has\r\nrecovered himself enough to reveal his mind to his friend, raises in the\r\nspectators a grief that is inexpressible, and an idea of such a\r\ncomplicated distress in the actor as words cannot utter. It would look\r\nas ridiculous to many readers to give rules and directions for proper\r\nsilences, as for penning a whisper: but it is certain, that in the\r\nextremity of most passions, particularly surprise, admiration,\r\nastonishment, nay, rage itself, there is nothing more graceful than to\r\nsee the play stand still for a few moments, and the audience fixed in an\r\nagreeable suspense during the silence of a skilful actor.\r\n\r\nBut silence never shows itself to so great an advantage, as when it is\r\nmade the reply to calumny and defamation, provided that we give no just\r\noccasion for them. One might produce an example of it in the behaviour\r\nof one in whom it appeared in all its majesty, and one whose silence, as\r\nwell as his person, was altogether divine. When one considers this\r\nsubject only in its sublimity, this great instance could not but occur\r\nto me; and since I only make use of it to show the highest example of\r\nit, I hope I do not offend in it. To forbear replying to an unjust\r\nreproach, and overlook it with a generous, or (if possible) with an\r\nentire neglect of it, is one of the most heroic acts of a great mind.\r\nAnd I must confess, when I reflect upon the behaviour of some of the\r\ngreatest men in antiquity, I do not so much admire them that they\r\ndeserved the praise of the whole age they lived in, as because they\r\ncontemned the envy and detraction of it.\r\n\r\nAll that is incumbent on a man of worth, who suffers under so ill a\r\ntreatment, is to lie by for some time in silence and obscurity, till the\r\nprejudice of the times be over, and his reputation cleared. I have often\r\nread with a great deal of pleasure a legacy of the famous Lord Bacon,\r\none of the greatest geniuses that our own or any country has produced:\r\nafter having bequeathed his soul, body, and estate, in the usual form,\r\nhe adds, \"My name and memory I leave to foreign nations, and to my\r\ncountrymen, after some time be passed over.\"\r\n\r\nAt the same time that I recommend this philosophy to others, I must\r\nconfess I am so poor a proficient in it myself, that if in the course of\r\nmy Lucubrations it happens, as it has done more than once, that my paper\r\nis duller than in conscience it ought to be, I think the time an age\r\ntill I have an opportunity of putting out another, and growing famous\r\nagain for two days.\r\n\r\nI must not close my discourse upon silence, without informing my reader,\r\nthat I have by me an elaborate treatise on the Aposiopesis called an \"Et\r\ncætera,\" it being a figure much used by some learned authors, and\r\nparticularly by the great Littleton, who, as my Lord Chief Justice Coke\r\nobserves, had a most admirable talent at an et cetera.[94]\r\n\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT.\r\n\r\nTo oblige the Pretty Fellows, and my fair readers, I have thought fit to\r\ninsert the whole passage above mentioned relating to Dido, as it is\r\ntranslated by Mr. Dryden:\r\n\r\n    _Not far from thence, the mournful fields appear;\r\n    So called, from lovers that inhabit there.\r\n    The souls, whom that unhappy flame invades,\r\n    In secret solitude, and myrtle shades,\r\n    Make endless moans, and pining with desire,\r\n    Lament too late their unextinguished fire.\r\n    Here Procris, Eryphile here, he found\r\n    Baring her breast, yet bleeding with the wound\r\n    Made by her son. He saw Pasiphae there,\r\n    With Phædra's ghost, a foul incestuous pair;\r\n    There Laodamia with Evadne moves:\r\n    Unhappy both, but loyal in their loves.\r\n    Cæneus, a woman once, and once a man;\r\n    But ending in the sex she first began.\r\n    Not far from these, Phoenician Dido stood;\r\n    Fresh from her wound, her bosom bathed in blood.\r\n    Whom, when the Trojan hero hardly knew,\r\n    Obscure in shades, and with a doubtful view\r\n    (Doubtful as he who runs through dusky night,\r\n    Or thinks he sees the moon's uncertain light)\r\n    With tears he first approached the sullen shade;\r\n    And, as his love inspired him, thus he said:\r\n    \"Unhappy queen! Then is the common breath\r\n    Of rumour true, in your reported death;\r\n    And I, alas, the cause! By Heaven, I vow,\r\n    And all the powers that rule the realms below,\r\n    Unwilling I forsook your friendly state,\r\n    Commanded by the gods, and forced by Fate.\r\n    Those gods, that Fate, whose unresisted might,\r\n    Have sent me to these regions, void of light,\r\n    Through the vast empire of eternal night.\r\n    Nor dared I to presume, that, pressed with grief,\r\n    My flight should urge you to this dire relief.\r\n    Stay, stay your steps, and listen to my vows;\r\n    'Tis the last interview that Fate allows!\"\r\n    In vain he thus attempts her mind to move,\r\n    With tears and prayers, and late repenting love.\r\n    Disdainfully she looked, then turning round;\r\n    But fixed her eyes unmoved upon the ground;\r\n    And, what he says, and swears, regards no more\r\n    Than the deaf rocks, when the loud billows roar;\r\n    But whirled away, to shun his hateful fight,\r\n    Hid in the forest, and the shades of night.\r\n    Then sought Sichæus through the shady grove,\r\n    Who answered all her cares, and equalled all her love._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 89: \"Iliad,\" iii. 3.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 90: \"Odyssey,\" xi. 563.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 91: \"Æneid,\" vi. 46.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 92: Sichæus.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 93: Jaffier.

He seemed to me to\r\nstrain his voice more than ordinary, as if he designed to make himself\r\nheard to the remotest corner of this lane. Having entertained myself a\r\nlittle before I went to bed with a discourse on the transmigration of\r\nmen into other animals, I could not but fancy that this was the soul of\r\nsome drowsy bellman who used to sleep upon his post, for which he was\r\ncondemned to do penance in feathers, and distinguish the several watches\r\nof the night under the outside of a cock. While I was thinking of the\r\ncondition of this poor bellman in masquerade, I heard a great knocking\r\nat my door, and was soon after told by my maid, that my worthy friend\r\nthe tall black gentleman, who frequents the coffee-houses hereabouts,\r\ndesired to speak with me. This ancient Pythagorean, who has as much\r\nhonesty as any man living, but good nature to an excess, brought me the\r\nfollowing petition, which I am apt to believe he penned himself, the\r\npetitioner not being able to express his mind in paper under his present\r\nform, however famous he might have been for writing verses when he was\r\nin his original shape.\r\n\r\n     \"_To Isaac Bickerstaff, Esq., Censor of Great Britain._\r\n\r\n     \"The humble petition of Job Chanticleer, in behalf of himself, and\r\n     many other poor sufferers in the same condition;\r\n\r\n     \"SHEWETH,\r\n\r\n     \"That whereas your petitioner is truly descended of the ancient\r\n     family of the Chanticleers at Cock Hall near Romford in Essex, it\r\n     has been his misfortune to come into the mercenary hands of a\r\n     certain ill-disposed person, commonly called a 'higgler,' who,\r\n     under the close confinement of a pannier, has conveyed him and many\r\n     others up to London; but hearing by chance of your worship's great\r\n     humanity towards robin-redbreasts and tom-tits,[95] he is\r\n     emboldened to beseech you to take his deplorable condition into\r\n     your tender consideration, who otherwise must suffer (with many\r\n     thousands more as innocent as himself) that inhumane barbarity of a\r\n     Shrove Tuesday persecution.[96] We humbly hope that our courage and\r\n     vigilance may plead for us on this occasion.\r\n\r\n     \"Your poor petitioner most earnestly implores your immediate\r\n     protection from the insolence of the rabble, the batteries of\r\n     catsticks,[97] and a painful lingering death.\r\n\r\n                                    \"And your petitioner, &c.\r\n\r\n     \"From my coup in Clare\r\n     Market, _February 13, 1709_.\"\r\n\r\nUpon delivery of this petition, the worthy gentleman who presented it,\r\ntold me the customs of many wise nations of the East, through which he\r\nhad travelled; that nothing was more frequent than to see a dervish lay\r\nout a whole year's income in the redemption of larks or linnets that had\r\nunhappily fallen into the hands of bird-catchers:[98] that it was also\r\nusual to run between a dog and a bull to keep them from hurting one\r\nanother, or to lose the use of a limb in parting a couple of furious\r\nmastiffs. He then insisted upon the ingratitude and disingenuity[99] of\r\ntreating in this manner a necessary and domestic animal, that has made\r\nthe whole house keep good hours, and called up the cook maid for five\r\nyears together. \"What would a Turk say,\" continued he, \"should he hear,\r\nthat it is a common entertainment in a nation which pretends to be one\r\nof the most civilised of Europe, to tie an innocent animal to a stake,\r\nand put him to an ignominious death, who has perhaps been the guardian\r\nand proveditor of a poor family, as long as he was able to get eggs for\r\nhis mistress?\"\r\n\r\nI thought what this gentleman said was very reasonable; and have often\r\nwondered, that we do not lay aside a custom which makes us appear\r\nbarbarous to nations much more rude and unpolished than ourselves. Some\r\nFrench writers have represented this diversion of the common people much\r\nto our disadvantage, and imputed it to natural fierceness and cruelty of\r\ntemper; as they do some other entertainments peculiar to our nation: I\r\nmean those elegant diversions of bull-baiting and prize-fighting, with\r\nthe like ingenious recreations of the bear-garden.[100] I wish I knew\r\nhow to answer this reproach which is cast upon us, and excuse the death\r\nof so many innocent cocks, bulls, dogs, and bears, as have been set\r\ntogether by the ears, or died untimely deaths only to make us sport.\r\n\r\nIt will be said, that these are the entertainments of common people. It\r\nis true; but they are the entertainments of no other common people.[101]\r\nBesides, I am afraid there is a tincture of the same savage spirit in\r\nthe diversions of those of higher rank, and more refined relish. Rapin\r\nobserves, that the English theatre very much delights in bloodshed,\r\nwhich he likewise represents as an indication of our tempers. I must\r\nown, there is something very horrid in the public executions of an\r\nEnglish tragedy. Stabbing and poisoning, which are performed behind the\r\nscenes in other nations, must be done openly among us, to gratify the\r\naudience.[102]\r\n\r\nWhen poor Sandford[103] was upon the stage, I have seen him groaning\r\nupon a wheel, stuck with daggers, impaled alive, calling his\r\nexecutioners, with a dying voice, cruel dogs and villains! And all this\r\nto please his judicious spectators, who were wonderfully delighted with\r\nseeing a man in torment so well acted. The truth of it is, the\r\npoliteness of our English stage, in regard to decorum, is very\r\nextraordinary. We act murders to show our intrepidity, and adulteries to\r\nshow our gallantry: both of them are frequent in our most taking plays,\r\nwith this difference only, that the first are done in sight of the\r\naudience, and the other wrought up to such a height upon the stage, that\r\nthey are almost put in execution before the actors can get behind the\r\nscenes.\r\n\r\nI would not have it thought, that there is just ground for those\r\nconsequences which our enemies draw against us from these practices; but\r\nmethinks one would be sorry for any manner of occasion for such\r\nmisrepresentations of us. The virtues of tenderness, compassion and\r\nhumanity, are those by which men are distinguished from brutes, as much\r\nas by reason itself; and it would be the greatest reproach to a nation\r\nto distinguish itself from all others by any defect in these particular\r\nvirtues. For which reasons, I hope that my dear countrymen will no\r\nlonger expose themselves by an effusion of blood, whether it be of\r\ntheatrical heroes, cocks, or any other innocent animals, which we are\r\nnot obliged to slaughter for our safety, convenience, or nourishment.\r\nWhere any of these ends are not served in the destruction of a living\r\ncreature, I cannot but pronounce it a great piece of cruelty, if not a\r\nkind of murder.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 95: See No. 112.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 96: See the date of this number.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 97: Sticks used in the game of tip-cat and trap-ball.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 98: Cf. the _Spectator_, No. 343, where Addison refers to Sir\r\nPaul Rycaut's work on the Ottoman Empire.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 99: Disingenuousness.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 100: See Nos. 28, 31.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 101: \"Cock-fighting is diverting enough, the anger and\r\neagerness of these little creatures, and the triumphant crowing of a\r\ncock when he strutts haughtily on the body of his enemy, has something\r\nin't singular and pleasant.

To set therefore this matter in a\r\nclear light, I must declare, that no one can have a greater veneration\r\nthan myself for the freethinkers of antiquity, who acted the same part\r\nin those times, as the great men of the Reformation did in several\r\nnations of Europe, by exerting themselves against the idolatry and\r\nsuperstition of the times in which they lived. It was by this noble\r\nimpulse that Socrates and his disciples, as well as all the\r\nphilosophers of note in Greece, and Cicero, Seneca, with all the learned\r\nmen of Rome, endeavoured to enlighten their contemporaries amidst the\r\ndarkness and ignorance in which the world was then sunk and buried. The\r\ngreat points which these freethinkers endeavoured to establish and\r\ninculcate into the minds of men, were, the formation of the universe,\r\nthe superintendency of Providence, the perfection of the divine nature,\r\nthe immortality of the soul, and the future state of rewards and\r\npunishments. They all complied with the religion of their country, as\r\nmuch as possible, in such particulars as did not contradict and pervert\r\nthese great and fundamental doctrines of mankind. On the contrary, the\r\npersons who now set up for freethinkers, are such as endeavour by a\r\nlittle trash of words and sophistry, to weaken and destroy those very\r\nprinciples, for the vindication of which, freedom of thought at first\r\nbecame laudable and heroic.[104] These apostates, from reason and good\r\nsense, can look at the glorious frame of Nature, without paying an\r\nadoration to Him that raised it; can consider the great revolutions in\r\nthe universe, without lifting up their minds to that Superior Power\r\nwhich hath the direction of it; can presume to censure the Deity in His\r\nways towards men; can level mankind with the beasts that perish; can\r\nextinguish in their own minds all the pleasing hopes of a future state,\r\nand lull themselves into a stupid security against the terrors of it. If\r\none were to take the word \"priestcraft\" out of the mouths of these\r\nshallow monsters, they would be immediately struck dumb. It is by the\r\nhelp of this single term that they endeavour to disappoint the good\r\nworks of the most learned and venerable order of men, and harden the\r\nhearts of the ignorant against the very light of Nature, and the common\r\nreceived notions of mankind. We ought not to treat such miscreants as\r\nthese upon the foot of fair disputants, but to pour out contempt upon\r\nthem, and speak of them with scorn and infamy, as the pests of society,\r\nthe revilers of human nature, and the blasphemers of a Being, whom a\r\ngood man would rather die than hear dishonoured. Cicero, after having\r\nmentioned the great heroes of knowledge that recommended this divine\r\ndoctrine of the immortality of the soul, calls those small pretenders to\r\nwisdom who declared against it, certain minute philosophers,[105] using\r\na diminutive even of the word \"little,\" to express the despicable\r\nopinion he had of them. The contempt he throws upon them in another\r\npassage[106] is yet more remarkable, where, to show the mean thoughts he\r\nentertains of them, he declares, he would rather be in the wrong with\r\nPlato, than in the right with such company. There is indeed nothing in\r\nthe world so ridiculous as one of these grave philosophical\r\nfreethinkers, that hath neither passions nor appetites to gratify, no\r\nheats of blood nor vigour of constitution that can turn his systems of\r\ninfidelity to his advantage, or raise pleasures out of them which are\r\ninconsistent with the belief of a hereafter. One that has neither wit,\r\ngallantry, mirth, nor youth, to indulge by these notions, but only a\r\npoor, joyless, uncomfortable vanity of distinguishing himself from the\r\nrest of mankind, is rather to be regarded as a mischievous lunatic,\r\nthan a mistaken philosopher. A chaste infidel, a speculative libertine,\r\nis an animal that I should not believe to be in Nature, did I not\r\nsometimes meet with this species of men, that plead for the indulgence\r\nof their passions in the midst of a severe studious life, and talk\r\nagainst the immortality of the soul over a dish of coffee.\r\n\r\nI would fain ask a minute philosopher, what good he proposes to mankind\r\nby the publishing of his doctrines? Will they make a man a better\r\ncitizen, or father of a family; a more endearing husband, friend, or\r\nson? Will they enlarge his public or private virtues, or correct any of\r\nhis frailties or vices? What is there either joyful or glorious in such\r\nopinions? Do they either refresh or enlarge our thoughts? Do they\r\ncontribute to the happiness, or raise the dignity of human nature? The\r\nonly good that I have ever heard pretended to, is, that they banish\r\nterrors, and set the mind at ease. But whose terrors do they banish? It\r\nis certain, if there were any strength in their arguments, they would\r\ngive great disturbance to minds that are influenced by virtue, honour,\r\nand morality, and take from us the only comforts and supports of\r\naffliction, sickness, and old age. The minds therefore which they set at\r\nease, are only those of impenitent criminals and malefactors, and which,\r\nto the good of mankind, should be in perpetual terror and alarm.\r\n\r\nI must confess, nothing is more usual than for a freethinker, in\r\nproportion as the insolence of scepticism is abated in him by years and\r\nknowledge, or humbled and beaten down by sorrow or sickness, to\r\nreconcile himself to the general conceptions of reasonable creatures; so\r\nthat we frequently see the apostates turning from their revolt toward\r\nthe end of their lives, and employing the refuse of their parts in\r\npromoting those truths which they had before endeavoured to invalidate.\r\n\r\nThe history of a gentleman in France is very well known, who was so\r\nzealous a promoter of infidelity, that he had got together a select\r\ncompany of disciples, and travelled into all parts of the kingdom to\r\nmake converts. In the midst of his fantastical success he fell sick, and\r\nwas reclaimed to such a sense of his condition, that after he had passed\r\nsome time in great agonies and horrors of mind, he begged those who had\r\nthe care of burying him, to dress his body in the habit of a Capuchin,\r\nthat the devil might not run away with it; and to do further justice\r\nupon himself, desired them to tie a halter about his neck, as a mark of\r\nthat ignominious punishment, which in his own thoughts he had so justly\r\ndeserved.\r\n\r\nI would not have persecution so far disgraced, as to wish these vermin\r\nmight be animadverted on by any legal penalties; though I think it would\r\nbe highly reasonable, that those few of them who die in the professions\r\nof their infidelity, should have such tokens of infamy fixed upon them,\r\nas might distinguish those bodies which are given up by the owners to\r\noblivion and putrefaction, from those which rest in hope, and shall rise\r\nin glory. But at the same time that I am against doing them the honour\r\nof the notice of our laws, which ought not to suppose there are such\r\ncriminals in being, I have often wondered how they can be tolerated in\r\nany mixed conversations while they are venting these absurd opinions;\r\nand should think, that if on any such occasion half a dozen of the most\r\nrobust Christians in the company would lead one of these gentlemen to a\r\npump, or convey him into a blanket, they would do very good service both\r\nto Church and State. I do not know how the laws stand in this\r\nparticular; but I hope, whatever knocks, bangs or thumps might be given\r\nwith such an honest intention, would not be construed as a breach of the\r\npeace. I daresay they would not be returned by the person who receives\r\nthem; for whatever these fools may say in the vanity of their hearts,\r\nthey are too wise to risk their lives upon the uncertainty of their\r\nopinions.\r\n\r\nWhen I was a young man about this town, I frequented the ordinary of the\r\nBlack Horse, in Holborn, where the person that usually presided at the\r\ntable was a rough old-fashioned gentleman, who, according to the custom\r\nof those times, had been the major and preacher of a regiment. It\r\nhappened one day that a noisy young officer, bred in France, was venting\r\nsome new-fangled notions, and speaking, in the gaiety of his humour,\r\nagainst the dispensations of Providence. The major at first only desired\r\nhim to talk more respectfully of one for whom all the company had an\r\nhonour; but finding him run on in his extravagance, began to reprimand\r\nhim after a more serious manner. \"Young man,\" said he, \"do not abuse\r\nyour Benefactor whilst you are eating His bread. Consider whose air you\r\nbreathe, whose presence you are in, and who it is that gave you the\r\npower of that very speech which you make use of to His dishonour.\" The\r\nyoung fellow, who thought to turn matters into a jest, asked him if he\r\nwas going to preach; but at the same time desired him to take care what\r\nhe said when he spoke to a man of honour. \"A man of honour?\" says the\r\nmajor, \"thou art an infidel and a blasphemer, and I shall use thee as\r\nsuch.\" In short, the quarrel ran so high, that the major was desired to\r\nwalk out. Upon their coming into the garden, the old fellow advised his\r\nantagonist to consider the place into which one pass might drive him;\r\nbut finding him grow upon him to a degree of scurrility, as believing\r\nthe advice proceeded from fear; \"Sirrah,\" says he, \"if a thunderbolt\r\ndoes not strike thee dead before I come at thee, I shall not fail to\r\nchastise thee for thy profaneness to thy Maker, and thy sauciness to His\r\nservant.\" Upon this he drew his sword, and cried out with a loud voice,\r\n\"The sword of the Lord and of Gideon\"; which so terrified his\r\nantagonist, that he was immediately disarmed, and thrown upon his knees.\r\nIn this posture he begged his life; but the major refused to grant it,\r\nbefore he had asked pardon for his offence in a short extemporary prayer\r\nwhich the old gentleman dictated to him upon the spot, and which his\r\nproselyte repeated after him in the presence of the whole ordinary, that\r\nwere now gathered about him in the garden.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 104: In speaking of Collins' \"Discourse of Free-Thinking\"\r\n(1713) in the _Guardian_ (No. 9), Steele says: \"I cannot see any\r\npossible interpretation to give this work, but a design to subvert and\r\nridicule the authority of scripture.

These\r\nlive in that mutual confidence of each other, which renders the\r\nsatisfactions of marriage even greater than those of friendship, and\r\nmakes wife and husband the dearest appellations of human life. Mr.\r\nBallance is a merchant of good consideration, and understands the world\r\nnot from speculation, but practice. His wife is the daughter of an\r\nhonest house, ever bred in a family-way; and has, from a natural good\r\nunderstanding, and great innocence, a freedom which men of sense know to\r\nbe the certain sign of virtue, and fools take to be an encouragement to\r\nvice.\r\n\r\nTom Varnish, a young gentleman of the Middle Temple, by the bounty of a\r\ngood father who was so obliging as to die, and leave him in his\r\ntwenty-fourth year, besides a good estate, a large sum, which lay in the\r\nhands of Mr. Ballance, had by this means an intimacy at his house; and\r\nbeing one of those hard students who read plays for improvement in the\r\nlaw, took his rules of life from thence. Upon mature deliberation, he\r\nconceived it very proper, that he, as a man of wit and pleasure of the\r\ntown, should have an intrigue with his merchant's wife. He no sooner\r\nthought of this adventure, but he began it by an amorous epistle to the\r\nlady, and a faithful promise to wait upon her, at a certain hour the\r\nnext evening, when he knew her husband was to be absent.\r\n\r\nThe letter was no sooner received, but it was communicated to the\r\nhusband, and produced no other effect in him, than that he joined with\r\nhis wife to raise all the mirth they could out of this fantastical piece\r\nof gallantry. They were so little concerned at this dangerous man of\r\nmode, that they plotted ways to perplex him without hurting him. Varnish\r\ncomes exactly at his hour; and the lady's well-acted confusion at his\r\nentrance, gave him opportunity to repeat some couplets very fit for the\r\noccasion with very much grace and spirit. His theatrical manner of\r\nmaking love was interrupted by an alarm of the husband's coming; and the\r\nwife, in a personated terror, beseeched him, if he had any value for the\r\nhonour of a woman that loved him, he would jump out of the window. He\r\ndid so, and fell upon feather-beds placed on purpose to receive him.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be conceived how great the joy of an amorous man is when he\r\nhas suffered for his mistress, and is never the worse for it. Varnish\r\nthe next day writ a most elegant billet, wherein he said all that\r\nimagination could form upon the occasion. He violently protested, going\r\nout of the window was no way terrible, but as it was going from her;\r\nwith several other kind expressions, which procured him a second\r\nassignation. Upon his second visit, he was conveyed by a faithful maid\r\ninto her bedchamber, and left there to expect the arrival of her\r\nmistress. But the wench, according to her instructions, ran in again to\r\nhim, and locked the door after her to keep out her master. She had just\r\ntime enough to convey the lover into a chest before she admitted the\r\nhusband and his wife into the room.\r\n\r\nYou may be sure that trunk was absolutely necessary to be opened; but\r\nupon her husband's ordering it, she assured him, she had taken all the\r\ncare imaginable in packing up the things with her own hand, and he might\r\nsend the trunk aboard as soon as he thought fit. The easy husband\r\nbelieved his wife, and the good couple went to bed; Varnish having the\r\nhappiness to pass the night in his mistress's bedchamber without\r\nmolestation. The morning arose, but our lover was not well situated to\r\nobserve her blushes; so that all we know of his sentiments on this\r\noccasion, is, that he heard Ballance ask for the key, and say, he would\r\nhimself go with this chest, and have it opened before the captain of the\r\nship, for the greater safety of so valuable a lading.\r\n\r\nThe goods were hoisted away, and Mr. Ballance marching by his chest with\r\ngreat care and diligence, omitted nothing that might give his passenger\r\nperplexity. But to consummate all, he delivered the chest, with strict\r\ncharge, in case they were in danger of being taken, to throw it\r\noverboard, for there were letters in it, the matter of which might be of\r\ngreat service to the enemy.\r\n\r\nN.B. It is not thought advisable to proceed further in this account, Mr.\r\nVarnish being just returned from his travels, and willing to conceal the\r\noccasion of his first applying himself to the languages.\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. James's Coffee-house, February 20._\r\n\r\nThis day came in a mail from Holland, with a confirmation of our late\r\nadvices, that a treaty of peace would very suddenly be set on foot, and\r\nthat yachts were appointed by the States to convey the Ministers of\r\nFrance from Moerdyk to Gertruydenburg, which is appointed for the place\r\nwherein this important negotiation is to be transacted. It is said, this\r\naffair has been in agitation ever since the close of the last campaign;\r\nMonsieur Petticum having been appointed to receive from time to time the\r\novertures of the enemy. During the whole winter, the Ministers of France\r\nhave used their utmost skill in forming such answers as might amuse the\r\nAllies, in hopes of a favourable event; either in the north, or some\r\nother part of Europe, which might affect some part of the alliance too\r\nnearly to leave it in a capacity of adhering firmly to the interest of\r\nthe whole. In all this transaction, the French king's own name has been\r\nas little made use of as possible: but the season of the year advancing\r\ntoo fast to admit of much longer delays in the present condition of\r\nFrance, Monsieur Torcy, in the name of the king, sent a letter to\r\nMonsieur Petticum, wherein he says, that \"the king is willing all the\r\npreliminary articles shall rest as they are during the treaty for the\r\n37th.\"\r\n\r\nUpon the receipt of this advice, passports were sent to the French\r\nCourt, and their Ministers are expected at Moerdyk on the 5th of the\r\nnext month.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sheer Lane, February 20._\r\n\r\nI have been earnestly solicited for a further term, for wearing the\r\nfarthingale by several of the fair sex, but more especially by the\r\nfollowing petitioners:\r\n\r\n     \"The humble petition of Deborah Hark, Sarah Threadpaper and Rachael\r\n     Thimble, spinsters, and single women, commonly called\r\n     Waiting-maids, in behalf of themselves and their sisterhood;\r\n\r\n     \"SHEWETH,\r\n\r\n     \"That your Worship hath been pleased to order and command, that no\r\n     person or persons shall presume to wear quilted petticoats, on\r\n     forfeiture of the said petticoats, or penalty of wearing ruffs,\r\n     after the 17th instant now expired.\r\n\r\n     \"That your petitioners have time out of mind been entitled to wear\r\n     their ladies' clothes, or to sell the same.\r\n\r\n     \"That the sale of the said clothes is spoiled by your Worship's\r\n     said prohibition.\r\n\r\n     \"Your petitioners therefore most humbly pray, that your Worship\r\n     would please to allow, that all gentlewomen's gentlewomen may be\r\n     allowed to wear the said dress, or to repair the loss of such a\r\n     perquisite in such manner as your Worship shall think fit.\r\n\r\n     \"And your petitioners,\" &c.\r\n\r\nI do allow the allegations of this petition to be just, and forbid all\r\npersons but the petitioners, or those who shall purchase from them, to\r\nwear the said garment after the date hereof.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 107: Nichols suggests that this paper may be by Addison, and\r\nit is certainly not unlikely that he was the author of the \"History of\r\nTom Varnish.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 137.

He was\r\nbewailing to me in very just terms, the offences which he frequently met\r\nwith in the abuse of speech: some use ten times more words than they\r\nneed, some put in words quite foreign to their purpose, and others adorn\r\ntheir discourses with oaths and blasphemies by way of tropes and\r\nfigures. What my good friend started, dwelt upon me after I came home\r\nthis evening, and led me into an inquiry with myself, whence should\r\narise such strange excrescences in discourse? Whereas it must be obvious\r\nto all reasonable beings, that the sooner a man speaks his mind, the\r\nmore complaisant he is to the man with whom he talks: but upon mature\r\ndeliberation, I am come to this resolution, that for one man who speaks\r\nto be understood, there are ten who talk only to be admired.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Greeks had little independent syllables called \"expletives,\"\r\nwhich they brought into their discourses both in verse and prose, for no\r\nother purpose but for the better grace and sound of their sentences and\r\nperiods. I know no example but this which can authorise the use of more\r\nwords than are necessary. But whether it be from this freedom taken by\r\nthat wise nation, or however it arises, Dick Reptile hit upon a very\r\njust and common cause of offence in the generality of the people of all\r\norders. We have one here in our lane who speaks nothing without quoting\r\nan authority; for it is always with him, so and so, \"as the man said.\"\r\nHe asked me this morning, how I did, \"as the man said\"; and hoped I\r\nwould come now and then to see him, \"as the man said.\" I am acquainted\r\nwith another, who never delivers himself upon any subject, but he cries,\r\nhe only speaks his \"poor judgment\"; this is his humble opinion; or as\r\nfor his part, if he might presume to offer anything on that subject. But\r\nof all the persons who add elegances and superfluities to their\r\ndiscourses, those who deserve the foremost rank, are the swearers; and\r\nthe lump of these may, I think, be very aptly divided into the common\r\ndistinction of high and low. Dulness and barrenness of thought is the\r\noriginal of it in both these sects, and they differ only in\r\nconstitution: the low is generally a phlegmatic, and the high a choleric\r\ncoxcomb. The man of phlegm is sensible of the emptiness of his\r\ndiscourse, and will tell you, that \"I'fackins,\" such a thing is true: or\r\nif you warm him a little, he may run into passion, and cry,\r\n\"Odsbodikins,\" you do not say right. But the high affects a sublimity in\r\ndulness, and invokes hell and damnation at the breaking of a glass, or\r\nthe slowness of a drawer.\r\n\r\nI was the other day trudging along Fleet Street on foot, and an old army\r\nfriend came up with me. We were both going towards Westminster, and\r\nfinding the streets were so crowded that we could not keep together, we\r\nresolved to club for a coach. This gentleman I knew to be the first of\r\nthe order of the choleric. I must confess (were there no crime in it),\r\nnothing could be more diverting than the impertinence of the high juror:\r\nfor whether there is remedy or not against what offends him, still he\r\nis to show he is offended; and he must sure not omit to be\r\nmagnificently passionate, by falling on all things in his way. We were\r\nstopped by a train of coaches at Temple Bar. \"What the devil!\" says my\r\ncompanion, \"cannot you drive on, coachman? D----n you all, for a set of\r\nsons of whores, you will stop here to be paid by the hour! There is not\r\nsuch a set of confounded dogs as the coachmen unhanged! But these\r\nrascally Cits---- 'Ounds, why should not there be a tax to make these\r\ndogs widen their gates? Oh! but the hell-hounds move at last.\" \"Ay,\"\r\nsaid I, \"I knew you would make them whip on if once they heard you.\"\r\n\"No,\" says he; \"but would it not fret a man to the devil, to pay for\r\nbeing carried slower than he can walk? Lookee, there is for ever a stop\r\nat this hole by St. Clement's Church. Blood, you dog!--Harkee,\r\nsirrah,--why, and be d----d to you, do not you drive over that fellow?\r\nThunder, furies, and damnation! I'll cut your ears off, you fellow\r\nbefore there. Come hither, you dog you, and let me wring your neck round\r\nyour shoulders.\" We had a repetition of the same eloquence at the\r\nCockpit,[108] and the turning into Palace Yard.\r\n\r\nThis gave me a perfect image of the insignificancy of the creatures who\r\npractise this enormity; and made me conclude, that it is ever want of\r\nsense makes a man guilty in this kind. It was excellently well said,\r\nthat this folly had no temptation to excuse it, no man being born of a\r\nswearing constitution. In a word, a few rumbling words and consonants\r\nclapped together, without any sense, will make an accomplished swearer:\r\nand it is needless to dwell long upon this blustering impertinence,\r\nwhich is already banished out of the society of well-bred men, and can\r\nbe useful only to bullies and ill tragic writers, who would have sound\r\nand noise pass for courage and sense.\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. James's Coffee-house, February 22._\r\n\r\nThere arrived a messenger last night from Harwich, who left that place\r\njust as the Duke of Marlborough was going on board. The character of\r\nthis important general going out by the command of his Queen, and at the\r\nrequest of his country, puts me in mind of that noble figure which\r\nShakespeare gives Harry the Fifth upon his expedition against France.\r\nThe poet wishes for abilities to represent so great a hero:\r\n\r\n    \"_Oh for a muse of fire!\" says he,\r\n    \"Then should the warlike Harry, like himself,\r\n    Assume the port of Mars; and at his heels,\r\n    Leashed in, like hounds, should Famine, Sword and Fire\r\n    Crouch for employment._\"[109]\r\n\r\nA conqueror drawn like the god of battle, with such a dreadful leash of\r\nhell-hounds at his command, makes a picture of as much majesty and\r\nterror as is to be met with in any poet.\r\n\r\nShakespeare understood the force of this particular allegory so well,\r\nthat he had it in his thoughts in another passage, which is altogether\r\nas daring and sublime as the former. What I mean, is in the tragedy of\r\n\"Julius Cæsar,\" where Antony, after having foretold the bloodshed and\r\ndestruction that should be brought upon the earth by the death of that\r\ngreat man; to fill up the horror of his description, adds the following\r\nverses:\r\n\r\n    \"_And Cæsar's spirit ranging for revenge,\r\n    With Ate by his side, come hot from Hell,\r\n    Shall in these confines, with a monarch's voice,\r\n    Cry 'Havoc'; and let slip the dogs of war._\"[110]\r\n\r\nI do not question but these quotations will call to mind in my readers\r\nof learning and taste, that imaginary person described by Virgil with\r\nthe same spirit. He mentions it upon the occasion of a peace which was\r\nrestored to the Roman Empire, and which we may now hope for from the\r\ndeparture of that great man who has given occasion to these reflections.\r\n\"The Temple of Janus,\" says he, \"shall be shut, and in the midst of it\r\nMilitary Fury shall sit upon a pile of broken arms, loaded with a\r\nhundred chains, bellowing with madness, and grinding his teeth in blood.\r\n\r\n    \"_Claudentur belli portæ; Furor impius intus,\r\n    Sæva sedens super arma, et centum vinctus ahenis\r\n    Post tergum nodis, fremit horridus ore cruento._\"[111]\r\n\r\n    \"_Janus himself before his fane shall wait,\r\n    And keep the dreadful issues of his gate,\r\n    With bolts and iron bars. Within remains\r\n    Imprisoned Fury bound in brazen chains;\r\n    High on a trophy raised of useless arms,\r\n    He sits, and threats the world with vain alarms._\"\r\n                                DRYDEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tickets which were delivered out for the benefit of Signor Nicolini\r\nGrimaldi[112] on the 24th instant, will be taken on Thursday the 2nd of\r\nMarch, his benefit being deferred till that day.\r\n\r\nN.B.

But the generality of the world are so far\r\nfrom walking by any such maxim, that it is almost a standing rule to do\r\nas others do, or be ridiculous. I have heard my old friend Mr. Hart[114]\r\nspeak it as an observation among the players, that it is impossible to\r\nact with grace, except the actor has forgot that he is before an\r\naudience. Till he has arrived at that, his motion, his air, his every\r\nstep and gesture, has something in them which discovers he is under a\r\nrestraint for fear of being ill received; or if he considers himself as\r\nin the presence of those who approve his behaviour, you see an\r\naffectation of that pleasure run through his whole carriage. It is as\r\ncommon in life, as upon the stage, to behold a man in the most\r\nindifferent action betray a sense he has of doing what he is about\r\ngracefully. Some have such an immoderate relish for applause, that they\r\nexpect it for things, which in themselves are so frivolous, that it is\r\nimpossible, without this affectation, to make them appear worthy either\r\nof blame or praise. There is Will Glare, so passionately intent upon\r\nbeing admired, that when you see him in public places, every muscle of\r\nhis face discovers his thoughts are fixed upon the consideration of what\r\nfigure he makes. He will often fall into a musing posture to attract\r\nobservation, and is then obtruding himself upon the company when he\r\npretends to be withdrawn from it. Such little arts are the certain and\r\ninfallible tokens of a superficial mind, as the avoiding observation is\r\nthe sign of a great and sublime one. It is therefore extremely difficult\r\nfor a man to judge even of his own actions, without forming to himself\r\nan idea of what he should act, were it in his power to execute all his\r\ndesires without the observation of the rest of the world. There is an\r\nallegorical fable in Plato,[115] which seems to admonish us, that we are\r\nvery little acquainted with ourselves, while we know our actions are to\r\npass the censures of others; but had we the power to accomplish all our\r\nwishes unobserved, we should then easily inform ourselves how far we are\r\npossessed of real and intrinsic virtue. The fable I was going to\r\nmention, is that of Gyges, who is said to have had an enchanted ring,\r\nwhich had in it a miraculous quality, making him who wore it visible or\r\ninvisible, as he turned it to or from his body. The use Gyges made of\r\nhis occasional invisibility, was, by the advantage of it, to violate a\r\nqueen, and murder a king. Tully takes notice of this allegory, and says\r\nvery handsomely, that a man of honour who had such a ring, would act\r\njust in the same manner as he would do without it.[116] It is indeed no\r\nsmall pitch of virtue under the temptation of impunity, and the hopes\r\nof accomplishing all a man desires, not to transgress the rules of\r\njustice and virtue; but this is rather not being an ill man, than being\r\npositively a good one; and it seems wonderful, that so great a soul as\r\nthat of Tully, should not form to himself a thousand worthy actions\r\nwhich a virtuous man would be prompted to by the possession of such a\r\nsecret. There are certainly some part of mankind who are guardian beings\r\nto the other. Sallust could say of Cato, \"that he had rather be than\r\nappear good\";[117] but indeed, this eulogium rose no higher than (as I\r\njust now hinted) to an inoffensiveness, rather than an active virtue.\r\nHad it occurred to the noble orator to represent, in his language, the\r\nglorious pleasures of a man secretly employed in beneficence and\r\ngenerosity, it would certainly have made a more charming page than any\r\nhe has now left behind him. How might a man, furnished with Gyges'\r\nsecret, employ it in bringing together distant friends, laying snares\r\nfor creating goodwill in the room of groundless hatred; in removing the\r\npangs of an unjust jealousy, the shyness of an imperfect reconciliation,\r\nand the tremor of an awful love! Such a one could give confidence to\r\nbashful merit, and confusion to overbearing impudence.\r\n\r\nCertain it is, that secret kindnesses done to mankind, are as beautiful\r\nas secret injuries are detestable. To be invisibly good, is as godlike,\r\nas to be invisibly ill, diabolical. As degenerate as we are apt to say\r\nthe age we live in is, there are still amongst us men of illustrious\r\nminds, who enjoy all the pleasures of good actions, except that of being\r\ncommended for them. There happens among others very worthy instances of\r\na public spirit, one of which I am obliged to discover, because I know\r\nnot otherwise how to obey the commands of the Benefactor. A citizen of\r\nLondon has given directions to Mr. Rayner, the writing-master of Paul's\r\nSchool,[118] to educate at his charge ten boys (who shall be nominated\r\nby me) in writing and accounts, till they shall be fit for any trade. I\r\ndesire therefore such as know any proper objects for receiving this\r\nbounty, to give notice thereof to Mr. Morphew, or Mr. Lillie, and they\r\nshall, if properly qualified, have instructions accordingly.\r\n\r\nActions of this kind have in them something so transcendent, that it is\r\nan injury to applaud them, and a diminution of that merit which consists\r\nin shunning our approbation. We shall therefore leave them to enjoy that\r\nglorious obscurity, and silently admire their virtue, who can contemn\r\nthe most delicious of human pleasures, that of receiving due praise.\r\nSuch celestial dispositions very justly suspend the discovery of their\r\nbenefactions, till they come where their actions cannot be\r\nmisinterpreted, and receive their first congratulations in the company\r\nof angels.\r\n\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT.\r\n\r\nWhereas Mr. Bickerstaff, by a letter bearing date this 24th of February,\r\nhas received information, that there are in and about the Royal Exchange\r\na sort of persons commonly known by the name of \"whetters,\"[119] who\r\ndrink themselves into an intermediate state of being neither drunk nor\r\nsober before the hours of 'change, or business, and in that condition\r\nbuy and sell stocks, discount notes, and do many other acts of\r\nwell-disposed citizens; this is to give notice, that from this day\r\nforward, no whetter shall be able to give or endorse any note, or\r\nexecute any other point of commerce, after the third half pint, before\r\nthe hour of one: and whoever shall transact any matter or matters with a\r\nwhetter (not being himself of that order) shall be conducted to\r\nMoorfields[120] upon the first application of his next of kin.\r\n\r\nN.B. No tavern near the 'Change shall deliver wine to such as drink at\r\nthe bar standing, except the same shall be three parts of the best\r\ncider; and the master of the house shall produce a certificate of the\r\nsame from Mr. Tintoret,[121] or other credible wine-painter.\r\n\r\nWhereas the model of the intended Bedlam[122] is now finished, and that\r\nthe edifice itself will be very suddenly begun; it is desired, that all\r\nsuch as have relations, whom they would recommend to our care, would\r\nbring in their proofs with all speed, none being to be admitted of\r\ncourse but lovers, who are put into an immediate regimen. Young\r\npoliticians also are received without fees or examination.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 114: See No. 99.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 115: \"Republic,\" ii. 359.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 116: \"De Officiis,\" iii. 9.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 117: \"Bell.

But indeed I must do my\r\nfemale readers the justice to own, that their tender hearts are much\r\nmore susceptible of good impressions, than the minds of the other sex.\r\nBusiness and ambition take up men's thoughts too much to leave room for\r\nphilosophy: but if you speak to women in a style and manner proper to\r\napproach them, they never fail to improve by your counsel. I shall\r\ntherefore for the future turn my thoughts more particularly to their\r\nservice, and study the best methods to adorn their persons, and inform\r\ntheir minds in the justest methods to make them what Nature designed\r\nthem, the most beauteous objects of our eyes, and the most agreeable\r\ncompanions of our lives. But when I say this, I must not omit at the\r\nsame time to look into their errors and mistakes, that being the\r\nreadiest way to the intended end of adorning and instructing them. It\r\nmust be acknowledged, that the very inadvertencies of this sex are owing\r\nto the other; for if men were not flatterers, women could not fall into\r\nthat general cause of all their follies, and our misfortunes, their love\r\nof flattery. Were the commendation of these agreeable creatures built\r\nupon its proper foundation, the higher we raised their opinion of\r\nthemselves, the greater would be the advantage to our sex; but all the\r\ntopic of praise is drawn from very senseless and extravagant ideas we\r\npretend we have of their beauty and perfection. Thus when a young man\r\nfalls in love with a young woman, from that moment she is no more Mrs.\r\nAlice such-a-one, born of such a father, and educated by such a mother;\r\nbut from the first minute that he casts his eye upon her with desire, he\r\nconceives a doubt in his mind, what heavenly power gave so unexpected a\r\nblow to a heart that was ever before untouched. But who can resist Fate\r\nand Destiny, which are lodged in Mrs. Alice's eyes? After which he\r\ndesires orders accordingly, whether he is to live or breathe; the smile\r\nor frown of his goddess is the only thing that can now either save or\r\ndestroy him. By this means, the well-humoured girl, that would have\r\nromped with him before she received this declaration, assumes a state\r\nsuitable to the majesty he has given her, and treats him as the vassal\r\nhe calls himself. The girl's head is immediately turned by having the\r\npower of life and death, and takes care to suit every motion and air to\r\nher new sovereignty. After he has placed himself at this distance, he\r\nmust never hope to recover his former familiarity, till she has had the\r\naddresses of another, and found them less sincere.\r\n\r\nIf the application to women were justly turned, the address of flattery,\r\nthough it implied at the same time an admonition, would be much more\r\nlikely to succeed. Should a captivated lover, in a billet, let his\r\nmistress know, that her piety to her parents, her gentleness of\r\nbehaviour, her prudent economy with respect to her own little affairs in\r\na virgin condition, had improved the passion which her beauty had\r\ninspired him with, into so settled an esteem for her, that of all women\r\nbreathing he wished her his wife; though his commending her for\r\nqualities she knew she had as a virgin, would make her believe he\r\nexpected from her an answerable conduct in the character of a matron, I\r\nwill answer for it, his suit would be carried on with less perplexity.\r\n\r\nInstead of this, the generality of our young women, taking all their\r\nnotions of life from gay writings, or letters of love, consider\r\nthemselves as goddesses, nymphs, and shepherdesses.\r\n\r\nBy this romantic sense of things, all the natural relations and duties\r\nof life are forgotten, and our female part of mankind are bred and\r\ntreated, as if they were designed to inhabit the happy fields of\r\nArcadia, rather than be wives and mothers in old England. It is indeed\r\nlong since I had the happiness to converse familiarly with this sex, and\r\ntherefore have been fearful of falling into the error which recluse men\r\nare very subject to, that of giving false representations of the world\r\nfrom which they have retired, by imaginary schemes drawn from their own\r\nreflections. An old man cannot easily gain admittance into the\r\ndressing-room of ladies; I therefore thought it time well spent, to turn\r\nover Agrippa, and use all my occult art, to give my old cornelian ring\r\nthe same force with that of Gyges, which I have lately spoken of.[123]\r\nBy the help of this, I went unobserved to a friend's house of mine, and\r\nfollowed the chamber-maid invisibly about twelve of the clock into the\r\nbed-chamber of the beauteous Flavia, his fine daughter, just before she\r\ngot up.\r\n\r\nI drew the curtains, and being wrapped up in the safety of my old age,\r\ncould with much pleasure, without passion, behold her sleeping with\r\nWaller's poems, and a letter fixed in that part of him, where every\r\nwoman thinks herself described. The light flashing upon her face,\r\nawakened her: she opened her eyes, and her lips too, repeating that\r\npiece of false wit in that admired poet:\r\n\r\n    _Such Helen was, and who can blame the boy,\r\n    That in so bright a flame consumed his Troy?_[124]\r\n\r\nThis she pronounced with a most bewitching sweetness; but after it\r\nfetched a sigh, that methought had more desire than languishment, then\r\ntook out her letter, and read aloud, for the pleasure, I suppose, of\r\nhearing soft words in praise of herself, the following epistle:\r\n\r\n     \"MADAM,\r\n\r\n     \"I sat near you at the Opera last night; but knew no entertainment\r\n     from the vain show and noise about me, while I waited wholly intent\r\n     upon the motion of your bright eyes, in hopes of a glance, that\r\n     might restore me to the pleasures of sight and hearing in the midst\r\n     of beauty and harmony. It is said, the hell of the accursed in the\r\n     next life arises from an incapacity to partake the joys of the\r\n     blessed, though they were to be admitted to them. Such I am sure\r\n     was my condition all this evening; and if you, my deity, cannot\r\n     have so much mercy as to make me by your influence capable of\r\n     tasting the satisfactions of life, my being is ended, which\r\n     consisted only in your favour.\"\r\n\r\nThe letter was hardly read over, when she rushed out of bed in her\r\nwrapping-gown, and consulted her glass for the truth of his passion. She\r\nraised her head, and turned it to a profile, repeating the last lines,\r\n\"my being is ended, which consisted only in your favour.\" The goddess\r\nimmediately called her maid, and fell to dressing that mischievous face\r\nof hers, without any manner of consideration for the mortal who had\r\noffered up his petition. Nay, it was so far otherwise, that the whole\r\ntime of her woman's combing her hair was spent in discourse of the\r\nimpertinence of his passion, and ended, in declaring a resolution, if\r\nshe ever had him, to make him wait. She also frankly told the favourite\r\ngipsy that was prating to her, that her passionate lover had put it out\r\nof her power to be civil to him, if she were inclined to it; \"for,\" said\r\nshe, \"if I am thus celestial to my lover, he will certainly so far think\r\nhimself disappointed, as I grow into the familiarity and form of a\r\nmortal woman.\"\r\n\r\nI came away as I went in, without staying for other remarks than what\r\nconfirmed me in the opinion, that it is from the notions the men inspire\r\nthem with, that the women are so fantastical in the value of themselves.\r\nThis imaginary pre-eminence which is given to the fair sex, is not only\r\nformed from the addresses of people of condition; but it is the fashion\r\nand humour of all orders to go regularly out of their wits, as soon as\r\nthey begin to make love. I know at this time three goddesses in the New\r\nExchange;[125] and there are two shepherdesses who sell gloves in\r\nWestminster Hall.[126]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 123: See No. 138.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 124: \"Under a Lady's Picture\" (Waller's Poems: \"Epigrams,\r\nEpitaphs,\" &c.).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 125: See No. 26.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 126: See No. 145.

I am, I\r\nconfess, elevated above that state of mind which is proper for\r\nlucubration: but I am the less concerned at this, because I have for\r\nthis day or two last past observed, that we novelists have been\r\ncondemned wholly to the pastry-cooks, the eyes of the nation being\r\nturned upon greater matters.[127] This therefore being a time when none\r\nbut my immediate correspondents will read me, I shall speak to them\r\nchiefly at this present writing. It is the fate of us who pretend to\r\njoke, to be frequently understood to be only upon the droll when we are\r\nspeaking the most seriously, as appears by the following letter to\r\nCharles Lillie:\r\n\r\n     \"MR. LILLIE,                    \"London, _February 28, 1709/10_.\r\n\r\n     \"It being professed by 'Squire Bickerstaff, that his intention is\r\n     to expose the vices and follies of the age, and to promote virtue\r\n     and goodwill amongst mankind; it must be a comfort, to a person\r\n     labouring under great straits and difficulties, to read anything\r\n     that has the appearance of succour. I should be glad to know\r\n     therefore, whether the intelligence given in his _Tatler_ of\r\n     Saturday last,[128] of the intended charity of a certain citizen of\r\n     London, to maintain the education of ten boys in writing and\r\n     accounts till they be fit for trade, be given only to encourage and\r\n     recommend persons to the practice of such noble and charitable\r\n     designs, or whether there be a person who really intends to do so.\r\n     If the latter, I humbly beg Squire Bickerstaff's pardon for making\r\n     a doubt, and impute it to my ignorance; and most humbly crave, that\r\n     he would be pleased to give notice in his _Tatler_, when he thinks\r\n     fit, whether his nomination of ten boys be disposed of, or whether\r\n     there be room for two boys to be recommended to him; and that he\r\n     will permit the writer of this to present him with two boys, who,\r\n     it is humbly presumed, will be judged to be very remarkable objects\r\n     of such charity.\r\n\r\n                                                  \"Sir,\r\n                                          \"Your most humble Servant.\"\r\n\r\nI am to tell this gentleman in sober sadness, and without jest, that\r\nthere really is so good and charitable a man as the benefactor inquired\r\nfor in his letter, and that there are but two boys yet named. The father\r\nof one of them was killed at Blenheim, the father of the other at\r\nAlmanza. I do not here give the names of the children, because I should\r\ntake it to be an insolence in me to publish them, in a charity which I\r\nhave only the direction of as a servant, to that worthy and generous\r\nspirit who bestows upon them this bounty, without laying the bondage of\r\nan obligation. What I have to do is to tell them, they are beholden only\r\nto their Maker, to kill in them as they grow up the false shame of\r\npoverty, and let them know, that their present fortune, which is come\r\nupon them by the loss of their poor fathers on so glorious occasions, is\r\nmuch more honourable, than the inheritance of the most ample ill-gotten\r\nwealth.\r\n\r\nThe next letter which lies before me is from a man of sense, who\r\nstrengthens his own authority with that of Tully, in persuading me to\r\nwhat he very justly believes one cannot be averse:\r\n\r\n     \"MR. BICKERSTAFF,                      \"London, _Feb. 27, 1709_.\r\n\r\n     \"I am so confident of your inclination to promote anything that is\r\n     for the advancement of liberal arts, that I lay before you the\r\n     following translation of a paragraph in Cicero's oration in defence\r\n     of Archias the poet, as an incentive to the agreeable and\r\n     instructive reading of the writings of the Augustan age. Most vices\r\n     and follies proceed from a man's incapacity of entertaining\r\n     himself, and we are generally fools in company, because we dare not\r\n     be wise alone. I hope, on some future occasions, you will find this\r\n     no barren hint. Tully, after having said very handsome things of\r\n     his client, commends the arts of which he was master as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"'If so much profit be not reaped in the study of letters, and if\r\n     pleasure only be found; yet, in my opinion, this relaxation of the\r\n     mind should be esteemed most humane and ingenuous.

These studies form youth,\r\n     delight old age, adorn prosperity, and soften, and even remove\r\n     adversity, entertain at home, are no hindrance abroad; don't leave\r\n     us at night, and keep us company on the road and in the country.'

He returned it, opening his snuff-box and repeating yet a\r\n     more solemn expression. I beg of you, good Mr. Censor, not to tell\r\n     Pasquin anything of this kind, and to believe this does not come\r\n     from one of a morose temper, mean birth, rigid education, narrow\r\n     fortune, or bigotry in opinion, or from one in whom Time had worn\r\n     out all taste of pleasure.

As\r\nfor my own part, I shall still let the labouring oar be managed by my\r\ncorrespondents, and fill my paper with their sentiments, rather than my\r\nown, till I find my readers more disengaged than they are at\r\npresent.[131] When I came home this evening, I found several letters and\r\npetitions, which I shall insert with no other order, than as I\r\naccidentally opened them, as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"SIR, _March 1, 1709-10._\r\n\r\n     \"Having a daughter about nine years of age, I would endeavour she\r\n     might have education; I mean such as may be useful, as working\r\n     well, and a good deportment. In order to it, I am persuaded to\r\n     place her at some boarding-school, situate in a good air. My wife\r\n     opposes it, and gives for her greatest reason, that she is too much\r\n     a woman, and understands the formalities of visiting and a\r\n     tea-table so very nicely, that none, though much older, can exceed\r\n     her; and with all these perfections, the girl can scarce thread a\r\n     needle: but however, after several arguments, we have agreed to be\r\n     decided by your judgment; and knowing your abilities, shall manage\r\n     our daughter exactly as you shall please to direct. I am serious in\r\n     my request, and hope you will be so in your answer, which will lay\r\n     a deep obligation upon,\r\n\r\n                                                   \"Sir,\r\n                                             \"Your humble Servant,\r\n                                                               \"T.

I have lately said, I\r\ndesign to turn my thoughts more particularly to them and their service:\r\nI beg therefore a little time to give my opinion on so important a\r\nsubject, and desire the young lady may fill tea one week longer, till I\r\nhave considered whether she shall be removed or not.[132]\r\n\r\n                                 \"Chancery Lane, _February 27, 1709_.\r\n     \"MR.

As for their harmony\r\nin the evening, I have nothing to object, provided they remove to\r\nWapping or the Bridge-Foot,[135] where it is not to be supposed that\r\ntheir vociferations will annoy the studious, the busy, or the\r\ncontemplative. I once had lodgings in Gray's Inn, where we had two hard\r\nstudents, who learned to play upon the hautboy; and I had a couple of\r\nchamber fellows over my head not less diligent in the practice of\r\nbacksword and single-rapier. I remember these gentlemen were assigned by\r\nthe benchers the two houses at the end of the Terrace Walk, as the only\r\nplaces fit for their meditations. Such students as will let none improve\r\nbut themselves, ought indeed to have their proper distances from\r\nsocieties.\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen of loud mirth above mentioned I take to be, in the quality\r\nof their crime, the same as eavesdroppers; for they who will be in your\r\ncompany whether you will or no, are to as great a degree offenders, as\r\nthey who hearken to what passes without being of your company at all.\r\nThe ancient punishment for the latter, when I first came to this town,\r\nwas the blanket, which I humbly conceive may be as justly applied to him\r\nthat bawls, as to him that listens. It is therefore provided for the\r\nfuture, that (except in the Long Vacation) no retainers to the law, with\r\ndulcimer, violin, or any other instrument, in any tavern within a\r\nfurlong of an inn of court, shall sing any tune, or pretended tune\r\nwhatsoever, upon pain of the blanket, to be administered according to\r\nthe discretion of all such peaceable people as shall be within the\r\nannoyance. And it is further directed, that all clerks who shall offend\r\nin this kind shall forfeit their indentures, and be turned over as\r\nassistants to the clerks of parishes within the bills of mortality, who\r\nare hereby empowered to demand them accordingly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI am not to omit the receipt of the following letter, with a nightcap,\r\nfrom my valentine;[136] which nightcap I find was finished in the year\r\n1588, and is too finely wrought to be of any modern stitching. Its\r\nantiquity will better appear by my valentine's own words:\r\n\r\n     \"SIR,\r\n\r\n     \"Since you are pleased to accept of so mean a present as a nightcap\r\n     from your valentine, I have sent you one, which I do assure you has\r\n     been very much esteemed of in our family; for my\r\n     great-grandmother's daughter who worked it, was maid of honour to\r\n     Queen Elizabeth, and had the misfortune to lose her life by\r\n     pricking her finger in the making of it, of which she bled to\r\n     death, as her tomb now at Westminster will show: for which reason,\r\n     myself, nor none of my family, have loved work ever since;\r\n     otherwise you should have had one as you desired, made by the hands\r\n     of,\r\n\r\n                                                  \"Sir,\r\n                                              \"Your affectionate\r\n                                                         \"VALENTINE.\"\r\n\r\n     \"_To the Right Worshipful Isaac Bickerstaff, Esq., Censor of Great\r\n     Britain, and Governor of the Hospital erected, or to be erected, in\r\n     Moorfields._\r\n\r\n     \"The petition of the inhabitants of the parish of Goatham in the\r\n     county of Middlesex;\r\n\r\n     \"HUMBLY SHEWETH,\r\n\r\n     \"That whereas 'tis the undoubted right of your said petitioners to\r\n     repair on every Lord's Day to a chapel of ease in the said parish,\r\n     there to be instructed in their duties in the known or vulgar\r\n     tongue; yet so it is (may it please your Worship) that the preacher\r\n     of the said chapel has of late given himself wholly up to matters\r\n     of controversy, in no wise tending to the edification of your said\r\n     petitioners; and in handling (as he calls it) the same, has used\r\n     divers hard and crabbed words; such as, among many others, are\r\n     'orthodox' and 'heterodox,' which are in no sort understood by your\r\n     said petitioners; and it is with grief of heart that your\r\n     petitioners beg leave to represent to you, that in mentioning the\r\n     aforesaid words or names (the latter of which, as we have reason to\r\n     believe, is his deadly enemy), he will fall into ravings and\r\n     foamings, ill-becoming the meekness of his office, and tending to\r\n     give offence and scandal to all good people.\r\n\r\n     \"Your petitioners further say, that they are ready to prove the\r\n     aforesaid allegations; and therefore humbly hope, that from a true\r\n     sense of their condition, you will please to receive the said\r\n     preacher into the hospital, until he shall recover a right use of\r\n     his senses.\r\n\r\n                                          \"And your petitioners,\" &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 131: The whole attention of the town in March 1710 was devoted\r\nto the Sacheverell trial.

This great occasion has given birth to many\r\ndiscoveries of high moment for the conduct of life. There is a toast of\r\nmy acquaintance told me, she had now found out, that it was day before\r\nnine in the morning;[138] and I am very confident, if the affair holds\r\nmany days longer, the ancient hours of eating will be revived among us,\r\nmany having by it been made acquainted with the luxury of hunger and\r\nthirst.\r\n\r\nThere appears, methinks, something very venerable in all assemblies: and\r\nI must confess, I envied all who had youth and health enough to make\r\ntheir appearance there, that they had the happiness of being a whole day\r\nin the best company in the world. During the adjournment of that awful\r\ncourt, a neighbour of mine was telling me, that it gave him a notion of\r\nthe ancient grandeur of the English hospitality, to see Westminster Hall\r\na dining-room.[139] There is a cheerfulness at such repasts, which is\r\nvery delightful to tempers which are so happy as to be clear of spleen\r\nand vapour; for to the jovial to see others pleased, is the greatest of\r\nall pleasures.\r\n\r\nBut since age and infirmities forbid my appearance at such public\r\nplaces, the next happiness is to make the best use of privacy, and\r\nacquit myself of the demands of my correspondents. The following letter\r\nis what has given me no small inquietude, it being an accusation of\r\npartiality, and disregard to merit, in the person of a virtuoso, who is\r\nthe most eloquent of all men upon small occasions, and is the more to be\r\nadmired for his prodigious fertility of invention, which never appears\r\nbut upon subjects which others would have thought barren. But in\r\nconsideration of his uncommon talents, I am contented to let him be the\r\nhero of my next two days, by inserting his friends' recommendation of\r\nhim at large:\r\n\r\n     \"DEAR COUSIN,                    \"Nando's,[140] _Feb. 28, 1709_.\r\n\r\n     \"I am just come out of the country, and upon perusing your late\r\n     Lucubrations, I find Charles Lillie to be the darling of your\r\n     affections, that you have given him a place, and taken no small\r\n     pains to establish him in the world; and at the same time have\r\n     passed by his namesake[141] at this end of the town, as if he was a\r\n     citizen defunct, and one of no use in a commonwealth. I must own,\r\n     his circumstances are so good, and so well known, that he does not\r\n     stand in need of having his fame published to the world; but being\r\n     of an ambitious spirit, and an aspiring soul, he would be rather\r\n     proud of the honour, than desirous of the profit, which might\r\n     result from your recommendation. He is a person of a particular\r\n     genius, the first that brought toys in fashion, and baubles to\r\n     perfection. He is admirably well versed in screws, springs, and\r\n     hinges, and deeply read in knives, combs or scissors, buttons or\r\n     buckles. He is a perfect master of words, which, uttered with a\r\n     smooth voluble tongue, flow into a most persuasive eloquence;\r\n     insomuch that I have known a gentleman of distinction find several\r\n     ingenious faults with a toy of his, and show his utmost dislike to\r\n     it, as being either useless, or ill-contrived; but when the orator\r\n     behind the counter had harangued upon it for an hour and a half,\r\n     displayed its hidden beauties, and revealed its secret\r\n     perfections, he has wondered how he had been able to spend so great\r\n     a part of his life without so important an utensil. I won't pretend\r\n     to furnish out an inventory of all the valuable commodities that\r\n     are to be found at his shop.\r\n\r\n     \"I shall content myself with giving an account of what I think most\r\n     curious. Imprimis, his pocket-books are very neat, and well\r\n     contrived, not for keeping bank bills or goldsmiths' notes,[142] I\r\n     confess; but they are admirable for registering the lodgings of\r\n     Madonnas, and for preserving letters from ladies of quality: his\r\n     whips and spurs are so nice, that they'll make one that buys them\r\n     ride a fox-hunting, though before he hated noise and early rising,\r\n     and was afraid of breaking his neck. His seals are curiously\r\n     fancied, and exquisitely well cut, and of great use to encourage\r\n     young gentlemen to write a good hand. Ned Puzzlepost had been\r\n     ill-used by his writing-master, and writ a sort of a Chinese, or\r\n     downright scrawlian: however, upon his buying a seal of my friend,\r\n     he is so much improved by continual writing, that it is believed in\r\n     a short time one may be able to read his letters, and find out his\r\n     meaning, without guessing. His pistols and fusees are so very good,\r\n     that they are fit to be laid up among the finest china. Then his\r\n     tweezer-cases are incomparable: you shall have one not much bigger\r\n     than your finger, with seventeen several instruments in it, all\r\n     necessary every hour of the day, during the whole course of a man's\r\n     life. But if this virtuoso excels in one thing more than another,\r\n     it is in canes; he has spent his most select hours in the knowledge\r\n     of them, and is arrived at that perfection, that he is able to hold\r\n     forth upon canes longer than upon any one subject in the world.\r\n     Indeed his canes are so finely clouded, and so well made up, either\r\n     with gold or amber heads, that I am of the opinion it is impossible\r\n     for a gentleman to walk, talk, sit or stand as he should do,\r\n     without one of them. He knows the value of a cane, by knowing the\r\n     value of the buyer's estate. Sir Timothy Shallow has two thousand\r\n     pounds per annum, and Tom Empty one. They both at several times\r\n     bought a cane of Charles: Sir Timothy's cost ten guineas, and Tom\r\n     Empty's five. Upon comparing them, they were perfectly alike. Sir\r\n     Timothy surprised there should be no difference in the canes, and\r\n     so much in the price, comes to Charles. 'Damn it, Charles,' says\r\n     he, 'you have sold me a cane here for ten pieces, and the very same\r\n     to Tom Empty for five.' 'Lord, Sir Timothy,' says Charles, 'I am\r\n     concerned that you, whom I took to understand canes better than any\r\n     baronet in town, should be so overseen;[143] why, Sir Timothy,\r\n     yours is a true jambee, and Squire Empty's only a plain\r\n     dragon.'[144]\r\n\r\n     \"This virtuoso has a parcel of jambees now growing in the East\r\n     Indies, where he keeps a man on purpose to look after them, which\r\n     will be the finest that ever landed in Great Britain, and will be\r\n     fit to cut about two years hence. Any gentleman may subscribe for\r\n     as many as he pleases. Subscriptions will be taken in at his shop\r\n     at ten guineas each joint. They that subscribe for six, shall have\r\n     a dragon gratis. This is all I have to say at present concerning\r\n     Charles' curiosities; and hope it may be sufficient to prevail\r\n     with you to take him into your consideration, which if you comply\r\n     with, you will oblige,\r\n\r\n                                                \"Your humble Servant.\r\n\r\n     \"N.B. Whereas there came out last term several gold snuff-boxes and\r\n     others: this is to give notice, that Charles[145] will put out a\r\n     new edition on Saturday next, which will be the only one in fashion\r\n     till after Easter. The gentleman that gave fifty pounds for the box\r\n     set with diamonds, may show it till Sunday night, provided he goes\r\n     to church; but not after that time, there being one to be published\r\n     on Monday which will cost fourscore guineas.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 137: See No. 137.

She had, methought, in her manner and air,\r\nsomething that was a little below that of the women of first breeding\r\nand quality, but at the same time above the simplicity and familiarity\r\nof her usual deportment. As soon as she was seated, she began to talk to\r\nme of the odd place I lived in, and begged of me to remove out of the\r\nlane where I have been so long acquainted; \"for,\" said she, \"it does so\r\nspoil one's horses, that I must beg your pardon if you see me much\r\nseldomer, when I am to make so great a journey with a single pair, and\r\nmake visits and get home the same night.\" I understood her pretty well,\r\nbut would not; therefore desired her to pay off her coach, for I had a\r\ngreat deal to talk to her. She very pertly told me, she came in her own\r\nchariot. \"Why,\" said I, \"is your husband in town? And has he set up an\r\nequipage?\" \"No,\" answered she, \"but I have received £500 by his order;\r\nand his letters, which came at the same time, bade me want for nothing\r\nthat was necessary.\" I was heartily concerned at her folly, whose\r\naffairs render her but just able to bear such an expense. However I\r\nconsidered, that according to the British custom of treating women,\r\nthere is no other method to be used in removing any of their faults and\r\nerrors, but conducting their minds from one humour to another, with as\r\nmuch ceremony as we lead their persons from one place to another. I\r\ntherefore dissembled my concern, and in compliance with her, as a lady\r\nthat was to use her feet no more, I begged of her, after a short visit,\r\nto let me persuade her not to stay out till it was late, for fear of\r\ncatching cold as she went into her coach in the dampness of the evening.\r\nThe Malapert knew well enough I laughed at her, but was not ill-pleased\r\nwith the certainty of her power over her husband, who, she knew, would\r\nsupport her in any humour he was able, rather than pass through the\r\ntorment of an expostulation, to gainsay anything she had a mind to. As\r\nsoon as my fine lady was gone, I writ the following letter to my\r\nbrother:\r\n\r\n     \"DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     \"I am at present under very much concern at the splendid appearance\r\n     I saw my sister make in an equipage which she has set up in your\r\n     absence. I beg of you not to indulge her in this vanity; and desire\r\n     you to consider, the world is so whimsical, that though it will\r\n     value you for being happy, it will hate you for appearing so. The\r\n     possession of wisdom and virtue (the only solid distinctions of\r\n     life) is allowed much more easily than that of wealth and quality.\r\n     Besides which, I must entreat you to weigh with yourself, what it\r\n     is that people aim at in setting themselves out to show in gay\r\n     equipages, and moderate fortunes. You are not by this means a\r\n     better man than your neighbour is; but your horses are better than\r\n     his are. And will you suffer care and inquietude, to have it said\r\n     as you pass by, 'Those are very pretty punch nags!'[146] Nay, when\r\n     you have arrived at this, there are a hundred worthless fellows who\r\n     are still four horses happier than you are. Remember, dear brother,\r\n     there is a certain modesty in the enjoyment of moderate wealth,\r\n     which to transgress, exposes men to the utmost derision; and as\r\n     there is nothing but meanness of spirit can move a man to value\r\n     himself upon what can be purchased with money, so he that shows an\r\n     ambition that way, and cannot arrive at it, is more emphatically\r\n     guilty of that meanness. I give you only my first thoughts on this\r\n     occasion, but shall, as I am a censor, entertain you in my next\r\n     with my sentiments in general upon the subject of equipage; and\r\n     show, that though there are no sumptuary laws amongst us, reason\r\n     and good sense are equally binding, and will ever prevail in\r\n     appointing approbation or dislike in all matters of an indifferent\r\n     nature, when they are pursued with earnestness. I am,\r\n\r\n                                                           \"Sir,\" &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENTS.\r\n\r\nTo all Gentlemen, Ladies, and others, that delight in soft lines.\r\n\r\nThese are to give notice, that the proper time of the year for writing\r\npastorals now drawing near, there is a stage-coach settled from the One\r\nBell in the Strand to Dorchester, which sets out twice a week, and\r\npasses through Basingstoke, Sutton, Stockbridge, Salisbury, Blandford,\r\nand so to Dorchester, over the finest downs in England. At all which\r\nplaces, there are accommodations of spreading beeches, beds of flowers,\r\nturf seats, and purling streams, for happy swains; and thunderstruck\r\noaks, and left-handed ravens, to foretell misfortunes to those that\r\nplease to be wretched; with all other necessaries for pensive passion.\r\n\r\nAnd for the convenience of such whose affairs will not permit them to\r\nleave this town, at the same place they may be furnished, during the\r\nseason, with opening buds, flowering thyme, warbling birds, sporting\r\nlambkins, and fountain water, right and good, and bottled on the spot,\r\nby one sent down on purpose.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nN.B.

It is allowed, that\r\nI have no authority for assuming this important appellation, and that I\r\nam censor of these nations, just as one is chosen king at the game of\r\nquestions and commands:[151] but if, in the execution of this\r\nfantastical dignity, I observe upon things which do not fall within the\r\ncognisance of real authority, I hope it will be granted, that an idle\r\nman could not be more usefully employed. Among all the irregularities of\r\nwhich I have taken notice, I know none so proper to be presented to the\r\nworld by a censor, as that of the general expense and affectation in\r\nequipage. I have lately hinted, that this extravagance must necessarily\r\nget footing where we have no sumptuary laws, and where every man may be\r\ndressed, attended, and carried, in what manner he pleases. But my\r\ntenderness to my fellow subjects will not permit me to let this enormity\r\ngo unobserved.\r\n\r\nAs the matter now stands, every man takes it in his head, that he has a\r\nliberty to spend his money as he pleases. Thus, in spite of all order,\r\njustice, and decorum, we the greater number of the Queen's loyal\r\nsubjects, for no reason in the world but because we want money, do not\r\nshare alike in the division of her Majesty's high-road. The horses and\r\nslaves of the rich take up the whole street, while we peripatetics are\r\nvery glad to watch an opportunity to whisk across a passage, very\r\nthankful that we are not run over for interrupting the machine, that\r\ncarries in it a person neither more handsome, wise, nor valiant than the\r\nmeanest of us. For this reason, were I to propose a tax, it should\r\ncertainly be upon coaches and chairs: for no man living can assign a\r\nreason why one man should have half a street to carry him at his ease,\r\nand perhaps only in pursuit of pleasures, when as good a man as himself\r\nwants room for his own person to pass upon the most necessary and urgent\r\noccasion. Till such an acknowledgment is made to the public, I shall\r\ntake upon me to vest certain rights in the scavengers of the cities of\r\nLondon and Westminster, to take the horses and servants of all such as\r\ndo not become or deserve such distinctions into their peculiar custody.\r\nThe offenders themselves I shall allow safe conduct to their places of\r\nabode in the carts of the said scavengers, but their horses shall be\r\nmounted by their footmen, and sent into the service abroad: and I take\r\nthis opportunity in the first place to recruit the regiment of my good\r\nold friend the brave and honest Sylvius,[152] that they be as well\r\ntaught as they are fed. It is to me most miraculous, so unreasonable an\r\nusurpation as this I am speaking of should so long have been tolerated.\r\nWe hang a poor fellow for taking any trifle from us on the road, and\r\nbear with the rich for robbing us of the road itself. Such a tax as this\r\nwould be of great satisfaction to us who walk on foot; and since the\r\ndistinction of riding in a coach is not to be appointed according to a\r\nman's merit or service to their country, nor that liberty given as a\r\nreward for some eminent virtue, we should be highly contented to see\r\nthem pay something for the insult they do us in the state they take upon\r\nthem while they are drawn by us.\r\n\r\nTill they have made us some reparation of this kind, we the peripatetics\r\nof Great Britain cannot think ourselves well treated, while every one\r\nthat is able is allowed to set up an equipage.\r\n\r\nAs for my part, I cannot but admire how persons, conscious to themselves\r\nof no manner of superiority above others, can out of mere pride or\r\nlaziness expose themselves at this rate to public view, and put us all\r\nupon pronouncing those three terrible syllables, Who is that? When it\r\ncomes to that question, our method is to consider the mien and air of\r\nthe passenger, and comfort ourselves for being dirty to the ankles, by\r\nlaughing at his figure and appearance who overlooks us. I must confess,\r\nwere it not for the solid injustice of the thing, there is nothing could\r\nafford a discerning eye greater occasion for mirth, than this licentious\r\nhuddle of qualities and characters in the equipages about this town. The\r\noverseers of the highway and constables have so little skill or power to\r\nrectify this matter, that you may often see the equipage of a fellow\r\nwhom all the town knows to deserve hanging, make a stop that shall\r\ninterrupt the Lord High Chancellor and all the judges on their way to\r\nWestminster.\r\n\r\nFor the better understanding of things and persons in this general\r\nconfusion, I have given directions to all the coachmakers and\r\ncoach-painters in town, to bring me in lists of their several customers;\r\nand doubt not, but with comparing the orders of each man, in the placing\r\nhis arms on the doors of his chariot, as well as the words, devices and\r\nciphers to be fixed upon them, to make a collection which shall let us\r\ninto the nature, if not the history, of mankind, more usefully than the\r\ncuriosities of any medallist in Europe.\r\n\r\nBut this evil of vanity in our figure, with many, many others, proceeds\r\nfrom a certain gaiety of heart, which has crept into men's very thoughts\r\nand complexions. The passions and adventures of heroes, when they enter\r\nthe lists for the tournament in romances, are not more easily\r\ndistinguishable by their palfreys and their armour, than the secret\r\nsprings and affections of the several pretenders to show amongst us are\r\nknown by their equipages in ordinary life. The young bridegroom with his\r\ngilded cupids, and winged angels, has some excuse in the joy of his\r\nheart to launch out into something that may be significant of his\r\npresent happiness: but to see men, for no reason upon earth but that\r\nthey are rich, ascend triumphant chariots, and ride through the people,\r\nhas at the bottom nothing else in it but an insolent transport, arising\r\nonly from the distinction of fortune.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore high time that I call in such coaches as are in their\r\nembellishments improper for the character of their owners. But if I find\r\nI am not obeyed herein, and that I cannot pull down these equipages\r\nalready erected, I shall take upon me to prevent the growth of this evil\r\nfor the future, by inquiring into the pretensions of the persons who\r\nshall hereafter attempt to make public entries with ornaments and\r\ndecorations of his own appointment. If a man, who believed he had the\r\nhandsomest leg in this kingdom, should take a fancy to adorn so\r\ndeserving a limb with a blue garter, he would justly be punished for\r\noffending against the most noble order: and, I think, the general\r\nprostitution of equipage and retinue is as destructive to all\r\ndistinction, as the impertinence of one man, if permitted, would\r\ncertainly be to that illustrious fraternity.\r\n\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT.\r\n\r\nThe Censor having lately received intelligence, that the ancient\r\nsimplicity in the dress and manners of that part of this island, called\r\nScotland, begins to decay; and that there are at this time in the good\r\ntown of Edinburgh, beaus, fops, and coxcombs: his late correspondent[153]\r\nfrom that place is desired to send up their names and characters with\r\nall expedition, that they may be proceeded against accordingly, and\r\nproper officers named to take in their canes, snuff-boxes, and all other\r\nuseless necessaries commonly worn by such offenders.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 151: Cf.

Seth Wood, was\r\nborn in 1636. He served for four years as a private soldier, before he\r\nwas advanced to be a sub-brigadier; after which his rise was rapid,\r\nowing entirely to his signal valour, his strict justice, and extensive\r\nhumanity. The Prince of Orange, on his accession to the throne, gave him\r\na troop of horse, in the regiment commanded by George Lord Huet; he was\r\nmade a colonel of horse in 1693; and a brigadier-general in 1702. His\r\nconduct and conversation in Ireland rendered him very acceptable to\r\nMarshal Schomberg; his valour was conspicuous at the Battle of Blenheim,\r\nafter which the Duke of Marlborough declared him a major-general; it was\r\nno less signally manifested at Ramillies in 1706; the year following he\r\nwas made a lieutenant-general of horse, in which post he arrived to be\r\nthe eldest. In 1708, he was Governor of Ghent, and honoured by the\r\nburghers, in testimony of their singular satisfaction, with a large\r\npiece of plate, which he left as a legacy to the Duke of Ormond, to\r\nevince his gratitude for services received, and his esteem for that\r\nnobleman's illustrious character. In 1709, he gathered fresh laurels in\r\nthe bloody field of Tanieres, and next year was again appointed Governor\r\nof Ghent; but in his march to that garrison, an unruly horse on which he\r\nrode, reared on end, and fell backwards upon him; his collar-bone was\r\nbroken, and his stomach so bruised by this accident, that he never was\r\nwell after. He languished about two years, and died at the Gravel-pits\r\nnear Kensington, on the 17th of May 1712, in the 75th year of his age.\r\nHe never married (Nichols).

These\r\nare, it seems, gentlemen who look with deep attention on one object at\r\nthe playhouses, and are ever staring all round them in churches. It is\r\nurged by my correspondents, that they do all that is possible to keep\r\ntheir eyes off these ensnarers; but that, by what power they know not,\r\nboth their diversions and devotions are interrupted by them in such a\r\nmanner, as that they cannot attend either without stealing looks at the\r\npersons whose eyes are fixed upon them. By this means, my petitioners\r\nsay, they find themselves grow insensibly less offended, and in time\r\nenamoured, of these their enemies. What is required of me on this\r\noccasion, is, that as I love and study to preserve the better part of\r\nmankind, the females, I would give them some account of this dangerous\r\nway of assault, against which there is so little defence, that it lays\r\nambush for the sight itself, and makes them seeingly, knowingly,\r\nwillingly, and forcibly go on to their own captivity.\r\n\r\nThis representation of the present state of affairs between the two\r\nsexes gave me very much alarm; and I had no more to do, but to recollect\r\nwhat I had seen at any one assembly for some years last past, to be\r\nconvinced of the truth and justice of this remonstrance. If there be not\r\na stop put to this evil art, all the modes of address, and the elegant\r\nembellishments of life, which arise out of the noble passion of love,\r\nwill of necessity decay. Who would be at the trouble of rhetoric, or\r\nstudy the _bon mien_, when his introduction is so much easier obtained\r\nby a sudden reverence in a downcast look at the meeting the eye of a\r\nfair lady, and beginning again to ogle her as soon as she glances\r\nanother way? I remember very well, when I was last at an opera, I could\r\nperceive the eyes of the whole audience cast into particular cross\r\nangles one upon another, without any manner of regard to the stage,\r\nthough King Latinus was himself present when I made that observation. It\r\nwas then very pleasant to look into the hearts of the whole company; for\r\nthe balls of sight are so formed, that one man's eyes are spectacles to\r\nanother to read his heart with. The most ordinary beholder can take\r\nnotice of any violent agitation in the mind, any pleasing transport, or\r\nany inward grief, in the person he looks at; but one of these oglers can\r\nsee a studied indifference, a concealed love, or a smothered resentment,\r\nin the very glances that are made to hide those dispositions of thought.\r\nThe naturalists tell us, that the rattlesnake will fix himself under a\r\ntree where he sees a squirrel playing; and when he has once got the\r\nexchange of a glance from the pretty wanton, will give it such a sudden\r\nstroke on its imagination, that though it may play from bough to bough,\r\nand strive to avert its eyes from it for some time, yet it comes nearer\r\nand nearer by little intervals of looking another way, till it drops\r\ninto the jaws of the animal, which it knew gazed at it for no other\r\nreason but to ruin it. I did not believe this piece of philosophy till\r\nthat night I was just now speaking of; but I then saw the same thing\r\npass between an ogler and a coquette. Mirtillo, the most learned of the\r\nformer, had for some time discontinued to visit Flavia, no less eminent\r\namong the latter. They industriously avoided all places where they might\r\nprobably meet, but chance brought them together to the playhouse, and\r\nseated them in a direct line over against each other, she in a front\r\nbox, he in the pit next the stage. As soon as Flavia had received the\r\nlooks of the whole crowd below her with that air of insensibility which\r\nis necessary at the first entrance, she began to look round her and saw\r\nthe vagabond Mirtillo, who had so long absented himself from her circle;\r\nand when she first discovered him, she looked upon him with that glance,\r\nwhich, in the language of oglers, is called the scornful, but\r\nimmediately turned her observation another way, and returned upon him\r\nwith the indifferent. This gave Mirtillo no small resentment; but he\r\nused her accordingly. He took care to be ready for her next glance. She\r\nfound his eyes full in the indolent, with his lips crumpled up in the\r\nposture of one whistling. Her anger at this usage immediately appeared\r\nin every muscle of her face; and after many emotions, which glistened in\r\nher eyes, she cast them round the whole house, and gave them softnesses\r\nin the face of every man she had ever seen before. After she thought she\r\nhad reduced all she saw to her obedience, the play began, and ended\r\ntheir dialogue. As soon as that was over, she stood up with a visage\r\nfull of dissembled alacrity and pleasure, with which she overlooked the\r\naudience, and at last came to him: he was then placed in a side-way,\r\nwith his hat slouching over his eyes, and gazing at a wench in the\r\nside-box,[155] as talking of that gipsy to the gentleman who sat by him.\r\nBut as she was fixed upon him, he turned suddenly with a full face upon\r\nher, and with all the respect imaginable, made her the most obsequious\r\nbow in the presence of the whole theatre. This gave her a pleasure not\r\nto be concealed, and she made him the recovering or second curtsy, with\r\na smile that spoke a perfect reconciliation. Between the ensuing acts,\r\nthey talked to each other with gestures and glances so significant, that\r\nthey ridiculed the whole house in this silent speech, and made an\r\nappointment that Mirtillo should lead her to her coach.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar language of one eye, as it differs from another, as much as\r\nthe tone of one voice from another, and the fascination or enchantment\r\nwhich is lodged in the optic nerves of the persons concerned in these\r\ndialogues, is, I must confess, too nice a subject for one who is not an\r\nadept in these speculations; but I shall, for the good and safety of the\r\nfair sex, call my learned friend Sir William Read[156] to my assistance,\r\nand, by the help of his observations on this organ, acquaint them when\r\nthe eye is to be believed, and when distrusted. On the contrary, I shall\r\nconceal the true meaning of the looks of ladies, and indulge in them all\r\nthe art they can acquire in the management of their glances: all which\r\nis but too little against creatures who triumph in falsehood, and begin\r\nto forswear with their eyes, when their tongues can be no longer\r\nbelieved.\r\n\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT.\r\n\r\nA very clean, well-behaved young gentleman, who is in a very good way in\r\nCornhill, has writ to me the following lines, and seems in some passages\r\nof his letter (which I omit) to lay it very much to heart, that I have\r\nnot spoken of a supernatural beauty whom he sighs for, and complains to\r\nin most elaborate language.

One of them dates his letter to me from the banks\r\nof a purling stream, where he used to ruminate in solitude upon the\r\ndivine Clarissa, and where he is now looking about for a convenient\r\nleap, which he tells me he is resolved to take, unless I support him\r\nunder the loss of that charming perjured woman. Poor Lavinia presses as\r\nmuch for consolation on the other side, and is reduced to such an\r\nextremity of despair by the inconstancy of Philander, that she tells me\r\nshe writes her letter with her pen in one hand and her garter in the\r\nother. A gentleman of an ancient family in Norfolk is almost out of his\r\nwits upon account of a greyhound, that after having been his inseparable\r\ncompanion for ten years, is at last run mad. Another (who I believe is\r\nserious) complains to me, in a very moving manner, of the loss of a\r\nwife; and another, in terms still more moving, of a purse of money that\r\nwas taken from him on Bagshot Heath, and which, he tells me, would not\r\nhave troubled him if he had given it to the poor. In short, there is\r\nscarce a calamity in human life that has not produced me a letter.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed wonderful to consider, how men are able to raise affliction\r\nto themselves out of everything. Lands and houses, sheep and oxen, can\r\nconvey happiness and misery into the hearts of reasonable creatures.\r\nNay, I have known a muff, a scarf, or a tippet, become a solid blessing\r\nor misfortune. A lap-dog has broke the hearts of thousands. Flavia, who\r\nhad buried five children, and two husbands, was never able to get over\r\nthe loss of her parrot. How often has a divine creature been thrown into\r\na fit by a neglect at a ball or an assembly? Mopsa has kept her chamber\r\never since the last masquerade, and is in greater danger of her life\r\nupon being left out of it, than Clarinda from the violent cold which she\r\ncaught at it. Nor are these dear creatures the only sufferers by such\r\nimaginary calamities: many an author has been dejected at the censure of\r\none whom he ever looked upon as an idiot; and many a hero cast into a\r\nfit of melancholy, because the rabble have not hooted at him as he\r\npassed through the streets. Theron places all his happiness in a running\r\nhorse, Suffenus in a gilded chariot, Fulvius in a blue string, and\r\nFlorio in a tulip root. It would be endless to enumerate the many\r\nfantastical afflictions that disturb mankind; but as a misery is not to\r\nbe measured from the nature of the evil, but from the temper of the\r\nsufferer, I shall present my readers, who are unhappy either in reality\r\nor imagination, with an allegory, for which I am indebted to the great\r\nfather and prince of poets.\r\n\r\nAs I was sitting after dinner in my elbow-chair, I took up Homer, and\r\ndipped into that famous speech of Achilles to Priam, in which he tells\r\nhim, that Jupiter has by him two great vessels, the one filled with\r\nblessings, and the other with misfortunes; out of which he mingles a\r\ncomposition for every man that comes into the world. This passage so\r\nexceedingly pleased me, that as I fell insensibly into my afternoon's\r\nslumber, it wrought my imagination into the following dream:\r\n\r\nWhen Jupiter took into his hands the government of the world, the\r\nseveral parts of nature, with their presiding deities, did homage to\r\nhim. One presented him with a mountain of winds, another with a magazine\r\nof hail, and a third with a pile of thunderbolts. The stars offered up\r\ntheir influences; the ocean gave in his trident, the earth her fruits,\r\nand the sun his seasons. Among the several deities who came to make\r\ntheir court on this occasion, the destinies advanced with two great tuns\r\ncarried before them, one of which they fixed at the right hand of\r\nJupiter as he sat upon his throne, and the other on his left. The first\r\nwas filled with all the blessings, and the other with all the calamities\r\nof human life. Jupiter, in the beginning of his reign, finding the world\r\nmuch more innocent than it is in this iron age, poured very plentifully\r\nout of the tun that stood at his right hand; but as mankind degenerated,\r\nand became unworthy of his blessings, he set abroach the other vessel,\r\nthat filled the world with pain and poverty, battles and distempers,\r\njealousy and falsehood, intoxicating pleasures and untimely deaths.\r\n\r\nHe was at length so very much incensed at the great depravation of human\r\nnature, and the repeated provocations which he received from all parts\r\nof the earth, that having resolved to destroy the whole species, except\r\nDeucalion and Pyrrha, he commanded the Destinies to gather up the\r\nblessings which he had thrown away upon the sons of men, and lay them up\r\ntill the world should be inhabited by a more virtuous and deserving race\r\nof mortals.\r\n\r\nThe three sisters immediately repaired to the earth, in search of the\r\nseveral blessings that had been scattered on it; but found the task\r\nwhich was enjoined them, to be much more difficult than they had\r\nimagined. The first places they resorted to, as the most likely to\r\nsucceed in, were cities, palaces, and courts; but instead of meeting\r\nwith what they looked for here, they found nothing but envy, repining,\r\nuneasiness, and the like bitter ingredients of the left-hand vessel.\r\nWhereas, to their great surprise, they discovered content, cheerfulness,\r\nhealth, innocence, and other the most substantial blessings of life, in\r\ncottages, shades, and solitudes.\r\n\r\nThere was another circumstance no less unexpected than the former, and\r\nwhich gave them very great perplexity in the discharge of the trust\r\nwhich Jupiter had committed to them. They observed, that several\r\nblessings had degenerated into calamities, and that several calamities\r\nhad improved into blessings, according as they fell into the possession\r\nof wise or foolish men. They often found power, with so much insolence\r\nand impatience cleaving to it, that it became a misfortune to the person\r\non whom it was conferred. Youth had often distempers growing about it,\r\nworse than the infirmities of old age: wealth was often united to such a\r\nsordid avarice, as made it the most uncomfortable and painful kind of\r\npoverty. On the contrary, they often found pain made glorious by\r\nfortitude, poverty lost in content, deformity beautified with virtue. In\r\na word, the blessings were often like good fruits planted in a bad\r\nsoil, that by degrees fall off from their natural relish, into tastes\r\naltogether insipid or unwholesome; and the calamities, like harsh\r\nfruits, cultivated in a good soil, and enriched by proper grafts and\r\ninoculations, till they swell with generous and delightful juices.\r\n\r\nThere was still a third circumstance that occasioned as great a surprise\r\nto the three sisters as either of the foregoing, when they discovered\r\nseveral blessings and calamities which had never been in either of the\r\ntuns that stood by the throne of Jupiter, and were nevertheless as great\r\noccasions of happiness or misery as any there. These were that spurious\r\ncrop of blessings and calamities which were never sown by the hand of\r\nthe Deity, but grow of themselves out of the fancies and dispositions of\r\nhuman creatures. Such are dress, titles, place, equipage, false shame,\r\nand groundless fear, with the like vain imaginations that shoot up in\r\ntrifling, weak, and irresolute minds.\r\n\r\nThe Destinies finding themselves in so great a perplexity, concluded,\r\nthat it would be impossible for them to execute the commands that had\r\nbeen given them according to their first intention; for which reason\r\nthey agreed to throw all the blessings and calamities together into one\r\nlarge vessel, and in that manner offer them up at the feet of Jupiter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis was performed accordingly, the eldest sister presenting herself\r\nbefore the vessel, and introducing it with an apology for what they had\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"O Jupiter!\" says she, \"we have gathered together all the good and evil,\r\nthe comforts and distresses of human life, which we thus present before\r\nthee in one promiscuous heap. We beseech thee that thou thyself wilt\r\nsort them out for the future, as in thy wisdom thou shalt think fit. For\r\nwe acknowledge, that there is none beside thee that can judge what will\r\noccasion grief or joy in the heart of a human creature, and what will\r\nprove a blessing or a calamity to the person on whom it is bestowed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 147.                                         [ADDISON AND STEELE.\r\n\r\nFrom _Thurs., March 16_, to _Satur., March 18, 1709-10_.\r\n\r\n    ----Ut ameris, amabilis esto.--OVID., Ars Am. ii. 107.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, March 17._\r\n\r\nReading is to the mind what exercise is to the body. As by the one,\r\nhealth is preserved, strengthened and invigorated; by the other, virtue\r\n(which is the health of the mind) is kept alive, cherished and\r\nconfirmed. But as exercise becomes tedious and painful when we make use\r\nof it only as the means of health, so reading is apt to grow uneasy and\r\nburdensome, when we apply ourselves to it only for our improvement in\r\nvirtue. For this reason, the virtue which we gather from a fable, or an\r\nallegory, is like the health we get by hunting; as we are engaged in an\r\nagreeable pursuit that draws us on with pleasure, and makes us\r\ninsensible of the fatigues that accompany it.\r\n\r\nAfter this preface, I shall set down a very beautiful allegorical fable\r\nout of the great poet whom I mentioned in my last paper, and whom it is\r\nvery difficult to lay aside when one is engaged in the reading of him.\r\nAnd this I particularly design for the use of several of my fair\r\ncorrespondents, who in their letters have complained to me, that they\r\nhave lost the affections of their husbands, and desire my advice how to\r\nrecover them.\r\n\r\nJuno, says Homer,[159] seeing her Jupiter seated on the top of Mount\r\nIda, and knowing that he had conceived an aversion to her, began to\r\nstudy how she should regain his affections, and make herself amiable to\r\nhim. With this thought she immediately retired into her chamber, where\r\nshe bathed herself in ambrosia, which gave her person all its beauty,\r\nand diffused so divine an odour, as refreshed all nature, and sweetened\r\nboth heaven and earth. She let her immortal tresses flow in the most\r\ngraceful manner, and took a particular care to dress herself in several\r\nornaments, which the poet describes at length, and which the goddess\r\nchose out as the most proper to set off her person to the best\r\nadvantage. In the next place, she made a visit to Venus, the deity who\r\npresides over love, and begged of her, as a particular favour, that she\r\nwould lend her for a while those charms with which she subdued the\r\nhearts both of gods and men. \"For,\" says the goddess, \"I would make use\r\nof them to reconcile the two deities who took care of me in my infancy,\r\nand who, at present, are at so great a variance, that they are estranged\r\nfrom each other's bed.\" Venus was proud of an opportunity of obliging so\r\ngreat a goddess, and therefore made her a present of the cestus which\r\nshe used to wear about her own waist, with advice to hide it in her\r\nbosom till she had accomplished her intention. This cestus was a fine\r\nparti-coloured girdle, which, as Homer tells us, had all the attractions\r\nof the sex wrought into it. The four principal figures in the embroidery\r\nwere Love, Desire, Fondness of Speech, and Conversation, filled with\r\nthat sweetness and complacency, which, says the poet, insensibly steal\r\naway the hearts of the wisest men.\r\n\r\nJuno, after having made these necessary preparations, came as by\r\naccident into the presence of Jupiter, who is said to have been as much\r\ninflamed with her beauty, as when he first stole to her embraces without\r\nthe consent of their parents. Juno, to cover her real thoughts, told\r\nhim as she had told Venus, that she was going to make a visit to\r\nOceanus and Tethys. He prevailed upon her to stay with him, protesting\r\nto her, that she appeared more amiable in his eye than ever any mortal,\r\ngoddess, or even herself, had appeared to him till that day. The poet\r\nthen represents him in so great an ardour, that (without going up to the\r\nhouse which had been built by the hands of Vulcan according to Juno's\r\ndirection) he threw a golden cloud over their heads as they sat upon the\r\ntop of Mount Ida, while the earth beneath them sprung up in\r\nlotuses,[160] saffrons, hyacinths, and a bed of the softest flowers for\r\ntheir repose.\r\n\r\nThis close translation of one of the finest passages in Homer, may\r\nsuggest abundance of instruction to a woman who has a mind to preserve\r\nor recall the affection of her husband. The care of the person and the\r\ndress, with the particular blandishments woven in the cestus, are so\r\nplainly recommended by this fable, and so indispensably necessary in\r\nevery female who desires to please, that they need no further\r\nexplanation. The discretion likewise in covering all matrimonial\r\nquarrels from the knowledge of others, is taught in the pretended visit\r\nto Tethys, in the speech where Juno addresses herself to Venus; as the\r\nchaste and prudent management of a wife's charms is intimated by the\r\nsame pretence for her appearing before Jupiter, and by the concealment\r\nof the cestus in her bosom.\r\n\r\nI shall leave this tale to the consideration of such good housewives who\r\nare never well dressed but when they are abroad, and think it necessary\r\nto appear more agreeable to all men living than their husbands: as also\r\nto those prudent ladies, who, to avoid the appearance of being\r\noverfond, entertain their husband with indifference, aversion, sullen\r\nsilence, or exasperating language.[161]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sheer Lane, March 17._\r\n\r\nUpon my coming home last night, I found a very handsome present of wine\r\nleft for me, as a taste of 216 hogsheads which are to be put to sale at\r\n£20 a hogshead, at Garraway's Coffee-house in Exchange Alley, on the\r\n22nd instant, at three in the afternoon, and to be tasted in Major\r\nLong's vaults from the 20th instant till the time of sale.[162] This\r\nhaving been sent to me with a desire that I would give my judgment upon\r\nit, I immediately impanelled a jury of men of nice palates and strong\r\nheads, who being all of them very scrupulous, and unwilling to proceed\r\nrashly in a matter of so great importance, refused to bring in their\r\nverdict till three in the morning; at which time the foreman pronounced,\r\nas well as he was able, \"Extra--a--ordinary French claret.\" For my own\r\npart, as I love to consult my pillow in all points of moment, I slept\r\nupon it before I would give my sentence, and this morning confirmed the\r\nverdict.\r\n\r\nHaving mentioned this tribute of wine, I must give notice to my\r\ncorrespondents for the future, who shall apply to me on this occasion,\r\nthat as I shall decide nothing unadvisedly in matters of this nature, I\r\ncannot pretend to give judgment of a right good liquor, without\r\nexamining at least three dozen bottles of it. I must at the same time do\r\nmyself the justice to let the world know, that I have resisted great\r\ntemptations in this kind; as it is well known to a butcher in Clare\r\nMarket, who endeavoured to corrupt me with a dozen and a half of\r\nmarrow-bones. I had likewise a bribe sent me by a fishmonger, consisting\r\nof a collar of brawn, and a joll of salmon; but not finding them\r\nexcellent in their kinds, I had the integrity to eat them both up,\r\nwithout speaking one word of them. However, for the future, I shall have\r\nan eye to the diet of this great city, and will recommend the best and\r\nmost wholesome food to them, if I receive these proper and respectful\r\nnotices from the sellers, that it may not be said hereafter, my readers\r\nwere better taught than fed.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 159: \"Iliad,\" xiv. 157.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 160: Lotus is the name of a native genus akin to the trefoil\r\nand clovers.

This was the diet which bred that hardy\r\nrace of mortals who won the fields of Cressy and Agincourt. I need not\r\ngo up so high as the history of Guy Earl of Warwick, who is well known\r\nto have eaten up a dun cow of his own killing.[163] The renowned King\r\nArthur is generally looked upon as the first who ever sat down to a\r\nwhole roasted ox (which was certainly the best way to preserve the\r\ngravy), and it is further added, that he and his knights sat about it at\r\nhis Round Table, and usually consumed it to the very bones before they\r\nwould enter upon any debate of moment. The Black Prince was a professed\r\nlover of the brisket; not to mention the history of the sirloin, or the\r\ninstitution of the Order of Beef-eaters, which are all so many evident\r\nand undeniable marks of the great respect which our warlike predecessors\r\nhave paid to this excellent food. The tables of the ancient gentry of\r\nthis nation were covered thrice a day with hot roast beef; and I am\r\ncredibly informed, by an antiquary who has searched the registers in\r\nwhich the bills of fare of the Court are recorded, that instead of tea\r\nand bread and butter, which have prevailed of late years, the maids of\r\nhonour in Queen Elizabeth's time were allowed three rumps of beef for\r\ntheir breakfast. Mutton has likewise been in great repute among our\r\nvaliant countrymen, but was formerly observed to be the food rather of\r\nmen of nice and delicate appetites, than those of strong and robust\r\nconstitutions. For which reason, even to this day, we use the word\r\n\"sheep-biter\" as a term of reproach, as we do \"beef-eater\" in a\r\nrespectful and honourable sense. As for the flesh of lamb, veal,\r\nchicken, and other animals under age, they were the invention of sickly\r\nand degenerate palates, according to that wholesome remark of Daniel the\r\nhistorian,[164] who takes notice, that in all taxes upon provisions,\r\nduring the reigns of several of our kings, there is nothing mentioned\r\nbesides the flesh of such fowl and cattle as were arrived at their full\r\ngrowth, and were mature for slaughter. The common people of this kingdom\r\ndo still keep up the taste of their ancestors; and it is to this that we\r\nin a great measure owe the unparalleled victories that have been gained\r\nin this reign: for, I would desire my reader to consider, what work our\r\ncountrymen would have made at Blenheim and Ramillies, if they had been\r\nfed with fricassees and ragouts.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, we at present see the florid complexion, the strong\r\nlimb, and the hale constitution, are to be found chiefly among the\r\nmeaner sort of people, or in the wild gentry, who have been educated\r\namong the woods or mountains. Whereas many great families are insensibly\r\nfallen off from the athletic constitution of their progenitors, and are\r\ndwindled away into a pale, sickly, spindle-legged, generation of\r\nvaletudinarians.\r\n\r\nI may perhaps be thought extravagant in my notion; but I must confess, I\r\nam apt to impute the dishonours that sometimes happen in great families\r\nto the inflaming kind of diet which is so much in fashion. Many dishes\r\ncan excite desire without giving strength, and heat the body without\r\nnourishing it; as physicians observe, that the poorest and most\r\ndispirited blood is most subject to fevers. I look upon a French ragout\r\nto be as pernicious to the stomach as a glass of spirits; and when I\r\nhave seen a young lady swallow all the instigations of high soups,\r\nseasoned sauces, and forced meats, I have wondered at the despair or\r\ntedious sighing of her lovers.\r\n\r\nThe rules among these false delicates are to be as contradictory as they\r\ncan be to nature.\r\n\r\nWithout expecting the return of hunger, they eat for an appetite, and\r\nprepare dishes not to allay, but to excite it.\r\n\r\nThey admit of nothing at their tables, in its natural form, or without\r\nsome disguise.\r\n\r\nThey are to eat everything before it comes in season, and to leave it\r\noff as soon as it is good to be eaten.\r\n\r\nThey are not to approve anything that is agreeable to ordinary palates;\r\nand nothing is to gratify their senses, but what would offend those of\r\ntheir inferiors.\r\n\r\nI remember I was last summer invited to a friend's house, who is a great\r\nadmirer of the French cookery, and (as the phrase is) eats well. At our\r\nsitting down, I found the table covered with a great variety of unknown\r\ndishes. I was mightily at a loss to learn what they were, and therefore\r\ndid not know where to help myself. That which stood before me, I took to\r\nbe a roasted porcupine, however did not care for asking questions; and\r\nhave since been informed, that it was only a larded turkey. I afterwards\r\npassed my eye over several hashes, which I do not know the names of to\r\nthis day; and hearing that they were delicacies, did not think fit to\r\nmeddle with them.\r\n\r\nAmong other dainties, I saw something like a pheasant, and therefore\r\ndesired to be helped to a wing of it; but to my great surprise, my\r\nfriend told me it was a rabbit, which is a sort of meat I never cared\r\nfor. At last I discovered, with some joy, a pig at the lower end of the\r\ntable, and begged a gentleman that was near it to cut me a piece of it.\r\nUpon which the gentleman of the house said, with great civility, \"I am\r\nsure you will like the pig, for it was whipped to death.\" I must\r\nconfess, I heard him with horror, and could not eat of an animal that\r\nhad died so tragical a death. I was now in great hunger and confusion,\r\nwhen, methought, I smelt the agreeable savour of roast beef, but could\r\nnot tell from which dish it arose, though I did not question but it lay\r\ndisguised in one of them. Upon turning my head, I saw a noble sirloin on\r\nthe side-table smoking in the most delicious manner. I had recourse to\r\nit more than once, and could not see, without some indignation, that\r\nsubstantial English dish banished in so ignominious a manner, to make\r\nway for French kickshaws.\r\n\r\nThe dessert was brought up at last, which in truth was as extraordinary\r\nas anything that had come before it. The whole, when ranged in its\r\nproper order, looked like a very beautiful winter-piece. There were\r\nseveral pyramids of candied sweetmeats, that hung like icicles, with\r\nfruit scattered up and down, and hid in an artificial kind of frost. At\r\nthe same time there were great quantities of cream beaten up into a\r\nsnow, and near them little plates of sugar-plums, disposed like so many\r\nheaps of hailstones, with a multitude of congelations in jellies of\r\nvarious colours. I was indeed so pleased with the several objects which\r\nlay before me, that I did not care for displacing any of them, and was\r\nhalf angry with the rest of the company, that for the sake of a piece of\r\nlemon-peel, or a sugar-plum, would spoil so pleasing a picture. Indeed,\r\nI could not but smile to see several of them cooling their mouths with\r\nlumps of ice which they had just before been burning with salts and\r\npeppers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs soon as this show was over I took my leave, that I might finish my\r\ndinner at my own house: for as I in every thing love what is simple and\r\nnatural, so particularly in my food; two plain dishes, with two or three\r\ngood-natured, cheerful, ingenious friends, would make me more pleased\r\nand vain, than all that pomp and luxury can bestow.

These cruel men are ill-natured husbands. The commerce in\r\nthe conjugal state is so delicate, that it is impossible to prescribe\r\nrules for the conduct of it, so as to fit ten thousand nameless\r\npleasures and disquietudes which arise to people in that condition. But\r\nit is in this as in some other nice cases, where touching upon the\r\nmalady tenderly, is half way to the cure; and there are some faults\r\nwhich need only to be observed to be amended. I am put into this way of\r\nthinking by a late conversation which I am going to give an account of.\r\n\r\nI made a visit the other day to a family for which I have a great\r\nhonour, and found the father, the mother, and two or three of the\r\nyounger children, drop off designedly to leave me alone with the eldest\r\ndaughter, who was but a visitant there as well as myself, and is the\r\nwife of a gentleman of a very fair character in the world. As soon as we\r\nwere alone, I saw her eyes full of tears, and methought she had much to\r\nsay to me, for which she wanted encouragement. \"Madam,\" said I, \"you\r\nknow I wish you all as well as any friend you have: speak freely what I\r\nsee you are oppressed with, and you may be sure, if I cannot relieve\r\nyour distress, you may at least reap so much present advantage, as\r\nsafely to give yourself the ease of uttering it.\" She immediately\r\nassumed the most becoming composure of countenance, and spoke as\r\nfollows: \"It is an aggravation of affliction in a married life, that\r\nthere is a sort of guilt in communicating it: for which reason it is,\r\nthat a lady of your and my acquaintance, instead of speaking to you\r\nherself, desired me the next time I saw you, as you are a professed\r\nfriend to our sex, to turn your thoughts upon the reciprocal\r\ncomplaisance which is the duty of a married state.\r\n\r\n\"My friend was neither in fortune, birth nor education, below the\r\ngentleman whom she has married. Her person, her age, and her character,\r\nare also such as he can make no exception to. But so it is, that from\r\nthe moment the marriage ceremony was over, the obsequiousness of a lover\r\nwas turned into the haughtiness of a master. All the kind endeavours\r\nwhich she uses to please him, are at best but so many instances of her\r\nduty. This insolence takes away that secret satisfaction, which does not\r\nonly excite to virtue, but also rewards it. It abates the fire of a free\r\nand generous love, and embitters all the pleasures of a social life.\"\r\nThe young lady spoke all this with such an air of resentment, as\r\ndiscovered how nearly she was concerned in the distress.\r\n\r\nWhen I observed she had done speaking, \"Madam,\" said I, \"the affliction\r\nyou mention is the greatest that can happen in human life, and I know\r\nbut one consolation in it, if that be a consolation, that the calamity\r\nis a pretty general one. There is nothing so common as for men to enter\r\ninto marriage, without so much as expecting to be happy in it. They seem\r\nto propose to themselves a few holidays in the beginning of it; after\r\nwhich they are to return at best to the usual course of their life; and\r\nfor aught they know, to constant misery and uneasiness. From this false\r\nsense of the state they are going into, proceeds the immediate coldness\r\nand indifference, or hatred and aversion, which attend ordinary\r\nmarriages, or rather bargains to cohabit.\" Our conversation was here\r\ninterrupted by company which came in upon us.\r\n\r\nThe humour of affecting a superior carriage, generally rises from a\r\nfalse notion of the weakness of a female understanding in general, or an\r\noverweening opinion that we have of our own: for when it proceeds from a\r\nnatural ruggedness and brutality of temper, it is altogether\r\nincorrigible, and not to be amended by admonition. Sir Francis Bacon, as\r\nI remember, lays it down as a maxim, that no marriage can be happy in\r\nwhich the wife has no opinion of her husband's wisdom;[165] but without\r\noffence to so great an authority, I may venture to say, that a\r\nsullen-wise man is as bad as a good-natured fool. Knowledge, softened\r\nwith complacency and good breeding, will make a man equally beloved and\r\nrespected; but when joined with a severe, distant and unsociable temper,\r\nit creates rather fear than love. I who am a bachelor, have no other\r\nnotion of conjugal tenderness, but what I learn from books, and shall\r\ntherefore produce three letters of Pliny,[166] who was not only one of\r\nthe greatest, but the most learned men in the whole Roman Empire. At the\r\nsame time I am very much ashamed, that on such occasions I am obliged to\r\nhave recourse to heathen authors, and shall appeal to my readers, if\r\nthey would not think it a mark of a narrow education in a man of quality\r\nto write such passionate letters to any woman but a mistress. They were\r\nall three written at a time when she was at a distance from him: the\r\nfirst of them puts me in mind of a married friend of mine, who said,\r\nsickness itself is pleasant to a man that is attended in it by one whom\r\nhe dearly loves.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pliny to Calphurnia._\r\n\r\n\"I never was so much offended at business, as when it hindered me from\r\ngoing with you into the country, or following you thither: for I more\r\nparticularly wish to be with you at present, that I might be sensible of\r\nthe progress you make in the recovery of your strength and health; as\r\nalso of the entertainment and diversions you can meet with in your\r\nretirement. Believe me, it is an anxious state of mind to live in\r\nignorance of what happens to those whom we passionately love. I am not\r\nonly in pain for your absence, but also for your indisposition. I am\r\nafraid of everything, fancy everything, and, as it is the nature of men\r\nin fear, I fancy those things most which I am most afraid of. Let me\r\ntherefore earnestly desire you to favour me under these my apprehensions\r\nwith one letter every day, or, if possible, with two; for I shall be a\r\nlittle at ease while I am reading your letters, and grow anxious again\r\nas soon as I have read them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Second Letter._\r\n\r\n\"You tell me that you are very much afflicted at my absence, and that\r\nyou have no satisfaction in anything but my writings, which you often\r\nlay by you upon my pillow. You oblige me very much in wishing to see me,\r\nand making me your comforter in my absence. In return, I must let you\r\nknow, I am no less pleased with the letters which you writ to me, and\r\nread them over a thousand times with new pleasure. If your letters are\r\ncapable of giving me so much pleasure, what would your conversation do?\r\nLet me beg of you to write to me often; though at the same time I must\r\nconfess, your letters give me anguish whilst they give me pleasure.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Third Letter._\r\n\r\n\"It is impossible to conceive how much I languish for you in your\r\nabsence; the tender love I bear you is the chief cause of this my\r\nuneasiness, which is still the more insupportable, because absence is\r\nwholly a new thing to us. I lie awake most part of the night in thinking\r\nof you, and several times of the day go as naturally to your apartment,\r\nas if you were there to receive me; but when I miss you, I come away\r\ndejected, out of humour, and like a man that had suffered a repulse.\r\nThere is but one part of the day in which I am relieved from this\r\nanxiety, and that is when I am engaged in public affairs.\r\n\r\n\"You may guess at the uneasy condition of one who has no rest but in\r\nbusiness, no consolation but in trouble.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI shall conclude this paper with a beautiful passage out of Milton,[167]\r\nand leave it as a lecture to those of my own sex, who have a mind to\r\nmake their conversation agreeable as well as instructive, to the fair\r\npartners who are fallen into their care. Eve, having observed that Adam\r\nwas entering into some deep disquisitions with the angel, who was sent\r\nto visit him, is described as retiring from their company, with a design\r\nof learning what should pass there from her husband.\r\n\r\n    _So spake our sire, and by his countenance seemed\r\n    Entering on studious thoughts abstruse, which Eve\r\n    Perceiving where she sat retired in sight,\r\n    With lowliness majestic from her seat\r\n    Rose, and went forth among her fruits and flowers.\r\n    Yet went she not, as not with such discourse\r\n    Delighted, or not capable her ear\r\n    Of what was high: such pleasure she reserved,\r\n    Adam relating, she sole auditress;\r\n    Her husband the relater she preferred\r\n    Before the angel, and of him to ask\r\n    Chose rather: he, she knew, would intermix\r\n    Grateful digressions, and solve high dispute\r\n    With conjugal caresses; from his lip\r\n    Not words alone pleased her. O! when meet now\r\n    Such pairs, in love and mutual honour joined?_\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 165: Bacon, Essay viii., \"Of marriage and single life\": \"It is\r\none of the best bonds, both of chastity and obedience, in the wife, if\r\nshe thinks her husband wise, which she will never do if she finds him\r\njealous.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 166: \"Epist.,\" vi. 4, 7, 5.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 167: \"Paradise Lost,\" viii. 39.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 150.

BICKERSTAFF,\r\n\r\n     \"I have read your paper of this day, and think you have done the\r\n     nuptial state a great deal of justice in the authority you give us\r\n     of Pliny, whose letters to his wife you have there translated: but\r\n     give me leave to tell you, that it is impossible for you, that are\r\n     a bachelor, to have so just a notion of this way of life, as to\r\n     touch the affections of your readers in a particular wherein every\r\n     man's own heart suggests more than the nicest observer can form to\r\n     himself without experience. I therefore, who am an old married man,\r\n     have sat down to give you an account of the matter from my own\r\n     knowledge, and the observations which I have made upon the conduct\r\n     of others in that most agreeable or wretched condition.\r\n\r\n     \"It is very commonly observed, that the most smart pangs which we\r\n     meet with are in the beginning of wedlock, which proceed from\r\n     ignorance of each other's humour, and want of prudence to make\r\n     allowances for a change from the most careful respect to the most\r\n     unbounded familiarity. Hence it arises, that trifles are commonly\r\n     occasions of the greatest anxiety; for contradiction being a thing\r\n     wholly unusual between a new married couple, the smallest instance\r\n     of it is taken for the highest injury; and it very seldom happens,\r\n     that the man is slow enough in assuming the character of a husband,\r\n     or the woman quick enough in condescending to that of a wife. It\r\n     immediately follows, that they think they have all the time of\r\n     their courtship been talking in masks to each other, and therefore\r\n     begin to act like disappointed people. Philander finds Delia\r\n     ill-natured and impertinent; and Delia, Philander surly and\r\n     inconstant.\r\n\r\n     \"I have known a fond couple quarrel in the very honeymoon about\r\n     cutting up a tart: nay, I could name two, who after having had\r\n     seven children, fell out and parted beds upon the boiling of a leg\r\n     of mutton. My very next neighbours have not spoken to one another\r\n     these three days, because they differed in their opinions, whether\r\n     the clock should stand by the window, or over the chimney. It may\r\n     seem strange to you, who are not a married man, when I tell you how\r\n     the least trifle can strike a woman dumb for a week together. But\r\n     if you ever enter into this state, you will find, that the soft sex\r\n     as often express their anger by an obstinate silence, as by an\r\n     ungovernable clamour.\r\n\r\n     \"Those indeed who begin this course of life without jars at their\r\n     setting out, arrive within few months at a pitch of benevolence\r\n     and affection, of which the most perfect friendship is but a faint\r\n     resemblance. As in the unfortunate marriage, the most minute and\r\n     indifferent things are objects of the sharpest resentment; so in a\r\n     happy one, they are occasions of the most exquisite satisfaction.\r\n     For what does not oblige in one we love? What does not offend in\r\n     one we dislike? For these reasons I take it for a rule, that in\r\n     marriage, the chief business is to acquire a prepossession in\r\n     favour of each other. They should consider one another's words and\r\n     actions with a secret indulgence: there should be always an inward\r\n     fondness pleading for each other, such as may add new beauties to\r\n     everything that is excellent, give charms to what is indifferent,\r\n     and cover everything that is defective. For want of this kind\r\n     propensity and bias of mind, the married pair often take things ill\r\n     of each other, which no one else would take notice of in either of\r\n     them.\r\n\r\n     \"But the most unhappy circumstance of all is, where each party is\r\n     always laying up fuel for dissension, and gathering together a\r\n     magazine of provocations to exasperate each other with when they\r\n     are out of humour. These people in common discourse make no scruple\r\n     to let those who are by know they are quarrelling with one another,\r\n     and think they are discreet enough, if they conceal from the\r\n     company the matters which they are hinting at. About a week ago, I\r\n     was entertained for a whole dinner with a mysterious conversation\r\n     of this nature; out of which I could learn no more, than that the\r\n     husband and wife were angry at one another. We had no sooner sat\r\n     down, but says the gentleman of the house, in order to raise\r\n     discourse, 'I thought Margarita[168] sung extremely well last\r\n     night.' Upon this, says the lady, looking as pale as ashes, 'I\r\n     suppose she had cherry-coloured ribands[169] on.' 'No,' answered\r\n     the husband, with a flush in his face, 'but she had laced\r\n     shoes.'[170] I look upon it, that a bystander on such occasions has\r\n     as much reason to be out of countenance as either of the\r\n     combatants. To turn off my confusion, and seem regardless of what\r\n     had passed, I desired the servant who attended to give me the\r\n     vinegar, which unluckily created a new dialogue of hints; for as\r\n     far as I could gather by the subsequent discourse, they had\r\n     dissented the day before about the preference of elder to wine\r\n     vinegar. In the midst of their discourse, there appeared a dish of\r\n     chickens and asparagus, when the husband seemed disposed to lay\r\n     aside all disputes; and looking upon her with a great deal of good\r\n     nature, said, 'Pray, my dear, will you help my friend to a wing of\r\n     the fowl that lies next you, for I think it looks extremely well.'\r\n     The lady, instead of answering him, addressing herself to me,\r\n     'Pray, sir,' said she, 'do you in Surrey reckon the white- or the\r\n     black-legged fowls the best?' I found the husband changed colour at\r\n     the question; and before I could answer, asked me, whether we did\r\n     not call hops 'broom' in our country? I quickly found, they did not\r\n     ask questions so much out of curiosity as anger: for which reason I\r\n     thought fit to keep my opinion to myself, and, as an honest man\r\n     ought (when he sees two friends in warmth with each other), I took\r\n     the first opportunity I could to leave them by themselves.\r\n\r\n     \"You see, sir, I have laid before you only small incidents, which\r\n     are seemingly trivial; but take it from a man who am very well\r\n     experienced in this state, they are principally evils of this\r\n     nature which make marriages unhappy. At the same time, that I may\r\n     do justice to this excellent institution, I must own to you, there\r\n     are unspeakable pleasures which are as little regarded in the\r\n     computation of the advantages of marriage, as the others are in the\r\n     usual survey that is made of its misfortunes.\r\n\r\n     \"Lovemore and his wife live together in the happy possession of\r\n     each other's hearts, and by that means have no indifferent moments,\r\n     but their whole life is one continued scene of delight. Their\r\n     passion for each other communicates a certain satisfaction, like\r\n     that which they themselves are in, to all that approach them. When\r\n     she enters the place where he is, you see a pleasure which he\r\n     cannot conceal, nor he or any one else describe. In so consummate\r\n     an affection, the very presence of the person beloved has the\r\n     effect of the most agreeable conversation. Whether they have matter\r\n     to talk of or not, they enjoy the pleasures of society, and at the\r\n     same time the freedom of solitude. Their ordinary life is to be\r\n     preferred to the happiest moments of other lovers. In a word, they\r\n     have each of them great merit, live in the esteem of all who know\r\n     them, and seem but to comply with the opinions of their friends, in\r\n     the just value they have for each other.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 168: Francesca Margarita de l'Epine, a native of Tuscany. This\r\ncelebrated singer performed in many of the earlier Italian operas\r\nrepresented in England. She and Mrs. Tofts were rivals for the public\r\nfavour, and it seems they divided pretty equally the applause of the\r\ntown. She sung on the stage, at public entertainments, in concerts at\r\nYork Buildings and Stationers' Hall, and once in the hall of the Middle\r\nTemple, in a musical performance at the Christmas revels of that\r\nsociety. One Greber, a German musician, who studied some few years in\r\nItaly, brought this Italian with him to England, whence she was known by\r\nthe name of Greber's Peg. It is said that she had afterwards a criminal\r\nconnection with Daniel Earl of Nottingham. In a shrewd epigram written\r\nby Lord Halifax, she is styled \"The Tawny Tuscan,\" and he is called\r\n\"Tall Nottingham.\" Margarita continued a singer till about the year\r\n1718, when, having, as Downes relates, scraped together above ten\r\nthousand guineas, she retired, and was afterwards married to Dr.\r\nPepusch. The epithet \"tawny\" was very characteristic of her, for she was\r\nremarkably swarthy, and in general so destitute of personal charms, that\r\nher husband seldom called her by any other name than Hecate, to which\r\nshe answered very readily. She died about 1740. See Sir J.

By this means the\r\njewels appear in their true and genuine lustre, while there is no colour\r\nthat can infect their brightness, or give a false cast to the water.\r\nWhen I was at the opera the other night, the assembly of ladies in\r\nmourning[172] made me consider them in the same kind of view. A dress\r\nwherein there is so little variety, shows the face in all its natural\r\ncharms, and makes one differ from another only as it is more or less\r\nbeautiful. Painters are ever careful of offending against a rule which\r\nis so essential in all just representation. The chief figure must have\r\nthe strongest point of light, and not be injured by any gay colourings\r\nthat may draw away the attention to any less considerable part of the\r\npicture. The present fashion obliges everybody to be dressed with\r\npropriety, and makes the ladies' faces the principal objects of sight.\r\nEvery beautiful person shines out in all the excellence with which\r\nNature has adorned her: gaudy ribands and glaring colours being now out\r\nof use, the sex has no opportunity given them to disfigure themselves,\r\nwhich they seldom fail to do whenever it lies in their power. When a\r\nwoman comes to her glass, she does not employ her time in making herself\r\nlook more advantageously what she really is, but endeavours to be as\r\nmuch another creature as she possibly can. Whether this happens, because\r\nthey stay so long, and attend their work so diligently, that they forget\r\nthe faces and persons which they first sat down with, or whatever it is,\r\nthey seldom rise from the toilet the same women they appeared when they\r\nbegan to dress. What jewel can the charming Cleora place in her ears,\r\nthat can please her beholders so much as her eyes? The cluster of\r\ndiamonds upon the breast can add no beauty to the fair chest of ivory\r\nwhich supports it. It may indeed tempt a man to steal a woman, but never\r\nto love her. Let Thalestris change herself into a motley parti-coloured\r\nanimal: the pearl necklace, the flowered stomacher, the artificial\r\nnosegay, and shaded furbelow,[173] may be of use to attract the eye of\r\nthe beholder, and turn it from the imperfections of her features and\r\nshape. But if ladies will take my word for it (and as they dress to\r\nplease men, they ought to consult our fancy rather than their own in\r\nthis particular), I can assure them, there is nothing touches our\r\nimagination so much as a beautiful woman in a plain dress. There might\r\nbe more agreeable ornaments found in our own manufacture, than any that\r\nrise out of the looms of Persia.\r\n\r\nThis, I know, is a very harsh doctrine to womankind, who are carried\r\naway with everything that is showy, and with what delights the eye, more\r\nthan any other species of living creatures whatsoever. Were the minds of\r\nthe sex laid open, we should find the chief idea in one to be a tippet,\r\nin another a muff, in a third a fan, and in a fourth a farthingale. The\r\nmemory of an old visiting lady is so filled with gloves, silks, and\r\nribands, that I can look upon it as nothing else but a toy-shop. A\r\nmatron of my acquaintance complaining of her daughter's vanity, was\r\nobserving, that she had all of a sudden held up her head higher than\r\nordinary, and taken an air that showed a secret satisfaction in herself,\r\nmixed with a scorn of others. \"I did not know,\" says my friend, \"what to\r\nmake of the carriage of this fantastical girl, until I was informed by\r\nher elder sister, that she had a pair of striped garters on.\" This odd\r\nturn of mind often makes the sex unhappy, and disposes them to be struck\r\nwith everything that makes a show, however trifling and superficial.\r\n\r\nMany a lady has fetched a sigh at the toss of a wig, and been ruined by\r\nthe tapping of a snuff-box. It is impossible to describe all the\r\nexecution that was done by the shoulder-knot[174] while that fashion\r\nprevailed, or to reckon up all the virgins that have fallen a sacrifice\r\nto a pair of fringed gloves.[175] A sincere heart has not made half so\r\nmany conquests as an open waistcoat,[176] and I should be glad to see an\r\nable head make so good a figure in a woman's company as a pair of red\r\nheels.[177] A Grecian hero,[178] when he was asked whether he could play\r\nupon the lute, thought he had made a very good reply when he answered,\r\n\"No, but I can make a great city of a little one.\" Notwithstanding his\r\nboasted wisdom, I appeal to the heart of any toast in town, whether she\r\nwould not think the lutenist preferable to the statesman. I do not speak\r\nthis out of any aversion that I have to the sex: on the contrary, I have\r\nalways had a tenderness for them; but I must confess, it troubles me\r\nvery much to see the generality of them place their affections on\r\nimproper objects, and give up all the pleasures of life for gewgaws and\r\ntrifles.\r\n\r\nMrs. Margery Bickerstaff, my great aunt, had a thousand pounds to her\r\nportion, which our family was desirous of keeping among themselves, and\r\ntherefore used all possible means to turn off her thoughts from\r\nmarriage. The method they took was, in any time of danger to throw a new\r\ngown or petticoat in her way. When she was about twenty-five years of\r\nage, she fell in love with a man of an agreeable temper, and equal\r\nfortune, and would certainly have married him, had not my grandfather,\r\nSir Jacob, dressed her up in a suit of flowered satin; upon which, she\r\nset so immoderate a value upon herself, that the lover was contemned and\r\ndiscarded. In the fortieth year of her age, she was again smitten, but\r\nvery luckily transferred her passion to a tippet, which was presented to\r\nher by another relation who was in the plot. This, with a white sarcenet\r\nhood, kept her safe in the family till fifty. About sixty, which\r\ngenerally produces a kind of latter spring[179] in amorous\r\nconstitutions, my Aunt Margery had again a colt's-tooth[180] in her\r\nhead, and would certainly have eloped from the mansion-house, had not\r\nher brother Simon, who was a wise man, and a scholar, advised to dress\r\nher in cherry-coloured ribands,[181] which was the only expedient that\r\ncould have been found out by the wit of man to preserve the thousand\r\npounds in our family, part of which I enjoy at this time.\r\n\r\nThis discourse puts me in mind of a humorist mentioned by Horace,[182]\r\ncalled Eutrapelus, who, when he designed to do a man a mischief, made\r\nhim a present of a gay suit; and brings to my memory another passage of\r\nthe same author, when he describes the most ornamental dress that a\r\nwoman can appear in with two words, _simplex munditiis_,[183] which I\r\nhave quoted for the benefit of my female readers.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 171: This paper, though not included in Addison's Works, may,\r\nas Nichols suggested, be his.

For this reason, persons of\r\nstudious and contemplative natures often entertain themselves with the\r\nhistory of past ages, or raise schemes and conjectures upon futurity.\r\nFor my own part, I love to range through that half of eternity which is\r\nstill to come, rather than look on that which is already run out;\r\nbecause I know I have a real share and interest in the one, whereas all\r\nthat was transacted in the other can be only matter of curiosity to me.\r\n\r\nUpon this account, I have been always very much delighted with\r\nmeditating on the soul's immortality, and in reading the several notions\r\nwhich the wisest of men, both ancient and modern, have entertained on\r\nthat subject. What the opinions of the greatest philosophers have been,\r\nI have several times hinted at, and shall give an account of them from\r\ntime to time as occasion requires. It may likewise be worth while to\r\nconsider, what men of the most exalted genius, and elevated imagination,\r\nhave thought of this matter. Among these, Homer stands up as a prodigy\r\nof mankind, that looks down upon the rest of human creatures as a\r\nspecies beneath him. Since he is the most ancient heathen author, we\r\nmay guess from his relation, what were the common opinions in his time\r\nconcerning the state of the soul after death.\r\n\r\nUlysses, he tells us, made a voyage to the regions of the dead, in order\r\nto consult Tiresias how he should return to his own country, and\r\nrecommend himself to the favour of the gods. The poet scarce introduces\r\na single person, who does not suggest some useful precept to his reader,\r\nand designs his description of the dead for the amendment of the living.\r\n\r\nUlysses, after having made a very plenteous sacrifice, sat him down by\r\nthe pool of holy blood, which attracted a prodigious assembly of ghosts\r\nof all ages and conditions, that hovered about the hero, and feasted\r\nupon the steams of his oblation. The first he knew, was the shade of\r\nElpenor, who, to show the activity of a spirit above that of body, is\r\nrepresented as arrived there long before Ulysses, notwithstanding the\r\nwinds and seas had contributed all their force to hasten his voyage\r\nthither. This Elpenor, to inspire the reader with a detestation of\r\ndrunkenness, and at the same time with a religious care of doing proper\r\nhonours to the dead, describes himself as having broken his neck in a\r\ndebauch of wine; and begs Ulysses, that for the repose of his soul, he\r\nwould build a monument over him, and perform funeral rites to his\r\nmemory. Ulysses with great sorrow of heart promises to fulfil his\r\nrequest, and is immediately diverted to an object much more moving than\r\nthe former. The ghost of his own mother Anticlea, whom he still thought\r\nliving, appears to him among the multitude of shades that surrounded\r\nhim, and sits down at a small distance from him by the lake of blood,\r\nwithout speaking to him, or knowing who he was. Ulysses was exceedingly\r\ntroubled at the sight, and could not forbear weeping as he looked upon\r\nher; but being all along set forth as a pattern of consummate wisdom,\r\nhe makes his affection give way to prudence; and therefore, upon his\r\nseeing Tiresias, does not reveal himself to his mother, till he had\r\nconsulted that great prophet, who was the occasion of this his descent\r\ninto the empire of the dead. Tiresias having cautioned him to keep\r\nhimself and his companions free from the guilt of sacrilege, and to pay\r\nhis devotions to all the gods, promises him a safe return to his kingdom\r\nand family, and a happy old age in the enjoyment of them.\r\n\r\nThe poet having thus with great art kept the curiosity of his reader in\r\nsuspense, represents his wise man, after the despatch of his business\r\nwith Tiresias, as yielding himself up to the calls of natural affection,\r\nand making himself known to his mother. Her eyes are no sooner opened,\r\nbut she cries out in tears, \"Oh my son!\" and inquires into the occasions\r\nthat brought him thither, and the fortune that attended him.\r\n\r\nUlysses on the other hand desires to know, what the sickness was that\r\nhad sent her into those regions, and the condition in which she had left\r\nhis father, his son, and more particularly his wife. She tells him, they\r\nwere all three inconsolable for his absence; \"and as for myself,\" says\r\nshe, \"that was the sickness of which I died. My impatience for your\r\nreturn, my anxiety for your welfare, and my fondness for my dear\r\nUlysses, were the only distempers that preyed upon my life, and\r\nseparated my soul from my body.\" Ulysses was melted with these\r\nexpressions of tenderness, and thrice endeavoured to catch the\r\napparition in his arms, that he might hold his mother to his bosom and\r\nweep over her.\r\n\r\nThis gives the poet occasion to describe the notion the heathens at that\r\ntime had of an unbodied soul, in the excuse which the mother makes for\r\nseeming to withdraw herself from her son's embraces. \"The soul,\" says\r\nshe, \"is composed neither of bones, flesh, nor sinews, but leaves behind\r\nher all those encumbrances of mortality to be consumed on the funeral\r\npile. As soon as she has thus cast her burden she makes her escape, and\r\nflies away from it like a dream.\"\r\n\r\nWhen this melancholy conversation is at an end, the poet draws up to\r\nview as charming a vision as could enter into man's imagination. He\r\ndescribes the next who appeared to Ulysses, to have been the shades of\r\nthe finest women that had ever lived upon the earth, and who had either\r\nbeen the daughters of kings, the mistresses of gods, or mothers of\r\nheroes, such as Antiope, Alcmena, Leda, Ariadne, Iphimedia, Eriphyle,\r\nand several others of whom he gives a catalogue, with a short history of\r\ntheir adventures. The beautiful assembly of apparitions were all\r\ngathered together about the blood: \"each of them,\" says Ulysses (as a\r\ngentle satire upon female vanity), \"giving me an account of her birth\r\nand family.\" This scene of extraordinary women seems to have been\r\ndesigned by the poet as a lecture of mortality to the whole sex, and to\r\nput them in mind of what they must expect, notwithstanding the greatest\r\nperfections, and highest honours, they can arrive at.\r\n\r\nThe circle of beauties at length disappeared, and was succeeded by the\r\nshades of several Grecian heroes who had been engaged with Ulysses in\r\nthe siege of Troy. The first that approached was Agamemnon, the\r\ngeneralissimo of that great expedition, who at the appearance of his old\r\nfriend wept very bitterly, and without saying anything to him,\r\nendeavoured to grasp him by the hand. Ulysses, who was much moved at the\r\nsight, poured out a flood of tears, and asked him the occasion of his\r\ndeath, which Agamemnon related to him in all its tragical\r\ncircumstances; how he was murdered at a banquet by the contrivance of\r\nhis own wife, in confederacy with her adulterer: from whence he takes\r\noccasion to reproach the whole sex, after a manner which would be\r\ninexcusable in a man who had not been so great a sufferer by them. \"My\r\nwife,\" says he, \"has disgraced all the women that shall ever be born\r\ninto the world, even those who hereafter shall be innocent. Take care\r\nhow you grow too fond of your wife. Never tell her all you know. If you\r\nreveal some things to her, be sure you keep others concealed from her.\r\nYou indeed have nothing to fear from your Penelope, she will not use you\r\nas my wife has treated me; however, take care how you trust a woman.\"\r\nThe poet, in this and other instances, according to the system of many\r\nheathen as well as Christian philosophers, shows how anger, revenge, and\r\nother habits which the soul had contracted in the body, subsist and grow\r\nin it under its stage of separation.\r\n\r\nI am extremely pleased with the companions which the poet in the next\r\ndescription assigns to Achilles. \"Achilles,\" says the hero, \"came up to\r\nme with Patroclus and Antilochus.\" By which we may see that it was\r\nHomer's opinion, and probably that of the age he lived in, that the\r\nfriendships which are made among the living will likewise continue among\r\nthe dead. Achilles inquires after the welfare of his son, and of his\r\nfather, with a fierceness of the same character that Homer has\r\neverywhere expressed in the actions of his life. The passage relating to\r\nhis son is so extremely beautiful, that I must not omit it. Ulysses,\r\nafter having described him as wise in council and active in war, and\r\nmentioned the foes whom he had slain in battle, adds an observation that\r\nhe himself had made of his behaviour whilst he lay in the wooden horse.\r\n\"Most of the generals,\" says he, \"that were with us either wept or\r\ntrembled: as for your son, I neither saw him wipe a tear from his\r\ncheeks, nor change his countenance. On the contrary, he would often lay\r\nhis hand upon his sword, or grasp his spear, as impatient to employ them\r\nagainst the Trojans.\" He then informs his father of the great honour and\r\nrewards which he had purchased before Troy, and of his return from it\r\nwithout a wound. The shade of Achilles, says the poet, was so pleased\r\nwith the account he received of his son, that he inquired no further,\r\nbut stalked away with more than ordinary majesty over the green meadow\r\nthat lay before them.\r\n\r\nThis last circumstance of a deceased father's rejoicing in the behaviour\r\nof his son is very finely contrived by Homer, as an incentive to virtue,\r\nand made use of by none that I know besides himself.\r\n\r\nThe description of Ajax, which follows, and his refusing to speak to\r\nUlysses, who had won the armour of Achilles from him, and by that means\r\noccasioned his death, is admired by every one that reads it. When\r\nUlysses relates the sullenness of his deportment, and considers the\r\ngreatness of the hero, he expresses himself with generous and noble\r\nsentiments. \"Oh! that I had never gained a prize which cost the life of\r\nso brave a man as Ajax! Who, for the beauty of his person, and greatness\r\nof his actions, was inferior to none but the divine Achilles.\" The same\r\nnoble condescension, which never dwells but in truly great minds, and\r\nsuch as Homer would represent that of Ulysses to have been, discovers\r\nitself likewise in the speech which he made to the ghost of Ajax on that\r\noccasion. \"O Ajax!\" says he, \"will you keep your resentments even after\r\ndeath? What destructions hath this fatal armour brought upon the Greeks,\r\nby robbing them of you, who were their bulwark and defence? Achilles is\r\nnot more bitterly lamented among us than you. Impute not then your death\r\nto any one but Jupiter, who out of his anger to the Greeks, took you\r\naway from among them: let me entreat you to approach me; restrain the\r\nfierceness of your wrath, and the greatness of your soul, and hear what\r\nI have to say to you.\" Ajax, without making a reply, turned his back\r\nupon him, and retired into a crowd of ghosts.\r\n\r\nUlysses, after all these visions, took a view of those impious wretches\r\nwho lay in tortures for the crimes they had committed upon the earth,\r\nwhom he describes under the varieties of pain, as so many marks of\r\ndivine vengeance, to deter others from following their example. He then\r\ntells us that notwithstanding he had a great curiosity to see the heroes\r\nthat lived in the ages before him, the ghosts began to gather about him\r\nin such prodigious multitudes, and with such a confusion of voices, that\r\nhis heart trembled as he saw himself amidst so great a scene of horrors.\r\nHe adds, that he was afraid lest some hideous spectre should appear to\r\nhim, that might terrify him to distraction; and therefore withdrew in\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nI question not but my reader will be pleased with this description of a\r\nfuture state, represented by such a noble and fruitful imagination, that\r\nhad nothing to direct it besides the light of nature, and the opinions\r\nof a dark and ignorant age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 153.                                                    [ADDISON.\r\n\r\nFrom _Thursday, March 30_, to _Saturday, April 1, 1710_.\r\n\r\n    Bambalio, clangor, stridor, taratantara, murmur.--FARN., Rhet.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, March 31._\r\n\r\nI have heard of a very valuable picture, wherein all the painters of the\r\nage in which it was drawn are represented sitting together in a circle,\r\nand joining in a concert of music. Each of them plays upon such a\r\nparticular instrument as is the most suitable to his character, and\r\nexpresses that style and manner of painting which is peculiar to him.\r\nThe famous cupola-painter of those times, to show the grandeur and\r\nboldness of his figures, has a horn in his mouth, which he seems to wind\r\nwith great strength and force. On the contrary, an eminent artist, who\r\nwrought up his pictures with the greatest accuracy, and gave them all\r\nthose delicate touches which are apt to please the nicest eye, is\r\nrepresented as tuning a theorbo. The same kind of humour runs through\r\nthe whole piece.\r\n\r\nI have often from this hint imagined to myself, that different talents\r\nin discourse might be shadowed out after the same manner by different\r\nkinds of music; and that the several conversable parts of mankind in\r\nthis great city might be cast into proper characters and divisions, as\r\nthey resemble several instruments that are in use among the masters of\r\nharmony. Of these therefore in their order, and first of the drum.\r\n\r\nYour drums are the blusterers in conversation, that with a loud laugh,\r\nunnatural mirth, and a torrent of noise, domineer in public assemblies,\r\noverbear men of sense, stun their companions, and fill the place they\r\nare in with a rattling sound, that has seldom any wit, humour, or good\r\nbreeding in it. The drum notwithstanding, by this boisterous vivacity,\r\nis very proper to impose upon the ignorant; and in conversation with\r\nladies who are not of the finest taste, often passes for a man of mirth\r\nand wit, and for wonderful pleasant company. I need not observe, that\r\nthe emptiness of the drum very much contributes to its noise.\r\n\r\nThe lute is a character directly opposite to the drum, that sounds very\r\nfinely by itself, or in a very small concert. Its notes are exquisitely\r\nsweet, and very low, easily drowned in a multitude of instruments, and\r\neven lost among a few, unless you give a particular attention to it. A\r\nlute is seldom heard in a company of more than five, whereas a drum will\r\nshow itself to advantage in an assembly of five hundred. The lutenists\r\ntherefore are men of a fine genius, uncommon reflection, great\r\naffability, and esteemed chiefly by persons of a good taste, who are the\r\nonly proper judges of so delightful and soft a melody.\r\n\r\nThe trumpet is an instrument that has in it no compass of music or\r\nvariety of sound, but is notwithstanding very agreeable, so long as it\r\nkeeps within its pitch. It has not above four or five notes, which are\r\nhowever very pleasing, and capable of exquisite turns and modulations.\r\nThe gentlemen who fall under this denomination, are your men of the most\r\nfashionable education and refined breeding, who have learned a certain\r\nsmoothness of discourse, and sprightliness of air, from the polite\r\ncompany they have kept; but at the same time they have shallow parts,\r\nweak judgments, and a short reach of understanding: a playhouse, a\r\ndrawing-room, a ball, a visiting-day, or a Ring at Hyde Park, are the\r\nfew notes they are masters of, which they touch upon in all\r\nconversations. The trumpet however is a necessary instrument about a\r\nCourt, and a proper enlivener of a concert, though of no great harmony\r\nby itself.\r\n\r\nViolins are the lively, forward, importunate wits that distinguish\r\nthemselves by the flourishes of imagination, sharpness of repartee,\r\nglances of satire, and bear away the upper part in every concert. I\r\ncannot however but observe that, when a man is not disposed to hear\r\nmusic, there is not a more disagreeable sound in harmony than that of a\r\nviolin.\r\n\r\nThere is another musical instrument, which is more frequent in this\r\nnation than any other; I mean your bass-viol, which grumbles in the\r\nbottom of the concert, and with a surly masculine sound strengthens the\r\nharmony, and tempers the sweetness of the several instruments that play\r\nalong with it. The bass-viol is an instrument of a quite different\r\nnature to the trumpet, and may signify men of rough sense, and\r\nunpolished parts, who do not love to hear themselves talk, but sometimes\r\nbreak out with an agreeable bluntness, unexpected wit, and surly\r\npleasantries, to the no small diversion of their friends and companions.\r\nIn short, I look upon every sensible true-born Briton to be naturally a\r\nbass-viol.\r\n\r\nAs for your rural wits, who talk with great eloquence and alacrity of\r\nfoxes, hounds, horses, quickset hedges, and six-bar gates, double\r\nditches, and broken necks, I am in doubt, whether I should give them a\r\nplace in the conversable world. However, if they will content themselves\r\nwith being raised to the dignity of hunting-horns, I shall desire for\r\nthe future that they may be known by that name.\r\n\r\nI must not here omit the bagpipe species, that will entertain you from\r\nmorning to night with the repetition of the few notes, which are played\r\nover and over, with the perpetual humming of a drone running underneath\r\nthem. These are your dull, heavy, tedious storytellers, the load and\r\nburden of conversations, that set up for men of importance, by knowing\r\nsecret history, and giving an account of transactions, that whether they\r\never passed in the world or not, does not signify a halfpenny to its\r\ninstruction, or its welfare. Some have observed, that the northern parts\r\nof this island are more particularly fruitful in bagpipes.\r\n\r\nThere are so very few persons who are masters in every kind of\r\nconversation, and can talk on all subjects, that I don't know whether\r\nwe should make a distinct species of them: nevertheless, that my scheme\r\nmay not be defective, for the sake of those few who are endowed with\r\nsuch extraordinary talents, I shall allow them to be harpsichords, a\r\nkind of music which every one knows is a concert by itself.\r\n\r\nAs for your passing-bells, who look upon mirth as criminal, and talk of\r\nnothing but what is melancholy in itself, and mortifying to human\r\nnature, I shall not mention them.\r\n\r\nI shall likewise pass over in silence all the rabble of mankind that\r\ncrowd our streets, coffee-houses, feasts, and public tables. I cannot\r\ncall their discourse conversation, but rather something that is\r\npractised in imitation of it. For which reason, if I would describe them\r\nby any musical instrument, it should be by those modern inventions of\r\nthe bladder and string, tongs and key, marrow-bone and cleaver.\r\n\r\nMy reader will doubtless observe, that I have only touched here upon\r\nmale instruments, having reserved my female concert to another occasion.\r\nIf he has a mind to know where these several characters are to be met\r\nwith, I could direct him to a whole club of drums; not to mention\r\nanother of bagpipes, which I have before given some account of in my\r\ndescription of our nightly meetings in Sheer Lane. The lutes may often\r\nbe met with in couples upon the banks of a crystal stream, or in the\r\nretreats of shady woods and flowery meadows; which for different reasons\r\nare likewise the great resort of your hunting-horns. Bass-viols are\r\nfrequently to be found over a glass of stale beer and a pipe of tobacco;\r\nwhereas those who set up for violins, seldom fail to make their\r\nappearance at Will's once every evening. You may meet with a trumpet\r\nanywhere on the other side of Charing Cross.\r\n\r\nThat we may draw something for our advantage in life out of the\r\nforegoing discourse, I must entreat my reader to make a narrow search\r\ninto his life and conversation, and upon his leaving any company, to\r\nexamine himself seriously, whether he has behaved himself in it like a\r\ndrum or a trumpet, a violin or a bass-viol; and accordingly endeavour to\r\nmend his music for the future. For my own part, I must confess, I was a\r\ndrum for many years; nay, and a very noisy one, till having polished\r\nmyself a little in good company, I threw as much of the trumpet into my\r\nconversation as was possible for a man of an impetuous temper, by which\r\nmixture of different musics, I look upon myself, during the course of\r\nmany years, to have resembled a tabor and pipe. I have since very much\r\nendeavoured at the sweetness of the lute; but in spite of all my\r\nresolutions, I must confess with great confusion, that I find myself\r\ndaily degenerating into a bagpipe; whether it be the effect of my old\r\nage, or of the company I keep, I know not. All that I can do, is to keep\r\na watch over my conversation, and to silence the drone as soon as I find\r\nit begin to hum in my discourse, being determined rather to hear the\r\nnotes of others, than to play out of time, and encroach upon their parts\r\nin the concert by the noise of so tiresome an instrument.\r\n\r\nI shall conclude this paper with a letter which I received last night\r\nfrom a friend of mine, who knows very well my notions upon this subject,\r\nand invites me to pass the evening at his house with a select company of\r\nfriends, in the following words:\r\n\r\n     \"DEAR ISAAC,\r\n\r\n     \"I intend to have a concert at my house this evening, having by\r\n     great chance got a harpsichord, which I am sure will entertain you\r\n     very agreeably.

[ADDISON.\r\n\r\nFrom _Saturday, April 1_, to _Tuesday, April 4, 1710_.\r\n\r\n    Obscuris vera involvens.--VIRG., Æn. vi. 100.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, April 3._\r\n\r\nWe have already examined Homer's description of a future state, and the\r\ncondition in which he has placed the souls of the deceased. I shall in\r\nthis paper make some observations on the account which Virgil has given\r\nus of the same subject, who, besides a greatness of genius, had all the\r\nlights of philosophy and human learning to assist and guide him in his\r\ndiscoveries.\r\n\r\nÆneas is represented as descending into the empire of death, with a\r\nprophetess by his side, who instructs him in the secrets of those lower\r\nregions.\r\n\r\nUpon the confines of the dead, and before the very gates of this\r\ninfernal world, Virgil describes[185] several inhabitants, whose natures\r\nare wonderfully suited to the situation of the place, as being either\r\nthe occasions or resemblances of death. Of the first kind are the\r\nshadows[186] of Sickness, Old Age, Fear, Famine, and Poverty\r\n(apparitions very terrible to behold); with several others, as Toil,\r\nWar, Contention, and Discord, which contribute all of them to people\r\nthis common receptacle of human souls. As this was likewise a very\r\nproper residence for everything that resembles death, the poet tells us,\r\nthat Sleep, whom he represents as a near relation to Death, has likewise\r\nhis habitation in these quarters, and describes in them a huge gloomy\r\nelm-tree, which seems a very proper ornament for the place, and is\r\npossessed by an innumerable swarm of Dreams, that hang in clusters under\r\nevery leaf of it. He then gives us a list of imaginary persons, who very\r\nnaturally lie within the shadow of the dream-tree, as being of the same\r\nkind of make in themselves, and the materials or (to use Shakespeare's\r\nphrase) the stuff of which dreams are made. Such are the shades of the\r\ngiant with a hundred hands, and of his brother with three bodies; of the\r\ndouble-shaped Centaur and Scylla; the Gorgon with snaky hair; the Harpy\r\nwith a woman's face and lion's talons; the seven-headed Hydra; and the\r\nChimæra, which breathes forth a flame, and is a compound of three\r\nanimals. These several mixed natures, the creatures of imagination, are\r\nnot only introduced with great art after the dreams; but as they are\r\nplanted at the very entrance, and within the very gates of those\r\nregions, do probably denote the wild deliriums and extravagances of\r\nfancy, which the Soul usually falls into when she is just upon the verge\r\nof death.\r\n\r\nThus far Æneas travels in an allegory. The rest of the description is\r\ndrawn with great exactness, according to the religion of the heathens,\r\nand the opinions of the platonic philosophy. I shall not trouble my\r\nreader with a common dull story, that gives an account why the heathens\r\nfirst of all supposed a ferryman in hell, and his name to be Charon; but\r\nmust not pass over in silence the point of doctrine which Virgil has\r\nvery much insisted upon in this book, that the souls of those who are\r\nunburied, are not permitted to go over into their respective places of\r\nrest till they have wandered a hundred years upon the banks of Styx.\r\nThis was probably an invention of the heathen priesthood, to make the\r\npeople extremely careful of performing proper rites and ceremonies to\r\nthe memory of the dead. I shall not, however, with the infamous\r\nscribblers of the age, take an occasion from such a circumstance, to run\r\ninto declamations against priestcraft, but rather look upon it even in\r\nthis light as a religious artifice, to raise in the minds of men an\r\nesteem for the memory of their forefathers, and a desire to recommend\r\nthemselves to that of posterity; as also to excite in them an ambition\r\nof imitating the virtues of the deceased, and to keep alive in their\r\nthoughts the sense of the soul's immortality. In a word, we may say in\r\ndefence of the severe opinions relating to the shades of unburied\r\npersons, what has been said by some of our divines in regard to the\r\nrigid doctrines concerning the souls of such who die without being\r\ninitiated into our religion, that supposing they should be erroneous,\r\nthey can do no hurt to the dead, and will have a good effect upon the\r\nliving, in making them cautious of neglecting such necessary\r\nsolemnities.\r\n\r\nCharon is no sooner appeased, and the triple-headed dog laid asleep, but\r\nÆneas makes his entrance into the dominions of Pluto. There are three\r\nkinds of persons described as being situated on the borders; and I can\r\ngive no reason for their being stationed there in so particular a\r\nmanner, but because none of them seem to have had a proper right to a\r\nplace among the dead, as not having run out the whole thread of their\r\ndays, and finished the term of life that had been allotted them upon\r\nearth. The first of these are the souls of infants, who are snatched\r\naway by untimely ends: the second, are of those who are put to death\r\nwrongfully, and by an unjust sentence; and the third, of those who grew\r\nweary of their lives, and laid violent hands upon themselves. As for\r\nthe second of these, Virgil adds with great beauty, that Minos, the\r\njudge of the dead, is employed in giving them a rehearing, and assigning\r\nthem their several quarters suitable to the parts they acted in life.\r\nThe poet, after having mentioned the souls of those unhappy men who\r\ndestroyed themselves, breaks out into a fine exclamation: \"Oh, how\r\ngladly,\" says he, \"would they now endure life with all its miseries! But\r\nthe Destinies forbid their return to earth, and the waters of Styx\r\nsurround them with nine streams that are unpassable.\" It is very\r\nremarkable, that Virgil, notwithstanding self-murder was so frequent\r\namong the heathens, and had been practised by some of the greatest men\r\nin the very age before him, has here represented it as so heinous a\r\ncrime. But in this particular he was guided by the doctrines of his\r\ngreat master Plato, who says on this subject, that a man is placed in\r\nhis station of life like a soldier in his proper post, which he is not\r\nto quit whatever may happen, until he is called off by his commander who\r\nplanted him in it.\r\n\r\nThere is another point in the platonic philosophy, which Virgil has made\r\nthe groundwork of the greatest part in the piece we are now examining,\r\nhaving with wonderful art and beauty materialised, if I may so call it,\r\na scheme of abstracted notions, and clothed the most nice refined\r\nconceptions of philosophy in sensible images and poetical\r\nrepresentations. The Platonists tell us, that the Soul, during her\r\nresidence in the body, contracts many virtuous and vicious habits, so as\r\nto become a beneficent, mild, charitable, or an angry, malicious,\r\nrevengeful being: a substance inflamed with lust, avarice, and pride;\r\nor, on the contrary, brightened with pure, generous, and humble\r\ndispositions: that these and the like habits of virtue and vice growing\r\ninto the very essence of the Soul, survive and gather strength in her\r\nafter her dissolution: that the torments of a vicious soul in a future\r\nstate arise principally from those importunate passions which are not\r\ncapable of being gratified without a body; and that on the contrary, the\r\nhappiness of virtuous minds very much consists in their being employed\r\nin sublime speculations, innocent diversions, sociable affections, and\r\nall the ecstasies of passion and rapture which are agreeable to\r\nreasonable natures, and of which they gained a relish in this life.\r\n\r\nUpon this foundation, the poet raises that beautiful description of the\r\nsecret haunts and walks which he tells us are inhabited by deceased\r\nlovers.\r\n\r\n\"Not far from hence,\" says he, \"lies a great waste of plains, that are\r\ncalled, the 'fields of melancholy.' In these grows a forest of myrtle,\r\ndivided into many shady retirements and covered walks, and inhabited by\r\nthe souls of those who pined away with love. The passion,\" says he,\r\n\"continues with them after death.\" He then gives a list of this\r\nlanguishing tribe, in which his own Dido makes the principal figure, and\r\nis described as living in this soft romantic scene with the shade of her\r\nfirst husband Sichæus.[187]\r\n\r\nThe poet in the next place mentions another plain that was peopled with\r\nthe ghosts of warriors, as still delighting in each other's company, and\r\npleased with the exercise of arms. He there represents the Grecian\r\ngenerals and common soldiers who perished in the siege of Troy as drawn\r\nup in squadrons, and terrified at the approach of Æneas, which renewed\r\nin them those impressions of fear they had before received in battle\r\nwith the Trojans. He afterwards likewise, upon the same notion, gives a\r\nview of the Trojan heroes who lived in former ages, amidst a visionary\r\nscene of chariots and arms, flowery meadows, shining spears, and\r\ngenerous steeds, which he tells us were their pleasures upon earth, and\r\nnow make up their happiness in Elysium. For the same reason also, he\r\nmentions others as singing pæans, and songs of triumph, amidst a\r\nbeautiful grove of laurel. The chief of the concert was the poet Musæus,\r\nwho stood enclosed with a circle of admirers, and rose by the head and\r\nshoulders above the throng of shades that surrounded him. The\r\nhabitations of unhappy spirits, to show the duration of their torments,\r\nand the desperate condition they are in, are represented as guarded by a\r\nfury, moated round with a lake of fire, strengthened with towers of\r\niron, encompassed with a triple wall, and fortified with pillars of\r\nadamant, which all the gods together are not able to heave from their\r\nfoundations. The noise of stripes, the clank of chains, and the groans\r\nof the tortured, strike the pious Æneas with a kind of horror. The poet\r\nafterwards divides the criminals into two classes: the first and\r\nblackest catalogue consists of such as were guilty of outrages against\r\nthe gods; and the next, of such who were convicted of injustice between\r\nman and man: the greatest number of whom, says the poet, are those who\r\nfollowed the dictates of avarice.\r\n\r\nIt was an opinion of the Platonists, that the souls of men having\r\ncontracted in the body great stains and pollutions of vice and\r\nignorance, there were several purgations and cleansings necessary to be\r\npassed through both here and hereafter, in order to refine and purify\r\nthem.[188]\r\n\r\nVirgil, to give this thought likewise a clothing of poetry, describes\r\nsome spirits as bleaching in the winds, others as cleansing under great\r\nfalls of waters, and others as purging in fire to recover the primitive\r\nbeauty and purity of their natures.\r\n\r\nIt was likewise an opinion of the same sect of philosophers, that the\r\nsouls of all men exist in a separate state, long before their union with\r\ntheir bodies; and that upon their immersion into flesh, they forget\r\neverything which passed in the state of pre-existence; so that what we\r\nhere call knowledge, is nothing else but memory, or the recovery of\r\nthose things which we knew before.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this scheme, Virgil gives us a view of several souls,\r\nwho, to prepare themselves for living upon earth, flock about the banks\r\nof the river Lethe, and swill themselves with the waters of oblivion.\r\n\r\nThe same scheme gives him an opportunity of making a noble compliment to\r\nhis countrymen, where Anchises is represented taking a survey of the\r\nlong train of heroes that are to descend from him, and giving his son,\r\nÆneas an account of all the glories of his race.\r\n\r\nI need not mention the revolution of the platonic year,[189] which is\r\nbut just touched upon in this book; and as I have consulted no author's\r\nthoughts in this explication, shall be very well pleased, if it can make\r\nthe noblest piece of the most accomplished poet more agreeable to my\r\nfemale readers, when they think fit to look into Dryden's translation of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 184: See No. 157.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 185: \"Hath placed\" (folio).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 186: \"Pale shadows\" (folio).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 187: See No. 133.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 188: \"Purify the soul from ignorance and vice\" (folio).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 189: The Great or Platonic Year is the time in which the fixed\r\nstars make their revolution.

He was a very early riser, and was often abroad\r\ntwo or three hours before any of his neighbours. He had a particular\r\ncarefulness in the knitting of his brows, and a kind of impatience in\r\nall his motions, that plainly discovered he was always intent on matters\r\nof importance. Upon my inquiry into his life and conversation, I found\r\nhim to be the greatest newsmonger in our quarter; that he rose before\r\nday to read the _Postman_; and that he would take two or three turns to\r\nthe other end of the town before his neighbours were up, to see if there\r\nwere any Dutch mails come in. He had a wife and several children; but\r\nwas much more inquisitive to know what passed in Poland than in his own\r\nfamily, and was in greater pain and anxiety of mind for King Augustus'\r\nwelfare than that of his nearest relations. He looked extremely thin in\r\na dearth of news, and never enjoyed himself in a westerly wind. This\r\nindefatigable kind of life was the ruin of his shop; for about the time\r\nthat his favourite prince left the crown of Poland, he broke and\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nThis man and his affairs had been long out of my mind, till about three\r\ndays ago, as I was walking in St. James's Park, I heard somebody at a\r\ndistance hemming after me: and who should it be but my old neighbour the\r\nupholsterer! I saw he was reduced to extreme poverty, by certain shabby\r\nsuperfluities in his dress: for notwithstanding that it was a very\r\nsultry day for the time of the year, he wore a loose great-coat and a\r\nmuff, with a long campaign-wig out of curl; to which he had added the\r\nornament of a pair of black garters buckled under the knee. Upon his\r\ncoming up to me, I was going to inquire into his present circumstances;\r\nbut was prevented by his asking me, with a whisper, whether the last\r\nletters brought any accounts that one might rely upon from Bender? I\r\ntold him, none that I heard of; and asked him, whether he had yet\r\nmarried his eldest daughter? He told me, No. \"But pray,\" says he, \"tell\r\nme sincerely, what are your thoughts of the King of Sweden?\" For though\r\nhis wife and children were starving, I found his chief concern at\r\npresent was for this great monarch. I told him, that I looked upon him\r\nas one of the first heroes of the age. \"But pray,\" says he, \"do you\r\nthink there is anything in the story of his wound?\" And finding me\r\nsurprised at the question, \"Nay,\" says he, \"I only propose it to you.\" I\r\nanswered, that I thought there was no reason to doubt of it. \"But why in\r\nthe heel,\" says he, \"more than in any other part of the body?\"\r\n\"Because,\" says I, \"the bullet chanced to light there.\"\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary dialogue was no sooner ended, but he began to launch\r\nout into a long dissertation upon the affairs of the North; and after\r\nhaving spent some time on them, he told me, he was in a great perplexity\r\nhow to reconcile the _Supplement_ with the _English Post_, and had been\r\njust now examining what the other papers say upon the same subject. \"The\r\n_Daily Courant_,\" says he, \"has these words, 'We have advices from very\r\ngood hands, that a certain prince has some matters of great importance\r\nunder consideration.' This is very mysterious; but the _Postboy_ leaves\r\nus more in the dark, for he tells us, that there are private intimations\r\nof measures taken by a certain prince, which time will bring to light.\r\nNow the _Postman_,\" says he, \"who used to be very clear, refers to the\r\nsame news in these words: 'The late conduct of a certain prince affords\r\ngreat matter of speculation.' This certain prince,\" says the\r\nupholsterer, \"whom they are all so cautious of naming, I take to\r\nbe\"----. Upon which, though there was nobody near us, he whispered\r\nsomething in my ear, which I did not hear, or think worth my while to\r\nmake him repeat.\r\n\r\nWe were now got to the upper end of the Mall, where were three or four\r\nvery odd fellows sitting together upon the bench. These I found were all\r\nof them politicians, who used to sun themselves in that place every day\r\nabout dinner-time. Observing them to be curiosities in their kind, and\r\nmy friend's acquaintance, I sat down among them.\r\n\r\nThe chief politician of the bench was a great asserter of paradoxes. He\r\ntold us, with a seeming concern, that by some news he had lately read\r\nfrom Muscovy, it appeared to him that there was a storm gathering in the\r\nBlack Sea, which might in time do hurt to the naval forces of this\r\nnation. To this he added, that for his part, he could not wish to see\r\nthe Turk driven out of Europe, which he believed could not but be\r\nprejudicial to our woollen manufacture. He then told us, that he looked\r\nupon those extraordinary revolutions which had lately happened in these\r\nparts of the world, to have risen chiefly from two persons who were not\r\nmuch talked of; \"and those,\" says he, \"are Prince Menzikoff and the\r\nDuchess of Mirandola.\" He backed his assertions with so many broken\r\nhints, and such a show of depth and wisdom, that we gave ourselves up to\r\nhis opinions.\r\n\r\nThe discourse at length fell upon a point which seldom escapes a knot of\r\ntrue-born Englishmen, whether in case of a religious war, the\r\nProtestants would not be too strong for the Papists? This we unanimously\r\ndetermined on the Protestant side. One who sat on my right hand, and, as\r\nI found by his discourse, had been in the West Indies, assured us, that\r\nit would be a very easy matter for the Protestants to beat the Pope at\r\nsea; and added, that whenever such a war does break out, it must turn to\r\nthe good of the Leeward Islands. Upon this, one who sat at the end of\r\nthe bench, and, as I afterwards found, was the geographer of the\r\ncompany, said, that in case the Papists should drive the Protestants\r\nfrom these parts of Europe, when the worst came to the worst, it would\r\nbe impossible to beat them out of Norway and Greenland, provided the\r\nNorthern crowns hold together, and the Czar of Muscovy stand neuter.\r\n\r\nHe further told us for our comfort, that there were vast tracts of land\r\nabout the Pole, inhabited neither by Protestants nor Papists, and of\r\ngreater extent than all the Roman Catholic dominions in Europe.\r\n\r\nWhen we had fully discussed this point, my friend the upholsterer began\r\nto exert himself upon the present negotiations of peace, in which he\r\ndeposed princes, settled the bounds of kingdoms, and balanced the power\r\nof Europe, with great justice and impartiality.\r\n\r\nI at length took my leave of the company, and was going away; but had\r\nnot been gone thirty yards, before the upholsterer hemmed again after\r\nme. Upon his advancing towards me, with a whisper, I expected to hear\r\nsome secret piece of news which he had not thought fit to communicate to\r\nthe bench; but instead of that, he desired me in my ear to lend him half\r\na crown. In compassion to so needy a statesman, and to dissipate the\r\nconfusion I found he was in, I told him, if he pleased, I would give him\r\nfive shillings, to receive five pounds of him when the Great Turk was\r\ndriven out of Constantinople; which he very readily accepted, but not\r\nbefore he had laid down to me the impossibility of such an event, as the\r\naffairs of Europe now stand.\r\n\r\nThis paper I design for the particular benefit of those worthy citizens\r\nwho live more in a coffee-house than in their shops, and whose thoughts\r\nare so taken up with the affairs of the Allies, that they forget their\r\ncustomers.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 190: The original of the Political Upholsterer of Nos. 155,\r\n160 and 178 is said to have been an Edward Arne, of Covent Garden.

The story of Telemachus is formed altogether in\r\nthe spirit of Homer, and will give an unlearned reader a notion of that\r\ngreat poet's manner of writing, more than any translation of him can\r\npossibly do. As it was written for the instruction of a young prince,\r\nwho may one day sit upon the throne of France, the author took care to\r\nsuit the several parts of his story, and particularly the description we\r\nare now entering upon, to the character and quality of his pupil. For\r\nwhich reason, he insists very much on the misery of bad, and the\r\nhappiness of good kings, in the account he has given of punishments and\r\nrewards in the other world.\r\n\r\nWe may however observe, notwithstanding the endeavours of this great and\r\nlearned author to copy after the style and sentiments of Homer, that\r\nthere is a certain tincture of Christianity running through the whole\r\nrelation. The prelate in several places mixes himself with the poet; so\r\nthat his future state puts me in mind of Michael Angelo's \"Last\r\nJudgment,\" where Charon and his boat are represented as bearing a part\r\nin the dreadful solemnities of that great day.\r\n\r\nTelemachus, after having passed through the dark avenues of death in the\r\nretinue of Mercury, who every day delivers up a certain tale of ghosts\r\nto the ferryman of Styx, is admitted into the infernal bark. Among the\r\ncompanions of his voyage, is the shade of Nabopharzon, a king of\r\nBabylon, and tyrant of all the East. Among the ceremonies and pomps of\r\nhis funeral, there were four slaves sacrificed, according to the custom\r\nof the country, in order to attend him among the shades. The author\r\nhaving described this tyrant in the most odious colours of pride,\r\ninsolence, and cruelty, tells us, that his four slaves, instead of\r\nserving him after death, were perpetually insulting him with reproaches\r\nand affronts for his past usage; that they spurned him as he lay upon\r\nthe ground, and forced him to show his face, which he would fain have\r\ncovered, as lying under all the confusions of guilt and infamy; and in\r\nshort, that they kept him bound in a chain, in order to drag him before\r\nthe tribunal of the dead.\r\n\r\nTelemachus, upon looking out of the bark, sees all the strand covered\r\nwith an innumerable multitude of shades, who, upon his jumping ashore,\r\nimmediately vanished. He then pursues his course to the palace of Pluto,\r\nwho is described as seated on his throne in terrible majesty, with\r\nProserpine by his side. At the foot of his throne was the pale hideous\r\nspectre, who, by the ghastliness of his visage, and the nature of the\r\napparitions that surrounded him, discovers himself to be Death. His\r\nattendants are, Melancholy, Distrust, Revenge, Hatred, Avarice, Despair,\r\nAmbition, Envy, Impiety, with frightful Dreams, and waking Cares, which\r\nare all drawn very naturally in proper actions and postures. The author,\r\nwith great beauty, places near his Frightful Dreams an assembly of\r\nphantoms, which are often employed to terrify the living, by appearing\r\nin the shape and likeness of the dead.\r\n\r\nThe young hero in the next place takes a survey of the different kinds\r\nof criminals that lay in torture among clouds of sulphur and torrents of\r\nfire. The first of these were such as had been guilty of impieties,\r\nwhich every one has a horror for: to which is added, a catalogue of such\r\noffenders that scarce appear to be faulty in the eyes of the vulgar.\r\nAmong these, says the author, are malicious critics, that have\r\nendeavoured to cast a blemish upon the perfections of others; with whom\r\nhe likewise places such as have often hurt the reputation of the\r\ninnocent, by passing a rash judgment on their actions, without knowing\r\nthe occasion of them. These crimes, says he, are more severely punished\r\nafter death, because they generally meet with impunity upon earth.\r\n\r\nTelemachus, after having taken a survey of several other wretches in the\r\nsame circumstances, arrives at that region of torments in which wicked\r\nkings are punished. There are very fine strokes of imagination in the\r\ndescription which he gives of this unhappy multitude. He tells us, that\r\non one side of them there stood a revengeful fury, thundering in their\r\nears incessant repetitions of all the crimes they had committed upon\r\nearth, with the aggravations of ambition, vanity, hardness of heart, and\r\nall those secret affections of mind that enter into the composition of a\r\ntyrant. At the same time, she holds up to them a large mirror, in which\r\nevery one sees himself represented in the natural horror and deformity\r\nof his character. On the other side of them stands another fury, that\r\nwith an insulting derision repeats to them all the praises that their\r\nflatterers had bestowed upon them while they sat upon their respective\r\nthrones. She too, says the author, presents a mirror before their eyes,\r\nin which every one sees himself adorned with all those beauties and\r\nperfections in which they had been drawn by the vanity of their own\r\nhearts, and the flattery of others. To punish them for the wantonness of\r\nthe cruelty which they formerly exercised, they are now delivered up to\r\nbe treated according to the fancy and caprice of several slaves, who\r\nhave here an opportunity of tyrannising in their turns.\r\n\r\nThe author having given us a description of these ghastly spectres, who,\r\nsays he, are always calling upon Death, and are placed under the\r\ndistillation of that burning vengeance which falls upon them drop by\r\ndrop, and is never to be exhausted, leads us into a pleasing scene of\r\ngroves, filled with the melody of birds, and the odours of a thousand\r\ndifferent plants. These groves are represented as rising among a great\r\nmany flowery meadows, and watered with streams that diffuse a perpetual\r\nfreshness, in the midst of an eternal day, and a never-fading spring.\r\nThis, says the author, was the habitation of those good princes who were\r\nfriends of the gods, and parents of the people. Among these, Telemachus\r\nconverses with the shade of one of his ancestors, who makes a most\r\nagreeable relation of the joys of Elysium, and the nature of its\r\ninhabitants. The residence of Sesostris among these happy shades, with\r\nhis character and present employment, is drawn in a very lively manner,\r\nand with a great elevation of thought.\r\n\r\nThe description of that pure and gentle light which overflows these\r\nhappy regions, and clothes the spirits of these virtuous persons, has\r\nsomething in it of that enthusiasm which this author was accused of by\r\nhis enemies in the Church of Rome; but however it may look in religion,\r\nit makes a very beautiful figure in poetry.\r\n\r\nThe rays of the sun, says he, are darkness in comparison with this\r\nlight, which rather deserves the name of glory, than that of light. It\r\npierces the thickest bodies, in the same manner as the sunbeams pass\r\nthrough crystal: it strengthens the sight instead of dazzling it; and\r\nnourishes in the most inward recesses of the mind, a perpetual serenity\r\nthat is not to be expressed. It enters and incorporates itself with the\r\nvery substance of the soul: the spirits of the blessed feel it in all\r\ntheir senses, and in all their perceptions. It produces a certain source\r\nof peace and joy that arises in them for ever, running through all the\r\nfaculties, and refreshing all the desires of the soul. External\r\npleasures and delights, with all their charms and allurements, are\r\nregarded with the utmost indifference and neglect by these happy spirits\r\nwho have this great principle of pleasure within them, drawing the\r\nwhole mind to itself, calling off their attention from the most\r\ndelightful objects, and giving them all the transports of inebriation,\r\nwithout the confusion and the folly of it.\r\n\r\nI have here only mentioned some master-touches of this admirable piece,\r\nbecause the original itself is understood by the greater part of my\r\nreaders. I must confess, I take a particular delight in these prospects\r\nof futurity, whether grounded upon the probable suggestions of a fine\r\nimagination, or the more severe conclusions of philosophy; as a man\r\nloves to hear all the discoveries or conjectures relating to a foreign\r\ncountry which he is, at some time, to inhabit. Prospects of this nature\r\nlighten the burden of any present evil, and refresh us under the worst\r\nand lowest circumstances of mortality. They extinguish in us both the\r\nfear and envy of human grandeur. Insolence shrinks its head, Power\r\ndisappears; Pain, Poverty and Death fly before them. In short, the mind\r\nthat is habituated to the lively sense of a hereafter, can hope for what\r\nis the most terrifying to the generality of mankind, and rejoice in what\r\nis the most afflicting.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 191: See No. 152.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 192: Fénelon's \"Télémaque.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 157.

How I came among\r\nthem is of no great importance to the reader. I shall only let him know,\r\nthat I was betrayed into so good company by the device of an old\r\nfriend, who had promised to give some of his female acquaintance a sight\r\nof Mr. Bickerstaff. Upon hearing my name mentioned, a lady who sat by me\r\ntold me, they had brought together a female concert for my\r\nentertainment. \"You must know,\" says she, \"that we all of us look upon\r\nourselves to be musical instruments,[194] though we do not yet know of\r\nwhat kind, which we hope to learn from you, if you will give us leave to\r\nplay before you.\" This was followed by a general laugh, which I always\r\nlook upon as a necessary flourish in the opening of a female concert.\r\nThey then struck up together, and played a whole hour upon two grounds,\r\nviz., the Trial,[195] and the Opera. I could not but observe, that\r\nseveral of their notes were more soft, and several more sharp, than any\r\nthat ever I heard in a male concert; though I must confess, there was\r\nnot any regard to time, nor any of those rests and pauses which are\r\nfrequent in the harmony of the other sex: besides, that the music was\r\ngenerally full, and no particular instrument permitted to play long by\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nI seemed so very well pleased with what every one said, and smiled with\r\nso much compliance at all their pretty fancies, that though I did not\r\nput one word into their discourse, I have the vanity to think they\r\nlooked upon me as very agreeable company. I then told them, that if I\r\nwere to draw the picture of so many charming musicians, it should be\r\nlike one I had seen of the Muses, with their several instruments in\r\ntheir hands. Upon which the lady kettledrum tossed back her head, and\r\ncried, \"A very pretty simile!\" The concert again revived; in which, with\r\nnods, smiles, and approbations, I bore the part rather of one who beats\r\nthe time, than of a performer.\r\n\r\nI was no sooner retired to my lodgings, but I ran over in my thoughts\r\nthe several characters of this fair assembly, which I shall give some\r\naccount of, because they are various in their kind, and may each of them\r\nstand as a sample of a whole species.\r\n\r\nThe person who pleased me most was a flute, an instrument that, without\r\nany great compass, has something exquisitely sweet and soft in its\r\nsound: it lulls and soothes the ear, and fills it with such a gentle\r\nkind of melody, as keeps the mind awake without startling it, and raises\r\na most agreeable passion between transport and indolence. In short, the\r\nmusic of the flute is the conversation of a mild and amiable woman, that\r\nhas nothing in it very elevated, or at the same time anything mean or\r\ntrivial.\r\n\r\nI must here observe, that the hautboy is the most perfect of the flute\r\nspecies, which, with all the sweetness of the sound, has a great\r\nstrength and variety of notes; though at the same time I must observe,\r\nthat the hautboy in one sex is as scarce as the harpsichord in the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nBy the side of the flute there sat a flageolet, for so I must call a\r\ncertain young lady, who fancied herself a wit, despised the music of the\r\nflute as low and insipid, and would be entertaining the company with\r\ntart ill-natured observations, pert fancies, and little turns, which she\r\nimagined to be full of life and spirit. The flageolet therefore does not\r\ndiffer from the flute so much in the compass of its notes, as in the\r\nshrillness and sharpness of the sound. We must however take notice, that\r\nthe flageolets among their own sex are more valued and esteemed than the\r\nflutes.\r\n\r\nThere chanced to be a coquette in the concert, that with a great many\r\nskittish notes, affected squeaks, and studied inconsistencies,\r\ndistinguished herself from the rest of the company. She did not speak a\r\nword during the whole trial; but I thought she would never have done\r\nupon the opera. One while she would break out upon, \"That hideous king!\"\r\nthen upon the \"charming blackmoor!\" Then, \"Oh that dear lion!\" Then\r\nwould hum over two or three notes; then run to the window to see what\r\ncoach was coming. The coquette therefore I must distinguish by that\r\nmusical instrument which is commonly known by the name of a kit, that is\r\nmore jiggish than the fiddle itself, and never sounds but to a dance.\r\n\r\nThe fourth person who bore a part in the conversation was a prude, who\r\nstuck to the trial, and was silent upon the whole opera. The gravity of\r\nher censures, and composure of her voice, which were often attended with\r\nsupercilious casts of the eye, and a seeming contempt for the lightness\r\nof the conversation, put me in mind of that ancient serious matronlike\r\ninstrument the virginal.\r\n\r\nI must not pass over in silence a Lancashire hornpipe, by which I would\r\nsignify a young country lady, who with a great deal of mirth and\r\ninnocence diverted the company very agreeably; and, if I am not\r\nmistaken, by that time the wildness of her notes is a little softened,\r\nand the redundancy of her music restrained by conversation and good\r\ncompany, will be improved into one of the most amiable flutes about the\r\ntown. Your romps and boarding-school girls fall likewise under this\r\ndenomination.\r\n\r\nOn the right hand of the hornpipe sat a Welsh harp, an instrument which\r\nvery much delights in the tunes of old historical ballads, and in\r\ncelebrating the renowned actions and exploits of ancient British heroes.\r\nBy this instrument I therefore would describe a certain lady, who is one\r\nof those female historians that upon all occasions enters into pedigrees\r\nand descents, and finds herself related, by some offshoot or other, to\r\nalmost every great family in England: for which reason she jars and is\r\nout of tune very often in conversation, for the company's want of due\r\nattention and respect to her.\r\n\r\nBut the most sonorous part of our concert was a shedrum, or (as the\r\nvulgar call it) a kettledrum, who accompanied her discourse with motions\r\nof the body, tosses of the head, and brandishes of the fan. Her music\r\nwas loud, bold, and masculine. Every thump she gave, alarmed the\r\ncompany, and very often set somebody or other in it a-blushing.\r\n\r\nThe last I shall mention was a certain romantic instrument called a\r\ndulcimer, who talked of nothing but shady woods, flowery meadows,\r\npurling streams, larks and nightingales, with all the beauties of the\r\nspring, and the pleasures of a country life. This instrument has a fine\r\nmelancholy sweetness in it, and goes very well with the flute.\r\n\r\nI think most of the conversable part of womankind may be found under one\r\nof the foregoing divisions; but it must be confessed, that the\r\ngenerality of that sex, notwithstanding they have naturally a great\r\ngenius for being talkative, are not mistresses of more than one note;\r\nwith which however, by frequent repetition, they make a greater sound\r\nthan those who are possessed of the whole gamut, as may be observed in\r\nyour larums or household scolds, and in your castanets or impertinent\r\ntittle-tattles, who have no other variety in their discourse but that of\r\ntalking slower or faster.\r\n\r\nUpon communicating this scheme of music to an old friend of mine, who\r\nwas formerly a man of gallantry and a rover, he told me, that he\r\nbelieved he had been in love with every instrument in my concert. The\r\nfirst that smit him was a hornpipe, who lived near his father's house in\r\nthe country; but upon his failing to meet her at an assize, according to\r\nappointment, she cast him off. His next passion was for a kettledrum,\r\nwhom he fell in love with at a play; but when he became acquainted with\r\nher, not finding the softness of her sex in her conversation, he grew\r\ncool to her; though at the same time he could not deny, but that she\r\nbehaved herself very much like a gentlewoman. His third mistress was a\r\ndulcimer, who he found took great delight in sighing and languishing,\r\nbut would go no farther than the preface of matrimony; so that she would\r\nnever let a lover have any more of her than her heart, which, after\r\nhaving won, he was forced to leave her, as despairing of any further\r\nsuccess. \"I must confess,\" says my friend, \"I have often considered her\r\nwith a great deal of admiration; and I find her pleasure is so much in\r\nthis first step of an amour, that her life will pass away in dream,\r\nsolitude, and soliloquy, till her decay of charms makes her snatch at\r\nthe worst man that ever pretended to her. In the next place,\" says my\r\nfriend, \"I fell in love with a kit,[196] who led me such a dance through\r\nall the varieties of a familiar, cold, fond, and indifferent behaviour,\r\nthat the world began to grow censorious, though without any cause: for\r\nwhich reason, to recover our reputations, we parted by consent. To mend\r\nmy hand,\" says he, \"I made my next application to a virginal, who gave\r\nme great encouragement, after her cautious manner, till some malicious\r\ncompanion told her of my long passion for the kit, which made her turn\r\nme off as a scandalous fellow. At length, in despair,\" says he, \"I\r\nbetook myself to a Welsh harp, who rejected me with contempt, after\r\nhaving found that my great-grandmother was a brewer's daughter.\" I found\r\nby the sequel of my friend's discourse, that he had never aspired to a\r\nhautboy; that he had been exasperated by a flageolet; and that to this\r\nvery day, he pines away for a flute.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, having thoroughly considered how absolutely necessary it\r\nis, that two instruments, which are to play together for life, should be\r\nexactly tuned, and go in perfect concert with each other, I would\r\npropose matches between the music of both sexes, according to the\r\nfollowing table of marriage:\r\n\r\n     1. Drum and kettledrum.\r\n     2. Lute and flute.\r\n     3. Harpsichord and hautboy.\r\n     4. Violin and flageolet.\r\n     5. Bass-viol and kit.\r\n     6. Trumpet and Welsh harp.\r\n     7. Hunting-horn and hornpipe.\r\n     8. Bagpipe and castanets.\r\n     9. Passing-bell and virginal.\r\n\r\nMr. Bickerstaff, in consideration of his ancient friendship and\r\nacquaintance with Mr. Betterton,[197] and great esteem for his merit,\r\nsummons all his disciples, whether dead or living, mad or tame, Toasts,\r\nSmarts, Dappers, Pretty Fellows, Musicians or Scrapers, to make their\r\nappearance at the playhouse in the Haymarket on Thursday next; when\r\nthere will be a play acted for the benefit of the said Mr. Betterton.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 193: This paper is not included in Tickell's edition of\r\nAddison's Works; but Steele ascribes it to Addison in his Dedication of\r\n\"The Drummer\" to Congreve.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 194: See No. 153.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 195: The trial of Dr. Sacheverell.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 196: See Nos. 34 and 160.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 197: See Nos. 1, 71, 167.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 158.

There is not a sale of\r\nbooks begins till Tom Folio is seen at the door. There is not an auction\r\nwhere his name is not heard, and that too in the very nick of time, in\r\nthe critical moment, before the last decisive stroke of the hammer.\r\nThere is not a subscription goes forward, in which Tom is not privy to\r\nthe first rough draught of the proposals; nor a catalogue printed, that\r\ndoes not come to him wet from the press. He is an universal scholar, so\r\nfar as the title-page of all authors, knows the manuscripts in which\r\nthey were discovered, the editions through which they have passed, with\r\nthe praises or censures which they have received from the several\r\nmembers of the learned world. He has a greater esteem for Aldus and\r\nElzevir, than for Virgil and Horace. If you talk of Herodotus, he breaks\r\nout into a panegyric upon Harry Stephans. He thinks he gives you an\r\naccount of an author, when he tells you the subject he treats of, the\r\nname of the editor, and the year in which it was printed. Or if you draw\r\nhim into further particulars, he cries up the goodness of the paper,\r\nextols the diligence of the corrector, and is transported with the\r\nbeauty of the letter. This he looks upon to be sound learning and\r\nsubstantial criticism. As for those who talk of the fineness of style,\r\nand the justness of thought, or describe the brightness of any\r\nparticular passages; nay, though they write themselves in the genius and\r\nspirit of the author they admire, Tom looks upon them as men of\r\nsuperficial learning, and flashy parts.\r\n\r\nI had yesterday morning a visit from this learned idiot (for that is the\r\nlight in which I consider every pedant), when I discovered in him some\r\nlittle touches of the coxcomb which I had not before observed. Being\r\nvery full of the figure which he makes in the republic of letters, and\r\nwonderfully satisfied with his great stock of knowledge, he gave me\r\nbroad intimations, that he did not \"believe\" in all points as his\r\nforefathers had done. He then communicated to me a thought of a certain\r\nauthor upon a passage of Virgil's account of the dead, which I made the\r\nsubject of a late paper.[199] This thought has taken very much among men\r\nof Tom's pitch and understanding, though universally exploded by all\r\nthat know how to construe Virgil, or have any relish of antiquity. Not\r\nto trouble my reader with it, I found upon the whole, that Tom did not\r\nbelieve a future state of rewards and punishments, because Æneas, at his\r\nleaving the empire of the dead, passed through the gate of ivory, and\r\nnot through that of horn. Knowing that Tom had not sense enough to give\r\nup an opinion which he had once received, that he might avoid wrangling,\r\nI told him, that Virgil possibly had his oversights as well as another\r\nauthor. \"Ah! Mr. Bickerstaff,\" says he, \"you would have another opinion\r\nof him, if you would read him in Daniel Heinsius' edition. I have\r\nperused him myself several times in that edition,\" continued he; \"and\r\nafter the strictest and most malicious examination, could find but two\r\nfaults in him: one of them is in the 'Æneids,' where there are two\r\ncommas instead of a parenthesis; and another in the third 'Georgic,'\r\nwhere you may find a semicolon turned upside down.\" \"Perhaps,\" said I,\r\n\"these were not Virgil's thoughts, but those of the transcriber.\" \"I do\r\nnot design it,\" says Tom, \"as a reflection on Virgil: on the contrary, I\r\nknow that all the manuscripts 'reclaim' against such a punctuation. Oh!\r\nMr. Bickerstaff,\" says he, \"what would a man give to see one simile of\r\nVirgil writ in his own hand?\" I asked him which was the simile he meant;\r\nbut was answered, \"Any simile in Virgil.\" He then told me all the secret\r\nhistory in the commonwealth of learning; of modern pieces that had the\r\nnames of ancient authors annexed to them; of all the books that were now\r\nwriting or printing in the several parts of Europe; of many amendments\r\nwhich are made, and not yet published; and a thousand other particulars,\r\nwhich I would not have my memory burdened with for a Vatican.\r\n\r\nAt length, being fully persuaded that I thoroughly admired him, and\r\nlooked upon him as a prodigy of learning, he took his leave. I know\r\nseveral of Tom's class who are professed admirers of Tasso without\r\nunderstanding a word of Italian; and one in particular, that carries a\r\n\"Pastor Fido\" in his pocket, in which I am sure he is acquainted with no\r\nother beauty but the clearness of the character.\r\n\r\nThere is another kind of pedant, who, with all Tom Folio's\r\nimpertinences, has greater superstructures and embellishments of Greek\r\nand Latin, and is still more unsupportable than the other, in the same\r\ndegree as he is more learned. Of this kind very often are editors,\r\ncommentators, interpreters, scholiasts, and critics; and in short, all\r\nmen of deep learning without common sense. These persons set a greater\r\nvalue on themselves for having found out the meaning of a passage in\r\nGreek, than upon the author for having written it; nay, will allow the\r\npassage itself not to have any beauty in it, at the same time that they\r\nwould be considered as the greatest men of the age for having\r\ninterpreted it. They will look with contempt upon the most beautiful\r\npoems that have been composed by any of their contemporaries; but will\r\nlock themselves up in their studies for a twelvemonth together, to\r\ncorrect, publish, and expound, such trifles of antiquity as a modern\r\nauthor would be contemned for. Men of the strictest morals, severest\r\nlives, and the gravest professions, will write volumes upon an idle\r\nsonnet that is originally in Greek or Latin; give editions of the most\r\nimmoral authors, and spin out whole pages upon the various readings of a\r\nlewd expression. All that can be said in excuse for them, is, that their\r\nworks sufficiently show they have no taste of their authors; and that\r\nwhat they do in this kind, is out of their great learning, and not out\r\nof any levity or lasciviousness of temper.\r\n\r\nA pedant of this nature is wonderfully well described in six lines of\r\nBoileau,[200] with which I shall conclude his character:\r\n\r\n      \"_Un Pédant enivré de sa vaine science,\r\n    Tout hérissé de grec, tout bouffi d'arrogance,\r\n    Et qui, de mille auteurs retenus mot pour mot,\r\n    Dans sa tête entassés, n'a souvent fait qu'un sot,\r\n    Croit qu'un livre fait tout, et que, sans Aristote,\r\n    La raison ne voit goutte, et le bon sens radote._\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 198: The original of Tom Folio is supposed to be Thomas\r\nRawlinson, a great book-collector, who lived in Gray's Inn, and\r\nafterwards in London House, Aldersgate Street, where he died, August 6,\r\n1725, aged 44.

Marriage has been one of the common topics of ridicule that every\r\nstage-scribbler has found his account in; for whenever there is an\r\noccasion for a clap, an impertinent jest upon matrimony is sure to raise\r\nit. This has been attended with very pernicious consequences. Many a\r\ncountry squire, upon his setting up for a man of the town, has gone home\r\nin the gaiety of his heart and beat his wife. A kind husband has been\r\nlooked upon as a clown, and a good wife as a domestic animal, unfit for\r\nthe company or conversation of the _beau monde_. In short, separate\r\nbeds, silent tables, and solitary homes have been introduced by your men\r\nof wit and pleasure of the age.\r\n\r\nAs I shall always make it my business to stem the torrents of prejudice\r\nand vice, I shall take particular care to put an honest father of a\r\nfamily in countenance, and endeavour to remove all the evils out of that\r\nstate of life, which is either the most happy, or most miserable, that a\r\nman can be placed in. In order to this, let us, if you please, consider\r\nthe wits and well-bred persons of former times. I have shown in another\r\npaper,[201] that Pliny, who was a man of the greatest genius, as well as\r\nof the first quality of his age, did not think it below him to be a\r\nkind husband, and to treat his wife as a friend, companion and\r\ncounsellor. I shall give the like instance of another, who in all\r\nrespects was a much greater man than Pliny, and has written a whole book\r\nof letters to his wife. They are not so full of turns as those\r\ntranslated out of the former author, who writes very much like a modern,\r\nbut are full of that beautiful simplicity which is altogether natural,\r\nand is the distinguishing character of the best ancient writers. The\r\nauthor I am speaking of, is Cicero; who, in the following passages which\r\nI have taken out of his letters,[202] shows, that he did not think it\r\ninconsistent with the politeness of his manners, or the greatness of his\r\nwisdom, to stand upon record in his domestic character.\r\n\r\nThese letters were written at a time when he was banished from his\r\ncountry, by a faction that then prevailed at Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Cicero to Terentia._\r\n\r\n     I.\r\n\r\n     \"I learn from the letters of my friends, as well as from common\r\n     report, that you give incredible proofs of virtue and fortitude,\r\n     and that you are indefatigable in all kinds of good offices. How\r\n     unhappy a man am I, that a woman of your virtue, constancy, honour,\r\n     and good nature, should fall into so great distresses upon my\r\n     account; and that my dear Tulliola should be so much afflicted for\r\n     the sake of a father, with whom she had once so much reason to be\r\n     pleased! How can I mention little Cicero, whose first knowledge of\r\n     things began with the sense of his own misery? If all this had\r\n     happened by the decrees of fate, as you would kindly persuade me, I\r\n     could have borne it. But, alas! it is all befallen me by my own\r\n     indiscretion, who thought I was beloved by those who envied me, and\r\n     did not join with them who sought my friendship.----At present,\r\n     since my friends bid me hope, I shall take care of my health, that\r\n     I may enjoy the benefit of your affectionate services.----Plancius\r\n     hopes we may some time or other come together into Italy. If I ever\r\n     live to see that day; if I ever return to your dear embraces; in\r\n     short, if I ever again recover you and myself, I shall think our\r\n     conjugal piety very well rewarded.----As for what you write to me\r\n     about selling your estate, consider (my dear Terentia), consider,\r\n     alas! what would be the event of it. If our present fortune\r\n     continues to oppress us, what will become of our poor boy? My tears\r\n     flow so fast, that I am not able to write any further; and I would\r\n     not willingly make you weep with me.----Let us take care not to\r\n     undo the child that is already undone: if we can leave him\r\n     anything, a little virtue will keep him from want, and a little\r\n     fortune raise him in the world. Mind your health, and let me know\r\n     frequently what you are doing.----Remember me to Tulliola and\r\n     Cicero.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     II.\r\n\r\n     \"Don't fancy that I write longer letters to any one than to\r\n     yourself, unless when I chance to receive a longer letter from\r\n     another, which I am indispensably obliged to answer in every\r\n     particular. The truth of it is, I have no subject for a letter at\r\n     present: and as my affairs now stand, there is nothing more painful\r\n     to me than writing. As for you and our dear Tulliola, I cannot\r\n     write to you without abundance of tears, for I see both of you\r\n     miserable, whom I always wished to be happy, and whom I ought to\r\n     have made so.----I must acknowledge, you have done everything for\r\n     me with the utmost fortitude, and the utmost affection; nor indeed\r\n     is it more than I expected from you; though at the same time it is\r\n     a great aggravation of my ill fortune, that the afflictions I\r\n     suffer can be relieved only by those which you undergo for my sake.\r\n     For honest Valerius has written me a letter, which I could not read\r\n     without weeping very bitterly; wherein he gives me an account of\r\n     the public procession which you have made for me at Rome. Alas! my\r\n     dearest life, must then Terentia, the darling of my soul, whose\r\n     favour and recommendations have been so often sought by others;\r\n     must my Terentia droop under the weight of sorrow, appear in the\r\n     habit of a mourner, pour out floods of tears, and all this for my\r\n     sake; for my sake, who have undone my family, by consulting the\r\n     safety of others!----As for what you write about selling your\r\n     house, I am very much afflicted, that what is laid out upon my\r\n     account may any way reduce you to misery and want. If we can bring\r\n     about our design, we may indeed recover everything; but if Fortune\r\n     persists in persecuting us, how can I think of your sacrificing for\r\n     me the poor remainder of your possessions? No, my dearest life, let\r\n     me beg you to let those bear my expenses who are able, and perhaps\r\n     willing to do it; and if you would show your love to me, do not\r\n     injure your health, which is already too much impaired. You present\r\n     yourself before my eyes day and night; I see you labouring amidst\r\n     innumerable difficulties; I am afraid lest you should sink under\r\n     them; but I find in you all the qualifications that are necessary\r\n     to support you: be sure therefore to cherish your health, that you\r\n     may compass the end of your hopes and your endeavours.----Farewell,\r\n     my Terentia, my heart's desire, farewell.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     III.\r\n\r\n     \"Aristocritus has delivered to me three of your letters, which I\r\n     have almost defaced with my tears. Oh! my Terentia, I am consumed\r\n     with grief, and feel the weight of your sufferings more than of my\r\n     own. I am more miserable than you are, notwithstanding you are very\r\n     much so; and that for this reason, because though our calamity is\r\n     common, it is my fault that brought it upon us. I ought to have\r\n     died rather than have been driven out of the city: I am therefore\r\n     overwhelmed not only with grief, but with shame. I am ashamed that\r\n     I did not do my utmost for the best of wives, and the dearest of\r\n     children. You are ever present before my eyes in your mourning,\r\n     your affliction, and your sickness. Amidst all which, there scarce\r\n     appears to me the least glimmering of hope.----However, so long as\r\n     you hope, I will not despair.----I will do what you advise me. I\r\n     have returned my thanks to those friends whom you mentioned, and\r\n     have let them know, that you have acquainted me with their good\r\n     offices. I am sensible of Piso's extraordinary zeal and endeavours\r\n     to serve me. Oh! would the gods grant that you and I might live\r\n     together in the enjoyment of such a son-in-law, and of our dear\r\n     children.----As for what you write of your coming to me if I desire\r\n     it, I would rather you should be where you are, because I know you\r\n     are my principal agent at Rome. If you succeed, I shall come to\r\n     you: if not----. But I need say no more. Be careful of your health,\r\n     and be assured, that nothing is, or ever was, so dear to me as\r\n     yourself. Farewell, my Terentia; I fancy that I see you, and\r\n     therefore cannot command my weakness so far as to refrain from\r\n     tears.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     IV.\r\n\r\n     \"I don't write to you as often as I might, because notwithstanding\r\n     I am afflicted at all times, I am quite overcome with sorrow whilst\r\n     I am writing to you, or reading any letters that I receive from\r\n     you.----If these evils are not to be removed, I must desire to see\r\n     you, my dearest life, as soon as possible, and to die in your\r\n     embraces; since neither the gods, whom you always religiously\r\n     worshipped; nor the men, whose good I always promoted, have\r\n     rewarded us according to our deserts.----What a distressed wretch\r\n     am I! should I ask a weak woman, oppressed with cares and sickness,\r\n     to come and live with me, or shall I not ask her? Can I live\r\n     without you? But I find I must. If there be any hopes of my return,\r\n     help it forward, and promote it as much as you are able. But if all\r\n     that is over, as I fear it is, find out some way or other of coming\r\n     to me. This you may be sure of, that I shall not look upon myself\r\n     as quite undone whilst you are with me. But what will become of\r\n     Tulliola? You must look to that; I must confess, I am entirely at a\r\n     loss about her. Whatever happens, we must take care of the\r\n     reputation and marriage of that dear unfortunate girl. As for\r\n     Cicero, he shall live in my bosom and in my arms. I cannot write\r\n     any further, my sorrows will not let me.----Support yourself, my\r\n     dear Terentia, as well as you are able. We have lived and\r\n     flourished together amidst the greatest honours: it is not our\r\n     crimes, but our virtues that have distressed us.----Take more than\r\n     ordinary care of your health; I am more afflicted with your sorrows\r\n     than my own. Farewell, my Terentia, thou dearest, faithfullest, and\r\n     best of wives.\"\r\n\r\nMethinks it is a pleasure to see this great man in his family, who makes\r\nso different a figure in the Forum or Senate of Rome. Every one admires\r\nthe orator and the consul; but for my part, I esteem the husband and the\r\nfather. His private character, with all the little weaknesses of\r\nhumanity, is as amiable as the figure he makes in public is awful and\r\nmajestic. But at the same time that I love to surprise so great an\r\nauthor in his private walks, and to survey him in his most familiar\r\nlights, I think it would be barbarous to form to ourselves any idea of\r\nmean-spiritedness from these natural openings of his heart, and\r\ndisburdening of his thoughts to a wife. He has written several other\r\nletters to the same person, but none with so great passion as these of\r\nwhich I have given the foregoing extracts.\r\n\r\nIt would be ill-nature not to acquaint the English reader, that his wife\r\nwas successful in her solicitations for this great man, and saw her\r\nhusband return to the honours of which he had been deprived, with all\r\nthe pomp and acclamation that usually attended the greatest triumph.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 201: No. 149.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 202: \"Epist.\" xiv, 1-4.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 160.                                         [ADDISON AND STEELE.\r\n\r\nFrom _Saturday, April 15_, to _Tuesday, April 18, 1710_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, April 17._\r\n\r\nA common civility to an impertinent fellow often draws upon one a great\r\nmany unforeseen troubles; and if one does not take particular care, will\r\nbe interpreted by him as an overture of friendship and intimacy. This I\r\nwas very sensible of this morning. About two hours before day, I heard a\r\ngreat rapping at my door, which continued some time, till my maid could\r\nget herself ready to go down and see what was the occasion of it. She\r\nthen brought me up word, that there was a gentleman who seemed very much\r\nin haste, and said he must needs speak with me. By the description she\r\ngave me of him, and by his voice, which I could hear as I lay in my bed,\r\nI fancied him to be my old acquaintance the upholsterer,[203] whom I met\r\nthe other day in St. James's Park. For which reason, I bid her tell the\r\ngentleman, whoever he was, that I was indisposed, that I could see\r\nnobody, and that, if he had anything to say to me, I desired he would\r\nleave it in writing. My maid, after having delivered her message, told\r\nme that the gentleman said he would stay at the next coffee-house till I\r\nwas stirring, and bid her be sure to tell me, that the French were\r\ndriven from the Scarp, and that Douay was invested. He gave her the name\r\nof another town, which I found she had dropped by the way.\r\n\r\nAs much as I love to be informed of the success of my brave countrymen,\r\nI do not care for hearing of a victory before day, and was therefore\r\nvery much out of humour at this unseasonable visit. I had no sooner\r\nrecovered my temper, and was falling asleep, but I was immediately\r\nstartled by a second rap; and upon my maid's opening the door, heard the\r\nsame voice ask her if her master was yet up; and at the same time bid\r\nher tell me, that he was come on purpose to talk with me about a piece\r\nof home news that everybody in town will be full of two hours hence. I\r\nordered my maid as soon as she came into the room, without hearing her\r\nmessage, to tell the gentleman, that whatever his news was, I would\r\nrather hear it two hours hence than now; and that I persisted in my\r\nresolution not to speak with anybody that morning. The wench delivered\r\nmy answer presently, and shut the door. It was impossible for me to\r\ncompose myself to sleep after two such unexpected alarms; for which\r\nreason I put on my clothes in a very peevish humour. I took several\r\nturns about my chamber, reflecting with a great deal of anger and\r\ncontempt on these volunteers in politics, that undergo all the pain,\r\nwatchfulness, and disquiet of a First Minister, without turning it to\r\nthe advantage either of themselves or their country; and yet it is\r\nsurprising to consider how numerous this species of men is. There is\r\nnothing more frequent than to find a tailor breaking his rest on the\r\naffairs of Europe, and to see a cluster of porters sitting upon the\r\nMinistry. Our streets swarm with politicians, and there is scarce a shop\r\nwhich is not held by a statesman. As I was musing after this manner, I\r\nheard the upholsterer at the door delivering a letter to my maid, and\r\nbegging her, in a very great hurry, to give it to her master as soon as\r\never he was awake, which I opened, and found as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"MR. BICKERSTAFF,\r\n\r\n     \"I was to wait upon you about a week ago, to let you know, that the\r\n     honest gentlemen whom you conversed with upon the bench at the end\r\n     of the Mall, having heard that I had received five shillings of\r\n     you, to give you a hundred pounds upon the Great Turk's being\r\n     driven out of Europe, desired me to acquaint you, that every one of\r\n     that company would be willing to receive five shillings, to pay a\r\n     hundred pounds on the same conditions. Our last advices from\r\n     Muscovy making this a fairer bet than it was a week ago, I do not\r\n     question but you will accept the wager.\r\n\r\n     \"But this is not my present business. If you remember, I whispered\r\n     a word in your ear as we were walking up the Mall, and you see what\r\n     has happened since. If I had seen you this morning, I would have\r\n     told you in your ear another secret. I hope you will be recovered\r\n     of your indisposition by to-morrow morning, when I will wait on you\r\n     at the same hour as I did this; my private circumstances being\r\n     such, that I cannot well appear in this quarter of the town after\r\n     it is day.\r\n\r\n     \"I have been so taken up with the late good news from Holland, and\r\n     expectation of further particulars, as well as with other\r\n     transactions, of which I will tell you more to-morrow morning, that\r\n     I have not slept a wink these three nights.\r\n\r\n     \"I have reason to believe that Picardy will soon follow the example\r\n     of Artois, in case the enemy continue in their present resolution\r\n     of flying away from us. I think I told you last time we were\r\n     together my opinion about the Deulle.\r\n\r\n     \"The honest gentlemen upon the bench bid me tell you, they would be\r\n     glad to see you often among them. We shall be there all the warm\r\n     hours of the day, during the present posture of affairs.\r\n\r\n     \"This happy opening of the campaign will, I hope, give us a very\r\n     joyful summer; and I propose to take many a pleasant walk with you,\r\n     if you will sometimes come into the Park; for that is the only\r\n     place in which I can be free from the malice of my enemies.\r\n     Farewell till three o'clock to-morrow morning. I am,\r\n\r\n                                       \"Your most humble Servant, &c.\r\n\r\n     \"P.S. The King of Sweden is still at Bender.\"\r\n\r\nI should have fretted myself to death at this promise of a second visit,\r\nif I had not found in his letter an intimation of the good news which I\r\nhave since heard at large. I have however ordered my maid to tie up the\r\nknocker of my door in such a manner as she would do if I was really\r\nindisposed. By which means I hope to escape breaking my morning's\r\nrest.[204]\r\n\r\nSince I have given this letter to the public, I shall communicate one or\r\ntwo more, which I have lately received from others of my\r\ncorrespondents. The following is from a Coquette, who is very angry at\r\nmy having disposed of her in marriage to a Bass-viol:[205]\r\n\r\n     \"MR. BICKERSTAFF,\r\n\r\n     \"I thought you would never have descended from the Censor of Great\r\n     Britain, to become a match-maker. But pray, why so severe upon the\r\n     Kit? Had I been a Jews-harp, that is nothing but tongue, you could\r\n     not have used me worse. Of all things, a Bass-viol is my aversion.\r\n     Had you married me to a Bagpipe, or a Passing-bell, I should have\r\n     been better pleased. Dear Father Isaac, either choose me a better\r\n     husband, or I will live and die a Dulcimer. In hopes of receiving\r\n     satisfaction from you, I am yours, whilst\r\n\r\n                                                      \"ISABELLA KIT.\"\r\n\r\nThe pertness which this fair lady has shown in this letter, was one\r\noccasion of my joining her to the Bass-viol, which is an instrument that\r\nwants to be quickened by these little vivacities; as the sprightliness\r\nof the Kit ought to be checked and curbed by the gravity of the\r\nBass-viol.\r\n\r\nMy next letter is from Tom Folio,[206] who it seems takes it amiss that\r\nI have published a character of him so much to his disadvantage:\r\n\r\n     \"SIR,\r\n\r\n     \"I suppose you meant Tom Fool, when you called me Tom Folio in a\r\n     late trifling paper of yours; for I find, it is your design to run\r\n     down all useful and solid learning.

The music of the birds, that filled all the trees\r\nabout me, lulled me asleep before I was aware of it; which was followed\r\nby a dream, that I impute in some measure to the foregoing author, who\r\nhad made an impression upon my imagination, and put me into his own way\r\nof thinking.\r\n\r\nI fancied myself among the Alps, and, as it is natural in a dream,\r\nseemed every moment to bound from one summit to another, till at last,\r\nafter having made this airy progress over the tops of several mountains,\r\nI arrived at the very centre of those broken rocks and precipices. I\r\nhere, methought, saw a prodigious circuit of hills, that reached above\r\nthe clouds, and encompassed a large space of ground, which I had a great\r\ncuriosity to look into. I thereupon continued my former way of\r\ntravelling through a great variety of winter scenes, till I had gained\r\nthe top of these white mountains, which seemed another Alps of snow. I\r\nlooked down from hence into a spacious plain, which was surrounded on\r\nall sides by this mound of hills, and which presented me with the most\r\nagreeable prospect I had ever seen. There was a greater variety of\r\ncolours in the embroidery of the meadows, a more lively green in the\r\nleaves and grass, a brighter crystal in the streams, than what I ever\r\nmet with in any other region. The light itself had something more\r\nshining and glorious in it than that of which the day is made in other\r\nplaces. I was wonderfully astonished at the discovery of such a paradise\r\namidst the wildness of those cold, hoary landscapes which lay about it;\r\nbut found at length, that this happy region was inhabited by the Goddess\r\nof Liberty; whose presence softened the rigours of the climate, enriched\r\nthe barrenness of the soil, and more than supplied the absence of the\r\nsun. The place was covered with a wonderful profusion of flowers, that\r\nwithout being disposed into regular borders and parterres, grew\r\npromiscuously, and had a greater beauty in their natural luxuriancy and\r\ndisorder, than they could have received from the checks and restraints\r\nof art. There was a river that arose out of the south side of the\r\nmountain, that by an infinite number of turns and windings, seemed to\r\nvisit every plant, and cherish the several beauties of the spring, with\r\nwhich the fields abounded. After having run to and fro in a wonderful\r\nvariety of meanders, as unwilling to leave so charming a place, it at\r\nlast throws itself into the hollow of a mountain, from whence it passes\r\nunder a long range of rocks, and at length rises in that part of the\r\nAlps where the inhabitants think it the first source of the Rhone. This\r\nriver, after having made its progress through those free nations,\r\nstagnates in a huge lake,[211] at the leaving of them, and no sooner\r\nenters into the regions of slavery, but runs through them with an\r\nincredible rapidity, and takes its shortest way to the sea.\r\n\r\nI descended into the happy fields that lay beneath me, and in the midst\r\nof them, beheld the goddess sitting upon a throne. She had nothing to\r\nenclose her but the bounds of her own dominions, and nothing over her\r\nhead but the heavens. Every glance of her eye cast a track of light\r\nwhere it fell, that revived the spring, and made all things smile about\r\nher. My heart grew cheerful at the sight of her, and as she looked upon\r\nme, I found a certain confidence growing in me, and such an inward\r\nresolution as I never felt before that time.\r\n\r\nOn the left hand of the goddess sat the Genius of a Commonwealth, with\r\nthe cap of liberty on her head, and in her hand a wand, like that with\r\nwhich a Roman citizen used to give his slaves their freedom. There was\r\nsomething mean and vulgar, but at the same time exceeding bold and\r\ndaring, in her air; her eyes were full of fire, but had in them such\r\ncasts of fierceness and cruelty, as made her appear to me rather\r\ndreadful than amiable. On her shoulder she wore a mantle, on which there\r\nwas wrought a great confusion of figures. As it flew in the wind, I\r\ncould not discern the particular design of them, but saw wounds in the\r\nbodies of some, and agonies in the faces of others; and over one part of\r\nit could read in letters of blood, \"The Ides of March.\"\r\n\r\nOn the right hand of the goddess was the Genius of Monarchy. She was\r\nclothed in the whitest ermine, and wore a crown of the purest gold upon\r\nher head. In her hand she held a sceptre like that which is borne by the\r\nBritish monarchs. A couple of tame lions lay crouching at her feet: her\r\ncountenance had in it a very great majesty without any mixture of\r\nterror: her voice was like the voice of an angel, filled with so much\r\nsweetness, and accompanied with such an air of condescension, as\r\ntempered the awfulness of her appearance, and equally inspired love and\r\nveneration into the hearts of all that beheld her.\r\n\r\nIn the train of the Goddess of Liberty were the several Arts and\r\nSciences, who all of them flourished underneath her eye. One of them in\r\nparticular made a greater figure than any of the rest, who held a\r\nthunderbolt in her hand, which had the power of melting, piercing, or\r\nbreaking everything that stood in its way. The name of this goddess was\r\nEloquence.\r\n\r\nThere were two other dependent goddesses, who made a very conspicuous\r\nfigure in this blissful region. The first of them was seated upon a\r\nhill, that had every plant growing out of it, which the soil was in its\r\nown nature capable of producing. The other was seated in a little\r\nisland, that was covered with groves of spices, olives, and\r\norange-trees; and in a word, with the products of every foreign clime.\r\nThe name of the first was Plenty, of the second, Commerce. The first\r\nleaned her right arm upon a plough, and under her left held a huge horn,\r\nout of which she poured a whole autumn of fruits. The other wore a\r\nrostral crown upon her head, and kept her eyes fixed upon a compass.\r\n\r\nI was wonderfully pleased in ranging through this delightful place, and\r\nthe more so, because it was not encumbered with fences and enclosures;\r\ntill at length, methought, I sprung from the ground, and pitched upon\r\nthe top of a hill, that presented several objects to my sight which I\r\nhad not before taken notice of. The winds that passed over this flowery\r\nplain, and through the tops of the trees which were full of blossoms,\r\nblew upon me in such a continued breeze of sweets, that I was\r\nwonderfully charmed with my situation. I here saw all the inner\r\ndeclivities of that great circuit of mountains, whose outside was\r\ncovered with snow, overgrown with huge forests of fir-trees, which\r\nindeed are very frequently found in other parts of the Alps. These trees\r\nwere inhabited by storks, that came thither in great flights from very\r\ndistant quarters of the world. Methought, I was pleased in my dream to\r\nsee what became of these birds, when, upon leaving the places to which\r\nthey make an annual visit, they rise in great flocks so high till they\r\nare out of sight; and for that reason have been thought by some modern\r\nphilosophers to take a flight to the moon. But my eyes were soon\r\ndiverted from this prospect, when I observed two great gaps that led\r\nthrough this circuit of mountains, where guards and watches were posted\r\nday and night. Upon examination I found, that there were two formidable\r\nenemies encamped before each of these avenues, who kept the place in a\r\nperpetual alarm, and watched all opportunities of invading it.\r\n\r\nTyranny was at the head of one of these armies, dressed in an Eastern\r\nhabit, and grasping in her hand an iron sceptre. Behind her was\r\nBarbarity, with the garb and complexion of an Ethiopian; Ignorance with\r\na turban upon her head; and Persecution holding up a bloody flag,\r\nembroidered with fleurs-de-luce. These were followed by Oppression,\r\nPoverty, Famine, Torture, and a dreadful train of appearances, that made\r\nme tremble to behold them. Among the baggage of this army, I could\r\ndiscover racks, wheels, chains, and gibbets, with all the instruments\r\nart could invent to make human nature miserable.\r\n\r\nBefore the other avenue I saw Licentiousness, dressed in a garment not\r\nunlike the Polish cassock, and leading up a whole army of monsters, such\r\nas Clamour, with a hoarse voice and a hundred tongues; Confusion, with a\r\nmisshapen body and a thousand heads; Impudence, with a forehead of\r\nbrass; and Rapine, with hands of iron. The tumult, noise, and uproar in\r\nthis quarter were so very great, that they disturbed my imagination\r\nmore than is consistent with sleep, and by that means awaked me.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 210: Cebes, of Thebes, was a disciple of Philolaus and\r\nSocrates.

[ADDISON.\r\n\r\nFrom _Thursday, April 20_, to _Saturday, April 22, 1710_.\r\n\r\n    Tertius e coelo cecidit Cato.--JUV., Sat. ii. 40.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, April 21._\r\n\r\nIn my younger years I used many endeavours to get a place at Court, and\r\nindeed continued my pursuits till I arrived at my grand climacteric: but\r\nat length altogether despairing of success, whether it were for want of\r\ncapacity, friends, or due application, I at last resolved to erect a new\r\noffice, and for my encouragement, to place myself in it. For this\r\nreason, I took upon me the title and dignity of Censor of Great Britain,\r\nreserving to myself all such perquisites, profits, and emoluments as\r\nshould arise out of the discharge of the said office. These in truth\r\nhave not been inconsiderable; for, besides those weekly contributions\r\nwhich I receive from John Morphew, and those annual subscriptions which\r\nI propose to myself from the most elegant part of this great island, I\r\ndaily live in a very comfortable affluence of wine, stale beer, Hungary\r\nwater, beef, books, and marrow-bones, which I receive from many\r\nwell-disposed citizens; not to mention the forfeitures which accrue to\r\nme from the several offenders that appear before me on court-days.\r\n\r\nHaving now enjoyed this office for the space of a twelve-month, I shall\r\ndo what all good officers ought to do, take a survey of my behaviour,\r\nand consider carefully whether I have discharged my duty, and acted up\r\nto the character with which I am invested. For my direction in this\r\nparticular, I have made a narrow search into the nature of the old\r\nRoman censors, whom I must always regard, not only as my predecessors,\r\nbut as my patterns in this great employment; and have several times\r\nasked my own heart with great impartiality, whether Cato will not bear a\r\nmore venerable figure among posterity than Bickerstaff.\r\n\r\nI find the duty of the Roman censor was twofold. The first part of it\r\nconsisted in making frequent reviews of the people, in casting up their\r\nnumbers, ranging them under their several tribes, disposing them into\r\nproper classes, and subdividing them into their respective centuries.\r\n\r\nIn compliance with this part of the office, I have taken many curious\r\nsurveys of this great city. I have collected into particular bodies the\r\nDappers[212] and the Smarts,[213] the Natural and Affected Rakes,[214]\r\nthe Pretty Fellows and the Very Pretty Fellows.[215] I have likewise\r\ndrawn out in several distinct parties your Pedants[216] and Men of\r\nFire,[217] your Gamesters[218] and Politicians.[219] I have separated\r\nCits from Citizens,[220] Freethinkers from Philosophers,[221] Wits from\r\nSnuff-takers,[222] and Duellists from Men of Honour.[223] I have\r\nlikewise made a calculation of Esquires,[224] not only considering the\r\nseveral distinct swarms of them that are settled in the different parts\r\nof this town, but also that more rugged species that inhabit the fields\r\nand woods, and are often found in pothouses, and upon haycocks.\r\n\r\nI shall pass the soft sex over in silence, having not yet reduced them\r\ninto any tolerable order; as likewise the softer tribe of lovers, which\r\nwill cost me a great deal of time, before I shall be able to cast them\r\ninto their several centuries and subdivisions.\r\n\r\nThe second part of the Roman censor's office was to look into the\r\nmanners of the people, and to check any growing luxury, whether in diet,\r\ndress, or building. This duty likewise I have endeavoured to discharge,\r\nby those wholesome precepts which I have given my countrymen in regard\r\nto beef and mutton, and the severe censures which I have passed upon\r\nragouts and fricassees.[225] There is not, as I am informed, a pair of\r\nred heels[226] to be seen within ten miles of London, which I may\r\nlikewise ascribe, without vanity, to the becoming zeal which I expressed\r\nin that particular. I must own, my success with the petticoat[227] is\r\nnot so great: but as I have not yet done with it, I hope I shall in a\r\nlittle time put an effectual stop to that growing evil. As for the\r\narticle of building, I intend hereafter to enlarge upon it, having\r\nlately observed several warehouses, nay private shops, that stand upon\r\nCorinthian pillars, and whole rows of tin pots showing themselves, in\r\norder to their sale, through a sash-window.\r\n\r\nI have likewise followed the example of the Roman censors, in punishing\r\noffences according to the quality of the offender. It was usual for them\r\nto expel a senator who had been guilty of great immoralities out of the\r\nsenate-house, by omitting his name when they called over the list of his\r\nbrethren. In the same manner, to remove effectually several worthless\r\nmen who stand possessed of great honours, I have made frequent draughts\r\nof dead men[228] out of the vicious part of the nobility, and given them\r\nup to the new society of upholders, with the necessary orders for their\r\ninterment. As the Roman censors used to punish the knights or gentlemen\r\nof Rome, by taking away their horses from them, I have seized the\r\ncanes[229] of many criminals of figure, whom I had just reason to\r\nanimadvert upon. As for the offenders among the common people of Rome,\r\nthey were generally chastised, by being thrown out of a higher tribe,\r\nand placed in one which was not so honourable. My reader cannot but\r\nthink I have had an eye to this punishment, when I have degraded one\r\nspecies of men into bombs, squibs, and crackers,[230] and another into\r\ndrums, bass-viols, and bagpipes;[231] not to mention whole packs of\r\ndelinquents whom I have shut up in kennels, and the new hospital which I\r\nam at present erecting, for the reception of those my countrymen who\r\ngive me but little hopes of their amendment, on the borders of\r\nMoorfields.[232] I shall only observe upon this last particular, that\r\nsince some late surveys I have taken of this island, I shall think it\r\nnecessary to enlarge the plan of the buildings which I design in this\r\nquarter.\r\n\r\nWhen my great predecessor Cato the elder stood for the Censorship of\r\nRome, there were several other competitors who offered themselves; and\r\nto get an interest among the people, gave them great promises of the\r\nmild and gentle treatment which they would use towards them in that\r\noffice. Cato on the contrary told them, he presented himself as a\r\ncandidate, because he knew the age was sunk in immorality and\r\ncorruption; and that if they would give him their votes, he would\r\npromise them to make use of such a strictness and severity of discipline\r\nas should recover them out of it. The Roman historians, upon this\r\noccasion, very much celebrate the public-spiritedness of that people,\r\nwho chose Cato for their censor, notwithstanding his method of\r\nrecommending himself. I may in some measure extol my own countrymen\r\nupon the same account, who, without any respect to party, or any\r\napplication from myself, have made such generous subscriptions for the\r\nCensor of Great Britain, as will give a magnificence to my old age, and\r\nwhich I esteem more than I would any post in Europe of a hundred times\r\nthe value. I shall only add, that upon looking into my catalogue of\r\nsubscribers, which I intend to print alphabetically in the front of my\r\nLucubrations, I find the names of the greatest beauties and wits in the\r\nwhole island of Great Britain, which I only mention for the benefit of\r\nany of them who have not subscribed, it being my design to close the\r\nsubscription in a very short time.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 212: See No. 85.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 213: See Nos. 26, 28.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 214: See Nos. 27, 143.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 215: See Nos. 21, 22, 24.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 216: See No. 158.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 217: See No. 61.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 218: See Nos. 13, 14, 15, 56, &c.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 219: See Nos. 40, 155.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 220: See No. 25.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 221: See Nos. 108, 111, 135.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 222: See Nos. 35, 141.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 223: See Nos. 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 39.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 224: See Nos. 19, 115.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 225: See No. 148.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 226: See No. 26.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 227: See No. 116.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 228: See Nos. 96, 110.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 229: See No. 26.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 230: See No. 88.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 231: See No. 153.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 232: See Nos. 62, 127.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 163.

I never\r\nread a Gazette in my life; and never trouble my head about our armies,\r\nwhether they win or lose, or in what part of the world they lie\r\nencamped.\" Without giving me time to reply, he drew a paper of verses\r\nout of his pocket, telling me, that he had something which would\r\nentertain me more agreeably, and that he would desire my judgment upon\r\nevery line, for that we had time enough before us till the company came\r\nin.\r\n\r\nNed Softly is a very pretty poet, and a great admirer of easy lines.\r\nWaller is his favourite: and as that admirable writer has the best and\r\nworst verses of any among our great English poets, Ned Softly has got\r\nall the bad ones without book, which he repeats upon occasion, to show\r\nhis reading, and garnish his conversation. Ned is indeed a true English\r\nreader, incapable of relishing the great and masterly strokes of this\r\nart; but wonderfully pleased with the little Gothic ornaments of\r\nepigrammatical conceits, turns, points, and quibbles, which are so\r\nfrequent in the most admired of our English poets, and practised by\r\nthose who want genius and strength to represent, after the manner of the\r\nancients, simplicity in its natural beauty and perfection.\r\n\r\nFinding myself unavoidably engaged in such a conversation, I was\r\nresolved to turn my pain into a pleasure, and to divert myself as well\r\nas I could with so very odd a fellow. \"You must understand,\" says Ned,\r\n\"that the sonnet I am going to read to you was written upon a lady, who\r\nshowed me some verses of her own making, and is perhaps the best poet of\r\nour age. But you shall hear it.\" Upon which he began to read as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    \"_To Mira on her Incomparable Poems._\r\n\r\n    I.\r\n\r\n    \"_When dressed in laurel wreaths you shine,\r\n      And tune your soft melodious notes,\r\n    You seem a sister of the Nine,\r\n      Or Phoebus' self in petticoats._\r\n\r\n    II.\r\n\r\n    \"_I fancy, when your song you sing\r\n      (Your song you sing with so much art),\r\n    Your pen was plucked from Cupid's wing;\r\n      For ah! it wounds me like his dart._\"\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" says I, \"this is a little nosegay of conceits, a very lump of\r\nsalt: every verse has something in it that piques; and then the dart in\r\nthe last line is certainly as pretty a sting in the tail of an epigram\r\n(for so I think your critics call it) as ever entered into the thought\r\nof a poet.\" \"Dear Mr. Bickerstaff,\" says he, shaking me by the hand,\r\n\"everybody knows you to be a judge of these things; and to tell you\r\ntruly, I read over Roscommon's translation of Horace's 'Art of Poetry'\r\nthree several times, before I sat down to write the sonnet which I have\r\nshown you. But you shall hear it again, and pray observe every line of\r\nit, for not one of them shall pass without your approbation.\r\n\r\n    \"_When dressed in laurel wreaths you shine._\r\n\r\n\"That is,\" says he, \"when you have your garland on; when you are writing\r\nverses.\" To which I replied, \"I know your meaning: a metaphor!\" \"The\r\nsame,\" said he, and went on:\r\n\r\n    \"_And tune your soft melodious notes._\r\n\r\n\"Pray observe the gliding of that verse; there is scarce a consonant in\r\nit: I took care to make it run upon liquids. Give me your opinion of\r\nit.\" \"Truly,\" said I, \"I think it as good as the former.\" \"I am very\r\nglad to hear you say so,\" says he; \"but mind the next:\r\n\r\n    \"_You seem a sister of the Nine._\r\n\r\n\"That is,\" says he, \"you seem a sister of the Muses; for if you look\r\ninto ancient authors, you will find it was their opinion, that there\r\nwere nine of them.\" \"I remember it very well,\" said I; \"but pray\r\nproceed.\"\r\n\r\n    \"_Or Phoebus' self in petticoats._\r\n\r\n\"Phoebus,\" says he, \"was the God of Poetry. These little instances,\r\nMr. Bickerstaff, show a gentleman's reading. Then to take off from the\r\nair of learning, which Phoebus and the Muses have given to this first\r\nstanza, you may observe how it falls all of a sudden into the familiar;\r\n'in petticoats!'\r\n\r\n    \"_Or Phoebus' self in petticoats._\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us now,\" says I, \"enter upon the second stanza. I find the first\r\nline is still a continuation of the metaphor:\r\n\r\n    \"_I fancy, when your song you sing._\"\r\n\r\n\"It is very right,\" says he; \"but pray observe the turn of words in\r\nthose two lines. I was a whole hour in adjusting of them, and have still\r\na doubt upon me, whether in the second line it should be, 'Your song you\r\nsing'; or, 'You sing your song'? You shall hear them both:\r\n\r\n    \"_I fancy, when your song you sing\r\n      (Your song you sing with so much art)._\"\r\n\r\nOr,\r\n\r\n    \"_I fancy, when your song you sing\r\n      (You sing your song with so much art)._\"\r\n\r\n\"Truly,\" said I, \"the turn is so natural either way, that you have made\r\nme almost giddy with it.\" \"Dear sir,\" said he, grasping me by the hand,\r\n\"you have a great deal of patience; but pray what do you think of the\r\nnext verse:\r\n\r\n    \"_Your pen was plucked from Cupid's wing?_\"\r\n\r\n\"Think!\" says I; \"I think you have made Cupid look like a little goose.\"\r\n\"That was my meaning,\" says he; \"I think the ridicule is well enough hit\r\noff. But we now come to the last, which sums up the whole matter:\r\n\r\n    \"_For ah! it wounds me like his dart._\r\n\r\n\"Pray, how do you like that 'Ah!' Does it not make a pretty figure in\r\nthat place? 'Ah!' It looks as if I felt the dart, and cried out at being\r\npricked with it:\r\n\r\n    \"_For ah! it wounds me like his dart._\r\n\r\n\"My friend Dick Easy,\"[233] continued he, \"assured me he would rather\r\nhave written that 'Ah!' than to have been the author of the 'Æneid.' He\r\nindeed objected that I made Mira's pen like a quill in one of the lines,\r\nand like a dart in the other. But as to that--\" \"Oh! as to that,\" says\r\nI, \"it is but supposing Cupid to be like a porcupine, and his quills and\r\ndarts will be the same thing.\" He was going to embrace me for the hint;\r\nbut half a dozen critics coming into the room, whose faces he did not\r\nlike, he conveyed the sonnet into his pocket, and whispered me in the\r\near, he would show it me again as soon as his man had written it over\r\nfair.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 233: Perhaps Henry Cromwell.

As\r\nthis collection will grow daily, I have digested it into several\r\nbundles, and made proper endorsements on each particular letter, it\r\nbeing my design, when I lay down the work that I am now engaged in, to\r\nerect a Paper Office, and give it to the public.[234]\r\n\r\nI could not but make several observations upon reading over the letters\r\nof my correspondents: as first of all, on the different tastes that\r\nreign in the different parts of this city. I find, by the approbations\r\nwhich are given me, that I am seldom famous on the same days on both\r\nsides of Temple Bar; and that when I am in the greatest repute within\r\nthe Liberties, I dwindle at the court end of the town. Sometimes I sink\r\nin both these places at the same time; but for my comfort, my name has\r\nthen been up in the districts of Wapping and Rotherhithe. Some of my\r\ncorrespondents desire me to be always serious, and others to be always\r\nmerry. Some of them entreat me to go to bed and fall into a dream, and\r\nlike me better when I am asleep than when I am awake: others advise me\r\nto sit all night upon the stars, and be more frequent in my astrological\r\nobservations; for that a vision is not properly a lucubration. Some of\r\nmy readers thank me for filling my paper with the flowers of antiquity,\r\nothers desire news from Flanders. Some approve my criticisms on the\r\ndead, and others my censures on the living. For this reason, I once\r\nresolved in the new edition of my works, to range my several papers\r\nunder distinct heads, according as their principal design was to benefit\r\nand instruct the different capacities of my readers, and to follow the\r\nexample of some very great authors, by writing at the head of each\r\ndiscourse, \"Ad Aulam,\" \"Ad Academiam,\" \"Ad Populum,\" \"Ad Clerum.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no particular in which my correspondents of all ages,\r\nconditions, sexes, and complexions, universally agree, except only in\r\ntheir thirst after scandal. It is impossible to conceive how many have\r\nrecommended their neighbours to me upon this account, or how\r\nunmercifully I have been abused by several unknown hands, for not\r\npublishing the secret histories of cuckoldom that I have received from\r\nalmost every street in town.\r\n\r\nIt would indeed be very dangerous for me to read over the many praises\r\nand eulogiums which come post to me from all the corners of the nation,\r\nwere they not mixed with many checks, reprimands, scurrilities, and\r\nreproaches, which several of my good-natured countrymen cannot forbear\r\nsending me, though it often costs them twopence or a groat before they\r\ncan convey them to my hands:[235] so that sometimes when I am put into\r\nthe best humour in the world, after having read a panegyric upon my\r\nperformance, and looked upon myself as a benefactor to the British\r\nnation, the next letter perhaps I open, begins with, \"You old doting\r\nscoundrel;\" \"Are not you a sad dog?\" \"Sirrah, you deserve to have your\r\nnose slit;\" and the like ingenious conceits. These little mortifications\r\nare necessary to surpass that pride and vanity which naturally arise in\r\nthe mind of a received author, and enable me to bear the reputation\r\nwhich my courteous readers bestow upon me, without becoming a coxcomb by\r\nit. It was for the same reason, that when a Roman general entered the\r\ncity in the pomp of a triumph, the commonwealth allowed of several\r\nlittle drawbacks to his reputation, by conniving at such of the rabble\r\nas repeated libels and lampoons upon him within his hearing, and by that\r\nmeans engaged his thoughts upon his weakness and imperfections, as well\r\nas on the merits that advanced him to so great honours. The conqueror\r\nhowever was not the less esteemed for being a man in some particulars,\r\nbecause he appeared as a god in others.\r\n\r\nThere is another circumstance in which my countrymen have dealt very\r\nperversely with me; and that is, in searching not only into my own life,\r\nbut also into the lives of my ancestors. If there has been a blot in my\r\nfamily for these ten generations, it has been discovered by some or\r\nother of my correspondents. In short, I find the ancient family of the\r\nBickerstaffs has suffered very much through the malice and prejudice of\r\nmy enemies. Some of them twit me in the teeth with the conduct of my\r\nAunt Margery:[236] nay, there are some who have been so disingenuous, as\r\nto throw Maud the Milkmaid[237] into my dish, notwithstanding I myself\r\nwas the first who discovered that alliance. I reap however many\r\nbenefits from the malice of these my enemies, as they let me see my own\r\nfaults, and give me a view of myself in the worst light; as they hinder\r\nme from being blown up by flattery and self-conceit; as they make me\r\nkeep a watchful eye over my own actions, and at the same time make me\r\ncautious how I talk of others, and particularly of my friends and\r\nrelations, or value myself upon the antiquity of my family.\r\n\r\nBut the most formidable part of my correspondents are those whose\r\nletters are filled with threats and menaces. I have been treated so\r\noften after this manner, that not thinking it sufficient to fence well,\r\nin which I am now arrived at the utmost perfection,[238] and carry\r\npistols about me, which I have always tucked within my girdle; I several\r\nmonths since made my will, settled my estate, and took leave of my\r\nfriends, looking upon myself as no better than a dead man. Nay, I went\r\nso far as to write a long letter to the most intimate acquaintance I\r\nhave in the world, under the character of a departed person, giving him\r\nan account of what brought me to that untimely end, and of the fortitude\r\nwith which I met it. This letter being too long for the present paper, I\r\nintend to print it by itself very suddenly; and at the same time I must\r\nconfess, I took my hint of it from the behaviour of an old soldier in\r\nthe Civil Wars, who was corporal of a company in a regiment of foot,\r\nabout the same time that I myself was a cadet in the King's army.\r\n\r\nThis gentleman was taken by the enemy; and the two parties were upon\r\nsuch terms at that time, that we did not treat each other as prisoners\r\nof war, but as traitors and rebels. The poor corporal being condemned to\r\ndie, wrote a letter to his wife when under sentence of execution. He\r\nwrit on the Thursday, and was to be executed on the Friday: but\r\nconsidering that the letter would not come to his wife's hands till\r\nSaturday, the day after execution, and being at that time more\r\nscrupulous than ordinary in speaking exact truth, he formed his letter\r\nrather according to the posture of his affairs when she should read it,\r\nthan as they stood when he sent it; though it must be confessed, there\r\nis a certain perplexity in the style of it, which the reader will easily\r\npardon, considering his circumstances:\r\n\r\n     \"DEAR WIFE,\r\n\r\n     \"Hoping you are in good health, as I am at this present writing,\r\n     this is to let you know, that yesterday, between the hours of\r\n     eleven and twelve, I was hanged, drawn and quartered. I died very\r\n     penitently, and everybody thought my case very hard. Remember me\r\n     kindly to my poor fatherless children.\r\n\r\n                                              \"Yours till death,\r\n                                                              \"W. B.\"\r\n\r\nIt so happened, that this honest fellow was relieved by a party of his\r\nfriends, and had the satisfaction to see all the rebels hanged who had\r\nbeen his enemies. I must not omit a circumstance which exposed him to\r\nraillery his whole life after. Before the arrival of the next post, that\r\nwould have set all things clear, his wife was married to a second\r\nhusband, who lived in the peaceful possession of her; and the corporal,\r\nwho was a man of plain understanding, did not care to stir in the\r\nmatter, as knowing that she had the news of his death under his own\r\nhand, which she might have produced upon occasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 234: This idea was carried out in 1725, when Charles Lillie\r\npublished, by Steele's permission, two volumes of \"Original and genuine\r\nLetters sent to the _Tatler_ and _Spectator_, during the time those\r\nworks were publishing.

As it\r\nshall ever be my study to make discoveries of this nature in human life,\r\nand to settle the proper distinctions between the virtues and\r\nperfections of mankind, and those false colours and resemblances of them\r\nthat shine alike in the eyes of the vulgar; so I shall be more\r\nparticularly careful to search into the various merits and pretences of\r\nthe learned world. This is the more necessary, because there seems to be\r\na general combination among the pedants to extol one another's labours,\r\nand cry up one another's parts; while men of sense, either through that\r\nmodesty which is natural to them, or the scorn they have for such\r\ntrifling commendations, enjoy their stock of knowledge like a hidden\r\ntreasure, with satisfaction and silence. Pedantry indeed in learning is\r\nlike hypocrisy in religion, a form of knowledge without the power of it,\r\nthat attracts the eyes of the common people, breaks out in noise and\r\nshow, and finds its reward not from any inward pleasure that attends it,\r\nbut from the praises and approbations which it receives from men.\r\n\r\nOf this shallow species there is not a more importunate, empty, and\r\nconceited animal, than that which is generally known by the name of a\r\ncritic. This, in the common acceptation of the word, is one that,\r\nwithout entering into the sense and soul of an author, has a few general\r\nrules, which, like mechanical instruments, he applies to the works of\r\nevery writer, and as they quadrate with them, pronounces the author\r\nperfect or defective. He is master of a certain set of words, as \"unity,\r\nstyle, fire, phlegm, easy, natural, turn, sentiment,\" and the like;\r\nwhich he varies, compounds, divides, and throws together, in every part\r\nof his discourse, without any thought or meaning. The marks you may know\r\nhim by are, an elevated eye, and dogmatical brow, a positive voice, and\r\na contempt for everything that comes out, whether he has read it or not.\r\nHe dwells altogether in generals. He praises or dispraises in the lump.\r\nHe shakes his head very frequently at the pedantry of Universities, and\r\nbursts into laughter when you mention an author that is not known at\r\nWill's. He has formed his judgment upon Homer, Horace, and Virgil, not\r\nfrom their own works, but from those of Rapin and Bossu. He knows his\r\nown strength so well, that he never dares praise anything in which he\r\nhas not a French author for his voucher.\r\n\r\nWith these extraordinary talents and accomplishments, Sir Timothy\r\nTittle[239] puts men in vogue, or condemns them to obscurity, and sits\r\nas judge of life and death upon every author that appears in public. It\r\nis impossible to represent the pangs, agonies, and convulsions which Sir\r\nTimothy expresses in every feature of his face, and muscle of his body,\r\nupon the reading of a bad poet.\r\n\r\nAbout a week ago I was engaged at a friend's of mine in an agreeable\r\nconversation with his wife and daughters, when in the height of our\r\nmirth, Sir Timothy, who makes love to my friend's eldest daughter, came\r\nin amongst us puffing and blowing as if he had been very much out of\r\nbreath. He immediately called for a chair, and desired leave to sit\r\ndown, without any further ceremony. I asked him where he had been?\r\nwhether he was out of order? He only replied, that he was quite spent,\r\nand fell a-cursing in soliloquy. I could hear him cry, \"A wicked rogue;\"\r\n\"An execrable wretch;\" \"Was there ever such a monster?\" The young ladies\r\nupon this began to be affrighted, and asked whether any one had hurt\r\nhim? He answered nothing, but still talked to himself. \"To lay the first\r\nscene,\" says he, \"in St. James's Park, and the last in Northamptonshire.\"\r\n\"Is that all?\" says I. \"Then I suppose you have been at the rehearsal of\r\na play this morning?\" \"Been!\" says he; \"I have been at Northampton, in\r\nthe Park, in a lady's bed-chamber, in a dining-room, everywhere; the\r\nrogue has led me such a dance.\" Though I could scarce forbear laughing\r\nat his discourse, I told him I was glad it was no worse, and that he was\r\nonly metaphorically weary. \"In short, sir,\" says he, \"the author has not\r\nobserved a single unity in his whole play; the scene shifts in every\r\ndialogue; the villain has hurried me up and down at such a rate, that I\r\nam tired off my legs.\" I could not but observe with some pleasure, that\r\nthe young lady whom he made love to conceived a very just aversion to\r\nhim, upon seeing him so very passionate in trifles. And as she had that\r\nnatural sense which makes her a better judge than a thousand critics,\r\nshe began to rally him upon this foolish humour. \"For my part,\" says\r\nshe, \"I never knew a play take that was written up to your rules, as you\r\ncall them.\" \"How, madam!\" says he; \"is that your opinion? I am sure you\r\nhave a better taste.\" \"It is a pretty kind of magic,\" says she, \"the\r\npoets have, to transport an audience from place to place without the\r\nhelp of a coach and horses. I could travel round the world at such a\r\nrate. 'Tis such an entertainment as an enchantress finds when she\r\nfancies herself in a wood, or upon a mountain, at a feast, or a\r\nsolemnity; though at the same time she has never stirred out of her\r\ncottage.\" \"Your simile, madam,\" says Sir Timothy, \"is by no means\r\njust.\" \"Pray,\" says she, \"let my similes pass without a criticism. I\r\nmust confess,\" continued she (for I found she was resolved to exasperate\r\nhim), \"I laughed very heartily at the last new comedy which you found so\r\nmuch fault with.\" \"But, madam,\" says he, \"you ought not to have laughed;\r\nand I defy any one to show me a single rule that you could laugh by.\"\r\n\"Ought not to laugh!\" says she: \"pray, who should hinder me?\" \"Madam,\"\r\nsays he, \"there are such people in the world as Rapin, Dacier, and\r\nseveral others, that ought to have spoiled your mirth.\" \"I have heard,\"\r\nsays the young lady, \"that your great critics are always very bad poets:\r\nI fancy there is as much difference between the works of one and the\r\nother, as there is between the carriage of a dancing-master and a\r\ngentleman. I must confess,\" continued she, \"I would not be troubled with\r\nso fine a judgment as yours is; for I find you feel more vexation in a\r\nbad comedy than I do in a deep tragedy.\" \"Madam,\" says Sir Timothy,\r\n\"that is not my fault; they should learn the art of writing.\" \"For my\r\npart,\" says the young lady, \"I should think the greatest art in your\r\nwriters of comedies is to please.\" \"To please!\" says Sir Timothy; and\r\nimmediately fell a-laughing. \"Truly,\" says she, \"that is my opinion.\"\r\nUpon this, he composed his countenance, looked upon his watch, and took\r\nhis leave.\r\n\r\nI hear that Sir Timothy has not been at my friend's house since this\r\nnotable conference, to the great satisfaction of the young lady, who by\r\nthis means has got rid of a very impertinent fop.\r\n\r\nI must confess, I could not but observe, with a great deal of surprise,\r\nhow this gentleman, by his ill-nature, folly, and affectation, has made\r\nhimself capable of suffering so many imaginary pains, and looking with\r\nsuch a senseless severity upon the common diversions of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 239: Perhaps Henry Cromwell; see Nos. 47, 49, 163.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 166.

This afternoon, as I was\r\ntalking with fine Mrs. Sprightly's porter, and desiring admittance upon\r\nan extraordinary occasion, it was my fate to be spied by Tom Modely\r\nriding by in his chariot. He did me the honour to stop, and asked what I\r\ndid there of a Monday? I answered that I had business of importance,\r\nwhich I wanted to communicate to the lady of the house. Tom is one of\r\nthose fools who look upon knowledge of the fashion to be the only\r\nliberal science; and was so rough as to tell me, that a well-bred man\r\nwould as soon call upon a lady (who keeps a day) at midnight, as on any\r\nday but that on which she professes being at home. There are rules and\r\ndecorums which are never to be transgressed by those who understand the\r\nworld; and he who offends in this kind, ought not to take it ill if he\r\nis turned away, even when he sees the person look out at her window whom\r\nhe inquires for. \"Nay,\" said he, \"my Lady Dimple is so positive in this\r\nrule, that she takes it for a piece of good breeding and distinction to\r\ndeny herself with her own mouth. Mrs. Comma,[240] the great scholar,\r\ninsists upon it; and I myself have heard her assert, that a lord's\r\nporter, or a lady's woman, cannot be said to lie in that case, because\r\nthey act by instruction; and their words are no more their own, than\r\nthose of a puppet.\"\r\n\r\nHe was going on with this ribaldry, when on a sudden he looked on his\r\nwatch, and said, he had twenty visits to make, and drove away without\r\nfurther ceremony. I was then at leisure to reflect upon the tasteless\r\nmanner of life, which a set of idle fellows lead in this town, and spend\r\nyouth itself with less spirit, than other men do their old age. These\r\nexpletives in human society, though they are in themselves wholly\r\ninsignificant, become of some consideration when they are mixed with\r\nothers. I am very much at a loss how to define, or under what character,\r\ndistinction, or denomination, to place them, except you give me leave to\r\ncall them the Order of the Insipids. This order is in its extent like\r\nthat of the Jesuits, and you see of them in every way of life, and in\r\nevery profession. Tom Modely has long appeared to me at the head of this\r\nspecies. By being habitually in the best company, he knows perfectly\r\nwell when a coat is well cut, or a periwig well mounted.[241] As soon as\r\nyou enter the place where he is, he tells the next man to him who is\r\nyour tailor, and judges of you more from the choice of your\r\nperiwig-maker than of your friend. His business in this world is to be\r\nwell dressed; and the greatest circumstance that is to be recorded in\r\nhis annals is, that he wears twenty shirts a week. Thus, without ever\r\nspeaking reason among the men, or passion among the women, he is\r\neverywhere well received; and without any one man's esteem, he has every\r\nman's indulgence.\r\n\r\nThis order has produced great numbers of tolerable copiers in painting,\r\ngood rhymers in poetry, and harmless projectors in politics. You may see\r\nthem at first sight grow acquainted by sympathy, insomuch that one who\r\nhad not studied nature, and did not know the true cause of their sudden\r\nfamiliarities, would think that they had some secret intimation of each\r\nother, like the freemasons. The other day at Will's I heard Modely, and\r\na critic of the same order, show their equal talents with great delight.\r\nThe learned insipid was commending Racine's turns; the genteel insipid,\r\nDevillier's curls.[242]\r\n\r\nThese creatures, when they are not forced into any particular\r\nemployment, for want of ideas in their own imaginations, are the\r\nconstant plague of all they meet with by inquiries for news and scandal,\r\nwhich makes them the heroes of visiting-days, where they help the design\r\nof the meeting, which is to pass away that odious thing called Time, in\r\ndiscourses too trivial to raise any reflections which may put well-bred\r\npersons to the trouble of thinking.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, May 1._\r\n\r\nI was looking out of my parlour window this morning,[243] and receiving\r\nthe honours which Margery, the milkmaid to our lane, was doing me, by\r\ndancing before my door with the plate of half her customers on her\r\nhead, when Mr. Clayton,[244] the author of \"Arsinoe,\" made me a visit,\r\nand desired me to insert the following advertisement in my ensuing\r\npaper:\r\n\r\n     The Pastoral Masque composed by Mr. Clayton, author of \"Arsinoe,\"\r\n     will be performed on Wednesday the 3rd instant, in the great room\r\n     at York Buildings.[245] Tickets are to be had at White's\r\n     Chocolate-house, St. James's Coffee-house in St. James's Street,\r\n     and Young Man's Coffee-house.[246]\r\n\r\n     Note. The tickets delivered out for the 27th of April will be\r\n     taken then.\r\n\r\nWhen I granted his request, I made one to him, which was, that the\r\nperformers should put their instruments in tune before the audience came\r\nin; for that I thought the resentment of the Eastern Prince, who,\r\naccording to the old story, took \"tuning\" for \"playing,\" to be very just\r\nand natural. He was so civil, as not only to promise that favour, but\r\nalso to assure me, that he would order the heels of the performers to be\r\nmuffled in cotton, that the artists in so polite an age as ours, may not\r\nintermix with their harmony a custom which so nearly resembles the\r\nstamping dances of the West Indians or Hottentots.\r\n\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENTS.\r\n\r\nA Bass-viol of Mr. Bickerstaff's acquaintance, whose mind and fortune do\r\nnot very exactly agree, proposes to set himself to sale by way of\r\nlottery.[247] Ten thousand pounds is the sum to be raised, at threepence\r\na ticket, in consideration that there are more women who are willing to\r\nbe married than that can spare a greater sum. He has already made over\r\nhis person to trustees for the said money to be forthcoming, and ready\r\nto take to wife the fortunate woman that wins him.\r\n\r\nN.B.

As the rude and untaught multitude\r\nare no way wrought upon more effectually than by seeing public\r\npunishments and executions, so men of letters and education feel their\r\nhumanity most forcibly exercised, when they attend the obsequies of men\r\nwho had arrived at any perfection in liberal accomplishments. Theatrical\r\naction is to be esteemed as such, except it be objected, that we cannot\r\ncall that an art which cannot be attained by art. Voice, stature,\r\nmotion, and other gifts, must be very bountifully bestowed by Nature, or\r\nlabour and industry will but push the unhappy endeavourer, in that way,\r\nthe further off his wishes.\r\n\r\nSuch an actor as Mr. Betterton ought to be recorded with the same\r\nrespect as Roscius among the Romans. The greatest orator[251] has\r\nthought fit to quote his judgment, and celebrate his life. Roscius was\r\nthe example to all that would form themselves into proper and winning\r\nbehaviour. His action was so well adapted to the sentiments he\r\nexpressed, that the youth of Rome thought they wanted only to be\r\nvirtuous to be as graceful in their appearance as Roscius. The\r\nimagination took a lively impression of what was great and good; and\r\nthey who never thought of setting up for the arts of imitation, became\r\nthemselves imitable characters.\r\n\r\nThere is no human invention so aptly calculated for the forming a\r\nfree-born people as that of a theatre. Tully reports that the celebrated\r\nplayer of whom I am speaking used frequently to say, \"The perfection of\r\nan actor is only to become what he is doing.\" Young men, who are too\r\nunattentive to receive lectures, are irresistibly taken with\r\nperformances. Hence it is, that I extremely lament the little relish the\r\ngentry of this nation have at present for the just and noble\r\nrepresentations in some of our tragedies. The operas which are of late\r\nintroduced can leave no trace behind them that can be of service beyond\r\nthe present moment. To sing and to dance are accomplishments very few\r\nhave any thoughts of practising; but to speak justly, and move\r\ngracefully, is what every man thinks he does perform, or wishes he did.\r\n\r\nI have hardly a notion, that any performer of antiquity could surpass\r\nthe action of Mr. Betterton in any of the occasions in which he has\r\nappeared on our stage. The wonderful agony which he appeared in, when he\r\nexamined the circumstance of the handkerchief in \"Othello\"; the mixture\r\nof love that intruded upon his mind upon the innocent answers Desdemona\r\nmakes, betrayed in his gesture such a variety and vicissitude of\r\npassions, as would admonish a man to be afraid of his own heart, and\r\nperfectly convince him, that it is to stab it to admit that worst of\r\ndaggers, jealousy. Whoever reads in his closet this admirable scene,\r\nwill find that he cannot, except he has as warm an imagination as\r\nShakespeare himself, find any but dry, incoherent, and broken sentences:\r\nbut a reader that has seen Betterton act it, observes there could not be\r\na word added; that longer speeches had been unnatural, nay impossible,\r\nin Othello's circumstances. The charming passage in the same tragedy,\r\nwhere he tells the manner of winning the affection of his mistress, was\r\nurged with so moving and graceful an energy, that while I walked in the\r\ncloisters, I thought of him with the same concern as if I waited for the\r\nremains of a person who had in real life done all that I had seen him\r\nrepresent. The gloom of the place, and faint lights before the ceremony\r\nappeared, contributed to the melancholy disposition I was in; and I\r\nbegan to be extremely afflicted, that Brutus and Cassius had any\r\ndifference; that Hotspur's gallantry was so unfortunate; and that the\r\nmirth and good humour of Falstaff could not exempt him from the grave.\r\nNay, this occasion in me, who look upon the distinctions amongst men to\r\nbe merely scenical, raised reflections upon the emptiness of all human\r\nperfection and greatness in general; and I could not but regret, that\r\nthe sacred heads which lie buried in the neighbourhood of this little\r\nportion of earth in which my poor old friend is deposited, are returned\r\nto dust as well as he, and that there is no difference in the grave\r\nbetween the imaginary and the real monarch. This made me say of human\r\nlife itself with Macbeth:\r\n\r\n    \"_To-morrow, to-morrow, and to-morrow,\r\n    Creeps in a stealing pace from day to day,\r\n    To the last moment of recorded time!\r\n    And all our yesterdays have lighted fools\r\n    To their eternal night! Out, out short candle!\r\n    Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player\r\n    That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,\r\n    And then is heard no more._\"[252]\r\n\r\nThe mention I have here made of Mr. Betterton, for whom I had, as long\r\nas I have known anything, a very great esteem and gratitude for the\r\npleasure he gave me, can do him no good; but it may possibly be of\r\nservice to the unhappy woman he has left behind him,[253] to have it\r\nknown, that this great tragedian was never in a scene half so moving as\r\nthe circumstances of his affairs created at his departure. His wife,\r\nafter the cohabitation of forty years in the strictest amity, has long\r\npined away with a sense of his decay, as well in his person as his\r\nlittle fortune; and in proportion to that, she has herself decayed both\r\nin her health and her reason. Her husband's death, added to her age and\r\ninfirmities, would certainly have determined her life, but that the\r\ngreatness of her distress has been her relief, by a present deprivation\r\nof her senses. This absence of reason is her best defence against age,\r\nsorrow, poverty, and sickness. I dwell upon this account so distinctly,\r\nin obedience to a certain great spirit[254] who hides her name, and has\r\nby letter applied to me to recommend to her some object of compassion,\r\nfrom whom she may be concealed.\r\n\r\nThis, I think, is a proper occasion for exerting such heroic generosity;\r\nand as there is an ingenuous shame in those who have known better\r\nfortune to be reduced to receive obligations, as well as a becoming pain\r\nin the truly generous to receive thanks in this case, both those\r\ndelicacies are preserved; for the person obliged is as incapable of\r\nknowing her benefactress, as her benefactress is unwilling to be known\r\nby her.\r\n\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT.\r\n\r\nWhereas it has been signified to the Censor, that under the pretence\r\nthat he has encouraged the Moving Picture,[255] and particularly admired\r\nthe Walking Statue, some persons within the Liberties of Westminster\r\nhave vended Walking Pictures, insomuch that the said pictures have\r\nwithin few days after sales by auction returned to the habitation of\r\ntheir first proprietors; that matter has been narrowly looked into, and\r\norders are given to Pacolet to take notice of all who are concerned in\r\nsuch frauds, with directions to draw their pictures, that they may be\r\nhanged in effigy, _in terrorem_ of all auctions for the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 250: See Nos. 1, 71, 157. On the 25th of April 1710, there was\r\ngiven for Betterton's benefit, \"The Maid's Tragedy\" of Beaumont and\r\nFletcher, in which he himself performed his celebrated part of\r\nMelantius. This, however, was the last time he was to appear on the\r\nstage, for, having been suddenly seized with the gout, and being\r\nimpatient at the thought of disappointing his friends, he made use of\r\noutward applications to reduce the swellings of his feet, which enabled\r\nhim to walk on the stage, though obliged to have his foot in a slipper.\r\nBut the fomentations he had used occasioning a revulsion of the gouty\r\nhumour to the nobler parts, threw the distemper up into his head, and\r\nterminated his life on the 28th of April. On the 2nd of May his body was\r\ninterred with much ceremony in the cloister of Westminster.--\"This day\r\nis published, 'The Life of Mr. Thomas Betterton'\" (_Postboy_, Sept. 16\r\nto 19, 1710). This book, attributed to Gildon, is dedicated to Richard\r\nSteele, Esq. \"I have chosen,\" says the author, \"to address this\r\ndiscourse to you, because the Art of which it treats is of your familiar\r\nacquaintance, and the graces of action and utterance come naturally\r\nunder the consideration of a dramatic writer.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 251: Cicero.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 252: \"Macbeth,\" act v. sc. 5, quoted inaccurately by Steele.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 253: Betterton married, in 1662, Maria Saunderson, an actress\r\nwho seems to have been as good as she was clever. She lost her reason\r\nafter the death of her husband, but recovered it before her death at the\r\nend of 1711. By her will she bequeathed to Mrs. Bracegirdle, Mrs. Barry,\r\nMr. Doggett, Mr. Wilks, and Mr. Dent, twenty shillings a piece for\r\nrings; and her husband's picture to Mrs. Anne Stevenson, whom she\r\nappointed her residuary legatee.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 254: Possibly Lady Elizabeth Hastings (see Nos. 42, 49), or\r\nperhaps Queen Anne, though it is not likely that she consulted Steele by\r\nletter on the subject.

[STEELE.\r\n\r\nFrom _Thursday, May 4_, to _Saturday, May 6, 1710_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, May 5._\r\n\r\nNever was man so much teased, or suffered half the uneasiness, as I have\r\ndone this evening, between a couple of fellows with whom I was\r\nunfortunately engaged to sup, where there were also several others in\r\ncompany. One of them is the most invincibly impudent, and the other as\r\nincorrigibly absurd. Upon hearing my name, the man of audacity, as he\r\ncalls himself, began to assume an awkward way of reserve, by way of\r\nridicule upon me as a Censor, and said, he must have a care of his\r\nbehaviour, for there would notes be writ upon all that should pass. The\r\nman of freedom and ease (for such the other thinks himself) asked me,\r\nwhether my sister Jenny was breeding or not? After they had done with\r\nme, they were impertinent to a very smart, but well-bred man, who stood\r\nhis ground very well, and let the company see they ought, but could not\r\nbe out of countenance. I look upon such a defence as a real good action;\r\nfor while he received their fire, there was a modest and worthy young\r\ngentleman sat secure by him, and a lady of the family at the same time,\r\nguarded against the nauseous familiarity of the one, and the more\r\npainful mirth of the other. This conversation, where there were a\r\nthousand things said not worth repeating, made me consider with myself,\r\nhow it is that men of these disagreeable characters often go great\r\nlengths in the world, and seldom fail of outstripping men of merit; nay,\r\nsucceed so well, that with a load of imperfections on their heads, they\r\ngo on in opposition to general disesteem, while they who are every way\r\ntheir superiors, languish away their days, though possessed of the\r\napprobation and goodwill of all who know them.\r\n\r\nIf we would examine into the secret spring of action in the impudent and\r\nthe absurd, we shall find, though they bear a great resemblance in their\r\nbehaviour, that they move upon very different principles. The impudent\r\nare pressing, though they know they are disagreeable; the absurd are\r\nimportunate, because they think they are acceptable. Impudence is a\r\nvice, and absurdity a folly. Sir Francis Bacon talks very agreeably upon\r\nthe subject of impudence.[256] He takes notice, that the orator being\r\nasked, what was the first, second, and third requisite, to make a fine\r\nspeaker, still answered, \"Action.\" This, said he, is the very outward\r\nform of speaking, and yet it is what with the generality has more force\r\nthan the most consummate abilities. Impudence is to the rest of mankind\r\nof the same use which action is to orators.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, the gross of men are governed more by appearances than\r\nrealities, and the impudent man in his air and behaviour undertakes for\r\nhimself that he has ability and merit, while the modest or diffident\r\ngives himself up as one who is possessed of neither. For this reason,\r\nmen of front carry things before them with little opposition, and make\r\nso skilful a use of their talent, that they can grow out of humour like\r\nmen of consequence, and be sour, and make their satisfaction do them the\r\nsame service as desert. This way of thinking has often furnished me with\r\nan apology for great men who confer favours on the impudent. In\r\ncarrying on the government of mankind, they are not to consider what men\r\nthey themselves approve in their closets and private conversations, but\r\nwhat men will extend themselves furthest, and more generally pass upon\r\nthe world for such as their patrons want in such and such stations, and\r\nconsequently take so much work off the hands of those who employ them.\r\n\r\nFar be it that I should attempt to lessen the acceptance which men of\r\nthis character meet with in the world; but I humbly propose only, that\r\nthey who have merit of a different kind, would accomplish themselves in\r\nsome degree with this quality of which I am now treating. Nay, I allow\r\nthese gentlemen to press as forward as they please in the advancement of\r\ntheir interests and fortunes, but not to intrude upon others in\r\nconversation also: let them do what they can with the rich and the\r\ngreat, as far as they are suffered, but let them not interrupt the easy\r\nand agreeable. They may be useful as servants in ambition, but never as\r\nassociates in pleasure. However, as I would still drive at something\r\ninstructive in every Lucubration, I must recommend it to all men who\r\nfeel in themselves an impulse towards attempting laudable actions, to\r\nacquire such a degree of assurance, as never to lose the possession of\r\nthemselves in public or private, so far as to be incapable of acting\r\nwith a due decorum on any occasion they are called to. It is a mean want\r\nof fortitude in a good man, not to be able to do a virtuous action with\r\nas much confidence as an impudent fellow does an ill one. There is no\r\nway of mending such false modesty, but by laying it down for a rule,\r\nthat there is nothing shameful but what is criminal.\r\n\r\nThe Jesuits, an order whose institution is perfectly calculated for\r\nmaking a progress in the world, take care to accomplish their disciples\r\nfor it, by breaking them of all impertinent bashfulness, and accustoming\r\nthen to a ready performance of all indifferent things. I remember in my\r\ntravels, when I was once at a public exercise in one of their schools, a\r\nyoung man made a most admirable speech, with all the beauty of action,\r\ncadence of voice, and force of argument imaginable, in defence of the\r\nlove of glory. We were all enamoured with the grace of the youth, as he\r\ncame down from the desk where he spoke to present a copy of his speech\r\nto the head of the society. The principal received it in a very obliging\r\nmanner, and bid him go to the market-place and fetch a joint of meat,\r\nfor he should dine with him. He bowed, and in a trice the orator\r\nreturned, full of the sense of glory in this obedience, and with the\r\nbest shoulder of mutton in the market.\r\n\r\nThis treatment capacitates them for every scene of life. I therefore\r\nrecommend it to the consideration of all who have the instruction of\r\nyouth, which of the two is the most inexcusable, he who does everything\r\nby the mere force of his impudence, or who performs nothing through the\r\noppression of his modesty? In a word, it is a weakness not to be able to\r\nattempt what a man thinks he ought, and there is no modesty but in\r\nself-denial.\r\n\r\nP.S. Upon my coming home I received the following petition and letter:\r\n\r\n                                \"The humble petition of Sarah Lately:\r\n     \"SHEWETH,\r\n\r\n     \"That your petitioner has been one of those ladies who has had fine\r\n     things constantly spoken to her in general terms, and lived, during\r\n     her most blooming years, in daily expectation of declarations of\r\n     marriage, but never had one made to her.\r\n\r\n     \"That she is now in her grand climacteric; which being above the\r\n     space of four virginities, accounting at 15 years each,\r\n\r\n     \"Your petitioner most humbly prays, that in the lottery for the\r\n     Bass-viol[257] she may have four tickets, in consideration that her\r\n     single life has been occasioned by the inconstancy of her lovers,\r\n     and not through the cruelty or forwardness of your petitioner.\r\n\r\n                                     \"And your Petitioner shall,\" &c.\r\n\r\n     \"MR.

Quando ego te aspiciam? quandoque licebit\r\n    Nunc veterum libris, nunc somno, et inertibus horis,\r\n    Ducere sollicitæ jucunda oblivia vitæ?\r\n                                        HOR., 2 Sat. vi. 60.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, May 8._\r\n\r\nThe summer season now approaching, several of our family have invited me\r\nto pass away a month or two in the country, and indeed nothing could be\r\nmore agreeable to me than such a recess, did I not consider that I am by\r\ntwo quarts a worse companion than when I was last among my relations:\r\nand I am admonished by some of our club, who have lately visited\r\nStaffordshire, that they drink at a greater rate than they did at that\r\ntime. As every soil does not produce every fruit or tree, so every vice\r\nis not the growth of every kind of life; and I have, ever since I could\r\nthink, been astonished that drinking should be the vice of the country.\r\nIf it were possible to add to all our senses, as we do to that of sight,\r\nby perspectives, we should methinks more particularly labour to improve\r\nthem in the midst of the variety of beauteous objects which Nature has\r\nproduced to entertain us in the country; and do we in that place destroy\r\nthe use of what organs we have? As for my part, I cannot but lament the\r\ndestruction that has been made of the wild beasts of the field, when I\r\nsee large tracts of earth possessed by men who take no advantage of\r\ntheir being rational, but lead mere animal lives, making it their whole\r\nendeavour to kill in themselves all they have above beasts; to wit, the\r\nuse of reason, and taste of society. It is frequently boasted in the\r\nwritings of orators and poets, that it is to eloquence and poesy we owe\r\nthat we are drawn out of woods and solitudes into towns and cities, and\r\nfrom a wild and savage being become acquainted with the laws of humanity\r\nand civility. If we are obliged to these arts for so great service, I\r\ncould wish they were employed to give us a second turn; that as they\r\nhave brought us to dwell in society (a blessing which no other creatures\r\nknow), so they would persuade us, now they have settled us, to lay out\r\nall our thoughts in surpassing each other in those faculties in which\r\nonly we excel other creatures. But it is at present so far otherwise,\r\nthat the contention seems to be, who shall be most eminent in\r\nperformances wherein beasts enjoy greater abilities than we have. I'll\r\nundertake, were the butler and swineherd, at any true esquire's in Great\r\nBritain, to keep and compare accounts of what wash is drunk up in so\r\nmany hours in the parlour and the pigsty, it would appear, the gentleman\r\nof the house gives much more to his friends than his hogs.\r\n\r\nThis, with many other evils, arises from the error in men's judgments,\r\nand not making true distinctions between persons and things. It is\r\nusually thought, that a few sheets of parchment, made before a male and\r\nfemale of wealthy houses come together, give the heirs and descendants\r\nof that marriage possession of lands and tenements; but the truth is,\r\nthere is no man who can be said to be proprietor of an estate, but he\r\nwho knows how to enjoy it. Nay, it shall never be allowed, that the land\r\nis not a waste, when the master is uncultivated. Therefore, to avoid\r\nconfusion, it is to be noted, that a peasant with a great estate is but\r\nan incumbent, and that he must be a gentleman to be a landlord. A\r\nlandlord enjoys what he has with his heart, an incumbent with his\r\nstomach. Gluttony, drunkenness, and riot, are the entertainments of an\r\nincumbent; benevolence, civility, social and human virtues, the\r\naccomplishments of a landlord. Who, that has any passion for his native\r\ncountry, does not think it worse than conquered, when so large\r\ndiversions of it are in the hands of savages, that know no use of\r\nproperty but to be tyrants; or liberty, but to be unmannerly? A\r\ngentleman in a country life enjoys Paradise with a temper fit for it; a\r\nclown is cursed in it with all the cutting and unruly passions man could\r\nbe tormented with when he was expelled from it.\r\n\r\nThere is no character more deservedly esteemed than that of a country\r\ngentleman, who understands the station in which heaven and nature have\r\nplaced him. He is father to his tenants, and patron to his neighbours,\r\nand is more superior to those of lower fortune by his benevolence than\r\nhis possessions. He justly divides his time between solitude and\r\ncompany, so as to use the one for the other. His life is spent in the\r\ngood offices of an advocate, a referee, a companion, a mediator, and a\r\nfriend. His counsel and knowledge are a guard to the simplicity and\r\ninnocence of those of lower talents, and the entertainment and happiness\r\nof those of equal. When a man in a country life has this turn, as it is\r\nto be hoped thousands have, he lives in a more happy condition than any\r\nis described in the pastoral descriptions of poets, or the\r\nvainglorious solitudes recorded by philosophers.\r\n\r\nTo a thinking man it would seem prodigious, that the very situation in a\r\ncountry life does not incline men to a scorn of the mean gratifications\r\nsome take in it. To stand by a stream, naturally lulls the mind into\r\ncomposure and reverence; to walk in shades, diversifies that pleasure;\r\nand a bright sunshine makes a man consider all nature in gladness, and\r\nhimself the happiest being in it, as he is the most conscious of her\r\ngifts and enjoyments. It would be the most impertinent piece of\r\npedantry imaginable to form our pleasures by imitation of others. I will\r\nnot therefore mention Scipio and Lælius, who are generally produced on\r\nthis subject as authorities for the charms of a rural life. He that does\r\nnot feel the force of agreeable views and situations in his own mind,\r\nwill hardly arrive at the satisfactions they bring from the reflections\r\nof others. However, they who have a taste that way, are more\r\nparticularly inflamed with desire when they see others in the enjoyment\r\nof it, especially when men carry into the country a knowledge of the\r\nworld as well as of nature. The leisure of such persons is endeared and\r\nrefined by reflection upon cares and inquietudes. The absence of past\r\nlabours doubles present pleasures, which is still augmented, if the\r\nperson in solitude has the happiness of being addicted to letters. My\r\ncousin Frank Bickerstaff gives me a very good notion of this sort of\r\nfelicity in the following letter:\r\n\r\n     \"SIR,\r\n\r\n     \"I write this to communicate to you the happiness I have in the\r\n     neighbourhood and conversation of the noble lord whose health you\r\n     inquired after in your last. I have bought that little hovel which\r\n     borders upon his royalty; but am so far from being oppressed by his\r\n     greatness, that I who know no envy, and he who is above pride,\r\n     mutually recommend ourselves to each other by the difference of our\r\n     fortunes. He esteems me for being so well pleased with a little,\r\n     and I admire him for enjoying so handsomely a great deal. He has\r\n     not the little taste of observing the colour of a tulip, or the\r\n     edging of a leaf of box, but rejoices in open views, the regularity\r\n     of this plantation, and the wildness of another, as well as the\r\n     fall of a river, the rising of a promontory, and all other objects\r\n     fit to entertain a mind like his, that has been long versed in\r\n     great and public amusements. The make of the soul is as much seen\r\n     in leisure as in business. He has long lived in Courts, and been\r\n     admired in assemblies, so that he has added to experience a most\r\n     charming eloquence; by which he communicates to me the ideas of my\r\n     own mind upon the objects we meet with, so agreeably, that with his\r\n     company in the fields, I at once enjoy the country, and a landscape\r\n     of it. He is now altering the course of canals and rivulets, in\r\n     which he has an eye to his neighbour's satisfaction, as well as his\r\n     own.

I believed it a\r\nvery good office to the world, to sit down and show others the road in\r\nwhich I am experienced by my wanderings and errors. This is Seneca's way\r\nof thinking, and he had half convinced me, how dangerous it is to our\r\ntrue happiness and tranquillity to fix our minds upon anything which is\r\nin the power of Fortune. It is excusable only in animals who have not\r\nthe use of reason, to be catched by hooks and baits. Wealth, glory, and\r\npower, which the ordinary people look up at with admiration, the learned\r\nand wise know to be only so many snares laid to enslave them. There is\r\nnothing further to be sought for with earnestness, than what will clothe\r\nand feed us. If we pamper ourselves in our diet, or give our\r\nimaginations a loose in our desires, the body will no longer obey the\r\nmind. Let us think no further than to defend ourselves against hunger,\r\nthirst, and cold. We are to remember, that everything else is\r\ndespicable, and not worth our care. To want little is true grandeur, and\r\nvery few things are great to a great mind. Those who form their thoughts\r\nin this manner, and abstract themselves from the world, are out of the\r\nway of Fortune, and can look with contempt both on her favours and her\r\nfrowns. At the same time, they who separate themselves from the\r\nimmediate commerce with the busy part of mankind, are still beneficial\r\nto them, while by their studies and writings they recommend to them the\r\nsmall value which ought to be put upon what they pursue with so much\r\nlabour and disquiet. Whilst such men are thought the most idle, they are\r\nthe most usefully employed. They have all things, both human and divine,\r\nunder consideration. To be perfectly free from the insults of fortune,\r\nwe should arm ourselves with their reflections. We should learn, that\r\nnone but intellectual possessions are what we can properly call our own.\r\nAll things from without are but borrowed. What Fortune gives us, is not\r\nours; and whatever she gives, she can take away.\r\n\r\nIt is a common imputation to Seneca, that though he declaimed with so\r\nmuch strength of reason, and a stoical contempt of riches and power, he\r\nwas at the same time one of the richest and most powerful men in Rome. I\r\nknow no instance of his being insolent in that fortune, and can\r\ntherefore read his thoughts on those subjects with the more deference. I\r\nwill not give philosophy so poor a look, as to say it cannot live in\r\ncourts; but I am of opinion, that it is there in the greatest eminence,\r\nwhen amidst the affluence of all the world can bestow, and the addresses\r\nof a crowd who follow him for that reason, a man can think both of\r\nhimself and those about him abstracted from these circumstances. Such a\r\nphilosopher is as much above an anchorite, as a wise matron, who passes\r\nthrough the world with innocence, is preferable to the nun who locks\r\nherself up from it.\r\n\r\nFull of these thoughts I left my lodgings, and took a walk to the Court\r\nend of the town; and the hurry, and busy faces I met with about\r\nWhitehall, made me form to myself ideas of the different prospects of\r\nall I saw, from the turn and cast of their countenances. All, methought,\r\nhad the same thing in view, but prosecuted their hopes with a different\r\nair: some showed an unbecoming eagerness, some a surly impatience, some\r\na winning deference, but the generality a servile complaisance.\r\n\r\nI could not but observe, as I roved about the offices, that all who were\r\nstill but in expectation, murmured at Fortune; and all who had obtained\r\ntheir wishes, immediately began to say, there was no such being. Each\r\nbelieved it an act of blind chance that any other man was preferred, but\r\nowed only to service and merit what he had obtained himself. It is the\r\nfault of studious men to appear in public with too contemplative a\r\ncarriage; and I began to observe, that my figure, age, and dress, made\r\nme particular: for which reason I thought it better to remove a studious\r\ncountenance from among busy ones, and take a turn with a friend in the\r\nPrivy Garden.[259]\r\n\r\nWhen my friend was alone with me there, \"Isaac,\" said he, \"I know you\r\ncame abroad only to moralise and make observations, and I will carry you\r\nhard by, where you shall see all that you have yourself considered or\r\nread in authors, or collected from experience, concerning blind Fortune\r\nand irresistible Destiny, illustrated in real persons and proper\r\nmechanisms. The Graces, the Muses, the Fates, all the beings which have\r\na good or evil influence upon human life, are, you'll say, very justly\r\nfigured in the persons of women; and where I am carrying you, you'll see\r\nenough of that sex together, in an employment which will have so\r\nimportant an effect upon those who are to receive their manufacture, as\r\nwill make them be respectively called Deities or Furies, as their labour\r\nshall prove disadvantageous or successful to their votaries.\" Without\r\nwaiting for my answer, he carried me to an apartment contiguous to the\r\nBanqueting House, where there were placed at two long tables a large\r\ncompany of young women, in decent and agreeable habits, making up\r\ntickets for the lottery appointed by the Government. There walked\r\nbetween the tables a person who presided over the work. This gentlewoman\r\nseemed an emblem of Fortune, she commanded as if unconcerned in their\r\nbusiness; and though everything was performed by her direction, she did\r\nnot visibly interpose in particulars. She seemed in pain at our near\r\napproach to her, and most to approve us, when we made her no advances.\r\nHer height, her mien, her gesture, her shape, and her countenance, had\r\nsomething that spoke both familiarity and dignity. She therefore\r\nappeared to me not only a picture of Fortune, but of Fortune as I liked\r\nher; which made me break out in the following words:\r\n\r\n     \"MADAM,\r\n\r\n     \"I am very glad to see the fate of the many who now languish in\r\n     expectation of what will be the event of your labours in the hands\r\n     of one who can act with so impartial an indifference. Pardon me,\r\n     that have often seen you before, and have lost you for want of the\r\n     respect due to you. Let me beg of you, who have both the furnishing\r\n     and turning of that wheel of lots, to be unlike the rest of your\r\n     sex, repulse the forward and the bold, and favour the modest and\r\n     the humble. I know you fly the importunate, but smile no more on\r\n     the careless. Add not to the coffers of the usurer, but give the\r\n     power of bestowing to the generous. Continue his wants who cannot\r\n     enjoy or communicate plenty; but turn away his poverty, who can\r\n     bear it with more ease than he can see it in another.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT.\r\n\r\nWhereas Philander signified to Clarinda by letter bearing date Thursday\r\n12 o'clock, that he had lost his heart by a shot from her eyes, and\r\ndesired she would condescend to meet him the same day at eight in the\r\nevening at Rosamond's Pond,[260] faithfully protesting, that in case she\r\nwould not do him that honour, she might see the body of the said\r\nPhilander the next day floating on the said lake of Love, and that he\r\ndesired only three sighs upon view of his said body: it is desired, if\r\nhe has not made away with himself accordingly, that he would forthwith\r\nshow himself to the coroner of the city of Westminster; or Clarinda,\r\nbeing an old offender, will be found guilty of wilful murder.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 259: Now Whitehall Gardens, between Parliament Street and the\r\nThames.

This way of fixing\r\nappellations of credit upon eminent merit, was what gave being to titles\r\nand terms of honour. \"Such a name,\" continued he, \"without the qualities\r\nwhich should give a man pretence to be exalted above others, does but\r\nturn him to jest and ridicule. Should one see another cudgelled, or\r\nscurvily treated, do you think a man so used would take it kindly to be\r\ncalled Hector, or Alexander? Everything must bear a proportion with the\r\noutward value that is set upon it; or instead of being long had in\r\nveneration, that very term of esteem will become a word of reproach.\"\r\nWhen Timoleon had done speaking, Urbanus pursued the same purpose, by\r\ngiving an account of the manner in which the Indian kings,[261] who were\r\nlately in Great Britain, did honour to the person where they lodged.\r\n\"They were placed,\" said he, \"in a handsome apartment, at an\r\nupholsterer's in King Street, Covent Garden. The man of the house, it\r\nseems, had been very observant of them, and ready in their service.\r\nThese just and generous princes, who act according to the dictates of\r\nnatural justice, thought it proper to confer some dignity upon their\r\nlandlord before they left his house. One of them had been sick during\r\nhis residence there, and having never before been in a bed, had a very\r\ngreat veneration for him who made that engine of repose, so useful and\r\nso necessary in his distress. It was consulted among the four princes,\r\nby what name to dignify his great merit and services. The Emperor of the\r\nMohocks, and the other three kings, stood up, and in that posture\r\nrecounted the civilities they had received, and particularly repeated\r\nthe care which was taken of their sick brother. This, in their\r\nimagination, who are used to know the injuries of weather, and the\r\nvicissitudes of cold and heat, gave them very great impressions of a\r\nskilful upholsterer, whose furniture was so well contrived for their\r\nprotection on such occasions. It is with these less instructed (I will\r\nnot say less knowing) people, the manner of doing honour, to impose some\r\nname significant of the qualities of the person they distinguish, and\r\nthe good offices received from him. It was therefore resolved, to call\r\ntheir landlord Cadaroque, which is the name of the strongest fort in\r\ntheir part of the world. When they had agreed upon the name, they sent\r\nfor their landlord, and as he entered into their presence, the Emperor\r\nof the Mohocks taking him by the hand, called him Cadaroque. After which\r\nthe other three princes repeated the same word and ceremony.\"\r\n\r\nTimoleon appeared much satisfied with this account, and having a\r\nphilosophic turn, began to argue against the modes and manners of those\r\nnations which we esteem polite, and express himself with disdain at our\r\nusual method of calling such as are strangers to our innovations,\r\nbarbarous. \"I have,\" says he, \"so great a deference for the distinction\r\ngiven by these princes, that Cadaroque shall be my upholsterer----\" He\r\nwas going on, but the intended discourse was interrupted by Minucio, who\r\nsat near him, a small philosopher, who is also somewhat of a politician;\r\none of those who sets up for knowledge by doubting, and has no other way\r\nof making himself considerable, but by contradicting all he hears said.\r\nHe has, besides much doubt and spirit of contradiction, a constant\r\nsuspicion as to State affairs. This accomplished gentleman, with a very\r\nawful brow, and a countenance full of weight, told Timoleon, that it was\r\na great misfortune men of letters seldom looked into the bottom of\r\nthings. \"Will any man,\" continued he, \"persuade me, that this was not\r\nfrom the beginning to the end a concerted affair? Who can convince the\r\nworld, that four kings shall come over here, and lie at the Two Crowns\r\nand Cushion,[262] and one of them fall sick, and the place be called\r\nKing Street, and all this by mere accident? No, no: to a man of very\r\nsmall penetration, it appears, that Tee Yee Neen Ho Ga Row, Emperor of\r\nthe Mohocks, was prepared for this adventure beforehand. I do not care\r\nto contradict any gentleman in his discourse; but I must say, however,\r\nSa Ga Yeath Rua Geth Ton, and E Tow Oh Koam, might be surprised in this\r\nmatter; nevertheless, Ho Nee Yeth Taw No Row knew it before he set foot\r\non the English shore.\"\r\n\r\nTimoleon looked steadfastly at him for some time, then shaked his head,\r\npaid for his tea, and marched off. Several others who sat around him,\r\nwere in their turns attacked by this ready disputant. A gentleman who\r\nwas at some distance, happened in discourse to say it was four miles to\r\nHammersmith. \"I must beg your pardon,\" says Minucio, \"when we say a\r\nplace is so far off, we do not mean exactly from the very spot of earth\r\nwe are in, but from the town where we are; so that you must begin your\r\naccount from the end of Piccadilly; and if you do so, I'll lay any man\r\nten to one, it is not above three good miles off.\" Another, about\r\nMinucio's level of understanding, began to take him up in this important\r\nargument, and maintained, that considering the way from Pimlico at the\r\nend of St. James's Park, and the crossing from Chelsea by Earl's Court,\r\nhe would stand to it, that it was full four miles. But Minucio replied\r\nwith great vehemence, and seemed so much to have the better of the\r\ndispute, that this adversary quitted the field, as well as the other. I\r\nsat till I saw the table almost all vanished, where, for want of\r\ndiscourse, Minucio asked me, how I did? To which I answered, \"Very\r\nwell.\" \"That's very much,\" said he; \"I assure you, you look paler than\r\nordinary.\" \"Nay,\" thought I, \"if he won't allow me to know whether I am\r\nwell or not, there is no staying for me neither.\" Upon which I took my\r\nleave, pondering as I went home at this strange poverty of imagination,\r\nwhich makes men run into the fault of giving contradiction. They want in\r\ntheir minds entertainment for themselves or their company, and therefore\r\nbuild all they speak upon what is started by others; and since they\r\ncannot improve that foundation, they strive to destroy it. The only way\r\nof dealing with these people is to answer in monosyllables, or by way of\r\nquestion. When one of them tells you a thing that he thinks\r\nextraordinary, I go no further than, \"Say you so, sir? Indeed! Heyday!\"\r\nor \"Is it come to that!\" These little rules, which appear but silly in\r\nthe repetition, have brought me with great tranquillity to this age. And\r\nI have made it an observation, that as assent is more agreeable than\r\nflattery, so contradiction is more odious than culumny.\r\n\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT.\r\n\r\nMr. Bickerstaff's aërial messenger has brought him a report of what\r\npassed at the auction of pictures which was in Somerset House Yard on\r\nMonday last, and finds there were no \"screens\" present, but all\r\ntransacted with great justice.\r\n\r\nN.B.

However, this is very much\r\nto be helped by circumspection, and a constant alarm against the first\r\nonsets of passion. As this is in general a necessary care to make a\r\nman's life easy and agreeable to himself, so it is more particularly the\r\nduty of such as are engaged in friendship and more near commerce with\r\nothers. Those who have their joys, have also their griefs in proportion,\r\nand none can extremely exalt or depress friends, but friends. The harsh\r\nthings which come from the rest of the world, are received and repulsed\r\nwith that spirit which every honest man bears for his own vindication;\r\nbut unkindness in words or actions among friends, affects us at the\r\nfirst instant in the inmost recesses of our souls. Indifferent people,\r\nif I may so say, can wound us only in heterogeneous parts, maim us in\r\nour legs or arms; but the friend can make no pass but at the heart\r\nitself. On the other side, the most impotent assistance, the mere\r\nwell-wishes of a friend, gives a man constancy and courage against the\r\nmost prevailing force of his enemies. It is here only a man enjoys and\r\nsuffers to the quick. For this reason, the most gentle behaviour is\r\nabsolutely necessary to maintain friendship in any degree above the\r\ncommon level of acquaintance. But there is a relation of life much more\r\nnear than the most strict and sacred friendship, that is to say,\r\nmarriage. This union is of too close and delicate a nature to be easily\r\nconceived by those who do not know that condition by experience. Here a\r\nman should, if possible, soften his passions; if not for his own ease,\r\nin compliance to a creature formed with a mind of a quite different make\r\nfrom his own. I am sure, I do not mean it an injury to women, when I say\r\nthere is a sort of sex in souls. I am tender of offending them, and know\r\nit is hard not to do it on this subject; but I must go on to say, that\r\nthe soul of a man and that of a woman are made very unlike, according to\r\nthe employments for which they are designed. The ladies will please to\r\nobserve, I say, our minds have different, not superior qualities to\r\ntheirs. The virtues have respectively a masculine and a feminine cast.\r\nWhat we call in men wisdom, is in women prudence. It is a partiality to\r\ncall one greater than the other. A prudent woman is in the same class of\r\nhonour as a wise man, and the scandals in the way of both are equally\r\ndangerous. But to make this state anything but a burden, and not hang a\r\nweight upon our very beings, it is very proper each of the couple should\r\nfrequently remember, that there are many things which grow out of their\r\nvery natures that are pardonable, nay becoming, when considered as such,\r\nbut without that reflection must give the quickest pain and vexation. To\r\nmanage well a great family is as worthy an instance of capacity, as to\r\nexecute a great employment; and for the generality, as women perform the\r\nconsiderable part of their duties as well as men do theirs, so in their\r\ncommon behaviour, those of ordinary genius are not more trivial than the\r\ncommon rate of men; and in my opinion, the playing of a fan is every\r\nwhit as good an entertainment as the beating a snuff-box.\r\n\r\nBut however I have rambled in this libertine manner of writing by way of\r\nessay, I now sat down with an intention to represent to my readers, how\r\npernicious, how sudden, and how fatal surprises of passion are to the\r\nmind of man; and that in the more intimate commerces of life they are\r\nmost liable to arise, even in our most sedate and indolent hours.\r\nOccurrences of this kind have had very terrible effects; and when one\r\nreflects upon them, we cannot but tremble to consider what we are\r\ncapable of being wrought up to against all the ties of nature, love,\r\nhonour, reason, and religion, though the man who breaks through them\r\nall, had, an hour before he did so, a lively and virtuous sense of their\r\ndictates. When unhappy catastrophes make up part of the history of\r\nprinces, and persons who act in high spheres, or are represented in the\r\nmoving language and well-wrought scenes of tragedians, they do not fail\r\nof striking us with terror; but then they affect us only in a transient\r\nmanner, and pass through our imaginations, as incidents in which our\r\nfortunes are too humble to be concerned, or which writers form for the\r\nostentation of their own force; or, at most, as things fit rather to\r\nexercise the powers of our minds, than to create new habits in them.\r\nInstead of such high passages, I was thinking it would be of great use\r\n(if anybody could hit it) to lay before the world such adventures as\r\nbefall persons not exalted above the common level. This, methought,\r\nwould better prevail upon the ordinary race of men, who are so\r\nprepossessed with outward appearances, that they mistake fortune for\r\nnature, and believe nothing can relate to them that does not happen to\r\nsuch as live and look like themselves.\r\n\r\nThe unhappy end of a gentleman whose story an acquaintance of mine was\r\njust now telling me, would be very proper for this end if it could be\r\nrelated with all the circumstances as I heard it this evening; for it\r\ntouched me so much, that I cannot forbear entering upon it.\r\n\r\nMr. Eustace,[263] a young gentleman of a good estate near Dublin in\r\nIreland, married a lady of youth, beauty, and modesty, and lived with\r\nher in general with much ease and tranquillity; but was in his secret\r\ntemper impatient of rebuke: she is apt to fall into little sallies of\r\npassion, yet as suddenly recalled by her own reflection on her fault,\r\nand the consideration of her husband's temper. It happened, as he, his\r\nwife, and her sister, were at supper together about two months ago, that\r\nin the midst of a careless and familiar conversation, the sisters fell\r\ninto a little warmth and contradiction. He, who was one of that sort of\r\nmen who are never unconcerned at what passes before them, fell into an\r\noutrageous passion on the side of the sister. The person about whom they\r\ndisputed was so near, that they were under no restraint from running\r\ninto vain repetitions of past heats: on which occasion all the\r\naggravations of anger and distaste boiled up, and were repeated with the\r\nbitterness of exasperated lovers. The wife observing her husband\r\nextremely moved, began to turn it off, and rally him for interposing\r\nbetween two people who from their infancy had been angry and pleased\r\nwith each other every half-hour. But it descended deeper into his\r\nthoughts, and they broke up with a sullen silence. The wife immediately\r\nretired to her chamber, whither her husband soon after followed. When\r\nthey were in bed, he soon dissembled a sleep, and she, pleased that his\r\nthoughts were composed, fell into a real one. Their apartment was very\r\ndistant from the rest of their family, in a lonely country house. He now\r\nsaw his opportunity, and with a dagger he had brought to bed with him,\r\nstabbed his wife in the side. She awaked in the highest terror; but\r\nimmediately imagined it was a blow designed for her husband by ruffians,\r\nbegan to grasp him, and strive to awake and rouse him to defend himself.\r\nHe still pretended himself sleeping, and gave her a second wound.\r\n\r\nShe now drew open the curtains, and by the help of moonlight saw his\r\nhand lifted up to stab her. The horror disarmed her from further\r\nstruggling; and he, enraged anew at being discovered, fixed his poniard\r\nin her bosom. As soon as he believed he had despatched her, he attempted\r\nto escape out of the window: but she, still alive, called to him not to\r\nhurt himself; for she might live. He was so stung with the insupportable\r\nreflection upon her goodness and his own villainy, that he jumped to the\r\nbed, and wounded her all over with as much rage as if every blow was\r\nprovoked by new aggravations. In this fury of mind he fled away. His\r\nwife had still strength to go to her sister's apartment, and give her an\r\naccount of this wonderful tragedy; but died the next day. Some weeks\r\nafter, an officer of justice, in attempting to seize the criminal, fired\r\nupon him, as did the criminal upon the officer. Both their balls took\r\nplace, and both immediately expired.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 263: \"Last Sunday Mr. Francis Eustace committed a most\r\nbarbarous murder on the body of his wife, by giving her seven or eight\r\nstabs with his sword, of which she died instantly.

By this means I was for defending my head when the French\r\ngentleman was making a full pass at my bosom, insomuch that he told me I\r\nwas fairly killed seven times in one morning, without having done my\r\nmaster any other mischief than one knock on the pate. This was a great\r\nmisfortune to me; and I believe I may say, without vanity, I am the\r\nfirst who ever pushed so erroneously, and yet conquered the prejudice of\r\neducation so well, as to make my passes so clear, and recover hand and\r\nfoot with that agility, as I do at this day. The truth of it is, the\r\nfirst rudiments of education are given very indiscreetly by most\r\nparents, as much with relation to the more important concerns of the\r\nmind, as in the gestures of the body. Whatever children are designed\r\nfor, and whatever prospects the fortune or interest of their parents may\r\ngive them in their future lives, they are all promiscuously instructed\r\nthe same way; and Horace and Virgil must be thrummed by a boy as well\r\nbefore he goes to an apprenticeship as to the University. This\r\nridiculous way of treating the under-aged of this island has very often\r\nraised both my spleen and mirth, but I think never both at once so much\r\nas to-day. A good mother of our neighbourhood made me a visit with her\r\nson and heir, a lad somewhat above five foot, and wants but little of\r\nthe height and strength of a good musketeer in any regiment in the\r\nservice. Her business was to desire I would examine him, for he was far\r\ngone in a book, the first letters of which she often saw in my papers.\r\nThe youth produced it, and I found it was my friend Horace. It was very\r\neasy to turn to the place the boy was learning in, which was the fifth\r\nOde of the first Book, to Pyrrha. I read it over aloud, as well because\r\nI am always delighted when I turn to the beautiful parts of that author,\r\nas also to gain time for considering a little how to keep up the\r\nmother's pleasure in her child, which I thought barbarity to interrupt.\r\nIn the first place I asked him, who this same Pyrrha was? He answered\r\nvery readily, she was the wife of Pyrrhus, one of Alexander's captains.\r\nI lifted up my hands. The mother curtsies. \"Nay,\" says she, \"I knew you\r\nwould stand in admiration.\"----\"I assure you,\" continued she, \"for all\r\nhe looks so tall, he is but very young. Pray ask him some more, never\r\nspare him.\" With that I took the liberty to ask him, what was the\r\ncharacter of this gentlewoman? He read the three first verses:\r\n\r\n    _Quis multa gracilis te puer in rosa\r\n    Perfusus liquidis urget odoribus,\r\n        Grato, Pyrrha, sub antro?_[266]\r\n\r\nand very gravely told me, she lived at the sign of the Rose in a cellar.\r\nI took care to be very much astonished at the lad's improvements; but\r\nwithal advised her, as soon as possible, to take him from school, for he\r\ncould learn no more there. This very silly dialogue was a lively image\r\nof the impertinent method used in breeding boys without genius or\r\nspirit, to the reading things for which their heads were never framed.\r\nBut this is the natural effect of a certain vanity in the minds of\r\nparents, who are wonderfully delighted with the thought of breeding\r\ntheir children to accomplishments, which they believe nothing but want\r\nof the same care in their own fathers prevented them from being masters\r\nof. Thus it is, that the part of life most fit for improvement is\r\ngenerally employed in a method against the bent of Nature; and a lad of\r\nsuch parts as are fit for an occupation, where there can be no calls out\r\nof the beaten path, is two or three years of his time wholly taken up in\r\nknowing how well Ovid's mistress became such a dress; how such a nymph\r\nfor her cruelty was changed into such an animal; and how it is made\r\ngenerous in Æneas to put Turnus to death, gallantries that can no more\r\ncome within the occurrences of the lives of ordinary men, than they can\r\nbe relished by their imaginations. However, still the humour goes on\r\nfrom one generation to another; and the pastrycook here in the lane the\r\nother night told me, he would not yet take away his son from his\r\nlearning, but has resolved, as soon as he had a little smattering in the\r\nGreek, to put him apprentice to a soap-boiler. These wrong beginnings\r\ndetermine our success in the world; and when our thoughts are originally\r\nfalsely biased, their agility and force do but carry us the further out\r\nof our way in proportion to our speed. But we are half-way our journey\r\nwhen we have got into the right road. If all our days were usefully\r\nemployed, and we did not set out impertinently, we should not have so\r\nmany grotesque professors in all the arts of life, but every man would\r\nbe in a proper and becoming method of distinguishing or entertaining\r\nhimself suitably to what Nature designed him. As they go on now, our\r\nparents do not only force us upon what is against our talents, but our\r\nteachers are also as injudicious in what they put us to learn. I have\r\nhardly ever since suffered so much by the charms of any beauty, as I did\r\nbefore I had a sense of passion, for not apprehending that the smile of\r\nLalage was what pleased Horace;[267] and I verily believe, the stripes I\r\nsuffered about _digito male pertinaci_[268] has given that\r\nirreconcilable aversion, which I shall carry to my grave, against\r\ncoquettes.\r\n\r\nAs for the elegant writer of whom I am talking, his excellences are to\r\nbe observed as they relate to the different concerns of his life; and he\r\nis always to be looked upon as a lover, a courtier, or a man of wit. His\r\nadmirable odes have numberless instances of his merit in each of these\r\ncharacters. His epistles and satires are full of proper notices for the\r\nconduct of life in a Court; and what we call good breeding, most\r\nagreeably intermixed with his morality. His addresses to the persons who\r\nfavour him are so inimitably engaging, that Augustus complained of him\r\nfor so seldom writing to him, and asked him, whether he was afraid\r\nposterity should read their names together? Now for the generality of\r\nmen to spend much time in such writings, is as pleasant a folly as any\r\nhe ridicules. Whatever the crowd of scholars may pretend, if their way\r\nof life, or their own imaginations, do not lead them to a taste of him,\r\nthey may read, nay write, fifty volumes upon him, and be just as they\r\nwere when they began. I remember to have heard a great painter say,\r\nthere are certain faces for certain painters, as well as certain\r\nsubjects for certain poets. This is as true in the choice of studies,\r\nand no one will ever relish an author thoroughly well, who would not\r\nhave been fit company for that author had they lived at the same time.\r\nAll others are mechanics in learning, and take the sentiments of writers\r\nlike waiting-servants, who report what passed at their master's table;\r\nbut debase every thought and expression, for want of the air with which\r\nthey were uttered.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 264: Fence.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 265: Hence the phrase, \"a knock-down argument.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 266: Horace, 1 Od. v. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 267: See 1 Od. xxii. 23:\r\n\r\n    \"Dulce ridentem Lalagen amabo,\r\n        Dulce loquentem.\"\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 268: Horace, 1 Od. ix. 24.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 174.

This particularity renders him either venerable or ridiculous,\r\naccording as he uses his talents, which always grow out into faults, or\r\nimprove into virtues. In the office I have undertaken, you are to\r\nobserve, that I have hitherto presented only the more insignificant and\r\nlazy part of mankind under the denomination of \"dead men,\" together with\r\nthe degrees towards non-existence, in which others can neither be said\r\nto live nor be defunct, but are only animals merely dressed up like men,\r\nand differ from each other but as flies do by a little colouring or\r\nfluttering of their wings. Now as our discourses heretofore have chiefly\r\nregarded the indolent part of the species, it remains that we do justice\r\nalso upon the impertinently active and enterprising. Such as these I\r\nshall take particular care to place in safe custody, and have used all\r\npossible diligence to run up my edifice in Moorfields for that\r\nservice.[269]\r\n\r\nWe who are adept in astrology, can impute it to several causes in the\r\nplanets, that this quarter of our great city is the region of such\r\npersons as either never had, or have lost, the use of reason. It has\r\nindeed been time out of mind the receptacle of fools as well as madmen.\r\nThe care and information of the former I assign to other learned men,\r\nwho have for that end taken up their habitation in those parts; as,\r\namong others, to the famous Dr. Trotter, and my ingenious friend Dr.\r\nLangham.[270] These oraculous proficients are day and night employed in\r\ndeep searches, for the direction of such as run astray after their lost\r\ngoods: but at present they are more particularly serviceable to their\r\ncountry, in foretelling the fate of such as have chances in the public\r\nlottery. Dr. Langham shows a peculiar generosity on this occasion,\r\ntaking only one half-crown for a prediction, eighteenpence of which to\r\nbe paid out of the prizes; which method the doctor is willing to comply\r\nwith in favour of every adventurer in the whole lottery. Leaving\r\ntherefore the whole generation of such inquirers to such _literati_ as I\r\nhave now mentioned, we are to proceed towards peopling our house, which\r\nwe have erected with the greatest cost and care imaginable.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary in this place to premise, that the superiority and force\r\nof mind which is born with men of great genius, and which, when it falls\r\nin with a noble imagination, is called \"poetical fury,\" does not come\r\nunder my consideration; but the pretence to such an impulse without\r\nnatural warmth, shall be allowed a fit object of this charity; and all\r\nthe volumes written by such hands shall be from time to time placed in\r\nproper order upon the rails of the unhoused booksellers within the\r\ndistrict of the college[271] (who have long inhabited this quarter), in\r\nthe same manner as they are already disposed soon after their\r\npublication. I promise myself from these writings my best opiates for\r\nthose patients whose high imaginations, and hot spirits, have waked them\r\ninto distraction. Their boiling tempers are not to be wrought upon by my\r\ngruels and juleps, but must ever be employed, or appear to be so, or\r\ntheir recovery will be impracticable. I shall therefore make use of such\r\npoets as preserve so constant a mediocrity as never to elevate the mind\r\ninto joy, or depress it into sadness, yet at the same time keep the\r\nfaculties of the readers in suspense, though they introduce no ideas of\r\ntheir own. By this means, a disordered mind, like a broken limb, will\r\nrecover its strength by the sole benefit of being out of use, and lying\r\nwithout motion. But as reading is not an entertainment that can take up\r\nthe full time of my patients, I have now in pension a proportionable\r\nnumber of storytellers, who are by turns to walk about the galleries of\r\nthe house, and by their narrations second the labours of my pretty good\r\npoets. There are among these storytellers some that have so earnest\r\ncountenances, and weighty brows, that they will draw a madman, even when\r\nhis fit is just coming on, into a whisper, and by the force of shrugs,\r\nnods, and busy gestures, make him stand amazed so long as that we may\r\nhave time to give him his broth without danger.\r\n\r\nBut as Fortune has the possession of men's minds, a physician may cure\r\nall the sick people of ordinary degree in the whole town, and never come\r\ninto reputation. I shall therefore begin with persons of condition; and\r\nthe first I shall undertake, shall be the Lady Fidget, the general\r\nvisitant, and Will Voluble, the fine talker. These persons shall be\r\nfirst locked up, for the peace of all whom the one visits, and all whom\r\nthe other talks to.\r\n\r\nThe passion which first touched the brain of both these persons was\r\nenvy; and has had such wondrous effects, that to this, Lady Fidget owes\r\nthat she is so courteous; to this, Will Voluble that he is eloquent.\r\nFidget has a restless torment in hearing of any one's prosperity, and\r\ncannot know any quiet till she visits her, and is eyewitness of\r\nsomething that lessens it. Thus her life is a continual search after\r\nwhat does not concern her, and her companions speak kindly even of the\r\nabsent and the unfortunate, to tease her. She was the first that visited\r\nFlavia after the small-pox, and has never seen her since because she is\r\nnot altered. Call a young woman handsome in her company, and she tells\r\nyou, it is a pity she has no fortune: say she is rich, and she is as\r\nsorry that she is silly. With all this ill nature, Fidget is herself\r\nyoung, rich, and handsome; but loses the pleasure of all those\r\nqualities, because she has them in common with others.\r\n\r\nTo make up her misery, she is well-bred, she hears commendations till\r\nshe is ready to faint for want of venting herself in contradictions.\r\nThis madness is not expressed by the voice; but is uttered in the eyes\r\nand features: its first symptom is upon beholding an agreeable object, a\r\nsudden approbation immediately checked with dislike.\r\n\r\nThis lady I shall take the liberty to conduct into a bed of straw and\r\ndarkness, and have some hopes, that after long absence from the light,\r\nthe pleasure of seeing at all may reconcile her to what she shall see,\r\nthough it proves to be never so agreeable.\r\n\r\nMy physical remarks on the distraction of envy in other persons, and\r\nparticularly in Will Voluble, is interrupted by a visit from Mr.\r\nKidney,[272] with advices which will bring matter of new disturbance to\r\nmany possessed with this sort of disorder, which I shall publish to\r\nbring out the symptoms more kindly, and lay the distemper more open to\r\nmy view.\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. James's Coffee-house, May 19._\r\n\r\nThis evening a mail from Holland brought the following advices:\r\n\r\n     From the Camp before Douay,[273] May 26, N.S. On the 23rd the\r\n     French assembled their army, and encamped with their right near\r\n     Bouchain, and their left near Crevecoeur. Upon this motion of the\r\n     enemy, the Duke of Marlborough and Prince Eugene made a movement\r\n     with their army on the 24th, and encamped from Arlieux to Vitry\r\n     and Isez-Esquerchien, where they are so advantageously posted, that\r\n     they not only cover the siege, secure our convoys of provisions,\r\n     forage, and ammunition, from Lille and Tournay, and the canals and\r\n     dykes we have made to turn the water of the Scarp and La Cense to\r\n     Bouchain; but are in a readiness, by marching from the right, to\r\n     possess themselves of the field of battle marked out betwixt Vitry\r\n     and Montigny, or from the left to gain the lines of circumvallation\r\n     betwixt Fierin and Dechy: so that whatever way the enemy shall\r\n     approach to attack us, whether by the plains of Lens, or by\r\n     Bouchain and Valenciennes, we have but a very small movement to\r\n     make, to possess ourselves of the ground on which it will be most\r\n     advantageous to receive them. The enemy marched this morning from\r\n     their left, and are encamped with their right at Oisy, and their\r\n     left towards Arras, and, according to our advices, will pass the\r\n     Scarp to-morrow, and enter on the plains of Lens, though several\r\n     regiments of horse, the German and Liège troops, which are destined\r\n     to compose part of their army, have not yet joined them. If they\r\n     pass the Scarp, we shall do the like at the same time, to possess\r\n     ourselves with all possible advantage of the field of battle: but\r\n     if they continue where they are, we shall not remove, because in\r\n     our present station we sufficiently cover from all insults both our\r\n     siege and convoys.\r\n\r\n     Monsieur Villars cannot yet go without crutches, and it is believed\r\n     will have much difficulty to ride. He and the Duke of Berwick are\r\n     to command the French army, the rest of the marshals being only to\r\n     assist in council.\r\n\r\n     Last night we entirely perfected four bridges over the _avant\r\n     fossé_ at both attacks; and our saps are so far advanced, that in\r\n     three or four days batteries will be raised on the _glacis_, to\r\n     batter in breach both the outworks and ramparts of the town.\r\n\r\n     Letters from the Hague of the 27th, N.S., say, that the Deputies of\r\n     the States of Holland, who set out for Gertruydenburg on the 23rd,\r\n     to renew the conferences with the French Ministers, returned on the\r\n     26th, and had communicated to the States-General the new overtures\r\n     that were made on the part of France, which it is believed, if they\r\n     are in earnest, may produce a general treaty.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 269: See Nos. 125, 127, 175.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 270: Two of the numerous astrologers who lived in Moorfields.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 271: During the first half of the eighteenth century the walls\r\nof Bedlam were made use of by dealers in second-hand books.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 272: The waiter; see No. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 273: Douay capitulated on the 25th of June, after a fifty-four\r\ndays siege, which cost the Allies eight thousand men.

[STEELE.\r\n\r\nFrom _Saturday, May 20_, to _Tuesday, May 23, 1710_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, May 22._\r\n\r\nIn the distribution of the apartments in the new Bedlam, proper regard\r\nis had to the different sexes, and the lodgings accommodated\r\naccordingly. Among other necessaries, as I have thought fit to appoint\r\nstorytellers to soothe the men, so I have allowed tale-bearers to\r\nindulge the intervals of my female patients. But before I enter upon\r\ndisposing of the main of the great body that wants my assistance, it is\r\nnecessary to consider the human race abstracted from all other\r\ndistinctions and considerations except that of sex. This will lead us to\r\na nearer view of their excellences and imperfections, which are to be\r\naccounted the one or the other, as they are suitable to the design for\r\nwhich the persons so defective or accomplished came into the world.\r\n\r\nTo make this inquiry aright, we must speak of the life of people of\r\ncondition, and the proportionable applications to those below them will\r\nbe easily made, so as to value the whole species by the same rule. We\r\nwill begin with the woman, and behold her as a virgin in her father's\r\nhouse. This state of her life is infinitely more delightful than that\r\nof her brother at the same age. While she is entertained with learning\r\nmelodious airs at her spinet, is led round a room in the most\r\ncomplaisant manner to a fiddle, who is entertained with applauses of her\r\nbeauty and perfection in the ordinary conversation she meets with: the\r\nyoung man is under the dictates of a rigid schoolmaster or instructor,\r\ncontradicted in every word he speaks, and curbed in all the inclinations\r\nhe discovers. Mrs. Elizabeth is the object of desire and admiration,\r\nlooked upon with delight, courted with all the powers of eloquence and\r\naddress, approached with a certain worship, and defended with a certain\r\nloyalty. This is her case as to the world: in her domestic character,\r\nshe is the companion, the friend, and confidante of her mother, and the\r\nobject of a pleasure something like the love between angels, to her\r\nfather. Her youth, her beauty, her air, are by him looked upon with an\r\nineffable transport beyond any other joy in this life, with as much\r\npurity as can be met with in the next.\r\n\r\nHer brother William, at the same years, is but in the rudiments of those\r\nacquisitions which must gain him esteem in the world. His heart beats\r\nfor applause among men, yet is he fearful of every step towards it. If\r\nhe proposes to himself to make a figure in the world, his youth is\r\ndamped with a prospect of difficulties, dangers, and dishonours; and an\r\nopposition in all generous attempts, whether they regard his love or his\r\nambition.\r\n\r\nIn the next stage of life she has little else to do, but (what she is\r\naccomplished for by the mere gifts of nature) to appear lovely and\r\nagreeable to her husband, tender to her children, and affable to her\r\nservants: but a man, when he enters into this way, is but in the first\r\nscene, far from the accomplishment of his designs. He is now in all\r\nthings to act for others as well as himself. He is to have industry and\r\nfrugality in his private affairs, and integrity and addresses in public.\r\nTo these qualities, he must add a courage and resolution to support his\r\nother abilities, lest he be interrupted in the prosecution of his just\r\nendeavours, in which the honour and interest of posterity are as much\r\nconcerned as his own personal welfare.\r\n\r\nThis little sketch may in some measure give an idea of the different\r\nparts which the sexes have to act, and the advantageous as well as\r\ninconvenient terms on which they are to enter upon their several parts\r\nof life. This may also be some rule to us in the examination of their\r\nconduct. In short, I shall take it for a maxim, that a woman who resigns\r\nthe purpose of being pleasing, and the man who gives up the thoughts of\r\nbeing wise, do equally quit their claim to the true causes of living;\r\nand are to be allowed the diet and discipline of my charitable structure\r\nto reduce them to reason.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, the woman who hopes to please by methods which should\r\nmake her odious, and the man who would be thought wise by a behaviour\r\nthat renders him ridiculous, are to be taken into custody for their\r\nfalse industry, as justly as they ought for their negligence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nN.B. Mr. Bickerstaff is taken extremely ill with the toothache, and\r\ncannot proceed in this discourse.\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. James's Coffee-house, May 22._\r\n\r\nAdvices from Flanders of the 30th instant, N.S., say, that the Duke of\r\nMarlborough having intelligence of the enemy's passing the Scarp on the\r\n29th in the evening, and their march towards the plains of Lens, had put\r\nthe Confederate army in motion, which was advancing towards the camp on\r\nthe north side of that river between Vitry and Henin-Lietard. The\r\nConfederates, since the approach of the enemy, have added several new\r\nredoubts to their camp, and drawn the cannon out of the lines of\r\ncircumvallation in a readiness for the batteries.\r\n\r\nIt is not believed, notwithstanding these appearances, that the enemy\r\nwill hazard a battle for the relief of Douay; the siege of which place\r\nis carried on with all the success that can be expected, considering the\r\ndifficulties they meet with occasioned by the inundations. On the 28th\r\nat night we made a lodgment on the salient angle of the glacis of the\r\nsecond counterscarp, and our approaches are so far advanced, that it is\r\nbelieved the town will be obliged to surrender before the 8th of the\r\nnext month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 176.                                                     [STEELE.\r\n\r\nFrom _Tuesday, May 23_, to _Thursday, May 25, 1710_.\r\n\r\n    Nul lum numen abest, si sit Prudentia.\r\n                                  JUV., Sat. x. 365.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, May 23._\r\n\r\nThis evening, after a little ease from the raging pain caused by so\r\nsmall an organ as an aching tooth, under which I had behaved myself so\r\nill as to have broke two pipes and my spectacles, I began to reflect\r\nwith admiration on those heroic spirits, which in the conduct of their\r\nlives seem to live so much above the condition of our make, as not only\r\nunder the agonies of pain to forbear any intemperate word or gesture,\r\nbut also in their general and ordinary behaviour to resist the impulses\r\nof their very blood and constitution. This watch over a man's self, and\r\nthe command of his temper, I take to be the greatest of human\r\nperfections, and is the effect of a strong and resolute mind. It is not\r\nonly the most expedient practice for carrying on our own designs, but\r\nis also very deservedly the most amiable quality in the sight of others.\r\nIt is a winning deference to mankind, which creates an immediate\r\nimitation of itself whenever it appears, and prevails upon all (who have\r\nto do with a person endued with it) either through shame or emulation. I\r\ndo not know how to express this habit of mind, except you will let me\r\ncall it equanimity. It is a virtue, which is necessary at every hour, in\r\nevery place, and in all conversations, and is the effect of a regular\r\nand exact prudence. He that will look back upon all the acquaintances he\r\nhas had in his whole life, will find he has seen more men capable of the\r\ngreatest employments and performances, than such as could in the general\r\nbent of their carriage act otherwise than according to their own\r\ncomplexion and humour. But the indulgence of ourselves in wholly giving\r\nway to our natural propensity, is so unjust and improper a licence, that\r\nwhen people take it up, there is very little difference, with relation\r\nto their friends and families, whether they are good- or ill-natured\r\nmen: for he that errs by being wrought upon by what we call the\r\nsweetness of his temper, is as guilty as he that offends through the\r\nperverseness of it.\r\n\r\nIt is not therefore to be regarded what men are in themselves, but what\r\nthey are in their actions. Eucrates[274] is the best-natured of all men;\r\nbut that natural softness has effects quite contrary to itself, and for\r\nwant of due bounds to his benevolence, while he has a will to be a\r\nfriend to all, he has the power of being such to none. His constant\r\ninclination to please makes him never fail of doing so; though (without\r\nbeing capable of falsehood) he is a friend only to those who are\r\npresent; for the same humour which makes him the best companion,\r\nrenders him the worst correspondent. It is a melancholy thing to\r\nconsider, that the most engaging sort of men in conversation are\r\nfrequently the most tyrannical in power, and least to be depended upon\r\nin friendship. It is certain this is not to be imputed to their own\r\ndisposition; but he that is to be led by others, has only good luck if\r\nhe is not the worst, though in himself the best man living. For this\r\nreason, we are no more wholly to indulge our good than our ill\r\ndispositions. I remember a crafty old cit, one day speaking of a\r\nwell-natured young fellow who set up with a good stock in Lombard\r\nStreet, \"I will,\" says he, \"lay no more money in his hands, for he never\r\ndenied me anything.\" This was a very base, but with him a prudential\r\nreason for breaking off commerce: and this acquaintance of mine carried\r\nthis way of judging so far, that he has often told me, he never cared to\r\ndeal with a man he liked, for that our affections must never enter into\r\nour business.\r\n\r\nWhen we look round us in this populous city, and consider how credit and\r\nesteem are lodged, you find men have a great share of the former,\r\nwithout the least portion of the latter. He who knows himself for a\r\nbeast of prey, looks upon others in the same light, and we are so apt to\r\njudge of others by ourselves, that the man who has no mercy, is as\r\ncareful as possible never to want it. Hence it is, that in many\r\ninstances men gain credit by the very contrary methods by which they do\r\nesteem; for wary traders think every affection of the mind a key to\r\ntheir cash.\r\n\r\nBut what led me into this discourse was my impatience of pain; and I\r\nhave, to my great disgrace, seen an instance of the contrary carriage in\r\nso high a degree, that I am out of countenance that I ever read Seneca.\r\nWhen I look upon the conduct of others in such occurrences, as well as\r\nbehold their equanimity in the general tenor of their life, it very much\r\nabates the self-love, which is seldom well-governed by any sort of men,\r\nand least of all by us authors.\r\n\r\nThe fortitude of a man who brings his will to the obedience of his\r\nreason is conspicuous, and carries with it a dignity in the lowest state\r\nimaginable. Poor Martius,[275] who now lies languishing in the most\r\nviolent fever, discovers in the faintest moments of his distemper such a\r\ngreatness of mind, that a perfect stranger who should now behold him,\r\nwould indeed see an object of pity, but at the same time that it was\r\nlately an object of veneration. His gallant spirit resigns, but resigns\r\nwith an air that speaks a resolution which could yield to nothing but\r\nfate itself. This is conquest in the philosophic sense; but the empire\r\nover ourselves is, methinks, no less laudable in common life, where the\r\nwhole tenor of a man's carriage is in subservience to his own reason,\r\nand conformity both to the good sense and inclination of other men.\r\n\r\nAristæus[276] is, in my opinion, a perfect master of himself in all\r\ncircumstances. He has all the spirit that man can have, and yet is as\r\nregular in his behaviour as a mere machine. He is sensible of every\r\npassion, but ruffled by none. In conversation, he frequently seems to be\r\nless knowing to be more obliging, and chooses to be on a level with\r\nothers rather than oppress with the superiority of his genius. In\r\nfriendship he is kind without profession; in business, expeditious\r\nwithout ostentation. With the greatest softness and benevolence\r\nimaginable, he is impartial in spite of all importunity, even that of\r\nhis own good nature. He is ever clear in his judgment; but in\r\ncomplaisance to his company, speaks with doubt, and never shows\r\nconfidence in argument, but to support the sense of another. Were such\r\nan equality of mind the general endeavour of all men, how sweet would be\r\nthe pleasures of conversation? He that is loud would then understand,\r\nthat we ought to call a constable, and know, that spoiling good company\r\nis the most heinous way of breaking the peace. We should then be\r\nrelieved from these zealots in society, who take upon them to be angry\r\nfor all the company, and quarrel with the waiters to show they have no\r\nrespect for anybody else in the room. To be in a rage before you, is in\r\na kind being angry with you. You may as well stand naked before company,\r\nas to use such familiarities; and to be careless of what you say, is the\r\nmost clownish way of being undressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sheer Lane, May 24._\r\n\r\nWhen I came home this evening, I found the following letters; and\r\nbecause I think one a very good answer to the other, as well as that it\r\nis the affair of a young lady, it must be immediately dismissed:\r\n\r\n     \"SIR,\r\n\r\n     \"I have a good fortune, partly paternal and partly acquired. My\r\n     younger years I spent in business; but age coming on, and having no\r\n     more children than one daughter, I resolved to be a slave no\r\n     longer: and accordingly I have disposed of my effects, placed my\r\n     money in the funds, bought a pretty seat in a pleasant country; am\r\n     making a garden, and have set up a pack of little beagles. I live\r\n     in the midst of a good many well-bred neighbours, and several\r\n     well-tempered clergymen. Against a rainy day I have a little\r\n     library; and against the gout in my stomach a little good claret.\r\n     With all this I am the miserablest man in the world; not that I've\r\n     lost the relish of any of these pleasures, but am distracted with\r\n     such a multiplicity of entertaining objects, that I am lost in the\r\n     variety.

Greenwich is the place where, it seems, he has erected his\r\nhouse; and his time of action is to be so contrived, that it is to fall\r\nin with going and returning with the tide: besides, that the bearer of\r\nthis ticket may carry down with him a particular set of company to the\r\nplay, striking off for each person so introduced one of his twenty-one\r\ntimes of admittance. In this warrant of his, he has made me a high\r\ncompliment in a facetious distich, by way of dedication of his\r\nendeavours, and desires I would recommend them to the world. I must\r\nneeds say, I have not for some time seen a properer choice than he has\r\nmade of a patron: who more fit to publish his work than a novelist[278]?\r\nwho to recommend it than a censor? This honour done me, has made me turn\r\nmy thoughts upon the nature of dedications in general, and the abuse of\r\nthat custom, as well by a long practice of my predecessors, as the\r\ncontinued folly of my contemporary authors.\r\n\r\nIn ancient times, it was the custom to address their works to some\r\neminent for their merit to mankind, or particular patronage of the\r\nwriters themselves, or knowledge in the matter of which they treated.\r\nUnder these regards, it was a memorable honour to both parties, and a\r\nvery agreeable record of their commerce with each other. These\r\napplications were never stuffed with impertinent praises, but were the\r\nnative product of their esteem, which was implicitly received, or\r\ngenerally known to be due to the patron of the work: but vain flourishes\r\ncame into the world, with other barbarous embellishments; and the\r\nenumeration of titles, and great actions, in the patrons themselves, or\r\ntheir sires, are as foreign to the matter in hand as the ornaments are\r\nin a Gothic building. This is clapping together persons which have no\r\nmanner of alliance, and can for that reason have no other effect than\r\nmaking both parties justly ridiculous. What pretence is there in Nature\r\nfor me to write to a great man, and tell him, \"My lord, because your\r\nGrace is a duke, your Grace's father before you was an earl, his\r\nlordship's father was a baron, and his lordship's father both a wise and\r\na rich man, I, Isaac Bickerstaff, am obliged, and could not possibly\r\nforbear addressing to you the following treatise.\" Though this is the\r\nplain exposition of all I could possibly say to him with a good\r\nconscience, yet the silly custom has so universally prevailed, that my\r\nlord duke and I must necessarily be particular friends from this time\r\nforward, or else I have just room for being disobliged, and may turn my\r\npanegyric into a libel. But to carry this affair still more home, were\r\nit granted that praises in dedications were proper topics, what is it\r\nthat gives a man authority to commend, or what makes it a favour to me\r\nthat he does commend me? It is certain, that there is no praise valuable\r\nbut from the praiseworthy. Were it otherwise, blame might be as much in\r\nthe same hands. Were the good and evil of fame laid upon a level among\r\nmankind, the judge on the bench, and the criminal at the bar, would\r\ndiffer only in their stations; and if one's word is to pass as much as\r\nthe other's, their reputation would be much alike to the jury.\r\nPliny,[279] speaking of the death of Martial, expresses himself with\r\ngreat gratitude to him for the honours done him in the writings of that\r\nauthor; but he begins it with an account of his character, which only\r\nmade the applause valuable. He indeed in the same Epistle says, it is a\r\nsign we have left off doing things which deserve praise, when we think\r\ncommendation impertinent. This is asserted with a just regard to the\r\npersons whose good opinion we wish for; otherwise reputation would be\r\nvalued according to the number of voices a man has for it, which are not\r\nalways to be insured on the more virtuous side. But however we pretend\r\nto model these nice affairs, true glory will never attend anything but\r\ntruth; and there is something so peculiar in it, that the very self-same\r\naction done by different men cannot merit the same degree of applause.\r\nThe Roman, who was surprised in the enemy's camp before he had\r\naccomplished his design, and thrust his bare arm into a flaming pile,\r\ntelling the general, there were many as determined as himself who\r\n(against sense of danger) had conspired his death, wrought in the very\r\nenemy an admiration of his fortitude, and a dismission with\r\napplause.[280] But the condemned slave who represented him in the\r\ntheatre, and consumed his arm in the same manner, with the same\r\nresolution, did not raise in the spectators a great idea of his virtue,\r\nbut of him whom he imitated in an action no way differing from that of\r\nthe real Scævola, but in the motive to it.\r\n\r\nThus true glory is inseparable from true merit, and whatever you call\r\nmen, they are no more than what they are in themselves; but a romantic\r\nsense has crept into the minds of the generality, who will ever mistake\r\nwords and appearances for persons and things.\r\n\r\nThe simplicity of the ancients was as conspicuous in the address of\r\ntheir writings, as in any other monuments they have left behind them.\r\nCæsar and Augustus were much more high words of respect, when added to\r\noccasions fit for their characters to appear in, than any appellations\r\nwhich have ever been since thought of. The latter of these great men had\r\na very pleasant way of dealing with applications of this kind. When he\r\nreceived pieces of poetry which he thought had worth in them, he\r\nrewarded the writer; but where he thought them empty, he generally\r\nreturned the compliment made him with some verses of his own.\r\n\r\nThis latter method I have at present occasion to imitate. A female\r\nauthor has dedicated a piece to me,[281] wherein she would make my name\r\n(as she has others) the introduction of whatever is to follow in her\r\nbook; and has spoke some panegyrical things which I know not how to\r\nreturn, for want of better acquaintance with the lady, and consequently\r\nbeing out of a capacity of giving her praise or blame. All therefore\r\nthat is left for me, according to the foregoing rules, is to lay the\r\npicture of a good and evil woman before her eyes, which are but mere\r\nwords if they do not concern her. Now you are to observe, the way in a\r\ndedication is to make all the rest of the world as little like the\r\nperson we address to as possible, according to the following epistle:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"MADAM,\r\n       \"But, M----\r\n                  \"----_Memorabile nullum\r\n                  Foeminea in poena est._----\"[282]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 277: See No. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 278: Writer of news.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 279: \"Epist.\" iii. 21.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 280: Livy, ii. 12.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 281: Mrs. Manley's \"Memoirs of Europe ... by the translator of\r\nthe 'New Atalantis.'\" See Nos. 35, 63.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 282:\r\n\r\n    \"----Nullum memorabile nomen\r\n    Foeminea in poena est.\"--\"Æneid,\" ii. 583-4.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 178.

His hall was\r\nfurnished with old lances, halberds, and morions; his food, lentils; his\r\ndress, amorous. He slept moderately, rose early, and spent his time in\r\nhunting. When by watchfulness and exercise he was thus qualified for the\r\nhardships of his intended peregrinations, he had nothing more to do but\r\nto fall hard to study; and before he should apply himself to the\r\npractical part, get into the methods of making love and war by reading\r\nbooks of knighthood. As for raising tender passion in him, Cervantes\r\nreports[283] that he was wonderfully delighted with a smooth intricate\r\nsentence; and when they listened at his study-door, they could\r\nfrequently hear him read aloud, \"The reason of the unreasonableness,\r\nwhich against my reason is wrought, doth so weaken my reason, as with\r\nall reason I do justly complain on your beauty.\" Again, he would pause\r\ntill he came to another charming sentence, and with the most pleasing\r\naccent imaginable be loud at a new paragraph: \"The high heavens, which,\r\nwith your divinity, do fortify you divinely with the stars, make you\r\ndeserveress of the deserts that your greatness deserves.\" With these,\r\nand other such passages (says my author) the poor gentleman grew\r\ndistracted, and was breaking his brains day and night to understand and\r\nunravel their sense.\r\n\r\nAs much as the case of this distempered knight is received by all the\r\nreaders of his history as the most incurable and ridiculous of all\r\nphrensies, it is very certain we have crowds among us far gone in as\r\nvisible a madness as his, though they are not observed to be in that\r\ncondition. As great and useful discoveries are sometimes made by\r\naccidental and small beginnings, I came to the knowledge of the most\r\nepidemic ill of this sort, by falling into a coffee-house where I saw my\r\nfriend the upholsterer,[284] whose crack[285] towards politics I have\r\nheretofore mentioned. This touch in the brain of the British subject is\r\nas certainly owing to the reading newspapers, as that of the Spanish\r\nworthy above mentioned to the reading works of chivalry. My\r\ncontemporaries the novelists[286] have, for the better spinning out\r\nparagraphs, and working down to the end of their columns, a most happy\r\nart in saying and unsaying, giving hints of intelligence, and\r\ninterpretations of indifferent actions, to the great disturbance of the\r\nbrains of ordinary readers. This way of going on in the words, and\r\nmaking no progress in the sense, is more particularly the excellence of\r\nmy most ingenious and renowned fellow-labourer, the _Postman_[287]; and\r\nit is to this talent in him that I impute the loss of my upholsterer's\r\nintellects. That unfortunate tradesman has for years past been the chief\r\norator in ragged assemblies, and the reader in alley coffee-houses. He\r\nwas yesterday surrounded by an audience of that sort, among whom I sat\r\nunobserved through the favour of a cloud of tobacco, and saw him with\r\nthe _Postman_ in his hand, and all the other papers safe under his left\r\nelbow. He was intermixing remarks, and reading the Paris article of May\r\n30, which says that \"it is given out that an express arrived this day,\r\nwith advice, that the armies were so near in the plain of Lens, that\r\nthey cannonaded each other.\" (\"Ay, ay, here we shall have sport.\") \"And\r\nthat it was highly probable the next express would bring us an account\r\nof an engagement.\" (\"They are welcome as soon as they please.\") \"Though\r\nsome others say, that the same will be put off till the 2nd or 3rd of\r\nJune, because the Marshal Villars expects some further reinforcements\r\nfrom Germany, and other parts, before that time.\" (\"What-a-pox does he\r\nput it off for? Does he think our horse is not marching up at the same\r\ntime? But let us see what he says further.\") \"They hope that Monsieur\r\nAlbergotti,[288] being encouraged by the presence of so great an army,\r\nwill make an extraordinary defence.\" (\"Why then I find, Albergotti is\r\none of those that love to have a great many on their side. Nay, I'll say\r\nthat for this paper, he makes the most natural inferences of any of them\r\nall.\") \"The Elector of Bavaria being uneasy to be without any command,\r\nhas desired leave to come to Court to communicate a certain project to\r\nhis Majesty. Whatever it be, it is said that prince is suddenly\r\nexpected, and then we shall have a more certain account of his project,\r\nif this report has any foundation.\" (\"Nay, this paper never imposes upon\r\nus, he goes upon sure grounds; for he won't be positive the Elector has\r\na project, or that he will come, or if he does come at all; for he\r\ndoubts, you see, whether the report has any foundation.\")\r\n\r\nWhat makes this the more lamentable is, that this way of writing falls\r\nin with the imagination of the cooler and duller part of her Majesty's\r\nsubjects. The being kept up with one line contradicting another, and the\r\nwhole, after many sentences of conjecture, vanishing in a doubt whether\r\nthere is anything at all in what the person has been reading, puts an\r\nordinary head into a vertigo, which his natural dulness would have\r\nsecured him from. Next to the labours of the _Postman_, the upholsterer\r\ntook from under his elbow honest Ichabod Dawks' _Letter_,[289] and\r\nthere, among other speculations, the historian takes upon him to say\r\nthat \"it is discoursed that there will be a battle in Flanders before\r\nthe armies separate, and many will have it to be to-morrow, the great\r\nbattle of Ramillies being fought on a Whit Sunday.\" A gentleman who was\r\na wag in this company laughed at the expression, and said, \"By Mr.\r\nDawks' favour, I warrant ye, if we meet them on Whit Sunday, or Monday,\r\nwe shall not stand upon the day[290] with them, whether it be before or\r\nafter the holidays.\" An admirer of this gentleman stood up, and told a\r\nneighbour at a distant table the conceit, at which indeed we were all\r\nvery merry. These reflections in the writers of the transactions of the\r\ntimes, seize the noddles of such as were not born to have thoughts of\r\ntheir own, and consequently lay a weight upon everything which they read\r\nin print. But Mr. Dawks concluded his paper with a courteous sentence,\r\nwhich was very well taken and applauded by the whole company. \"We wish,\"\r\nsays he, \"all our customers a merry Whitsuntide, and many of them.\"\r\nHonest Ichabod is as extraordinary a man as any of our fraternity, and\r\nas particular. His style is a dialect between the familiarity of talking\r\nand writing, and his letter such as you cannot distinguish whether print\r\nor manuscript, which gives us a refreshment[291] of the idea from what\r\nhas been told us from the press by others. This wishing a good tide had\r\nits effect upon us, and he was commended for his salutation, as showing\r\nas well the capacity of a bellman as an historian. My distempered old\r\nacquaintance read in the next place the account of the affairs abroad in\r\nthe _Courant_;[292] but the matter was told so distinctly, that these\r\nwanderers thought there was no news in it; this paper differing from the\r\nrest as a history from a romance. The tautology, the contradictions, the\r\ndoubts, and wants of confirmations, are what keep up imaginary\r\nentertainments in empty heads, and produce neglect of their own affairs,\r\npoverty, and bankruptcy, in many of the shop-statesmen; but turn the\r\nimaginations of those of a little higher orb into deliriums of\r\ndissatisfaction, which is seen in a continual fret upon all that touches\r\ntheir brains, but more particularly upon any advantage obtained by their\r\ncountry, where they are considered as lunatics, and therefore tolerated\r\nin their ravings.\r\n\r\nWhat I am now warning the people of is, that the newspapers of this\r\nisland are as pernicious to weak heads in England as ever books of\r\nchivalry to Spain; and therefore shall do all that in me lies, with the\r\nutmost care and vigilance imaginable, to prevent these growing evils. A\r\nflaming instance of this malady appeared in my old acquaintance at this\r\ntime, who, after he had done reading all his papers, ended with a\r\nthoughtful air, \"If we should have a peace, we should then know for\r\ncertain whether it was the King of Sweden that lately came to Dunkirk.\"\r\nI whispered him, and desired him to step aside a little with me. When I\r\nhad opportunity, I decoyed him into a coach, in order for his more easy\r\nconveyance to Moorfields. The man went very quietly with me; and by that\r\ntime he had brought the Swede from the defeat by the Czar to the\r\nBoristhenes, we were passing by Will's Coffeehouse, where the man of the\r\nhouse beckoned to us. We made a full stop, and could hear from above a\r\nvery loud voice swearing, with some expressions towards treason, that\r\nthe subject in France was as free as in England. His distemper would not\r\nlet him reflect, that his own discourse was an argument of the contrary.\r\nThey told him, one would speak with him below. He came immediately to\r\nour coach-side. I whispered him, that I had an order to carry him to the\r\nBastile. He immediately obeyed with great resignation: for to this sort\r\nof lunatic, whose brain is touched for the French, the name of a gaol in\r\nthat kingdom has a more agreeable sound than that of a paternal seat in\r\nthis their own country. It happened a little unluckily bringing these\r\nlunatics together, for they immediately fell into a debate concerning\r\nthe greatness of their respective monarchs; one for the King of Sweden,\r\nthe other for the Grand Monarch of France. This gentleman from Will's is\r\nnow next door to the upholsterer, safe in his apartment in my Bedlam,\r\nwith proper medicaments, and the _Mercure Galant_[293] to soothe his\r\nimagination that he is actually in France. If therefore he should escape\r\nto Covent Garden again, all persons are desired to lay hold of him, and\r\ndeliver him to Mr. Morphew, my overseer. At the same time, I desire all\r\ntrue subjects to forbear discourse with him, any otherwise than when he\r\nbegins to fight a battle for France, to say, \"Sir, I hope to see you in\r\nEngland.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 283: \"Don Quixote,\" Part I. chap. i.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 284: See Nos. 155, 160.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 285: In the _Spectator_, No. 251, Addison applies the word to\r\na crazy person: \"A crack and a projector.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 286: Writers of newspapers.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 287: The _Postman_ was edited by a French Protestant named\r\nFontive, whom Dunton describes as \"the glory and mirror of news-writers;\r\na very grave, learned, orthodox man.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 288: Albergotti was then holding Douay for Lewis XIV.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 289: See No. 18.

In the first place I\r\n     must confess to you, that I am one of the most luxurious men\r\n     living; and as I am such, I take care to make my pleasures lasting,\r\n     by following none but such as are innocent and refined, as well as,\r\n     in some measure, improving. You have in your labours been so much\r\n     concerned to represent the actions and passions of mankind, that\r\n     the whole vegetable world has almost escaped your observation: but\r\n     sure there are gratifications to be drawn from thence, which\r\n     deserve to be recommended. For your better information, I wish you\r\n     could visit your old friend in Cornwall: you would be leased to\r\n     see the many alterations I have made about my house, and how much I\r\n     have improved my estate without raising the rents of it.\r\n\r\n     \"As the winter engrosses with us near a double portion of the year\r\n     (the three delightful vicissitudes being crowded almost within the\r\n     space of six months), there is nothing upon which I have bestowed\r\n     so much study and expense, as in contriving means to soften the\r\n     severity of it, and, if possible, to establish twelve cheerful\r\n     months about my habitation. In order to this, the charges I have\r\n     been at in building and furnishing a greenhouse will, perhaps, be\r\n     thought somewhat extravagant by a great many gentlemen whose\r\n     revenues exceed mine. But when I consider, that all men of any life\r\n     and spirit have their inclinations to gratify, and when I compute\r\n     the sums laid out by the generality of the men of pleasure (in the\r\n     number of which I always rank myself) in riotous eating and\r\n     drinking, in equipage and apparel, upon wenching, gaming, racing\r\n     and hunting; I find, upon the balance, that the indulging of my\r\n     humour comes at a reasonable rate.\r\n\r\n     \"Since I communicate to you all incidents serious and trifling,\r\n     even to the death of a butterfly, that fall out within the compass\r\n     of my little empire, you will not, I hope, be ill pleased with the\r\n     draught I now send you of my little winter paradise, and with an\r\n     account of my way of amusing myself and others in it.\r\n\r\n     \"The younger Pliny, you know, writes a long letter to his friend\r\n     Gallus,[295] in which he gives him a very particular plan of the\r\n     situation, the conveniences, and the agreeableness of his villa. In\r\n     my last, you may remember, I promised you something of this kind.\r\n     Had Pliny lived in a northern climate, I doubt not but we should\r\n     have found a very complete orangery amongst his Epistles; and I,\r\n     probably, should have copied his model, instead of building after\r\n     my own fancy, and you had been referred to him for the history of\r\n     my late exploits in architecture: by which means my performances\r\n     would have made a better figure, at least in writing, than they are\r\n     like to make at present.\r\n\r\n     \"The area of my greenhouse is a hundred paces long, fifty broad,\r\n     and the roof thirty feet high. The wall toward the north is of\r\n     solid stone. On the south side, and at both the ends, the stonework\r\n     rises but three feet from the ground, excepting the pilasters,\r\n     placed at convenient distances to strengthen and beautify the\r\n     building. The intermediate spaces are filled up with large sashes\r\n     of the strongest and most transparent glass. The middle sash (which\r\n     is wider than any of the others) serves for the entrance, to which\r\n     you mount by six easy steps, and descend on the inside by as many.\r\n     This opens and shuts with greater ease, keeps the wind out better,\r\n     and is at the same time more uniform than folding-doors.\r\n\r\n     \"In the middle of the roof there runs a ceiling thirty feet broad\r\n     from one end to the other. This is enlivened by a masterly pencil,\r\n     with all the variety of rural scenes and prospects, which he has\r\n     peopled with the whole tribe of sylvan deities. Their characters\r\n     and their stories are so well expressed, that the whole seems a\r\n     collection of all the most beautiful fables of the ancient poets\r\n     translated into colours. The remaining spaces of the roof, ten feet\r\n     on each side of the ceiling, are of the clearest glass, to let in\r\n     the sky and clouds from above. The building points full east and\r\n     west, so that I enjoy the sun while he is above the horizon. His\r\n     rays are improved through the glass, and I receive through it what\r\n     is desirable in a winter-sky, without the coarse alloy of the\r\n     season, which is a kind of sifting or straining the weather. My\r\n     greens and lowers are as sensible as I am of this benefit: they\r\n     flourish and look cheerful as in the spring, while their fellow\r\n     creatures abroad are starved to death. I must add, that a moderate\r\n     expense of fire, over and above the contributions I receive from\r\n     the sun, serves to keep this large room in a due temperature; it\r\n     being sheltered from the cold winds by a hill on the north, and a\r\n     wood on the east.\r\n\r\n     \"The shell, you see, is both agreeable and convenient; and now you\r\n     shall judge, whether I have laid out the floor to advantage. There\r\n     goes through the whole length of it a spacious walk of the finest\r\n     gravel, made to bind and unite so firmly, that it seems one\r\n     continued stone; with this advantage, that it is easier to the\r\n     foot, and better for walking, than if it were what it seems to be.\r\n     At each end of the walk, on the one and on the other side of it,\r\n     lies a square plot of grass of the finest turf and brightest\r\n     verdure. What ground remains on both sides, between these little\r\n     smooth fields of green, is flagged with large quarries of white\r\n     marble, where the blue veins trace out such a variety of irregular\r\n     windings through the clear surface, that these bright plains seem\r\n     full of rivulets and streaming meanders. This to my eye, that\r\n     delights in simplicity, is inexpressibly more beautiful than the\r\n     chequered floors which are so generally admired by others. Upon the\r\n     right and upon the left, along the gravel walk, I have ranged\r\n     interchangeably the bay, the myrtle, the orange and the lemon\r\n     trees, intermixed with painted hollies, silver firs, and pyramids\r\n     of yew; all so disposed, that every tree receives an additional\r\n     beauty from its situation; besides the harmony that rises from the\r\n     disposition of the whole, no shade cuts too strongly, or breaks in\r\n     harshly upon the other; but the eye is cheered with a mild rather\r\n     than gorgeous diversity of greens.\r\n\r\n     \"The borders of the four grass plots are garnished with pots of\r\n     flowers: those delicacies of Nature create two senses at once, and\r\n     leave such delightful and gentle impressions upon the brain, that I\r\n     cannot help thinking them of equal force with the softest airs of\r\n     music, toward the smoothing of our tempers. In the centre of every\r\n     plot is a statue. The figures I have made choice of are a Venus, an\r\n     Adonis, a Diana, and an Apollo; such excellent copies, as to raise\r\n     the same delight as we should draw from the sight of the ancient\r\n     originals.\r\n\r\n     \"The north wall would have been but a tiresome waste to the eye, if\r\n     I had not diversified it with the most lively ornaments, suitable\r\n     to the place. To this intent, I have been at the expense to lead\r\n     over arches from a neighbouring hill a plentiful store of spring\r\n     water, which a beautiful Naiad, placed as high as is possible in\r\n     the centre of the wall, pours out from an urn. This, by a fall of\r\n     above twenty foot, makes a most delightful cascade into a basin,\r\n     that opens wide within the marble floor on that side. At a\r\n     reasonable distance, on either hand of the cascade, the wall is\r\n     hollowed into two spreading scallops, each of which receives a\r\n     couch of green velvet, and forms at the same time a canopy over\r\n     them. Next to them come two large aviaries, which are likewise let\r\n     into the stone. These are succeeded by two grottoes, set off with\r\n     all the pleasing rudeness of shells and moss, and cragged stones,\r\n     imitating in miniature rocks and precipices, the most dreadful and\r\n     gigantic works of Nature. After the grottoes, you have two niches,\r\n     the one inhabited by Ceres, with her sickle and sheaf of wheat; and\r\n     the other by Pomona, who, with a countenance full of good cheer,\r\n     pours a bounteous autumn of fruits out of her horn. Last of all\r\n     come two colonies of bees, whose stations lying east and west, the\r\n     one is saluted by the rising, the other by the setting sun. These,\r\n     all of them being placed at proportioned intervals, furnish out the\r\n     whole length of the wall; and the spaces that lie between are\r\n     painted in fresco, by the same hand that has enriched my ceiling.\r\n\r\n     \"Now, sir, you see my whole contrivance to elude the rigour of the\r\n     year, to bring a northern climate nearer the sun, and to exempt\r\n     myself from the common fate of my countrymen. I must detain you a\r\n     little longer, to tell you, that I never enter this delicious\r\n     retirement, but my spirits are revived, and a sweet complacency\r\n     diffuses itself over my whole mind. And how can it be otherwise,\r\n     with a conscience void of offence, where the music of falling\r\n     waters, the symphony of birds, the gentle humming of bees, the\r\n     breath of flowers, the fine imagery of painting and sculpture: in a\r\n     word, the beauties and the charms of nature and of art court all my\r\n     faculties, refresh the fibres of the brain and smooth every avenue\r\n     of thought. What pleasing meditations, what agreeable wanderings of\r\n     the mind, and what delicious slumbers, have I enjoyed here! And\r\n     when I turn up some masterly writer to my imagination, methinks\r\n     here his beauties appear in the most advantageous light, and the\r\n     rays of his genius shoot upon me with greater force and brightness\r\n     than ordinary. This place likewise keeps the whole family in good\r\n     humour, in a season wherein gloominess of temper prevails\r\n     universally in this island. My wife does often touch her lute in\r\n     one of the grottoes, and my daughter sings to it, while the ladies\r\n     with you, amidst all the diversions of the town, and in the most\r\n     affluent fortunes, are fretting and repining beneath a lowering sky\r\n     for they know not what. In this greenhouse we often dine, we drink\r\n     tea, we dance country dances; and what is the chief pleasure of\r\n     all, we entertain our neighbours in it, and by this means\r\n     contribute very much to mend the climate five or six miles about\r\n     us.

This\r\ncorrespondent takes upon him also to say, the upholsterer was not undone\r\nby turning politician, but became bankrupt by trusting his goods to\r\npersons of quality; and demands of me, that I should do justice upon\r\nsuch as brought poverty and distress upon the world below them, while\r\nthey themselves were sunk in pleasures and luxury, supported at the\r\nexpense of those very persons whom they treated with a negligence, as\r\nif they did not know whether they dealt with them or not. This is a\r\nvery heavy accusation, both of me and such as the man aggrieved accuses\r\nme of tolerating. For this reason, I resolved to take this matter into\r\nconsideration, and upon very little meditation could call to my memory\r\nmany instances which made this complaint far from being groundless. The\r\nroot of this evil does not always proceed from injustice in the men of\r\nfigure, but often from a false grandeur which they take upon them in\r\nbeing unacquainted with their own business, not considering how mean a\r\npart they act when their names and characters are subjected to the\r\nlittle arts of their servants and dependants. The overseers of the poor\r\nare a people who have no great reputation for the discharge of their\r\ntrust, but are much less scandalous than the overseers of the rich. Ask\r\na young fellow of a great estate, who was that odd fellow spoke to him\r\nin a public place? He answers, \"One that does my business.\" It is, with\r\nmany, a natural consequence of being a man of fortune, that they are not\r\nto understand the disposal of it; and they long to come to their\r\nestates, only to put themselves under new guardianship. Nay, I have\r\nknown a young fellow who was regularly bred an attorney, and was a very\r\nexpert one till he had an estate fallen to him. The moment that\r\nhappened, he who could before prove the next land he cast his eye upon\r\nhis own, and was so sharp, that a man at first sight would give him a\r\nsmall sum for a general receipt, whether he owed him anything or not:\r\nsuch a one, I say, have I seen, upon coming to an estate, forget all his\r\ndiffidence of mankind, and become the most manageable thing breathing.\r\nHe immediately wanted a stirring man to take upon him his affairs, to\r\nreceive and pay, and do everything which he himself was now too fine a\r\ngentleman to understand. It is pleasant to consider, that he who would\r\nhave got an estate had he not come to one, will certainly starve\r\nbecause one fell to him: but such contradictions are we to ourselves,\r\nand any change of life is insupportable to some natures.\r\n\r\nIt is a mistaken sense of superiority, to believe a figure or equipage\r\ngives men precedence to their neighbours. Nothing can create respect\r\nfrom mankind, but laying obligations upon them; and it may very\r\nreasonably be concluded, that if it were put into a due balance,\r\naccording to the true state of the account, many who believe themselves\r\nin possession of a large share of dignity in the world, must give place\r\nto their inferiors. The greatest of all distinctions in civil life is\r\nthat of debtor and creditor, and there needs no great progress in logic\r\nto know which, in that case, is the advantageous side. He who can say to\r\nanother, \"Pray, master,\" or \"Pray, my lord, give me my own,\" can as\r\njustly tell him, \"It is a fantastical distinction you take upon you, to\r\npretend to pass upon the world for my master or lord, when at the same\r\ntime that I wear your livery, you owe me wages; or, while I wait at your\r\ndoor, you are ashamed to see me till you have paid my bill.\"\r\n\r\nThe good old way among the gentry of England to maintain their\r\npre-eminence over the lower rank, was by their bounty, munificence, and\r\nhospitality; and it is a very unhappy change, if at present, by\r\nthemselves or their agents, the luxury of the gentry is supported by the\r\ncredit of the trader. This is what my correspondent pretends to prove\r\nout of his own books, and those of his whole neighbourhood. He has the\r\nconfidence to say, that there is a mug-house near Long Acre, where you\r\nmay every evening hear an exact account of distresses of this kind. One\r\ncomplains, that such a lady's finery is the occasion that his own wife\r\nand daughter appear so long in the same gown: another, that all the\r\nfurniture of her visiting apartment are no more hers, than the scenery\r\nof a play are the proper goods of the actress. Nay, at the lower end of\r\nthe same table, you may hear a butcher and poulterer say, that at their\r\nproper charge all that family has been maintained since they last came\r\nto town.\r\n\r\nThe free manner in which people of fashion are discoursed on at such\r\nmeetings, is but a just reproach for their failures in this kind; but\r\nthe melancholy relations of the great necessities tradesmen are driven\r\nto, who support their credit in spite of the faithless promises which\r\nare made them, and the abatement which they suffer when paid, by the\r\nextortion of upper servants, is what would stop the most thoughtless man\r\nin the career of his pleasures, if rightly represented to him.\r\n\r\nIf this matter be not very speedily amended, I shall think fit to print\r\nexact lists of all persons who are not at their own disposal, though\r\nabove the age of twenty-one; and as the trader is made bankrupt for\r\nabsence from his abode, so shall the gentleman for being at home, if,\r\nwhen Mr. Morphew calls, he cannot give him an exact account of what\r\npasses in his own family. After this fair warning, no one ought to think\r\nhimself hardly dealt with, if I take upon me to pronounce him no longer\r\nmaster of his estate, wife, or family, than he continues to improve,\r\ncherish, and maintain them upon the basis of his own property, without\r\nincursions upon his neighbour in any of these particulars.\r\n\r\nAccording to that excellent philosopher Epictetus, we are all but acting\r\nparts in a play; and it is not a distinction in itself to be high or\r\nlow, but to become the parts we are to perform. I am by my office\r\nprompter on this occasion, and shall give those who are a little out in\r\ntheir parts such soft hints as may help them to proceed, without letting\r\nit be known to the audience they were out: but if they run quite out of\r\ncharacter, they must be called off the stage, and receive parts more\r\nsuitable to their genius. Servile complaisance shall degrade a man from\r\nhis honour and quality, and haughtiness be yet more debased. Fortune\r\nshall no longer appropriate distinctions, but Nature direct us in the\r\ndisposition both of respect and discountenance. As there are tempers\r\nmade for command, and others for obedience; so there are men born for\r\nacquiring possessions, and others incapable of being other than mere\r\nlodgers in the houses of their ancestors, and have it not in their very\r\ncomposition to be proprietors of anything. These men are moved only by\r\nthe mere effects of impulse: their goodwill and disesteem are to be\r\nregarded equally, for neither is the effect of their judgment. This\r\nloose temper is that which makes a man, what Sallust so well remarks to\r\nhappen frequently in the same person, to be covetous of what is\r\nanother's, and profuse of what is his own.[297] This sort of men is\r\nusually amiable to ordinary eyes; but in the sight of reason, nothing is\r\nlaudable but what is guided by reason. The covetous prodigal is of all\r\nothers the worst man in society: if he would but take time to look into\r\nhimself, he would find his soul all over gashed with broken vows and\r\npromises, and his retrospect on his actions would not consist of\r\nreflections upon those good resolutions after mature thought, which are\r\nthe true life of a reasonable creature, but the nauseous memory of\r\nimperfect pleasures, idle dreams, and occasional amusements. To follow\r\nsuch dissatisfying pursuits, is it possible to suffer the ignominy of\r\nbeing unjust? I remember in Tully's Epistle, in the recommendation of a\r\nman to an affair which had no manner of relation to money, it is said,\r\n\"You may trust him, for he is a frugal man.\" It is certain, he who has\r\nnot a regard to strict justice in the commerce of life, can be capable\r\nof no good action in any other kind; but he who lives below his income,\r\nlays up every moment of life armour against a base world, that will\r\ncover all his frailties while he is so fortified, and exaggerate them\r\nwhen he is naked and defenceless.\r\n\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT.\r\n\r\nA stage-coach sets out exactly at six from Nando's Coffee-house[298] to\r\nMr. Tiptoe's dancing school, and returns at eleven every evening, for\r\n16_d._\r\n\r\nN.B.

Life being too short to give instances great enough of true\r\nfriendship or goodwill, some sages have thought it pious to preserve a\r\ncertain reverence for the manes of their deceased friends, and have\r\nwithdrawn themselves from the rest of the world at certain seasons, to\r\ncommemorate in their own thoughts such of their acquaintance who have\r\ngone before them out of this life: and indeed, when we are advanced in\r\nyears, there is not a more pleasing entertainment, than to recollect in\r\na gloomy moment the many we have parted with that have been dear and\r\nagreeable to us, and to cast a melancholy thought or two after those\r\nwith whom, perhaps, we have indulged ourselves in whole nights of mirth\r\nand jollity. With such inclinations in my heart I went to my closet\r\nyesterday in the evening, and resolved to be sorrowful; upon which\r\noccasion, I could not but look with disdain upon myself, that though all\r\nthe reasons which I had to lament the loss of many of my friends are now\r\nas forcible as at the moment of their departure, yet did not my heart\r\nswell with the same sorrow which I felt at that time; but I could,\r\nwithout tears, reflect upon many pleasing adventures I have had with\r\nsome who have long been blended with common earth. Though it is by the\r\nbenefit of nature that length of time thus blots out the violence of\r\nafflictions; yet with tempers too much given to pleasure, it is almost\r\nnecessary to revive the old places of grief in our memory, and ponder\r\nstep by step on past life, to lead the mind into that sobriety of\r\nthought which poises the heart, and makes it beat with due time, without\r\nbeing quickened with desire, or retarded with despair, from its proper\r\nand equal motion. When we wind up a clock that is out of order, to make\r\nit go well for the future, we do not immediately set the hand to the\r\npresent instant, but we make it strike the round of all its hours,\r\nbefore it can recover the regularity of its time. \"Such,\" thought I,\r\n\"shall be my method this evening; and since it is that day of the year\r\nwhich I dedicate to the memory of such in another life as I much\r\ndelighted in when living, an hour or two shall be sacred to sorrow and\r\ntheir memory, while I run over all the melancholy circumstances of this\r\nkind which have occurred to me in my whole life.\"\r\n\r\nThe first sense of sorrow I ever knew was upon the death of my\r\nfather,[299] at which time I was not quite five years of age; but was\r\nrather amazed at what all the house meant, than possessed with a real\r\nunderstanding why nobody was willing to play with me. I remember I went\r\ninto the room where his body lay, and my mother sat weeping alone by it.\r\nI had my battledore in my hand, and fell a beating the coffin, and\r\ncalling \"Papa\"; for I know not how I had some slight idea that he was\r\nlocked up there. My mother catched me in her arms, and transported\r\nbeyond all patience of the silent grief she was before in, she almost\r\nsmothered me in her embrace, and told me in a flood of tears, papa could\r\nnot hear me, and would play with me no more, for they were going to put\r\nhim under ground, whence he could never come to us again. She was a very\r\nbeautiful woman, of a noble spirit, and there was a dignity in her grief\r\namidst all the wildness of her transport, which, methought, struck me\r\nwith an instinct of sorrow, which, before I was sensible of what it was\r\nto grieve, seized my very soul, and has made pity the weakness of my\r\nheart ever since. The mind in infancy is, methinks, like the body in\r\nembryo, and receives impressions so forcible, that they are as hard to\r\nbe removed by reason, as any mark with which a child is born is to be\r\ntaken away by any future application. Hence it is, that good nature in\r\nme is no merit; but having been so frequently overwhelmed with her tears\r\nbefore I knew the cause of any affliction, or could draw defences from\r\nmy own judgment, I imbibed commiseration, remorse, and an unmanly\r\ngentleness of mind, which has since ensnared me into ten thousand\r\ncalamities, and from whence I can reap no advantage, except it be, that\r\nin such a humour as I am now in, I can the better indulge myself in the\r\nsoftnesses of humanity, and enjoy that sweet anxiety which arises from\r\nthe memory of past afflictions.[300]\r\n\r\nWe that are very old, are better able to remember things which befell us\r\nin our distant youth, than the passages of later days. For this reason\r\nit is, that the companions of my strong and vigorous years present\r\nthemselves more immediately to me in this office of sorrow. Untimely or\r\nunhappy deaths are what we are most apt to lament, so little are we able\r\nto make it indifferent when a thing happens, though we know it must\r\nhappen. Thus we groan under life, and bewail those who are relieved from\r\nit. Every object that returns to our imagination raises different\r\npassions according to the circumstance of their departure. Who can have\r\nlived in an army, and in a serious hour reflect upon the many gay and\r\nagreeable men that might long have flourished in the arts of peace, and\r\nnot join with the imprecations of the fatherless and widow on the tyrant\r\nto whose ambition they fell sacrifices? But gallant men, who are cut off\r\nby the sword, move rather our veneration than our pity, and we gather\r\nrelief enough from their own contempt of death, to make it no evil,\r\nwhich was approached with so much cheerfulness, and attended with so\r\nmuch honour. But when we turn our thoughts from the great parts of life\r\non such occasions, and instead of lamenting those who stood ready to\r\ngive death to those from whom they had the fortune to receive it; I say,\r\nwhen we let our thoughts wander from such noble objects, and consider\r\nthe havoc which is made among the tender and the innocent, pity enters\r\nwith an unmixed softness, and possesses all our souls at once.\r\n\r\nHere (were there words to express such sentiments with proper\r\ntenderness) I should record the beauty, innocence, and untimely death,\r\nof the first object my eyes ever beheld with love. The beauteous virgin!\r\nHow ignorantly did she charm, how carelessly excel! O Death! thou hast\r\nright to the bold, to the ambitious, to the high, and to the haughty,\r\nbut why this cruelty to the humble, to the meek, to the undiscerning, to\r\nthe thoughtless?[301] Nor age, nor business, nor distress, can erase the\r\ndear image from my imagination. In the same week, I saw her dressed for\r\na ball, and in a shroud. How ill did the habit of Death become the\r\npretty trifler? I still behold the smiling earth--A large train of\r\ndisasters were coming on to my memory, when my servant knocked at my\r\ncloset door, and interrupted me with a letter, attended with a hamper of\r\nwine, of the same sort with that which is to be put to sale on Thursday\r\nnext at Garraway's Coffee-house.[302] Upon the receipt of it, I sent for\r\nthree of my friends. We are so intimate, that we can be company in\r\nwhatever state of mind we meet, and can entertain each other without\r\nexpecting always to rejoice. The wine we found to be generous and\r\nwarming, but with such a heat as moved us rather to be cheerful than\r\nfrolicsome. It revived the spirits without firing the blood. We\r\ncommended it till two of the clock this morning, and having to-day met a\r\nlittle before dinner, we found, that though we drank two bottles a man,\r\nwe had much more reason to recollect than forget what had passed the\r\nnight before.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 299: Steele's father, Richard Steele, was a Dublin solicitor.\r\nHis mother, whose maiden name was Elinor Sheyles, had married Thomas\r\nSymes, of Dublin, as her first husband.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 300: Thackeray has compared the treatment of Death by Swift,\r\nAddison, and Steele.

[STEELE.\r\n\r\nFrom _Tuesday, June 6_, to _Thursday, June 8, 1710_.\r\n\r\n    Spectaret populum ludis attentius ipsis.--HOR., 2 Ep. i. 197.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sheer Lane, June 7._\r\n\r\nThe town grows so very empty, that the greater number of my gay\r\ncharacters are fled out of my sight into the country. My beaus are now\r\nshepherds, and my belles wood-nymphs. They are lolling over rivulets,\r\nand covered with shades, while we who remain in town hurry through the\r\ndust about impertinences, without knowing the happiness of leisure and\r\nretirement. To add to this calamity, even the actors are going to desert\r\nus for a season, and we shall not shortly have so much as a landscape or\r\nfrost-scene to refresh ourselves within the midst of our fatigues. This\r\nmay not perhaps be so sensible a loss to any other as to me; for I\r\nconfess it is one of my greatest delights to sit unobserved and unknown\r\nin the gallery, and entertain myself either with what is personated on\r\nthe stage, or observe what appearances present themselves in the\r\naudience. If there were no other good consequences in a playhouse, than\r\nthat so many persons of different ranks and conditions are placed there\r\nin their most pleasing aspects, that prospect only would be very far\r\nfrom being below the pleasures of a wise man. There is not one person\r\nyou can see, in whom, if you look with an inclination to be pleased, you\r\nmay not behold something worthy or agreeable. Our thoughts are in our\r\nfeatures; and the visage of those in whom love, rage, anger, jealousy or\r\nenvy, have their frequent mansions, carries the traces of those passions\r\nwherever the amorous, the choleric, the jealous, or the envious, are\r\npleased to make their appearance. However, the assembly at a play is\r\nusually made up of such as have a sense of some elegance in pleasure, by\r\nwhich means the audience is generally composed of those who have gentle\r\naffections, or at least of such as at that time are in the best humour\r\nyou can ever find them. This has insensibly a good effect upon our\r\nspirits; and the musical airs which are played to us, put the whole\r\ncompany into a participation of the same pleasure, and by consequence\r\nfor that time equal in humour, in fortune, and in quality. Thus far we\r\ngain only by coming into an audience; but if we find added to this, the\r\nbeauties of proper action, the force of eloquence, and the gaiety of\r\nwell-placed lights and scenes, it is being happy, and seeing others\r\nhappy for two hours; a duration of bliss not at all to be slighted by so\r\nshort-lived a creature as man. Why then should not the duty of the\r\nplayer be had in much more esteem than it is at present? If the merit of\r\na performance be to be valued according to the talents which are\r\nnecessary to it, the qualifications of a player should raise him much\r\nabove the arts and ways of life which we call mercenary or mechanic.\r\nWhen we look round a full house, and behold so few that can (though they\r\nset themselves out to show as much as the persons on the stage do) come\r\nup to what they would appear even in dumb show, how much does the actor\r\ndeserve our approbation, who adds to the advantage of looks and motions\r\nthe tone of voice, the dignity, the humility, the sorrow, the triumph\r\nsuitable to the character he personates?\r\n\r\nIt may possibly be imagined by severe men, that I am too frequent in the\r\nmention of the theatrical representations; but who is not excessive in\r\nthe discourse of what he extremely likes? Eugenio can lead you to a\r\ngallery of fine pictures, which collection he is always increasing:\r\nCrassus through woods and forests, to which he designs to add the\r\nneighbouring counties. These are great and noble instances of their\r\nmagnificence. The players are my pictures, and their scenes my\r\nterritories. By communicating the pleasure I take in them, it may in\r\nsome measure add to men's gratifications this way, as viewing the choice\r\nand wealth of Eugenio and Crassus augments the enjoyments of those whom\r\nthey entertain, with a prospect of such possessions as would not\r\notherwise fall within the reach of their fortunes.\r\n\r\nIt is a very good office one man does another, when he tells him the\r\nmanner of his being pleased; and I have often thought, that a comment\r\nupon the capacities of the players would very much improve the delight\r\nthat way, and impart it to those who otherwise have no sense of it.\r\n\r\nThe first of the present stage are Wilks,[303] and Cibber,[304] perfect\r\nactors in their different kinds. Wilks has a singular talent in\r\nrepresenting the graces of Nature, Cibber the deformity in the\r\naffectation of them. Were I a writer of plays, I should never employ\r\neither of them in parts which had not their bent this way. This is seen\r\nin the inimitable strain and run of good humour which is kept up in the\r\ncharacter of Wildair,[305] and in the nice and delicate abuse of\r\nunderstanding in that of Sir Novelty.[306] Cibber, in another light,\r\nhits exquisitely the flat civility of an affected gentleman-usher, and\r\nWilks the easy frankness of a gentleman.\r\n\r\nIf you would observe the force of the same capacities in higher life,\r\ncan anything be more ingenuous than the behaviour of Prince Harry when\r\nhis father checks him? Anything more exasperating, than that of Richard,\r\nwhen he insults his superiors? To beseech gracefully, to approach\r\nrespectfully, to pity, to mourn, to love, are the places wherein Wilks\r\nmay be made to shine with the utmost beauty: to rally pleasantly, to\r\nscorn artfully, to flatter, to ridicule, and to neglect, are what Cibber\r\nwould perform with no less excellence.\r\n\r\nWhen actors are considered with a view to their talents, it is not only\r\nthe pleasure of that hour of action which the spectators gain from their\r\nperformance, but the opposition of right and wrong on the stage would\r\nhave its force in the assistance of our judgments on other occasions. I\r\nhave at present under my tutelage a young poet, who, I design, shall\r\nentertain the town the ensuing winter. And as he does me the honour to\r\nlet me see his comedy as he writes it, I shall endeavour to make the\r\nparts fit the genius of the several actors, as exactly as their habits\r\ncan their bodies: and because the two I have mentioned are to perform\r\nthe principal parts, I have prevailed with the house to let \"The\r\nCareless Husband\"[307] be acted on Tuesday next, that my young author\r\nmay have a view of a play which is acted to perfection, both by them and\r\nall concerned in it, as being born within the walls of the theatre, and\r\nwritten with an exact knowledge of the abilities of the performers. Mr.\r\nWilks will do his best in this play, because it is for his own benefit;\r\nand Mr. Cibber, because he writ it. Besides which, all the great\r\nbeauties we have left in town, or within call of it, will be present,\r\nbecause it is the last play this season. This opportunity will, I hope,\r\ninflame my pupil with such generous notions from seeing this fair\r\nassembly as will be then present, that his play may be composed of\r\nsentiments and characters proper to be presented to such an audience.\r\nHis drama at present has only the outlines drawn. There are, I find, to\r\nbe in it all the reverent offices of life, such as regard to parents,\r\nhusbands, and honourable lovers, preserved with the utmost care; and at\r\nthe same time that agreeableness of behaviour, with the intermixture of\r\npleasing passions as arise from innocence and virtue, interspersed in\r\nsuch a manner, as that to be charming and agreeable shall appear the\r\nnatural consequence of being virtuous. This great end is one of those I\r\npropose to do in my Censorship; but if I find a thin house, on an\r\noccasion when such a work is to be promoted, my pupil shall return to\r\nhis commons at Oxford, and Sheer Lane and the theatres be no longer\r\ncorrespondents.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 303: See No. 14.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 304: Colley Cibber, actor and dramatist, was born in 1671. He\r\nwas admirable alike as an actor of comic parts and a critic of acting,\r\nand some of his comedies are excellent. In 1714 Cibber became associated\r\nwith Steele in the management of Drury Lane Theatre. After his\r\nretirement from the stage in 1733 he published his famous \"Apology\"\r\n(1740). He died in 1757.

In the Grecian and Roman nations, they were wise enough to keep\r\nup this great incentive, and it was impossible to be in the fashion\r\nwithout being a patriot. All gallantry had its first source from hence;\r\nand to want a warmth for the public welfare was a defect so scandalous,\r\nthat he who was guilty of it had no pretence to honour or manhood. What\r\nmakes the depravity among us in this behalf the more vexatious and\r\nirksome to reflect upon, is, that the contempt of life is carried as far\r\namongst us as it could be in those memorable people; and we want only a\r\nproper application of the qualities which are frequent among us to be as\r\nworthy as they. There is hardly a man to be found who will not fight\r\nupon any occasion which he thinks may taint his own honour. Were this\r\nmotive as strong in everything that regards the public, as it is in this\r\nour private case, no man would pass his life away without having\r\ndistinguished himself by some gallant instance of his zeal towards it in\r\nthe respective incidents of his life and profession. But it is so far\r\notherwise, that there cannot at present be a more ridiculous animal than\r\none who seems to regard the good of others. He in civil life whose\r\nthoughts turn upon schemes which may be of general benefit, without\r\nfurther reflection, is called a \"projector\"; and the man whose mind\r\nseems intent upon glorious achievements, a \"knight-errant.\" The ridicule\r\namong us runs strong against laudable actions. Nay, in the ordinary\r\ncourse of things, and the common regards of life, negligence of the\r\npublic is an epidemic vice. The brewer in his excise, the merchant in\r\nhis customs, and for aught we know the soldier in his muster-rolls,\r\nthink never the worse of themselves for being guilty of their respective\r\nfrauds towards the public. This evil is come to such a fantastical\r\nheight, that he is a man of a public spirit, and heroically affected to\r\nhis country, who can go so far as even to turn usurer with all he has in\r\nher funds. There is not a citizen in whose imagination such a one does\r\nnot appear in the same light of glory as Codrus, Scævola, or any other\r\ngreat name in old Rome. Were it not for the heroes of so much per cent.\r\nas have regard enough for themselves and their nation to trade with her\r\nwith their wealth, the very notion of public love would long ere now\r\nhave vanished from among us. But however general custom may hurry us\r\naway in the stream of a common error, there is no evil, no crime, so\r\ngreat as that of being cold in matters which relate to the common good.\r\nThis is in nothing more conspicuous than in a certain willingness to\r\nreceive anything that tends to the diminution of such as have been\r\nconspicuous instruments in our service. Such inclinations proceed from\r\nthe most low and vile corruption of which the soul of man is capable.\r\nThis effaces not only the practice, but the very approbation of honour\r\nand virtue; and has had such an effect that, to speak freely, the very\r\nsense of public good has no longer a part even in our conversations.\r\nCan then the most generous motive of life, the good of others, be so\r\neasily banished from the breast of man? Is it possible to draw all our\r\npassions inward? Shall the boiling heat of youth be sunk in pleasures,\r\nthe ambition of manhood in selfish intrigues? Shall all that is\r\nglorious, all that is worth the pursuit of great minds, be so easily\r\nrooted out? When the universal bent of a people seems diverted from the\r\nsense of their common good and common glory, it looks like a fatality,\r\nand crisis of impending misfortune.\r\n\r\nThe generous nations we just now mentioned understood this so very well,\r\nthat there was hardly an oration ever made which did not turn upon this\r\ngeneral sense, that the love of their country was the first and most\r\nessential quality in an honest mind. Demosthenes, in a cause wherein his\r\nfame, reputation, and fortune were embarked, puts his all upon this\r\nissue: \"Let the Athenians,\" says he, \"be benevolent to me, as they think\r\nI have been zealous for them.\" This great and discerning orator knew\r\nthere was nothing else in nature could bear him up against his\r\nadversaries, but this one quality of having shown himself willing or\r\nable to serve his country. This certainly is the test of merit; and the\r\nfirst foundation for deserving goodwill, is having it yourself. The\r\nadversary of this orator at that time was Æschines, a man of wily arts\r\nand skill in the world, who could, as occasion served, fall in with a\r\nnational start of passion, or sullenness of humour (which a whole nation\r\nis sometimes taken with as well as a private man), and by that means\r\ndivert them from their common sense, into an aversion for receiving\r\nanything in its true light. But when Demosthenes had awaked his audience\r\nwith that one hint of judging by the general tenor of his life towards\r\nthem, his services bore down his opponent before him, who fled to the\r\ncovert of his mean arts till some more favourable occasion should offer,\r\nagainst the superior merit of Demosthenes.\r\n\r\nIt were to be wished, that love of their country were the first\r\nprinciple of action in men of business, even for their own sakes; for\r\nwhen the world begins to examine into their conduct, the generality, who\r\nhave no share in, or hopes of any part in power or riches, but what is\r\nthe effect of their own labour or property, will judge of them by no\r\nother method, than that of how profitable their administration has been\r\nto the whole. They who are out of the influence of men's fortune or\r\nfavour, will let them stand or fall by this one only rule; and men who\r\ncan bear being tried by it, are always popular in their fall: those who\r\ncannot suffer such a scrutiny, are contemptible in their advancement.\r\n\r\nBut I am here running into shreds of maxims from reading Tacitus this\r\nmorning, which has driven me from my recommendation of public spirit,\r\nwhich was the intended purpose of this Lucubration. There is not a more\r\nglorious instance of it, than in the character of Regulus. This same\r\nRegulus was taken prisoner by the Carthagenians, and was sent by them to\r\nRome, in order to demand some Punic noblemen who were prisoners in\r\nexchange for himself, and was bound by an oath that he would return to\r\nCarthage if he failed in his commission. He proposes this to the Senate,\r\nwho were in suspense upon it; which Regulus observing (without having\r\nthe least notion of putting the care of his own life in competition with\r\nthe public good), desired them to consider that he was old, and almost\r\nuseless; that those demanded in exchange were men of daring tempers, and\r\ngreat merit in military affairs, and wondered they would make any doubt\r\nof permitting him to go back to the short tortures prepared for him at\r\nCarthage, where he should have the advantage of ending a long life both\r\ngloriously and usefully. This generous advice was consented to, and he\r\ntook his leave of his country and his weeping friends to go to certain\r\ndeath, with that cheerful composure, as a man, after the fatigue of\r\nbusiness in a Court or a city, retires to the next village for the air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 184.                                                     [STEELE.\r\n\r\nFrom _Saturday, June 10_, to _Tuesday, June 13, 1710_.\r\n\r\n    Una de multis face nuptiali\r\n    Digna.--HOR., 3 Od. xi. 33.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, June 12._\r\n\r\nThere are certain occasions of life which give propitious omens of the\r\nfuture good conduct of it, as well as others which explain our present\r\ninward state, according to our behaviour in them. Of the latter sort are\r\nfunerals; of the former, weddings. The manner of our carriage when we\r\nlose a friend, shows very much our temper, in the humility of our words\r\nand actions, and a general sense of our destitute condition, which runs\r\nthrough all our deportment. This gives a solemn testimony of the\r\ngenerous affection we bore our friends, when we seem to disrelish\r\neverything now we can no more enjoy them, or see them partake in our\r\nenjoyments. It is very proper and human to put ourselves as it were in\r\ntheir livery after their decease, and wear a habit unsuitable to\r\nprosperity, while those we loved and honoured are mouldering in the\r\ngrave. As this is laudable on the sorrowful side; so on the other,\r\nincidents of success may no less justly be represented and acknowledged\r\nin our outward figure and carriage. Of all such occasions, that great\r\nchange of a single life into marriage is the most important, as it is\r\nthe source of all relations, and from whence all other friendship and\r\ncommerce do principally arise. The general intent of both sexes is to\r\ndispose of themselves happily and honourably in this state; and as all\r\nthe good qualities we have are exerted to make our way into it, so the\r\nbest appearance, with regard to their minds, their persons, and their\r\nfortunes, at the first entrance into it, is a due to each other in the\r\nmarried pair, as well as a compliment to the rest of the world. It was\r\nan instruction of a wise lawgiver, that unmarried women should wear such\r\nloose habits which, in the flowing of their garb, should incite their\r\nbeholders to a desire of their persons; and that the ordinary motion of\r\ntheir bodies might display the figure and shape of their limbs in such a\r\nmanner, as at once to preserve the strictest decency, and raise the\r\nwarmest inclinations.\r\n\r\nThis was the economy of the legislator for the increase of people, and\r\nat the same time for the preservation of the genial bed. She who was the\r\nadmiration of all who beheld her while unmarried, was to bid adieu to\r\nthe pleasure of shining in the eyes of many, as soon as she took upon\r\nher the wedded condition. However, there was a festival of life allowed\r\nthe new-married, a sort of intermediate state between celibacy and\r\nmatrimony, which continued certain days. During that time,\r\nentertainments, equipages, and other circumstances of rejoicing, were\r\nencouraged, and they were permitted to exceed the common mode of living,\r\nthat the bride and bridegroom might learn from such freedoms of\r\nconversation to run into a general conduct to each other, made out of\r\ntheir past and future state, so to temper the cares of the man and the\r\nwife with the gaieties of the lover and the mistress.\r\n\r\nIn those wise ages the dignity of life was kept up, and on the\r\ncelebration of such solemnities there were no impertinent whispers and\r\nsenseless interpretations put upon the unaffected cheerfulness or\r\naccidental seriousness of the bride; but men turned their thoughts upon\r\nthe general reflections, upon what issue might probably be expected from\r\nsuch a couple in the succeeding course of their life, and felicitated\r\nthem accordingly upon such prospects.\r\n\r\nI must confess, I cannot from any ancient manuscripts, sculptures, or\r\nmedals, deduce the rise of our celebrated custom of throwing the\r\nstocking; but have a faint memory of an account a friend gave me of an\r\noriginal picture in the palace of Aldobrandini in Rome. This seems to\r\nshow a sense of this affair very different from what is usual among us.\r\nIt is a Grecian wedding, and the figures represented are, a person\r\noffering sacrifice, a beautiful damsel dancing, and another playing on\r\nthe harp. The bride is placed in her bed, the bridegroom sits at the\r\nfoot of it, with an aspect which intimates his thoughts were not only\r\nentertained with the joys with which he was surrounded, but also with a\r\nnoble gratitude, and divine pleasure in the offering, which was then\r\nmade to the gods to invoke their influence on his new condition. There\r\nappears in the face of the woman a mixture of fear, hope, and modesty;\r\nin the bridegroom, a well-governed rapture. As you see in great spirits\r\ngrief which discovers itself the more by forbearing tears and\r\ncomplaints, you may observe also the highest joy is too big for\r\nutterance, the tongue being of all the organs the least capable of\r\nexpressing such a circumstance. The nuptial torch, the bower, the\r\nmarriage song, are all particulars which we meet with in the allusions\r\nof the ancient writers; and in every one of them something is to be\r\nobserved which denotes their industry to aggrandise and adorn this\r\noccasion above all others.\r\n\r\nWith us all order and decency in this point is perverted by the insipid\r\nmirth of certain animals we usually call \"wags.\" These are a species of\r\nall men the most insupportable. One cannot without some reflection say,\r\nwhether their flat mirth provokes us more to pity or to scorn; but if\r\none considers with how great affectation they utter their frigid\r\nconceits, commiseration immediately changes itself into contempt.\r\n\r\nA wag is the last order even of pretenders to wit and good humour. He\r\nhas generally his mind prepared to receive some occasion of merriment,\r\nbut is of himself too empty to draw any out of his own set of thoughts,\r\nand therefore laughs at the next thing he meets, not because it is\r\nridiculous, but because he is under a necessity of laughing. A wag is\r\none that never in its life saw a beautiful object, but sees what it does\r\nsee in the most low and most inconsiderable light it can be placed.\r\nThere is a certain ability necessary to behold what is amiable and\r\nworthy of our approbation, which little minds want, and attempt to hide\r\nby a general disregard to everything they behold above what they are\r\nable to relish. Hence it is, that a wag in an assembly is ever guessing\r\nhow well such a lady slept last night, and how much such a young fellow\r\nis pleased with himself. The wag's gaiety consists in a certain\r\nprofessed ill-breeding, as if it were an excuse for committing a fault,\r\nthat a man knows he does so. Though all public places are full of\r\npersons of this order, yet, because I will not allow impertinence and\r\naffectation to get the better of native innocence and simplicity of\r\nmanners, I have, in spite of such little disturbers of public\r\nentertainments, persuaded my brother Tranquillus and his wife my sister\r\nJenny, in favour of Mr. Wilks, to be at the play to-morrow evening.\r\n\r\nThey, as they have so much good sense as to act naturally, without\r\nregard to the observation of others, will not, I hope, be discomposed if\r\nany of the fry of wags should take upon them to make themselves merry\r\nupon the occasion of their coming, as they intend, in their wedding\r\nclothes. My brother is a plain, worthy, and honest man, and as it is\r\nnatural for men of that turn to be mightily taken with sprightly and\r\nairy women, my sister has a vivacity which may perhaps give hopes to\r\nimpertinents, but will be esteemed the effect of innocence among wise\r\nmen. They design to sit with me in the box, which the house have been so\r\ncomplaisant to offer me whenever I think fit to come thither in my\r\npublic character.[308]\r\n\r\nI do not in the least doubt, but the true figure of conjugal affection\r\nwill appear in their looks and gestures. My sister does not affect to be\r\ngorgeous in her dress, and thinks the happiness of a wife is more\r\nvisible in a cheerful look than a gay apparel. It is a hard task to\r\nspeak of persons so nearly related to one with decency, but I may say,\r\nall who shall be at the play will allow him to have the mien of a worthy\r\nEnglish gentleman; her, that of a notable and deserving wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 308: See Nos. 120, 122. \"I remember Mr. Bickerstaff at the\r\nplayhouse, and with what a modest, decent gravity he behaved himself\"\r\n(_Examiner_, vol. iii.

BICKERSTAFF,\r\n\r\n     \"Since you have so often declared yourself a patron of the\r\n     distressed, I must acquaint you, that I am daughter to a country\r\n     gentleman of good sense, and may expect £3000 or £4000 for my\r\n     fortune. I love and am beloved by Philander, a young gentleman who\r\n     has an estate of £500 per annum, and is our near neighbour in the\r\n     country every summer. My father, though he has been a long time\r\n     acquainted with it, constantly refuses to comply with our mutual\r\n     inclinations: but what most of all torments me, is, that if ever I\r\n     speak in commendation of my lover, he is much louder in his praises\r\n     than myself; and professes that it is out of pure love and esteem\r\n     for Philander, as well as his daughter, that he can never consent\r\n     we should marry each other; when (as he terms it) we may both do so\r\n     much better. It must indeed be confessed, that two gentlemen of\r\n     considerable fortunes, made their addresses to me last winter, and\r\n     Philander (as I have since learned) was offered a young heiress\r\n     with £15,000, but it seems we could neither of us think, that\r\n     accepting those matches would be doing better than remaining\r\n     constant to our first passion. Your thoughts upon the whole may\r\n     perhaps have some weight with my father, who is one of your\r\n     admirers, as is\r\n\r\n                                            \"Your humble Servant,\r\n                                                             \"SYLVIA.\r\n\r\n     \"P.S. You are desired to be speedy, since my father daily presses\r\n     me to accept of what he calls an 'advantageous offer.'\"\r\n\r\nThere is no calamity in life that falls heavier upon human nature than a\r\ndisappointment in love, especially when it happens between two persons\r\nwhose hearts are mutually engaged to each other. It is this distress\r\nwhich has given occasion to some of the finest tragedies that were ever\r\nwritten, and daily fills the world with melancholy, discontent, frenzy,\r\nsickness, despair, and death. I have often admired at the barbarity of\r\nparents, who so frequently interpose their authority in this grand\r\narticle of life. I would fain ask Sylvia's father, whether he thinks he\r\ncan bestow a greater favour on his daughter, than to put her in a way to\r\nlive happily? Whether a man of Philander's character, with £500 per\r\nannum, is not more likely to contribute to that end, than many a young\r\nfellow whom he may have in his thoughts with so many thousands? Whether\r\nhe can make amends to his daughter by any increase of riches, for the\r\nloss of that happiness she proposes to herself in her Philander? Or\r\nwhether a father should compound with his daughter to be miserable,\r\nthough she were to get £20,000 by the bargain? I suppose he would have\r\nher reflect with esteem on his memory after his death: and does he think\r\nthis a proper method to make her do so, when, as often as she thinks on\r\nthe loss of her Philander, she must at the same time remember him as the\r\ncruel cause of it? Any transient ill-humour is soon forgotten; but the\r\nreflection of such a cruelty must continue to raise resentments as long\r\nas life itself; and by this one piece of barbarity, an indulgent father\r\nloses the merit of all his past kindnesses. It is not impossible but she\r\nmay deceive herself in the happiness which she proposes from Philander;\r\nbut as in such a case she can have no one to blame but herself, she will\r\nbear the disappointment with greater patience; but if she never makes\r\nthe experiment, however happy she may be with another, she will still\r\nthink she might have been happier with Philander. There is a kind of\r\nsympathy in souls that fits them for each other; and we may be assured,\r\nwhen we see two persons engaged in the warmths of a mutual affection,\r\nthat there are certain qualities in both their minds which bear a\r\nresemblance to one another. A generous and constant passion in an\r\nagreeable lover, where there is not too great a disparity in other\r\ncircumstances, is the greatest blessing that can befall the person\r\nbeloved; and if overlooked in one, may perhaps never be found in\r\nanother. I shall conclude this with a celebrated instance of a father's\r\nindulgence in this particular, which, though carried to an extravagance,\r\nhas something in it so tender and amiable, as may justly reproach the\r\nhardness of temper that is to be met with in many a British father.\r\n\r\nAntiochus, a prince of great hopes, fell passionately in love with the\r\nyoung Queen Stratonice, who was his mother-in-law, and had bore a son to\r\nthe old King Seleucus his father. The prince finding it impossible to\r\nextinguish his passion, fell sick, and refused all manner of\r\nnourishment, being determined to put an end to that life which was\r\nbecome insupportable.\r\n\r\nErasistratus the physician soon found that love was his distemper; and\r\nobserving the alteration in his pulse and countenance whenever\r\nStratonice made him a visit, was soon satisfied that he was dying for\r\nhis young mother-in-law. Knowing the old king's tenderness for his son,\r\nwhen he one morning inquired of his health, he told him, that the\r\nprince's distemper was love; but that it was incurable, because it was\r\nimpossible for him to possess the person whom he loved. The king,\r\nsurprised at this account, desired to know how his son's passion could\r\nbe incurable? \"Why, sir,\" replied Erasistratus, \"because he is in love\r\nwith the person I am married to.\"\r\n\r\nThe old king immediately conjured him by all his past favours to save\r\nthe life of his son and successor. \"Sir,\" said Erasistratus, \"would your\r\nmajesty but fancy yourself in my place, you would see the\r\nunreasonableness of what you desire!\" \"Heaven is my witness,\" said\r\nSeleucus, \"I could resign even my Stratonice to save my Antiochus.\" At\r\nthis the tears ran down his cheeks, which when the physician saw, taking\r\nhim by the hand, \"Sir,\" says he, \"if these are your real sentiments, the\r\nprince's life is out of danger; it is Stratonice for whom he dies.\"\r\nSeleucus immediately gave orders for solemnising the marriage; and the\r\nyoung queen, to show her obedience, very generously exchanged the father\r\nfor the son.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 186.

But when we begin to inculcate proper precepts to the\r\nchildren of this island, except we could take them out of their nurses'\r\narms, we see an amendment is almost impracticable; for we find the whole\r\nspecies of our youth and grown men is incorrigibly prepossessed with\r\nvanity, pride, or ambition, according to the respective pursuits to\r\nwhich they turn themselves: by which means the world is infatuated with\r\nthe love of appearances instead of things. Thus the vain man takes\r\npraise for honour, the proud man ceremony for respect, the ambitious man\r\npower for glory. These three characters are, indeed, of very near\r\nresemblance, but differently received by mankind. Vanity makes men\r\nridiculous; pride, odious; and ambition, terrible. The foundation of all\r\nwhich is, that they are grounded upon falsehood: for if men, instead of\r\nstudying to appear considerable, were in their own hearts possessors of\r\nthe requisites for esteem, the acceptance they otherwise unfortunately\r\naim at would be as inseparable from them, as approbation is from truth\r\nitself. By this means they would have some rule to walk by; and they\r\nmay ever be assured, that a good cause of action will certainly receive\r\na suitable effect. It may be a useful hint in such cases for a man to\r\nask of himself, whether he really is what he has a mind to be\r\nthought?[309] If he is, he need not give himself much further anxiety.\r\n\"What will the world say?\" is the common question in matters of\r\ndifficulty; as if the terror lay wholly in the sense which others, and\r\nnot we ourselves, shall have of our actions. From this one source arise\r\nall the impostors in every art and profession, in all places, among all\r\npersons in conversation, as well as in business. Hence it is, that a\r\nvain fellow takes twice as much pains to be ridiculous, as would make\r\nhim sincerely agreeable.\r\n\r\nCan any one be better fashioned, better bred, or has any one more good\r\nnature, than Damasippus? But the whole scope of his looks and actions\r\ntends so immediately to gain the good opinion of all he converses with,\r\nthat he loses it for that only reason. As it is the nature of vanity to\r\nimpose false shows for truths, so does it also turn real possessions\r\ninto imaginary ones. Damasippus, by assuming to himself what he has not,\r\nrobs himself of what he has.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing more necessary to establish reputation, than to suspend\r\nthe enjoyment of it. He that cannot bear the sense of merit with\r\nsilence, must of necessity destroy it: for fame being the general\r\nmistress of mankind, whoever gives it to himself, insults all to whom he\r\nrelates any circumstances to his own advantage. He is considered as an\r\nopen ravisher of that beauty, for whom all others pine in silence. But\r\nsome minds are so incapable of any temperance in this particular, that\r\non every second in their discourse you may observe an earnestness in\r\ntheir eyes, which shows they wait for your approbation, and perhaps the\r\nnext instant cast an eye on a glass to see how they like themselves.\r\nWalking the other day in a neighbouring Inn of Court, I saw a more happy\r\nand more graceful orator than I ever before had heard or read of. A\r\nyouth, of about nineteen years of age, was in an Indian nightgown and\r\nlaced cap pleading a cause before a glass: the young fellow had a very\r\ngood air, and seemed to hold his brief in his hand rather to help his\r\naction, than that he wanted notes for his further information. When I\r\nfirst began to observe him, I feared he would soon be alarmed; but he\r\nwas so zealous for his client, and so favourably received by the court,\r\nthat he went on with great fluency to inform the bench, that he humbly\r\nhoped they would not let the merit of the cause suffer by the youth and\r\ninexperience of the pleader; that in all things he submitted to their\r\ncandour; and modestly desired they would not conclude, but that strength\r\nof argument and force of reason may be consistent with grace of action\r\nand comeliness of person.\r\n\r\nTo me, who see people every day in the midst of crowds (whomsoever they\r\nseem to address to) talk only to themselves and of themselves, this\r\norator was not so extravagant a man as perhaps another would have\r\nthought him; but I took part in his success, and was very glad to find\r\nhe had in his favour judgment and costs without any manner of\r\nopposition.\r\n\r\nThe effects of pride and vanity are of consequence only to the proud and\r\nthe vain, and tend to no further ill than what is personal to\r\nthemselves, in preventing their progress in anything that is worthy and\r\nlaudable, and creating envy instead of emulation of superior virtue.\r\nThese ill qualities are to be found only in such as have so little\r\nminds, as to circumscribe their thoughts and designs within what\r\nproperly relates to the value which they think due to their dear and\r\namiable selves: but ambition, which is the third great impediment to\r\nhonour and virtue, is a fault of such as think themselves born for\r\nmoving in a higher orb, and prefer being powerful and mischievous to\r\nbeing virtuous and obscure. The parent of this mischief in life, so far\r\nas to regulate it into schemes, and make it possess a man's whole heart,\r\nwithout his believing himself a demon, was Machiavelli. He first taught,\r\nthat a man must necessarily appear weak to be honest. Hence it gains\r\nupon the imagination, that a great is not so despicable as a little\r\nvillain; and men are insensibly led to a belief, that the aggravation of\r\ncrimes is the diminution of them. Hence the impiety of thinking one\r\nthing and speaking another. In pursuance of this empty and unsatisfying\r\ndream, to betray, to undermine, to kill in themselves all natural\r\nsentiments of love to friends or country, is the willing practice of\r\nsuch as are thirsty of power, for any other reason than that of being\r\nuseful and acceptable to mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT.\r\n\r\nWhereas Mr. Bickerstaff has lately received a letter out of Ireland,\r\ndated June 9, importing that he is grown very dull, for the postage of\r\nwhich Mr. Morphew charges one shilling; and another without date of\r\nplace or time, for which he the said Morphew charges twopence: it is\r\ndesired, that for the future his courteous and uncourteous readers will\r\ngo a little further in expressing their good and ill-will, and pay for\r\nthe carriage of their letters, otherwise the intended pleasure or pain\r\nwhich is designed for Mr. Bickerstaff will be wholly disappointed.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 309: See Nos. 30, 39, 138.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 187.

The youth of this place are very much\r\n     divided in opinion, whether a very memorable quotation which the\r\n     author repeats out of Tertullian, be not rather of the style and\r\n     manner of Meursius? _In illo ipso voluptatis æstu quo genitale\r\n     virus expellitur, nonne aliquid de anima quoque, sentimus exire,\r\n     atque, adeo marcessimus et devigescimus cum lucis detrimento?_ This\r\n     piece of Latin goes no further than to tell us how our fathers got\r\n     us, so that we are still at a loss how we afterwards commence\r\n     eternal; for _creando infunditur, et infundendo creatur_, which is\r\n     mentioned soon after, may allude only to flesh and blood as well as\r\n     the former. Your readers in this city, some of whom have very much\r\n     approved the warmth with which you have attacked free-thinkers,\r\n     atheists, and other enemies to religion and virtue, are very much\r\n     disturbed that you have given them no account of this remarkable\r\n     dissertation: and I am employed by them to desire you would with\r\n     all possible expedition send me over the ceremony of the creation\r\n     of souls, as well as a list of all the mortal and immortal men\r\n     within the dominions of Great Britain. When you have done me this\r\n     favour, I must trouble you for other tokens of your kindness, and\r\n     particularly I desire you would let me have the religious\r\n     handkerchief,[312] which is of late so much worn in England, for I\r\n     have promised to make a present of it to a courtesan of a French\r\n     Minister.\r\n\r\n     \"Letters from the frontiers of France inform us, that a young\r\n     gentleman[313] who was to have been created a cardinal on the next\r\n     promotion, has put off his design of coming to Rome so soon as was\r\n     intended, having, as it is said, received letters from Great\r\n     Britain, wherein several virtuosi of that island have desired him\r\n     to suspend his resolutions towards a monastic life, till the\r\n     British grammarians shall publish their explication of the words\r\n     'indefeasible' and 'revolution.' According as these two hard terms\r\n     are made to fit the mouths of the people, this gentleman takes his\r\n     measures for his journey hither.\r\n\r\n     \"Your 'New Bedlam' has been read and considered by some of your\r\n     countrymen among us; and one gentleman, who is now here as a\r\n     traveller, says your design is impracticable, for that there can be\r\n     no place large enough to contain the number of your lunatics. He\r\n     advises you therefore to name the ambient sea for the boundary of\r\n     your hospital. If what he says be true, I do not see how you can\r\n     think of any other enclosure; for according to his discourse, the\r\n     whole people are taken with a vertigo; great and popular actions\r\n     are received with coldness and discontent; ill news hoped for with\r\n     impatience; heroes in your service are treated with calumny, while\r\n     criminals pass through your towns with acclamations.[314]\r\n\r\n     \"This Englishman went on to say, you seemed at present to flag\r\n     under a satiety of success, as if you wanted misfortune as a\r\n     necessary vicissitude. Yet, alas! though men have but a cold relish\r\n     of prosperity, quick is the anguish of the contrary fortune. He\r\n     proceeded to make comparisons of times, seasons, and great\r\n     incidents. After which he grew too learned for my understanding,\r\n     and talked of Hanno the Carthaginian, and his irreconcilable hatred\r\n     to the glorious commander Hannibal. Hannibal, said he, was able to\r\n     march to Rome itself, and brought that ambitious people, which\r\n     designed no less than the empire of the world, to sue for peace in\r\n     the most abject and servile manner; when faction at home detracted\r\n     from the glory of his actions, and after many artifices, at last\r\n     prevailed with the Senate to recall him from the midst of his\r\n     victories, and in the very instant when he was to reap the benefit\r\n     of all his toils, by reducing the then common enemy of all nations\r\n     which had liberty to reason. When Hannibal heard the message of the\r\n     Carthaginian senators who were sent to recall him, he was moved\r\n     with a generous and disdainful sorrow, and is reported to have\r\n     said, 'Hannibal then must be conquered not by the arms of the\r\n     Romans, whom he has often put to flight, but by the envy and\r\n     detraction of his countrymen. Nor shall Scipio triumph so much in\r\n     his fall as Hanno, who will smile to have purchased the ruin of\r\n     Hannibal, though attended with the fall of Carthage.'[315]\r\n\r\n                                                \"I am, Sir, &c.\r\n                                                           \"PASQUIN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Will's Coffee-house, June 19._\r\n\r\nThere is a sensible satisfaction in observing the countenance and action\r\nof the people on some occasions. To gratify myself in this pleasure, I\r\ncame hither with all speed this evening with an account of the surrender\r\nof Douay. As soon as the battle-critics[316] heard it, they immediately\r\ndrew some comfort, in that it must have cost us a great deal of men.\r\nOthers were so negligent of the glory of their country, that they went\r\non in their discourse on the full house which is to be at \"Othello\" on\r\nThursday, and the curiosity they should go with to see Wilks play a part\r\nso very different from what he had ever before appeared in, together\r\nwith the expectation that was raised in the gay part of the town on that\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nThis universal indolence and inattention among us to things that concern\r\nthe public, made me look back with the highest reverence on the glorious\r\ninstances in antiquity, of a contrary behaviour in the like\r\ncircumstances. Harry English, upon observing the room so little roused\r\non the news, fell into the same way of thinking. \"How unlike,\" said he,\r\n\"Mr. Bickerstaff, are we to the old Romans! There was not a subject of\r\ntheir State but thought himself as much concerned in the honour of his\r\ncountry, as the first officer of the commonwealth. How do I admire the\r\nmessenger, who ran with a thorn in his foot to tell the news of a\r\nvictory to the Senate! He had not leisure for his private pain, till he\r\nhad expressed his public joy; nor could he suffer as a man, till he had\r\ntriumphed as a Roman.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 310: See No. 129. In Lillie's \"Letters sent to the _Tatler_\r\nand _Spectator_\" (i. 56) there is a letter from \"Orontes\" to Mr.\r\nBickerstaff, dated July 6, 1710, referring to this and to No. 190, in\r\nwhich the writer says: \"You would do yourself a grand favour, if you\r\nwould break off acquaintance with the Italian Pasquin, and not disturb\r\nyourself with principles which are as far above your thoughts as the\r\nprobability of your discovering the philosopher's stone.\" A censor\r\nshould not be among the factions.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 311: See No. 118.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 312: Handkerchiefs printed with pictures of Dr. Sacheverell.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 313: The Pretender.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 314: Dr. Sacheverell received many popular ovations while he\r\nwas suspended from preaching: \"Lest these brethren in iniquity [the\r\n_Observator_ and the _Review_] should not prove sufficient to poison the\r\nnation, sow sedition plentifully, and ripen rebellion to a fruitful\r\nharvest of blood and rapine, a third person [the _Tatler_] who for a\r\nconsiderable time hath diverted the Town with the most useful and\r\npleasing amusements our age ever produced, hath joined in the cry with\r\nthem, in hopes, no doubt, that by his additional strength they shall\r\nbecome such a formidable Triumvirate that all opposition must fall\r\nbefore them, and the Church irresistibly submit to that fate which the\r\nother two have so long endeavoured to procure by their seditious popular\r\nharangues....

The next\r\nnumber of the _Moderator_, No. 14, is upon the same subject, and is\r\nlargely occupied with a discussion of the legal question mentioned in\r\nthe _Tatler_, No. 190. The writer speaks of the brains of the common\r\npeople, who are too apt to censure the actions of their superiors, as\r\n\"set on work by a person who has gained their esteem by his learned\r\nLucubrations.\" \"They are assured that a gentleman of his bright parts\r\nand learning must be intimately acquainted with persons of the first\r\nrank and quality, from whom he learns these high and important secrets\r\nwhich he thus generously communicates to the world.\" If any one,\r\ntherefore, pretends that the author's meaning is that the \"Duke of\r\nMarlborough is likely to be ruined by the Lord Treasurer's converting to\r\nother uses that money which our Senate voted for our General's service,\r\nwho is to be blamed for the vile aspersion?\" Ministers should take care\r\nthat the spreaders of such false reports shall know to their cost that\r\nthe Act respecting false and slanderous news is still in force.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 315: The conclusion of Pasquin's letter alludes to the\r\nfollowing allegorical piece, the publication of which was just then\r\nrecent: \"The History of Hannibal and Hanno, &c., collected from the best\r\nauthors, by A.

June 21._\r\n\r\nI was this morning looking over my letters that I have lately received\r\nfrom my several correspondents; some of which referring to my late\r\npapers, I have laid aside, with an intent to give my reader a sight of\r\nthem. The first criticises upon my greenhouse, and is as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"MR. BICKERSTAFF,                     \"South Wales, _June 7_.\r\n\r\n     \"This letter comes to you from my orangery, which I intend to\r\n     reform as much as I can, according to your ingenious model, and\r\n     shall only beg of you to communicate to me your secret of\r\n     preserving grass-plots in a covered room;[317] for in the climate\r\n     where my country-seat lies, they require rain and dews as well as\r\n     sun and fresh air, and cannot live upon such fine food as your\r\n     'sifted weather.' I must likewise desire you to write over your\r\n     greenhouse the following motto:\r\n\r\n         \"_Hic ver perpetuum, atque alienis mensibus æstas._\r\n\r\n     instead of your\r\n\r\n         \"_O! qui me gelidis sub montibus Hæmi\r\n         Sistat, et ingenti ramorum protegat umbrâ!_[318]\r\n\r\n     which, under favour, is the panting of one in summer after cool\r\n     shades, and not of one in winter after a summer-house. The rest of\r\n     your plan is very beautiful; and that your friend who has so well\r\n     described it may enjoy it many winters, is the hearty wish of\r\n\r\n                                          \"His and your Unknown,\" &c.\r\n\r\nThis oversight of a grass-plot in my friend's greenhouse, puts me in\r\nmind of a like inconsistency in a celebrated picture, where Moses is\r\nrepresented as striking a rock, and the Children of Israel quenching\r\ntheir thirst at the waters that flow from it, and run through a\r\nbeautiful landscape of groves and meadows, which could not flourish in a\r\nplace where water was to have been found only by a miracle.\r\n\r\nThe next letter comes to me from a Kentish yeoman, who is very angry\r\nwith me for my advice to parents, occasioned by the amours of Sylvia and\r\nPhilander, as related in my paper, No. 185:\r\n\r\n     \"SQUIRE BICKERSTAFF,\r\n\r\n     \"I don't know by what chance one of your _Tatlers_ is got into my\r\n     family, and has almost turned the brains of my eldest daughter\r\n     Winifred, who has been so undutiful as to fall in love of her own\r\n     head, and tells me a foolish heathen story that she has read in\r\n     your paper to persuade me to give my consent. I am too wise to let\r\n     children have their own wills in a business like marriage. It is a\r\n     matter in which neither I myself, nor any of my kindred, were ever\r\n     humoured. My wife and I never pretended to love one another like\r\n     your Sylvias and Philanders; and yet if you saw our fireside, you\r\n     would be satisfied we are not always a-squabbling. For my part, I\r\n     think that where man and woman come together by their own good\r\n     liking, there is so much fondling and fooling, that it hinders\r\n     young people from minding their business. I must therefore desire\r\n     you to change your note, and instead of advising us old folks, who\r\n     perhaps have more wit than yourself, to let Sylvia know, that she\r\n     ought to act like a dutiful daughter, and marry the man that she\r\n     does not care for. Our great-grandmothers were all bid to marry\r\n     first, and love would come afterwards; and I don't see why their\r\n     daughters should follow their own inventions. I am resolved\r\n     Winifred shan't.\r\n\r\n                                                         \"Yours,\" &c.\r\n\r\nThis letter is a natural picture of ordinary contracts, and of the\r\nsentiments of those minds that lie under a kind of intellectual\r\nrusticity. This trifling occasion made me run over in my imagination\r\nthe many scenes I have observed of the married condition, wherein the\r\nquintessence of pleasure and pain are represented as they accompany that\r\nstate, and no other. It is certain, there are a thousand thousand like\r\nthe above-mentioned yeoman and his wife, who are never highly pleased or\r\ndistasted in their whole lives: but when we consider the more informed\r\npart of mankind, and look upon their behaviour, it then appears that\r\nvery little of their time is indifferent, but generally spent in the\r\nmost anxious vexation, or the highest satisfaction. Shakespeare has\r\nadmirably represented both the aspects of this state in the most\r\nexcellent tragedy of \"Othello.\" In the character of Desdemona, he runs\r\nthrough all the sentiments of a virtuous maid and a tender wife. She is\r\ncaptivated by his virtue, and faithful to him, as well from that motive,\r\nas regard to her own honour. Othello is a great and noble spirit, misled\r\nby the villany of a false friend to suspect her innocence, and resents\r\nit accordingly. When after the many instances of passion the wife is\r\ntold her husband is jealous, her simplicity makes her incapable of\r\nbelieving it, and say, after such circumstances as would drive another\r\nwoman into distraction,\r\n\r\n    \"_I think the sun where he was born\r\n    Drew all such humours from him._\"[319]\r\n\r\nThis opinion of him is so just, that his noble and tender heart beats\r\nitself to pieces before he can affront her with the mention of his\r\njealousy; and owns, this suspicion has blotted out all the sense of\r\nglory and happiness which before it was possessed with, when he laments\r\nhimself in the warm allusions of a mind accustomed to entertainments so\r\nvery different from the pangs of jealousy and revenge. How moving is his\r\nsorrow, when he cries out as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"_I had been happy, if the general camp,\r\n    Pioneers and all, had tasted her sweet body,\r\n    So I had nothing known. Oh now! for ever\r\n    Farewell the tranquil mind! Farewell content,\r\n    Farewell the plumèd troops, and the big wars,\r\n    That make ambition virtue! Oh farewell!\r\n    Farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump,\r\n    The spirit-stirring drum, th' ear-piercing fife,\r\n    The royal banner, and all quality,\r\n    Pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious war!\r\n    And oh ye mortal engines! whose rude throats\r\n    The immortal Jove's dread clamours counterfeit,\r\n    Farewell! Othello's occupation's gone._[320]\"\r\n\r\nI believe I may venture to say, there is not in any other part of\r\nShakespeare's works more strong and lively pictures of nature than in\r\nthis. I shall therefore steal incog. to see it, out of curiosity to\r\nobserve how Wilks and Cibber touch those places where Betterton[321] and\r\nSandford[322] so very highly excelled. But now I am got into a discourse\r\nof acting, with which I am so professedly pleased, I shall conclude this\r\npaper with a note I have just received from the two ingenious friends,\r\nMr. Penkethman[323] and Mr. Bullock:[324]\r\n\r\n     \"SIR,\r\n\r\n     \"Finding by your paper, No. 182, that you are drawing parallels\r\n     between the greatest actors of the age; as you have already begun\r\n     with Mr. Wilks and Mr. Cibber, we desire you would do the same\r\n     justice to your humble Servants,\r\n\r\n                                       \"WILLIAM BULLOCK, and\r\n                                                \"WILLIAM PENKETHMAN.\"\r\n\r\nFor the information of posterity, I shall comply with this letter, and\r\nset these two great men in such a light as Sallust has placed his Cato\r\nand Cæsar.\r\n\r\nMr. William Bullock and Mr. William Penkethman are of the same age,\r\nprofession, and sex. They both distinguish themselves in a very\r\nparticular manner under the discipline of the crabtree, with this only\r\ndifference, that Mr. Bullock has the most agreeable squawl, and Mr.\r\nPenkethman the more graceful shrug. Penkethman devours a cold chicken\r\nwith great applause; Bullock's talent lies chiefly in asparagus.\r\nPenkethman is very dexterous at conveying himself under a table; Bullock\r\nis no less active at jumping over a stick.

This parcel is a collection of\r\nletters written by the children of the family to which he belongs to\r\ntheir father, and contain all the little passages of their lives, and\r\nthe new ideas they received as their years advanced. There is in them\r\nan account of their diversions as well as their exercises; and what I\r\nthought very remarkable, is, that two sons of the family, who now make\r\nconsiderable figures in the world, gave omens of that sort of character\r\nwhich they now bear, in the first rudiments of thought which they show\r\nin their letters. Were one to point out a method of education, one could\r\nnot, methinks, frame one more pleasing or improving than this; where the\r\nchildren get a habit of communicating their thoughts and inclinations to\r\ntheir best friend with so much freedom, that he can form schemes for\r\ntheir future life and conduct from an observation of their tempers, and\r\nby that means be early enough in choosing their way of life, to make\r\nthem forward in some art or science at an age when others have not\r\ndetermined what profession to follow. As to the persons concerned in\r\nthis packet I am speaking of, they have given great proofs of the force\r\nof this conduct of their father in the effect it has had upon their\r\nlives and manners. The elder, who is a scholar, showed from his infancy\r\na propensity to polite studies, and has made a suitable progress in\r\nliterature; but his learning is so well woven into his mind, that from\r\nthe impressions of it, he seems rather to have contracted a habit of\r\nlife, than manner of discourse. To his books he seems to owe a good\r\neconomy in his affairs, and a complacency in his manners, though in\r\nothers that way of education has commonly a quite different effect. The\r\nepistles of the other son are full of accounts of what he thought most\r\nremarkable in his reading. He sends his father for news the last noble\r\nstory he had read. I observe, he is particularly touched with the\r\nconduct of Codrus, who plotted his own death, because the oracle had\r\nsaid, if he were not killed, the enemy should prevail over his country.\r\nMany other incidents in his little letters give omens of a soul capable\r\nof generous undertakings; and what makes it the more particular is, that\r\nthis gentleman had, in the present war, the honour and happiness of\r\ndoing an action for which only it was worth coming into the world. Their\r\nfather is the most intimate friend they have, and they always consult\r\nhim rather than any other, when any error has happened in their conduct\r\nthrough youth and inadvertency. The behaviour of this gentleman to his\r\nsons has made his life pass away with the pleasures of a second youth;\r\nfor as the vexations which men receive from their children hasten the\r\napproach of age and double the force of years; so the comforts which\r\nthey reap from them are balm to all other sorrows, and disappoint the\r\ninjuries of time. Parents of children repeat their lives in their\r\noffspring, and their concern for them is so near, that they feel all\r\ntheir sufferings and enjoyments as much as if they regarded their own\r\nproper persons. But it is generally so far otherwise, that the common\r\nrace of squires in this kingdom use their sons as persons that are\r\nwaiting only for their funerals, and spies upon their health and\r\nhappiness; as indeed they are by their own making them such. In cases\r\nwhere a man takes the liberty after this manner to reprehend others, it\r\nis commonly said, \"Let him look at home.\" I am sorry to own it; but\r\nthere is one branch of the house of the Bickerstaffs, who have been as\r\nerroneous in their conduct this way as any other family whatsoever. The\r\nhead of this branch is now in town, and has brought up with him his son\r\nand daughter (who are all the children he has) in order to be put some\r\nway into the world, and see fashions. They are both very ill-bred cubs,\r\nand having lived together from their infancy without knowledge of the\r\ndistinctions and decencies that are proper to be paid to each other's\r\nsex, they squabble like two brothers. The father is one of those who\r\nknows no better than that all pleasure is debauchery, and imagines,\r\nwhen he sees a man become his estate, that he will certainly spend it.\r\nThis branch are a people who never had among them one man eminent either\r\nfor good or ill; however, have all along kept their heads just above\r\nwater, not by a prudent and regular economy, but by expedients in the\r\nmatches they have made into their house. When one of the family has, in\r\nthe pursuit of foxes, and in the entertainment of clowns, run out the\r\nthird part of the value of his estate, such a spendthrift has dressed up\r\nhis eldest son, and married what they call a good fortune, who has\r\nsupported the father as a tyrant over them, during his life, in the same\r\nhouse or neighbourhood. The son in succession has just taken the same\r\nmethod to keep up his dignity, till the mortgages he has ate and drank\r\nhimself into, have reduced him to the necessity of sacrificing his son\r\nalso, in imitation of his progenitor. This had been for many generations\r\nthe whole that had happened in the family of Sam. Bickerstaff, till the\r\ntime of my present cousin Samuel, the father of the young people we have\r\njust now spoken of.\r\n\r\nSamuel Bickerstaff, Esq., is so happy, as that by several legacies from\r\ndistant relations, deaths of maiden sisters, and other instances of good\r\nfortune, he has, besides his real estate, a great sum of ready money.\r\nHis son at the same time knows he has a good fortune, which the father\r\ncannot alienate, though he strives to make him believe he depends only\r\non his will for maintenance. Tom is now in his nineteenth year, Mrs.\r\nMary in her fifteenth. Cousin Samuel, who understands no one point of\r\ngood behaviour as it regards all the rest of the world, is an exact\r\ncritic in the dress, the motion, the looks and gestures of his children.\r\nWhat adds to their misery is, that he is excessively fond of them, and\r\nthe greatest part of their time is spent in the presence of this nice\r\nobserver. Their life is one continued constraint. The girl never turns\r\nher head, but she is warned not to follow the proud minxes of the town.\r\nThe boy is not to turn fop, or be quarrelsome; at the same time not to\r\ntake an affront. I had the good fortune to dine with him to-day, and\r\nheard his fatherly table-talk as we sat at dinner, which, if my memory\r\ndoes not fail me, for the benefit of the world, I shall set down as he\r\nspoke it, which was much as follows, and may be of great use to those\r\nparents who seem to make it a rule, that their children's turn to enjoy\r\nthe world is not to commence till they themselves have left it.\r\n\r\n     \"Now, Tom, I have bought you chambers in the Inns of Court. I allow\r\n     you to take a walk once or twice a day round the garden. If you\r\n     mind your business, you need not study to be as great a lawyer as\r\n     Coke upon Littleton. I have that that will keep you; but be sure\r\n     you keep an exact account of your linen. Write down what you give\r\n     out to your laundress, and what she brings home again. Go as little\r\n     as possible to the other end of the town; but if you do, come home\r\n     early. I believe I was as sharp as you for your years, and I had my\r\n     hat snatched off my head coming home late at a shop by St.\r\n     Clement's Church, and I don't know from that day to this who took\r\n     it. I do not care if you learn to fence a little, for I would not\r\n     have you be made a fool of. Let me have an account of everything\r\n     every post; I am willing to be at that charge, and I think you need\r\n     not spare your pains.

I have hinted heretofore some things\r\nwhich discover the real sorrow I am in at the observation, that it is\r\nnow very much so in Great Britain, and have had the honour to be pelted\r\nwith several epistles to expostulate with me on that subject;[327] among\r\nothers, one from a person of the number of those they call Quakers, who\r\nseems to admonish me out of pure zeal and goodwill. But as there is no\r\ncharacter so unjust as that of talking in party upon all occasions,\r\nwithout respect to merit or worth on the contrary side, so there is no\r\npart we can act so justifiable as to speak our mind when we see things\r\nurged to extremity, against all that is praiseworthy or valuable in\r\nlife, upon general and groundless suggestions. But if I have talked too\r\nfrankly upon such reflections, my correspondent has laid before me,\r\nafter his way, the error of it in a manner that makes me indeed\r\nthankful for his kindness, but the more inclinable to repeat the\r\nimprudence from the necessity of the circumstance:\r\n\r\n                                          \"The 23rd of the 6th month,\r\n                                           which is the month _June_.\r\n     \"FRIEND ISAAC,\r\n\r\n     \"Forasmuch as I love thee, I cannot any longer refrain declaring my\r\n     mind unto thee concerning some things. Thou didst thyself indite\r\n     the epistle inserted in one of thy late Lucubrations, as thou\r\n     wouldst have us call them: for verily thy friend of stone,[328] and\r\n     I speak according to knowledge, hath no fingers; and though he hath\r\n     a mouth, yet speaketh he not therewith; nor yet did that epistle at\r\n     all come unto thee from the mansion-house of the Scarlet Whore. It\r\n     is plain therefore, that the truth is not in thee: but since thou\r\n     wouldst lie, couldst thou not lie with more discretion? Wherefore\r\n     shouldst thou insult over the afflicted, or add sorrow unto the\r\n     heavy of heart? Truly this gall proceedeth not from the spirit of\r\n     meekness. I tell thee moreover, the people of this land be\r\n     marvellously given to change; insomuch that it may likely come to\r\n     pass, that before thou art many years nearer to thy dissolution,\r\n     thou mayest behold him sitting on a high place whom thou now\r\n     laughest to scorn: and then how wilt thou be glad to humble thyself\r\n     to the ground, and lick the dust of his feet, that thou mayest find\r\n     favour in his sight? If thou didst meditate as much upon the Word\r\n     as thou dost upon the profane scribblings of the wise ones of this\r\n     generation, thou wouldst have remembered what happened unto Shimei,\r\n     the son of Gera the Benjamite, who cursed the good man David in his\r\n     distress.[329] David pardoned his transgression, yet was he\r\n     afterwards taken as in a snare by the words of his own mouth, and\r\n     fell by the sword of Solomon the chief ruler.[330]Furthermore, I do\r\n     not remember to have heard in the days of my youth and vanity, when,\r\n     like thine, my conversation was with the Gentiles, that the men of\r\n     Rome, which is Babylon, ever sued unto the men of Carthage for\r\n     tranquillity, as thou dost aver: neither was Hannibal, the son of\r\n     Hamilcar, called home by his countrymen, till these saw the sword\r\n     of their enemies at their gates; and then was it not time for him,\r\n     thinkest thou, to return? It appeareth therefore that thou dost\r\n     prophecy backwards; thou dost row one way, and look another; and\r\n     indeed in all things art thou too much a time-server; yet seemest\r\n     thou not to consider what a day may bring forth. Think of this, and\r\n     take tobacco.\r\n\r\n                                                \"Thy Friend,\r\n                                                          \"AMINADAB.\"\r\n\r\nIf the zealous writer of the above letter has any meaning, it is of too\r\nhigh a nature to be the subject of my Lucubrations. I shall therefore\r\nwaive such high points, and be as useful as I can to persons of less\r\nmoment than any he hints at. When a man runs into a little fame in the\r\nworld, as he meets with a great deal of reproach which he does not\r\ndeserve, so does he also a great deal of esteem to which he has in\r\nhimself no pretensions. Were it otherwise, I am sure no one would offer\r\nto put a law case to me: but because I am an adept in physic and\r\nastrology, they will needs persuade me that I am no less a proficient in\r\nall other sciences. However, the point mentioned in the following letter\r\nis so plain a one, that I think I need not trouble myself to cast a\r\nfigure to be able to discuss it.\r\n\r\n     \"MR.

[STEELE.\r\n\r\nFrom _Tuesday, June 27_, to _Thursday, June 29, 1710_.\r\n\r\n    ----Propter vitam vivendi perdere causas.--JUV., Sat. viii. 84.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my own Apartment, June 28._\r\n\r\nOf all the evils under the sun, that of making vice commendable is the\r\ngreatest: for it seems to be the basis of society, that applause and\r\ncontempt should be always given to proper objects. But in this age we\r\nbehold things for which we ought to have an abhorrence, not only\r\nreceived without disdain, but even valued as motives of emulation. This\r\nis naturally the destruction of simplicity of manners, openness of\r\nheart, and generosity of temper. When one gives oneself the liberty to\r\nrange, and run over in one's thoughts the different geniuses of men\r\nwhich one meets in the world, one cannot but observe, that most of the\r\nindirection and artifice which is used among men, does not proceed so\r\nmuch from a degeneracy in Nature, as an affectation of appearing men of\r\nconsequence by such practices. By this means it is, that a cunning man\r\nis so far from being ashamed of being esteemed such, that he secretly\r\nrejoices in it. It has been a sort of maxim, that the greatest art is to\r\nconceal art; but I know not how, among some people we meet with, their\r\ngreatest cunning is to appear cunning. There is Polypragmon[332] makes\r\nit the whole business of his life to be thought a cunning fellow, and\r\nthinks it a much greater character to be terrible than agreeable. When\r\nit has once entered into a man's head to have an ambition to be thought\r\ncrafty, all other evils are necessary consequences. To deceive is the\r\nimmediate endeavour of him who is proud of the capacity of doing it. It\r\nis certain, Polypragmon does all the ill he possibly can, but pretends\r\nto much more than he performs. He is contented in his own thoughts, and\r\nhugs himself in his closet, that though he is locked up there and doing\r\nnothing, the world does not know but that he is doing mischief. To\r\nfavour this suspicion, he gives half-looks and shrugs in his general\r\nbehaviour, to give you to understand that you don't know what he means.\r\nHe is also wonderfully adverbial in his expressions, and breaks off with\r\na \"perhaps\" and a nod of the head, upon matters of the most indifferent\r\nnature. It is a mighty practice with men of this genius to avoid\r\nfrequent appearance in public, and to be as mysterious as possible when\r\nthey do come into company. There is nothing to be done, according to\r\nthem, the common way; and let the matter in hand be what it will, it\r\nmust be carried with an air of importance, and transacted, if we may so\r\nspeak, with an ostentatious secrecy. These are your persons of long\r\nheads, who would fain make the world believe their thoughts and ideas\r\nare very much superior to their neighbours', and do not value what these\r\ntheir neighbours think of them, provided they do not reckon them fools.\r\nThese have such a romantic touch in business, that they hate to perform\r\nanything like other men. Were it in their choice, they had rather bring\r\ntheir purposes to bear by overreaching the persons they deal with, than\r\nby a plain and simple manner. They make difficulties for the honour of\r\nsurmounting them. Polypragmon is eternally busied after this manner,\r\nwith no other prospect, than that he is in hopes to be thought the most\r\ncunning of all men, and fears the imputation of want of understanding\r\nmuch more than that of the abuse of it. But alas! how contemptible is\r\nsuch an ambition, which is the very reverse of all that is truly\r\nlaudable, and the very contradiction to the only means to a just\r\nreputation, simplicity of manners? Cunning can in no circumstance\r\nimaginable be a quality worthy a man except in his own defence, and\r\nmerely to conceal himself from such as are so; and in such cases it is\r\nno longer craft, but wisdom. The monstrous affectation of being thought\r\nartful immediately kills all thoughts of humanity and goodness, and\r\ngives men a sense of the soft affections and impulses of the mind (which\r\nare imprinted in us for our mutual advantage and succour) as of mere\r\nweaknesses and follies. According to the men of cunning, you are to put\r\noff the nature of a man as fast as you can, and acquire that of a\r\ndemon, as if it were a more eligible character to be a powerful enemy\r\nthan an able friend. But it ought to be a mortification to men affected\r\nthis way, that there wants but little more than instinct to be\r\nconsiderable in it; for when a man has arrived at being very bad in his\r\ninclination, he has not much more to do, but to conceal himself, and he\r\nmay revenge, cheat, and deceive, without much employment for\r\nunderstanding, and go on with great cheerfulness with the high applause\r\nof being a prodigious cunning fellow. But indeed, when we arrive at that\r\npitch of false taste, as not to think cunning a contemptible quality, it\r\nis, methinks, a very great injustice that pick-pockets are had in so\r\nlittle veneration, who must be admirably well turned, not only for the\r\ntheoretic, but also the practical behaviour of cunning fellows. After\r\nall the endeavour of this family of men whom we call cunning, their\r\nwhole work falls to pieces, if others will lay down all esteem for such\r\nartifices, and treat it as an unmanly quality, which they forbear to\r\npractise only because they abhor it. When the spider is ranging in the\r\ndifferent apartments of his web, it is true that he only can weave so\r\nfine a thread; but it is in the power of the merest drone that has wings\r\nto fly through and destroy it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Will's Coffee-house, June 28._\r\n\r\nThough the taste of wit and pleasure is at present but very low in this\r\ntown, yet there are some that preserve their relish undebauched with\r\ncommon impressions, and can distinguish between reality and imposture. A\r\ngentleman was saying here this evening, that he would go to the play\r\nto-morrow night to see heroism, as it has been represented by some of\r\nour tragedians, represented in burlesque. It seems, the play of\r\n\"Alexander\" is to be then turned into ridicule for its bombast, and\r\nother false ornaments in the thought as well as the language.[333] The\r\nbluster Alexander makes, is as much inconsistent with the character of a\r\nhero, as the roughness of Clytus is an instance of the sincerity of a\r\nbold artless soldier. To be plain is not to be rude, but rather inclines\r\na man to civility and deference; not indeed to show it in the gestures\r\nof the body, but in the sentiments of the mind. It is, among other\r\nthings, from the impertinent figures unskilful dramatists draw of the\r\ncharacters of men, that youth are bewildered and prejudiced in their\r\nsense of the world, of which they have no notions but what they draw\r\nfrom books and such representations. Thus talk to a very young man, let\r\nhim be of never so good sense, and he shall smile when you speak of\r\nsincerity in a courtier, good sense in a soldier, or honesty in a\r\npolitician. The reason of this is, that you hardly see one play wherein\r\neach of these ways of life is not drawn by hands that know nothing of\r\nany one of them: and the truth is so far of the opposite side to what\r\nthey paint, that it is more impracticable to live in esteem in Courts\r\nthan anywhere else without sincerity. Good sense is the great requisite\r\nin a soldier, and honesty the only thing that can support a politician.\r\nThis way of thinking made the gentleman of whom I was just now speaking\r\nsay, he was glad any one had taken upon him to depreciate such unnatural\r\nfustian as the tragedy of \"Alexander.\" The character of that prince\r\nindeed was, that he was unequal, and given to intemperance; but in his\r\nsober moments, when he had warm in his imagination the precepts of his\r\ngreat instructor, he was a pattern of generous thoughts and\r\ndispositions, in opposition to the strongest desires which are incident\r\nto a youth and conqueror. But instead of representing that hero in the\r\nglorious character of generosity and chastity, in his treatment of the\r\nbeauteous family of Darius, he is drawn all along as a monster of lust,\r\nor of cruelty; as if the way to raise him to the degree of a hero were\r\nto make his character as little like that of a worthy man as possible.\r\nSuch rude and indigested draughts of things are the proper objects of\r\nridicule and contempt, and depreciating Alexander, as we have him drawn,\r\nis the only way of restoring him to what he was in himself. It is well\r\ncontrived of the players to let this part be followed by a true picture\r\nof life, in the comedy called, \"The Chances,\"[334] wherein Don John and\r\nConstantia are acted to the utmost perfection. There need not be a\r\ngreater instance of the force of action than in many incidents of this\r\nplay, where indifferent passages, and such that conduce only to the\r\ntacking of the scenes together, are enlivened with such an agreeable\r\ngesture and behaviour, as apparently shows what a play might be, though\r\nit is not wholly what a play should be.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 332: In reply to this suggestion that the character of\r\nPolypragmon was meant for Harley, Steele said, in the _Guardian_, No.\r\n53: \"I drew it as the most odious image I could paint of ambition....\r\nWhoever seeks employment for his own private interest, vanity, or pride,\r\nand not for the good of his prince and country, has his share in the\r\npicture of Polypragmon; and let this be the rule in examining that\r\ndescription, and I believe the Examiner will find others to whom he\r\nwould rather give a part of it, than to the person on whom I believe he\r\nbestows it, because he thinks he is the most capable of having his\r\nvengeance on me.... I have not, like him, fixed odious images on\r\npersons, but on vices.\" To this the _Examiner_ (vol. iv.

We were very well pleased with one\r\nanother the first day, every one endeavouring to recommend himself by\r\nhis good humour and complaisance to the rest of the company. This good\r\ncorrespondence did not last long; one of our party was soured the very\r\nfirst evening by a plate of butter which had not been melted to his\r\nmind, and which spoiled his temper to such a degree, that he continued\r\nupon the fret to the end of our journey. A second fell off from his good\r\nhumour the next morning, for no other reason that I could imagine, but\r\nbecause I chanced to step into the coach before him, and place myself on\r\nthe shady side. This however was but my own private guess, for he did\r\nnot mention a word of it, nor indeed of anything else, for three days\r\nfollowing. The rest of our company held out very near half the way, when\r\nof a sudden Mr. Sprightly fell asleep; and instead of endeavouring to\r\ndivert and oblige us, as he had hitherto done, carried himself with an\r\nunconcerned, careless, drowsy behaviour, till we came to our last stage.\r\nThere were three of us who still held up our heads, and did all we could\r\nto make our journey agreeable; but, to my shame be it spoken, about\r\nthree miles on this side Exeter, I was taken with an unaccountable fit\r\nof sullenness, that hung upon me for above three-score miles; whether\r\nit were for want of respect, or from an accidental tread upon my foot,\r\nor from a foolish maid's calling me \"The old gentleman,\" I cannot tell.\r\nIn short, there was but one who kept his good humour to the Land's End.\r\n\r\nThere was another coach that went along with us, in which I likewise\r\nobserved, that there were many secret jealousies, heartburnings, and\r\nanimosities: for when we joined companies at night, I could not but take\r\nnotice, that the passengers neglected their own company, and studied how\r\nto make themselves esteemed by us, who were altogether strangers to\r\nthem; till at length they grew so well acquainted with us, that they\r\nliked us as little as they did one another. When I reflect upon this\r\njourney, I often fancy it to be a picture of human life, in respect to\r\nthe several friendships, contracts, and alliances that are made and\r\ndissolved in the several periods of it. The most delightful and most\r\nlasting engagements are generally those which pass between man and\r\nwoman; and yet upon what trifles are they weakened, or entirely broken?\r\nSometimes the parties fly asunder, even in the midst of courtship, and\r\nsometimes grow cool in the very honey month. Some separate before the\r\nfirst child, and some after the fifth; others continue good till thirty,\r\nothers till forty; while some few, whose souls are of a happier make,\r\nand better fitted to one another, travel on together to the end of their\r\njourney in a continual intercourse of kind offices and mutual\r\nendearments.\r\n\r\nWhen we therefore choose our companions for life, if we hope to keep\r\nboth them and ourselves in good humour to the last stage of it, we must\r\nbe extremely careful in the choice we make, as well as in the conduct on\r\nour own part. When the persons to whom we join ourselves can stand an\r\nexamination, and bear the scrutiny, when they mend upon our acquaintance\r\nwith them, and discover new beauties the more we search into their\r\ncharacters, our love will naturally rise in proportion to their\r\nperfections.\r\n\r\nBut because there are very few possessed of such accomplishments of body\r\nand mind, we ought to look after those qualifications both in ourselves\r\nand others, which are indispensably necessary towards this happy union,\r\nand which are in the power of every one to acquire, or at least to\r\ncultivate and improve. These, in my opinion, are cheerfulness and\r\nconstancy. A cheerful temper joined with innocence will make beauty\r\nattractive, knowledge delightful, and wit good-natured. It will lighten\r\nsickness, poverty, and affliction; convert ignorance into an amiable\r\nsimplicity, and render deformity itself agreeable.\r\n\r\nConstancy is natural to persons of even tempers and uniform\r\ndispositions, and may be acquired by those of the greatest fickleness,\r\nviolence, and passion, who consider seriously the terms of union upon\r\nwhich they come together, the mutual interest in which they are engaged,\r\nwith all the motives that ought to incite their tenderness and\r\ncompassion towards those who have their dependence upon them, and are\r\nembarked with them for life in the same state of happiness or misery.\r\nConstancy, when it grows in the mind upon considerations of this nature,\r\nbecomes a moral virtue, and a kind of good nature, that is not subject\r\nto any change of health, age, fortune, or any of those accidents which\r\nare apt to unsettle the best dispositions that are founded rather in\r\nconstitution than in reason. Where such a constancy as this is wanting,\r\nthe most inflamed passion may fall away into coldness and indifference,\r\nand the most melting tenderness degenerate into hatred and aversion. I\r\nshall conclude this paper with a story that is very well known in the\r\nNorth of England.\r\n\r\nAbout thirty years ago, a packet-boat that had several passengers on\r\nboard was cast away upon a rock, and in so great danger of sinking, that\r\nall who were in it endeavoured to save themselves as well as they could,\r\nthough only those who could swim well had a bare possibility of doing\r\nit. Among the passengers there were two women of fashion, who seeing\r\nthemselves in such a disconsolate condition, begged of their husbands\r\nnot to leave them. One of them chose rather to die with his wife than to\r\nforsake her; the other, though he was moved with the utmost compassion\r\nfor his wife, told her, that for the good of their children it was\r\nbetter one of them should live, than both perish. By a great piece of\r\ngood luck, next to a miracle, when one of our good men had taken the\r\nlast and long farewell in order to save himself, and the other held in\r\nhis arms the person that was dearer to him than life, the ship was\r\npreserved. It is with a secret sorrow and vexation of mind that I must\r\ntell the sequel of the story, and let my reader know, that this faithful\r\npair who were ready to have died in each other's arms, about three years\r\nafter their escape, upon some trifling disgust, grew to a coldness at\r\nfirst, and at length fell out to such a degree, that they left one\r\nanother and parted for ever. The other couple lived together in an\r\nuninterrupted friendship and felicity; and what was remarkable, the\r\nhusband whom the shipwreck had like to have separated from his wife,\r\ndied a few months after her, not being able to survive the loss of her.\r\n\r\nI must confess, there is something in the changeableness and inconstancy\r\nof human nature, that very often both dejects and terrifies me. Whatever\r\nI am at present, I tremble to think what I may be. While I find this\r\nprinciple in me, how can I assure myself that I shall be always true to\r\nmy God, my friend, or myself? In short, without constancy there is\r\nneither love, friendship, nor virtue in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 193.                                                [STEELE.[335]\r\n\r\nFrom _Saturday, July 1_, to _Tuesday, July 4, 1710_.\r\n\r\n    Qui didicit, patriæ quid debeat et quid amicis,\r\n    Quo sit amore parens, quo frater amandus, et hospes ...\r\n    Scribere[336] personæ scit convenientia cuique.\r\n                                              HOR., Ars Poet. 312.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_Will's Coffee-house, July 3._\r\n\r\nI have of late received many epistles, wherein the writers treat me as a\r\nmercenary person, for some late hints concerning matters which they\r\nthink I should not have touched upon but for sordid considerations. It\r\nis apparent, that my motive could not be of that kind; for when a man\r\ndeclares himself openly on one side, that party will take no more notice\r\nof him, because he is sure; and the set of men whom he declares against,\r\nfor the same reason are violent against him. Thus it is folly in a\r\nplain-dealer to expect, that either his friends will reward him, or his\r\nenemies forgive him. For which reason, I thought it was the shortest way\r\nto impartiality, to put myself beyond further hopes or fears, by\r\ndeclaring myself, at a time when the dispute is not about persons and\r\nparties, but things and causes. To relieve myself from the vexation\r\nwhich naturally attends such reflections, I came hither this evening to\r\ngive my thoughts quite a new turn, and converse with men of pleasure and\r\nwit, rather than those of business and intrigue. I had hardly entered\r\nthe room, when I was accosted by Mr. Thomas Doggett, who desired my\r\nfavour in relation to the play which was to be acted for his benefit on\r\nThursday. He pleased me in saying it was \"The Old Bachelor,\"[337] in\r\nwhich comedy there is a necessary circumstance observed by the author,\r\nwhich most other poets either overlook or do not understand, that is to\r\nsay, the distinction of characters. It is very ordinary with writers to\r\nindulge a certain modesty of believing all men as witty as themselves,\r\nand making all the persons of the play speak the sentiments of the\r\nauthor, without any manner of respect to the age, fortune, or quality of\r\nhim that is on the stage. Ladies talk like rakes, and footmen make\r\nsimiles: but this writer knows men, which makes his plays reasonable\r\nentertainments, while the scenes of most others are like the tunes\r\nbetween the acts. They are perhaps agreeable sounds, but they have no\r\nideas affixed to them. Doggett thanked me for my visit to him in the\r\nwinter,[338] and, after his comical manner, spoke his request with so\r\narch a leer, that I promised the droll I would speak to all my\r\nacquaintance to be at his play.\r\n\r\nWhatever the world may think of the actors, whether it be that their\r\nparts have an effect on their lives, or whatever it is, you see a\r\nwonderful benevolence among them towards the interests and necessities\r\nof each other. Doggett therefore would not let me go, without delivering\r\nme a letter from poor old Downes the prompter,[339] wherein that\r\nretainer to the theatre desires my advice and assistance in a matter of\r\nconcern to him. I have sent him my private opinion for his conduct; but\r\nthe stage and the State affairs being so much canvassed by parties and\r\nfactions, I shall for some time hereafter take leave of subjects which\r\nrelate to either of them, and employ my care in consideration of matters\r\nwhich regard that part of mankind who live without interesting\r\nthemselves with the troubles or pleasures of either. However, for a mere\r\nnotion of the present posture of the stage, I shall give you the letter\r\nat large as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"HONOURED SIR,                                   _July 1, 1710._\r\n\r\n     \"Finding by divers of your late papers, that you are a friend to\r\n     the profession of which I was many years an unworthy member, I the\r\n     rather make bold to crave your advice, touching a proposal that has\r\n     been lately made me of coming into business, and the\r\n     sub-administration of stage affairs. I have, from my youth, been\r\n     bred up behind the curtain, and been a prompter from the time of\r\n     the Restoration.[340] I have seen many changes, as well of scenes\r\n     as of actors, and have known men within my remembrance arrive to\r\n     the highest dignities of the theatre, who made their entrance in\r\n     the quality of mutes, joint-stools, flowerpots, and tapestry\r\n     hangings. It cannot be unknown to the nobility and gentry, that a\r\n     gentleman of the Inns of Court, and a deep intriguer, had some time\r\n     since worked himself into the sole management and direction of the\r\n     theatre.[341] Nor is it less notorious, that his restless ambition,\r\n     and subtle machinations, did manifestly tend to the extirpation of\r\n     the good old British actors, and the introduction of foreign\r\n     pretenders; such as harlequins, French dancers, and Roman singers;\r\n     which, though they impoverished the proprietors, and imposed on the\r\n     audience, were for some time tolerated, by reason of his dexterous\r\n     insinuations, which prevailed upon a few deluded women, especially\r\n     the vizard masks, to believe that the stage was in danger. But his\r\n     schemes were soon exposed, and the great ones that supported him\r\n     withdrawing their favour, he made his exit, and remained for a\r\n     season in obscurity. During this retreat the Machiavelian was not\r\n     idle, but secretly fomented divisions, and wrought over to his\r\n     side some of the inferior actors, reserving a trap-door to himself,\r\n     to which only he had a key. This entrance secured, this cunning\r\n     person, to complete his company, bethought himself of calling in\r\n     the most eminent of strollers from all parts of the kingdom. I have\r\n     seen them all ranged together behind the scenes; but they are many\r\n     of them persons that never trod the stage before, and so very\r\n     awkward and ungainly, that it is impossible to believe the audience\r\n     will bear them. He was looking over his catalogue of plays, and\r\n     indeed picked up a good tolerable set of grave faces for\r\n     counsellors, to appear in the famous scene of 'Venice Preserved,'\r\n     when the danger is over; but they being but mere outsides, and the\r\n     actors having a great mind to play 'The Tempest,' there is not a\r\n     man of them, when he is to perform anything above dumb show, is\r\n     capable of acting with a good grace so much as the part of\r\n     Trinculo. However, the master persists in his design, and is\r\n     fitting up the old 'storm'; but I am afraid he will not be able to\r\n     procure able sailors or experienced officers for love or money.\r\n\r\n     \"Besides all this, when he comes to cast the parts, there is so\r\n     great a confusion amongst them for want of proper actors, that for\r\n     my part I am wholly discouraged. The play with which they design to\r\n     open is, 'The Duke and No Duke';[342] and they are so put to it,\r\n     that the master himself is to act the conjurer, and they have no\r\n     one for the general but honest George Powell.[343]\r\n\r\n     \"Now, sir, they being so much at a loss for the _dramatis personæ_,\r\n     viz., the persons to enact, and the whole frame of the house being\r\n     designed to be altered, I desire your opinion, whether you think it\r\n     advisable for me to undertake to prompt them? For though I can\r\n     clash swords when they represent a battle, and have yet lungs\r\n     enough to huzza their victories, I question, if I should prompt\r\n     them right, whether they would act accordingly. I am\r\n\r\n                              \"Your Honour's most humble Servant,\r\n                                                          \"J. Downes.\r\n\r\n     \"P.S. Sir, since I writ this, I am credibly informed, that they\r\n     design a new house in Lincoln's Inn Fields, near the Popish\r\n     chapel,[344] to be ready by Michaelmas next; which indeed is but\r\n     repairing an old one that has already failed. You know the honest\r\n     man who kept the office is gone already.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 335: The authorship of the greater part of this paper is\r\nuncertain; see note on next page.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 336: \"Reddere\" (Horace).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 337: See No. 9.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 338: See Nos. 120, 122. In the continuation of the Tatler\r\nwhich Swift and Harrison conducted (No. 28, March 24, 1710-11) there is\r\nthis passage: \"The person produced as mine in the playhouse, last\r\nwinter, did in no wise appertain to me. It was such a one, however, as\r\nagreed well with the impression my writings had made, and served the\r\npurpose I intended it for: which was to continue the awe and reverence\r\ndue to the character I was vested with, and at the same time to let my\r\nenemies see how much I was the delight and favourite of this town,\" &c.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 339: This letter, in ridicule of Harley's newly formed\r\nMinistry, has been attributed to the joint authorship of Anthony Henley\r\n(see No. 11) and Temple Stanyan. Harley is supposed to be the gentleman\r\nreferred to in the letter, and Downes, it has been suggested, is Thomas\r\nOsborne, first Duke of Leeds. Steele expressly disavowed responsibility\r\nfor the letter from Downes the prompter. In No. 53 of the _Guardian_ he\r\nwrote: \"Old Downes is a fine piece of raillery, of which I wish I had\r\nbeen author. All I had to do in it, was to strike out what related to a\r\ngentlewoman about the Queen, whom I thought a woman free from ambition,\r\nand I did it out of regard to innocence.\" And in the Preface to the\r\n_Tatler_, he said that this letter was by an unknown correspondent. A\r\nwriter in the _Examiner_ (vol. iv. No. 2) mentions Old Downes among the\r\nsufferers of figure under our author's satire. The same writer, or\r\nanother in the same paper, expresses himself in the following words:\r\n\"Steele broke his own maxim for trifles in which his country had no\r\nmanner of concern; and by entering into party disputes, violated the\r\nmost solemn repeated promises and that perfect neutrality he had engaged\r\nto maintain. As a proof that I did not wrong him, he now openly takes\r\nupon himself Downes' letter, by wishing the raillery (as he calls it)\r\nwere his own.\" In the \"Essays Divine, Moral, and Political\" (1714), p.\r\n42, Swift is made to say, \"I advised him [Steele] to the publishing that\r\nletter from Downes the prompter, which was the beginning of his ruin,\r\nthough I here declare I did not write it.\" Forster (\"Biographical\r\nEssays,\" 3rd ed.) concludes that this fictitious letter was certainly by\r\nMainwaring himself. In the \"Journal to Stella\" (Oct. 22, 1710), Swift\r\nwrote: \"He [Steele] has lost his place of Gazetteer, three hundred\r\npounds a year, for writing a _Tatler_, some months ago, against Mr.\r\nHarley, who gave it him at first, and raised the salary from sixty to\r\nthree hundred pounds.\" See also Swift's \"The Importance of the\r\n_Guardian_ considered.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 340: John Downes was prompter to \"The Duke's Servants\" until\r\n1706. In 1708 he published his valuable \"Roscius Anglicanus, or an\r\nHistorical Review of the Stage.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 341: Christopher Rich, who began life as an attorney.
