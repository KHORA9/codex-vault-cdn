In some quarters new educational canons have\r\nspoken an emphatic condemnation of the college lecture, and it would\r\nseem to be high time to consider its value, as illustrative of an art\r\nabout to be lost, if not as exemplary of forces to be retained, even\r\nif modified. Are not our college class-rooms, in being robbed of the\r\nold-time lecture, and getting instead a science-brief of _data_ and\r\nbibliography, being deprived also of that literary atmosphere which\r\nonce pervaded them? We are unquestionably gaining in thoroughness;\r\nbut are we gaining in thoughtfulness? We are giving to many youths an\r\ninsight, it may be profound, into specialties; but are we giving any of\r\nthem a broad outlook?\r\n\r\nThere was too often a paralysis of dulness in the old lecture, or,\r\nrather, in the old lecturer; and written lectures, like history and\r\nfashion in dress, have an inveterate tendency to repeat themselves;\r\nbut, on the contrary, there was often a wealth of power also in the\r\nstudied discourse of strong men. Masters bent upon instructing and\r\ninspiring--and there were many such--had to penetrate that central\r\nsecret of literature and spoken utterance--the secret of style. Their\r\nonly instrument of conquest was the sword of penetrating speech.\r\nSome of the subtlest and most lasting effects of genuine oratory\r\nhave gone forth from secluded lecture desks into the hearts of quiet\r\ngroups of students; and it would seem to be good policy to endure\r\nmuch indifferent lecturing--watchful trustees might reduce it to a\r\nminimum--for the sake of leaving places open for the men who have in\r\nthem the inestimable force of chastened eloquence. For one man who\r\ncan impart an undying impulse there are several score, presupposing\r\nthe requisite training, who can impart a method; and here is the well\r\nunderstood ground for the cumulating disfavor of college lecturing and\r\nthe rapid substitution of ‘laboratory drill.’ But will not higher\r\neducation be cut off from communion with the highest of all forces, the\r\nforce of personal inspiration in the field of great themes of thought,\r\nif you interdict the literary method in the class-room?\r\n\r\nI am not inclined to consume very many words in insisting on this\r\npoint, for I believe that educators are now dealing more frankly with\r\nthemselves than ever before, and that so obvious a point will by no\r\nmeans escape full recognition before reformed methods of college and\r\nuniversity instruction take their final shape. But it is very well to\r\nbe thinking explicitly about the matter meanwhile, in order that the\r\nlecture may be got ready to come fully militant into the final battle\r\nfor territory. The best way to compass this end would seem to be, to\r\nstudy the art of the old masters of learned discourse. With Lanfranc\r\none could get the infinite charm of the old monastic school life;\r\nwith Abelard, the undying excitement of philosophical and religious\r\ncontroversy; with Colet, the fire of reforming zeal; with Blackstone,\r\nthe satisfactions of clarified learning. But Bee and Paris and Oxford\r\nhave by no means monopolized the masters of this art, and I should\r\nprefer, for the nonce at least, to choose an exemplar from Scotland,\r\nand speak of Adam Smith. It will, no doubt, be possible to speak of him\r\nwithout going over again the well worn ground of the topics usually\r\nassociated with his great fame.\r\n\r\nThere is much, besides the contents of his published works, to draw\r\nto Adam Smith the attention of those who are attracted by individual\r\npower. Scotchmen have long been reputed strong in philosophic doctrine,\r\nand he was a Scot of the Scots. But, though Scotland is now renowned\r\nfor her philosophy, that renown is not of immemorial origin; it was not\r\ntill the last century was well advanced that she began to add great\r\nspeculative thinkers to her great preachers. Adam Smith, consequently,\r\nstands nearly at the opening of the greatest of the intellectual eras\r\nof Scotland. Yet by none of the great Scotch names which men have\r\nlearned since his day has his name been eclipsed. The charm about the\r\nman consists, for those who do not regard him with the special interest\r\nof the political economist, in his literary method, which exhibits\r\nhis personality so attractively and makes his works so thoroughly his\r\nown, rather than in any facts about his eminency among Scotchmen. You\r\nbring away from your reading of Adam Smith a distinct and attractive\r\nimpression of the man himself, such as you can get from the writings of\r\nno other author in the same field, and such as makes you wish to know\r\nstill more of him. What was he like? What was his daily life?\r\n\r\nUnhappily, we know very little that is detailed of Adam Smith as a\r\nman; and it may be deplored, without injustice to a respected name,\r\nthat we owe that little to Dugald Stewart, who was too self-conscious\r\nand too stately to serve another efficiently as biographer. There\r\nwas no suitable place amid the formal spaces of his palatial style\r\nfor small illuminating details. Even from Dugald Stewart, however,\r\nwe get a picture of Adam Smith which must please every one who loves\r\nsimplicity and genuineness. He was not, perhaps, a companionable man;\r\nhe was much too absent-minded to be companionable; but he was, in\r\nthe highest sense, interesting. His absent-mindedness was of that\r\nsort which indicates fulness of mind, which marks a mind content,\r\nmuch of the time, to live within itself, indulging in those delights\r\nof quiet contemplation which the riches of a full store of thought\r\ncan always command. Often he would open to his companions his mind’s\r\nfullest confidences, and, with a rare versatility, lavish a wealth of\r\ninformation and illustration upon topics the most varied and diverse,\r\nalways to the wondering delight of those who heard him.\r\n\r\nAll who met Adam Smith in intimate intercourse are said to have been\r\nstruck chiefly by the gentleness and benignity of his manner--traits\r\nwhich would naturally strike one in a Scotchman; for men of that\r\nunbending race are not often distinguished by easiness of temper or\r\nsuavity of manner, but are generally both _fortiter in re et fortiter\r\nin modo_. His gentleness was, possibly, only one phase of that timidity\r\nwhich is natural to absent-minded men, and which was always conspicuous\r\nin him. That timidity made it rare with him to talk much. When he\r\ndid talk, as I have said, his hearers marvelled at the ingenuity of\r\nhis reasoning, at the constructive power of his imagination, at the\r\ncomprehensiveness of his memory, at the fertility of all his resources;\r\nbut his inclination was always to remain silent. He was not, however,\r\ndisinclined to public discourse, and it is chiefly to his unusual\r\ngifts as a lecturer that he seems to have owed his advancement in the\r\nliterary, or, rather, in the university, world.\r\n\r\nActing upon the advice of Lord Kames, an eminent barrister and a man of\r\nsome standing in the history of philosophy, he volunteered a course of\r\nlectures in Edinburgh almost immediately upon his return from Oxford;\r\nand the success of this course was hardly assured before he was elected\r\nto the chair of Logic in the University of Glasgow. In the following\r\nyear he had the honor of succeeding to the chair of Moral Philosophy,\r\nonce occupied by the learned and ingenious Hutcheson. He seems to have\r\nbeen at once successful in raising his new chair to a position of the\r\nvery highest consideration. His immediate predecessor had been one\r\nThomas Craigie, who has left behind him so shadowy a reputation that it\r\nis doubtless safe to conclude that his department was, at his death,\r\nmuch in need of a fresh infusion of life. This it received from Adam\r\nSmith. The breadth and variety of the topics upon which he chose to\r\nlecture, and the felicity, strength, and vitality of the exposition\r\nhe gave them (we are told by one who had sat under him), soon drew\r\nto Glasgow “a multitude of students from a great distance” to hear\r\nhim. His mastery of the art of academic lecturing was presently an\r\nestablished fact. It appears clear that his success was due to two\r\nthings: the broad outlook of his treatment and the fine art of his\r\nstyle. His chair was Moral Philosophy; and ‘moral philosophy’ seems\r\nto have been the most inclusive of general terms in the university\r\nusage of Scotland at that day, and, indeed, for many years afterward.\r\nApparently it embraced all philosophy that did not directly concern the\r\nphenomena of the physical world, and, accordingly, allowed its doctors\r\nto give very free play to their tastes in the choice of subjects.\r\nAdam Smith, in Glasgow, could draw within the big family of this\r\nlarge-hearted philosophy not only the science of mental phenomena,\r\nbut also the whole of the history and organization of society; just\r\nas, years afterwards, John Wilson, in Edinburgh, could insist upon the\r\nadoption of something very like _belles-lettres_ into the same generous\r\nand unconventional family circle.\r\n\r\nAdam Smith sought to cover the field he had chosen with a fourfold\r\ncourse of lectures. First, he unfolded the principles of natural\r\ntheology; second, he illustrated the principles of ethics, in a series\r\nof lectures which were afterwards embodied in his published work on\r\nthe “Theory of Moral Sentiments;” third, he discoursed on that branch\r\nof morality which relates to the administration of justice; and, last,\r\ncoming out upon the field with which his name is now identified, he\r\nexamined those political regulations which are founded, not upon\r\nprinciples of justice, but upon considerations of expediency, and which\r\nare calculated to increase the riches, the power, and the prosperity\r\nof the State. His notes of his lectures he himself destroyed when he\r\nfelt death approaching, and we are left to conjecture what the main\r\nfeatures of his treatment were, from the recorded recollections of\r\nhis pupils and from those published works which remain as fragments\r\nof the great plan. These fragments consist of the “Theory of Moral\r\nSentiments,” the “Wealth of Nations,” and “Considerations Concerning\r\nthe First Formation of Languages;” besides which there are, to quote\r\nanother’s enumeration, “a very curious history of astronomy, left\r\nimperfect, and another fragment on the history of ancient physics,\r\nwhich is a kind of sequel to that part of the history of astronomy\r\nwhich relates to ancient astronomy; then a similar essay on the ancient\r\nlogic and metaphysics; then another on the nature and development of\r\nthe fine, or, as he calls them, the imitative, arts, painting, poetry,\r\nand music, in which was meant to have been included a history of the\r\ntheatre--all forming part, his executors tell us, ‘of a plan he had\r\nonce formed for giving a connected history of the liberal and elegant\r\narts;’” part, that is (to continue the quotation from Mr. Bagehot),\r\nof the “immense design of showing the origin and development of\r\ncultivation and law, or ... of saying how, from being a savage, man\r\nrose to be a Scotchman.”\r\n\r\nThe wideness of view and amazing variety of illustration that\r\ncharacterized his treatment, in developing the several parts of this\r\nvast plan, can easily be inferred from an examination of the “Wealth of\r\nNations.”\r\n\r\n“The ‘Wealth of Nations,’” declares Mr. Buckle, from whom, for\r\nobvious reasons, I prefer to quote, “displays a breadth of treatment\r\nwhich those who cannot sympathize with, are very likely to ridicule.\r\nThe phenomena, not only of wealth, but also of society in general,\r\nclassified and arranged under their various forms; the origin of\r\nthe division of labor, and the consequences which that division has\r\nproduced; the circumstances which gave rise to the invention of money,\r\nand to the subsequent changes in its value; the history of those\r\nchanges traced in different ages, and the history of the relations\r\nwhich the precious metals bear to each other; an examination of the\r\nconnection between wages and profits, and of the laws which govern\r\nthe rise and fall of both; another examination of the way in which\r\nthese are concerned, on the one hand with the rent of land, and, on\r\nthe other hand, with the price of commodities; an inquiry into the\r\nreason why profits vary in different trades, and at different times;\r\na succinct but comprehensive view of the progress of towns in Europe\r\nsince the fall of the Roman Empire; the fluctuations, during several\r\ncenturies, in the prices of the food of the people, and a statement\r\nof how it is, that, in different stages of society, the relative cost\r\nof meat and of land varies; the history of corporation laws and of\r\nmunicipal enactments, and their bearing on the four great classes of\r\napprentices, manufacturers, merchants, and landlords; an account of\r\nthe immense power and riches formerly enjoyed by the clergy, and of\r\nthe manner in which, as society advances, they gradually lose their\r\nexclusive privileges; the nature of religious dissent, and the reason\r\nwhy the clergy of the Established Church can never contend with it on\r\nterms of equality, and, therefore, call on the State to help them, and\r\nwish to persecute when they cannot persuade; why some sects profess\r\nmore ascetic principles, and others more luxurious ones; how it was,\r\nthat, during the feudal times, the nobles acquired their power, and how\r\nthat power has, ever since, been gradually diminishing; how the rights\r\nof territorial jurisdiction originated, and how they died away; how the\r\nsovereigns of Europe obtained their revenue, what the sources of it\r\nare, and what classes are most heavily taxed in order to supply it; the\r\ncause of certain virtues, such as hospitality, flourishing in barbarous\r\nages, and decaying in civilized ones; the influence of inventions and\r\ndiscoveries in altering the distribution of power among the various\r\nclasses of society; a bold and masterly sketch of the peculiar sort\r\nof advantages which Europe derived from the discovery of America and\r\nof the passage round the Cape; the origin of universities, their\r\ndegeneracy from the original plan, the corruption which has gradually\r\ncrept over them, and the reason why they are so unwilling to adopt\r\nimprovements, and to keep pace with the wants of the age; a comparison\r\nbetween public and private education, and an estimate of their relative\r\nadvantages; these, and a vast number of other subjects, respecting\r\nthe structure and development of society, such as the feudal system,\r\nslavery, emancipation of serfs, origin of standing armies and of\r\nmercenary troops, effects produced by tithes, laws of primogeniture,\r\nsumptuary laws, international treaties concerning trade, rise of\r\nEuropean banks, national debts, influence of dramatic representations\r\nover opinions, colonies, poor-laws--all topics of a miscellaneous\r\ncharacter, and many of them diverging from each other--all are fused\r\ninto one great system, and irradiated by the splendor of one great\r\ngenius. Into that dense and disorderly mass, did Adam Smith introduce\r\nsymmetry, method, and law.”\r\n\r\nIn fact, it is a book of digressions--digressions characterized by more\r\norder and method, but by little more compunction, than the wondrous\r\ndigressions of Tristram Shandy.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that even this vast miscellany of thought,\r\nthe “Wealth of Nations,” systematized though it be, was not meant to\r\nstand alone as the exposition of a complete system; it was only a\r\nsupplement to the “Theory of Moral Sentiments;” and the two together\r\nconstituted only chapters in that vast book of thought which their\r\nauthor would have written. Adam Smith would have grouped all things\r\nthat concern either the individual or the social life of man under the\r\nseveral greater principles of motive and action observable in human\r\nconduct. His method throughout is, therefore, necessarily abstract\r\nand deductive. In the “Wealth of Nations,” he ignores the operation\r\nof love, of benevolence, of sympathy, and of charity in filling life\r\nwith kindly influences, and concentrates his attention exclusively upon\r\nthe operation of self-interest and expediency; because he had reckoned\r\nwith the altruistic motives in the “Theory of Moral Sentiments,” and\r\nhe would not confuse his view of the economic life of man by again\r\nforcing these in where selfishness was unquestionably the predominant\r\nforce. “The philosopher,” he held, “is the man of speculation, whose\r\ntrade is not to do anything, but to observe everything;” and certainly\r\nhe satisfied his own definition. He does observe everything; and he\r\nstores his volumes full with the sagest practical maxims, fit to have\r\nfallen from the lips of the shrewdest of those Glasgow merchants\r\nin whose society he learned so much that might test the uses of his\r\ntheories. But it is noticeable that none of the carefully noted facts\r\nof experience which play so prominent a part on the stage of his\r\nargument speaks of any other principle than the simple and single one\r\nwhich is the pivot of that part of his philosophy with which he is at\r\nthe moment dealing. In the “Wealth of Nations” every apparent induction\r\nleads to self-interest, and to self-interest alone. In Mr. Buckle’s\r\nphrase, his facts are subsequent to his argument; they are not used for\r\ndemonstration, but for illustration. His historical cases, his fine\r\ngeneralizations, everywhere broadening and strengthening his matter,\r\nare only instances of the operation of the single abstract principle\r\nmeant to be set forth.\r\n\r\nWhen he was considering that topic in his course which has not come\r\ndown to us in any of the remaining fragments of his lectures--the\r\nprinciples of justice, namely--although still always mindful of its\r\nrelative position in the general scheme of his abstract philosophy\r\nof society, his subject led him, we are told, to speak very much\r\nin the modern historical spirit. He followed upon this subject,\r\nsays the pupil already quoted, “the plan which seems to have been\r\nsuggested by Montesquieu; endeavoring to trace the gradual progress\r\nof jurisprudence, both public and private, from the rudest to the\r\nmost refined ages, and to point out the effects of those arts which\r\ncontribute to subsistence, and to the accumulation of property,\r\nin producing corresponding improvements or alterations in law and\r\ngovernment.” In following Montesquieu, he was, of course, following\r\none of the forerunners of that great school of philosophical students\r\nof history which has done so much in our own time to clear away the\r\nfogs that surround the earliest ages of mankind, and to establish\r\nsomething like the rudiments of a true philosophy of history. And this\r\nsame spirit was hardly less discernible in those later lectures on the\r\n“political institutions relating to commerce, to finances, and to the\r\necclesiastical and military establishments,” which formed the basis of\r\nthe “Wealth of Nations.” Everywhere throughout his writings there is a\r\npervasive sense of the realities of fact and circumstance; a luminous,\r\nbracing, work-a-day atmosphere. But the conclusions are, first of all,\r\nphilosophical; only secondarily practical.\r\n\r\nIt has been necessary to go over this somewhat familiar ground with\r\nreference to the philosophical method of Adam Smith, in order to come\r\nat the proper point of view from which to consider his place among the\r\nold masters of academic lecturing. It has revealed the extent of his\r\noutlook. There yet remains something to be said of his literary method,\r\nso that we may discern the qualities of that style which, after proving\r\nso effectual in imparting power to his spoken discourses, has since,\r\ntransferred to the printed page, preserved his fame so far beyond the\r\nlifetime of those who heard him.\r\n\r\nAdam Smith took strong hold upon his hearers, as he still takes strong\r\nhold upon his readers, by force, partly, of his native sagacity, but\r\nby virtue, principally, of his consummate style. The success of his\r\nlectures was not altogether a triumph of natural gifts; it was, in\r\ngreat part, a triumph of sedulously cultivated art. With the true\r\ninstinct of the orator and teacher, Adam Smith saw--what every one\r\nmust see who speaks not for the patient ear of the closeted student\r\nonly, but also to the often shallow ear of the pupil in the class-room,\r\nand to the always callous ear of the great world outside, which must\r\nbe tickled in order to be made attentive--that clearness, force, and\r\nbeauty of style are absolutely necessary to one who would draw men to\r\nhis way of thinking; nay, to any one who would induce the great mass\r\nof mankind to give so much as passing heed to what he has to say. He\r\nknew that wit was of no avail, without wit’s proper words; sagacity\r\nmean, without sagacity’s mellow measures of phrase. He bestowed the\r\nmost painstaking care, therefore, not only upon what he was to say,\r\nbut also upon the way in which he was to say it. Dugald Stewart speaks\r\nof “that flowing and apparently artless style, which he had studiously\r\ncultivated, but which, after all his experience in composition, he\r\nadjusted, with extreme difficulty, to his own taste.” The results\r\nwere such as to offset entirely his rugged utterance and his awkward,\r\nangular action, and to enable the timid talker to exercise the spells\r\nof an orator. The charm of his discourses consisted in the power of\r\nstatement which gave them life, in the clear and facile processes\r\nof proof which gave them speed, and in the vigorous, but chastened,\r\nimagination which lent them illumination. He constantly refreshed and\r\nrewarded his hearers, as he still constantly refreshes and rewards his\r\nreaders, by bringing them to those clear streams of practical wisdom\r\nand happy illustration which everywhere irrigate his expositions. His\r\ncounsel, even on the highest themes, was always undarkened. There\r\nwere no clouds about his thoughts; the least of these could be seen\r\nwithout glasses through the transparent atmosphere of expression which\r\nsurrounded them. He was a great thinker,--and that was much; but he\r\nalso made men recognize him as a great thinker, because he was a great\r\nmaster of style--which was more. He did not put his candle under a\r\nbushel, but on a candlestick.\r\n\r\nIn Doctor Barnard’s verses, addressed to Sir Joshua Reynolds and his\r\nliterary friends, Adam Smith is introduced as a peer amidst that\r\nbrilliant company:\r\n\r\n    “If I have thoughts and can’t express ’em,\r\n    Gibbon shall teach me how to dress ’em\r\n        In words select and terse;\r\n    Jones teach me modesty and Greek,\r\n    _Smith how to think_, Burke how to speak,\r\n        And Beauclerc to converse.”\r\n\r\nIt is this power of teaching other men how to think that has given\r\nto the works of Adam Smith an immortality of influence. In his first\r\nuniversity chair, the chair of Logic, he had given scant time to the\r\ninvestigation of the formal laws of reasoning, and had insisted,\r\nby preference, upon the practical uses of discourse, as the living\r\napplication of logic, treating of style and of the arts of persuasion\r\nand exposition; and here in his other chair, of Moral Philosophy,\r\nhe was practically illustrating the vivifying power of the art he\r\nhad formerly sought to expound to his pupils. “When the subject of\r\nhis work,” says Dugald Stewart, speaking of the “Theory of Moral\r\nSentiments,” “when the subject of his work leads him to address\r\nthe imagination and the heart, the variety and felicity of his\r\nillustrations, the richness and fluency of his eloquence, and the skill\r\nwith which he wins the attention and commands the passions of his\r\nhearers, leave him, among our English moralists, without a rival.”\r\n\r\nSuch, then, were the matters which this great lecturer handled, and\r\nsuch was the form he gave them. Two personal characteristics stand out\r\nin apparent contrast with what he accomplished: he is said to have been\r\nextremely unpractical in the management of his own affairs, and yet he\r\nfathered that science which tells how other people’s affairs, how the\r\nworld’s affairs, are managed; he is known to have been shy and silent,\r\nand yet he was the most acceptable lecturer of his university. But it\r\nis not uncommon for the man who is both profound and accurate in his\r\nobservation of the universal and permanent forces operative in the life\r\nabout him, to be almost altogether wanting in that sagacity concerning\r\nthe local and temporary practical details upon which the hourly\r\nfacilitation and comfort of his own life depend; nor need it surprise\r\nany one to find the man who sits shy and taciturn in private, stand out\r\ndominant and eloquent in public. “Commonly, indeed,” as Mr. Bagehot has\r\nsaid, “the silent man, whoso brain is loaded with unexpressed ideas,\r\nis more likely to be a successful public speaker than the brilliant\r\ntalker who daily exhausts himself in sharp sayings.” There are two\r\ndistinct kinds of observation: that which makes a man alert and shrewd,\r\ncognizant of every trifle and quick with every trick of speech; and\r\nthat which makes a man a philosopher, conscious of the steady set of\r\naffairs and ready in the use of all the substantial resources of wise\r\nthought. Commend me to the former for a chat; commend me to the latter\r\nfor a book. The first will sparkle; the other burns a steady flame.\r\n\r\nHere, then, is the picture of this Old Master: a quiet, awkward,\r\nforceful Scotchman, whose philosophy has entered everywhere into the\r\nlife of politics and become a world force in thought; an impracticable\r\nCommissioner of Customs, who has left for the instruction of statesmen\r\na theory of taxation; an unbusiness-like professor, who established\r\nthe science of business; a man of books, who is universally honored by\r\nmen of action; plain, eccentric, learned, inspired. The things that\r\nstrike us most about him are, his boldness of conception and wideness\r\nof outlook, his breadth and comprehensiveness of treatment, and his\r\ncarefully clarified and beautified style. He was no specialist, except\r\n_in the relations of things_.\r\n\r\nOf course, spreading his topics far and wide in the domain of history\r\nand philosophy, he was at many points superficial. He took most of his\r\nmaterials at second hand; and it has been said that he borrowed many of\r\nhis ideas from the French. But no matter who mined the gold, he coined\r\nit; the image and superscription are his. Certain separate, isolated\r\ntruths which served under him may have been doing individual, guerilla\r\nwarfare elsewhere for the advancement of science; but it was he who\r\nmarshalled them into drilled hosts for the conquering of the nations.\r\nAdam Smith was doubtless indebted to the Physiocrats, but all the world\r\nis indebted to Adam Smith. Education and the world of thought need men\r\nwho, like this man, will dare to know a multitude of things. Without\r\nthem and their bold synthetic methods, all knowledge and all thought\r\nwould fall apart into a weak analysis. Their minds do not lack in\r\nthoroughness; their thoroughness simply lacks in minuteness. It is only\r\nin their utterances that the mind finds the exhilaration and exaltation\r\nthat come with the free air that blows over broad uplands. They excite\r\nyou with views of the large aspects of thought; conduct you through\r\nthe noblest scenery of the mind’s domain; delight you with majesty of\r\noutline and sweep of prospect. In this day of narrow specialties, our\r\nthinking needs such men to fuse its parts, correlate its forces, and\r\ncentre its results; and our thinking needs them in its college stage,\r\nin order that we may command horizons from our study windows in after\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nThe breadth and comprehensiveness of treatment characteristic of\r\nthe utterances of such a teacher are inseparable attributes of his\r\nmanner of thought. He has the artist’s eye. For him things stand in\r\npicturesque relations; their great outlines fit into each other; the\r\ntouch of his treatment is necessarily broad and strong. The same\r\ninforming influence of artistic conception and combination gives to\r\nhis style its luminous and yet transparent qualities. His sentences\r\ncannot retain the stiff joints of logic; it would be death to them\r\nto wear the chains of formal statement; they must take leave to deck\r\nthemselves with eloquence. In a word, such men must write _literature_,\r\nor nothing. Their minds quiver with those broad sympathies which\r\nconstitute the life of written speech. Their native catholicity makes\r\nall minds receive them as kinsmen. By reason of the very strength of\r\ntheir humanity, they are enabled to say things long waiting to be said,\r\nin such a way that all men may receive them. They hold commissions\r\nfrom the King of Speech. Such men will not, I am persuaded, always\r\nseek in vain invitations to those academic platforms which are their\r\nbest coignes of vantage. But this is not just the time when they are\r\nmost appreciated, or most freely encouraged to discover themselves;\r\nand it cannot be amiss to turn back to another order of things, and\r\nremind ourselves how a master of academic inspiration, possessing, in\r\na great power to impart intellectual impulse, something higher than a\r\ntrained capacity to communicate method, may sometimes be found even in\r\na philosophical Scotchman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHE STUDY OF POLITICS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has long been an open secret that there is war among the political\r\neconomists. John Stuart Mill no longer receives universal homage,\r\nbut has to bear much irreverent criticism; even Adam Smith might be\r\nseriously cavilled at were not the habit of praise grown too old in his\r\ncase. He is still ‘the father of political economy;’ but, like other\r\nfathers of his day, he seems to us decidedly old fashioned. The fact\r\nis, that these older writers, who professed to point out the laws of\r\nhuman business, are accused of leaving out of view a full half of human\r\nnature; in insisting that men love gain, they are said to have quite\r\nforgotten that men sometimes love each other, that they are not only\r\nprehensile, but also a great many other things less aggressive and less\r\nselfish.\r\n\r\nThose who make these charges want to leave nothing human out of their\r\nreckonings; they want to know ‘all the facts,’ and are ready, if\r\nnecessary, to reduce every generalization of the older writers to the\r\nstate--the wholly _exceptional_ state--of a rule in German grammar.\r\nTheir protest is significant, their purpose heroic, beyond a doubt; and\r\nwhat interesting questions are not raised by their programme! How is\r\nthe world to contain the writings, statistical, historical, critical,\r\nwhich must be accumulated ere this enormous diagnosis of trade and\r\nmanufacture shall be completed in its details? And after it shall have\r\nbeen completed in detail who is to be born great enough in genius and\r\npatience to reduce the mass to a system comprehensible by ordinary\r\nmortals? Moreover, who is going surety that these new economists will\r\nnot be dreadful defaulters before they get through handling these\r\nimmense assets of human nature, which Mill confessed himself unable\r\nto handle without wrecking his bookkeeping? Are they assured of the\r\neventual collaboration of some Shakespeare who will set before the\r\nworld all the standard types of economic character? Let the world hope\r\nso. Even those who cannot answer the questions I have broached ought to\r\nbid such sturdy workers ‘God speed!’\r\n\r\nThe most interesting reflection suggested by the situation is, that\r\npolitical economists are being harassed by the same discipline of\r\nexperience that, one day or another, sobers all constructors of\r\nsystems. They cannot build in the air and then escape chagrin because\r\nmen only gaze at their structures, and will not live in them. Closet\r\nstudents of politics are constantly undergoing new drill in the same\r\nlesson: the world is an inexorable schoolmaster; it will have none\r\nof any thought which does not recognize it. Sometimes theorists like\r\nRousseau, being near enough the truth to deceive even those who know\r\nsomething of it, are so unfortunate as to induce men to rear fabrics of\r\ngovernment after their aerial patterns out of earth’s stuffs, with the\r\nresult of bringing every affair of weight crashing about their ears, to\r\nthe shaking of the world. But there are not many such coincidences as\r\nRousseau and his times, happily; and other closet politicians, more\r\ncommonly cast and more ordinarily placed than he, have had no such\r\nperilous successes.\r\n\r\nThere is every reason to believe that in countries where men vote as\r\nwell as write books, political writers at any rate give an honest\r\nrecognition of act to these facts. They do not vote their opinions,\r\nthey vote their party tickets; and they are the better citizens by far\r\nfor doing so. Inside their libraries they go with their masters in\r\nthought--mayhap go great lengths with Adolph Wagner, or hold stiffly\r\nback, “man _versus_ the state,” with Spencer; outside their libraries\r\nthey ‘go with their party.’ In a word, like sensible men, they frankly\r\nrecognize the difference between what is possible in thought and what\r\nis practicable in action.\r\n\r\nBut the trouble is, that when they turn from voting to writing they\r\ncall many of their abstract reflections on government studies of\r\n_politics_, and thereby lose the benefit of some very wholesome aids\r\nto just thought. Even when they draw near the actual life of living\r\ngovernments, as they frequently do, and read and compare statutes\r\nand constitutions, they stop short of asking and ascertaining what\r\nthe men of the street think and say of institutions and laws; what\r\nlittle, as well as what big, influences brought particular laws into\r\nexistence; how much of each law actually lives in the regulation of\r\npublic function or private activity, how much of it has degenerated\r\ninto ‘dead letter;’ in brief, just what things it is--what methods,\r\nwhat habits, what human characteristics and social conditions--that\r\nmake the appearance of politics outside the library so different from\r\nits appearance inside that quiet retreat; what it is that constitutes\r\n‘practical politics’ a peculiar province. And yet these are the\r\nquestions most necessary to be answered in order to reach the heart of\r\ntheir study.\r\n\r\nEvery one who has read great treatises on government which were not\r\nmerely speculative in their method must have been struck by their\r\nexhaustive knowledge of statutes, of judicial precedents, and of legal\r\nand constitutional history; and equally by their tacit ignorance of\r\nanything more than this gaunt skeleton of institutions. Their best\r\npages are often those on which a modest asterisk, an unobtrusive\r\nnumeral, or a tiny dagger sticking high in the stately text, carries\r\nthe eye down to a foot-note, packed close in small print, in which some\r\nhint is let drop of the fact that institutions have a _daily_ as well\r\nas an epochal life, from which the student might ‘learn something to\r\nhis advantage.’\r\n\r\nThe inherent weakness of such a method is shown by the readiness with\r\nwhich it is discredited when once a better one is put beside it. What\r\nmodern writer on political institutions has not felt, either directly\r\nor indirectly, the influence of de Tocqueville and Bagehot? Both these\r\ninimitable writers were men of extraordinary genius, and, whatever they\r\nmight have written about, their writings would have been admiringly\r\npreserved, if only for the wonder of their luminous qualities. But\r\ntheir political works live, not only as models of effective style,\r\nbut also as standards of stimulating wisdom; because Bagehot and de\r\nTocqueville were not merely students, but also _men of the world_, for\r\nwhom the only acceptable philosophy of politics was a generalization\r\nfrom actual daily observation of men and things. They could see\r\ninstitutions writ small in the most trivial turns of politics, and read\r\nconstitutions more clearly in a biography than in a statute-book. They\r\nwere men who, had they written history, would have written the history\r\nof peoples, and not of courts or parliaments merely. Their methods\r\nhave, therefore, because of their essential sanity, gone far toward\r\ndiscrediting all others; they have leavened the whole mass of political\r\nliterature. Was it not Bagehot, for instance, who made it necessary for\r\nProfessor Dicey to entitle his recent admirable work “The Law of the\r\nConstitution,” that no one might think he mistook it for the _Life_ of\r\nthe Constitution?\r\n\r\nWho has not wished that Burke had fused the permanent thoughts of\r\nhis splendid sentences of wisdom together into a noble whole, an\r\nincomparable treatise whereby every mind that loved liberty might be\r\nstrengthened and fertilized? He had handled affairs, and could pluck\r\nout the heart of their mystery with a skill that seldom blundered;\r\nhe spoke hardly a word of mere hearsay or speculation. He, it would\r\nseem, better than any other, could have shown writers on politics the\r\ndifference between knowledge and insight, between an acquaintance with\r\npublic law and a real mastery of the principles of government.\r\n\r\nNot that all ‘practical politicians’ would be the best instructors in\r\nthe deep--though they might be in the hidden--things of politics. Far\r\nfrom it. They are too thickly crowded by daily detail to see permanent\r\noutlines, too much pushed about by a thousand little influences to\r\ndetect accurately the force or the direction of the big and lasting\r\ninfluences. They ‘cannot see the forest for the trees.’ They are no\r\nmore fitted to be instructors _because_ they are practical politicians\r\nthan lawyers are fitted to fill law-school chairs because they are\r\nactive practitioners. They must be something else besides to qualify\r\nthem for the high function of teaching, and must be that something\r\nelse in so masterful a fashion that no distraction of active politics\r\ncan for a moment withdraw their vision from the great and continuous\r\nprinciples of their calling.\r\n\r\nThe active statesman is often an incomparable teacher, however, when\r\nhe is himself least conscious that he is teaching at all, when he has\r\nno thought of being didactic, but has simply a heart full of the high\r\npurpose of leading his fellow-countrymen to do those things which he\r\nconceives to be right. Read the purposes of men like Patrick Henry\r\nand Abraham Lincoln, men untutored of the schools--read their words\r\nof leadership, and say whether there be anything wiser than their\r\nhome-made wisdom.\r\n\r\nIt is such reflections as these--whether my examples be well chosen or\r\nnot--which seem to me to lead directly to the right principle of study\r\nfor every one who would go beyond the law and know the life of States.\r\nNot every State lets statutes die by mere disuse, as Scotland once\r\ndid; and if you are going to read constitutions with only lawyers for\r\nyour guides, be they never so learned, you must risk knowing only the\r\nanatomy of institutions, never learning anything of their biology.\r\n\r\n“Men of letters and of thought,” says Mr. Sidney Colvin, where one\r\nwould least expect to find such a remark--in a “Life of Walter Savage\r\nLandor”--\r\n\r\n    “Men of letters and of thought are habitually too much given to\r\n    declaiming at their ease against the delinquencies of men of\r\n    action and affairs. The inevitable friction of practical politics\r\n    generates heat enough already, and the office of the thinker and\r\n    critic should be to supply not heat, but light. The difficulties\r\n    which attend his own unmolested task, the task of seeking after and\r\n    proclaiming salutary truths, should teach him to make allowance for\r\n    the still more urgent difficulties which beset the politician--the\r\n    man obliged, amidst the clash of interests and temptations, to\r\n    practise from hand to mouth, and at his peril, the most uncertain\r\n    and at the same time the most indispensable of the experimental\r\n    arts.”\r\n\r\nExcellent! But why stop there? Must the man of letters and of thought\r\nobserve the friction of politics only to make due allowance for the\r\npractical politician, only to keep his own placid conclusions free\r\nfrom any taint of scorn or cavil at men whose lives are thrown amidst\r\naffairs to endure the buffetings of interest and resist the tugs of\r\ntemptation? Is not a just understanding of the conditions of practical\r\npolitics also an indispensable prerequisite to the discovery and\r\naudible proclamation of his own “salutary truths?” No truth which\r\ndoes not on all its sides touch human life can ever reach the heart\r\nof politics; and men of ‘unmolested tasks,’ of mere library calm,\r\nsimply cannot think the thoughts which will tell amidst the noise of\r\naffairs. An alert and sympathetic perception of the infinite shifts\r\nof circumstance and play of motive which control the actual conduct\r\nof government ought to permeate the thinking, as well as check the\r\ncriticisms, of writers on politics.\r\n\r\nIn a word, ought not the ‘man of the world’ and the ‘man of books’\r\nto be merged in each other in the student of politics? Was not John\r\nStuart Mill the better student for having served the East India Company\r\nand sat in the House of Commons? Are not Professor Bryce and Mr. John\r\nMorley more to be trusted in their books because they have proved\r\nthemselves worthy to be trusted in the Cabinet?\r\n\r\nThe success of great popular preachers contains a lesson for students\r\nof politics who would themselves convert men to a saving doctrine. The\r\npreacher has, indeed, an incalculable advantage over the student of\r\npolitics in having as his text-book that Bible which speaks of the\r\nhuman heart with a Maker’s knowledge of the thing He has made; by\r\nknowing his book he knows the deepest things of daily life. But the\r\ngreat preacher reaches the heart of his hearers not by knowledge, but\r\nby sympathy--by showing himself a brother-man to his fellow-men. And\r\nthis is just the principle which the student of politics must heed.\r\nHe must frequent the street, the counting-house, the drawing-room,\r\nthe club-house, the administrative offices, the halls--yes, and the\r\nlobbies--of legislatures. He must cross-examine the experience of\r\ngovernment officials; he must hear the din of conventions, and see\r\ntheir intrigues; he must witness the scenes of election day. He must\r\nknow how men who are not students regard government and its affairs.\r\nHe will get many valuable suggestions from such men on occasion;\r\nbetter than that, he will learn the available approaches to such men’s\r\nthoughts. Government is meant for the good of ordinary people, and it\r\nis for ordinary people that the student should elucidate its problems;\r\nlet him be anxious to keep within earshot of such.\r\n\r\nThis is not to commend the writer on politics to narrow ‘practical’\r\nviews and petty comment; it is not to ask him to find a philosophy of\r\ngovernment which will fit the understanding and please the taste of the\r\n‘ward politician:’ it is only to ask him to keep his generalizations\r\nfirmly bottomed on fact and experience. His philosophy will not\r\novershoot the hearts of men because it is feathered with high thought,\r\nunless it be deliberately shot in air. Thoughts do not fail of\r\nacceptance because they are not commonplace enough, but because they\r\nare not true enough; and, in the sort of writing about which we are\r\nhere speaking, truth is a thing which can be detected better by the man\r\nwho knows life than by the man who knows only logic. You cannot lift\r\ntruth so high that men cannot reach it; the only caution to be observed\r\nis, that you do not ask them to climb where they cannot go without\r\nleaving _terra firma_.\r\n\r\nNor is the student, who naturally and properly loves books, to leave\r\nbooks and sit all his time in wiseacre observation amidst busy men. His\r\nbooks are his balance--or, rather, his ballast. And of course the men\r\nof his own day are not the only men from whom he can learn politics.\r\nGovernment is as old as man; men have always been politicians; the\r\nmen of to-day are only politicians of a particular school; the past\r\nfurnishes examples of politicians of every other school, and there\r\nis as much to be learned about government from them as from their\r\nsuccessors.\r\n\r\nCarlyle had the sort of eye for which one should pray when seeking to\r\nfind men alive and things actual in the records left of them. Who has\r\nnot profited by his humorous familiarity with the foibles and personal\r\nhabits of the men who lived about the court of the Hohenzollerns?\r\nWho has not learned more than any other man could have told him of\r\nPrussian administration under its first great organizer by looking with\r\nCarlyle into the sociable informalities of Frederick William’s ‘tobacco\r\nparliament?’ Carlyle knew these men well enough to joke with and rail\r\nat them. He twitted them with their family secrets, and, knowing what\r\nclay they were of, was not awed by their state ceremonials. Yet he saw\r\nthem, as he himself bitterly complains, only through the medium of\r\ncrabbed documents and dry-as-dust books, with no seer like himself to\r\nhelp him in his interpretations. It was hard straining of the eyes to\r\nsee so far back through the dense and murky atmosphere of formal record\r\nand set history; but he saw, nevertheless, because he did not need to\r\nbe told all in order to know all; the dryest of historians could hardly\r\navoid dropping some hint which would suffice Carlyle more than would\r\ntomes of ‘profane history.’\r\n\r\nIf you know what you are looking for and are not expecting to find it\r\nadvertised in the newspapers, but lying somewhere beneath the surface\r\nof things, the dullest fool may often help you to its discovery. It\r\nneeds a good nose to do the thing, but look how excellent is the game\r\nto which a casual scent may bring you in such a domain as the study of\r\npolitics. There are whole worlds of fact waiting to be discovered by\r\ninference. Do not expect to find the life of constitutions painted in\r\nthe great ‘standard authorities,’ but, following with becoming patience\r\ntheir legal anatomy of institutions, watch their slightest movement\r\ntoward an illustrative foot-note, and try to find under that the scent\r\nyou are in quest of. If they cite an instance, seek the recital of the\r\nsame case elsewhere, where it is told with a different purpose; if it\r\npromise well there, hunt it further still, and make sure you catch\r\nevery glimpse it affords of men’s actual dealings with government. If\r\nyour text mention names of consequence, seek them out in biographies,\r\nand scan there the personal relations of men with affairs, for hints\r\nof the methods by which governments are operated from day to day. You\r\nwill not need any incentive to read all their gossip, in letters and\r\njournals, and so see governors as men; but do more: endure official\r\ninterviews and sessions of Parliament with them; collate their private\r\nletters and their public despatches--there’s no telling when or where\r\nyou shall strike fresh trails of the game you seek. Interview judges\r\noff the bench, courtiers away from court, officers off duty. Go to\r\nFrance and live next door a prefect in the provinces; go to London\r\nand try to find out how things of weight are talked about in the\r\nsmoking-room of the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nSuch excursions must, of course, lead the student far afield; he will\r\noften get quite out of sight of his starting-point, the ‘standard\r\nauthority;’ but he will not on that account be lost. The fact is,\r\nthat all literature teems with suggestions on this topic of politics.\r\nJust as the chance news item, the unstudied traveller’s reminiscence,\r\nthe passing social or financial scandal,[A] and every hint of any\r\npresent contact of men with law or authority, illuminates directly,\r\nor by inference, the institutions of our own day, similar random rays\r\nthrown across the pages of old books by the unpremeditated words of\r\nwriters quite guiltless of such instructive intent may light up, for\r\nthose who are alert to see such things, the most intimate secrets of\r\nstate. If it be beyond hoping for to find a _whole_ Greville for every\r\nage of government, there may be found Grevillian scraps, at least, in\r\nthe literature of almost every time. From men as far back and as well\r\nremembered as Cicero, down to men as recent and as easily forgotten\r\nas several who might be named, politicians have loved to explain to\r\nposterity the part they took in conspicuous affairs; and that portion\r\nof posterity which studies politics by inference ought to be profoundly\r\nthankful to them for yielding to the taste.\r\n\r\n    [A] Did not the Dilke trial in London, for instance, help us to\r\n        understand at least one influence that may sometimes make a\r\n        lawyer Home Secretary?\r\n\r\nApproach the life of States by such avenues, and you shall be convinced\r\nof the organic nature of political society. View society from what\r\npoint you will, you always catch sight of some part of government; man\r\nis so truly a ‘political animal’ that you cannot examine him at all\r\nwithout seeing the points--points of his very structure--whereat he\r\ntouches and depends upon, or upholds, the State.\r\n\r\nIn 1850, while Governor-General of Canada, Lord Elgin writes to Lord\r\nGrey:\r\n\r\n    “Our Reciprocity measure was pressed by us in Washington last\r\n    session, just as a railway bill, in 1845 or 1846, would have been\r\n    passed in Parliament. There was no Government to deal with, ...\r\n    it was all a matter of canvassing this member of Congress or the\r\n    other.”[B]\r\n\r\n    [B] Letters and Journals of Lord Elgin, p. 121.\r\n\r\nWhat? “No Government to deal with?” Here’s a central truth to be\r\nfound in none of the ‘standard authorities,’ and yet to be seen by a\r\npractised diplomatist all the way from Canada. About the same date\r\nM. Bacourt came to this country to represent the French Government\r\nand be made wretched by the crude deportment of the Americans. His\r\nchief concern was to get away to some country where people were less\r\nunconventionally at their ease in drawing-rooms; but he turned, when\r\nnecessary, to the business of his legation; and whenever he did so\r\nhe found that “here diplomatic affairs are not treated as everywhere\r\nelse, where we communicate with the Minister of Foreign Affairs and\r\narrange the matter with him alone.” He must ‘arrange’ the matter with\r\nseveral committees of Congress. He must go to see Mrs. Kennedy and Mrs.\r\nWinthrop, whose “husbands are members of the House of Representatives,\r\nand on the committee having charge of commercial affairs, in which”\r\nhe “is interested,” for “they say that these gentlemen are very\r\nparticular about visits from foreign ministers to their wives.”[C] Just\r\nLord Elgin’s testimony. Again the ‘standard authorities’ are added\r\nto, and that in a quarter where we should least expect to find them\r\nsupplemented. We need despair of no source.\r\n\r\n    [C] Souvenirs of a Diplomat, pp. 189, 281.\r\n\r\nThese are only near and easily recognized illustrations of the errant\r\nmode of study I am expounding and advocating. Other systems besides our\r\nown receive similar chance illumination in the odd corners of all sorts\r\nof books. Now and again you strike mines like the “Mémoires of Madame\r\nde Rémusat,” the “Letters” of Walpole, or the “Diary” of a Pepys or an\r\nEvelyn; at other periods you must be content to find only slender veins\r\nof the ore of familiar observation and intimate knowledge of affairs\r\nfor which you are delving; but your search will seldom be altogether\r\nfutile. Some newly opened archive office may offer _cahiers_, such as\r\nrevealed to de Tocqueville, more than all other records, the _ancien\r\nrégime_. Some elder Hamerton may tell you of the significant things\r\nto be seen ‘round his house.’ All correspondence and autobiography\r\nwill repay perusal, even when not so soaked in affairs as the letters\r\nof Cromwell, or so reminiscent of politics as the “Memoirs of Samuel\r\nRomilly.”\r\n\r\nPolitics is the life of the State, and nothing which illustrates that\r\nlife, nothing which reveals any habit contracted by man as a political\r\nanimal, comes amiss in the study of politics. Public law is the formal\r\nbasis of the political life of society, but it is not always an\r\nexpression of its vital principle. We are inclined, oftentimes, to take\r\nlaws and constitutions too seriously, to put implicit faith in their\r\nprofessions without examining their conduct. Do they affect to advance\r\nliberty, for instance? We ought to go, in person or in imagination,\r\namongst the people whom they command, and see for ourselves whether\r\nthose people enjoy liberty. With reference to laws and constitutions of\r\nour own day, we can learn such things best by supplementing books and\r\nstudy by travel and observation. The best-taught class in modern public\r\nlaw would be a travelling class. Other times than our own we must\r\nperforce be content to see through other men’s eyes.\r\n\r\nIn other words, statute books and legal commentaries are all very well\r\nin the study of politics, if only you quite thoroughly understand that\r\nthey furnish only the crude body-colors for your picture of the State’s\r\nlife, upon which all your finer luminous and atmospheric effects are\r\nafterwards to be worked. It is high time to recognize the fact that\r\npolitics can be effectually expounded only by means of the highest\r\nliterary methods. Only master workers in language and in the grouping\r\nand interpretation of heterogeneous materials can achieve the highest\r\nsuccess in making real _in words_ the complex life of States. If I\r\nmight act as the interpreter of the new-school economists of whom I\r\nhave already spoken, I trust with due reverence, I should say that this\r\nis the thought which, despite their too frequent practical contempt\r\nfor artistic literary form, is possessing them. John Stuart Mill and\r\nRicardo made a sort of logic of political economy; in order to simplify\r\ntheir processes, they deliberately stripped man of all motives save\r\nself-interest alone, and the result was evidently ‘_doctrinaire_’--was\r\nnot a picture of life, but a theorem of trade. Hence “the most dismal\r\nof all sciences;” hence Sidney Smith’s exhortation to his friend not\r\nto touch the hard, unnatural thing. The new-school economists revolt,\r\nand say they want “a more scientific method.” What they really want\r\nis a higher literary method. They want to take account of how a man’s\r\nwife affects his trade, how his children stiffen his prudence, how\r\nhis prejudices condition his enterprise, how his lack of imagination\r\nlimits his market, how strongly love of home holds him back from the\r\ngood wages that might be had by emigration, how despotically the\r\nopinion of his neighbors forbids his insisting upon a cash business,\r\nhow his position in local society prescribes the commodities he is\r\n_not_ to deal in; in brief, how men actually do labor, plan, and get\r\ngain. They are, therefore, portentously busy amassing particulars about\r\nthe occupations, the habits, the earnings, the whole economic life of\r\nall classes and conditions of men. But these things are only the raw\r\nmaterial of poetry and the literary art, and without the intervention\r\nof literary art must remain raw material. To make anything of them, the\r\neconomist must become a literary artist and bring his discoveries home\r\nto our imaginations--make these innumerable details of his pour in a\r\nconcentrated fire upon the central citadels of men’s understandings. A\r\nsingle step or two would then bring him within full sight of the longed\r\nfor time when political economy is to dominate legislation.\r\n\r\nIt has fallen out that, by turning its thoughts toward becoming a\r\nscience, politics, like political economy, has joined its literature\r\nto those books of _natural_ science which boast a brief authority, and\r\nthen make way for what is ‘latest.’ Unless it be of the constitution\r\nof those rare books which mark an epoch in scientific thought, a\r\n‘scientific work’ may not expect to outlive the prevailing fashion in\r\nladies’ wraps. But books on politics are in the wrong company when\r\nthey associate with works among which so high a rate of mortality\r\nobtains. The ‘science’ proper to them, as distinguished from that\r\nwhich is proper to the company they now affect, is a science whose\r\nvery expositions are as deathless as itself. It is the science of the\r\nlife of man in society. Nothing which elucidates that life ought\r\nto be reckoned foreign to its art; and no true picture of that life\r\ncan ever perish out of literature. Ripe scholarship in history and\r\njurisprudence is not more indispensable to the student of politics\r\nthan are a constructive imagination and a poet’s eye for the detail of\r\nhuman incident. The heart of his task is insight and interpretation; no\r\nliterary power that he can bring to bear upon it will be greater than\r\nhe needs. Arthur Young’s way of observing, Bagehot’s way of writing,\r\nand Burke’s way of philosophizing would make an ideal combination for\r\nthe work he has to do. His materials are often of the most illusive\r\nsort, the problems which he has to solve are always of the most\r\nconfounding magnitude and variety.\r\n\r\nIt is easy for him to say, for instance, that the political\r\ninstitutions of one country will not suit another country; but how\r\ninfinitely difficult is it to answer the monosyllables How? and Why? To\r\nreply to the Why he must make out all the contrasts in the histories\r\nof the two countries. But it depends entirely upon what sort of eye he\r\nhas whether those contrasts will contain for him vital causes of the\r\neffect he is seeking to expound. He may let some anecdote escape him\r\nwhich gleams with the very spark needed to kindle his exposition. In\r\nlooking only for grave political facts he may overlook some apparently\r\ntrivial outlying detail which contains the very secret he would guess.\r\nHe may neglect to notice what men are most talked about by the people;\r\nwhose photographs are most frequently to be seen on the walls of\r\npeasant cottages; what books are oftenest on their shelves. Intent\r\nupon intrigue and legislation, he may pass over with only a laugh some\r\npiquant gossip about legislator or courtier without the least suspicion\r\nthat it epitomizes a whole scheme of government. He may admire\r\nself-government so much as to forget that it is a very coarse, homely\r\nthing when alive, and so may really never know anything valuable about\r\nit. The man who thinks the polls disagreeable and uninteresting places\r\nhas no business taking up a pen to write about government. The man who\r\ndespises the sheriff because he is coarse and uncouth, and who studies\r\nthe sheriff’s functions only from the drawing-room or the library,\r\nwill realize the life of government no better than he realizes the\r\nvanity of ‘good form.’\r\n\r\nIf politics were to be studied as a great department of human conduct,\r\nnot to be understood by a scholar who is not also a man of the\r\nworld, its literature might be made as imperishable as that of the\r\nimagination. There might then enter into it that individuality which\r\nis immortality. That personal equation which constitutes the power of\r\nall books which have aught of force in them would then rescue books on\r\npolitics from the dismal category of ‘treatises,’ and exalt them to\r\nthe patriciate of literature. The needed reaction against the still\r\n‘orthodox’ methods of discoursing upon laws and constitutions, like\r\nthat already set afoot against the ‘orthodox’ political economists,\r\nshould be a ‘literary movement’--a movement from formalism to life.\r\nIn order really to know anything about government, you must _see it\r\nalive_; and the object of the writer on politics should be nothing less\r\nthan this, to paint government to the life, to make it live again upon\r\nhis page.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL SOVEREIGNTY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conception of political sovereignty is one of those interesting\r\nportions of doctrine which belong in common to several distinct\r\nbranches of study. No systematic discussion of any part of the science\r\nof politics can advance very far without it; and it is even more\r\nindispensable to the student of legal systems than to the student of\r\npolitics. It is a question central to the life of states and to the\r\nvalidity of law.\r\n\r\nAnd it is rendered the more interesting by the fact that it is a\r\ncritical question, used by all schools alike as a capital test of\r\northodoxy. No man who cares a whit about his standing among students of\r\nlaw or of politics can afford to approach it lightly. Whatever he says\r\nabout it he must needs say with a profound sense of responsibility. He\r\nmust undertake the discussion of it with the same sort of gravity,\r\nwith the same deep sense of personal risk, that the political economist\r\nevinces when he ventures an opinion about Value or hazards a theory\r\nof Distribution. When once he has committed himself to an opinion\r\nconcerning it, he may be sure that with a large and influential number\r\nof his fellow-students he can never thereafter pass for a man of\r\nundoubted scholarship or unclouded sense.\r\n\r\nIf it is awkward, under such circumstances, that the conception should\r\nbe so indispensable, it doubtless has the advantage of forcing boldness\r\nupon us. If for nothing else than for the sake of a _modus vivendi_, we\r\nmust out with whatever notion it is that we have accepted or invented\r\nwith reference to the nature and lodgement of sovereignty. It is, on\r\nthe whole, safer to be explicit than to hedge.\r\n\r\nAnd yet it is not easy to be explicit; for there are no suitable terms\r\nto be explicit with. One no sooner begins to examine the field and\r\nthe matter of controversy than he begins to suspect that it is all a\r\nquestion of terminology. After being hurried in bewilderment through\r\none of Browning’s short poems without being permitted to be quite sure\r\nat any point of the full meaning, we are led in our disappointment\r\nto wonder, with Mr. Birrell, if it can be the punctuation. In what\r\nwe read of sovereignty we are led to wonder if it can be the _words_\r\nthat confuse us. It must be evident to every one who has not been\r\nsophisticated by the terms themselves, or committed beyond retrieval by\r\nthe controversial use of them, that when, for example, the people of\r\nthe United States and the Czar of Russia are put together in the same\r\nclass as sovereigns, language has been forced to a very artificial use,\r\nand one term made to cover radically different things. There is clearly\r\na striking contrast between these two sovereigns, in character, in\r\nmethod, and in power. Doubtless an excellent way by which to enter our\r\nsubject would be through an examination of this difference. But another\r\nway is more direct.\r\n\r\nLet us begin with an accepted definition of sovereignty. It is\r\nboth decent and convenient to take that of Austin, that celebrated\r\ndefinition which he received through Bentham from Hobbes. Austin\r\nconceived a sovereign very concretely, as a person or body of persons\r\nexisting in an independent political society and accorded the habitual\r\nobedience of the bulk of the members of that society, while itself\r\nsubordinate to no political superior. Law he defined to be the explicit\r\nor implicit command of such a person or body of persons, addressed to\r\nthe members of the community, its inferiors or subjects. He took it for\r\ngranted that in every independent community supreme political authority\r\ndid actually vest in some such determinate sovereign person or body of\r\npersons.\r\n\r\nBy the very term used to describe it, moreover, this sovereignty\r\nis supremacy--is subject to no limitation. Every law is a command,\r\nnot only, but the command of a supreme authority; and it would be a\r\nsingular contradiction in terms to speak of this supreme power as\r\nlimited by law. How can the supreme author of law within a state\r\nhimself be subject to law: how can the creature bind the creator?\r\nHow can one refrain from smiling at the logical incapacity of those\r\nwho speak of limitations to sovereignty, or, more absurdly still, of\r\ndivisions of sovereignty? Is there a hierarchy of supremacies: can\r\nthere be a co-ordination of creators?\r\n\r\nAustin had studied in Bonn while it was the residence of such men as\r\nNiebuhr, Schlegel, Arndt, Welcher, Mackeldey, and Heffter, and at a\r\nperiod when controversy touching some of the fundamental questions\r\nconcerning the province and method of jurisprudence was in its keen\r\nyouth. His thought was mature, indeed, before he went abroad, and\r\nnature had very imperatively commanded of what sort that thought\r\nshould be by giving him a mind framed for abstract conception and\r\nsharp logical processes; but contact with German thinking contributed\r\nmany important elements to his mental equipment. Thibaut became\r\nscarcely less his master than Bentham. It was inevitable that it\r\nshould be Thibaut rather than Savigny. Savigny believed that all\r\nlaw was rooted in old habit, and that legislation could modify law\r\nsuccessfully and beneficially only by consenting to the secondary\r\n_rôle_ of supplementing, formulating, or at most guiding custom. He\r\nwas at weapons drawn with the school of Thibaut, which proposed to\r\nlay legislative hands on the entire body of German law, make a code\r\nwhich should be common to all the German States, and so help to make\r\nGermany a national unit. To attempt thus to systematize law, where by\r\nnatural development it was unsystematic, seemed to Savigny a deliberate\r\neffort to render it artificial. Law, he maintained, did not often\r\ngrow into a logical system, but was the product of daily accretions\r\nof habit and sluggish formations of thought, which followed no system\r\nof philosophy. It was not the business of legal science to force it\r\ninto logical categories; it was its function, rather, to give a clear\r\nexplanation of the principles and order of its life and a satisfactory\r\nworking analysis of its several parts and conceptions. Thibaut, on the\r\nother hand, believed it to be the legitimate function of the jurist to\r\nmake piecemeal law up into organic wholes, rendering it clear where it\r\nhad been obscure, correcting its inconsistencies, trimming away its\r\nirregularities, reducing the number of its exceptional provisions,\r\ndiscovering and filling in its gaps, running it through with threads\r\nof system, giving it elegance of style and completeness of method.\r\nHe thought it possible to change law from a system of habits into a\r\nsystem of commands. These were, of course, the ideas which were most\r\nattractive, most congenial, to the mind of Austin.\r\n\r\nBut, however natural such conceptions may have been to Austin, it\r\nmust certainly be regarded as singular that, although rejected on\r\nthe Continent, where sovereignty had throughout the most important\r\nformative periods of European history been quite unequivocally lodged\r\nin unmistakable sovereigns, these notions should have been accepted in\r\nEngland, the land where law had been least subject to doctrine, most\r\nobservant of times and circumstances, most piecemeal in its manner of\r\nconstruction, least like a set of commands, and most like a set of\r\nhabits and conventions. Doubtless we are to remember, however, that\r\nthe feudal theory of law had long been held with perfect confidence by\r\nEnglish lawyers in calm despite of fact. Probably it is true that the\r\nEnglish mind (our own), with its practical habit, likes nice systems\r\nwell enough because of their appearance of completeness, has a sense of\r\norder which enjoys logic, without having any curiosity or capacity for\r\nthe examination of premises. The Englishman has always been found ready\r\nto accept, from those who had the leisure to amuse themselves in that\r\nway, interesting explanations of his institutions which did not at all\r\nfit the actual facts. It has caused him no inconvenience, for he has\r\nnot perceived the lack of adjustment between his actual transactions\r\nand the theory he has accepted concerning them. He has, of course, not\r\ntroubled himself to alter his institutions to suit his philosophy. That\r\nphilosophy satisfied his thought and inconvenienced neither Parliament\r\nnor the law courts. And so he had no doubt Austin was right.\r\n\r\nAustin’s logic is unrelenting, and the loyalty of his followers\r\nunflinching. Sir Henry Maine having shown that throughout the greater\r\npart of history the world has been full of independent political\r\nsocieties possessing no law-making sovereign at all, and it having\r\nbecome notorious that legislation has everywhere played a late and\r\ncomparatively subordinate part in the production of law, the latest\r\nwriters of the Austinian school have reduced jurisprudence to a merely\r\nformal science, professing to care nothing for the actual manner in\r\nwhich law may originate, nothing even for most of the motives which\r\ninduce men to obey law, provided you will but concede that there is,\r\namong a great many other imperative motives, one which is universally\r\noperative, namely, the fear of the compulsion of physical force, and\r\nthat there is at least one sovereign function, namely, the application\r\nof that physical force in the carrying out of the law. They ask to be\r\nallowed to confine themselves to such a definition of positive law as\r\nwill limit it to “rules which are _enforced_ by a political superior in\r\nhis capacity as such.” They take for their province only a systematic\r\ndescription of the forms and method “of the influence of government\r\nupon human conduct” through the operation of law. They thus virtually\r\nabandon the attempt to find any universal doctrines respecting the\r\n_rôle_ of government as a _maker_ of laws. For them government is not\r\na creative agent, but only an instrumentality for the effectuation of\r\nlegal rules already in existence. So hard is the principle of life\r\nto get at that they give over all attempts to find it, and, turning\r\naway from the larger topics of the biology, restrict themselves to the\r\nmorphology, of law.\r\n\r\nWhen it came to pointing out the body of persons with which sovereignty\r\nwas lodged in particular states of complex constitutional structure,\r\nAustin was sometimes very unsatisfactory. Sovereignty is lodged in\r\nEngland, he says, in the king, the peers, and--_not_ the House of\r\nCommons, but--the electorate. For he holds the House of Commons to be\r\nmerely a trustee of the electors, notwithstanding the fact that the\r\nelectors exercise their right of franchise under laws which Parliament\r\nitself enacted and may change. In the United States he “believes” it to\r\nbe lodged “in the States’ governments, as forming an aggregate body;”\r\nand he explains that by the government of a State he does not mean its\r\n“ordinary legislature, but the body of its citizens which appoints\r\nits ordinary legislature, and which, the Union apart, is properly\r\nsovereign therein.” Apparently he is led thus to go back of the House\r\nof Commons and the legislatures of our States to the electorates by\r\nwhich they are chosen, because of his conception of sovereignty as\r\n_unlimited_. If he stopped short of the electors, some part of his\r\nsovereign body would be subject to political superiors. If he were to\r\ngo beyond the electors, to the larger body of the people--to the women\r\nand the children and the men who cannot vote--he would come upon, not a\r\n“determinate,” but an indeterminate body of persons.\r\n\r\nOur own writers, however, having made bold to embrace the dogma of\r\npopular sovereignty with a certain fervor of patriotism, have no\r\nhesitation about taking the additional step. They maintain, with\r\nLieber, that “according to the views of free men,” sovereignty “can\r\ndwell with society, the nation, only.” Writers like the late Judge\r\nJameson, of Chicago, declare that they have very definite ideas of what\r\nthis means. They think that Mr. Bryce expounded the doctrine when he\r\nwrote his chapter on “Government by Public Opinion.” “When the true\r\nsovereign has spoken,” says Judge Jameson, “at public meetings, by the\r\npress, or by personal argument or solicitation, the electorate, when\r\nit acts, either registers the behests of the people or ceases betimes\r\nfurther to represent them.” “The pressure of public opinion consciously\r\nbrought to bear upon the electorate,” he declares to be, even when\r\n“inarticulate” (whatever inarticulate pressure may be), “a clear and\r\nlegitimate exercise of sovereign power;” and he thinks that Mr. Herbert\r\nSpencer meant the same thing when he declared that “that which, from\r\nhour to hour, in every country, governed despotically or otherwise,\r\nproduces the obedience making political action possible, is the\r\naccumulated and organized sentiment felt towards inherited institutions\r\nmade sacred by tradition,” inasmuch as Mr. Spencer proceeds to say\r\nwith all plainness, “Hence it is undeniable that, taken in its widest\r\nacceptation, the feeling of the community is the sole source of\r\npolitical power; in those communities, at least, which are not under\r\nforeign domination. It is so at the outset of social life, and it still\r\ncontinues substantially so.” And yet, if Mr. Spencer means the same\r\nthing that Judge Jameson means, what are we to think of the present\r\nfraternization of France and Russia? If the people be sovereign\r\nin France and the Czar sovereign in Russia, it is doubtless quite\r\nconceivable that one sovereign should love another; but if it be true,\r\nas Judge Jameson makes Mr. Spencer say, that it is the people, even\r\nin Russia, who are after all sovereign, what are we to think of the\r\nfondness of the French sovereign for a government which is holding the\r\nRussian sovereign in subjection? If this be correct thinking, it puts\r\nus into awkward quandaries, troubling our logic as well as condemning\r\nour lives.\r\n\r\nApply this doctrine of our masters in American law to our actual\r\npolitical conditions, and see how far it simplifies the matter.\r\nIn the United States (so runs the orthodox creed) the People is\r\nsovereign.--the verb is singular because the people, under this\r\ndoctrine, constitute a unit. And yet it is notorious that they never\r\nhave acted as a unit, nor ever can act as a unit under our existing\r\nconstitution. They have always acted, and must always act, in state\r\ngroups. And in state groups what action do they take? They assent to\r\nconstitutional provisions, or refuse to assent to them; and they\r\nselect certain persons to act as law-makers, as judges, or as executive\r\nofficers of government. Do they choose policies? No. Do they frame\r\nconstitutional provisions? Certainly not; they only accept or reject\r\nthem. In the only case in which they speak directly concerning specific\r\nprovisions of law, they neither command nor originate. They receive\r\nor decline what is offered them. They must wait until they are asked.\r\nThey have neither initiative nor opportunity to construct. They must be\r\nconsulted concerning government, but they do not conduct it.\r\n\r\nNor is it otherwise, upon last analysis, in Switzerland, where the\r\n_Referendum_ exists, where, that is, the people vote upon specific\r\nmeasures of ordinary legislation not only, but where they are also\r\nprovided with means of imperative initiative in legislation. By\r\npetitions bearing a certain large number of signatures they can propose\r\ndefinite legislation, compel action upon the matter of their petitions\r\nby their legislatures, and an ultimate submission of the question to\r\npopular vote. But see what this is, when examined. The eyes of the\r\ncommunity, the men of observation and progress, get up a petition;\r\nthat is, an indeterminate body and a minority demand that certain laws\r\nbe formulated and put to the vote. The thing is done, but the measure\r\ndefeated, let us suppose, at the polls. The eyes of the community have\r\ndesired certain things, have offered them to the slow digestive organs,\r\nand they have been rejected. Are the digestive organs, then, sovereign,\r\nand not the initiative parts, the eyes and the reason? Is it sovereign\r\nto stomach a thing, and not sovereign to purpose a thing?\r\n\r\nBut turn the chase in another direction, if peradventure we may yet run\r\nthe sovereign people to cover. The more absolute democratic theorists\r\ndecline to restrict the sovereign body to the electorate, to those who\r\nhave formal votes. Voters are simply the agents of the community, they\r\nsay. The press and the pulpit, the private argument and the curtain\r\nlecture, command--voters, if they are faithful, obey. Others, no less\r\ndemocratic, but more precise, seek for a more determinate body, content\r\nthemselves with the qualified voters, and think with relief that all\r\ndifficulties are removed. The electorate is sovereign.\r\n\r\nBut is the electorate a more determinate body than the population?\r\nDoes registration afford us any more certain results than the census\r\nyields? Do the electors act in determinate numbers? Is there a quorum?\r\nHave they any choice but to act under the forms and within the limits\r\nassigned by law? Can they command without invitation, or assent without\r\nsuggestion? Are not the agencies which Judge Jameson calls sovereign\r\nafter all more active, more self-directed, freer to criticise, to\r\nsuggest, to insist? The newspapers, the clergymen, the mass-meeting\r\norators, the urgent friends, the restless, ambitious wives, the pert\r\nand forward children can at any rate keep on talking in the intervals,\r\nwhen the electors are reduced to silence, patiently awaiting an\r\nopportunity to vote. Certainly, if we can accept this miscellaneous\r\nsovereign of men-women-and-children, the history of sovereignty is much\r\nsimplified. This determinate body of persons, the free population, is\r\nalways present, and always has been present, under all constitutions.\r\nAll that we have to inquire is, What means had they for expressing\r\ntheir will? How were their dispositions and judgments made to tell upon\r\nthe consciousness of those who framed the laws? True, this sovereign\r\nbody has its points of resemblance to the god Baal. Those who call upon\r\nit call in vain, if it be not the season appointed for voting; there is\r\nno voice, nor any that answer, nor any that regardeth. No fire consumes\r\nthe sacrifice. Perhaps the People is talking, or is pursuing, or is in\r\na journey, or peradventure it sleepeth, and must be awaked.\r\n\r\nSurely this is a singular undertaking, this mad pursuit of a sovereign\r\namidst the obvious phenomena of politics! If laws be indeed commands,\r\nthe commands of a determinate person or body of persons, it ought to\r\nbe possible to discover this determinate source of authority without\r\nmuch curious research. And yet it would seem that it demands ingenious\r\nanalysis. Look how uneasily Mr. Sidgwick casts about in the last\r\nchapter of his recent “Elements of Politics,” to find Supreme Political\r\nPower--which is his name for sovereignty. He has been looking forward\r\nto this inquiry, not without nervousness, throughout the chapters which\r\nprecede. Political power is exercised, he perceives, through some organ\r\nof government; but he cannot conceive that the power of this organ\r\nis its own power. He engages in a study of dynamics. What moves this\r\norgan: whence does it derive its power? How is it influenced? Is it\r\nitself commanded, overawed, constrained from any quarter? This is a\r\ndoor to the metaphysics of government. Taking a prince as a simple and\r\nnormal organ of government, he analyzes the subjection of princes to\r\ntheir ministers, to priests, to mistresses, to the violent protests\r\nof an insubordinate people. No influence that the prince can throw\r\noff without losing his own authority, he thinks, can be a sovereign\r\ninfluence; but any influence which can threaten his power if he resists\r\nis a sovereign influence, the true depository of supreme political\r\npower. Sovereignty thus becomes a catalogue of influences.\r\n\r\nCan we accept these singular processes? If a physicist were to discard\r\nall the separate laws, all the differential analysis of his science,\r\nand were to reduce its entire body of principles to some general\r\nstatement of the correlation of forces, he would hardly be conceived to\r\nhave done physics a service. If in our study of anatomy we should turn\r\naway from structural adjustment and functional force to take account\r\nof the thousand and one influences which in individual cases affect\r\nthe organs from without, we should obviously be abandoning the science\r\nitself. It seems to me that we do a very like thing if, in studying\r\nthe structural forces and organic actions of society, its organs of\r\norigination and command, its organs of execution, its superior and\r\nits subordinate authorities, its habitual modes of structural life,\r\nwe abandon all attempts at differentiation, throw all analysis into\r\nhotch-potch, and reduce everything to terms of the general forces\r\nwhich mould and govern society as a whole. We confuse our thought\r\nin our effort to simplify it. We lose, we do not gain, by putting\r\npowers of radically different sorts together into the same categories,\r\nand driving them abreast, as if they pulled together, in the same\r\npropositions.\r\n\r\nThere is no unlimited power, except the sum of all powers. Our legal\r\ntheorists have sought unlimited sovereignty by a process of summation;\r\nhave made it consist in the combined forces of the community.\r\nSovereignty, if it be a definite and separable thing at all, is not\r\nunlimited power; is not identical with the powers of the community.\r\nIt is not the general vitality of the organism, but the specific\r\noriginative power of certain organs. Sovereigns have always been\r\nsubject in greater or less degree to the community; have always been\r\norgans of the State; have never been the State itself. But they have\r\nbeen sovereigns none the less; they, and not the community over which\r\nthey presided.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary, if there is to be any clear thinking at all upon this\r\nsubject, to distinguish very sharply two radically different things;\r\nnamely, the powers and processes of governing, on the one hand, from\r\nthe relations of the people to those powers and processes, on the\r\nother. Those relations are relations of assent and obedience; and the\r\ndegree of assent and obedience marks in every case the limits, that\r\nis, the sphere, of sovereignty. Sovereignty is the daily operative\r\npower of framing and giving efficacy to laws. It is the originative,\r\ndirective, governing power. It lives; it plans; it executes. It is\r\nthe organic origination by the State of its law and policy; and the\r\nsovereign power is the highest originative organ of the State. It is\r\nnone the less sovereign because it must be observant of the preferences\r\nof those whom it governs. The obedience of the subject has always\r\nlimited the power of the sovereign. “The Eastern politicians never do\r\nanything,” says Burke, “without the opinion of the astrologers on the\r\nfortunate moment.... Statesmen of a more judicious prescience look for\r\nthe fortunate moment too; but they seek it, not in the conjunctions\r\nand oppositions of planets, but in the conjunctions and oppositions\r\nof men and things.” This is the covert admission of the Austinian\r\ndefinition itself: the sovereign power is that to which “the bulk of\r\nthe community _is habitually obedient_.” When we discuss, with Mr.\r\nSidgwick, the influences which tell upon the action of the originative\r\norgans of the State, we are not discussing sovereignty, but the\r\nnatural and universal limitations of sovereignty, the structural checks\r\nand balances of the organism. There is no hope for theory if we neglect\r\nthese obvious distinctions.\r\n\r\nAt all times and under all systems there have been two sets of\r\nphenomena visible in government: the phenomena of command and the\r\nphenomena of obedience, the phenomena of governing and the phenomena\r\nof being governed. Obedience, moreover, is not always an automatic or\r\nunconscious thing. It is a submission of the will--an acquiescence\r\nwhich is either the product of choice, of necessity, or of habit. This\r\nhas been observed from the first; was observed by Bodin, from whom we\r\nget our word sovereignty, and much of our conception of the thing,\r\nsovereignty. He perceived that the supremacy of the sovereign--even of\r\nthe mediæval French sovereign before his eyes--was in fact limited, the\r\nfrontiers of sovereignty being marked by certain antecedent rights, by\r\ndivers established prerogatives of property and vested privilege--not a\r\nscientific, but a natural frontier, lying along the old mountains of\r\nhabit, the well-known rivers of precedent.\r\n\r\nWe know that the history of politics has been the history of liberty;\r\na history of the enlargement of the sphere of independent individual\r\naction at the expense of the sphere of dictatorial authority. It has\r\nrevealed a process of differentiation. Certain freedoms of opinion\r\nand utterance, of choice of occupation and of allegiance, of fair\r\ntrial and equitable condemnation, have been blocked out as inviolable\r\nterritories, lying quite beyond the jurisdiction of political\r\nsovereignty. Beginning with that singular and interesting order of\r\nthe classical states of the ancient world, under which the individual\r\nwas merged in the community and liberty became identical with a share\r\nin the exercise of the public power, we witness something like a\r\ngradual disintegration, a resolution of the State into its constituent\r\nelements, until at length those who govern and those who are governed\r\nare no longer one and the same, but stand face to face treating with\r\none another, agreeing upon terms of command and obedience, as at\r\nRunnymede. Conditions of submission have been contested, and, as\r\nliberty has gained upon authority, have been jealously formulated. The\r\nprocedure and the prerogatives of authority have been agreed upon;\r\nliberty has encroached upon sovereignty and set bounds to it. The\r\nprocess is old; only some of its results are new. What both political\r\nphilosophers and political revolutionists have sought for time out\r\nof mind has been a final definition for that part of the Austinian\r\nconception which concerns the _habitual obedience_ of the community.\r\nThese definitions, in their practical shape as institutions, we now\r\ncall constitutions. At last peoples have become conscious of their\r\nrelations to the highest powers of the State, and have sought to give\r\npermanence and certainty to those relations by setting the conditions\r\nof their subordination fast in stubborn practices or in the solemn\r\ncovenants of written documents. A constitution government has always\r\nhad; but not until this latest age these deliberate formulations of\r\nprinciple and practice which determine the whole organization and\r\naction of the State, the domain of authority, the neutral territory of\r\nliberty, the postulates of obedience.\r\n\r\nConstitutions are definitive rather than creative. They sum up\r\nexperiences. They register consents. Assuredly Mr. Spencer is right\r\nwhen he declares that that which in every country, under whatever\r\nsystem governed, “produces the obedience making political action\r\npossible, is the accumulated and organized sentiment of the community\r\ntowards inherited institutions,” and that “the feeling of the community\r\nis the sole source of political power.” But this does not mean what\r\nJudge Jameson reads into it, that sovereignty and the feeling of\r\nthe community are one and the same thing; that the conditions of\r\nsovereignty and the exercise of sovereignty are identical. Sovereignty\r\nhas at all times and under all systems of government been dependent\r\nupon the temper and disposition of the people. The will of the\r\ncommunity, the inclinations and desires of the body politic as a whole,\r\nare always, in the last analysis, the foundation, as they are also\r\nin many instances the direct and immediate source, of law. But these\r\npreferences of the general body are exercised by way of approval or\r\ndisapproval, acquiescence or resistance; they are not agencies of\r\ninitial choice. The sanctioning judgments of a people are passive,\r\ndormant, waiting to have things put to them, unable themselves to\r\nsuggest anything, because without organs of utterance or suggestion. I\r\ncannot predicate sovereignty of my physical parts, but must ascribe it\r\nto my will, notwithstanding the fact that my physical parts must assent\r\nto the purposes of my will, and that my will is dependent upon their\r\nobedience. The organism unquestionably dominates the organs; but there\r\nare organs, nevertheless, organs of origination, which direct and rule\r\nwith a sovereign presidency.\r\n\r\nA written constitution adopted by popular vote affords, perhaps, some\r\nof the nicest tests of theory. Here we have the most specific form\r\nof popular assent. In such a document the powers of the government\r\nare explicitly set forth and specifically lodged; and the means by\r\nwhich they may be differently constituted or bestowed are definitively\r\ndetermined. Now we know that these documents are the result of\r\nexperience, the outcome of a contest of forces, the fruits of struggle.\r\nNations have taken knowledge of despotism. They have seen authority\r\nabused and have refused to submit; have perceived justice to be\r\narbitrary and hidden away in secret tribunals, and have insisted\r\nthat it be made uniform and open; have seen ministers chosen from\r\namong favorites, and have demanded that they be taken from among\r\nrepresentatives of the people; have found legislation regardful of\r\nclasses, and have clamored to have laws made by men selected without\r\nregard to class; have felt obedience irksome because government was\r\ndisordered in form and confused in respect of responsibility, and have\r\ninsisted that responsibility be fixed and forms of order and publicity\r\nobserved. Sometimes only a steady practice has accomplished all this;\r\nsometimes documentary securities have been demanded. These documentary\r\nsecurities are written constitutions.\r\n\r\nIt is easy, as it is also impressive, to believe that a written\r\nconstitution proceeds from the people, and constitutes their sovereign\r\nbehest concerning government. But of course it does not. It proceeds\r\nalways either from some ordinary or from some extraordinary organ of\r\nthe state; its provisions are the fruit of the debated determinations\r\nof a comparatively small deliberative body, acting usually under\r\nsome form of legal commission. It is accepted as a whole and without\r\ndiscrimination by the diffused, undeliberative body of voters.\r\n\r\nWhat confuses our view is the fact that these formal documentary\r\nstatements of the kinds and degrees of obedience to which the people\r\nassent, the methods of power to which they submit, the sort of\r\nresponsibility upon which they insist, have become, from the very\r\nnecessity of their nature, a distinct and superior sort of precise and\r\npositive law. We seek the sovereign who utters them. But they are not\r\nthe utterances of a sovereign. They are the covenants of a community.\r\nTime out of mind communities have made covenants with their sovereigns.\r\nWhen despotism in France was ‘tempered by epigram,’ the sharp tongues\r\nof the wits spoke, after a sort, the constitution of the country,--a\r\npositive law whose sanction was ridicule. But the wits were not\r\nsovereign; the _salons_ did not conduct government. Our written\r\nconstitutions are only very formal statements of the standards to which\r\nthe people, upon whom government depends for support, will hold those\r\nwho exercise the sovereign power.\r\n\r\nI do not, of course, deny the power of the people. Ultimately they\r\ncondition the action of those who govern; and it is salutary that it\r\nshould be so. It is wise also, if it be not indispensable, that the\r\nextent and manner of their control should be explicitly set forth\r\nand definitively agreed upon in documents of unmistakable tenor. I\r\nsay simply that such control is no new thing. It is only the precise\r\nformulation of it that is new.\r\n\r\nIf it seem to be after all a question of words, a little closer\r\nscrutiny will disclose the fact that it is much more than that. Mr.\r\nRitchie, of Oxford University, in an able article on “The Conception\r\nof Sovereignty,” contributed to the _Annals of the American Academy of\r\nPolitical and Social Science_ (January, 1891), perceiving some part\r\nof the distinction that I have pointed out, and wishing to realize\r\nit in his thought, proposes to distinguish three several kinds of\r\nsovereigns: viz. a nominal sovereign--the English queen, for example;\r\na legal sovereign--the law-making body; and a political sovereign--the\r\nvoters, whom we might call the sovereign of appeal. But why not confine\r\nourselves to substantives, if we may, and avoid the quicksands of\r\nadjectives? Sovereignty is something quite definite; so also is power;\r\nso also is control. Sovereignty is the highest political power in\r\nthe state, lodged in active organs, for the purposes of governing.\r\nSovereign power is a positive thing; control a negative thing. Power\r\nbelongs to government, is lodged in organs of initiative; control\r\nbelongs to the community, is lodged with the voters. To call these two\r\nthings by the same name is simply to impoverish language by making one\r\nword serve for a variety of meanings.\r\n\r\nIt is never easy to point out in our complex modern governments the\r\nexact organs in which sovereignty is lodged. On the whole, however, it\r\nis always safe to ascribe sovereignty to the highest originative or\r\nlaw-making body of the state,--the body by whose determinations both\r\nthe tasks to be carried out by the Administration and the rules to be\r\napplied by the courts are fixed and warranted. Even where the courts\r\nutter authoritative interpretations of what we call the fundamental\r\nlaw--the law that is embodied in constitutions--they are rather the\r\norgans through which the limitations of sovereignty are determined\r\nthan organs of sovereignty itself. They declare the principles of that\r\nhigher, constituent law which is set above sovereignty, which expresses\r\nthe restrictions set about the exercise of sovereign authority.\r\nSuch restrictions exist in all states, but they are given definite\r\nformulation only in some. As for the Executive, that is the agent, not\r\nthe organ, of sovereignty.\r\n\r\nBut, even if it be comparatively easy thus to fix upon the organs of\r\nsovereignty in a unitary state, what shall we say of a federal state?\r\nHow apply our analysis to that? One is tempted to declare, with Dr.\r\nMerkel, of Strassburg, that federal states give direct contradiction\r\nof fact to prevailing theories respecting the necessity for unity\r\nof power, indivisibility of sovereignty. Here, as he says, we have\r\norgans and authorities in possession of powers exclusively their own,\r\nfor the furtherance of functions necessary to the ends of the state\r\nas a whole, existing side by side with organs also in full possession\r\nof powers exclusively their own, for the furtherance of the local\r\nand special functions of the member states. We know, moreover, that\r\nthese two sets of organs are in fact co-ordinate; that the powers of\r\nthe states were not derived from the federal authority, were even\r\nantecedent to the powers of the federal government, and historically\r\nquite independent of them. And yet no one who ponders either the life\r\nor the formal structure of a federal state can fail to perceive that\r\nthere is, after all, an essential unity in it, the virtual creation of\r\na central sovereignty. The constituent act--the manner in which the\r\ngovernment was created--can, I conceive, have nothing to do with our\r\nanalysis in this matter. The way in which the federal state came into\r\nexistence is immaterial to the question of sovereignty within it after\r\nit has been created. Originative life and action, the characteristic\r\nattributes of sovereignty, come after that. Character and choice are\r\npostponed to birth, sovereignty to the creation of the body politic.\r\nThe constituent act creates a thing capable of exercising sovereignty.\r\nAfter the creative law has done its part, by whatever process, then the\r\nfunctions of independent life begin. Thereafter, in all federal states,\r\neven the amendment of the fundamental law becomes an organic act,\r\ndepending, practically without exception, upon the initiative of the\r\nchief originative organ of the federal state. Confederations are here\r\nout of the question. They are, of course, associations of sovereigns.\r\nIn the federal state self-determination with respect to their law as\r\na whole has been lost by the member states. They cannot extend, they\r\ncannot even determine, their own powers conclusively without appeal to\r\nthe federal authorities. They are unquestionably subject to a political\r\nsuperior. They are fused, subordinated, dominated. Though they do not\r\nexercise their powers by virtue of delegation, though their powers are\r\nindeed inherent and in a very important sense independent, they are\r\nyet inferior to a body whose own powers are in reality self-determined,\r\nhowever much that self-determination may be hedged about and clogged\r\nby the forms of the fundamental federal law. They are still states,\r\nbecause their powers are original and inherent, not derivative; because\r\ntheir political rights are not also legal duties; and because they\r\ncan apply to their commands the full imperative sanctions of law.\r\nBut their sphere is limited by the presiding and sovereign powers\r\nof a state superordinated to them, the extent of whose authority is\r\ndetermined, under constitutional forms and guarantees, by itself. They\r\nhave dominion; but it has sovereignty. For with the federal state lie\r\nthe highest powers of originative legal determination, the ultimate\r\nauthority to warrant change and sanction jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nOur thought is embarrassed throughout such an analysis by the very\r\nfact which invalidates the Austinian conception and makes a fresh\r\nanalysis necessary. Very little law literally originates in command,\r\nthough its formulation and enforcement must unquestionably be effected\r\nthrough the commanding authorities of the state. It is their function\r\nto direct, to lead, rather than to command. They originate forms,\r\nbut they do not discover principles. In a very profound sense law\r\nproceeds from the community. It is the result of its undeliberate\r\nas well as of its deliberate developments, of its struggles, class\r\nagainst class, interest against interest, and of its compromises and\r\nadjustments of opinion. It follows, slowly, its ethical judgments, more\r\npromptly its material necessities. But law issues thus from the body\r\nof the community only in vague and inchoate form. It must be taken\r\nout of the sphere of voluntary and uncertain action and made precise\r\nand invariable. It becomes positive law by receiving definition and\r\nbeing backed by an active and recognized power within the state. The\r\nsovereign organ of a state is, therefore, very properly said to be\r\nits law-_making_ organ. It transmutes selected tendencies into stiff\r\nand urgent rules. It exercises a sovereign choice in so doing. It\r\ndetermines which tendencies shall be accepted, which checked and denied\r\nefficacy. It forms the purposes of the state, avoiding revolution if\r\nit form them wisely and with a true insight. This is sovereignty:--to\r\nsit at the helm and steer, marking out such free courses for the\r\nstanch craft as wind and weather will permit. This is the only sort of\r\nsovereignty that can be exercised in human affairs. But the pilot is\r\nsovereign, and not the weather.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nCHARACTER OF DEMOCRACY IN THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\n\r\nEverything apprises us of the fact that we are not the same nation\r\nnow that we were when the government was formed. In looking back to\r\nthat time, the impression is inevitable that we started with sundry\r\nwrong ideas about ourselves. We deemed ourselves rank democrats,\r\nwhereas we were in fact only progressive Englishmen. Turn the leaves\r\nof that sage manual of constitutional interpretation and advocacy, the\r\n_Federalist_, and note the perverse tendency of its writers to refer\r\nto Greece and Rome for precedents,--that Greece and Rome which haunted\r\nall our earlier and even some of our more mature years. Recall, too,\r\nthat familiar story of Daniel Webster which tells of his coming home\r\nexhausted from an interview with the first President-elect Harrison,\r\nwhose Secretary of State he was to be, and explaining that he had been\r\nobliged in the course of the conference, which concerned the inaugural\r\naddress about to be delivered, to kill nine Roman consuls whom it had\r\nbeen the intention of the good conqueror of Tippecanoe publicly to take\r\ninto office with him. The truth is that we long imagined ourselves\r\nrelated in some unexplained way to all ancient republicans. Strangely\r\nenough, too, we at the same time accepted the quite incompatible theory\r\nthat we were related also to the French philosophical radicals. We\r\nclaimed kinship with democrats everywhere,--with all democrats. We can\r\nnow scarcely realize the atmosphere of such thoughts. We are no longer\r\nwont to refer to the ancients or to the French for sanction of what we\r\ndo. We have had abundant experience of our own by which to reckon.\r\n\r\n“Hardly any fact in history,” says Mr. Bagehot, writing about the\r\nmiddle of the century, “is so incredible as that forty and a few\r\nyears ago England was ruled by Mr. Perceval. It seems almost the same\r\nas being ruled by the _Record_ newspaper.” (Mr. Bagehot would now\r\nprobably say the _Standard_ newspaper.) “He had the same poorness\r\nof thought, the same petty conservatism, the same dark and narrow\r\nsuperstition.” “The mere fact of such a premier being endured shows\r\nhow deeply the whole national spirit and interest was absorbed in the\r\ncontest with Napoleon, how little we understood the sort of man who\r\nshould regulate its conduct,--‘in the crisis of Europe,’ as Sydney\r\nSmith said, ‘he safely brought the Curates’ Salaries Improvement Bill\r\nto a hearing;’ and it still more shows the horror of all innovation\r\nwhich the recent events of French history had impressed on our wealthy\r\nand comfortable classes. They were afraid of catching revolution, as\r\nold women of catching cold. Sir Archibald Alison to this day holds that\r\nrevolution is an infectious disease, beginning no one knows how, and\r\ngoing on no one knows where. There is but one rule of escape, explains\r\nthe great historian: ‘Stay still; don’t move; do what you have been\r\naccustomed to do; and consult your grandmother on everything.’”\r\n\r\nAlmost equally incredible to us is the ardor of revolution that filled\r\nthe world in those first days of our national life,--the fact that one\r\nof the rulers of the world’s mind in that generation was Rousseau, the\r\napostle of all that is fanciful, unreal, and misleading in politics.\r\nTo be ruled by him was like taking an account of life from Mr. Rider\r\nHaggard. And yet there is still much sympathy in this timid world\r\nfor the dull people who felt safe in the hands of Mr. Perceval, and,\r\nhappily, much sympathy also, though little justification, for such as\r\ncaught a generous elevation of spirit from the speculative enthusiasm\r\nof Rousseau.\r\n\r\nFor us who stand in the dusty matter-of-fact world of to-day, there\r\nis a touch of pathos in recollections of the ardor for democratic\r\nliberty that filled the air of Europe and America a century ago with\r\nsuch quickening influences. We may sometimes catch ourselves regretting\r\nthat the inoculations of experience have closed our systems against the\r\ninfections of hopeful revolution.\r\n\r\n    “Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive,\r\n    But to be young was very heaven! O times\r\n    In which the meagre, stale, forbidding ways\r\n    Of custom, law, and statute took at once\r\n    The attraction of a country in romance!\r\n    When Reason seemed the most to assert her rights,\r\n    When most intent on making of herself\r\n    A prime Enchantress, to assist the work\r\n    Which then was going forward in her name!\r\n    Not favored spots alone, but the whole earth,\r\n    The beauty wore of promise, that which sets\r\n    (As at some moment might not be unfelt\r\n    Among the bowers of paradise itself)\r\n    The budding rose above the rose full blown.”\r\n\r\nSuch was the inspiration which not Wordsworth alone, but Coleridge\r\nalso, and many another generous spirit whom we love, caught in that day\r\nof hope.\r\n\r\nIt is common to say, in explanation of our regret that the dawn and\r\nyouth of democracy’s day are past, that our principles are cooler now\r\nand more circumspect, with the coolness and circumspection of advanced\r\nyears. It seems to some that our enthusiasms have become tamer and\r\nmore decorous because our sinews have hardened; that as experience\r\nhas grown idealism has declined. But to speak thus is to speak with\r\nthe old self-deception as to the character of our politics. If we are\r\nsuffering disappointment, it is the disappointment of an awakening:\r\nwe were dreaming. For we never had any business hearkening to Rousseau\r\nor consorting with Europe in revolutionary sentiment. The government\r\nwhich we founded one hundred years ago was no type of an experiment in\r\nadvanced democracy, as we allowed Europe and even ourselves to suppose;\r\nit was simply an adaptation of English constitutional government. If\r\nwe suffered Europe to study our institutions as instances in point\r\ntouching experimentation in politics, she was the more deceived. If\r\nwe began the first century of our national existence under a similar\r\nimpression ourselves, there is the greater reason why we should start\r\nout upon a new century of national life with more accurate conceptions.\r\n\r\nTo this end it is important that the following, among other things,\r\nshould be kept prominently in mind:--\r\n\r\n(1.) That there are certain influences astir in this century which\r\nmake for democracy the world over, and that these influences owe their\r\norigin in part to the radical thought of the last century; but that it\r\nwas not such forces that made us democratic, nor are we responsible\r\nfor them.\r\n\r\n(2.) That, so far from owing our governments to these general\r\ninfluences, we began, not by carrying out any theory, but by simply\r\ncarrying out a history,--inventing nothing, only establishing a\r\nspecialized species of English government; that we founded, not\r\ndemocracy, but constitutional government in America.\r\n\r\n(3.) That the government which we thus set up in a perfectly normal\r\nmanner has nevertheless changed greatly under our hands, by reason both\r\nof growth and of the operation of the general democratic forces,--the\r\nEuropean, or rather worldwide, democratic forces of which I have spoken.\r\n\r\n(4.) That two things, the great size to which our governmental organism\r\nhas attained, and, still more, this recent exposure of its character\r\nand purposes to the common democratic forces of the age of steam and\r\nelectricity, have created new problems of organization, which it\r\nbehooves us to meet in the old spirit, but with new measures.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nFirst, then, for the forces which are bringing in democratic temper\r\nand method the world over. It is matter of familiar knowledge what\r\nthese forces are, but it will be profitable to our thought to pass them\r\nonce more in review. They are freedom of thought and the diffusion of\r\nenlightenment among the people. Steam and electricity have co-operated\r\nwith systematic popular education to accomplish this diffusion. The\r\nprogress of popular education and the progress of democracy have been\r\ninseparable. The publication of their great encyclopædia by Diderot and\r\nhis associates in France in the last century, was the sure sign of the\r\nchange that was setting in. Learning was turning its face away from the\r\nstudious few towards the curious many. The intellectual movement of the\r\nmodern time was emerging from the narrow courses of scholastic thought,\r\nand beginning to spread itself abroad over the extended, if shallow,\r\nlevels of the common mind. The serious forces of democracy will be\r\nfound, upon analysis, to reside, not in the disturbing doctrines of\r\neloquent revolutionary writers, not in the turbulent discontent of\r\nthe pauperized and oppressed, so much as in the educational forces of\r\nthe last hundred and fifty years, which have elevated the masses in\r\nmany countries to a plane of understanding and of orderly, intelligent\r\npurpose more nearly on a level with the average man of the classes that\r\nhave hitherto been permitted to govern. The movements towards democracy\r\nwhich have mastered all the other political tendencies of our day are\r\nnot older than the middle of the last century; and that is just the age\r\nof the now ascendant movement toward systematic popular education.\r\n\r\nYet organized popular education is only one of the quickening\r\ninfluences that have been producing the general enlightenment which\r\nis everywhere becoming the promise of general liberty. Rather, it is\r\nonly part of a great whole, vastly larger than itself. Schools are but\r\nseparated seed-beds, in which the staple thoughts of the steady and\r\nstay-at-home people are prepared and nursed. Not much of the world,\r\nmoreover, goes to school in the school house. But through the mighty\r\ninfluences of commerce and the press the world itself has become a\r\nschool. The air is alive with the multitudinous voices of information.\r\nSteady trade winds of intercommunication have sprung up which carry the\r\nseeds of education and enlightenment, wheresoever planted, to every\r\nquarter of the globe. No scrap of new thought can escape being borne\r\naway from its place of birth by these all-absorbing currents. No idea\r\ncan be kept exclusively at home, but is taken up by the trader, the\r\nreporter, the traveller, the missionary, the explorer, and is given to\r\nall the world, in the newspaper, the novel, the memoir, the poem, the\r\ntreatise, till every community may know, not only itself, but all the\r\nworld as well, for the small price of learning to read and keeping its\r\nears open. All the world, so far as its news and its most insistent\r\nthoughts are concerned, is fast being made every man’s neighbor.\r\n\r\nCarlyle unquestionably touched one of the obvious truths concerning\r\nmodern democracy when he declared it to be the result of printing. In\r\nthe newspaper press a whole population is made critic of all human\r\naffairs; democracy is “virtually extant,” and “democracy virtually\r\nextant will insist on becoming palpably extant.” Looked at in the\r\nlarge, the newspaper press is a type of democracy, bringing all men\r\nwithout distinction under comment made by any man without distinction;\r\nevery topic is reduced to a common standard of news; everything is\r\nnoted and argued about by everybody. Nothing could give surer promise\r\nof popular power than the activity and alertness of thought which are\r\nmade through such agencies to accompany the training of the public\r\nschools. The activity may often be misdirected or unwholesome, may\r\nsometimes be only feverish and mischievous, a grievous product of\r\nnarrow information and hasty conclusion; but it is none the less a\r\nstirring and potent activity. It at least marks the initial stages of\r\neffective thought. It makes men conscious of the existence and interest\r\nof affairs lying outside the dull round of their own daily lives. It\r\ngives them nations, instead of neighborhoods, to look upon and think\r\nabout. They catch glimpses of the international connections of their\r\ntrades, of the universal application of law, of the endless variety\r\nof life, of diversities of race, of a world teeming with men like\r\nthemselves, and yet full of strange customs, puzzled by dim omens,\r\nstained by crime, ringing with voices familiar and unfamiliar.\r\n\r\nAnd all this a man can nowadays get without stirring from home, by\r\nmerely spelling out the print that covers every piece of paper about\r\nhim. If men are thrown, for any reason, into the swift and easy\r\ncurrents of travel, they find themselves brought daily face to face\r\nwith persons native of every clime, with practices suggestive of whole\r\nhistories, with a thousand things which challenge curiosity, inevitably\r\nprovoking inquiries such as enlarge knowledge of life and shake the\r\nmind imperatively loose from old preconceptions.\r\n\r\nThese are the forces which have established the drift towards\r\ndemocracy. When all sources of information are accessible to all men\r\nalike, when the world’s thought and the world’s news are scattered\r\nbroadcast where the poorest may find them, the non-democratic forms\r\nof government must find life a desperate venture. Exclusive privilege\r\nneeds privacy, but cannot have it. Kingship of the elder patterns needs\r\nsanctity, but can find it nowhere obtainable in a world of news items\r\nand satisfied curiosity. The many will no longer receive submissively\r\nthe thought of a ruling few, but insist upon having opinions of their\r\nown. The reaches of public opinion have been infinitely extended; the\r\nnumber of voices that must be heeded in legislation and in executive\r\npolicy has been infinitely multiplied. Modern influences have inclined\r\nevery man to clear his throat for a word in the world’s debates. They\r\nhave popularized everything they have touched.\r\n\r\nIn the newspapers, it is true, there is very little concert between the\r\nwriters; little but piecemeal opinion is created by their comment and\r\nargument; there is no common voice amidst their counsellings. But the\r\naggregate voice thunders with tremendous volume; and that aggregate\r\nvoice is ‘public opinion.’ Popular education and cheap printing and\r\ntravel vastly thicken the ranks of thinkers everywhere that their\r\ninfluence is felt, and by rousing the multitude to take knowledge of\r\nthe affairs of government prepare the time when the multitude will, so\r\nfar as possible, take charge of the affairs of government,--the time\r\nwhen, to repeat Carlyle’s phrase, democracy will become palpably extant.\r\n\r\nBut, mighty as such forces are, democratic as they are, no one can fail\r\nto perceive that they are inadequate to produce of themselves such a\r\ngovernment as ours. There is little in them of constructive efficacy.\r\nThey could not of themselves build any government at all. They are\r\ncritical, analytical, questioning, quizzing forces; not architectural,\r\nnot powers that devise and build. The influences of popular education,\r\nof the press, of travel, of commerce, of the innumerable agencies which\r\nnowadays send knowledge and thought in quick pulsations through every\r\npart and member of society, do not necessarily mould men for effective\r\nendeavor. They may only confuse and paralyze the mind with their myriad\r\nstinging lashes of excitement. They may only strengthen the impression\r\nthat “the world’s a stage,” and that no one need do more than sit\r\nand look on through his ready glass, the newspaper. They overwhelm\r\none with impressions, but do they give stalwartness to his manhood?\r\nDo they make his hand any steadier on the plough, or his purpose any\r\nclearer with reference to the duties of the moment? They stream light\r\nabout him, it may be, but do they clear his vision? Is he better able\r\nto see because they give him countless things to look at? Is he better\r\nable to judge because they fill him with a delusive sense of knowing\r\neverything? Activity of mind is not necessarily strength of mind. It\r\nmay manifest itself in mere dumb show; it may run into jigs as well as\r\ninto strenuous work at noble tasks. A man’s farm does not yield its\r\nfruits the more abundantly in their season because he reads the world’s\r\nnews in the papers. A merchant’s shipments do not multiply because he\r\nstudies history. Banking is none the less hazardous to the banker’s\r\ncapital and taxing to his powers because the best writing of the best\r\nessayists is to be bought cheap.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nVery different were the forces behind us. Nothing establishes the\r\nrepublican state save trained capacity for self-government, practical\r\naptitude for public affairs, habitual soberness and temperateness\r\nof united action. When we look back to the moderate sagacity and\r\nsteadfast, self-contained habit in self-government of the men to whom\r\nwe owe the establishment of our institutions in the United States,\r\nwe are at once made aware that there is no communion between their\r\ndemocracy and the radical thought and restless spirit called by that\r\nname in Europe. There is almost nothing in common between popular\r\noutbreaks such as took place in France at her great Revolution and\r\nthe establishment of a government like our own. Our memories of the\r\nyear 1789 are as far as possible removed from the memories which\r\nEurope retains of that pregnant year. We manifested one hundred\r\nyears ago what Europe lost, namely, self-command, self-possession.\r\nDemocracy in Europe, outside of closeted Switzerland, has acted always\r\nin rebellion, as a destructive force: it can scarcely be said to\r\nhave had, even yet, any period of organic development. It has built\r\nsuch temporary governments as it has had opportunity to erect on the\r\nold foundations and out of the discredited materials of centralized\r\nrule, elevating the people’s representatives for a season to the\r\nthrone, but securing almost as little as ever of that every-day local\r\nself-government which lies so near to the heart of liberty. Democracy\r\nin America, on the other hand, and in the English colonies has had,\r\nalmost from the first, a truly organic growth. There was nothing\r\nrevolutionary in its movements; it had not to overthrow other polities;\r\nit had only to organize itself. It had not to create, but only to\r\nexpand, self-government. It did not need to spread propaganda: it\r\nneeded nothing but to methodize its ways of living.\r\n\r\nIn brief, we were doing nothing essentially new a century ago. Our\r\nstrength and our facility alike inhered in our traditions; those\r\ntraditions made our character and shaped our institutions. Liberty\r\nis not something that can be created by a document; neither is it\r\nsomething which, when created, can be laid away in a document, a\r\ncompleted work. It is an organic principle,--a principle of life,\r\nrenewing and being renewed. Democratic institutions are never done;\r\nthey are like living tissue, always a-making. It is a strenuous thing,\r\nthis of living the life of a free people; and our success in it depends\r\nupon training, not upon clever invention.\r\n\r\nOur democracy, plainly, was not a body of doctrine; it was a stage of\r\ndevelopment. Our democratic state was not a piece of developed theory,\r\nbut a piece of developed habit. It was not created by mere aspirations\r\nor by new faith; it was built up by slow custom. Its process was\r\nexperience, its basis old wont, its meaning national organic oneness\r\nand effective life. It came, like manhood, as the fruit of youth. An\r\nimmature people could not have had it, and the maturity to which it\r\nwas vouchsafed was the maturity of freedom and self-control. Such\r\ngovernment as ours is a form of conduct, and its only stable foundation\r\nis character. A particular form of government may no more be adopted\r\nthan a particular type of character maybe adopted: both institutions\r\nand character must be developed by conscious effort and through\r\ntransmitted aptitudes.\r\n\r\nGovernments such as ours are founded upon discussion, and government\r\nby discussion comes as late in political as scientific thought in\r\nintellectual development. It is a habit of state life created by\r\nlong-established circumstance, and is possible for a nation only in the\r\nadult age of its political life. The people who successfully maintain\r\nsuch a government must have gone through a period of political training\r\nwhich shall have prepared them by gradual steps of acquired privilege\r\nfor assuming the entire control of their affairs. Long and slowly\r\nwidening experience in local self-direction must have prepared them for\r\nnational self-direction. They must have acquired adult self-reliance,\r\nself-knowledge, and self-control, adult soberness and deliberateness of\r\njudgment, adult sagacity in self-government, adult vigilance of thought\r\nand quickness of insight. When practised, not by small communities, but\r\nby wide nations, democracy, far from being a crude form of government,\r\nis possible only amongst peoples of the highest and steadiest political\r\nhabit. It is the heritage of races purged alike of hasty barbaric\r\npassions and of patient servility to rulers, and schooled in temperate\r\ncommon counsel. It is an institution of political noonday, not of the\r\nhalf-light of political dawn. It can never be made to sit easily or\r\nsafely on first generations, but strengthens through long heredity. It\r\nis poison to the infant, but tonic to the man. Monarchies may be made,\r\nbut democracies must grow.\r\n\r\nIt is a deeply significant fact, therefore, again and again to be\r\ncalled to mind, that only in the United States, in a few other\r\ngovernments begotten of the English race, and in Switzerland, where\r\nold Teutonic habit has had the same persistency as in England, have\r\nexamples yet been furnished of successful democracy of the modern type.\r\nEngland herself is close upon democracy. Her backwardness in entering\r\nupon its full practice is no less instructive as to the conditions\r\nprerequisite to democracy than is the forwardness of her offspring.\r\nShe sent out to all her colonies which escaped the luckless beginning\r\nof being made penal settlements, comparatively small, homogeneous\r\npopulations of pioneers, with strong instincts of self-government, and\r\nwith no social materials out of which to build government otherwise\r\nthan democratically. She herself, meanwhile, retained masses of\r\npopulation never habituated to participation in government, untaught in\r\npolitical principle either by the teachers of the hustings or of the\r\nschool house. She has had to approach democracy, therefore, by slow\r\nand cautious extensions of the franchise to those prepared for it;\r\nwhile her better colonies, born into democracy, have had to receive all\r\ncomers within their pale. She has been paring down exclusive privileges\r\nand levelling classes; the colonies have from the first been asylums of\r\ncivil equality. They have assimilated new while she has prepared old\r\npopulations.\r\n\r\nErroneous as it is to represent government as only a commonplace\r\nsort of business, little elevated in method above merchandising, and\r\nto be regulated by counting-house principles, the favor easily won\r\nfor such views among our own people is very significant. It means\r\nself-reliance in government. It gives voice to the eminently modern\r\ndemocratic feeling that government is no hidden cult, to be left to a\r\nfew specially prepared individuals, but a common, every-day concern of\r\nlife, even if the biggest such concern. It is this self-confidence, in\r\nmany cases mistaken, no doubt, which is gradually spreading among other\r\npeoples, less justified in it than are our own.\r\n\r\nOne cannot help marvelling that facts so obvious as these should have\r\nescaped the perception of some of the sagest thinkers and most thorough\r\nhistorical scholars of our day. Yet so it is. Sir Henry Maine, even,\r\nthe great interpreter to Englishmen of the historical forces operative\r\nin law and social institutions, has utterly failed, in his plausible\r\nwork on _Popular Government_, to distinguish the democracy, or rather\r\nthe popular government, of the English race, which is bred by slow\r\ncircumstance and founded upon habit, from the democracy of other\r\npeoples, which is bred by discontent and founded upon revolution.\r\nHe has missed that most obvious teaching of events, that successful\r\ndemocracy differs from unsuccessful in being a product of history,--a\r\nproduct of forces not suddenly become operative, but slowly working\r\nupon whole peoples for generations together. The level of democracy is\r\nthe level of every-day habit, the level of common national experiences,\r\nand lies far below the elevations of ecstasy to which the revolutionist\r\nclimbs.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nWhile there can be no doubt about the derivation of our government from\r\nhabit rather than from doctrine, from English experience rather than\r\nfrom European thought; while it is evident that our institutions were\r\noriginally but products of a long, unbroken, unperverted constitutional\r\nhistory; and certain that we shall preserve our institutions in their\r\nintegrity and efficiency only so long as we keep true in our practice\r\nto the traditions from which our first strength was derived, there\r\nis, nevertheless, little doubt that the forces peculiar to the new\r\ncivilization of our day, and not only these, but also the restless\r\nforces of European democratic thought and anarchic turbulence brought\r\nto us in such alarming volume by immigration, have deeply affected and\r\nmay deeply modify the forms and habits of our politics.\r\n\r\nAll vital governments--and by vital governments I mean those which have\r\nlife in their outlying members as well as life in their heads--all\r\nsystems in which self-government lives and retains its self-possession,\r\nmust be governments by neighbors, by peoples not only homogeneous, but\r\ncharacterized within by the existence among their members of a quick\r\nsympathy and an easy neighborly knowledge of each other. Not foreseeing\r\nsteam and electricity or the diffusion of news and knowledge which\r\nwe have witnessed, our fathers were right in thinking it impossible\r\nfor the government which they had founded to spread without strain or\r\nbreak over the whole of the continent. Were not California now as near\r\nneighbor to the Atlantic States as Massachusetts then was to New York,\r\nnational self-government on our present scale would assuredly hardly\r\nbe possible, or conceivable even. Modern science, scarcely less than\r\nour pliancy and steadiness in political habit, may be said to have\r\ncreated the United States of to-day.\r\n\r\nUpon some aspects of this growth it is very pleasant to dwell, and very\r\nprofitable. It is significant of a strength which it is inspiring to\r\ncontemplate. The advantages of bigness accompanied by abounding life\r\nare many and invaluable. It is impossible among us to hatch in a corner\r\nany plot which will affect more than a corner. With life everywhere\r\nthroughout the continent, it is impossible to seize illicit power over\r\nthe whole people by seizing any central offices. To hold Washington\r\nwould be as useless to a usurper as to hold Duluth. Self-government\r\ncannot be usurped.\r\n\r\nA French writer has said that the autocratic ascendency of Andrew\r\nJackson illustrated anew the long-credited tendency of democracies to\r\ngive themselves over to one hero. The country is older now than it was\r\nwhen Andrew Jackson delighted in his power, and few can believe that\r\nit would again approve or applaud childish arrogance and ignorant\r\narbitrariness like his; but even in his case, striking and ominous as\r\nit was, it must not be overlooked that he was suffered only to strain\r\nthe Constitution, not to break it. He held his office by orderly\r\nelection; he exercised its functions within the letter of the law;\r\nhe could silence not one word of hostile criticism; and, his second\r\nterm expired, he passed into private life as harmlessly as did James\r\nMonroe. A nation that can quietly reabsorb a vast victorious army is\r\nno more safely free and healthy than is a nation that could reabsorb\r\nsuch a President as Andrew Jackson, sending him into seclusion at the\r\nHermitage to live without power, and die almost forgotten.\r\n\r\nA huge, stalwart body politic like ours, with quick life in every\r\nindividual town and county, is apt, too, to have the strength of\r\nvariety of judgment. Thoughts which in one quarter kindle enthusiasm\r\nmay in another meet coolness or arouse antagonism. Events which are\r\nfuel to the passions of one section may be but as a passing wind to\r\nanother section. No single moment of indiscretion, surely, can easily\r\nbetray the whole country at once. There will be entire populations\r\nstill cool, self-possessed, unaffected. Generous emotions sometimes\r\nsweep whole peoples, but, happily, evil passions, sinister views,\r\nbase purposes, do not and cannot. Sedition cannot surge through the\r\nhearts of a wakeful nation as patriotism can. In such organisms poisons\r\ndiffuse themselves slowly; only healthful life has unbroken course. The\r\nsweep of agitations set afoot for purposes unfamiliar or uncongenial\r\nto the customary popular thought is broken by a thousand obstacles.\r\nIt may be easy to reawaken old enthusiasms, but it must be infinitely\r\nhard to create new ones, and impossible to surprise a whole people into\r\nunpremeditated action.\r\n\r\nIt is well to give full weight to these great advantages of our big\r\nand strenuous and yet familiar way of conducting affairs; but it is\r\nimperative at the same time to make very plain the influences which are\r\npointing toward changes in our politics--changes which threaten loss of\r\norganic wholeness and soundness. The union of strength with bigness\r\ndepends upon the maintenance of character, and it is just the character\r\nof the nation which is being most deeply affected and modified by the\r\nenormous immigration which, year after year, pours into the country\r\nfrom Europe. Our own temperate blood, schooled to self-possession and\r\nto the measured conduct of self-government, is receiving a constant\r\ninfusion and yearly experiencing a partial corruption of foreign blood.\r\nOur own equable habits have been crossed with the feverish humors of\r\nthe restless Old World. We are unquestionably facing an ever-increasing\r\ndifficulty of self-command with ever-deteriorating materials, possibly\r\nwith degenerating fibre. We have so far succeeded in retaining\r\n\r\n    “Some sense of duty, something of a faith,\r\n    Some reverence for the laws ourselves have made,\r\n    Some patient force to change them when we will,\r\n    Some civic manhood firm against the crowd;”\r\n\r\nBut we must reckon our power to continue to do so with a people made up\r\nof “minds cast in every mould of race,--minds inheriting every bias of\r\nenvironment, warped by the diverse histories of a score of different\r\nnations, warmed or chilled, closed or expanded, by almost every climate\r\non the globe.”\r\n\r\nWhat was true of our early circumstances is not true of our present. We\r\nare not now simply carrying out under normal conditions the principles\r\nand habits of English constitutional history. Our tasks of construction\r\nare not done. We have not simply to conduct, but also to preserve and\r\nfreshly adjust our government. Europe has sent her habits to us, and\r\nshe has sent also her political philosophy, a philosophy which has\r\nnever been purged by the cold bath of practical politics. The communion\r\nwhich we did not have at first with her heated and mistaken ambitions,\r\nwith her radical, speculative habit in politics, with her readiness\r\nto experiment in forms of government, we may possibly have to enter\r\ninto now that we are receiving her populations. Not only printing and\r\nsteam and electricity have gotten hold of us to expand our English\r\ncivilization, but also those general, and yet to us alien, forces of\r\ndemocracy of which mention has already been made; and these are apt to\r\ntell disastrously upon our Saxon habits in government.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nIt is thus that we are brought to our fourth and last point. We have\r\nnoted (1) the general forces of democracy which have been sapping\r\nold forms of government in all parts of the world; (2) the error of\r\nsupposing ourselves indebted to those forces for the creation of our\r\ngovernment, or in any way connected with them in our origins; and (3)\r\nthe effect they have nevertheless had upon us as parts of the general\r\ninfluences of the age, as well as by reason of our vast immigration\r\nfrom Europe. What, now, are the new problems which have been prepared\r\nfor our solution by reason of our growth and of the effects of\r\nimmigration? They may require as much political capacity for their\r\nproper solution as any that confronted the architects of our government.\r\n\r\nThese problems are chiefly problems of organization and leadership.\r\nWere the nation homogeneous, were it composed simply of later\r\ngenerations of the same stock by which our institutions were planted,\r\nfew adjustments of the old machinery of our politics would, perhaps,\r\nbe necessary to meet the exigencies of growth. But every added element\r\nof variety, particularly every added element of foreign variety,\r\ncomplicates even the simpler questions of politics. The dangers\r\nattending that variety which is heterogeneity in so vast an organism\r\nas ours are, of course, the dangers of disintegration--nothing less;\r\nand it is unwise to think these dangers remote and merely contingent\r\nbecause they are not as yet very menacing. We are conscious of oneness\r\nas a nation, of vitality, of strength, of progress; but are we often\r\nconscious of common thought in the concrete things of national policy?\r\nDoes not our legislation wear the features of a vast conglomerate? Are\r\nwe conscious of any national leadership? Are we not, rather, dimly\r\naware of being pulled in a score of directions by a score of crossing\r\ninfluences, a multitude of contending forces?\r\n\r\nThis vast and miscellaneous democracy of ours must be led; its giant\r\nfaculties must be schooled and directed. Leadership cannot belong\r\nto the multitude; masses of men cannot be self-directed, neither can\r\ngroups of communities. We speak of the sovereignty of the people, but\r\nthat sovereignty, we know very well, is of a peculiar sort; quite\r\nunlike the sovereignty of a king or of a small, easily concerting\r\ngroup of confident men. It is judicial merely, not creative. It\r\npasses judgment or gives sanction, but it cannot direct or suggest.\r\nIt furnishes standards, not policies. Questions of government are\r\ninfinitely complex questions, and no multitude can of themselves\r\nform clear-cut, comprehensive, consistent conclusions touching them.\r\nYet without such conclusions, without single and prompt purposes,\r\ngovernment cannot be carried on. Neither legislation nor administration\r\ncan be done at the ballot box. The people can only accept the\r\ngoverning act of representatives. But the size of the modern democracy\r\nnecessitates the exercise of persuasive power by dominant minds in the\r\nshaping of popular judgments in a very different way from that in which\r\nit was exercised in former times. “It is said by eminent censors of\r\nthe press,” said Mr. Bright on one occasion in the House of Commons,\r\n“that this debate will yield about thirty hours of talk, and will end\r\nin no result. I have observed that all great questions in this country\r\nrequire thirty hours of talk many times repeated before they are\r\nsettled. There is much shower and much sunshine between the sowing of\r\nthe seed and the reaping of the harvest, but the harvest is generally\r\nreaped after all.” So it must be in all self-governing nations of\r\nto-day. They are not a single audience within sound of an orator’s\r\nvoice, but a thousand audiences. Their actions do not spring from a\r\nsingle thrill of feeling, but from slow conclusions following upon much\r\ntalk. The talk must gradually percolate through the whole mass. It\r\ncannot be sent straight through them so that they are electrified as\r\nthe pulse is stirred by the call of a trumpet. A score of platforms in\r\nevery neighborhood must ring with the insistent voice of controversy;\r\nand for a few hundreds who hear what is said by the public speakers,\r\nmany thousands must read of the matter in the newspapers, discuss\r\nit interjectionally at the breakfast-table, desultorily in the\r\nstreet-cars, laconically on the streets, dogmatically at dinner; all\r\nthis with a certain advantage, of course. Through so many stages\r\nof consideration passion cannot possibly hold out. It gets chilled\r\nby over-exposure. It finds the modern popular state organized for\r\ngiving and hearing counsel in such a way that those who give it must\r\nbe careful that it is such counsel as will wear well. Those who\r\nhear it handle and examine it enough to test its wearing qualities\r\nto the utmost. All this, however, when looked at from another point\r\nof view, but illustrates an infinite difficulty of achieving energy\r\nand organization. There is a certain peril almost of disintegration\r\nattending such phenomena.\r\n\r\nEvery one now knows familiarly enough how we accomplished the wide\r\naggregations of self-government characteristic of the modern time, how\r\nwe have articulated governments as vast and yet as whole as continents\r\nlike our own. The instrumentality has been representation, of which the\r\nancient world knew nothing, and lacking which it always lacked national\r\nintegration. Because of representation and the railroads to carry\r\nrepresentatives to distant capitals, we have been able to rear colossal\r\nstructures like the government of the United States as easily as the\r\nancients gave political organization to a city; and our great building\r\nis as stout as was their little one.\r\n\r\nBut not until recently have we been able to see the full effects of\r\nthus sending men to legislate for us at capitals distant the breadth\r\nof a continent. It makes the leaders of our politics, many of them,\r\nmere names to our consciousness instead of real persons whom we have\r\nseen and heard, and whom we know. We have to accept rumors concerning\r\nthem, we have to know them through the variously colored accounts\r\nof others; we can seldom test our impressions of their sincerity by\r\nstanding with them face to face. Here certainly the ancient pocket\r\nrepublics had much the advantage of us: in them citizens and leaders\r\nwere always neighbors; they stood constantly in each other’s presence.\r\nEvery Athenian knew Themistocles’s manner, and gait, and address, and\r\nfelt directly the just influence of Aristides. No Athenian of a later\r\nperiod needed to be told of the vanities and fopperies of Alcibiades,\r\nany more than the elder generation needed to have described to them the\r\npersonality of Pericles.\r\n\r\nOur separation from our leaders is the greater peril, because\r\ndemocratic government more than any other needs organization in order\r\nto escape disintegration; and it can have organization only by full\r\nknowledge of its leaders and full confidence in them. Just because it\r\nis a vast body to be persuaded, it must know its persuaders; in order\r\nto be effective, it must always have choice of men who are impersonated\r\npolicies. Just because none but the finest mental batteries, with pure\r\nmetals and unadulterated acids, can send a current through so huge and\r\nyet so rare a medium as democratic opinion, it is the more necessary\r\nto look to the excellence of these instrumentalities. There is no\r\npermanent place in democratic leadership except for him who “hath clean\r\nhands and a pure heart.” If other men come temporarily into power among\r\nus, it is because we cut our leadership up into so many small parts,\r\nand do not subject any one man to the purifying influences of centred\r\nresponsibility. Never before was consistent leadership so necessary;\r\nnever before was it necessary to concert measures over areas so vast,\r\nto adjust laws to so many interests, to make a compact and intelligible\r\nunit out of so many fractions, to maintain a central and dominant force\r\nwhere there are so many forces.\r\n\r\nIt is a noteworthy fact that the admiration for our institutions\r\nwhich has during the past few years so suddenly grown to large\r\nproportions among publicists abroad is almost all of it directed to\r\nthe restraints we have effected upon the action of government. Sir\r\nHenry Maine thought our federal Constitution an admirable reservoir,\r\nin which the mighty waters of democracy are held at rest, kept back\r\nfrom free destructive course. Lord Rosebery has wondering praise for\r\nthe security of our Senate against usurpation of its functions by the\r\nHouse of Representatives. Mr. Goldwin Smith supposes the saving act\r\nof organization for a democracy to be the drafting and adoption of a\r\nwritten constitution. Thus it is always the static, never the dynamic,\r\nforces of our government which are praised. The greater part of our\r\nforeign admirers find our success to consist in the achievement of\r\nstable safeguards against hasty or retrogressive action; we are asked\r\nto believe that we have succeeded because we have taken Sir Archibald\r\nAlison’s advice, and have resisted the infection of revolution by\r\nstaying quite still.\r\n\r\nBut, after all, progress is motion, government is action. The waters\r\nof democracy are useless in their reservoirs unless they may be used\r\nto drive the wheels of policy and administration. Though we be the\r\nmost law-abiding and law-directed nation in the world, law has not\r\nyet attained to such efficacy among us as to frame, or adjust, or\r\nadminister itself. It may restrain, but it cannot lead us; and I\r\nbelieve that unless we concentrate legislative leadership--leadership,\r\nthat is, in progressive policy--unless we give leave to our nationality\r\nand practice to it by such concentration, we shall sooner or later\r\nsuffer something like national paralysis in the face of emergencies. We\r\nhave no one in Congress who stands for the nation. Each man stands but\r\nfor his part of the nation; and so management and combination, which\r\nmay be effected in the dark, are given the place that should be held by\r\ncentred and responsible leadership, which would of necessity work in\r\nthe focus of the national gaze.\r\n\r\nWhat is the valuable element in monarchy which causes men constantly\r\nto turn to it as to an ideal form of government, could it but be kept\r\npure and wise? It is its cohesion, its readiness and power to act,\r\nits abounding loyalty to certain concrete things, to certain visible\r\npersons, its concerted organization, its perfect model of progressive\r\norder. Democracy abounds with vitality; but how shall it combine with\r\nits other elements of life and strength this power of the governments\r\nthat know their own minds and their own aims? We have not yet reached\r\nthe age when government may be made impersonal.\r\n\r\nThe only way in which we can preserve our nationality in its integrity\r\nand its old-time originative force in the face of growth and imported\r\nchange is by concentrating it; by putting leaders forward, vested with\r\nabundant authority in the conception and execution of policy. There is\r\nplenty of the old vitality in our national character to tell, if we\r\nwill but give it leave. Give it leave, and it will the more impress and\r\nmould those who come to us from abroad. I believe that we have not made\r\nenough of leadership.\r\n\r\n    “A people is but the attempt of many\r\n    To rise to the completer life of one;\r\n    And those who live as models for the mass\r\n    Are singly of more value than they all.”\r\n\r\nWe shall not again have a true national life until we compact it by\r\nsuch legislative leadership as other nations have. But once thus\r\ncompacted and embodied, our nationality is safe. An acute English\r\nhistorical scholar has said that “the Americans of the United States\r\nare a nation because they once obeyed a king;” we shall remain a nation\r\nonly by obeying leaders.\r\n\r\n    “Keep but the model safe,\r\n    New men will rise to study it.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT UNDER THE CONSTITUTION\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is by no means wholly to our advantage that our constitutional law\r\nis contained in definitive written documents. The fact that it is thus\r\nformulated and rendered fixed and definite has seriously misled us, it\r\nis to be feared, as to the true function and efficacy of constitutional\r\nlaw. That law is not made more valid by being written, but only more\r\nexplicit; it is not rendered more sacred, but only more definite and\r\nsecure. Written constitutions are simply more or less successful\r\ngeneralizations of political experience. Their tone of authority does\r\nnot at all alter the historical realities and imperative practical\r\nconditions of government. They determine forms, utter distinct\r\npurposes, set the powers of the State in definite hierarchy; but they\r\ndo not make the forms they originate workable, or the purposes they\r\nutter feasible. All that must depend upon the men who become governors\r\nand upon the people over whom they are set in authority. Laws can have\r\nno other life than that which is given them by the men who administer\r\nand the men who obey them. Constitutional law affords no exception to\r\nthe rule. The Constitution of the United States, happily, was framed by\r\nexceptional men thoroughly schooled in the realities of government. It\r\nconsists, accordingly, not of principles newly invented, to be put into\r\noperation by means of devices originated for the occasion, but of sound\r\npieces of tested experience. It has served its purpose beneficently,\r\nnot because it was written, but because it has proved itself accordant\r\nin every essential part with tried principles of government--principles\r\ntested by the race for whose use it was intended, and therefore\r\nalready embedded in their lives and practices. Its strength will be\r\nfound, upon analysis, to lie in its definiteness and in its power to\r\nrestrain rather than in any unusual excellence of its energetic parts.\r\nFor the right operation of these it has had to depend, like other\r\nconstitutions, upon the virtue and discretion of the people and their\r\nministers. “The public powers are carefully defined; the mode in which\r\nthey are to be exercised is fixed; and the amplest securities are taken\r\nthat none of the more important constitutional arrangements shall be\r\naltered without every guarantee of caution and every opportunity for\r\ndeliberation.... It would seem that, by a wise constitution, democracy\r\nmay be made nearly as calm as water in a great artificial reservoir.”[D]\r\n\r\n    [D] Sir Henry Maine: Popular Government (Am. ed.), pp. 110, 111.\r\n\r\nWe possess, therefore, not a more suitable constitution than other\r\ncountries, but a constitution which is perfectly definite and which\r\nis preserved by very formidable difficulties of amendment against\r\ninconsiderate change. The difference between our own case and that\r\nof Great Britain upon which we have most reason to congratulate\r\nourselves is that here public opinion has definite _criteria_ for its\r\nconservatism; whereas in England it has only shifting and uncertain\r\nprecedent. In both countries there is the same respect for law. But\r\nthere is not in England the same certainty as to what the law of the\r\nconstitution is. We have a fundamental law which is written, and which\r\nin its main points is read by all alike in a single accepted sense.\r\nThere is no more quarrel about its main intent than there is in England\r\nabout the meaning of Magna Charta. Much of the British constitution, on\r\nthe contrary, has not the support of even a common statute. It may, in\r\nrespect of many vital parts of it, be interpreted or understood in half\r\na dozen different ways, _and amended by the prevalent understanding_.\r\nWe are not more free than the English; we are only more secure.\r\n\r\nThe definiteness of our Constitution, nevertheless, apart from its\r\noutline of structural arrangements and of the division of functions\r\namong the several departments of the government, is negative rather\r\nthan affirmative. Its very enumeration of the powers of Congress is\r\nbut a means of indicating very plainly what Congress can _not_ do.\r\nIt is significant that one of the most important and most highly\r\nesteemed of the many legal commentaries on our government should be\r\nentitled ‘Constitutional Limitations.’ In expounding the restrictions\r\nimposed by fundamental law upon state and federal action, Judge\r\nCooley is allowed to have laid bare the most essential parts of our\r\nconstitutional system. It was a prime necessity in so complex a\r\nstructure that bounds should be set to authority. The ‘may-nots’ and\r\nthe ‘shall-nots’ of our constitutions, consequently, give them their\r\ndistinctive form and character. The strength which preserves the system\r\nis the strength of self-restraint.\r\n\r\nAnd yet here again it must be understood that mere definiteness of\r\nlegal provision has no saving efficacy of its own. These distinct lines\r\nrun between power and power will not of their own virtue maintain\r\nthemselves. It is not in having such a constitution but in obeying\r\nit that our advantage lies. The vitality of such provisions consists\r\nwholly in the fact that they receive our acquiescence. They rest\r\nupon the legal conscience, upon what Mr. Grote would have called the\r\n‘constitutional morality,’ of our race. They are efficient because we\r\nare above all things law-abiding. The prohibitions of the law do not\r\nassert themselves as taskmasters set over us by some external power.\r\nThey are of our own devising. We are self-restrained.\r\n\r\nThis legal conscience manifestly constitutes the only guarantee, for\r\nexample, of the division of powers between the state and federal\r\ngovernments, that chief arrangement of our constitutional system. The\r\nintegrity of the powers possessed by the States has from the first\r\ndepended solely upon the conservatism of the federal courts. State\r\nfunctions have certainly not decayed; but they have been preserved, not\r\nby virtue of any forces of self-defence of their own, but because the\r\nnational government has been vouchsafed the grace of self-restraint.\r\nWhat curtailment their province might suffer has been illustrated\r\nin several notable cases in which the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates has confirmed to the general government extensive powers of\r\npunishing state judicial and executive officers for disobedience to\r\nstate laws. Although the federal courts have generally held Congress\r\nback from aggressions upon the States, they have nevertheless once\r\nand again countenanced serious encroachments upon state powers; and\r\ntheir occasional laxity of principle on such points is sufficiently\r\nsignificant of the fact that there is no _balance_ between the state\r\nand federal governments, but only the safeguard of a customary\r\n‘constitutional morality’ on the part of the federal courts. The actual\r\nencroachments upon state rights which those courts have permitted,\r\nunder the pressure of strong political interests at critical periods,\r\nwere not, however, needed to prove the potential supremacy of the\r\nfederal government. They only showed how that potential supremacy would\r\non occasion become actual supremacy. There is no guarantee but that of\r\nconscience that justice will be accorded a suitor when his adversary is\r\nboth court and opposing litigant. So strong is the instinct of those\r\nwho administer our governments to keep within the sanction of the law,\r\nthat even when the last three amendments to the Constitution were being\r\nforced upon the southern states by means which were revolutionary the\r\noutward forms of the Constitution were observed. It was none the less\r\nobvious, however, with what sovereign impunity the national government\r\nmight act in stripping those forms of their genuineness. As there are\r\ntimes of sorrow or of peril which try men’s souls and lay bare the\r\ninner secrets of their characters, so there are times of revolution\r\nwhich act as fire in burning away all but the basic elements of\r\nconstitutions. It is then, too, that dormant powers awake which are not\r\nafterward readily lulled to sleep again.\r\n\r\nSuch was certainly the effect of the civil war upon the Constitution of\r\nthe Union. The implying of powers, once cautious, is now become bold\r\nand confident. In the discussions now going forward with reference to\r\nfederal regulation of great corporations, and with reference to federal\r\naid to education, there are scores of writers and speakers who tacitly\r\nassume the power of the federal government to act in such matters, for\r\none that urges a constitutional objection. Constitutional objections,\r\nbefore the war habitual, have, it would seem, permanently lost their\r\nprominence.\r\n\r\nThe whole energy of origination under our system rests with Congress.\r\nIt stands at the front of all government among us; it is the single\r\naffirmative voice in national policy. First or last, it determines what\r\nis to be done. The President, indeed, appoints officers and negotiates\r\ntreaties, but he does so subject to the ‘yes’ of the Senate. Congress\r\norganizes the executive departments, organizes the army, organizes the\r\nnavy. It audits, approves, and pays expenses. It conceives and directs\r\nall comprehensive policy. All else is negation. The President says\r\n‘no’ in his vetoes; the Supreme Court says ‘no’ in its restraining\r\ndecisions. And it is as much the law of public opinion as the law of\r\nthe Constitution that restrains the action of Congress.\r\n\r\nIt is the habit both of English and American writers to speak of the\r\nconstitution of Great Britain as if it were ‘writ in water,’ because\r\nnothing but the will of Parliament stands between it and revolutionary\r\nchange. But is there nothing back of the will of Parliament? Parliament\r\ndare not go faster than the public thought. There are vast barriers\r\nof conservative public opinion to be overrun before a ruinous speed\r\nin revolutionary change can be attained. In the last analysis, our\r\nown Constitution has no better safeguard. We have, as I have already\r\npointed out, the salient advantage of knowing just what the standards\r\nof our Constitution are. They are formulated in a written code, wherein\r\nall men may look and read; whereas many of the designs of the British\r\nsystem are to be sought only in a cloud-land of varying individual\r\nreadings of affairs. From the constitutional student’s point of view,\r\nthere are, for instance, as many different Houses of Lords as there\r\nare writers upon the historical functions of that upper chamber. But\r\nthe public opinion of Great Britain is no more a juggler of precedents\r\nthan is the public opinion of this country. Perhaps the absence\r\nof a written constitution makes it even less a fancier of logical\r\nrefinements. The arrangements of the British constitution have, for all\r\ntheir theoretical instability, a very firm and definite standing in the\r\npolitical habit of Englishmen: and the greatest of those arrangements\r\ncan be done away with only by the extraordinary force of conscious\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\nIt is wholesome to observe how much of our own institutions rests upon\r\nthe same basis, upon no other foundations than those that are laid in\r\nthe opinions of the people. It is within the undoubted constitutional\r\npower of Congress, for example, to overwhelm the opposition of the\r\nSupreme Court upon any question by increasing the number of justices\r\nand refusing to confirm any appointments to the new places which do\r\nnot promise to change the opinion of the court. Once, at least, it\r\nwas believed that a plan of this sort had been carried deliberately\r\ninto effect. But we do not think of such a violation of the spirit of\r\nthe Constitution as possible, simply because we share and contribute\r\nto that public opinion which makes such outrages upon constitutional\r\nmorality impossible by standing ready to curse them. There is a close\r\nanalogy between this virtual inviolability of the Supreme Court and the\r\nintegrity hitherto vouchsafed to the English House of Lords. There may\r\nbe an indefinite creation of peers at any time that a strong ministry\r\nchooses to give the sovereign its imperative advice in favor of such\r\na course. It was, doubtless, fear of the final impression that would\r\nbe made upon public opinion by action so extraordinary, as much as the\r\ntimely yielding of the Lords upon the question at issue, that held the\r\nministry back from such a measure, on one notable occasion. Hitherto\r\nthat ancient upper chamber has had in this regard the same protection\r\nthat shields our federal judiciary.\r\n\r\nIt is not essentially a different case as between Congress and the\r\nExecutive. Here, too, at the very centre of the Constitution, Congress\r\nstands almost supreme, restrained by public opinion rather than by law.\r\nWhat with the covetous admiration of the presidency recently manifested\r\nby some alarmed theorists in England, and the renewed prestige lately\r\ngiven that office by the prominence of the question of civil service\r\nreform, it is just now particularly difficult to apply political facts\r\nto an analysis of the President’s power. But a clear conception of his\r\nreal position is for that very reason all the more desirable. While\r\nhe is a dominant figure in politics would seem to be the best time to\r\nscrutinize and understand him.\r\n\r\nIt is clearly misleading to use the ascendant influence of the\r\nPresident in effecting the objects of civil service reform as an\r\nillustration of the constitutional size and weight of his office.\r\nThe principal part in making administration pure, business-like, and\r\nefficient must always, under any conceivable system of government,\r\nbe taken by the executive. It was certainly taken by the executive\r\nin England thirty years ago; and that much in opposition to the will\r\nof Parliament. The prominence of our President in administrative\r\nreform furnishes no sufficient ground for attributing a singularity of\r\nexecutive influence to the government of this country.\r\n\r\nIn estimating the actual powers of the President it is no doubt best\r\nto begin, as almost all writers in England and America now habitually\r\nbegin, with a comparison between the executives of the two kindred\r\ncountries. Whilst Mr. Bagehot has done more than any other thinker\r\nto clear up the facts of English constitutional practice, he has\r\nalso, there is reason to believe, done something toward obscuring\r\nthose facts. Everybody, for instance, has accepted as wholly true\r\nhis description of the ministry of the Crown as merely an executive\r\ncommittee of the House of Commons; and yet that description is only\r\npartially true. An English cabinet represents, not the Commons only,\r\nbut also the Crown. Indeed, it is itself ‘the Crown.’ All executive\r\nprerogatives are prerogatives which it is within the discretion of the\r\ncabinet itself to make free use of. The fact that it is generally the\r\ndisposition of ministers to defer to the opinion of Parliament in the\r\nuse of the prerogative, does not make that use the less a privilege\r\nstrictly beyond the sphere of direct parliamentary control, to be\r\nexercised independently of its sanction, even secretly on occasion,\r\nwhen ministers see their way clear to serving the state thereby. “The\r\nministry of the day,” says a perspicacious expounder of the English\r\nsystem,[E] “appears in Parliament, on the one hand, as personating the\r\nCrown in the legitimate exercise of its recognized prerogatives; and\r\non the other hand, as the mere agent of Parliament itself, in the\r\ndischarge of the executive and administrative functions of government\r\ncast upon them by law.” Within the province of the prerogative “lie the\r\nstirring topics of foreign negotiations, the management of the army\r\nand navy, public finance, and, in some important respects, colonial\r\nadministration.” Very recent English history furnishes abundant and\r\nstriking evidence of the vitality of the prerogative in these fields\r\nin the hands of the gentlemen who “personate the Crown” in Parliament.\r\n“No subject has been more eagerly discussed of late,” declares Mr.\r\nAmos (page 187), “than that of the province of Parliament in respect\r\nof the making of treaties and the declaration of war. No prerogative\r\nof the Crown is more undisputed than that of taking the initiative in\r\nall negotiations with foreign governments, conducting them throughout,\r\nand finally completing them by the signature and ratification of a\r\ntreaty.... It is a bare fact that during the progress of the British\r\ndiplomatic movements which terminated in the Treaty of Berlin of 1878,\r\nor more properly in the Afghan war of that year,”--including the\r\nsecret treaty by which Turkey ceded Cyprus to England, and England\r\nassumed the protectorate of Asia Minor,--“Parliament never had an\r\nopportunity of expressing its mind on any one of the important and\r\ncomplicated engagements to which the country was being committed, or\r\nupon the policy of the war upon the northwest frontier of India. The\r\nsubjects were, indeed, over and over again discussed in Parliament,\r\nbut always subsequent to irreparable action having been taken by the\r\ngovernment” (page 188). Had Mr. Amos lived to take his narrative\r\nof constitutional affairs beyond 1880, he would have had equally\r\nsignificant instances of ministerial initiative to adduce in the cases\r\nof Egypt and Burmah.\r\n\r\n    [E] Mr. Sheldon Amos: Fifty Years of the English Constitution,\r\n        page 338.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate campaign in the Soudan was the direct outcome of the\r\npurchase of the Suez Canal shares by the British government in 1875.\r\nThe result of that purchase was that “England became pledged in a\r\nwholly new and peculiar way to the support of the existing Turkish and\r\nEgyptian dominion in Egypt; that large English political interests\r\nwere rendered subservient to the decisions of local tribunals in a\r\nforeign country; and that English diplomatic and political action in\r\nEgypt, and indeed in Europe, was trammelled, or at least indirectly\r\ninfluenced, by a narrow commercial interest which could not but weigh,\r\nhowever slightly, upon the apparent purity and simplicity of the\r\nmotives of the English government.” And yet the binding engagements\r\nwhich involved all this were entered into “despite the absence of all\r\nassistance from, or consent of, Parliament.”[F] Such exercises of the\r\nprerogatives of the Crown receive additional weight from “the almost\r\nrecognized right of evolving an army of almost any size from the Indian\r\nseed-plot, of using reserve forces without communication to Parliament\r\nin advance, and of obtaining large votes of credit for prospective\r\nmilitary operations of an indefinite character, the nature of which\r\nParliament is allowed only dimly to surmise” (page 392). The latest\r\nevidence of the “almost recognized” character of such rights was the\r\nwar preparations made by England against Russia in 1885. If to such\r\npowers of committing the country irrevocably to far-reaching foreign\r\npolicies, of inviting or precipitating war, and of using Indian troops\r\nwithout embarrassment from the trammels of the Mutiny Act, there be\r\nadded the great discretionary functions involved in the administration\r\nof colonial affairs, some measure may be obtained of the power wielded\r\nby ministers, not as the mere agents of Parliament, but as personating\r\nthe Crown. Such is in England the independence of action possible to\r\nthe executive.\r\n\r\n    [F] Amos, page 384.\r\n\r\nAs compared with this, the power of the President is insignificant.\r\nOf course, as everybody says, he is more powerful than the sovereign\r\nof Great Britain. If relative personal power were the principle of\r\netiquette, Mr. Cleveland would certainly not have to lift his hat\r\nto the Queen, because the Queen is not the English executive. The\r\nprerogatives of the Crown are still much greater than the prerogatives\r\nof the presidency; they are exercised, however, not by the wearer of\r\nthe crown, but by the ministry of the Crown.\r\n\r\nAs Sir Henry Maine rightly says, the framers of our Constitution,\r\nconsciously or unconsciously, made the President’s office like the\r\nKing’s office under the English constitution of their time,--the\r\nconstitution, namely, of George III., who chose his advisers with or\r\nwithout the assent of Parliament. They took care, however, to pare\r\ndown the model where it seemed out of measure with the exercise of the\r\npeople’s liberty. They allowed the President to choose his ministers\r\nfreely, as George then seemed to have established his right to do; but\r\nthey made the confirmation of the Senate a necessary condition to his\r\nappointments. They vested in him the right of negotiating treaties\r\nwith foreign governments; but he was not to sign and ratify treaties\r\nuntil he had obtained the sanction of the Senate. That oversight of\r\nexecutive action which Parliament had not yet had the spirit or the\r\ninclination to exert, and which it had forfeited its independence by\r\nnot exerting, was forever secured to our federal upper chamber by the\r\nfundamental law. The conditions of mutual confidence and co-operation\r\nbetween executive and legislature now existing in England had not\r\nthen been developed, and consequently could not be reproduced in this\r\ncountry. The posture and disposition of mutual wariness which were\r\nfound existing there were made constitutional here by express written\r\nprovision. In short, the transitional relations of the Crown and\r\nParliament of that day were crystallized in our Constitution, such\r\nguarantees of executive good faith and legislative participation in the\r\nweightier determinations of government as were lacking in the model\r\nbeing sedulously added in the copy.\r\n\r\nThe really subordinate position of the presidency is hidden from\r\nview partly by that dignity which is imparted to the office by its\r\nconspicuous place at the front of a great government, and its security\r\nand definiteness of tenure; partly by the independence apparently\r\nsecured to it by its erection into an entirely distinct and separate\r\n‘branch’ of the government; and partly by those circumstances of our\r\nhistory which have thrust our Presidents forward, during one or two\r\nnotable periods, as real originators of policy and leaders in affairs.\r\nThe President has never been powerful, however, except at such times\r\nas he has had Congress at his back. While the new government was\r\na-making--and principally because it was a-making--Washington and\r\nhis secretaries were looked to by Congress for guidance; and during\r\nthe presidencies of several of Washington’s immediate successors the\r\ncontinued prominence of questions of foreign policy and of financial\r\nmanagement kept the officers of the government in a position of\r\nsemi-leadership. Jackson was masterful with or without right. He\r\nentered upon his presidency as he entered upon his campaign in Florida,\r\nwithout asking too curiously for constitutional warrant for what he was\r\nto undertake. In the settlement of the southern question Congress went\r\nfor a time on all-fours with the President. He was powerful because\r\nCongress was acquiescent.\r\n\r\nBut such cases prove rather the usefulness than the strength of the\r\npresidency. Congress has, at several very grave crises in national\r\naffairs, been seasonably supplied with an energetic leader or agent\r\nin the person of the President. At other times, when Congress was in\r\nearnest in pushing views not shared by the President, our executives\r\nhave either been overwhelmed, as Johnson was, or have had to decline\r\nupon much humbler services. Their negotiations with foreign governments\r\nare as likely to be disapproved as approved; their budgets are cut down\r\nlike a younger son’s portion; their appointments are censured and their\r\nadministrations criticised without chance for a counter-hearing. They\r\ncreate nothing. Their veto is neither revisory nor corrective. It is\r\nmerely obstructive. It is, as I have said, a simple blunt negation,\r\noftentimes necessarily spoken without discrimination against a good\r\nbill because of a single bad clause in it. In such a contest between\r\norigination and negation origination must always win, or government\r\nmust stand still.\r\n\r\nIn England the veto of the Crown has not passed out of use, as is\r\ncommonly said. It has simply changed its form. It does not exist as an\r\nimperative, obstructive ‘No,’ uttered by the sovereign. It has passed\r\nover into the privilege of the ministers to throw their party weight,\r\nreinforced by their power to dissolve Parliament, against measures of\r\nwhich they disapprove. It is a much-tempered instrument, but for that\r\nreason all the more flexible and useful. The old, blunt, antagonistic\r\nveto is no longer needed. It is needed here, however, to preserve the\r\npresidency from the insignificance of merely administrative functions.\r\nSince executive and legislature cannot come into relations of mutual\r\nconfidence and co-operation, the former must be put in a position to\r\nmaintain a creditable competition for consideration and dignity.\r\n\r\nA clear-headed, methodical, unimaginative President like Mr. Cleveland\r\nunaffectedly recognizes the fact that all creating, originating power\r\nrests with Congress, and that he can do no more than direct the\r\ndetails of such projects as he finds commended by its legislation. The\r\nsuggestions of his message he acknowledges to be merely suggestions,\r\nwhich must depend upon public opinion for their weight. If Congress\r\ndoes not regard them, it must reckon with the people, not with him. It\r\nis his duty to tell Congress what he thinks concerning the pending\r\nquestions of the day; it is not his duty to assume any responsibility\r\nfor the effect produced on Congressmen.\r\n\r\nThe English have transformed their Crown into a Ministry, and in\r\ndoing so have recognized both the supremacy of Parliament and the\r\nrôle of leadership in legislation properly belonging to a responsible\r\nexecutive. The result has been that they have kept a strong executive\r\nwithout abating either the power or the independence of the\r\nrepresentative chamber in respect of its legislative function. We, on\r\nthe contrary, have left our executive separate, as the Constitution\r\nmade it; chiefly, it is to be suspected, because the explicit and\r\nconfident gifts of function contained in that positive instrument\r\nhave blinded us by their very positiveness to the real subordination\r\nof the executive resulting from such a separation. We have supposed\r\nthat our President was great because his powers were specific, and\r\nthat our Congress was not supreme because it could not lay its hands\r\ndirectly upon his office and turn him out. In fact, neither the dignity\r\nand power of the executive nor the importance of Congress is served\r\nby the arrangement. Being held off from authoritative suggestion in\r\nlegislation, the President becomes, under ordinary circumstances,\r\nmerely a ministerial officer; whilst Congress, on its part, deprived\r\nof such leadership, becomes a legislative mass meeting instead of a\r\nresponsible co-operating member of a well-organized government. Being\r\nunder the spell of the Constitution, we have been unable to see the\r\nfacts which written documents can neither establish nor change.\r\n\r\nSingularly enough, there is sharp opposition to the introduction\r\ninto Congress of any such leadership on the part of the executive as\r\nthe Ministers of the Crown enjoy in Parliament, on the ground of the\r\nincrease of power which would accrue as a result to the legislature.\r\nIt is said that such a change would, by centring party and personal\r\nresponsibility in Congress, give too great a prominence to legislation;\r\nwould make Congress the object of too excited an interest on the part\r\nof the people. Legislation in Parliament, instead of being piecemeal,\r\ntessellated work, such as is made up in Congress of the various\r\nfragments contributed by the standing committees, is, under each\r\nministry, a continuous, consistent, coherent whole; and, instead of\r\nbearing the sanction of both national parties, is the peculiar policy\r\nof only one of them. It is thought that, if such coherence of plan,\r\ndefiniteness and continuity of aim, and sanction of party were to be\r\ngiven the work of Congress, the resulting concentration of popular\r\ninterest and opinion would carry Congress over all the barriers of the\r\nConstitution to an undisputed throne of illimitable power. In short,\r\nthe potential supremacy of Congress is thought to be kept within\r\nbounds, not by the constitutional power of the executive and the\r\njudiciary, its co-ordinate branches, but by the intrinsic dulness and\r\nconfusion of its own proceedings. It cannot make itself interesting\r\nenough to be great.\r\n\r\nBut this is a two-edged argument, which one must needs handle with\r\ngreat caution. It is evidently calculated to destroy every argument\r\nconstructed on the assumption that it is written laws which are\r\neffective to the salvation of our constitutional arrangements; for\r\nit is itself constructed on the opposite assumption, that it is the\r\nstate of popular interest in the nation which balances the forces of\r\nthe government. It would, too, serve with equal efficacy against any\r\nscheme whatever for reforming the present methods of legislation in\r\nCongress, with which almost everybody is dissatisfied. Any reform\r\nwhich should tend to give to national legislation that uniform, open,\r\nintelligent, and responsible character which it now lacks, would also\r\ncreate that popular interest in the proceedings of Congress which, it\r\nis said, would unhinge the Constitution. Democracy is so delicate a\r\nform of government that it must break down if given too great facility\r\nor efficacy of operation. No one body of men must be suffered to utter\r\nthe voice of the people, lest that voice become, through it, directly\r\nsupreme.\r\n\r\nThe fact of the overtopping power of Congress, however, remains. The\r\nhouses create all governmental policy, with that wide latitude of\r\n‘political discretion’ in the choice of means which the Supreme Court\r\nunstintingly accords them. Congress has often come into conflict\r\nwith the Supreme Court by attempting to extend the province of the\r\nfederal government as against the States; but it has seldom, I believe,\r\nbeen brought effectually to book for any alleged exercise of powers\r\nas against its directly competing branch, the executive. Having by\r\nconstitutional grant the last word as to foreign relations, the control\r\nof the finances, and even the oversight of executive appointments,\r\nCongress exercises what powers of direction and management it pleases,\r\nas fulfilling, not as straining, the Constitution. Government lives\r\nin the origination, not in the defeat, of measures of government. The\r\nPresident obstructs by means of his ‘No;’ the houses govern by means of\r\ntheir ‘Yes.’ He has killed some policies that are dead; they have given\r\nbirth to all policies that are alive.\r\n\r\nBut the measures born in Congress have no common lineage. They have\r\nnot even a traceable kinship. They are fathered by a score or two of\r\nunrelated standing committees: and Congress stands godfather to them\r\nall, without discrimination. Congress, in effect, parcels out its great\r\npowers amongst groups of its members, and so confuses its plans and\r\nobscures all responsibility. It is a leading complaint of Sir Henry\r\nMaine’s against the system in England, which is just under his nose,\r\nthat it confers the preliminary shaping and the initiation of all\r\nlegislation upon the cabinet, a body which deliberates and resolves in\r\nstrict secrecy,--and so reminds him, remotely enough, of the Spartan\r\nEphors and the Venetian Council of Ten. He commends, by contrast,\r\nthat constitution (our own, which he sees at a great distance) which\r\nreserves to the legislature itself the origination and drafting of\r\nits measures. It is hard for us, who have this commended constitution\r\nunder our noses, to perceive wherein we have the advantage. British\r\nlegislation is for the most part originated and shaped by a single\r\ncommittee, acting in secret, whose proposals, when produced, are\r\neagerly debated and freely judged by the sovereign legislative body.\r\nOur legislation is framed and initiated by a great many committees,\r\ndeliberating in secret, whose proposals are seldom debated and only\r\nperfunctorily judged by the sovereign legislative body. It is\r\nimpossible to mistake the position and privileges of the Brutish\r\ncabinet, so great and conspicuous and much discussed are they. They\r\nsimplify the whole British system for men’s comprehension by merely\r\nstanding at the centre of it. But our own system is simple only in\r\nappearance. It is easy to see that our legislature and executive are\r\nseparate, and that the legislature matures its own measures by means of\r\ncommittees of its own members. But it may readily escape superficial\r\nobservation that our legislature, instead of being served, is ruled\r\nby its committees; that those committees prepare their measures in\r\nprivate; that their number renders their privacy a secure secrecy, by\r\nmaking them too many to be watched, and individually too insignificant\r\nto be worth watching; that their division of prerogatives results in a\r\nloss, through diffusion, of all actual responsibility; and that their\r\nco-ordination leads to such a competition among them for the attention\r\nof their respective houses that legislation is rushed, when it is not\r\nparalyzed.\r\n\r\nIt is thus that, whilst all real power is in the hands of Congress,\r\nthat power is often thrown out of gear and its exercise brought\r\nalmost to a standstill. The competition of the committees is the clog.\r\nTheir reports stand in the way of each other, and so the complaint is\r\nwarranted that Congress can get nothing done. Interests which press for\r\nattention in the nation are reported upon by the appropriate committee,\r\nperhaps, but the report gets pushed to the wall. Or they are not\r\nreported upon. They are brought to the notice of Congress, but they\r\ngo to a committee which is unfavorable. The progress of legislation\r\ndepends both upon the fortunes of competing reports and upon the\r\nopinions held by particular committees.\r\n\r\nThe same system of committee government prevails in our state\r\nlegislatures, and has led to some notable results, which have recently\r\nbeen pointed out in a pamphlet entitled _American Constitutions_,\r\ncontributed to the Johns Hopkins series of Studies in History and\r\nPolitical Science by Mr. Horace Davis. In the state legislatures, as\r\nin Congress, the origination and control of legislation by standing\r\ncommittees has led to haphazard, incoherent, irresponsible law-making,\r\nand to a universal difficulty about getting anything done. The result\r\nhas been that state legislatures have been falling into disrepute in\r\nall quarters. They are despised and mistrusted, and many States have\r\nrevised their constitutions in order to curtail legislative powers and\r\nlimit the number and length of legislative sessions. There is in some\r\nStates an apparent inclination to allow legislators barely time enough\r\nto provide moneys for the maintenance of the governments. In some\r\ninstances necessary powers have been transferred from the legislatures\r\nto the courts; in others to the governors. The intent of all such\r\nchanges is manifest. It is thought safer to entrust power to a law\r\ncourt, performing definite functions under clear laws and in accordance\r\nwith strict judicial standards, or to a single conspicuous magistrate,\r\nwho can be watched and cannot escape responsibility for his official\r\nacts, than to entrust it to a numerous body which burrows toward its\r\nends in committee-rooms, getting its light through lobbies; and which\r\nhas a thousand devices for juggling away responsibility, as well as\r\nscores of antagonisms wherewith to paralyze itself.\r\n\r\nLike fear and distrust have often been felt and expressed of late years\r\nconcerning Congress, for like reasons. But so far no attempt has been\r\nmade to restrict either the powers or the time of Congress. Amendments\r\nto the Constitution are difficult almost to the point of impossibility,\r\nand the few definite schemes nowadays put forward for a revision of the\r\nConstitution involve extensions rather than limitations of the powers\r\nof Congress. The fact is that, though often quite as exasperating to\r\nsober public opinion as any state legislature, Congress is neither so\r\nmuch distrusted nor so deserving of distrust. Its high place and vast\r\nsphere in the government of the nation cause its members to be more\r\ncarefully chosen, and its proceedings to be more closely watched, and\r\nfrequently controlled by criticism. The whole country has its eyes\r\non Congress, and Congress is aware of the fact. It has both the will\r\nand the incentive to be judicious and patriotic. Newspaper editors\r\nhave constantly to be saying to their readers, ‘Look what our state\r\nlegislators are doing;’ they seldom have to urge, ‘Look what Congress\r\nis doing.’ It cannot, indeed, be watched easily, or to much advantage.\r\nIt requires a distinct effort to watch it. It has no dramatic contests\r\nof party leaders to attract notice. Its methods are so much after the\r\nfashion of the game of hide-and-seek that the eye of the ordinary man\r\nis quite baffled in trying to understand or follow them, if he try only\r\nat leisure moments. But, at the same time, the interests handled by\r\nCongress are so vast that at least the newspapers and the business men,\r\nif no others, must watch its legislation as best they may. However hard\r\nit may be to observe, it is too influential in great affairs to make it\r\nsafe for the country to give over trying to observe it.\r\n\r\nBut though Congress may always be watched, and so in a measure\r\ncontrolled, despite its clandestine and confusing methods, those\r\nmethods must tend to increase the distrust with which Congress is\r\nwidely regarded; and distrust cannot but enervate, belittle, and\r\ncorrupt this will-centre of the Constitution. The question is not\r\nmerely, How shall the methods of Congress be clarified and its ways\r\nmade purposeful and responsible? There is this greater question at\r\nstake: How shall the essential arrangements of the Constitution be\r\npreserved? Congress is the purposing, designing, aggressive power of\r\nthe national government. Disturbing and demoralizing influences in\r\nthe organism, if there be any, come out from its restless energies.\r\nDamaging encroachments upon ground forbidden to the federal government\r\ngenerally originate in measures of its planning. So long as it\r\ncontinues to be governed by unrelated standing committees, and to take\r\nits resolves in accordance with no clear plan, no single, definite\r\npurpose, so long as what it does continues to be neither evident nor\r\ninteresting, so long must all its exertions of power be invidious; so\r\nlong must its competition with the executive or the judiciary seem\r\nmerely jealous and always underhand: so long must it remain virtually\r\nimpossible to control it through public opinion. As well ask the\r\nstranger in the gallery of the New York Stock Exchange to judge of\r\nthe proceedings on the floor. As well ask a man who has not time to\r\nread all the newspapers in the Union to judge of passing sentiment in\r\nall parts of the country. Congress in its composition is the country\r\nin miniature. It realizes Hobbes’s definition of liberty as political\r\npower divided into small fragments. The standing committees typify\r\nthe individuals of the nation. Congress is better fitted for counsel\r\nthan the voters simply because its members are less than four hundred\r\ninstead of more than ten millions.\r\n\r\nIt has been impossible to carry out the programme of the Constitution;\r\nand, without careful reform, the national legislature will even more\r\ndangerously approach the perilous model of a mass meeting. There are\r\nseveral ways in which Congress can be so integrated as to impart to\r\nits proceedings system and party responsibility. That may be done\r\nby entrusting the preparation and initiation of legislation to a\r\nsingle committee in each house, composed of the leading men of the\r\nmajority in that house. Such a change would not necessarily affect the\r\npresent precedents as to the relations between the executive and the\r\nlegislature. They might still stand stiffly apart. Congress would be\r\nintegrated and invigorated, however, though the whole system of the\r\ngovernment would not be. To integrate that, some common meeting-ground\r\nof public consultation must be provided for the executive and the\r\nhouses. That can be accomplished only by the admission to Congress,\r\nin whatever capacity,--whether simply to answer proper questions and\r\nto engage in debate, or with the full privileges of membership,--of\r\nofficial representatives of the executive who understand the\r\nadministration and are interested and able to defend it. Let the tenure\r\nof ministers have what disconnection from legislative responsibility\r\nmay seem necessary to the preservation of the equality of House and\r\nSenate, and the separation of administration from legislation; light\r\nwould at least be thrown upon administration; it would be given the\r\nsame advantages of public suggestion and unhampered self-defence that\r\nCongress, its competitor, has; and Congress would be constrained to\r\napply system and party responsibility to its proceedings.\r\n\r\nThe establishment in the United States of what is known as\r\n‘ministerial responsibility’ would unquestionably involve some\r\nimportant changes in our constitutional system. I am strongly of the\r\nopinion that such changes would not be too great a price to pay for the\r\nadvantages secured us by such a government. Ministerial responsibility\r\nsupplies the only conditions which have yet proved efficacious, in the\r\npolitical experience of the world, for vesting recognized leadership\r\nin men chosen for their abilities by a natural selection of debate in\r\na sovereign assembly of whose contests the whole country is witness.\r\nSuch survival of the ablest in debate seems the only process available\r\nfor selecting leaders under a popular government. The mere fact that\r\nsuch a contest proceeds with such a result is the strongest possible\r\nincentive to men of first-rate powers to enter legislative service;\r\nand popular governments, more than any other governments, need leaders\r\nso placed that, by direct contact with both the legislative and the\r\nexecutive departments of the government, they shall see the problems of\r\ngovernment at first hand; and so trained that they shall at the same\r\ntime be, not mere administrators, but also men of tact and eloquence,\r\nfitted to persuade masses of men and to draw about themselves a loyal\r\nfollowing.\r\n\r\nIf we borrowed ministerial responsibility from England, we should,\r\ntoo, unquestionably enjoy an infinite advantage over the English in\r\nthe use of it. We should sacrifice by its adoption none of that great\r\nbenefit and security which our federal system derives from a clear\r\nenumeration of powers and an inflexible difficulty of amendment. If\r\nanything would be definite under cabinet government, responsibility\r\nwould be definite; and, unless I am totally mistaken in my estimate of\r\nthe legal conscience of the people of this country,--which seems to\r\nme to be the heart of our whole system,--definite responsibility will\r\nestablish rather than shake those arrangements of our Constitution\r\nwhich are really our own, and to which our national pride properly\r\nattaches, namely, the distinct division of powers between the state and\r\nfederal governments, the slow and solemn formalities of constitutional\r\nchange, and the interpretative functions of the federal courts. If\r\nwe are really attached to these principles, the concentration of\r\nresponsibility in government will doubly insure their preservation. If\r\nwe are not, they are in danger of destruction in any case.\r\n\r\nBut we cannot have ministerial responsibility in its fulness\r\nunder the Constitution as it stands. The most that we can have is\r\ndistinct legislative responsibility, with or without any connection\r\nof co-operation or of mutual confidence between the executive and\r\nCongress. To have so much would be an immense gain. Changes made to\r\nthis end would leave the federal system still an unwieldy mechanism\r\nof counteracting forces, still without unity or flexibility; but we\r\nshould at least have made the very great advance of fastening upon\r\nCongress an even more positive form of accountability than now rests\r\nupon the President and the courts. Questions of vast importance and\r\ninfinite delicacy have constantly to be dealt with by Congress; and\r\nthere is an evident tendency to widen the range of those questions.\r\nThe grave social and economic problems now thrusting themselves\r\nforward, as the result of the tremendous growth and concentration of\r\nour population, and the consequent sharp competition for the means\r\nof livelihood, indicate that our system is already aging, and that\r\nany clumsiness, looseness, or irresponsibility in governmental action\r\nmust prove a source of grave and increasing peril. There are already\r\ncommercial heats and political distempers in our body politic which\r\nwarn of an early necessity for carefully prescribed physic. Under\r\nsuch circumstances, some measure of legislative reform is clearly\r\nindispensable. We cannot afford to put up any longer with such\r\nlegislation as we may happen upon. We must look and plan ahead. We must\r\nhave legislation which has been definitely forecast in party programmes\r\nand explicitly sanctioned by the public voice. Instead of the present\r\narrangements for compromise, piecemeal legislation, we must have\r\ncoherent plans from recognized party leaders, and means for holding\r\nthose leaders to a faithful execution of their plans in clear-cut Acts\r\nof Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n_LIST OF VOLUMES OF ESSAYS ON LITERATURE, ART, MUSIC, ETC., PUBLISHED\r\nBY CHARLES SCRIBNER’S SONS, 743–745 BROADWAY, NEW YORK._\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY ADAMS.\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL ESSAYS.

He is a\r\n    notable writer of good English, who combines in a manner altogether\r\n    his own the flexibility, freedom, quickness and suggestiveness of\r\n    contemporary fashions with a grace, dignity, and high-breeding that\r\n    belong rather to the past.”--_N. Y.
