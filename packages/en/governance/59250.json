Chéradame’s book\r\nwas published in Paris in the summer of this year, before the important\r\noccurrences in the Balkans accompanying and following Roumania’s entrance\r\ninto the war. In issuing this translation no consideration of these\r\nevents has been added; but their bearing on M. Chéradame’s forecast will\r\nbe noted by the reader.\r\n\r\nThe maps have been reproduced direct from the French edition, without\r\ntranslating the names into English, as they answer their purpose\r\nperfectly well in their present form.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                      PAGE\r\n\r\n    INTRODUCTION BY LORD CROMER                                       xiii\r\n\r\n    AUTHOR’S PREFACE                                                   xix\r\n\r\n                                PROLOGUE\r\n\r\n    PANGERMAN AND WILLIAM II.                                            1\r\n\r\n        I.

Chéradame’s most instructive work to the\r\nearnest attention of my countrymen and countrywomen are three-fold.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, M. Chéradame stands conspicuous amongst that very\r\nsmall body of politicians who warned Europe betimes of the German danger.\r\nThe fact that in the past he proved a true prophet gives him a special\r\nclaim to be heard when he states his views as regards the present and the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, I entertain a strong opinion that M. Chéradame’s\r\ndiagnosis of the present situation is, in all its main features, correct.\r\n\r\nIn the third place, in spite of the voluminous war literature which\r\nalready exists, I greatly doubt whether the special aspect of the case\r\nwhich M. Chéradame wishes to present to the public is fully understood in\r\nthis country; neither should I be surprised to hear from those who are\r\nmore qualified than myself to speak on the subject that the same remark\r\napplies, though possibly in a less degree, to the public opinion of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nIt is essential that, before the terms of peace are discussed, a clear\r\nidea should be formed of the reasons which led the German Government\r\nto provoke this war. It is well that, if such a course be at all\r\npossible, those who are personally responsible for the numerous acts of\r\nbarbarity committed by the Germans should receive adequate punishment.\r\nBut attention to points of this sort, however rational and meritorious,\r\nshould not in any degree be allowed to obscure the vital importance\r\nof the permanent political issues which call loudly for settlement.\r\nOtherwise, it is quite conceivable that a peace may be patched up, which\r\nmay have some specious appearance of being favourable to the Allies,\r\nbut which would at the same time virtually concede to the Germans all\r\nthey require in order, after time had been allowed for recuperation, to\r\nrenew, with increased hope of success, their attempts to shatter modern\r\ncivilization and to secure the domination of the world.\r\n\r\nM. Chéradame explains—and I believe with perfect accuracy—the nature of\r\nthe German objective. It is, in his opinion, to lay secure and stable\r\nfoundations for the system known as Pan-Germanism. What is Pan-Germanism?\r\nIt may be doubted whether all that is implied in that term is fully\r\nrealized in this country. One interpretation may be given to the word,\r\nwhich is not merely innocuous, but which may even reasonably appeal\r\nto the sympathies of those who approve of the new map of Europe being\r\nconstituted with a view to applying that nationalist principle, which\r\nfinds almost universal favour in all democratic countries. It cannot be\r\ntoo distinctly understood that the political programme now advocated by\r\nGermany has no sort of affinity with a plan of this sort. The Germans\r\ncontend not only that all those who are generally denominated Germans by\r\nthe rest of the world should be united, but that all who are of what is\r\ntermed “German origin” should be brought into the German fold. Moreover,\r\nthey give to this latter phrase an expansion and a signification which\r\nis condemned and derided by all who have paid serious attention to\r\nethnological studies. This, however, is far from stating the whole case.\r\nThe object of the German Government is to effect the whole or partial\r\nGermanization of countries inhabited by races which cannot, by any\r\nconceivable ethnological process of reasoning, be held to be of German\r\nstock. In fact, M. Chéradame very correctly describes Pan-Germanism when\r\nhe says that its object is to disregard all questions of racial and\r\nlinguistic affinity and to absorb huge tracts of country the possession\r\nof which is considered useful to advance Hohenzollern interests. In other\r\nwords, what they wish is to establish, under the name of Pan-Germanism, a\r\nworld system whose leading and most immediate feature is the creation of\r\nan empire stretching from the Persian Gulf to the North Sea.\r\n\r\nThat this project has for a long while past been in course of preparation\r\nby the Kaiser and his megalomaniac advisers cannot for a moment be\r\ndoubted. When, in November, 1898, William II. pronounced his famous\r\nspeech at Damascus, in which he stated that all the three hundred\r\nmillions of Mohammedans in the world could rely upon him as their\r\ntrue friend, the world was inclined to regard the utterance as mere\r\nrhodomontade. It was nothing of the sort. It involved the declaration of\r\na definite and far-reaching policy, the execution of which was delayed\r\nuntil a favourable moment occurred and, notably, until the Kiel Canal was\r\ncompleted. The whole conspiracy very nearly succeeded. In spite of their\r\ncareful attention to detail, their talent for organization, and their\r\nelaborate preparations to meet what appears to them every contingency\r\nwhich may occur, the Germans seem to have a constitutional inability to\r\ngrasp the motives which guide the inhabitants of other countries. A very\r\nclose analogy to the mistake made by the Kaiser is to be found in an\r\nincident of recent English history. It is alleged, I know not with what\r\ntruth, that when, in 1886, Lord Randolph Churchill resigned his position\r\nas Chancellor of the Exchequer in Lord Salisbury’s administration, he\r\n“forgot Goschen,” who, as it will be remembered, was speedily nominated\r\nto succeed him. The Kaiser forgot England. For various reasons, which are\r\ntoo well-known to require repetition, he and his advisers were firmly\r\nconvinced that England would not join in the war. The programme was,\r\nfirst, to destroy the power of France and Russia, and then, after that\r\nhad been done, to fall upon England. In one sense it was fortunate that\r\nthe Germans committed the gross international crime of invading Belgium.\r\nHad they not done so, it is quite possible that the English nation would\r\nnot have woke up to the realities of the situation. As it was, however,\r\nit became clear, even to the most extreme pacificists, that honour and\r\ninterest alike pointed to the necessity of decisive action. Thus as M.\r\nChéradame indicates, the original German plan was completely upset.\r\nThe advance on Paris had to be stayed. But the programme, which was\r\nthe result of long and deliberate contemplation, has by no means been\r\nabandoned. On the contrary, with the adhesion of the Bulgarians, who\r\nwill eventually, unless the Allies secure a decisive victory, become the\r\nvictims of Pan-Germanism, and also that of the Turks, who were manœuvred\r\ninto the war by an adroit and absolutely unscrupulous diplomacy, a very\r\nconsiderable portion of the plan has already been put into execution.\r\n\r\nM. Chéradame states with great reason that France, Italy, Russia,\r\nEngland, and all the minor Powers are vitally interested in frustrating\r\nthe German project of establishing their dominion from the Persian Gulf\r\nto the North Sea. He also warns us against making a separate peace with\r\neither Austria-Hungary or Turkey, both of these Powers being merely\r\nvassals of Germany. He is very clearly of opinion that the mere cession\r\nof Alsace-Lorraine to France and the rehabilitation of Belgium cannot\r\nform the foundations of a durable peace. If peace were concluded on this\r\nbasis, the Germans would have achieved their main object, and, as Herr\r\nHarden pointed out last February, even if Germany was obliged, under\r\npressure, to cede Alsace-Lorraine, there would still be seventy millions\r\nof Germans firmly determined to regain possession of those provinces at\r\nthe first suitable opportunity. In fact, the realization of the German\r\nproject, although accompanied by certain temporary disabilities from the\r\nGerman point of view, would eventually enable Germany to strangle Europe.\r\n\r\nI need not dwell upon all the proposals set forth by M. Chéradame\r\nwith a view to the frustration of this plan, but the corner-stone of\r\nhis programme is similar to that advocated with great ability in this\r\ncountry by Mr. Wickham Steed and Mr. Seton Watson. It is to create a\r\nSouthern Slav State, which will afford an effectual barrier to German\r\nadvance towards the East. It is essential that the immense importance of\r\ndealing with the territories of the Hapsburgs as a preliminary to a final\r\nsettlement of all the larger aspects of the Eastern question should be\r\nfully realized. It constitutes the key of the whole situation.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, I hope that M. Chéradame’s work, which develops\r\nmore fully the arguments which I have very briefly stated above, will\r\nreceive in this country the attention which it certainly merits. I\r\nshould add that the book is written in a popular style, and that M.\r\nChéradame’s arguments can be easily followed by those who have no special\r\nacquaintance either with Eastern policy or with the tortuous windings of\r\nAustrian and German diplomacy during the last quarter of a century.\r\n\r\n                                                                  CROMER.\r\n\r\n    SEPTEMBER 4, 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pangerman plot is the only cause of the war. It is, in fact, the\r\ncause at once of its outbreak and of its prolongation till that victory\r\nof the Allies has been won which is indispensable to the liberty of the\r\nworld. In this book I propose to demonstrate this truth by a series of\r\ndocuments, precise, clear, and intelligible to all. The fate of every\r\nman in the allied countries, and even in some of the countries which\r\nare still neutral, really depends on the issue of the formidable war\r\nnow being waged. This cataclysm, unprecedented in history, let loose\r\nby Prussianized Germany, will have infinite reverberations in every\r\nsphere, reverberations which will affect every one of us individually\r\nfor good or, alas! too often for ill. Every one, therefore, has a direct\r\ninterest in knowing clearly why these inevitable reverberations of the\r\nimmense struggle will be produced, and on what fundamental conditions\r\nthose of them which bode ill for the Allies, and are yet but imperfectly\r\nunderstood, can and must be avoided. Hence every one of the Allies should\r\nacquire an exact notion of the present realities. Once fortified by the\r\nevidence, his opinion will become a force for the Allied Governments;\r\nit will then contribute to the victory and to the imposition of the\r\nconditions necessary for the peace.\r\n\r\nIn writing this popular book my aim has been to bring home, even to those\r\nwho are least versed in foreign affairs, the formidable problems raised\r\nby the war. In my opinion this work is addressed to women quite as much\r\nas to men. The reading of it may perhaps bring not only instruction but\r\nconsolation to those whose affections have been so cruelly wounded. When\r\nthey comprehend better by what an atrocious plan of slavery the world\r\nis threatened, they will understand more fully for what a sublime, what\r\na stupendous cause their husbands, their sons, their plighted lovers,\r\nare fighting or dying with such heroic self-sacrifice. May that larger\r\nunderstanding of the formidable events now occurring yield to the women\r\nof the Allies at least some alleviation of their sufferings.\r\n\r\nBut if this book is a popular work, I beg my readers to remark that it\r\nis not the result of a hasty effort, vamped up by a mere desire to treat\r\nof the moving, the tragic subject of the hour. The book is, indeed,\r\nthe logical conclusion of a labour on which I have been engaged for\r\ntwenty-one years. As my readers have an interest in knowing how far they\r\nmay trust me, they will allow me to explain to them how I was led to\r\nconcentrate my studies on the Pangerman policy of Germany, what has been\r\nthe result of my efforts, and how they are linked together.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn former days I was the pupil of Albert Sorel at the Free School of\r\nPolitical Science. That great master was good enough to admit me to his\r\nintimacy; and he brought to light and maturity the latent and instinctive\r\npropensity which I had for foreign politics. My practical studies abroad\r\nled me to Germany in 1894, just at the time when the Pangerman _movement_\r\nhad begun. As the movement was manifestly the modern development of the\r\nPrussianism of the Hohenzollerns, I was then extremely struck by its\r\nimportance. The movement appeared to me so threatening for the future\r\nthat I resolved to follow all the developments of the Pangerman _plot_,\r\nwhich was already the consequence of the movement, and which from 1895\r\nonward had taken definite shape. The task which I thus laid on myself\r\nwas at once arduous, vast, and thrilling, for from that time it was\r\ncertain that the Germans based their political and military Pangerman\r\nplan on a study of all the political, ethnographical, economic, social,\r\nmilitary and naval problems not only of Europe but of the whole world.\r\nIn truth, the intense labour accomplished in the cause of Pangermanism\r\nby the Germans in the last twenty-one years has been colossal. They have\r\ncarried it out everywhere with a formidable tenacity and a methodical\r\nthoroughness which will be the astonishment of history. Indisputably, the\r\nPangerman plan, which is the result of this gigantic effort, is the most\r\nextraordinary plot which the world has ever witnessed.\r\n\r\nI made the study of that plot for twenty-one years the work of my life,\r\nconvinced as I was, in spite of the scepticism which long greeted my\r\nefforts to give warning of the peril, that the study would serve a useful\r\npurpose one day.\r\n\r\nThe study has necessitated very many and very long journeys of inquiry. I\r\nwas obliged in fact to go and learn, on the spot, at least the essential\r\nelements of the complex problems mentioned above, which have been the\r\nbase of the Pangerman plan, in order that I might be able to grasp the\r\nmost distant ramifications of the Prussian programme for dominating the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThis obligation led me to sojourn in very different countries. That the\r\nreader may have an idea of at least the material extent of my inquiries,\r\nI will indicate the number of the towns in which I have been led to work\r\nfor the purpose of discovering the constituent elements, direct and\r\nindirect, of the Pangerman plan.\r\n\r\nThe United States, 14; Canada, 11; Japan, 11; Corea, 4; China, 11;\r\nIndo-China, 19; British India, 24; Spain, 1; Italy, 4; Belgium,\r\n6; Luxemburg, 1; Holland, 5; Switzerland, 4; England, 8; Greece,\r\n2; Bulgaria, 4; Roumania, 3; Serbia, 8; Turkey, 3; Germany, 16;\r\nAustro-Hungary, 18.\r\n\r\nIn these towns, according to the requirement of my studies, I passed\r\ndays, weeks, or months, often on repeated occasions. I endeavoured, so\r\nfar as the opportunities and the time admitted of it, to enter into\r\ndirect relations with the acting ministers, the leaders of the various\r\npolitical parties, the diplomatists and the consuls, both French and\r\nforeign, some heads of states, influential journalists, officers of\r\nrepute, military and naval attachés, well-informed merchants and\r\nmanufacturers. It was thus that, by means of information of many sorts\r\ndrawn from the most diverse sources, and checked by comparison with each\r\nother, I have attempted to set forth the Pangerman political and military\r\nplan.\r\n\r\nSince 1898 I have endeavoured to draw the attention of the public to the\r\nimmense danger which that plan was laying up for the world, as my former\r\nworks testify, particularly _L’Europe et la Question d’Autriche au seuil\r\ndu XXe Siècle_, which appeared in 1901, therefore fifteen years ago, and\r\ncontained an exposition, as precise as it was then possible to make it,\r\nof the Pangerman plan of 1895, summed up in the formula “Hamburg to the\r\nPersian Gulf”; also _Le Chemin de fer de Bagdad_, published in 1903,\r\nwherein I set forth the danger of that co-operation between Germany and\r\nTurkey, which was then only nascent, but which we see full-fledged to-day.\r\n\r\nI attempted also by numerous lectures to diffuse among the public some\r\nnotion of the Pangerman peril. I did not content myself with warning\r\nmy countrymen. I am proud to have been one of the first Frenchmen to\r\npreach a cordial understanding between France and England at a time\r\nwhen there was perhaps some merit in doing so. I deemed it, therefore,\r\na duty to inform the British public, so far as it lay in my power, that\r\nthe Pangerman peril concerned Great Britain quite as much as France. In\r\n1909 the Franco-Scottish Society kindly invited me to lecture to its\r\nmembers at Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen. I seized the opportunity, and\r\ntook for the subject of my lectures, “The problem of Central Europe and\r\nuniversal politics.”\r\n\r\n_The Aberdeen Free Press_, of May 8th, 1909, summed up very exactly as\r\nfollows the substance of what I said, seven years ago, to my British\r\nhearers:\r\n\r\n“ ... The lecturer attached enormous importance to the Pan-German\r\nmovement, which he regarded as the decisive factor in the situation,\r\nand he pointed out that the propaganda which had gone on in Germany and\r\nin Austria was part of a great policy to extend the boundaries of the\r\nGerman State and dominate middle and south-eastern Europe. The _rapport\r\npersonnel_ established in recent years between Berlin and Vienna pointed,\r\nhe said, to the conclusion that Germany and Austria were working hand in\r\nhand. In the recent Balkan crisis he described Aehrenthal as playing a\r\n_partie de poker_, in which his bluff had been crowned with success. The\r\noff-set to the Pan-German movement was to be found in the Triple Entente\r\nbetween England, France and Russia, and it followed from a consideration\r\nof European politics that the questions confronting England with regard\r\nto the supremacy of the sea were intimately bound up with the question\r\nwhich concerned the land powers of Europe. In particular, the speaker\r\nthought that the Pan-German aspirations would be effectually combatted by\r\nthe growing social and political development of the various minor Slav\r\npeoples in the south-east of Europe. The development of these peoples was\r\na thing which it was with the interests of England, France and Russia to\r\nencourage to the utmost.”\r\n\r\nMy Scottish hearers gave me a very kind reception, of which I have\r\npreserved a lively recollection. But truth compels me to declare that I\r\nhad the impression that the great majority of them did not believe me. I\r\nstrongly suspect that they then saw in me simply a Frenchman, who, moved\r\nby the spirit of revenge, tried above all to stir up the British public\r\nagainst Germany. The impression did not discourage me any more than many\r\nsimilar instances of want of success. In 1911 the Central Asian Society\r\ndid me the honour of inviting me to express my views in London (22nd\r\nMarch) on the Bagdad railway. I used this fresh opportunity to expound\r\na method of Franco-English co-operation which seemed to me necessary to\r\nparry the dangers of the near future.\r\n\r\n“Such is,” I then said, “broadly speaking, the affair of Bagdad. The most\r\nmoderate conclusion which, in my judgment, inevitably follows is that\r\nfrom beginning to end the logical and methodical spirit of Germany has\r\ngot the better of the French, English, and Russian interests, which have\r\nbeen compromised by our slowness to grasp the importance of the problem\r\nconfronting us, and by the lamentable want of cohesion between the\r\ndiplomacies of the three countries.\r\n\r\n“The lesson apparently to be drawn from these considerations is, that for\r\nthe future we ought no longer to be satisfied with a hand-to-mouth policy\r\nand with seeking solutions only when the difficulties take an acute form.\r\n\r\n“If we wish to serve and defend our interests effectually, we must, as\r\nTalleyrand said, keep the future in mind, and learn something of that\r\nGerman method of which the good results are incontestable.\r\n\r\n“So far as the eye can range to the visible political horizon, the\r\nessential interests of England, France, and Russia are in agreement;\r\nit is, therefore, to all appearance, absolutely necessary that the men\r\nwho exercise an influence on public opinion in this country, in France,\r\nand in Russia, should enter into personal relations in order to discuss\r\nthe great national interests which they have in common, and to adopt a\r\nuseful line of conduct, while there is yet time. Such a course would be\r\neffectual, because it would be determined before the decisive events\r\ninstead of after them, that is to say, when it is too late.\r\n\r\n“Were we to adopt this method, which after all is very simple, the\r\nfuture attempts of our adversaries against our interests would encounter\r\neffectual obstacles, and we should no longer have to regret miscarriages\r\nsuch as those of which the Bagdad affair is an example.”\r\n\r\nHas the method thus recommended been followed? Apparently not; otherwise\r\ncould France and England have been surprised by the war?\r\n\r\nMy propaganda having had little practical result, I endeavoured at least\r\nto keep myself well informed of the events that were happening.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1913, and January, February, and March, 1914, I made new\r\nand minute inquiries in Central Europe, the Balkans, and Turkey, and\r\nthese inquiries were of particular value to me. The truth is, that the\r\ntreaty of Bukarest of August 10th, 1913, by reason of its far-reaching\r\nand important consequences, had completely upset the former state of\r\naffairs, so much so that without my journey of 1914, I should certainly\r\nhave been unable to understand the new situation. In the course of my\r\njourney I set myself to apply, with great rigour, my method of research,\r\nwhich consists essentially in trying to see the situations as they are,\r\nwithout preconceived ideas, while listening to all opinions in order to\r\ncompare them afterwards and extract, if possible, the average truth.\r\nIn Serbia, in Greece, in Turkey, in Roumania, in Bulgaria, where for a\r\nlong time I had been in personal relations with people of many different\r\nsorts, I was able to have long talks with persons in the most diverse\r\nwalks of life. In particular, I had the good fortune to be graciously\r\nreceived by the sovereigns and princes of the Balkans: King Peter of\r\nSerbia (23rd December, 1913), Prince Alexander, heir of Serbia (December,\r\n1913), King Constantine (25th January, 1914), Prince Nicholas of Greece\r\n(28th January), King Charles of Roumania (18th February), Tsar Ferdinand\r\n(28th February), Prince Boris, heir of Bulgaria (29th February). If I\r\nrecord the audiences which these high personages were so good as to grant\r\nme, it is because they were really not commonplace. These sovereigns\r\nand princes knew that I had long studied their country impartially, and\r\nthey consented to speak with me of the great interests which guided\r\ntheir policies. During these various audiences, which lasted from half\r\nan hour to two hours, I heard many points of view of real importance set\r\nforth. No doubt each of my various interlocutors only said to me what he\r\nwished to say; but, thanks to the multiplicity of the opinions expressed\r\nand to the variety of my sources of information, I was able at least to\r\nconstruct a general picture of the true Balkan situation, and to connect\r\nit afterwards with the problem of Central Europe and the general policy\r\nof Germany.\r\n\r\nThis inquiry, which in returning I completed in Hungary and Austria,\r\nconvinced me that, contrary to the opinion which has been held down to\r\nquite recent times in many Allied circles, the treaty of Bukarest by no\r\nmeans constituted an injustice, as the Allies have supposed—a belief\r\nwhich has been the source of most of their mistakes in the Balkans in\r\n1915. On the contrary, the treaty of Bukarest, particularly because it\r\nfor the first time drew Roumania out of the German orbit, appeared to\r\nme the most astonishingly favourable event which had happened on the\r\nContinent since 1870, and which was entirely in accordance with the\r\ninterests of France, England, and Russia. The consequences of this treaty\r\nformed in fact, as we shall see, the most effectual arrangement that\r\ncould be conceived for arresting the Pangerman danger and maintaining\r\npeace in Europe. But this pacific dam to keep back the Pangerman flood\r\nwas only possible on condition that the Entente powers held themselves\r\nready for war, which would probably have sufficed to prevent it, and\r\nthat at the same time they resolutely and unanimously supported Greece,\r\nRoumania, and Serbia.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the check which the treaty of Bukarest gave to the\r\nPangerman plan in Europe, appeared to me so pregnant with consequences\r\nthat I considered it highly probable that the Government of Vienna,\r\ninstigated by that of Berlin, would not shrink from war for the purpose\r\nof undoing the treaty of Bukarest, with its far-reaching effects, at the\r\nearliest possible moment, unless the other powers put themselves on their\r\nguard. On my return to France I tried to explain the imminence of the\r\ndanger, but no one would believe it.\r\n\r\nIn truth, German aggression caught the present Allied countries napping\r\nfor the following fundamental reason. No doubt, before the war,\r\nPangermanism, as a doctrine, was well enough known in some circles, but\r\nthe political and military Pangerman plan, the application of which has\r\nbeen pursued methodically by the government of Berlin since the opening\r\nof hostilities, had not been studied and taken very seriously except by\r\nan extremely small number of private persons in France, England, and\r\nRussia.\r\n\r\nThe efforts made by these private persons to convince the men at the helm\r\nin the now Allied countries of the awful danger ahead, were vain. The\r\nprincipal reason why their warnings fell unheeded was this. When by the\r\nhelp of documents they explained that William II.’s ultimate aim was the\r\nestablishment of German supremacy on the ruins of _all_ the great powers,\r\nthey were taken for crazy dreamers, so chimerical did such formidable\r\nprojects appear.\r\n\r\nThat is why among the Allies the political and military Pangerman plot\r\nwas ignored in its true character and its extent, down to the outbreak\r\nof war. This lack of knowledge in France is proved by a statement in\r\n_Le Temps_ of 16th December, 1915. Before the war, “we did not believe\r\nin the possibility of a war, and we took no pains to prepare for that\r\nredoubtable event.” It was absolutely the same in England, as was\r\ndemonstrated by the complete surprise of Great Britain at the German\r\naggression.\r\n\r\nMore than that, the Kaiser’s entire plan has continued to be\r\nmisunderstood in the Allied countries down to a date which seems quite\r\nrecent. In fact, Sir Edward Carson, when explaining his resignation in\r\nthe House of Commons, November 2nd, 1915, said: “I hope that the new plan\r\nof campaign has been definitely settled, for while I was a member of the\r\nCabinet, the Cabinet had no plan” (quoted by _Le Temps_, 4th November,\r\n1915).\r\n\r\nBut if the Pangerman plan had been known in London, the English and\r\nconsequently the French would certainly have long ago adopted the\r\ncounter-plan which could not have failed to destroy it; for the\r\nPangerman plan consists of such definite and precise elements that the\r\nmere recognition of them at once suggests the means of frustrating\r\nit; in particular, the advantages and the necessity of the Salonika\r\nexpedition, which has been so sharply opposed and so tardily undertaken,\r\nwould have been understood from the beginning of 1915, when M. Briand\r\nrecommended it in principle. Besides, as anybody may convince himself,\r\nif the Pangerman plan had been fully known, it is highly probable that\r\nthe Allies would never have perpetrated the blunders which they have\r\ncommitted in the Balkans, the Dardanelles, and Serbia. It appears that\r\nthe magnitude of the Pangerman plan, and particularly the part which is\r\nmasked behind the pretended “drawn game,” has not even yet been clearly\r\napprehended in many circles which imagine themselves well acquainted\r\nwith the aims pursued by Germany in the war. In fact, quite recently,\r\nin France and in England, certain important organs, though not, it is\r\ntrue, of an official character, have argued that since Germany means to\r\nextend her _Zollverein_ to Austria-Hungary, the Allies ought to form a\r\npowerful economic league with the view of combatting the Austro-German\r\nunion _after the war_. But as we shall see, the question really could\r\nnot, except by some deplorable inadvertence, be stated in these terms\r\nin the Allied countries. No connexion should be voluntarily established\r\nby them between the economic union of the Allies, however natural it\r\nmay be, and the economic union of Central Europe. In truth, to permit\r\nthe future extension of the German _Zollverein_ to Austria-Hungary, in\r\nother words, to acquiesce in that economic alliance, under any form,\r\nbetween the two Central empires, which has formed the base and condition\r\nof the whole Pangerman plot for twenty-one years (the plot of 1895),\r\nwould be to permit implicitly the seizure by Germany of fifty millions\r\nof inhabitants, of whom nearly three-fourths are not Germans; the\r\ninevitable consequence, as I shall prove, would be to accept the German\r\nsupremacy over the Balkans and Turkey. Now it is manifest that such\r\nresults would be in absolute contradiction to the declarations of the\r\nAllied governments, which have proclaimed that their object in waging the\r\nwar has been to destroy Prussian militarism and not, consequently, to\r\nallow such a new state of things as the seizure, direct or indirect, of\r\nAustria-Hungary by Germany, which would multiply her power ten-fold.\r\n\r\nThe fact that such “inadvertences” can still be committed, after twenty\r\nmonths of war, in circles which, though not official, are nevertheless\r\nimportant, suffices to prove that the widest possible publicity of the\r\nPangerman plot throughout the great masses of the enlightened public in\r\nthe Allied countries is really needful, if not indispensable. It is also\r\nextremely desirable that neutrals should know exactly what the Pangerman\r\nplot is in its nature and in its extent. In particular, those Americans\r\nwho imagine that they can stand aloof from the present formidable\r\nconflict, will then clearly understand that their future liberty really\r\ndepends on the victory of the Allied soldiers, who are fighting not only\r\nfor their own independence, but in reality for the independence of the\r\nwhole civilized world, and particularly for that of the United States.\r\n\r\nI earnestly trust that the English edition of this book may contribute to\r\nbring about this result. Its object is to inform public opinion exactly,\r\nso far as the English tongue is spoken, as to the Berlin plot for the\r\ndomination of the globe. Moreover, an exact knowledge of the Pangerman\r\npolitical and military plot throws a flood of light on all the essential\r\nproblems of the war: it brings out the deep-seated cause of the war; it\r\nexplains the immediate causes, which are still almost unknown; it shows\r\nwhy it is indispensable to the freedom of the world that the Allies\r\nshould achieve, not a hollow and treacherous peace, but a complete\r\nvictory resulting in the destruction of Prussian militarism, which alone\r\ncan put an end to the great armaments in Europe and ensure a really\r\nlasting peace.\r\n\r\nIn order that the demonstration may be as convincing as possible, I shall\r\nrefrain, as far as I can, from giving my readers my own personal opinions\r\nand impressions. I shall do my utmost, above all, to lay before them\r\nexact documents and arguments intelligible to all, thus furnishing them\r\nwith facts which will enable them to form a judgment for themselves.\r\n\r\nIn any case, this work has no other aim than to speak the truth, and to\r\nserve a cause the justice of which will appear more and more manifest to\r\na world long deceived by the energetic and astute propaganda of Germany.\r\n\r\n    _5th August, 1916._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROLOGUE.\r\n\r\nPANGERMANISM AND WILLIAM II.\r\n\r\n    I. The Pangerman Doctrine.\r\n\r\n    II. The Kaiser as originator of the Pangerman plan.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Germans are truly methodical people. In every department of life\r\ntheir plans are based on a theory; it may be a true one or a false\r\none, but once they have conceived it they forge ahead with bull-dog\r\ntenacity. It is therefore necessary for us to grasp the exact meaning\r\nof the Pangerman doctrine, for the whole universal Pangerman plot, both\r\npolitical and military, springs from that tenet.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE POLES IN THE EAST OF GERMANY.]\r\n\r\nIt might be supposed that the expression Pangermanism embodies the theory\r\nin virtue of which the Germans claim to annex only the regions inhabited\r\nby dense masses of Germans, on the borders of the Empire, which, after\r\nall, would be in accordance with the principle of nationalities.\r\n\r\nBut Pangermanism has by no means such a restricted and legitimate aim.\r\nAgain, it might be thought that its object was to gather within the same\r\npolitical fold the peoples who are more or less Germanic by origin.\r\nSuch a claim would of itself be quite inadmissible. But Pangermanism is\r\nmore than that. It is really the doctrine, of purely Prussian origin,\r\nwhich aims at annexing all the various regions, irrespective of race or\r\nlanguage, of which the possession is deemed useful to the power of the\r\nHohenzollerns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DANES IN PRUSSIA.]\r\n\r\nIt was in the name of Pangermanism, a theory bred of cupidity and\r\nwanton greed, that Prussia charged the Parliament of Frankfort to\r\nclaim as German lands the Eastern Provinces, where in reality the Slavs\r\npredominate to such an extent, that they still contain a population of\r\nabout four million Poles.\r\n\r\nIt was in the name of Pangermanism that in 1864 Prussia seized that part\r\nof Schleswig which was entirely Danish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GERMANS AND THE NON-GERMANS IN AUSTRIA-HUNGARY.]\r\n\r\nIt is in the name of Pangermanism that Austria-Hungary has been for long\r\nthe object of German covetousness, although the Germans in that country\r\nare in a very small minority. Statistics show 12 millions of Germans\r\nagainst 38 millions of non-Germans, and that must be above the mark, for\r\nwe have to remember that German statistics systematically exaggerate the\r\nnumber of Germans dwelling in the Hapsburg Monarchy.\r\n\r\nAlready in 1859 the _Augsburg Gazette_ avowed the object of Germany’s\r\ndesigns on Austria with absolute cynicism:\r\n\r\n“We loudly declare that if Austria[1] were not a member of the\r\nConfederation; if it were not Austria who happened to be the legitimate\r\nowner of these non-German regions, it would be the duty of the German\r\nnation to conquer them at all costs, because they are absolutely\r\nnecessary for her development and for her position as a great power.”\r\n\r\nThe future Marshal von Moltke, also inspired by Pangermanism, had\r\nwritten, as far back as 1844: “We hope that Austria will uphold the\r\nrights and protect the future of the Danube lands, and that Germany will\r\nfinally succeed in keeping open the mouth of her great rivers” (see V.\r\nMoltke _Schriften_, t. II., p. 313).\r\n\r\nThe author of a pamphlet published in 1895, _i.e._ exactly twenty-one\r\nyears ago, inspired by this doctrine of fraud and protected by the\r\n_Alldeutscher Verband_, the most powerful Pangerman Society, after\r\nexpounding the main plan of future annexations, concludes with simple\r\neffrontery thus:\r\n\r\nNo doubt the newly-constituted Empires will not be peopled merely by\r\nGermans, but: “Germans alone will govern; they alone will exercise\r\npolitical rights; they alone will serve in the Army and in the Navy; they\r\nalone will have the right to become landowners; thus they will acquire\r\nthe conviction that, as in the Middle Ages, the Germans are a people of\r\nrulers. However, they will condescend so far as to delegate inferior\r\ntasks to foreign subjects subservient to Germany” (see _Grossdeutschland\r\nund Mitteleuropa um das Jahr_ 1950, published by Thormann und Goetsch,\r\nBerlin, p. 48).\r\n\r\nIdentity of race and language served for a long time to justify\r\nPangermanism; but the facts we have shown and the explicit declarations\r\nwe have quoted prove clearly that race and language were merely a pretext\r\nfor the diffusion of the Pangerman doctrine inspired by Prussia. If we\r\ndissect this doctrine we find it is composed of cupidity both political\r\nand economic. The truth is that Pangermanism is a scheme of piracy to\r\nbe carried on for the benefit of the Prussian monarchy. Its object is,\r\nby successive and indefinite expansions of territory to include within\r\nthe same boundaries, at first economic but afterwards political, such\r\nlands and such peoples as are likely to prove a profitable possession\r\nto the Hohenzollerns themselves and to their main support, the German\r\naristocracy.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, Pangermanism is a doctrine of international burglary, and\r\ntherefore it is exactly the reverse of the principle of nationality, that\r\nnoble idea ushered into the world by the French Revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nFrom the Pangerman doctrine the military and political Pangerman plot was\r\nbred and stage-managed by William II. Outside of Germany, the Kaiser was\r\nlooked upon, for a long time, as a peace-loving monarch. It is difficult\r\nto explain how such a very serious error could have arisen. Shortly after\r\nhis accession in 1888, William II. was secretly hatching that plot which\r\nso recently has caused the European conflagration, and subsequently, by\r\nhis public utterances, he has clearly showed his Pangerman tendencies.\r\n\r\nOn August 28th, 1898, in reply to the Burgomaster of Mayence’s speech,\r\nthe Kaiser declared that his wish was to keep inviolate the heritage\r\nbequeathed by his “immortal grandfather.” “But,” added William, “I\r\ncan only reach that goal if our authority firmly keeps sway over our\r\nneighbours. For this object the unity and the co-operation of every\r\nGerman tribe is required.” On the 4th October, 1900, William II., on\r\nlaying the foundation stone of the Roman Museum of Saalburg, again said:\r\n\r\n“May our German Fatherland become in the future as strongly united, as\r\npowerful, as wonderful as was the Roman universal empire; may this end be\r\nattained by the united co-operation of our princes, of our peoples, of\r\nour armies and of our citizens, in order that in the times to come it may\r\nbe said of us as it used to be said of yore: _Civis Romanus sum_.”\r\n\r\nOn the 28th October, 1900, speaking at an officers’ mess, William II.\r\naffirmed: “My highest aim is to remove whatever separates our great\r\nGerman people.” Now, in September, 1900, at Stettin, the Kaiser had just\r\ndeclared: “I have no fear of the future. I am convinced that my plan will\r\nprove successful.” In the Kaiser’s mind the whole matter was summed up in\r\nthe chief formula of Pangerman domination: _From Hamburg to the Persian\r\nGulf_. To accomplish this object the Kaiser had decided to forge closer\r\nand still closer links between Austria-Hungary and Germany. In order to\r\nconsolidate his supremacy over the Balkan peoples he reckoned on the\r\nco-operation of such of their Kings as were Germanic by origin (Bulgaria\r\nand Roumania), or on others who were strongly influenced by Germany—in\r\nreality by himself.\r\n\r\nThus he arranged the marriage of his own sister, Sophia, in 1889, with\r\nthe heir of the Throne of Greece, King Constantine of to-day. Finally,\r\nalmost immediately after his accession he had begun to think of showering\r\nhis Imperial favours on the Turks and the Musulmans; this was with the\r\nobject of seizing the Ottoman Empire, later on, and of making use of the\r\nMahometans of the whole world as a mighty lever against all other powers.\r\n\r\nOn November 8th, 1898, at Damascus, William II. pronounced the famous\r\nwords, the full significance of which is only made clear now that we\r\nhave seen the German action develop in Turkey and Persia, and that we\r\nhave learnt about William’s endeavours to cause an agitation among the\r\nMusulmans of Egypt, India and China:\r\n\r\n“May His Majesty the Sultan, as well as the three hundred millions of\r\nMusulmans who venerate him as their Khalifa, be assured that the German\r\nEmperor is their friend for ever.”\r\n\r\nThe adulation of the sanguinary Sultan Abdul-Hamid proved of practical\r\nuse to William II. He obtained on the 27th November, 1899, the first\r\nconcession of the Bagdad railway; now that railway, although still\r\nunfinished, has just been utilized by the German offensive both against\r\nRussia and England.\r\n\r\nAll over his Empire William II. had encouraged the formation of military\r\nand naval leagues—which number millions of members who, for the last\r\ntwenty years have carried on an incessant propaganda in favour of such\r\nGerman armaments by land and sea—as were wanted by the Kaiser.\r\n\r\nAgain, William II. encouraged the creation of the _Alldeutscher Verband_.\r\nThis association or Pangerman Union, counts among its members a large\r\nnumber of important and influential persons, and at the door of this\r\nsociety must be laid the most overwhelming responsibility for the\r\noutbreak of the war. Founded in 1894, it has organized thousands of\r\nlectures besides scattering broadcast millions of pamphlets to spread\r\nPangerman notions and to get the masses of the people to favour schemes\r\nof aggrandizement. It was due to the _Alldeutscher Verband_ that all\r\nthe Germans living outside the Empire were formed into a systematic\r\norganization for the present war; this being specially the case in\r\nAustria and in the United States.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to believe that such an autocrat as William II. had\r\nnot desired this end? How could three powerful associations, with\r\never-growing means of action, have carried on a most costly, as well as a\r\nmost violent propaganda, in a police-ridden country like Germany, unless\r\nthey had been approved of by the authorities usually so meddlesome or so\r\nvigilant?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs to the hour of the war, who set the clock going, if it were not the\r\nKaiser? As a matter of fact he put the hands of the dial forward (see\r\nChapter II).\r\n\r\nFrom November, 1913, onward, the Kaiser was busy preparing for early\r\nhostilities; he was aware that the enlargement of the Kiel Canal would be\r\ncomplete by July, 1914—therefore he arranged to be ready by that date,\r\nand as we know war was declared on August 1st, _i.e._, a few days after\r\nthe completion of the Kiel Canal. The Arch-Duke Francis-Ferdinand, the\r\nheir to the Austria-Hungarian throne, tempted by the Kaiser, is dazzled\r\nby the mirage of great profits which were to accrue from a joint action\r\nof the Central Powers. In April, 1914, the Kaiser goes on a visit to\r\nthe Archduke at Miramar, near Trieste. Again he meets him at Konopischt\r\nin June, 1914, and is then accompanied by von Tirpitz, that notorious\r\nChief of Pirates, that submarine Corsair. Now comes the right moment for\r\ndrafting the bold main lines of the combined action of the German and\r\nAustrian forces by land and sea. The murder of the Arch-Duke Ferdinand,\r\non June 28th, 1914, made no change in the Kaiser’s plans, it merely\r\nprecipitated events by furnishing an excellent pretext for intervention\r\nagainst Serbia. Thus the criminal action of the Kaiser stands revealed;\r\nfor twenty-five years he had been elaborating the Pangerman plan.\r\n\r\nAccording to Baron de Beyens, who before the war was Belgian Minister\r\nat Berlin, “it has been maintained that William II. was an unconscious\r\ntool in the hands of a caste and of a party who needed war in order to\r\nassert their own power. William has, indeed, listened to them, but he has\r\nlent them an ear because their designs chimed in with his own. In the\r\njudgment of history it is he who is doomed to bear the responsibility\r\nfor the disasters by which Europe has been overwhelmed” (Baron Beyens,\r\n_L’Allemagne avant la guerre_, p. 41, G. Van Oest, Paris).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor twenty-five years, and by order of the Kaiser, a violent Pangerman\r\npropaganda had been carried on throughout the Empire; therefore, let\r\nthere be no mistake, William II., in declaring war, was supported in his\r\ndecision, not only by the influential circles of German opinion, but\r\nby the large majority of the German people. A very notorious German,\r\nMaximilian Harden, has explicitly acknowledged this fact in his review\r\n_Zukunft_ of November, 1914:\r\n\r\n“This war has not been forced on us by surprise; we have desired it, and\r\nit was our bounden duty thus to desire it. Germany wages war because of\r\nher immutable conviction that greater world expansion and freer outlets\r\nare due to her by right of her own works” (quoted by _Le Temps_, 20th\r\nNovember, 1914).\r\n\r\nHaving thus formed and perfected for twenty years the Pangerman plot of\r\na European conflagration, William II. had the prodigious audacity to\r\ndeclare, in his Manifesto to the German people (August 1st, 1915), after\r\ndrenching Europe with streams of blood for a whole year: “Before God and\r\nbefore History, I swear that my conscience is clear. I did not desire\r\nwar.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE PANGERMAN PLAN.\r\n\r\n    I. The Pangerman plan of 1911.\r\n\r\n    II. The stages by which it has been effected.\r\n\r\n    III. Why it has been ignored.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nThe Pangerman plot in its broad outlines was laid as early as 1895,\r\nbut since that date events have happened throughout the world, which\r\nencouraged Pangermans to enlarge the structure of their scheme.\r\n\r\nIn 1898 the Fashoda incident almost caused a breach between France and\r\nEngland. In 1905 Japan compelled Russia to sign peace after a long war\r\nwhich exhausted all the Tsar’s military resources and disturbed the\r\nbalance of power in Europe for a long time to the advantage of Germany.\r\nIn 1909 the Vienna Government, under cover of the veiled ultimatum\r\nwhich Berlin sent to the Tsar, carried out the annexation of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, countries which are almost entirely peopled by Serbians.\r\nThis seizure of a huge Slav territory was a great triumph for Germanism.\r\nOn November 3rd, 1910, at the Potsdam meeting, the Kaiser obtained\r\nfrom the Tsar’s Government the abandonment of all opposition to the\r\ncompletion of the Bagdad railway. England and France took up the same\r\nattitude. On July 1st, 1911, the Kaiser ventured on the Agadir episode,\r\nwhich was clearly an attempt to force a quarrel on France. It led to\r\nthe Franco-German treaty of November 4th, 1911, which ceded to Germany\r\n275,000 square kilometres of the French Congo, while at the same time the\r\ncommerce of Morocco was heavily mortgaged in favour of Germany.\r\n\r\nThese various events deeply injured the interests of France, England and\r\nRussia; but these powers preferred to submit to the hardest sacrifices\r\nrather than undertake the dreadful responsibility of letting loose a\r\nfearful war on Europe. The Pangermans misread this attitude as a sign of\r\nweakness, and of a desire to keep the peace at all costs; and accordingly\r\nthey were encouraged to entertain high hopes of huge success in a near\r\nfuture. That is why the original Pangerman plan of 1895, considerably\r\naltered, became the perfected plan of 1911.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PANGERMAN PLAN OF 1911.]\r\n\r\nThis plan of 1911 (_see map_) provided in Europe and in Western Asia:\r\n\r\n1º.

The absolute subordination of the Balkan countries (containing\r\n499,275 square kilometres and 22 millions of non-Germans) to the Great\r\nCentral European Confederation. The Balkan States to become mere\r\nsatellites of Berlin.\r\n\r\n3º. Germany’s political and military seizure of Turkey, which was\r\nafterwards to be enlarged by the annexation of Egypt and Persia. It was\r\nprovided that Turkey should be dealt with in two successive stages.\r\nDuring the first, the handful of “Young Turks” who have ruled the Ottoman\r\nEmpire since 1908, and who play the German game, were to remain in power\r\nmerely as figure-heads. Turkey was to retain a nominal independence\r\nduring this phase, though in reality she was to have been tied to\r\nGermany by a treaty of military alliance. Under pretence of effecting\r\nreforms, numerous German officials were to be placed at the head of\r\nall the Ottoman administrations, and that would have paved the way for\r\nthe second stage. The latter had for its aim the putting of Turkey,\r\nwith her 1,792,000 square kilometres and her 20 millions of non-German\r\ninhabitants, under the strict protectorate of Germany, to say nothing of\r\nthe subject provinces, Egypt and Persia.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Germanic Confederation of Central Europe was to form a huge\r\n_Zollverein_ or Customs Union. Treaties of Commerce of a special\r\ncharacter imposed on the Balkan States and on subjected Turkey would\r\nhave provided for Great Germany an economic outlet and reserved for her\r\nexclusively those vast regions.\r\n\r\nFinally, we can sum up the Pangerman plan of 1911 in four formulas:\r\n\r\nBerlin—Calais; Berlin—Riga; Hamburg—Salonika; Hamburg—Persian Gulf.\r\n\r\nThe union of the three groupings—Central Europe, Balkan States and\r\nTurkey—would have placed under the predominating influence of Berlin\r\n4,015,146 square kilometres and 204 millions of inhabitants, of whom 127\r\nmillions were to be ruled directly or indirectly by merely 77 millions of\r\nGermans.\r\n\r\nThis continental Pangerman plan of 1911 was to have been completed by\r\ncolonial conquests of great magnitude, of which an account is given at\r\nthe end of Chapter V.\r\n\r\nWilliam II. was well aware that such a project could only become an\r\nenduring reality if all other great powers disappeared from the face\r\nof the earth. The Kaiser had therefore positively resolved, when\r\nhatching his Pangerman plot, to accomplish the destruction of five great\r\npowers. It is necessary to grasp fully this fundamental truth, if we\r\nwish to understand the nature of the present war. It was foreseen that\r\nAustria-Hungary would disappear by her absorption under cover of entrance\r\ninto the German _Zollverein_. France and Russia were to have been\r\ntotally ruined by means of a furious preventive war which would entirely\r\ndestroy their military forces. England was to be put out of action by\r\na subsequent operation, which would have been an easy matter when once\r\nFrance and Russia had been dismembered and reduced to utter impotence.\r\nAs to Italy—destined to become a vassal state—she was not considered\r\nas being capable of hindering in the least the Pangerman ambitions.\r\nOne of the Kaiser’s agents for propagating this scheme wrote in 1900:\r\n“Italy cannot be looked upon as a rival for she is too incompetent in\r\nwarfare” (_Deutschland bei Beginn des 20 Jahrhunderts_, p. 53. Military\r\npublishers, R. Felix, Berlin, 1900).\r\n\r\nIt must be added that the Pangerman plot of 1911 did not include war\r\nwith England. When he declared hostilities in August, 1914, William II.\r\nwas convinced that England would take no share in them, at least not\r\nimmediately. The Kaiser had laid every conceivable kind of trap to add\r\nfuel to the flames of all internal English disturbances and to deceive\r\nthe London Cabinet. At one moment he almost succeeded in his endeavours.\r\nEngland’s decision to participate without delay in the struggle only\r\nhung by a thread, but that thread was broken. If England had tarried,\r\nif she had tarried only for a few days, German landings in Normandy,\r\nBrittany, and as far as Bordeaux would have been effected. France being\r\nthus rendered quickly powerless on all sides, the English intervention\r\nwould have proved futile at a later stage, and the Pangerman plan of\r\n1911 would thus have been fully achieved. But in going to war just at\r\nthe right moment and in controlling the sea, Great Britain has, while\r\nsaving herself, furnished to civilized humanity the means of avoiding the\r\nPrussian yoke. The initial German plan has truly been upset by English\r\nintervention following on the respite gained by the splendid resistance\r\nof Belgium in arms.\r\n\r\nBut the Germans are clever, they are stubborn and crafty. Adapting\r\nthemselves to new conditions thrust on them, they are still endeavouring\r\nto make an enormous profit out of the war. We must, therefore, try to\r\nunderstand what operations they have devised for carrying out, even now,\r\nthe Pangerman plot almost in its entirety.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nAs it is necessary to open the eyes of neutrals, many of whom have been\r\nmisled by the German propaganda, we must try to expose very clearly the\r\ninner workings of the Pangerman plot as it is revealed to us in the\r\nsearchlight of facts.\r\n\r\nFrom 1892 down to the outbreak of the War, that is to say, for twenty-two\r\nyears, the Pangerman movement has developed with ever growing intensity;\r\na multitude of publications, giving full details of the plan, were\r\nscattered among the German people, in order to excite in them the greed\r\nof conquest and so prepare them for the struggle through the allurement\r\nof plunder. Of these publications two are of special importance: first,\r\nthe pamphlet published under the auspices of the _Alldeutscher Verband_:\r\nnamely, _Grossdeutschland und Mitteleuropa um das Jahr 1950_ (Thormann\r\nund Goetsch, Berlin, 1895), which gives the Pangerman plan of 1895:\r\nsecond, the book of Otto Richard Tannenberg: _Grossdeutschland, die\r\nArbeit des 20ᵗᵉⁿ Jahrhunderts_ (Bruno Volger, Leipzig-Gohlis, 1911),\r\nwhich gives all suitable details of the plan of 1911.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, although this Pangerman literature is very considerable,\r\nfull of documentary evidence and spread broadcast among the masses by\r\nmost powerful associations, whose patrons are the highest authorities\r\nin the land, few people outside of Germany would believe in its extreme\r\nimportance. But now the facts speak for themselves. The reality, the\r\nextent, and the successive stages of the Pangerman plan of 1911 are shown\r\nby:\r\n\r\n1º. The course which Germany has taken since August 1st, 1914, in her\r\npolitical and military operations which have for their object not, as\r\nmany have supposed, the obtaining of securities, but the annexation of\r\nterritories in the manner set forth in Tannenberg’s book, and more or\r\nless in accordance with the plan of 1911.\r\n\r\n2º. The memorial delivered on May 20th, 1915, to the German Chancellor\r\nby the League of Agriculturists, the League of German Peasants, the\r\nProvisional Association of Christian German Peasants, now called the\r\nWestphalian Peasants’ Association, the Central German Manufacturers’\r\nUnion, the League of Manufacturers, and the Middle-Class Union of the\r\nEmpire (_see_ _Le Temps_, 12th August, 1915). The importance of this\r\ndocument cannot be overrated, for it is issued by the most powerful\r\nassociations of the Empire, including all the influential elements of\r\nthe German nation, specially the agrarians and the iniquitous Prussian\r\nsquires. Now the purport of that memorial, as will be shown, is to\r\ndemand all such annexations mentioned in the Pangerman plan of 1911, as\r\nthe development of military operations has so far rendered feasible.\r\nAny one who knows Germany can hardly doubt that this memorial was not\r\nhanded in to Bethmann-Hollweg without a previous understanding with him.\r\nDoubtless it was intended that this document should seem to exercise an\r\novermastering pressure of public opinion on William II.’s government.\r\nBut if the ideas expressed in this memorial reflect, as they certainly\r\ndo, the wishes of influential German circles, it is also unquestionable\r\nthat they correspond very closely to the scheme of aggrandizement, which\r\nWilliam II. has been nursing for over twenty years.\r\n\r\n3º. The declarations made at the sitting of the Reichstag of the 11th\r\nDecember, 1915, prove the exactitude of this statement. The Imperial\r\nChancellor said:\r\n\r\n“If our enemies will not submit now, they will be obliged to do so\r\nlater on.... When our enemies shall offer us such peace proposals as\r\nare compatible with the dignity and security of Germany we shall be\r\nready to discuss them.... But our enemies must understand that the more\r\nunrelentingly they wage war, the higher will be the guarantees exacted.”\r\n\r\nBethmann-Hollweg could hardly have spoken more explicitly, but his\r\ndiplomatic game was naturally to unmask Germany’s enormous pretensions\r\nonly bit by bit, in order that the eyes of neutrals should not be opened\r\nto the Pangerman monster in all its horror until the last moment. But\r\nhardly had the Chancellor finished his speech than the Deputy Spahn\r\nexplained the real drift of it with great precision:\r\n\r\n“We await,” said Herr Spahn, “the hour which will allow of peace\r\nnegotiations which will safeguard in a permanent way and by all means,\r\nincluding the needful territorial annexations, all military economic and\r\npolitical interests of Germany in its total extent.”\r\n\r\nThe thundering applause which greeted these words proves that they echoed\r\nthe sentiments of the overwhelming majority of the German deputies, who\r\nat that moment still believed that it was possible for Germany to achieve\r\nenormous annexations.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of the Pangerman plan has required for over twenty\r\nyears a huge propaganda among the German masses as well as a world-wide\r\norganization. How is it that this plan has been ignored in its nature\r\nand in its extent by the diplomats of France, England and Russia? Such,\r\nhowever, has been the case, for otherwise the war could not have come\r\nupon these three powers as a surprise. We deal here with a matter which\r\nat first sight seems improbable and which, therefore, needs explanation.\r\n\r\nThe diplomatic agents of the Allies are certainly not inferior personally\r\nto those of William II., but the Kaiser’s foreign service, as a whole,\r\nincludes novel instruments of observation and influence by which,\r\nfor the last twenty years, the Government of Berlin has seconded its\r\nofficial diplomacy without allowing the connexion between it and them\r\nto transpire. None of the Allied countries have employed similar\r\ninstruments, the result being that the Entente is considerably inferior\r\nin this department of foreign policy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Pangerman plan is founded on a very exact knowledge of all political,\r\nethnographical, economic, social, military and naval problems, not\r\nonly of Europe, but of the whole world; the Germans have acquired that\r\nknowledge by means of an intense labour of over twenty-five years. But\r\nthis task has not been performed by the official German diplomats; it has\r\nbeen carried out either by the members of the _Alldeutscher Verband_, the\r\nPangerman Union, or by the agents of the German secret service, which\r\nhas been enormously extended. These agents might be called connecting\r\nlinks between the regular spies and the official diplomats; Baron von\r\nSchenk, who worked at Athens from 1915-1916, is a sample of that category\r\nof agents who have studied methodically all the root questions of the\r\nPangerman plan, who have prepared means to delude the minds of neutrals,\r\nto paralyze the revolt of the Slavs in Austria-Hungary, to corrupt all\r\nsuch neutral individuals or neutral newspapers as were susceptible of\r\ncorruption, etc. After these numerous agents had made their reports,\r\nand when once these had been examined and summarized, they were sent to\r\nthe Wilhelmstrasse, to the great German General Staff, whose concerted\r\noperations are always so combined as to answer both to political and\r\nto military needs. At the same time the reports reached William II.’s\r\nprivate study, and his brain was thus able to store up all technical\r\nmeans necessary for the achievement of his plan of domination.\r\n\r\nWas the diplomatic corps of the Allies so well served that it could\r\ngrasp in its universal significance the immense work of preparation\r\naccomplished by the secret Pangerman agents? Indeed, they were not\r\nproperly supplied with the right tools for such a task, and we shall see\r\nwhy it was so.\r\n\r\nFirst of all it is necessary to dispel a false notion which “the man in\r\nthe street” has of diplomacy. He fondly thinks that diplomats, while\r\npreparing clever and mysterious combinations, fashion History. Now the\r\nexperience of centuries shows that as a general rule diplomats merely\r\nchronicle History but do not make it. My teacher, Albert Sorel, neatly\r\nexpressed that truth by saying: “Diplomats are History’s attorneys.”\r\nIn fact, the diplomacy of any country helps to prepare and to fashion\r\nhistory only when there happens to be at its head a great man of large\r\nand just ideas, who knows how to apply these ideas by all the means\r\navailable in his time.\r\n\r\nIt is a strange fact and worthy of notice, that such a great man is\r\nrarely, if ever, a professional diplomat. For example, Richelieu,\r\nNapoleon, Palmerston, Disraeli, Cavour, Bismarck, who all prepared and\r\nfashioned History, were not trained diplomatists. Unfortunately, it does\r\nnot seem that Fortune has endowed any of our Allied countries, either\r\nbefore or since the war, with a head capable of leading, on grand lines,\r\nthe diplomatic affairs of the Entente. The latter therefore has been only\r\nserved by those diplomats who are mere officials, and who as such await\r\ninstructions from higher quarters, and these instructions are very often\r\nfound wanting.\r\n\r\nBesides, the diplomacy of the Allies, not being seconded, like that of\r\nGermany, by novel means of observation, can only obtain the information\r\nit needs by methods still so old-fashioned that they are almost identical\r\nwith those used a century ago. They are totally inadequate to point out\r\nthe sequence of ideas or the rapid development of events which in Central\r\nEurope and the Balkans have been, as will be seen, the immediate causes\r\nof the war; nor are the means employed by our diplomats at all sufficient\r\nif they wish to recognize what forms the whole chain of the Pangerman\r\norganization. Just because this organization is huge, just because it is\r\nso complex, its total importance cannot be properly gauged unless the\r\nconnecting links between the varied elements are clearly perceived.\r\n\r\nThe typical professional diplomat lives in a world of his own. Either\r\nhis information comes from the office or it is second-hand; it rarely is\r\nreached by direct observation of people or facts. The secretaries at the\r\nEmbassies divide their time between office work, copying documents in\r\ncopper plate hand, or social functions, pleasant enough but confined to\r\na particular and narrow set. Few of the secretaries know the language of\r\nthe country in which they reside, fewer still travel in the interior of\r\nthe land in order to study it.\r\n\r\nThe events which have led to the European conflagration spring from\r\ntwo main causes: the stupendous scope of the German ambitions and the\r\nprogress of the Austro-Hungarian and Balkan nationalities. Now both these\r\nfactors have been revealed on many occasions, by purely local events\r\nwhich, to a keen observer, would have betrayed most significantly the end\r\nin view, but they have occurred for the most part in places far removed\r\nfrom capital cities, and to appreciate fully their importance would have\r\nneeded direct observation on the spot.\r\n\r\nThis is quite contrary to the tradition followed by official diplomats.\r\nThose of the Entente had not, at their disposal, agents who could go\r\nand, for instance, hear the numerous lectures given by the Pangerman\r\npropaganda, and who could have procured and translated for them the\r\nilluminating pamphlets of the _Alldeutscher Verband_. Also they had no\r\nmeans of getting into personal touch with the party leaders, either Slav\r\nor Latin, of Austria-Hungary; often these leaders were men without a\r\nplace in parliament, frequently without fortune or social rank; all they\r\nhad was their national ideal, their strength of conviction, but they were\r\nreal and novel forces, for they acted on the popular masses with whom\r\nthey were in complete intellectual sympathy.\r\n\r\nAs the diplomatic corps of the Entente was not provided with that\r\nindispensable aid—an organization of secondary agents of observation—they\r\nhave been reduced to accept information of a superficial and incomplete\r\nnature. Often it was merely provided by press cuttings and even those\r\nwere frequently from papers written in a tongue which the diplomats\r\ncould not read; at best these cuttings were without any connecting link\r\nand quite insufficient to warn them of the approach of a great peril.\r\nWe must add that in diplomatic circles of all periods—unless they are\r\nled by some eminent man—there are certain formulas current, such as: “No\r\nfuss,” “it is necessary to wait and see,” “we must not believe that it\r\nhas happened,” which have had a baneful influence. The result has been\r\na sceptical attitude which in diplomatical circles passes for essential\r\nand in good taste. If we add to this frame of mind the absence of varied,\r\ndirect and coherent information, we can understand how it was that before\r\nthe war, when any one tried to persuade a professional diplomatist that\r\nWilliam II.’s political aim was nothing short of the establishment\r\nof German supremacy over the whole world, he was soon set down as a\r\nvisionary with a head stuffed full of groundless suspicions.\r\n\r\nFinally, we must realize that the system by which a diplomat is sent from\r\npillar to post, often to the antipodes, every four or five years, is not\r\nconducive to the acquirement of a general and exact knowledge, founded\r\non documentary evidence, of events still in progress, in a wide zone, so\r\ncomplex and so difficult to study as Central Europe and the Balkans.\r\n\r\nThese various considerations help us to understand why, during the\r\ntwenty-five years which preceded the war, no diplomat of the Allies\r\nhas been able to grasp the total Pangerman plan in its nature and in\r\nits extent, though possibly a few of them may have indicated in their\r\nreports now and then some local Pangerman act which aroused suspicion.\r\nThese considerations explain also, at least in part, the failure of the\r\ndiplomatic corps of the Entente in the Balkans.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo sum up, allied official diplomats are not personally inferior to\r\nGerman official diplomats, but the latter have an enormous advantage\r\nover their colleagues of the Entente in knowing the general plan of the\r\nBerlin policy, in knowing, each in his own post, in what direction to\r\nproceed and what must be done or prevented in order to attain the final\r\nend. During the last twenty-five years the Kaiser’s foreign policy has\r\nbeen constructive and framed on a definite plan, while the diplomats of\r\nthe Allies, reflecting the policy of their Governments without concrete\r\nplans, have been hampered, because they believed obstinately in Peace, in\r\na vague and stagnant defensive. On the other hand, the allied diplomacy,\r\nregarded as an instrument of observation, confined to old-fashioned\r\nmethods, is like an ordinary magnifying glass which shows nothing but\r\nthe largest objects. On the contrary, the German foreign policy, thanks\r\nto the new, busy and secret organs, by which the German diplomacy has\r\nbeen seconded, may be compared to a workshop provided with powerful\r\nmicroscopes by which facts can be studied not only in their general\r\naspect, but also in their most minute details, details which often are\r\nnot without their importance.\r\n\r\nFinally, the allied diplomacy, regarded as an instrument of action, still\r\nclinging to antiquated traditional methods, may be compared to an army\r\nwhich possesses only field guns, while the foreign diplomacy of Germany,\r\nin its totality, is comparable to an army equipped both with heavy and\r\nwith field artillery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE CAUSES OF THE WAR.\r\n\r\n    I. Why the Treaty of Bukarest suddenly raised a formidable\r\n    obstacle to the Pangerman plan.\r\n\r\n    II. How it was that the internal state of Austria-Hungary drove\r\n    Germany to let loose the dogs of war.\r\n\r\n    III. General view of the causes of the war.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the Pangerman plan is unquestionably the chief ultimate cause of\r\nthe war, yet when William II. started it in August, 1914, he did so for\r\nnearer and for secondary reasons which we must examine carefully if we\r\nwish to have a clear view of events.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nUp to 1911, when Tannenberg published the programme of annexations, all\r\nprevious great events had favoured William II.’s aims; but from 1912\r\nonward events suddenly raised very serious and quite unexpected obstacles\r\nto the execution of the Pangerman plan.\r\n\r\nIn 1912, Italy conquered Libya at the cost of Turkey and against\r\nthe will and pleasure of Berlin. Again in 1912 Greece, Montenegro,\r\nSerbia and Bulgaria became united against the Ottoman Empire; this\r\nalso was contrary to the will and pleasure of Berlin. What was quite\r\nunexpected by the Kaiser’s Staff was the victory of the Balkan peoples\r\nover the Turks. As Germany had upheld the latter she felt profoundly\r\nhumiliated. Then, in order to hinder the foundation of an efficient\r\nBalkanic Confederation—that is, one constituted on the principle of\r\na fair balance—Vienna, and above all, Berlin, used as their tool the\r\nTsar Ferdinand’s well-known ambition to establish Bulgarian supremacy\r\nin the peninsula. Accordingly instigated by the Germanic powers, the\r\nBulgarians in June, 1913, attacked their allies, the Serbians and Greeks.\r\nBut once more the Kaiser’s calculations were upset. Roumania, escaping\r\nfor the first time from German leading strings, intervened against\r\nBulgaria, which was struggling with her former allies, and thus Bulgaria\r\nwas vanquished. Now, the new condition of things which arose from the\r\nBukarest treaty of August 10th, 1913, suddenly formed a formidable\r\nobstacle to the Pangerman scheme in the East, and this is the reason:\r\n\r\nThe treaty of Bukarest created in the peninsula two groups of states\r\nsharply opposed to each other. The first was formed of the beaten and\r\nsullen participants in the Balkan wars, Bulgaria and Turkey. The second\r\ngroup was composed of those peoples who had benefited by the wars and\r\nwere satisfied with the result, to wit, Roumania, Serbia, Montenegro and\r\nGreece. These four last states, seeing that their vital interests had\r\nbecome closely bound together by the territorial annexations made at\r\nthe cost of the common enemy, had joined all their forces to insure the\r\nmaintenance of the Bukarest treaty which they considered inviolable.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, this sharp division of the Balkan States into two\r\ngroups whose interests were diametrically opposed, reacted deeply on\r\ngeneral European politics. The force of events led the conquered states\r\nof 1912 and 1913, Turkey and Bulgaria, to support Germanism in the\r\nBalkans; on the contrary, Roumania, as well as Serbia, Montenegro and\r\nGreece, because of their recent acquisitions, were leaning more and more\r\ntowards the Triple Entente, quite contrary to the views of Berlin and at\r\nthe cost of Turkey, which even then was bound hand and foot to Germany.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ANTIGERMANIC BARRIER IN THE BALKANS AFTER THE TREATY\r\nOF BUKAREST (10TH AUGUST, 1913).]\r\n\r\nPrevious to the Balkan wars the Triple Entente enjoyed an influence in\r\nthe peninsula, vastly inferior to that of Germany; after the treaty of\r\nBukarest, however, the Entente found support in that group of states\r\nwhich was most powerfully organized and which presented (see map) a very\r\nsolid barrier to the accomplishment of Pangerman designs in the East.\r\n\r\nThis new order of things lashed Berlin into a fury which though outwardly\r\nrestrained was none the less intense because the only group (Turkey and\r\nBulgaria) which was still under German influence, was bound to remain\r\nfor a very long time to come practically impotent and powerless to make\r\nsingly any attempt against the other group which favoured the Entente.\r\n\r\nIndeed, Turkey, which in her defeats had lost almost the whole of her\r\nmilitary stores, could hardly, at the beginning of 1914, put 250,000 men\r\nunder arms. Her financial difficulties were such that, if left to her own\r\nresources, it would have taken her many years to replace her military\r\npower on a solid basis.\r\n\r\nBulgaria was in a similar financial predicament. Besides, if she had\r\ntaken action it would have been at great risk to herself, in as much as\r\nthose states which profited by the Bukarest Treaty (Roumania, Serbia and\r\nGreece), surrounding as they do (see the arrows of the map) Bulgaria on\r\nthree sides, could then have delivered a concentric attack on Sofia.\r\n\r\nFinally, great was the disproportion of men eligible for the army or\r\ncapable of bearing arms between the two groups.\r\n\r\n    +------------------------+-------------------------+\r\n    |   Germanophile Group.  |  Group of the Entente.  |\r\n    |                        |                         |\r\n    | Turkey         250,000 | Greece          400,000 |\r\n    | Bulgaria       550,000 | Serbia          400,000 |\r\n    |                        | Montenegro       50,000 |\r\n    |                        | Roumania        600,000 |\r\n    |                ------- |               --------- |\r\n    |                800,000 |               1,450,000 |\r\n    +------------------------+-------------------------+\r\n\r\nThese figures, taken in conjunction with the geographical situation, show\r\nclearly that, left to its own resources, the Germanophile group could\r\nattempt no attack on the Entente group.\r\n\r\nThe new balance of military forces in the Balkans which was the outcome\r\nof the Bukarest treaty, therefore reduced almost to naught Germany’s\r\npower of intrigue in the Peninsula.\r\n\r\nHad peace reigned for a few years, the new Balkan situation would have\r\nbeen consolidated and the obstacle to Pangerman ambition in the East\r\nwould have been still more serious. It was for these varied reasons that\r\nBerlin decided to intervene directly. Without doubt Serbia was the pivot\r\non which turned the new Balkanic equilibrium. It was therefore decided\r\nto destroy her without delay, kindling at the same time the European\r\nconflagration, and thus by one single blow to accomplish the plan of 1911.\r\n\r\nThe Bukarest treaty was signed on the tenth of August, 1913. On November\r\n6th, 1913, King Albert of Belgium was at Potsdam, and the Kaiser said to\r\nhim that in his opinion war with France was near and unavoidable (see\r\nBaron Beyen’s _L’Allemagne avant la Guerre_, p. 24).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom this survey it follows that, if the treaty of Bukarest, through its\r\nconsequences, proved disastrous to the Pangerman aims, it was, on the\r\ncontrary, extremely advantageous to the powers of the Triple Entente, for\r\nit brought to their side the majority of the Balkanic forces.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the diplomacy of the Entente had not even a notion how\r\nfavourable the situation was to them. This ignorance was due to the\r\nold-fashioned methods of observation still used by diplomats which\r\nprevented them from believing in the Pangerman scheme, and which also\r\nhindered them from entertaining general and correct views of the varied\r\nproblems which form such a tangle in that large territorial zone. Indeed,\r\nthough one of the immediate causes of the war was Germany’s wish to\r\nupset the Bukarest treaty, because the consequences of that treaty\r\nruined the Pangerman aims in the East, the Triple Entente powers were\r\nno sooner at war with Germany than they did all in their power during\r\nten months to cancel in like manner the consequences of the Bukarest\r\ntreaty; for that was in fact the result of the Entente’s ingenuous wish\r\nto satisfy Bulgaria at all costs. Theoretically, the attempt inspired\r\nby the noble thought of avoiding the horrors of war in the Balkans, was\r\njust, but in practice it was an impossibility owing to the fierce hatred\r\nthe Bulgarians entertain towards their conquerors of 1913, and above all\r\ntowards the Serbians.\r\n\r\nWhat is certain is that the diplomacy of the Allies, during the first\r\nyear of war, followed such a policy in the Balkans that, evidently\r\nwithout knowing it, they played entirely into the hands of Berlin.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nNot only were the consequences of the Bukarest treaty disastrous to\r\nPangerman ambitions in the Balkan peninsula, they also, to the boundless\r\nfury of William II., considerably accelerated that internal political\r\nevolution of Austria-Hungary which of itself had already threatened to\r\nupset all his plans.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the notions held about Austria-Hungary in France, and above\r\nall, in England, have far too long been of a very vague nature. Public\r\nopinion in France and England was totally unable to grasp the situation,\r\nwhen war broke out. It was incapable of seeing the important part played\r\nduring the war, and to be played after the war, by the populations living\r\nin the Hapsburg Monarchy. The vast majority of these peoples devoutly\r\npray for the victory of the Triple Entente, for they only fight against\r\nit because they are forcibly constrained to do so. At heart they look\r\nto the victory of the Allies for deliverance from a hateful yoke which\r\nhas weighed on them heavily for centuries. That is why it is of the\r\nutmost importance to educate public opinion in the allied countries as\r\nto the actual racial facts in Austria-Hungary. Then it will be clearly\r\nunderstood of what abominable treason Francis Joseph was guilty against\r\nhis peoples; then it will be clearly understood also that as these\r\npeoples were more and more inclined, before the war, to lean to the side\r\nof France and England, quite as much as to that of Russia, William II.\r\nhad a strong additional motive for precipitating hostilities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NATIONALITIES IN AUSTRIA-HUNGARY.]\r\n\r\nThe nine different nationalities who live in the Hapsburg Monarchy can be\r\ndivided into four races:\r\n\r\n            _Germanic._              _Magyar._\r\n\r\n    Germans   12,000,000      Magyars             10,000,000\r\n                              (peculiar race of\r\n                              Asiatic origin)\r\n\r\n            _Latin._                  _Slav._\r\n\r\n    Italians   1,000,000      { Czecks and Slovak  8,500,000\r\n    Roumanian  3,000,000      { Poles              5,000,000\r\n                              { Ruthenes           3,500,000\r\n                              { Slovenes           1,000,000\r\n                              { Serbo-Croats       6,000,000\r\n               ---------                          ----------\r\n               4,000,000                          24,000,000\r\n\r\nIn a political sense the Germans and Magyars, forming a total of 22\r\nmillions, have agreed since 1867 to exercise and maintain for their own\r\nprofit the supremacy over the Slavs and Latins, although these latter\r\nform the majority of the subjects of the Monarchy, since they constitute\r\na group of 28 million inhabitants.\r\n\r\nNow, it is needful to note and it is important to remember, that the\r\nfigures which I quote, are incorrect, because they are those furnished by\r\nthe Government statistics at Vienna and at Budapest by German and Magyar\r\nofficials. These have their instructions to use various artful tricks\r\nfor falsifying systematically the true statistics in favour of their own\r\nraces, in order to contribute by that stratagem to the maintenance, as\r\nlong as possible, of the supremacy held by the Germans and the Magyars.\r\nIn truth, there are in Austria-Hungary far less than 22 million Germans\r\nand Magyars, and far more than 28 Slavs and Latins. What again is\r\ncertain, is that for centuries the Slavs and Latins have been oppressed\r\nin Austria-Hungary in the most odious fashion by a feudal aristocracy,\r\nwho engross enormous landed properties, and who exercise in the Hapsburg\r\nMonarchy as baneful a social influence as that of the _Junkers_ in\r\nPrussia.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the Polish aristocracy of Galicia and a small group\r\nof Ruthenes, who since 1867 joined hands with the Germans, all these\r\nSlavs and Latins have been endeavouring to the very utmost, especially\r\nfor the last thirty years, to obtain, in accordance with modern justice,\r\nsuch political rights as are proportionate to their numbers. In that way\r\nthey hope to win for themselves in the Monarchy the legal majority that\r\nis their due, by reason of their being human flesh and blood liable to be\r\ntaxed and to be called on for service at the will of the Government.\r\n\r\nThese tendencies have long excited extreme alarm in William II. and his\r\nPangermans. This is readily understood, for, if the political power, in\r\nthe Hapsburg Monarchy, were vested, as justice demands, in the Slavs and\r\nLatins, who hate Prussianism, that in itself would have been the ruin of\r\nthe Kaiser’s plan for the economic absorption of Austria-Hungary. Yet\r\nthis very absorption is indispensable to William II. if he is to carry\r\nout his inadmissible plans of exclusive influence in the Balkans and in\r\nthe East. His game has therefore been, especially since 1890, to say,\r\nin the main, to Francis Joseph and to the Magyars: “Above all, do not\r\nconcede the claims of your Slav and Latin subjects. Keep up absolutely\r\nthe Germano-Magyar supremacy. I will uphold you, with all my power,\r\nin your struggle with the Slav-Latin elements.” For a long time these\r\ntactics of the Kaiser were successful but they were on the point of\r\nbreaking down a short time before the war.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the most ingenious and cynical obstacles raised by the\r\nGermans and Magyars the culture of the Slavs and Latins kept growing;\r\ntheir national organizations kept progressing; also they were much more\r\nprolific than their political rivals. All these conditions together gave\r\nFrancis Joseph and his henchmen at Budapest increasing trouble in their\r\nefforts to resist the enlarged demands of their Latin and Slav subjects.\r\nBerlin had already become anxious on that score, when the mental\r\neffervescence stirred up among the Slavs and Latins of Austria-Hungary\r\nby the result of the Bukarest treaty suddenly changed for the worse the\r\noutlook of the Pangerman scheme.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, almost the whole of the 28 million Slav and Latin\r\nsubjects of the Hapsburgs had been roused to enthusiasm by the victories\r\nof the Slavs in the Balkans in 1912, and by the success of Roumania\r\nin 1913; for they saw, above all, in these events, the triumph of the\r\nprinciple of nationality, that is, their very own cause. Hence they\r\nbecame more than ever determined in their endeavours to obtain from\r\nVienna and Budapest those political rights, proportionate to their\r\nnumber, which the Germano-Magyars persisted in refusing, although of late\r\nyears that refusal had lost much of its energy.\r\n\r\nIf peace had been maintained, the effect of the Bukarest treaty on\r\nAustria-Hungary would have lent irresistible force to the claims of the\r\nSlav and Latin subjects of Francis Joseph. On the other hand, Roumania,\r\nexulting in her annexation of the Bulgarian Dobrudja, cast longing eyes\r\non Transylvania, and hoped to secure it at the expense of Hungary. The\r\nmoment appeared opportune when a thorough transformation of the Hapsburg\r\nMonarchy might be effected, and that transformation seemed relatively so\r\nnear that Roumania already looked upon Transylvania as a ripe fruit which\r\nmerely needed gathering.\r\n\r\nIf this new order of things resulting from the treaty of Bukarest had\r\nbeen allowed to develop fully, the influence of Germanism would have\r\nbeen infallibly ruined in the Hapsburg Monarchy, just as had happened in\r\nthe Balkans. Under the growing pressure of her Slav and Latin elements\r\nthe partition, or at any rate, the evolution towards federation of\r\nAustria-Hungary would have become a necessity. This federalism would\r\nnot have affected the frontiers of the Hapsburg Dominions, but it would\r\nnecessarily, and without doubt, have given political preponderance to\r\nthe Slav and Latin elements, which were the most numerous and the most\r\nprolific. Now, those elements form an enormous majority, which was and\r\nis resolutely hostile to any alliance with Germany. Thus, progressively,\r\nthe Hapsburg Monarchy in evolution would have become more and more\r\nindependent of Berlin in regard to her foreign policy, and as it\r\ngradually shook itself free from its bondage to Berlin, it would, as a\r\nnecessary consequence, have drawn closer and closer to Russia, France\r\nand England. Thus Germany would have been deprived of the artificial\r\nprop which she has found at Vienna and at Budapest ever since the days\r\nof Sadowa through the Germano-Magyar predominance. Finally, as a result\r\nof peaceful development, William II. would have been confronted by a\r\nstate of things in Austria-Hungary which would have opposed a far more\r\nformidable barrier to his oriental ambitions than that which was created\r\nin 1913 in the Balkans, as a consequence of the treaty of Bukarest.\r\n\r\nIf we bear in mind the powerful and extraordinarily important series of\r\nafter-effects which must have followed on the new situation produced by\r\nthe treaty of Bukarest and its inevitable influence on the 28 million\r\nSlavs and Latins of Austria-Hungary, we can readily understand that\r\nhad the European peace been maintained, the chances of executing\r\nthe Pangerman plan would have been totally and simultaneously ruined\r\nin Turkey, in the Balkans, and in Austria-Hungary; that is to say in\r\nthe three territorial zones which, as will be seen from Chapter III,\r\nconstituted by far the most important part of the regions mapped out for\r\nPangerman operations in the plan of 1911.\r\n\r\nThus we see how the internal evolution of Austria-Hungary had reached\r\na point at which, as the result of the treaty of Bukarest, it was just\r\nabout to escape for ever from the influence of Berlin; this would have\r\nbroken the pivot on which all the Pangerman combinations revolved. It was\r\nthat consideration which decided William II. to make war at once.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nThe Allies will, in accordance with the general principles of justice,\r\nbring Germany to account for her unheard of crimes, and will exact a\r\nfull reparation for the enormous moral and material injuries which she\r\nhas done them. Therefore it is necessary to set forth the causes of the\r\nwar by a general survey of the facts, to the end that in the eyes of the\r\ncivilized world, it may be clearly demonstrated that Germany must pay,\r\nand legitimately so, the price of a responsibility which, in all justice,\r\nshould rest on her and on her alone.\r\n\r\nTo understand the practical necessity of such a survey, if we are to\r\ninfluence the opinion of neutrals, it is needful to bear in mind that\r\nall discussions which, so far, have been held on the causes of war,\r\nhave been merely based on diplomatic documents published by the various\r\nbelligerents, and that these documents merely refer to facts which\r\npreceded the outbreak of war only by a few weeks. But in a discussion\r\nwhich turns on a multitude of texts, belonging to different dates,\r\nall more or less near each other, and therefore liable to be confused,\r\nnothing is easier than for subtle, interested and dishonest reasoners\r\nlike the Germans, to interpret the same facts in different ways, and so\r\nto arrive at conclusions diametrically opposed to the truth. In fact,\r\nthis is exactly what has happened.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThanks to its intense intellectual mobilization, which has been foreseen\r\nand carried out as powerfully as its military mobilization, Germany has\r\nsucceeded, by fallacious interpretations of diplomatic documents, in\r\nprofoundly misleading neutrals, even honest neutrals, as to the real\r\nresponsibility for the outbreak of war. Nothing could give a better idea\r\nof the effect thus produced by Germany than the following remarks of the\r\n_Swiss_ Colonel Gortsch published in the _Intelligenzblatt_ of Berne:\r\n\r\n“The events which happened at the end of July have convinced every\r\nreasonable man that Germany has been provoked to war, and that the\r\nEmperor William II. has waited long before he took up this challenge.\r\nHistory will lay the main guilt of the war and its intellectual\r\nresponsibility on England; Russia and France will be considered as her\r\naccomplices.... It is the British policy, openly and selfishly free from\r\nany scruples, which has caused the World-War” (quoted by the _Echo de\r\nParis_, 3rd January, 1916).\r\n\r\nThis is exactly the proposition which Bethmann-Hollweg wishes neutrals\r\nto believe. It is an absurd proposition to be entertained by any one\r\nwho knew England intimately in the years before the war. During that\r\nperiod the leaders of the British Government were led by the one guiding\r\nthought—pleasant enough in itself, but entirely inaccurate—that war would\r\nnot occur, since Great Britain did not wish war. The whole foreign\r\npolicy of Great Britain has been inspired by this conception. It explains\r\nthe attitude of extreme conciliation taken by the London Cabinet towards\r\nGermany at the time of the annexation of Bosnia and of Herzegovina\r\n(1909), during the Balkan wars (1912-1913), and also when it came to the\r\nquestion of the Bagdad railway, which most obviously threatened the road\r\nto India. The Liberal Cabinet of London reflected the dominant British\r\nopinion, which believed implicitly in Lord Haldane’s assurances. He was\r\nconsidered, though quite wrongly so, to have a most perfect knowledge\r\nof Germany, and in a speech at Tranent he affirmed to his countrymen:\r\n“Germany has not the slightest intention of invading us” (quoted by the\r\n_Morning Post_, 16th December, 1915). Up to the declaration of war, Sir\r\nEdward Grey, always inclined to believe in the acumen of his friend\r\nLord Haldane, had resorted to every conceivable combination which might\r\nhave allowed peace to be maintained if William II. had really wished\r\nto maintain it. Finally, does not the total unpreparedness of England\r\nfor a continental war, which has been evident since the outbreak of\r\nhostilities, furnish the best proof of her sincerely pacific intentions\r\nbefore the war?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOther neutrals, and even some Frenchmen, still think that the struggle is\r\na result of the so-called Delcassé policy. They say: “The Emperor William\r\nfrequently tried to show himself friendly to France. If his advances had\r\nbeen accepted, war would have been avoided.” It is undeniable that at\r\ncertain moments William II. has tried to draw France into his own orbit,\r\nbut it was precisely in order the better to insure the accomplishment\r\nof the Pangerman plan, which has been his main pre-occupation ever\r\nsince his accession. The present military events show clearly that if\r\nFrance had been beguiled by the smile of the Berlin tempter, any further\r\nefficient coalition of the great powers against Germany would have been\r\na sheer impossibility. As to France, if she had believed in William II.\r\nshe would not have suffered from war, for war would have been useless for\r\nGerman ends. Indeed, without a struggle, France would have practically\r\nbeen reduced to such a state of absolute slavery as has never yet been\r\nachieved in history except as the result of a totally ruinous war.\r\nFacts which have come to light enable us to convince ourselves by the\r\nmost indisputable evidence, that such would have been the outcome of a\r\n“reconciliation” between France and Germany. We now know to what extent\r\nthe Germans had already gained a footing in the greater part of the\r\norganic structure of French finance and industry. If the Paris Government\r\nhad come to terms with Berlin nothing could have stopped the total\r\npacific permeation of France by Germany. Little by little France would\r\nhave ceased to be her own mistress; at the end of a few years she would\r\nhave been exactly in the same position as Austria-Hungary, unable to free\r\nherself unaided from the Prussian hug.\r\n\r\nFinally, can we believe for a moment that, had France carried out such a\r\npolicy of “conciliation” with Berlin, it would have induced William II.\r\nto relinquish his dreams of domination? On the contrary, his easy capture\r\nof France in full enjoyment of peace, would merely have whetted the\r\nhereditary appetites of the Hohenzollerns. Had France once been disposed\r\nof by reason of her pacific permeation by Germany, the bulwark which she\r\nnow forms against the Prussian domination would have been broken. The\r\nexecution of the rest of the Pangerman plan, at the expense of Russia\r\nand England, could then have been effected without encountering any\r\ninsuperable obstacle.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore not the policy called after M. Delcassé which has caused\r\nthe war. M. Delcassé will have quite enough to answer for in regard\r\nto the application of his policy before and during war, without being\r\nreproached for a general principle which evidently was theoretically\r\nsound.\r\n\r\nIn upholding the alliance with Russia, in bringing about the slackening\r\nof tension with Italy, in achieving the Entente Cordiale, M. Delcassé has\r\nfollowed a policy, the principles of which are just. Actual events prove\r\nit convincingly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaving laid bare the fallacy of the German argument, let us now, for the\r\nbenefit of honest neutrals, attempt to give a general view of the true\r\ncauses of the war, and to indicate their sequence. Let us distinguish\r\nbetween the deep-seated and the immediate causes of the struggle.\r\n\r\nThe war can be traced to a single deep and remote cause, namely, the will\r\nof William II. to achieve the Pangerman plan; all secondary causes, that\r\nis to say, the economic ones, spring from it. One aim of the Pangerman\r\nplan was actually to put an end to the enormous difficulties which\r\nGermany had created for herself by the hypertrophy of her industries, and\r\nby thus upsetting the proper balance which had formerly existed between\r\nher agricultural and her industrial productions.\r\n\r\nThe truth of this deep-seated and unique cause of the war is demonstrated\r\nby:\r\n\r\n1º. The intellectual preparation, in all domains, of the Pangerman plan\r\nfor twenty-five years.\r\n\r\n2º. Such explicit and ancient avowals as the following. In 1898\r\nRear-Admiral von Goetzen, an intimate friend of the Kaiser, being at\r\nManilla, said to the American, Admiral Dewey, who had just destroyed\r\nthe Spanish fleet before Manilla: “You will not believe me, but in about\r\nfifteen years my country will begin war. At the end of two months we\r\nshall hold Paris; but that will only form one step towards our real\r\ngoal—the overthrow of England. Every event will happen exactly at its\r\nproper time, for we shall be ready and our enemies will not” (quoted by\r\nthe _Echo de Paris_, 24th September, 1915, from the _Naval and Military\r\nRecord_).\r\n\r\n3º. The material facts of world-wide preparation, obviously for war,\r\nmade several months previous to its outbreak, but not till the Kaiser\r\nhad decided to start it, that is, towards November, 1913. (Proofs:\r\ndeclaration of William II. on 6th November, 1913, to King Albert of\r\nBelgium; interview of the Kaiser with the Arch-Duke Ferdinand, April,\r\n1914, at Miramar, and in June, 1914, at Konopischt, where Admiral Tirpitz\r\naccompanied the Kaiser.)\r\n\r\nThese material facts are endless, but it will suffice to recall the\r\nfollowing as truly significant, because they have required a long and\r\ncomplicated effort: first, the organization for the victualling of the\r\npiratical German cruisers on all the seas of the globe, in view of a long\r\nwar of piracy; and second, the preparation of the revolt against England\r\nin South Africa.\r\n\r\nThe immediate causes which decided William II. to precipitate the war are:\r\n\r\n    1º. The defeat of Turkey in 1912 by Italy and the Balkan\r\n    peoples—a defeat which, by threatening Berlin influence in\r\n    Constantinople, endangered the hold which Germany already had\r\n    on the Ottoman Empire.\r\n\r\n    2º. The consequences of the Bukarest treaty, which in 1913\r\n    had erected automatically a formidable barrier against the\r\n    Pangerman pretensions in the Balkans.\r\n\r\n    3º. The internal evolution of Austria-Hungary, which, because\r\n    of the steady progress made by the Latin and Slav subjects\r\n    of Francis Joseph, threatened shortly to free the Hapsburg\r\n    Monarchy from the tutelage of Berlin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE THREE BARRIERS OF ANTIGERMANIC PEOPLES IN THE BALKANS\r\nAND IN AUSTRIA-HUNGARY.]\r\n\r\nThe facts of the last two groups would have completed in Central Europe\r\nand in the Balkans the three anti-German barriers indicated on the map\r\n(see p. 43) by deep black lines. Now, these barriers would have hindered\r\nonce and for ever the achievement of the Pangerman plan.\r\n\r\nTo parry these blows only one resource remained to William II., and that\r\nwas war—“the national industry of Prussia,” as Mirabeau used to say, and\r\nhis very pithy and apt remark has been too long forgotten.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nHOW FAR THE PANGERMAN PLAN WAS CARRIED OUT AT THE BEGINNING OF 1916.\r\n\r\n    I. German pretensions in the West.\r\n\r\n    II. German pretensions in the East.\r\n\r\n    III. German pretensions in the South and South-East.\r\n\r\n    IV. General view of the execution of the Pangerman plan from\r\n    1911 to the beginning of 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this chapter we shall inquire what relation existed between the actual\r\ngains and the pretensions of the Pangermans at the beginning of 1916,\r\nand those which were foreseen in the 1911 plan. In order to be quite\r\nexplicit we shall analyse successively those gains and pretensions in the\r\nwest, east, south, and south-west. This analysis will enable us finally\r\nto present a general view of the execution of the Pangerman plan at the\r\nperiod under consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nThe map (p. 46) sums up Prussianized Germany’s pretensions which she\r\nstill expected to carry out west of the Rhine at the beginning of 1916.\r\n\r\nThe best way to prove this intention is by means of extracts from the\r\nmemorial sent by the most powerful German associations on May 20th, 1915,\r\nto the Imperial Chancellor (quoted by _Le Temps_, 12th August, 1915). I\r\nhave mentioned (see page 18) why this document must be looked upon as of\r\nextremely exceptional importance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GERMAN CLAIMS IN THE WEST (BEGINNING OF 1916).]\r\n\r\nAs to what concerns Belgium the memorial says:\r\n\r\n“Because it is needful to insure our credit on sea and our military and\r\neconomic situation for the future in face of England, because the Belgian\r\nterritory, which is of the greatest economic importance, is closely\r\nlinked to our principal industrial territory, Belgium must be subjected\r\nto the legislation of the Empire in monetary, financial and postal\r\nmatters. Her railways and her water courses must be closely connected\r\nwith our communications. By constituting a Walloon territory and a\r\nFlemish territory with a preponderance of the Flemish, and by putting\r\ninto German hands the properties and the economic undertakings which are\r\nof vital importance for dominating the country, we shall organize the\r\ngovernment and the administration in such a manner that the inhabitants\r\nwill not be able to acquire any influence over the political destiny of\r\nthe German Empire.”\r\n\r\nIn a word, it is slavery that is promised to the Belgians. In order to\r\nprove clearly that this means exactly the achievement of the plan Berlin\r\nhad elaborated for twenty-five years, it is important to notice that\r\nthe fate of the annexed populations, meted out in the above memorial,\r\nis exactly the same fate mentioned in the pamphlet published under the\r\nauspices of the _Alldeutscher Verband_, the Pangerman Union, wherein the\r\nPangerman plan of 1895 is set forth (_see the text already quoted, p. 4_).\r\n\r\nThe only difference to be noticed in the evolution of the Pangerman ideas\r\nbetween 1895 and 1916 is that after their experience with the Slavs and\r\nLatins of Austria-Hungary, the Germans deem it possible and advantageous,\r\nby an application of Prussian methods of terrorism, to compel non-Germans\r\nto fight for the benefit of Pangermany; true, these people shudder with\r\nhorror at the notion, but stiffened by a strong infusion of Germans, they\r\nare forced to march to the shambles in order to secure slavery and bread\r\nfor their families under the German yoke.\r\n\r\n“As to France,” continues the memorial of the 20th May, 1915, to the\r\nImperial Chancellor, “always in consideration of our position towards\r\nEngland, it is of vital interest for us, in respect of our future on the\r\nseas, that we should own the coast which borders on Belgium more or less\r\nup to the Somme, which would give us an outlet on the Atlantic Ocean.\r\nThe _Hinterland_, which it is necessary to annex at the same time, must\r\nbe of such an extent that economically and strategically the ports,\r\nwhere the canals terminate, can be utilized to the utmost. Any other\r\nterritorial conquest in France, beyond the necessary annexation of the\r\nmining basins of Briey, should only be made in virtue of considerations\r\nof military strategy. In this connection, after the experience of this\r\nwar, it is only natural that we should not expose our frontiers to fresh\r\nenemy invasions by leaving to the adversary fortresses which threaten\r\nus, especially Verdun and Belfort and the Western buttresses of the\r\nVosges, which are situated between those two fortresses. By the conquest\r\nof the line of the Meuse and of the French coast, with the mouths of the\r\ncanals, we should acquire, besides the iron districts of Briey already\r\nmentioned, the coal districts of the departments of the _Nord_ and of the\r\n_Pas de Calais_. This expansion of territory, quite an obvious matter\r\nafter the experience obtained in Alsace-Lorraine, presupposes that the\r\npopulations of the annexed districts shall not be able to obtain a\r\npolitical influence on the destiny of the German Empire, and that all\r\nmeans of economic power which exist on these territories, including\r\nlanded property, both large and middling, will pass into German hands;\r\nFrance will receive and compensate the landowners.”\r\n\r\nIn order to justify these formidable annexations the memorial of the\r\n20th May, in harmony with the frank cynicism of the Pangerman doctrine,\r\nadduces no argument but the convenience of Prussia and the profitableness\r\nof the booty to be got.\r\n\r\n“If the fortress of Longwy, with the numerous blast furnaces of the\r\nregion, were returned to the French, and if a new war broke out, with\r\na few long range guns the German furnaces of Luxemburg (list of which\r\nis given) would be paralyzed in a few hours.... Thus about 20% of the\r\nproduction of crude iron and of German steel would be lost....\r\n\r\n“Let us say, bye the bye, that the high production of steel derived from\r\nthe iron-ore gives to German agriculture the only chance of obtaining\r\nthe phosphoric acid needed when the importation of phosphates is\r\nblockaded.\r\n\r\n“The security of the German Empire, in a future war, requires therefore\r\nimperatively the ownership of all mines of iron-ore including the\r\nfortresses of Longwy and of Verdun, which are necessary to defend the\r\nregion.”\r\n\r\nThese various declarations, made on high authority enable us to affirm,\r\nthat on the whole the annexations which the Pangermans intended to make\r\nin the West would have extended in France more or less to a line drawn\r\nfrom the South of Belfort to the mouth of the Somme, that is, so far\r\nas concerns France, they would comprise a total area of 50,271 square\r\nkilometres, which, before the war, held 5,768,000 inhabitants.\r\n\r\nFurther, as regards France, the intended annexations were, according to\r\nPangerman conceptions, to have had a double effect.\r\n\r\n1º. By taking over the richest industrial and mining French regions,\r\nGermany would secure an enormous booty.\r\n\r\n2º. Deprived of her most productive departments, which bear the main\r\nburden of taxes, and which hold mining elements indispensable to economic\r\nlife, France would have been maimed and reduced to a state from which it\r\nwould have been a sheer impossibility for her to recover or ever again to\r\nbecome a power capable of thwarting in any shape whatsoever the future\r\ndeterminations of Germany.\r\n\r\nA few figures will enable us to verify this forecast. At the beginning\r\nof 1916 the Germans were holding 138,000 hectares of the coal basin of\r\nthe department of the _Nord_, being 41% of the total superficies worked\r\nin France (337,000 hectares), or about three-fourths of the total French\r\nproduction. The Germans also occupied 63,000 hectares of the iron-ore\r\nbasin of Lorraine which represents 75% of the superficies of all the iron\r\nbeds worked in France (83,000 hectares), and nine-tenths of the total\r\nproduction. It is clear, that were such a state of things to continue,\r\neconomic and therefore national life would be made radically impossible\r\nin France, shorn of her vital organs. In reality France would be in a\r\nposition of entire dependence on Germany in accordance with the Pangerman\r\nschemes for the future.\r\n\r\nIt is still necessary to mention that in the territories occupied by\r\nGermany in the West, as well as everywhere else, the measures already\r\ntaken by the Germans in 1916 were not merely measures of military\r\ndefence, but measures for the organization and permanent possession of\r\nthe said territories. These measures to ensure permanent possession may\r\nbe classed in the following categories:\r\n\r\n_Measures of terrorism_ applied in Prussian fashion so as to bring into\r\nsubjection all refractory elements.\r\n\r\n_Measures of division_, such as in Belgium, the Germans take in order\r\nto rouse, by all possible means, opposition between the Flemish and the\r\nWalloons for the purpose of neutralizing the one by the other.\r\n\r\n_Measures of strict and regular administration_ in order, by the bait\r\nof some external or economic advantages, to accustom to the German yoke\r\nthose elements of the population whose moral resistance, in the opinion\r\nof Berlin, can be most easily broken.\r\n\r\n_Measures tending to prepare the German colonization of the new\r\nterritories._ These have mostly consisted in applying the Pangerman\r\ntheory of _Evacuation_, that is, by systematically transporting the\r\nunfortunate women or old people whom Germany considers absolutely useless\r\nin her future possessions. She found it, for instance, very convenient\r\nto rid herself without delay of these poor creatures especially when\r\nthe question of feeding them cropped up; so these “useless mouths” were\r\npromptly transferred to the shoulders of the enemy, whom Germany already\r\nlooked upon as vanquished. That is the theory of _Evacuation_, which\r\nexplains to a large extent why the German authorities have sent back to\r\nFrance that part of the populations of the occupied territories in France\r\nand Belgium whom, on exact inquiry, they regarded as human wastage.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNo doubt, as is shown on map (p. 46), Germany did not at the beginning\r\nof 1916 occupy quite all the territories she coveted. She missed Calais,\r\nBelfort, and Verdun, but it is easy to see that she did so only by a\r\nhair’s breadth.\r\n\r\nThe Western territories which were to enter into the Germanic\r\nConfederation of the 1911 plan include:\r\n\r\n                        Square Kilometres.\r\n\r\n    Holland                   38,141\r\n    Belgium                   29,451\r\n    Luxemburg                  2,586\r\n    French Departments        50,271\r\n                             -------\r\n            Total            120,449\r\n\r\nNow Luxemburg and Belgium were entirely occupied (excepting a patch of\r\nBelgium). If Germany was to hold Belgium, Holland, which is not occupied,\r\nbut which is geographically invested, would inevitably be forced to enter\r\ninto the Germanic Confederation. We must, therefore, consider Holland\r\nas being virtually under Germany’s thumb. As, on the other hand, out of\r\n50,271 square kilometres which she wished to annex at the expense of\r\nFrance, Germany, at the beginning of 1916, occupied 20,300, we conclude\r\nthat the German enterprises in the West, which, according to programme,\r\nought to have comprised 120,449 square kilometres, in point of fact\r\nextended directly or indirectly over 90,478 square kilometres.\r\n\r\nGermany therefore, early in 1916, had achieved in the West an occupation\r\nforeseen by the plan of 1911 and at the expense of non-Germans in the\r\nproportion of 76% or three-fourths.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nThe Pangerman plan of 1911 had provided for the permanent exclusion of\r\nRussia as a great power by means of two measures:\r\n\r\n1º. To carve out of the Empire of the Tsars and annex to the German\r\nConfederation a slice of territory large enough to cut off Russia\r\nentirely from the West.\r\n\r\n2º. To constitute at the expense of Russia, thus reduced, new States\r\nwhich should bow the knee to Berlin.\r\n\r\nMr. Dietrich Schaefer, the well-known historian, in the Review _Panther_,\r\naffirmed, early in February, 1915: “It is absolutely necessary for us\r\nto expand the sphere of our power, especially eastward ... the immense\r\nRussian force must recede behind the Dnieper” (quoted by _L’Information_,\r\n5th February, 1915).\r\n\r\nA Swedish pamphlet, ascribed to the Germanophile, Adrian Molin,\r\nexplained, also early in 1915, that Germany, with the help of Sweden,\r\nwas to have given the finishing stroke in separating Russia from Europe\r\nby means of a barrier formed of Buffer-States, to wit, Finland and\r\nthe Ukraine. Now, for the last twenty-five years in particular, the\r\nPangerman agents have endeavoured to sow the seeds of rebellion among\r\nthe 20 millions of Small-Russians who live in the Russian Governments\r\ngrouped around Kieff. Finally, the Moslem regions of Russia (Caucasus,\r\nCentral Asia, etc.) were to form special States under the sway of\r\nTurkish suzerainty, and, through that channel, to bear the yoke of German\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GERMAN CLAIMS IN THE EAST.]\r\n\r\nSuch were the means elaborated at Berlin to bring about the annihilation\r\nof Russia as a great power, when once her armies had been destroyed;\r\nand this might have happened perhaps, if the English intervention, by\r\nenabling France to make a stand, had not prevented Germany from first\r\nsmashing France and then concentrating all her forces against the Empire\r\nof the Tsar, in accordance with the plan of the General Staff of Berlin.\r\n\r\nWe can form an estimate of the annexations which Germany, as late as\r\nthe beginning of 1916, still hoped to effect at the cost of Russia by\r\nexamining the memorial of May 20th, 1915, addressed to the Imperial\r\nChancellor; although the phraseology in which it is drawn up aims at\r\nconcealing the full extent of the Pangerman demands, it yet tallies, in\r\nits tendencies, with the programme published by Tannenberg in 1911:\r\n\r\n“With regard to the East,” says that memorial, “the following\r\nconsideration must guide us: For the great increase of industrial\r\npower which we expect in the West we must secure a counterpoise by the\r\nannexation of an agricultural territory of equal value in the East.\r\nIt is necessary to strengthen the agricultural basis of our national\r\neconomy; to secure room for the expansion of a great German agricultural\r\nsettlement; to restore to our Empire the German peasants living in a\r\nforeign land, particularly in Russia, who are now actually without the\r\nprotection of the law; finally, we must increase considerably the number\r\nof our fellow countrymen able to bear arms; all these matters require an\r\nimportant extension of the frontiers of the Empire and of Prussia towards\r\nthe East through the annexation of at least some parts of the Baltic\r\nprovinces and of territories to the South of them, while keeping in view\r\nthe necessity of a military defence of the Eastern German frontier.\r\n\r\n“As to what political rights to give to the inhabitants of the new\r\nterritories and as to what guarantees are necessary to further German\r\ninfluence and economics, we will merely refer to what we have said about\r\nFrance. The war indemnity to be exacted from Russia should to a large\r\nextent consist in the surrender of territory” (see _Le Temps_, 12th\r\nAugust, 1915).\r\n\r\nIn his speech of 11th December, 1915, William II.’s Chancellor, in a\r\nsentence full of significance, gave his hearers to understand that such\r\nwere indeed the pretensions of Germany:\r\n\r\n“Our troops,” said he, “in conjunction with the Austro-Hungarian, are\r\ntaking up strongly fortified positions of defence far within the Russian\r\nterritory. They are ready to resume their forward march.”\r\n\r\nJust as in the West, all the measures taken by the Germans in the East\r\nhave been not only for defence, but for organization in view of keeping\r\nthe occupied territories. These measures come under the various heads I\r\nindicated. (_See_ p. 50.)\r\n\r\nWith the Poles, the Germans used the same tactics as with the Flemish\r\npeople of Belgium. After having terrorized the Poles, the Prussian\r\nauthorities granted them, in the use of their own language for scholastic\r\npurposes, certain privileges which compare advantageously with the former\r\nstate of things resulting from that detestable bureaucratic régime of\r\nRussia, which, with a complete lack of foresight, had by its vexatious\r\nmeasures seriously imperilled in Poland the true interests of the empire\r\nof the Tsars. Again, in the East the Germans promoted husbandry. They\r\nconstructed railroads and coach roads. No doubt all these steps were\r\ntaken mainly in the interest of Germany. It is quite clear that the\r\nadvantages conceded to the Poles can only be considered as temporary.\r\nThis is proved sufficiently by the Prussian system so long pursued in\r\nPosen. However, the Germans flatter themselves that by these measures\r\nthey favourably impress some portion of the Poles, who are simple\r\nenough to imagine that Germany will reconstitute a Polish State of 20\r\nmillions of inhabitants in order to give this State to the Poles at the\r\nexpense of Russia. It was with such an end in view that Berlin thought\r\nof proclaiming the autonomy of Poland. At the same time Germany reckons\r\non establishing in Poland a system of conscription so as to utilize, by\r\nforce if necessary, the Polish recruits, just as she has done with the\r\nSlavs of Austria-Hungary, in the interest of Pangermany.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom the territorial standpoint the Pangerman pretensions of the 1911\r\nplan in the East are summarized in the following table:\r\n\r\n                                        Square\r\n                                      Kilometres.

They therefore\r\nhad carried out in the East the plan of 1911 at the cost of non-German\r\npopulations to the extent of 75% or three-fourths.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nThe zones of absolute influence, whether direct or indirect, which\r\nGermany, in accordance with the 1911 plan, has tried to secure for\r\nherself in the South and South-East of her present frontiers, comprise\r\nthree totally distinct groups of territory: Austria-Hungary, the Balkans,\r\nand Turkey. It is therefore advisable to examine separately how at the\r\nbeginning of 1916 Germany stood in respect of each of these three groups.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GERMAN CLAIMS IN THE SOUTH AND SOUTH-EAST.]\r\n\r\n1º. Austria-Hungary.\r\n\r\nLet us make no mistake, Austria-Hungary is actually as much under\r\nWilliam II.’s domination as is Belgium. The European conflict has\r\nenabled Germany artfully to occupy the Empire of the Hapsburgs under\r\nthe pretence of defending it, in fact to seize it as provided for by\r\nthe plan of 1911. Since the beginning of 1915 all the troops of Francis\r\nJoseph have been entirely under the orders of the Berlin General Staff.\r\nEven if Austria-Hungary wished to make a separate peace, she could not\r\ndo so, for all her motive power, diplomatic and military, is exclusively\r\ncontrolled by the Kaiser’s agents. The Austro-German alliance is merely\r\na piece of stage scenery. The much-talked of device of smuggling the\r\nHapsburg Empire into Germany by a back door, that is, by her entrance\r\ninto the _Zollverein_ or Customs Union, is a broad farce. It can merely\r\ndeceive those, alas still too numerous, who are insufficiently informed\r\nof the true facts in Austria-Hungary. The Austro-German fusion in the\r\nshape of a Customs Union is besides no novelty. The process of absorbing\r\nAustria-Hungary was foreseen and described in detail in the Pangerman\r\npamphlet of 1895, showing the fundamental lines of the plan of that date.\r\nAll the fuss made at the beginning of 1916 by the German Press about the\r\nso-called wishes of the Austro-Hungarians to enter into the _Zollverein_\r\nhas been the most “Kolossal” and the most dishonest of bluffs. In truth,\r\nnearly three-fourths of the populations at present subject to Francis\r\nJoseph do not want to be absorbed into Germany at any price, neither\r\nin a political, nor in an economic fashion. All the stir made in the\r\nCentral Empires about the entrance of the Hapsburg Monarchy into the\r\n_Zollverein_, has been the doing of Pangerman bear leaders at Berlin\r\nor Vienna and of the Magyar aristocracy, and not at all of the Magyar\r\npeople, which is not the same thing. Let us therefore not be duped by the\r\nbluff of the German press on the _Zollverein_ question. The microscopic\r\nminority who wish it in Austria-Hungary plays the Berlin game. What is\r\nundeniable is that at present Austria-Hungary is entirely under the\r\nPrussian thumb.\r\n\r\n2º. The Balkans.\r\n\r\nThe whole of Serbia has been overrun by the Germans. The predicament\r\nof the Serbian population is extremely cruel. Either they have been\r\nmassacred, or systematically famished or deported to Germany to work\r\nin the factories or on the German land. These appalling measures of\r\ncoercion have not prevented the Kaiser from addressing a manifesto: “To\r\n_my_ noble and heroic Serbian People.” The aim was, by fine words, to\r\ndisarm morally the remainder of the Serbian population, terrorized by a\r\nseries of sufferings unsurpassed in history. As to Serbia, the Kaiser\r\noffered part of it to Austria, always in accordance with the plan of 1895\r\nwhich provided for this solution; for to give a fraction of Serbia to\r\nAustria as a member of the _Zollverein_, is practically to put it under\r\nthe direct domination of Germany.\r\n\r\nAs to Bulgaria, the ally of Germany, she is entirely absorbed, and the\r\nGermans there behave as rulers so far as they possibly can. Heroic\r\nMontenegro has suffered exactly the same fate as Serbia, one part of\r\nAlbania is also occupied. If the Allies had been fatuous enough not to\r\nunderstand, at the eleventh hour, the importance of Salonika, Greece\r\nand Roumania, where Germanophile elements are not numerous but very\r\ninfluential, would already have obeyed to the letter the orders of Berlin.\r\n\r\nSupposing, for argument’s sake, that there were a German victory, we\r\nwould immediately see Germany constituting a Balkan Confederation under\r\nthe headship of Austria, considered as a Balkan power, simply because,\r\nunder the name of Austria, it would really be Germany who would impose\r\nher will on the future confederation.\r\n\r\n3º. Turkey.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of 1916, before the Russian advance in Armenia, the\r\nOttoman Empire throughout its entire length was subjected to the\r\ninfluence of Germany; that influence had even spread to Persia. We\r\nhave here an event which would have had an extreme importance for the\r\ndevelopment of the Panislamic movement directed simultaneously against\r\nRussia, France and England, if the Anglo-Russian attitude had not\r\nrecently put a stopper on German intrigues in the Shah’s Empire.\r\n\r\n“The establishment of direct relations with Turkey is of inestimable\r\nmilitary value,” said the German Chancellor in his speech of December\r\n11th, 1915, “while on the economic side the possibility of importing\r\ngoods from the Balkan States and from Turkey will increase our supplies\r\nin a most satisfactory way” (see _Le Temps_, 11th December, 1915). It\r\nwould be a mistake to see in these words the result of a mere bluff, of\r\nwhich the Germans are so often lavish. If the Allies left Germany time to\r\ndraw from Turkey all the military and economic resources expected from\r\nher at Berlin, future events would evidently prove that the Imperial\r\nChancellor’s words deserve to be taken seriously.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo sum up, the Pangerman plan of 1911 provided in the South and\r\nSouth-East for:\r\n\r\n    +------------------------------------+-------------+--------------+\r\n    |                                    |   Square    |              |\r\n    |                                    | Kilometres. | Inhabitants. |\r\n    +------------------------------------+-------------+--------------+\r\n    | The absorption of Austria-Hungary  |    676,616  |  50,000,000  |\r\n    |                                    |             |              |\r\n    | The establishment of immediate     |             |              |\r\n    |   and absolute German influence on |             |              |\r\n    |   the Balkan States                |    490,275  |  22,000,000  |\r\n    |                                    |             |              |\r\n    | The establishment of exclusive     |             |              |\r\n    |   German influence on Turkey       |  1,792,900  |  20,000,000  |\r\n    +------------------------------------+-------------+--------------+\r\n    |    Total                           |  2,959,791  |  92,000,000  |\r\n    +------------------------------------+-------------+--------------+\r\n\r\nNow, at the beginning of 1916, the plan of 1911 was carried out in the\r\nfollowing proportions:\r\n\r\nAustria-Hungary had her 676,616 square kilometres occupied (minus the\r\nsmall area in the hands of the Italians), being more or less 100%.\r\n\r\nIn the Balkans, at the same date, under direct German influence, we have:\r\n\r\n                     Square Kilometres.\r\n    Bulgaria                114,105\r\n    Serbia                   87,300\r\n    Montenegro               14,180\r\n                            -------\r\n        Total               215,585\r\n\r\nequalling 43% of the total of the Balkan States’ territory.\r\n\r\nIn Turkey the German influence was exerted over almost the entire\r\nterritory, therefore in the proportion of 100%.\r\n\r\nIf we now add the figures belonging to the three territorial groups aimed\r\nat by the 1911 plan in the South and South-East we shall see that Germany\r\nhas carried out her programme on\r\n\r\n                     Square Kilometres.\r\n    Austria-Hungary         676,616\r\n    Balkans                 215,585\r\n    Turkey                1,792,900\r\n                          ---------\r\n        Total             2,685,101\r\n\r\nAs the total plan aimed at the German direct or indirect seizure of\r\n2,968,791 square kilometres, we see that, considered in that light, the\r\ngoal of the 1911 plan has been reached in the South and South-East in the\r\nproportion of 89%, being roughly nine-tenths.\r\n\r\nNow I have shown (_pp. 52 and 56_) that Germany occupied or controlled\r\nearly in 1916:\r\n\r\n    In the West over 90,478 square kilometres.\r\n\r\n    In the East over 260,000 square kilometres.\r\n\r\nWe have just seen that in the South and South-East the German plan has\r\nbeen achieved over 2,685,101 square kilometres.\r\n\r\nOf course all the territories included in that last figure are far from\r\nhaving the same value, especially those of part of Turkey, but in that\r\nfigure Austria-Hungary alone claims 676,616 square kilometres, that is,\r\nshe alone represents a seizure, disguised it may be, yet not less real,\r\nwhich is infinitely more considerable than the German occupations in the\r\nWest and East.\r\n\r\nFrom these calculations it clearly follows that the part of the Pangerman\r\nplan which concerns Austria-Hungary, the Balkans and Turkey, that is,\r\nCentral Europe and the East, forms by far the main part of the Pangerman\r\nscheme. That is an observation of extreme importance for the Allies and\r\nfor Neutrals, because of the world-wide consequences which flow from the\r\nscheme summed up in the formula, “From Hamburg to the Persian Gulf.”\r\nThese consequences will be stated in Chapter V.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nThe Pangerman plan of 1911 (_see map, p. 12_) included:\r\n\r\n1º. The formation of a great German Confederation which was to put under\r\nthe absolute supremacy of the present German Empire (540,858 square\r\nkilometres and 68 million inhabitants) foreign territories situated\r\naround Germany, which form a superficies of 1,182,113 square kilometres\r\nand hold 94 million inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe figures given (_pp. 52, 56 and 61_) suffice to prove that the German\r\nseizure of these territories extended at the beginning of 1916:\r\n\r\n                                       Square Kilometres.\r\n    To the West                                90,478\r\n    To the East                               260,000\r\n    To the South (Austria-Hungary)            676,616\r\n                                            ---------\r\n        Total                               1,027,094\r\n\r\nGermany has therefore, so far as concerns the territories to be absorbed\r\ninto the Germanic Confederation, achieved her programme in the proportion\r\nof 86%, or about nine-tenths.\r\n\r\n2º. The absolute subordination to Germany of all the Balkan States, whose\r\nsuperficies is 499,275 square kilometres, holding 22 million inhabitants.\r\nWe have seen above (_p. 61_), that the German seizure actually extends\r\nover 215,585 square kilometres. The German programme, therefore, as\r\nregards the Balkans, has been achieved in the proportion of 43%.\r\n\r\n3º. The more or less veiled seizure by Germany of the Ottoman Empire,\r\nbeing 1,792,900 square kilometres, holding 20 million inhabitants. Now,\r\nearly in 1916 the exclusive German influence was felt over the whole of\r\nTurkey. As regards her the German plan had therefore been achieved in the\r\nproportion of 100%.\r\n\r\nLet us now group the figures which will enable us to show in what\r\nproportion the whole Pangerman plan of 1911 has been actually achieved by\r\nGermany:\r\n\r\n    +-------------------------------------+-------------+-------------+\r\n    |                                     | Provisions  |   Actual    |\r\n    |                                     | of the 1911 |achievements.|\r\n    |                                     |plan.

She wished it simply because, as the _Frankfurter\r\nZeitung_ owned, without mincing matters, in December, 1915, the goal of\r\nthe war had been reached.\r\n\r\nNine-tenths of the whole of the Pangerman plan of 1911 having been\r\npractically achieved, in spite of England’s intervention, which,\r\nhowever, had upset the German Staff’s plan, it is absolutely clear that\r\nthe results obtained by Germany have been considerable in the extreme.\r\nNothing could therefore be more to her advantage now than to succeed\r\nin putting an end to the war at a time when German influence extends\r\nunchecked over almost the whole of the invaded territories.\r\n\r\nThese statements again explain why Berlin has for such a long time\r\nbeen occupied with the most subtle and most complex manœuvres for the\r\nopening of peace negotiations—attempts at a separate agreement with\r\nRussia, efforts to obtain the Pope’s intervention, advances made by\r\nthe pseudo-socialists of the Kaiser towards their former comrades\r\nof belligerent countries, incitements to pacificists of all neutral\r\ncountries, etc. Germany would have concluded peace at the moment which\r\nwas most favourable to her, so as to be able to impose on the territories\r\nwhich she has either conquered or controls the special status provided\r\nfor each of them by the Pangerman plan. But of course Germany would only\r\nhave made such treaties as were compatible with her retention of all the\r\nregions she occupied at the time. As Major Moraht said very clearly in\r\nthe _Berliner Tageblatt_: “Our military chiefs are not in the habit of\r\ngiving back what we have acquired at the price of blood and of sacrifice”\r\n(_Le Matin_, 27th December, 1915).\r\n\r\nLastly, the chief reason why Berlin wanted peace is that the prolongation\r\nof the war can only compromise and finally ruin all the results obtained\r\nby Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nSPECIAL FEATURES GIVEN TO THE WAR BY THE PANGERMAN PLAN.\r\n\r\n    I. All the great political questions of the old world are\r\n    raised and must be solved.\r\n\r\n    II. As the war is made by Germany in order to achieve a\r\n    gigantic scheme of slavery, it follows that it is waged by her\r\n    in flagrant violation of international law.\r\n\r\n    III. A struggle of tenacity and of duplicity on the side of\r\n    Berlin _versus_ constancy and solidarity on the side of the\r\n    Allies.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Diplomatic Corps, having ignored the Pangerman plan for reasons\r\nalready shown (_pp. 19_ _et seq._), it is quite natural that the General\r\nStaffs and the public opinion of Allied countries should have been\r\nequally ignorant. From this general absence of knowledge there has\r\nresulted a vagueness and inadequacy in the view taken of the ultimate\r\naims of Germany in the war; and in consequence the co-ordination of the\r\nAllied efforts has remained for a long while very imperfect. Each of the\r\nAllied nations, in fact, was at first so taken up with its own interests\r\nthat they all lost sight of what ought to have been the common object of\r\ntheir common action.\r\n\r\nThe Russians entered into the struggle against the Germans especially to\r\nprevent Serbia from being crushed, and at the same time to put an end to\r\nthose veiled but profoundly humiliating ultimatums which Berlin for some\r\nyears has delivered to Petrograd. The Italians, specially fascinated by\r\nTrent and Trieste, have long thought that they could limit their war to\r\na conflict with the house of Hapsburg, when in reality the only and true\r\nenemy of the Italian people—as now the latter is more and more clearly\r\naware—is Prussian Pangermanism. As for the English, they entered the\r\nlists for two fundamental reasons: the violation of Belgium’s neutrality\r\naroused their indignation, and a just sense of their own interests has\r\nconvinced them that they could not allow France to be crushed without\r\nat the same time acquiescing in the ultimate disappearance of Great\r\nBritain. Completely unprepared for Continental war, England has very\r\nwell understood from the beginning of hostilities that these might be\r\nvery much prolonged, but she had not the slightest notion that British\r\ninterests would be as completely threatened as they have been in Central\r\nEurope, in Turkey, in Egypt, and in India. As to the French, the German\r\naggression immediately raised in their minds and in their hearts the\r\nquestion of Alsace-Lorraine. This has hypnotized them to such a degree,\r\nto their own loss, that they have too long considered the fight merely\r\na Franco-German war, whereas they ought to have viewed the European\r\nconflagration in its full dimensions.\r\n\r\nThis piece-meal way of looking at the facts has been of the greatest\r\ndisservice to all the Allies. Indeed it has had the effect of preventing\r\nthem from discerning at the right time the special character which the\r\nextraordinary extent of the Pangerman plan must necessarily give to the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nThe very vastness of the Pangerman plan of 1911, demonstrated beyond\r\ndispute by the facts that have come to light, suffices to prove that\r\nBerlin meant to solve for her own profit, at one single blow, all the\r\ngreat political questions latent in the old world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GREAT POLITICAL QUESTIONS RAISED BY THE WAR.]\r\n\r\nThe claims of Germany on the East, shown on the accompanying map by the\r\nthinner black line, raised the question of Poland in its immense extent\r\nand in all its complexity. The claims of Germany towards the West, also\r\nshown on the map by the thinner black line, involved the independence of\r\nHolland, of Belgium, of Luxemburg, of France, threatened with the loss of\r\nvital territories. Further, towards the West the German aggression has\r\nbrought forward the question of Alsace-Lorraine from the French point of\r\nview. Moreover, since Germany aims at establishing her absolute supremacy\r\nfrom Hamburg to the Persian Gulf, in order to stretch her political\r\ntentacles to the Far East and to the whole world by means which will be\r\nshown in Chapter V. the present war compels the powers to face the whole\r\nEastern question (Balkans and Turkey, shown on the map by similar black\r\nlines), and also the whole question of Austria. (Used in this sense the\r\nexpression Austria indicates the whole of the Hapsburg Dominion, that\r\nis, the territory enclosed by a thick black line.) In short, the whole\r\nof the great foreign questions are raised at one blow before the world by\r\nthe aggression of the Berlin Government.\r\n\r\nThe Germans, having studied thoroughly for a very long time all these\r\nproblems, have also provided for each of them a solution in accordance\r\nwith their most cynical interests. The result is that all these political\r\nproblems, raised simultaneously, form a tangled skein, and that the\r\nAllies will never be really victorious till they can compel the Germans\r\nto accept those solutions of the great problems which by the nature of\r\nthings must be the direct contrary of those foreshadowed by Berlin. The\r\nEastern question which is now raised in Europe is no longer the old\r\northodox question but a Prussianized Eastern question coloured in all its\r\naspects by the present and future ambitions of the Hohenzollerns. In the\r\nsame way the question of modern Austria is no longer the old Austrian\r\nquestion which consisted in the traditional struggle of the Hapsburgs\r\nwith their various nationalities. What the Allies have now to consider\r\nin Central Europe is the question of Austria Prussianized by means of\r\ntwo essential facts: the covert but exclusive influence which Berlin\r\nhas increasingly exercised over Vienna, especially for the last fifteen\r\nyears, and the hold which the Hohenzollerns have got by means of the\r\nwar over the whole of the Hapsburg Monarchy, which includes 28 millions\r\nof Slav and Latin populations bowed under the yoke, with no hope of\r\ndeliverance except through the crushing of Prussian militarism.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nThe Pangerman plan finally gives to the struggle which it has initiated a\r\ncharacter of sanguinary horror without parallel in history.\r\n\r\nIn short, William II., after having roused by means of Pangerman\r\npropaganda amongst his people violent desires of conquest and plunder,\r\nhas declared war with the fixed idea that it will lead in Europe\r\nand in Turkey to the supremacy of 77 millions of Germans, over 127\r\nmillions of non-Germans. The small but violent Prussophile Camarilla\r\nof Vienna, a group of Magyar aristocrats in league with Count Tisza, a\r\nhandful of pseudo young Turks bought by Berlin, have been the Kaiser’s\r\naccomplices. Finally, it is these few men alone who have drawn into war\r\n50 million Austro-Hungarians and 20 million Ottomans, that is, 70 million\r\nbelligerents, the vast majority of whom certainly did not wish for a\r\nsanguinary conflict. From all this it is clear that these peoples were\r\nbetrayed into the war by their Kings or their Turco-Magyar governments.\r\n\r\nThe origin as well as the object of the war make it therefore the most\r\ncruelly reactionary enterprise conceivable. It is so to such a degree\r\nthat those who in France are called reactionaries and who compared to\r\nthe Prussian _Junkers_ are great Liberals, find themselves in close\r\nagreement with the most ardent Socialists in desiring the total ruin of\r\nan enterprise which, if successful, would put the modern world back into\r\nthe Middle Ages in the most odious fashion. But this time it would be a\r\nmediæval state of things made immutable through the force of the most\r\nmodern science, which would stop the clock of progress. The death-dealing\r\nelectric current which runs in the metallic wires actually forming an\r\nimpassable barrier between Belgium and Holland forms a perfect symbol of\r\nwhat the Pangerman prison would be for those who do not belong to the\r\nGerman nationality.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the very fact that they pursue a plan of gigantic and\r\nunheard of slavery has logically led the Germans, first cynically to\r\nviolate all the laws of war between belligerents, and then systematically\r\nto commit abominable crimes against common law, whether at the expense\r\nof neutrals whom they would terrorize, such as the factory hands of the\r\nUnited States, or at the expense of the unhappy civil populations of the\r\n“burglared” regions, populations whose sufferings are indescribable.\r\nThe events resulting from Pangerman terrorism are so numerous and so\r\nunutterably atrocious that historians will find the greatest difficulty\r\nin painting the Dantesque picture of all these crimes in their colossal\r\nhorror. Undoubtedly the Germans wage war in a manner which assimilates\r\nthem to vulgar burglars and assassins, and therefore to common criminals.\r\nThey have thus placed themselves beyond the pale of humanity, and those\r\nwho outside of Germany knowingly help them in their task of enslaving\r\nEurope are nothing more or less than accomplices and should be dealt with\r\nas such.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nOn January 19th, 1916, in the Reichstag, Deputy Martin stated that “The\r\nGerman nation would be very ill-pleased if Germany were to restore the\r\nterritories she now occupies” (_Le Temps_, 21st January, 1916). This\r\nsentence summarizes the opinion prevalent beyond the Rhine.\r\n\r\nIn their endeavours to retain the greater part of the territories\r\noccupied by them at the beginning of 1916 the Germans have combined\r\nmilitary measures with political manœuvres.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GERMAN FORTRESS AT THE BEGINNING OF 1916.]\r\n\r\nThey have entrenched themselves tremendously on all fronts which\r\nthe Allies could possibly attack. By the accumulation everywhere of\r\ndefensive works, machine-guns and heavy artillery, the Germans hope\r\nto counter-balance the losses of their troops and thus to persevere\r\nin their resistance to the allied attacks, till the enemy grow weary\r\nof the dreadful struggle. The experience of the war having proved how\r\nextremely difficult it is to pierce strongly fortified lines, the German\r\nHeadquarters Staff appears to have taken this knowledge as the base of\r\nthe following calculation:\r\n\r\n“We have achieved nine-tenths of the annexations on which we counted;\r\nonly Calais, Verdun, Belfort, Riga and Salonika are wanting. We will\r\ntry to obtain possession of these places if opportunity offers; if not,\r\nin order to avoid excessive risks, we shall remain everywhere in Europe\r\non a keen defensive, but we will pretend, all the time, to wish to take\r\nthe offensive, so as to mislead our adversaries. If the Franco-English\r\ninsist on concentrating their efforts, above all against our lines of the\r\nWestern front, as these lines are manifold and very strong, the enemy\r\nlosses will be such, that even if they succeed in throwing us back, they\r\nwill finally be so utterly exhausted as to be unable to cross the Rhine.\r\nTherefore, they will be powerless to dictate peace to Germany.”\r\n\r\nSurely the Allies, taught by experience, can foil this probable\r\ncalculation of their antagonists by well managed, simultaneous attacks on\r\nthe whole accessible circuit of the German fortress. In fact this is what\r\nthe Allies seem more and more inclined to do.\r\n\r\nThe indented line on the map (p. 72) shows what a strange shape is\r\nassumed by the enormous territories which build up that fortress. For\r\nalimentary purposes it is victualled, firstly, by the resources of\r\nnon-German countries which are occupied and most thoroughly drained,\r\nand secondly by importations; which come through the channel of neutral\r\ncountries—Holland, Denmark, Sweden, Roumania, and Switzerland—which have\r\nresponded, more or less liberally, whether voluntarily or not, to the\r\npressing applications of Germany.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, thanks to the passage through the Balkans, the German\r\nfortress, early in 1916, had a wide open door on Persia, the Caucasus,\r\nCentral-Russian Asia, Afghanistan, India and Egypt. After having armed\r\nall the Moslems on whom they could lay hands, and who were able to\r\nshoulder a gun, the German Staff reckoned on striking at Great Britain\r\nand Russia in all these directions. The successes obtained by the Tsar’s\r\ntroops in Eastern Turkey have, since then, baffled these projects.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, as Germany has nothing whatever to gain by a\r\nprolongation of the war, she will continue to aim at a rupture of the\r\nCoalition by means of every possible political manœuvre. It is clear that\r\nthe defection of one of the principal Allies would necessarily place\r\nall the others in vastly more difficult positions for continuing the\r\nstruggle. Assuming that such a thing were to happen, the Germans could,\r\nindeed, hope to discuss peace on the base of the territories which they\r\nactually occupy. They will therefore repeat and increase their bids for\r\na separate peace with one or other of their adversaries. When once their\r\nposition becomes very difficult the Germans, so as to shatter at all cost\r\nthe Coalition, will make propositions of separate peace to one of the\r\nAllies, offering that one country almost complete satisfaction in the\r\nhope that, swayed perhaps by a section of their people who have grown\r\nweary of war, that Allied country will lay down her arms.\r\n\r\nThe Allied State which, contrary to its plighted faith, should separately\r\ntreat with Berlin, would soon be punished for its infamy. By allowing\r\nGermany to conclude peace more or less on the basis of the territories\r\nshe at present holds, the traitor State would find itself afterwards\r\nconfronted by a formidable German Empire, and would inevitably become one\r\nof its first victims.\r\n\r\nThe Germans will perhaps try to play on the Allies the “armistice trick.”\r\nHere, again, we should have a cunning calculation founded once more on\r\nthe weariness of the combatants. It is, indeed, conceivable that a simple\r\narmistice might end in allowing Germany to hold finally most of her\r\nactual territorial acquisitions; but it could so end only by means of a\r\nmanœuvre which we must now expose.\r\n\r\nNo doubt they must make at Berlin the following calculation, which\r\ntheoretically has something to be said for it: “If an armistice were\r\nsigned, the Allied soldiers would think: ‘They are talking, therefore it\r\nmeans peace, and demobilization will soon follow.’ Under these conditions\r\nthe effect will be the moral slackening of our adversaries.” The Germans\r\ncould not ask for anything better. They would open peace negotiations\r\nwith the following astute idea. To understand the manœuvre we must\r\nremember the proposals of peace which that active agent, Dr. Alfred\r\nHermann Fried, of Vienna, was charged to throw out as a sounding-lead\r\non the 27th December, 1915, in an article of the _Nouvelle Gazette de\r\nZurich_, which made a great stir. These proposals were mixed up with\r\nprovisoes, which would allow the discussion to be opened or broken off at\r\nany moment desired. For example, Belgium would preserve her independence,\r\nbut “on condition of treaties, perhaps also of guarantees, which would\r\nrender impossible a repetition of the events of 1914.” The occupied\r\ndepartments of France would be restored unconditionally to France, but\r\n“some small rectifications of frontiers might perhaps be desired in the\r\ninterests of both parties” (_Journal de Genève_, 29th December, 1915).\r\nAssuming that the Allies committed the enormous mistake of discussing\r\npeace on such treacherous terms, Germany still entrenched behind her\r\nfronts, which would have been rendered almost impregnable, would say\r\nto the Allies, “I don’t agree with you. After all you cannot require\r\nof me that I should evacuate territories from which you are powerless\r\nto drive me. If you are not satisfied, continue the war.” As, while\r\nthe negotiations were pending, all needful steps would have been taken\r\nby the German agents to aggravate the moral slackening of the soldiers\r\nof such Allied countries as might be most weary of the struggle, the\r\nhuge military machine of the Entente could not again be put in motion\r\nas a whole. The real result would be, in fact, the rupture of the\r\nAnti-Germanic Coalition, and finally the conclusion of a peace more or\r\nless based on actual occupation. Berlin’s goal would thus have been\r\nreached.\r\n\r\nFinally, when the “armistice trick” shall have also failed, and the\r\nsituation of Germany shall have grown still worse, we shall see Berlin\r\nplay her last trump. Petitions against territorial annexations will be\r\nmultiplied on the other side of the Rhine. In an underhand way they will\r\nbe favoured by the Government of Berlin, which will end by saying to\r\nthe Allies: “Let us stop killing each other. I am perfectly reasonable.\r\nI give up my claims on such of your territories as are occupied by my\r\narmies. Let us negotiate peace on the basis of the ‘drawn game.’”\r\n\r\nThe day when this proposal will be made, the Allies will have to face\r\nthe most astute of the Berlin tricks, the most alarming German trap. At\r\nthat moment the tenacity, the clearsightedness, and the solidarity of the\r\nAllies must be put forth to the utmost. To show the extreme necessity of\r\nthis, in the case supposed, I must baffle the German manœuvre in advance\r\nby proving clearly in the following chapter that the dodge of the drawn\r\ngame, if it succeeded, would mask in reality a formidable success for\r\nGermany and an irreparable catastrophe for the Allies and for the freedom\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE DODGE OF THE “DRAWN GAME” AND THE SCHEME “FROM HAMBURG TO THE PERSIAN\r\nGULF.”\r\n\r\n    I. What would really be the outcome of the dodge called the\r\n    “Drawn Game.”\r\n\r\n    II. The financial consequences for the Allies of this so-called\r\n    “Drawn Game.”\r\n\r\n    III. The Allies and the scheme “From Hamburg to the Persian\r\n    Gulf.”\r\n\r\n    IV. Panislamic and Asiatic consequences of the achievement of\r\n    the scheme “From Hamburg to the Persian Gulf.”\r\n\r\n    V. Consequences for the world of the achievement of the scheme\r\n    “From Hamburg to the Persian Gulf.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the Allies really wish, as their Governments have often proclaimed,\r\nto put an end to the peril of Prussian militarism, they must resolutely\r\nface the facts as they are, even when these are unpalatable to their\r\nself-esteem. They must understand fully that the chance of carrying out\r\nthe Pangerman plan rests in a large measure on the ignorance of the\r\nAllies. Berlin knew that before the war the countries now allied were\r\nunaware of the totally new face which within recent years has been put\r\non all the political problems of the Balkans and Austria-Hungary by the\r\nlabours of Pangermanism and the movement of nationalities. Undoubtedly\r\nthat ignorance of the Allies has been as minutely studied and appraised\r\nas were their military deficiencies; the conviction that the Allies\r\ndid not understand how to grapple with the situation has certainly\r\ncontributed to Berlin’s decision to unloose the dogs of war. Now, the\r\ndodge of the “Drawn Game,” the last trump of the Berlin Government, is a\r\nfresh gamble based on the ignorance of the Allies about foreign affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nThe dodge of the “Drawn Game” will be based on the following train of\r\nreasoning, which unquestionably prevails in Berlin:\r\n\r\n“The Allied diplomats have grasped neither our plan, nor our Pangerman\r\norganization, although that has required a preparation lasting twenty\r\nyears. The Allied diplomats have understood neither the true position of\r\nthe Balkans after the treaty of Bukarest (though that position was so\r\nfavourable to themselves), nor the importance of the Balkan forces for\r\nthe issue of the war. Still less do the Allied diplomats and the public\r\nof their respective countries know about the real state of affairs in\r\nAustria-Hungary. In France, and above all in England, a considerable\r\nproportion of the public continue to believe that Austria-Hungary is\r\nchiefly a German country, and that its more or less formal union with the\r\nEmpire is a natural and almost inevitable event. Therefore, if we are\r\ncompelled to give way in the East and in the West we may still, if we\r\nare clever, have a chance of achieving the third part of our Pangerman\r\nplan. The Allies will not understand the future danger in store for them\r\nif we carry out that part which is, indeed, the principal part of our\r\nscheme, namely, our designs on the South and South-East, symbolized by\r\nthe formula: From Hamburg to the Persian Gulf.”\r\n\r\nIndeed, the dodge of the “Drawn Game” aims at nothing less than at\r\nthat result. We must own that the German argument which has just been\r\nsummarized is not devoid of foundation; for up to now the Press of\r\nthe Allies has published articles on Austria-Hungary revealing a total\r\nmisconception of the facts, and they have thus unconsciously encouraged\r\nthe Pangerman project as regards the Hapsburg Monarchy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE DODGE CALLED THE “DRAWN GAME.”]\r\n\r\nIn the Allied Press, also, the expression: “Drawn Game” is currently\r\nemployed to mean that Germany might be considered as vanquished if she\r\nevacuates the now occupied territories in the East and in the West;\r\nbut nobody has yet pointed out with the necessary precision that the\r\nso-called “Drawn Game” would not be a draw at all, since it would allow\r\nGermany to effect enormous acquisitions, which would make her much more\r\npowerful than before the war.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the Allies ought not to be again the dupes of a German stratagem;\r\nwhich, if it succeeded, would involve consequences infinitely more\r\nserious than all the former errors of the Allies. To ward off that danger\r\nit suffices to look it full in the face and thoroughly to fathom what\r\nwould be the outcome of a peace negotiated on the so-called principle of\r\na “Drawn Game.”\r\n\r\nThe term “Drawn Game” evidently denotes that each country would keep the\r\nfrontiers which existed before the war; also that each country would\r\nbear the burden of the outlays it has made during the struggle. But we\r\nwill argue on a hypothesis infinitely more favourable for the Western\r\nAllies than that of the so-called “Drawn Game” in order to demonstrate\r\nsuper-abundantly and as decisively as possible what would be concealed\r\nbehind this apparent and partial German capitulation.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose (see map, p. 79) that, in consequence of victorious\r\noffensives of the Allies, Germany should declare herself disposed, not\r\nonly to evacuate totally Poland, the French Departments, Belgium, and\r\nLuxemburg, but also to restore Alsace-Lorraine to France, and even to\r\ngive, as an indemnity all the rest of the left bank of the Rhine, under\r\nthe sole and tacit condition that Germany should keep her preponderant\r\ninfluence, direct or indirect, over Austria-Hungary, the Balkans and\r\nTurkey.\r\n\r\nThere are surely in the Allied Western countries many worthy people who,\r\nat present, no more see the result of such a peace, than a year ago\r\nthey understood the enormous influences which the Balkans would exert\r\non the course of the war. These good creatures, weary of the prolonged\r\nstrife, would at once say: “After all, these are most acceptable terms:\r\nAlsace-Lorraine, the left bank of the Rhine!... let us make peace.”\r\n\r\nIf matters are probed to the bottom it will be easily seen that, should\r\nthe Allies negotiate peace with Germany on such a basis, the restitution\r\nof Alsace-Lorraine could only be temporary; for with such a peace as\r\nthat, Germany would secure all the elements of power which might enable\r\nher, after a very short respite, to retake Alsace-Lorraine, and in\r\nthe end to overcome all the Allies and to achieve in its entirety the\r\nPangerman plan, not only in Europe, but in Asia, nay in the whole world.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo relinquish the left bank of the Rhine, according to our hypothesis,\r\nwould mean for Germany that she would lose:\r\n\r\n                         Square\r\n    Provinces.         Kilometres.  Population.\r\n    Rhenish-Prussia      27,000      7,000,000\r\n    Rhenish-Bavaria      5,928       1,000,000\r\n    Alsace-Lorraine      14,522      2,000,000\r\n                         ------     ----------\r\n        Total            47,450     10,000,000\r\n\r\nThe present German Empire would therefore be reduced to 493,408 square\r\nkilometres and 58 million inhabitants. But this loss in the West would\r\nbe far more than counterbalanced by that close union of Austria-Hungary\r\nto the German Empire, which would be none the less real because it would\r\nbe disguised. On this reckoning Berlin’s influence would be exercised\r\ndirectly and absolutely over:\r\n\r\n                                          Square\r\n                                        Kilometres.  Population.\r\n    German Empire curtailed in the West    493,408    58,000,000\r\n    Austria-Hungary                        676,616    50,000,000\r\n                                         ---------   -----------\r\n        Total                            1,170,024   108,000,000\r\n\r\nIt is evident that a solid block of States, established in Central Europe\r\nunder the direction of Berlin, would exercise, simply by contiguity an\r\nabsolutely preponderant pressure on:\r\n\r\n                        Square\r\n                      Kilometres.   Population.\r\n\r\n    The Balkans          499,275    22,000,000\r\n    Turkey             1,792,900    20,000,000\r\n                       ---------    ----------\r\n        Total          2,292,175    42,000,000\r\n\r\nTherefore Berlin’s preponderant influence would be wielded, directly\r\nor indirectly, over 3,462,199 square kilometres and over 150 million\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\nWe now see clearly that in the end the dodge of the “Drawn Game” would\r\nlead in reality to an enormous increase of the German Empire, and to the\r\nachievement of the principal part of the Pangerman plan summarized in the\r\nformula “from Hamburg to the Persian Gulf” (p. 109 of original). What\r\nthen would be the general position of Great Germany thus constituted?\r\n\r\n“Having cut Europe in two, mistress of the Adriatic as well as of the\r\nNorth Sea, secure in her fleets and in her armies, Great Germany would\r\nbe an incubus on the world. Trieste, the Hamburg of the South, would\r\nfeed her in peace and revictual her in war. Her industry, equipped with\r\nplant of incomparable power, would flood with her wares those very\r\ncountries which she now schemes so artfully to monopolize:—Holland and\r\nBelgium, which are already penetrated; Hungary, her client; Roumania,\r\nher satellite; Bulgaria, a broken barrier; Bosnia and Herzegovina, the\r\nportals of the East. And, beyond the Bosphorus, Germany would reach\r\nAsia-Minor, that immense quarry of wealth. The huge German railroad\r\nprojected to run from Hamburg to the Persian Gulf without a break,\r\nwould link Berlin to the Far East. Then would the Emperor William’s\r\nBrobdingnagian dream be fulfilled. Germany would rule the world by her\r\nmight and by her commercial wealth. The state of things which then would\r\nexist might be described by slightly modifying what Metternich wrote\r\nof Napoleonic France: ‘The German system which to-day is triumphant is\r\ndirected against all the great states in their entirety, against every\r\npower able to maintain its own independence.’”\r\n\r\nSuch are the words which I published fifteen years ago in my book,\r\n_L’Europe et la Question d’Autriche au seuil du XXᵉ siècle, p. 353 (Plon,\r\nNourrit, editeurs, Paris)_. A careful study of the Pangerman plan of\r\n1895 had then convinced me that the whole future policy of Berlin would\r\ntend to carry out the plan laid down in the formula “from Hamburg to the\r\nPersian Gulf.” In what I then wrote a few minute discrepancies may now be\r\ndetected, but, unfortunately, the facts of to-day show that still on the\r\nwhole my words correspond exactly with events. The dodge of the “Drawn\r\nGame,” which the Germans keep up their sleeve, hoping still to profit by\r\nthe ignorance or the weariness of some of the Allies, would indeed have\r\nfor its indisputable object the achievement of that huge plan.\r\n\r\nThe terrible danger which this would bring upon the Allies will be better\r\nperceived (supposing they fall into the trap laid for them) when we shall\r\nhave demonstrated with precision, what would be the consequences for them\r\nif the scheme “from Hamburg to the Persian Gulf” were to succeed.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nIf we suppose for the sake of argument that the dodge of the “Drawn\r\nGame” were to succeed so far as to allow the Germans, by binding\r\nAustria-Hungary to the German Empire, to carry through their plan\r\n“from Hamburg to the Persian Gulf,” their success would involve certain\r\ngeneral financial consequences. These we must unfold, if we would clearly\r\nunderstand the full extent of the craft hidden under the cloak of that\r\nmanœuvre called the “Drawn Game,” which is still to be played.\r\n\r\nThe Germans having failed to crush the Allies, begin to think that the\r\nexpenses of war may possibly fall on themselves. The _Berlin Post_\r\nhas already calculated: “If we do not receive a war indemnity we must\r\nreckon on a yearly increase of taxes of at least four milliard marks,”\r\nbeing five milliard francs for 68 million inhabitants (_Le Temps_, 1st\r\nFebruary, 1916).\r\n\r\nThe disappointment is certainly keen for the Germans who counted on\r\nexacting from France alone an indemnity of 35 milliard francs; but we\r\nmust nevertheless fully understand that the dodge of the “Drawn Game”\r\n(which, for the sake of argument, we suppose to have succeeded) would\r\nplace Germany in a financial position vastly more advantageous than that\r\nof the Allies.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the cost of war has been much less for Germany than\r\nfor her adversaries. This is a point which must be fully considered,\r\nall the more because it helps to explain why the economic resistance of\r\nGermany is more prolonged than was generally expected.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of hostilities, Austro-German troops have lived at\r\nthe vast expense of enemy or Allied territories, such as Turkey and\r\nBulgaria, whose accumulated resources they slowly drain. Besides, in\r\nenemy countries, particularly in Belgium and in France, which are the\r\nrichest regions on earth, the Germans have collected a large amount of\r\nplunder. On Belgium alone they have levied a war contribution in specie\r\nof 480 million francs a year. Out of Belgium and France the Germans draw\r\nlarge quantities of coal and iron scot free. In both these countries they\r\nhave purloined raw goods, machines, furniture, valuables, representing\r\nthe value certainly of several milliard francs. In the French towns of\r\nthe Nord alone the Germans have stolen about 550 million francs worth\r\nof wool. Everywhere they have seized innumerable securities which they\r\nhave already tried to convert into money, though with small success, in\r\nthe United States. But if a complete victory did not compel the Germans\r\nto restore those bonds to the Allies who own them, some at least of them\r\nwould suffer a heavy loss of capital, by the mere fact of their warrants\r\nbeing detained; the effect of this would unavoidably react on the general\r\nwealth of the Allied countries. To these losses would probably be added\r\nthose of the numerous milliards of francs, lent by the French or English\r\nto Austria, to the Balkan States, and to Turkey, and represented by bonds\r\nwhich at present are, it is true, in Allied lands, but whose value would\r\nbecome exceedingly uncertain and hazardous the day that Germany ruled\r\nfrom Hamburg to the Persian Gulf. Teutonic good faith would then serve as\r\nthe only guarantee that dividends would be paid. The war, therefore, has\r\nput within Germany’s power not only vast territories which have enabled\r\nher to carry on the struggle with far less expense than the Allies, but\r\nalso the Germans have been able to lay their hands on enormous wealth,\r\nrepresenting tens of milliards of francs, which, being partly convertible\r\ninto specie, have reduced by that amount the direct financial war outlay\r\nof Germany.\r\n\r\nClearly, the Allies are not in an equal position.\r\n\r\nAlways supposing, for the sake of argument, that peace were concluded\r\nwith Berlin on the basis of the “Drawn Game,” each one of the Allies\r\nwould have to bear, without any reduction, the immense expenses incurred\r\nto maintain a war made by Germany. It is easy to perceive that these\r\nwar costs have been and are considerably higher for each of the Allies\r\nand more miscellaneous than has been the case for Germany. The Allies\r\nfound it necessary to improvise an enormous war plant under most costly\r\nconditions, while Germany had been able during peace, that is, under\r\nrelatively economical conditions, to produce all the material of her\r\nfighting equipment.\r\n\r\nThe Allies are bound to take care of and to maintain millions of refugees\r\nfrom invaded regions, whereas the Germans have only temporarily borne\r\nsuch a burden and merely for a small part of Eastern Prussia. After the\r\nwar, Belgium, Russia and especially France will have to provide for some\r\ntens of milliards of francs worth of extra charges for repairs of the\r\ncolossal damages done by the Germans in invaded territories, to private\r\npersons, State properties, railways, roads, etc. The Germans would not\r\nhave a similar outlay, at least not anything like in the same proportion.\r\nIn their conception of the “Drawn Game” the Germans certainly reckon\r\nthat these financial differences would almost ensure, after peace, the\r\nulterior impotence of the Allied countries as against Great Germany.\r\n\r\nWhat, for instance, would be the position of France if a war indemnity\r\nwere not paid to her? A few familiar figures, which everyone can check,\r\nwill enable us to form an opinion on that score. If the struggle lasts,\r\nlet us say, for two years, we can estimate at 50 milliards of francs\r\nthe direct outlay for France, and about 20 milliards would be required\r\nfor her indirect expenditure, that is, what must be paid after peace\r\nfor repairing the prodigious damage caused to individuals and to the\r\nState—remaking of roads, rebuilding of railways, etc., the total of the\r\nexpenses mounting up to some 70 milliards of francs. As the national debt\r\nof France, before the war, was 30 milliards of francs, it would therefore\r\nhave increased after peace to about 100 milliard francs.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand the budget of France in 1914 was in round figures\r\nfive milliard francs. The single item of the rise in price of daily\r\ncommodities will in itself inevitably be increased after war at least\r\nby 10%, therefore the budget after peace will require, let us say, an\r\ninitial increase of 500 million francs. On the other hand, this same\r\nbudget would have to bear interest at 5% on the 70 milliard francs of\r\nnewly incurred war debts; this would make a yearly outlay of 3,500\r\nmillion francs. Finally, it is clear that pensions to be given to the\r\nwounded, to widows of combatants, will burden the budget by a yearly\r\noutlay of at least a milliard francs. Probably even that figure will be\r\ninsufficient. Altogether the French budget of five milliard francs, as it\r\nwas in 1914, would have to be increased by about five milliard francs; in\r\nother words, it will have to be doubled. Already we well know that this\r\nfigure is much below what would be needed. And yet that enormous increase\r\nmakes no allowance for sums required to effect important social reforms,\r\nnor for the great improvements necessary to bring up the economic\r\nnational plant of France to a proper standard for resuming business\r\nactively.\r\n\r\nWe remember how hard it was in France before the war to find, by means\r\nof taxes, even the 500 million of francs needed for new expenditures.\r\nHow could we find annually an additional sum of five milliard francs\r\nof taxes in a country cruelly devastated by the struggle and where the\r\nre-organization of economic life would have to be complete? It is\r\nobvious that the most crushing taxes levied on every person would not\r\nsuffice for such a sum to be regularly raised.\r\n\r\nSuch a situation must inevitably tend to raise for the State and for\r\nevery Frenchman individually considerable financial difficulties. The\r\nsame would apply to economic undertakings. Thousands of these, at\r\npresent in the hands of shareholders or bond-holders, would be in a most\r\nprecarious condition, or the securities would be immensely depreciated.\r\nLanded property, overburdened by taxes and specially affected by the\r\nshortage of labour, would lose a great part of its value. This situation\r\nwould lead to a general rise in prices for the commodities of daily life,\r\nand that again would lay a fresh burden on the back of every Frenchman.\r\nThe financial position would be analogous for the Russians and for the\r\nEnglish, who of all the belligerents have spent most on the war.\r\n\r\nThe Germans, in trying their “Drawn Game” trick, reckon oil these\r\nfinancial consequences to reduce the Allies to ultimate impotence. The\r\nonly way to avoid this danger is to win that complete victory which all\r\nthe Allies desire, since it would enable them to impose on Germany the\r\npayment of the war indemnity which she unquestionably owes, as she is\r\nresponsible for the hostilities. Annuities paid to each of the Allies\r\nwill be used as the basis of loans, which will help to tide over the\r\nserious financial difficulties that infallibly await all the belligerents\r\nafter the war.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nThe menace involved in the scheme “from Hamburg to the Persian Gulf”\r\ncreates between the Allies in Europe, a common bond of interest, which is\r\nfar superior to their own individual interests, and which ought to keep\r\nthem firmly united to the end.\r\n\r\nFrance, England, Russia and Italy have an identical and an absolutely\r\nvital interest in defeating for ever the scheme of an empire that should\r\nreach from Hamburg to the Persian Gulf. This is quite apart from the\r\npurely humanitarian consideration that the numerous non-German peoples\r\nwho live between Bohemia and the Persian Gulf should not be finally\r\nsubservient to Germany. The achievement of the “Hamburg to the Persian\r\nGulf” scheme threatens all neutral states, for it would guarantee to\r\nGermany, as we shall see presently, her domination over the world.\r\n\r\nAlways on the supposition that this scheme succeeded, it would, regarded\r\nfrom the general economic point of view, place Germany in every respect\r\nin an infinitely superior position to that of the Allies. Her direct\r\nor indirect seizure of Austria-Hungary, of the Balkans and the Ottoman\r\nEmpire would secure for Germany an extraordinary economic power, against\r\nwhich all eventual combinations of the Allies would be impotent. The\r\nGerman dogged power of work, spirit of enterprise and organizing skill\r\nneed no further demonstration. We must therefore not doubt for a moment\r\nthat they would draw, to their enormous advantage, all possible profits\r\nfrom Austria-Hungary, vast regions of which can still be turned to\r\naccount. The same would apply to the Balkan countries, many of which are\r\nstill quite virgin, and contain, to a considerable extent, unexplored\r\nsources of wealth, both agricultural and mineral. This would also be true\r\nof Asiatic Turkey. As early as 1886 the German Orientalist, Dr. Spenger,\r\nstated: “Asia Minor is the only territory of the world which has not\r\nyet been monopolized by a Great Power. And yet it is the finest field\r\nfor colonization. If Germany does not miss the opportunity and seizes it\r\nbefore the Cossacks grab it, she will have secured the best part in the\r\ndivision of the world.”\r\n\r\nIt is an illusion to imagine that the Turks would seriously raise\r\nobstacles to the economic exploitation of their country by Germany. If\r\nthe Germans were masters of Central Europe and the Balkans, they would be\r\nin a position to sweep away all obstacles. The Prussian Pangermans are\r\nquite sure of it, thanks to their liege-men of Constantinople. This is\r\nproved sufficiently by the way in which the hereditary prince of Turkey,\r\nYussuf-Izzedin, was “suicided” at the end of January, 1916, because\r\nhe was anti-German. The Germans would perfectly understand the art of\r\nshowering, as hitherto, the amplest personal advantages on the handful of\r\nYoung Turks of Enver Pasha’s clique, while at the same time they would\r\ngrant such nominal concessions as would enable Berlin under the same to\r\nexploit thoroughly the Ottoman Empire.\r\n\r\nDo not let us be deceived, if the scheme “from Hamburg to the Persian\r\nGulf” succeeded, it would place in Berlin’s hands every element of a\r\nformidable economic power unprecedented in history. It would secure,\r\nin fact, to Germany the exclusive monopoly of economic influence on\r\nabout three million square kilometres of European and Asiatic lands\r\n(Austria-Hungary, Balkans, Turkey), and it would include, beside, the\r\nseizure of numerous strategical places of the highest importance (the\r\ncoasts of the Adriatic and the Ægean Sea, the Dardanelles, etc.).\r\n\r\nNow the permanence of these enormous advantages would be assured to\r\nGreat Germany through the expansion of Prussian militarism. For it must\r\nbe clearly understood—the point is essential—that Prussian militarism\r\nwould become considerably more powerful than it was in 1914, if the\r\nscheme “from Hamburg to the Persian Gulf” were achieved. Yet it is\r\nthe destruction of Prussian militarism which is the true, legitimate,\r\nand necessary object of the war, an object infinitely above any mere\r\nterritorial annexation whatsoever.\r\n\r\nThe increase of power which would accrue to Prussian militarism through\r\nthe accomplishment of the scheme “from Hamburg to the Persian Gulf” is\r\nreadily intelligible. The close attachment of Austria-Hungary to Germany,\r\nby placing under the immediate authority of the Headquarters Staff of\r\nBerlin a population of 108 millions, would enable it to mobilize at least\r\n10 millions of soldiers. Now, in virtue of the central geographical\r\nposition of the two empires, and of the network of Austro-German\r\nrailways, which would be brought to the highest degree of technical\r\nperfection, this immense army might, even more easily than to-day, be\r\nvery rapidly concentrated on any point of the periphery of the Germanic\r\nconfederation. But that is not all. The predominance of Berlin over\r\nthe Balkans and Turkey, by means of political alliances forced on the\r\nsatellite states of the South-East, would give in addition to the Berlin\r\nStaff control of 42 million inhabitants, that is to say, of about four\r\nmillions of soldiers.\r\n\r\nSupposing then that the mobilization applied to only ten per cent. of\r\nthe population, the accomplishment of the scheme “from Hamburg to the\r\nPersian Gulf” would place under the influence, direct or indirect, of\r\nthe Hohenzollerns, a total of about fifteen millions of soldiers. If the\r\nmobilization applied to fourteen per cent. of the population, which is\r\nthe proportion attained by Serbia and apparently by Austria-Hungary, the\r\nfigure would be 21 millions of soldiers.\r\n\r\nNow the course of the present war proves incontestably that the control\r\nof great military masses, placed in a single hand and elaborated as\r\nminutely as the Berlin Staff, forms a power infinitely greater than that\r\nof far more numerous masses under a control which is not sufficiently\r\nco-ordinated.\r\n\r\nHence the accomplishment of the scheme “from Hamburg to the Persian Gulf”\r\nwould place Germany in a military position considerably superior to that\r\nof all the Allied countries together.\r\n\r\nIn any case, those who are fighting for the purpose of putting an end\r\nto great armaments would find themselves once more plunged into the\r\nvortex of the most rigorous militarism, for they could not contend with\r\nGreat Germany except at the cost of formidable armaments, which would\r\nabsorb all their resources and all their attention. Now, would they be\r\nin a position to undertake such armaments in the infinitely difficult\r\nfinancial situation in which, according to hypothesis, they would stand?\r\n(see p. 86). Would they even have the resolution to undertake them, after\r\nthe frightful moral disappointment of their peoples, who would learn too\r\nlate the enormous mistake committed by their governments in negotiating\r\npeace on the basis of the so-called “Drawn Game,” which would have\r\nenabled Berlin to carry out its scheme of domination “from Hamburg to the\r\nPersian Gulf”?\r\n\r\nBesides, even if the Allies were willing to attempt once more the\r\noverthrow of the atrocious Prussian militarism, now much more oppressive\r\nthan before the war, Great Germany would certainly not give them time to\r\nprepare for it.\r\n\r\nWe may be quite sure that the day peace was concluded on the basis\r\nsupposed, Berlin would set about organizing economically and militarily,\r\nwith the utmost speed, the immense territory over which its supremacy\r\nwould be extended. Supposing that Russia, France, England and Italy were\r\ndisposed to renew the conflict, they would, in the assumed financial and\r\nmoral situation, be certainly reduced to impotence before they could make\r\nhead against the new German colossus.\r\n\r\nFinally, it would be ignoring completely the tenacity and ambition of\r\nthe Hohenzollerns to imagine that Great Germany, once mistress of an\r\nempire from Hamburg to the Persian Gulf, would sincerely renounce the\r\nambition of dominating the North Sea and the English Channel. Hence the\r\nevacuation of Belgium and the retrocession of Alsace-Lorraine, which on\r\nour hypothesis Germany would have yielded to France, would only have\r\nbeen temporary. The apparent capitulation of Berlin would have been,\r\ntherefore, nothing but a cunning device to allow Germany, driven almost\r\nto bay, to recover herself for a renewal of the struggle. Indeed, she\r\nis already preparing for it in union with her actual allies. _La Nation\r\nTchèque_, of 15th March, 1916, an excellent review edited by M. Ernest\r\nDenis, professor at the Sorbonne, brought to light the following fact.\r\nOn the 29th February, 1916, the Chamber of Commerce of Budapest met,\r\nall members being present, in order to study what measures to take for\r\na future war intended to complete the insufficient results of a peace,\r\nlooked upon as “imperfect.” In this discussion it was stated that with\r\nthe prospect of a fresh conflagration the States allied to Germany in the\r\npresent war must form an Economic Union.\r\n\r\nThus, already, the Hohenzollern are stirring up even their allies to\r\norganize the future conflagration which they will set ablaze if the\r\nAllies do not crush Prussian militarism. William II. and his Pangermans\r\nwant, at all costs, to carry out the scheme known as “from Hamburg to the\r\nPersian Gulf” because they know very well that the completion of that\r\nscheme, as we shall see presently, would suffice to provide them with\r\nall the means of afterwards accomplishing in its entirety their programme\r\nof universal domination.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nThe Pangerman plan of 1911 provides that the results of the “Hamburg to\r\nthe Persian Gulf” scheme should be made the most of even in the furthest\r\npoints of the Far East. Facts to hand and well-known Pangerman programmes\r\nenable us to form an idea of what help Germany meant to find in Asia\r\nduring the war, and what profit would have accrued to her afterwards from\r\nthe said scheme, if she had succeeded in finally carrying it out.\r\n\r\nWilliam II. tried to play the Panislamic card, which is one of the\r\nleading trumps of the Pangerman game. In a word, the object was to stir\r\nup a Panislamic movement, both political and military, which would help\r\nGermany to vanquish the Entente powers, since these hold among their\r\npossessions numerous Moslem subjects: France, particularly in Tunis,\r\nAlgiers and Morocco; Italy in Libya; Russia in the Crimea and in the\r\nCaucasus, in the region of Kazan, in Central Asia and in Siberia; England\r\nin Egypt, in India, in Burma, in the Straits Settlements and in the\r\ngreater part of her African Colonies.\r\n\r\nAs Panislamism is ostensibly founded on the restoration and considerable\r\nextension of the influence and powers of the Sultan of Constantinople,\r\nCommander of the Faithful, it could not fail to flatter deeply the\r\nneo-nationalism of the Turks, which has manifested itself particularly\r\nsince the failure of the Allies at the Dardanelles. The result is that,\r\nthanks to Panislamism, the Kaiser’s interests have been well served by\r\nthe Sultan’s Moslem subjects; a clever propaganda has dazzled their eyes\r\nwith a prospect of the restoration of a great empire, even greater than\r\nin days of old.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ASIATIC CONSEQUENCES OF THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THE SCHEME\r\n“FROM HAMBURG TO THE PERSIAN GULF.”]\r\n\r\nThe Panislamic movement, minutely and long prepared during peace by\r\nGermany, was started by her as soon as hostilities began. On the advice\r\nof Berlin, the Sultan proclaimed, as early as the end of 1914, the Jehad\r\nor Holy War. No doubt the Moslem insurrection has not become general,\r\nbut the Islamic agitation has nevertheless yielded local results, which\r\nwill be better understood after the war, and which have hampered the\r\nAllies in India, in Egypt, in Libya and in the French possessions of\r\nNorth Africa. Particularly in April, 1915, an insurrection of British\r\nIndian troops at Singapore very nearly succeeded. About the same time in\r\nSiam, numerous German officers, with the assistance of Indian and Burmese\r\nrevolutionaries, had begun to muster a small army of 16,000 men, who,\r\nafter being armed, were to attack British Burma. This Islamic agitation\r\nwas threatening to assume serious proportions, when the success of the\r\nRussians in Armenia and in Persia fortunately checked it by striking a\r\nheavy blow at the prestige of the Sultan, the Commander of the Faithful.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, what Berlin has already attempted to achieve with the help\r\nof Islam, should serve the Allies as a strong warning of what Germany\r\nwould certainly do in time to come, if the future peace left her the\r\nnecessary means. As soon as the Turco-German junction had been effected\r\nacross Serbia in October, 1915, the Panislamic policy of the Kaiser\r\nassumed a more decided form. At the behest of the Kaiser, his familiar\r\nspirit at Constantinople, Enver Pacha, who then was all-powerful,\r\nmobilized the whole of such of his Ottoman subjects as were able to\r\ncarry the arms provided for them, which only at the beginning of 1916\r\nbegan to pour in from the Central Empires, after communications had\r\nbeen established across invaded Serbia. At the same time, hundreds\r\nof thousands of Armenians were systematically massacred, in order to\r\neliminate a non-Moslem population, which thwarted the Turco-German\r\nplans for the future. As to the military and Panislamic activity of\r\nthe Turks, directed by the Germans, it has endeavoured to radiate from\r\nConstantinople in many directions towards Egypt, the Caucasus, Persia,\r\nCentral-Russian Asia, Afghanistan and India.\r\n\r\nAfter the war, if by our hypothesis, peace were made on the basis of a\r\n“Drawn Game,” that is to say, if the scheme “from Hamburg to the Persian\r\nGulf” were carried out, all these other plans would be taken up again.\r\nHow would the Turks free themselves from the German clutches? Their\r\nfinancial position binds them entirely to Germany. Such large personal\r\nadvantages as the Kaiser’s agents would inevitably offer to all Turks\r\nwhose help would be considered useful, would suffice to ensure Berlin’s\r\npredominance in the Sultan’s Empire, that classical land of backsheesh\r\n(_see_ map, p. 95).\r\n\r\nNow, there are in Persia, in the Azerbijan, about 400,000 men who would\r\nmake quite useful soldiers, and who would provide what is necessary\r\nfor an offensive against Russia; in Afghanistan 500,000 first class\r\ncombatants would be found. Once armed they could be let loose in Northern\r\nIndia, which contains about 50 million Moslems. These, so far, have\r\ncollectively remained loyal to Great Britain, but their feelings might be\r\nsubject to a change if, as a fact, Germany appeared to be victorious by\r\nremaining mistress of the route from Hamburg to the Persian Gulf. Hence\r\nwe conclude that very soon after a peace negotiated on such a basis, the\r\nEnglish and the Russians might have to face very grave difficulties.\r\n\r\nThat is not all; German propaganda has extended to the whole of China\r\nby various means. First of all the 20 to 30 million Moslems who dwell\r\nin the Celestial Empire, have been worked up by Turco-German agents in\r\nthe same way as the Moslem population in other Islamic regions. But\r\nas the Chinese Moslems are geographically not well grouped to form a\r\nsufficiently powerful basis for the German agitation, the latter has\r\nfastened on the vital and motor organs of China. The German agents have\r\nbought in China, as elsewhere, all the newspapers which could be utilized\r\nfor their object, particularly the _Peking Post_, written in English,\r\nand the Chinese review, _Hsie-Ho-Pao_. They have also made use of the\r\n_Ostasiatische Lloyd_, which was published at Tien-Tsin before the war.\r\nSince its outbreak they have founded the _German China Gazette_. All\r\nthese organs have propagated everywhere in the Celestial Empire the\r\ndoctrine of German invincibility. Thanks to this, says the _Frankfurter\r\nZeitung_, “every coolie knows by now that Germany is victorious.”\r\n\r\nFor the moment the policy which Germany pursues in China consists in\r\nstirring up everywhere trouble and unrest. In Northern China it upholds\r\nthe President Yuan-Shi-Kai.[2] In his set the Germans have gained\r\nnumerous followers. Thanks to their influence, German officers already\r\noccupy very important posts in the Chinese army. But in Southern China,\r\nGermany is rousing the populations against the authority of Yuan-Shi-Kai.\r\nThe aim of Berlin in this apparent contradictory policy, is to create\r\nsuch a position in China that it will engross the attention of Japan,\r\nand prevent her from intervening with her troops in Europe; such an\r\nintervention has been already contemplated and would be still possible.\r\n\r\nThe present Berlin policy in the Celestial Empire has also for its object\r\nto prepare the German policy of the future in the Far East. When once\r\npeace is concluded, on the basis on which she counts, Germany would\r\npursue in China exactly the same policy which she intends to pursue\r\nin Turkey. Then Berlin will say to the Chinese, as she now says to\r\nthe Turks, “See, we are bold financiers, enterprising manufacturers,\r\nenergetic business men. We will help you to turn your country to account.\r\nWe shall procure for you the experts whom you need. We will give you the\r\nmeans of defending yourselves against your neighbours. We, who are the\r\nfinest soldiers in the world, will bring up to a proper standard your\r\nendless and magnificent military forces, now in embryo. With your 300\r\nmillions of inhabitants you can be the absolute rulers of all Asia. We\r\nwill, therefore, build up for you a formidable army and a very powerful\r\nnavy.”\r\n\r\nIt is easy to perceive what is hidden behind this programme, with its\r\nobvious attraction for the Chinese. In reality, it is a preparation for\r\nthe seizure by Germany of part of China, and her economic exploitation\r\nunder exactly the same conditions and by the same measures as those\r\nalready employed in Turkey. Moreover, this policy is a signal vengeance\r\nwhich Germany means to wreak in the future on Japan after the victory of\r\nwhich she thinks herself assured. No doubt, in order to break the union\r\nof her adversaries, Berlin has already hinted to Tokio the idea of a\r\nseparate peace, but that is merely a piece of tactics exacted by the need\r\nof the moment.\r\n\r\nNever would a Great Germany, mistress of the route from Hamburg to the\r\nPersian Gulf, and exercising a predominant influence in China, forgive\r\nJapan for having driven her out of Kiao-Chau. Now, if and when an immense\r\nChinese army shall have been created, under the direction of German\r\nofficers, Japan, in spite of the bravery of her soldiers, would at once\r\nbe unable to avoid the consequences of the intolerable situation in which\r\nshe would be placed through the relative smallness of her population (70\r\nmillions, with her colonies, against 300 millions of Chinese). Japan is,\r\ntherefore, directly aimed at by the scheme of domination from Hamburg to\r\nthe Persian Gulf, which really endangers her future.\r\n\r\nFinally, we can see that thanks to a combination of Panislamism and a\r\nChinophile policy, at least one that is outwardly so, the achievement\r\nof the scheme of domination from Hamburg to the Persian Gulf, would\r\nassure to Germany the means not only of dominating Europe, but also of\r\nexercising a preponderant influence over the whole of Asia. After having\r\nobtained for herself in Europe the possibility of drawing exclusive\r\nprofit from strategic positions of inestimable value, such as the shores\r\nof the Adriatic, the Ægean, and the Dardanelles, Germany would be\r\nmistress, by mere force of circumstances, of the Suez Canal and would\r\ncommand besides numerous vantage points on the Chinese coasts. Thus the\r\ndefeat of the “Hamburg to the Persian Gulf” project is a vital question\r\nnot only for France, England, Russia, and Italy, but also for Japan.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nIn order to demonstrate the really extraordinary importance of the\r\nscheme “from Hamburg to the Persian Gulf,” we have still to show how\r\nits achievement would not only make Germany mistress in Europe and\r\npreponderant in Asia, but would carry with it the accomplishment of the\r\nPangerman plan in its world-wide form. The world-wide elements of this\r\nplan, graphically shown on the map herewith, have been set forth in the\r\nbook of Otto Richard Tannenberg, _The Greater Germany, the Work of the\r\n20th Century_,[3] which appeared at Leipsic in 1911. As this book, which\r\n_bearing date 1911_, contains the exact programme of the seizures to be\r\neffected in Europe and Turkey, nine-tenths of which the German General\r\nStaff has already carried out to the letter, the exceptional importance\r\nof Tannenberg’s book is indisputable. It is demonstrated, in fact, that\r\nthe annexations and seizures which he advocated in 1911 correspond as\r\ncompletely as possible with the execrable ambitions of the government of\r\nBerlin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WORLD-WIDE CONSEQUENCES OF THE “HAMBURG TO THE PERSIAN\r\nGULF” SCHEME, AS PROVIDED FOR BY THE PLAN OF 1911.]\r\n\r\nAs for the territorial acquisitions which Tannenberg advocates in Asia,\r\nin Africa, in Oceania, and in America, they would be the perfectly\r\nlogical consequences of the accomplishment of the “Hamburg to the Persian\r\nGulf” project. If that project became a reality, it would be because the\r\nEuropean Allies, through their blunders in the management of the war,\r\nwould have had to forego the notion of beating Germany and to leave the\r\nGerman General Staff to command an army of from 15 to 21 millions of men\r\n(see p. 91). Therefore, it is obvious that on this hypothesis the Allied\r\npeoples, after a treacherous peace, morally and financially exhausted,\r\nhaving to face the formidable armies of Pangermany, would be unable to\r\noppose the accomplishment of those colonial schemes, which the success of\r\nthe “Hamburg to the Persian Gulf” plan would afford to Great Germany the\r\nmeans of carrying out, since, always on the assumption in question, they\r\nwould have given way on an issue much more vital for them—that of the\r\nindependence of Europe.\r\n\r\nOnce grant this supposition, and we shall be convinced that Tannenberg’s\r\nworld-wide plan of Pangerman annexations is quite stripped of that\r\nchimerical character which at first sight we might be disposed to ascribe\r\nto it.\r\n\r\nBesides, we must add that the programme, which is fully described below,\r\nwas drawn up by Tannenberg on the supposition, on which the Berlin\r\nGovernment also reckoned, that England would not take part in the war.\r\nIn order to purchase her neutrality, Tannenberg advocated dividing the\r\ncolonies of the other European powers between London and Berlin. But now\r\nthat England has thrown herself into the struggle, it is clear that,\r\nassuming Germany to be victorious, she would take possession also of\r\nthose colonies which Tannenberg proposed to assign to Great Britain,\r\nsince Britain would be incapable of resisting. It follows that the\r\nworld-wide acquisitions of Pangermany, sketched in the plan of 1911 and\r\nsummarized below, are in fact less than Germany would be able to effect,\r\nsince having presumably accomplished the scheme of domination “from\r\nHamburg to the Persian Gulf,” no organized force on earth would be\r\npowerful enough to curb the boundless ambition of Berlin.\r\n\r\nWe have proved above that if the Allies allowed Germany to secure her\r\nhold on Austria-Hungary, the predominant and exclusive influence of\r\nBerlin over all the Balkans and Turkey would be inevitable. Tannenberg\r\n(_op. cit._, p. 323) explains that finally Asia Minor, Syria, and\r\nMesopotamia, Palestine, Western Persia, and the larger part of Arabia\r\nwould pass under the absolute protectorate of the German Empire, making a\r\ntotal of, say, 3,200,000 square kilometres and 16,500,000 inhabitants.\r\n\r\nOnce masters of the coasts of the Adriatic, the Ægean, the Dardanelles,\r\nand Aden, helped by the Panislamic propaganda, the Turco-German seizure\r\nof Egypt, and therefore the Suez Canal, would necessarily follow.\r\nGermany, if she commanded these essential strategical points, would then\r\nobviously be able to retake her colonies in Africa and Oceania.\r\n\r\n                                     Square         Native\r\n                                   Kilometres.

As we have seen (p. 99),\r\nthe Berlin plan consists first in arming China powerfully enough under\r\nthe orders of German officers, to expel the Japanese from Kiao-Chau and\r\nfrom the province of Shantung. Germany would thus inflict a first and\r\nstriking vengeance on the Empire of the Rising Sun. But that would not\r\nbe all. The policy which Berlin foreshadows with regard to China is\r\nidentical with the one which it is now pursuing in Turkey. If Germany\r\narmed China, it would be under conditions such that the Celestial Empire\r\nwould have to submit to the strict influence of Pangermany. Tannenberg\r\n(_op. cit._, p. 321) tells us that the outcome of these tactics would\r\nbe the establishment of a vast zone of special German influence on the\r\nwhole lower course of the Yangtse-Kiang and the Hoangho, that is to say,\r\nover that vast portion of China which forms the hinterland of Kiao-Chau,\r\nmaking a total of about 750,000 square kilometres and 50 millions of\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\nTannenberg finally gives an exact enumeration of the various German\r\nprotectorates which would be established in the southern part of South\r\nAmerica, where dwell many German colonists, whose aggressive tendencies\r\nare already plain enough. “Germany,” says Tannenberg literally, “takes\r\nunder her protection the republics of Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay,\r\nthe southern third of Bolivia, so far as it belongs to the basin of the\r\nRio de la Plata, together with that part of southern Brazil, in which\r\nGerman culture is dominant” (_op. cit._, p. 321).\r\n\r\n                              Square\r\n                            Kilometres.

Chili and Argentina will preserve their language and\r\ntheir autonomy. But we shall require that in the schools German shall be\r\ntaught as a second language. Southern Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay are\r\ncountries of German culture. German will there be the national tongue”\r\n(_op. cit._, p. 337).\r\n\r\nEven during the war, Germany has laid the train for some of these\r\nexplosions. The Chicago _Tribune_ has learned that the Committee of\r\nForeign Affairs for the Senate of the United States possesses the proofs\r\nof German intrigues carried on in the American hemisphere in defiance of\r\nthe Monroe doctrine (_Le Temps_, 16th February, 1916). These official\r\nPangerman machinations, proved up to the hilt and entirely in harmony\r\nwith Tannenberg’s American plan of campaign, demonstrate the identity of\r\nhis colonial views with those of the government of Berlin.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, the result of the Pangerman programme for countries outside\r\nof Europe would be to assure to Germany, under the form of colonies,\r\nprotectorates, or zones of special influence:\r\n\r\n                            Square\r\n                          Kilometres.    Population.\r\n\r\n    In Asia                 4,753,000    83,490,000\r\n    In Africa               8,906,000    46,850,000\r\n    In Oceania              2,314,000    38,841,000\r\n    In America              6,347,000    18,197,000\r\n                           ----------   -----------\r\n        Making a total of  22,320,000   187,378,000\r\n\r\nGermany, which occupied or controlled, at the beginning of 1916, in\r\nEurope, 3,576,237 square kilometres, including the Empire, and more\r\nthan 160 millions of inhabitants, would then have a universal domain of\r\ninfluence reaching over 25,896,237 square kilometres and 347 millions of\r\ninhabitants. This figure includes at the utmost 90 millions of Germans;\r\ntherefore, these will exercise their supremacy over 257 millions of\r\nnon-Germans.\r\n\r\nIt must be clearly understood also that the enormous possessions of\r\nPangermany in both hemispheres would be thoroughly under the domination\r\nof Berlin; indeed, a glance at the map (p. 101) will show that the\r\nuniversal Pangerman plan aims at seizing all the essential strategic\r\npoints which command the seas of the world, especially, in addition\r\nto those already mentioned, the Straits of Gibraltar from the side of\r\nMorocco, Cape Horn, Madagascar, and all the naval bases of Oceania.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, the complete Pangerman plan aims at procuring for Germany all\r\nthe means of domination by land and sea, which would enable Pangermany to\r\nhold the entire world in the dreadful hug of Prussian militarism screwed\r\nup to its highest degree of power.\r\n\r\nNot for a moment do the Pangermans pause to reflect how criminal is\r\nthis programme of universal slavery. “War,” says Tannenberg, with his\r\nmonstrous cynicism, “must leave nothing to the vanquished but their\r\neyes to weep with. Modesty on our part would be purely madness” (_op.\r\ncit._, p. 304). Now, it is a fundamental truth, of which I should like\r\nto convince my readers, that the universal Pangerman plan is solely\r\nand wholly based on the achievement of the scheme “from Hamburg to the\r\nPersian Gulf,” which forms its backbone. If this is broken, the whole\r\nof the Pangerman plan falls to the ground, and the projects of Prussian\r\ndomination are destroyed for ever. The principal problem which the Allies\r\nhave to solve, if they wish to ensure their liberty and that of the whole\r\nworld, is to make impossible the achievement of the plan “from Hamburg\r\nto the Persian Gulf.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE CRUCIAL POINT OF THE WHOLE PROBLEM.\r\n\r\n    I. The obligation which the threat of the scheme “from Hamburg\r\n    to the Persian Gulf” imposes on the Allies.\r\n\r\n    II. The capital importance of the question of Austria-Hungary.\r\n\r\n    III. All the racial elements necessary for the destruction of\r\n    the Pangerman plan exist in Central Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nNow that they have laid their hands on nine-tenths of the territories\r\nwhich they coveted (see p. 63), the Germans will only give in at the last\r\nextremity. Maximilian Harden has peremptorily declared: “Every means will\r\nbe enthusiastically employed against her enemies by the German people. We\r\nwill go back to the times of savagery when man was a wolf for his fellow\r\nman” (quoted by _Le Temps_, 9th February, 1916). In face of this firm\r\nresolution of the Germans to achieve at all costs the plan of universal\r\ndomination, a plan of which the “Hamburg to the Persian Gulf” project is\r\nthe necessary and sufficient backbone, the real destruction of Prussian\r\nmilitarism becomes more than ever a duty. Only this result can repay the\r\nsacrifices of the admirable “Tommies” of the Allied armies. If they are\r\ndetermined to hold on as long as necessary, it is not to cover themselves\r\nwith military glory; it is to acquire the certainty “that it shall not\r\nbegin again, that their children shall not know horrors like those of the\r\nhellish struggle initiated by Prussianized Germany.”\r\n\r\nThe Allies will certainly issue as conquerors from this dreadful war,\r\nbut on condition that in future the struggle should be directed by the\r\nlessons of experience. These essential lessons are the outcome of the\r\ngeographical, ethnographical, economic, and strategical elements which\r\nconstitute the Pangerman plan of 1911, temporarily accomplished. Now,\r\nthese lessons of experience show that the Allies could not possibly\r\nbe content with a half-and-half victory; a complete victory alone can\r\nguarantee them against any aggressive revival, after peace, of Prussian\r\nmilitarism.\r\n\r\nThe following considerations appear strongly to justify this opinion:\r\n\r\n“If in France,” declares Harden, “they think that the re-establishment of\r\npeace can only be made possible by the restoration of Alsace-Lorraine,\r\nand if necessity should oblige us to sign such a peace, the 70 millions\r\nof Germans would very soon tear that peace to tatters” (quoted by _Le\r\nTemps_, 9th February, 1916). Is there a single living Frenchman of sense\r\nwho would be willing to recover Alsace-Lorraine under such conditions\r\nthat it would be necessary afterwards to make incessant and exhausting\r\nmilitary efforts in order to keep the restored provinces? Certainly\r\nnot. The restoration of Alsace-Lorraine will only become of value for\r\nFrance when the annihilation of Prussian militarism shall guarantee her\r\na legitimate and peaceful possession of the territories in question.\r\nNow, as I think I have proved, it would be impossible to reckon on this\r\nsecurity if France allowed Berlin to carry out the scheme “from Hamburg\r\nto the Persian Gulf,” which would furnish Germany with superabundant\r\nmeans to retake Alsace-Lorraine after a short respite.\r\n\r\nThe imperious necessity of avoiding financial ruin further forces the\r\nAllies to seek a complete victory. Indeed, such a victory alone will\r\nenable them to escape the most frightful impoverishment, which otherwise\r\nthreatens the Allied States and their citizens. The fabulous expenses\r\nwhich the present war necessitates distinguish it, financially speaking,\r\nby a vast gulf from all the wars that have gone before.\r\n\r\nAfter 1870, France was able very quickly to recover her position, and\r\nin spite of the misfortunes of the country, individuals were able, on\r\nthe morrow of the peace, to promote the prosperity of their business.\r\nBut after the present war, if the Allies did not win a complete victory,\r\nour States, like our individuals (see p. 88), would be faced by almost\r\ninextricable pecuniary difficulties. The endless economic consequences\r\nresulting from crushing taxes, which could not be regularly and\r\npermanently collected, would be such that the States and most individuals\r\nin the Allied countries would see themselves reduced to impotence and\r\ntherefore to poverty. This, however, is truly the situation with which\r\nthe Allies would be confronted if Germany were to achieve her plan of\r\ndomination “from Hamburg to the Persian Gulf,” since that solution would\r\nenable her to retain her enormous spoils of war and to lay hands on\r\nconsiderable sources of wealth (see p. 85).\r\n\r\nNow, would it not be a monstrous iniquity that the people of France,\r\nEngland, Russia, and Italy should be reduced for tens of years to\r\nterrible poverty because it suited the execrable ambition of the\r\nHohenzollerns to reduce Europe to slavery?\r\n\r\nOnly a complete victory can save the Allied countries from financial\r\nruin, because, no matter what some people say, Germany will be able to\r\npay the cost of the struggle she has initiated. As she is responsible\r\nfor the war, Germany already owes to the united Allies a colossal sum\r\nwhich can be estimated roundly at between 250 and 300 milliards of\r\nfrancs. But if the credit of the German Empire is doomed to disappear\r\non the day of her defeat, the material riches of Germany, which are very\r\nconsiderable, will continue. They represent much more than 300 milliards\r\nof francs. Of course Germany will only be able to pay her fabulous\r\ndebt very gradually. But when means for collecting the German revenues\r\nshall have been systematically and leisurely studied by the conquering\r\nAllies, when these collections of revenue shall have become assured, of\r\ncourse not by written German promises, worthless scraps of paper, but\r\nby real guarantees in harmony with those precedents of history, which\r\nthe government of Berlin strongly contributed to establish in 1870,\r\nGermany will be perfectly able to hand to each of the great conquering\r\nAllies about two milliards of francs a year. This annuity, thanks to\r\nmodern financial combinations, will be sufficient to allow each Allied\r\nstate to raise annual loans at relatively low rates and therefore easily\r\nprocurable; and these will permit each State to spare its citizens the\r\nburden of taxes which would be not only crushing but fatal, and which\r\nwould be inevitable if the country had to relinquish the hope of being\r\nrecouped for its war expenses by Germany.\r\n\r\nNow, a truly complete victory like this, which is indispensable from so\r\nmany points of view to the Allies, is perfectly possible in spite of the\r\nfaults committed by the Allies, which alone have delayed it.\r\n\r\nA line of argument will set this possibility in a proper light. Harden\r\nhimself has been constrained, as we have already seen, to face the\r\nhypothesis of a cession of Alsace-Lorraine to France. It is obvious that\r\nwhen they have come to that pitch at Berlin, it will mean that Germany\r\nat bay, on the brink of absolute disaster, will try to negotiate with\r\nthe Allies in order to save her plan of domination “from Hamburg to the\r\nPersian Gulf.” This would enable her, after a short respite, to recover\r\nAlsace-Lorraine from France, as Harden also indicates. Therefore, the\r\neffort needed at the present moment, if the Allies wish to secure a\r\ncomplete instead of a doubtful victory, which in reality would mean for\r\nthem a catastrophe, would be comparatively slight. That effort would\r\nprobably only represent the hundredth part of all those already made by\r\nthe Allies. We should be mad or criminal not to make it, because it is\r\nthat last effort which will put an end to the horrible nightmare conjured\r\nup all over the world by Prussian militarism.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn order to make sure of this complete victory, we need only draw the\r\nappropriate lesson from the mistakes that have been made. As M. Briand\r\nsaid in Rome, the solidarity of the Allies should be closer than ever.\r\n“They ought to pool all their resources, all their energies, all their\r\nvital forces.” But that co-ordination of the efforts of the Allies, which\r\nis called for on every side, would be greatly facilitated, if the common\r\nobjective of the common action of all the Allies were thenceforth clearly\r\ndefined in its geographical, military, and political aspects.\r\n\r\nThe German aggression took the Allies by surprise, and their first duty\r\nwas to resist it. Afterwards, through the mere force of circumstances,\r\nthe operations of each of them were directed mainly to the particular\r\nobjects which each had in view. England and France have reasons of honour\r\nand of interest for defending the absolute independence of Belgium.\r\nFrance must recover its invaded departments and liberate Alsace-Lorraine.\r\nRussia must not only reconquer its frontiers on the West, but free the\r\nwhole of Poland, to which she has promised autonomy. The empire of the\r\nTsars must also put an end, once for all, to the Turco-German menace on\r\nthe south of the Caucasus. Italy must recover her lost lands—_Italia\r\nirredenta_—from the clutch of the Hapsburgs. But all these particular\r\nobjects, however legitimate and necessary, have long prevented the Allies\r\nfrom seeing the war in its European dimensions, and have therefore\r\ndiverted their attention from what, alike from the geographical, the\r\nmilitary, and the political point of view, should be the common objective\r\nof all their efforts, an objective of supreme importance, since its\r\nattainment would deliver them at once from the menace of the “Hamburg\r\nto the Persian Gulf” project, which threatens all the Allies alike; and\r\nby striking a decisive blow at Prussian militarism it would assure the\r\naccomplishment and the permanence of the practical results aimed at by\r\neach of the Allies individually.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CRUCIAL POINT OF THE EUROPEAN PROBLEM.]\r\n\r\nNow this common objective, this geographical, military and political\r\ncrux of all the problems which the Allies have to solve, is represented\r\nby Austria-Hungary. On that subject the diplomacy of the Allies, thanks\r\nagain to M. Briand and his colleagues, appears to have entered on the\r\nright path. The _Matin_ of 4th February, 1916, reported the reception by\r\nM. Briand of Professor Masaryk, one of the most highly esteemed leaders\r\nof Bohemia. In reference to this meeting the _Matin_ added the following\r\nsignificant words, which deserve to be borne in mind: “M. Briand\r\nencouraged M. Masaryk to persevere in his propaganda, and expressed to\r\nhim his good wishes and his sympathy with the legitimate claims of the\r\nCzech-Slovak people.” But Bohemia is the corner-stone of that group\r\nof non-German peoples included in Austria-Hungary, whose independence\r\nis one of the conditions indispensable to the destruction of Prussian\r\nmilitarism. Therefore public opinion in the Allied countries should\r\nhenceforth clearly understand the close relation which, as I have shown\r\nabove, exists between the little understood question of Austria-Hungary\r\nand the end of the Pangerman nightmare. It will then have a fresh and\r\nextremely powerful reason for the conviction, that the complete victory,\r\nwhich the Pangerman plan renders indispensable for the Allies, cannot\r\nfail to be theirs, provided they set their heart on it and avoid further\r\nmistakes.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nIn Austria-Hungary lies the crucial point of the European and even of the\r\nworld-wide problem raised by the German aggression, because:\r\n\r\n1. Austria-Hungary has entered into the struggle in very peculiar\r\ncircumstances. This State is not an enemy of the Allies, except at the\r\nbidding of the Hapsburg dynasty, which, by yielding to the injunctions\r\nof Berlin, has betrayed its own peoples. In fact, Francis Joseph declared\r\nwar without even daring to consult his parliament, for he knew very well\r\nthat nearly three-fourths of his subjects, sympathizing with Russia,\r\nFrance, and England, and being definitely hostile to Germany, would have\r\nopposed, by the voice of their representatives, any sanguinary conflict\r\ndestined to turn to the advantage of Germanism.\r\n\r\n2. It is manifest that Germany cannot maintain a war against Europe\r\nexcept with the help of the Austro-Hungarian soldiers, whom she has\r\ndexterously contrived to enlist in her cause, and of whom the vast\r\nmajority only fight because they are forced to do so by the brutal German\r\nStaff Officers who command them.\r\n\r\n3. It is clear that after the peace, if Germany were to evacuate all\r\nthe territories she now occupies in the East and the West, to restore\r\nAlsace-Lorraine to France, and yet to keep her hold, more or less\r\ndisguised, on Austria-Hungary, Berlin would possess all the means for\r\nretaking, after a short delay, Alsace-Lorraine from France, since, as\r\nwe saw in the foregoing chapter, the German hold on Austria-Hungary\r\ninevitably implies the accomplishment of the scheme “from Hamburg to the\r\nPersian Gulf.”\r\n\r\n4. From this last consideration it follows that if after the peace\r\nGermany were to retain her disguised hold on Austria-Hungary, the solemn\r\npromise given by France, England, and Russia, to re-establish Serbia in\r\nits independence and its integrity, would be practically incapable of\r\nfulfilment.\r\n\r\n5. On the contrary, if the freedom from German control of at least the\r\nmajority of the Austro-Hungarian territories were assured after the\r\npeace, this would absolutely prevent for the future any aggressive\r\nrevival of Prussian militarism. For by the very fact of that independence\r\nthe General Staff of Berlin would be deprived of troops which are\r\nindispensable to the forcible execution of the Pangerman projects.\r\n\r\n6. A glance at the map (p. 113) will show that in virtue of their\r\ngeographical situation nothing but the freedom of the majority of the\r\nAustro-Hungarian territories from German control could enable the Allies\r\nto keep their promises to Serbia, and, by definitely breaking the\r\nbackbone of the Pangerman plan, to prevent the immense danger of the\r\n“Hamburg to the Persian Gulf” plan, the accomplishment of which all the\r\nAllies, without any exception (France, England, Russia, Italy, Japan,\r\nBelgium, Serbia, Montenegro) have a really vital interest to prevent.\r\nBut, as we shall see at the end of the volume, their interest in this\r\nmatter is also the interest of the whole civilized world.\r\n\r\nThe fact that public opinion in the Allied countries is not yet fully\r\nalive to the capital, the essential importance of the Austro-Hungarian\r\nquestion for the issue of the war and the future of Europe, is due to a\r\nvariety of causes which must be enumerated.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the question of Austria-Hungary, an empire composed\r\nof very complex racial and social elements, is undoubtedly very difficult\r\nto grasp.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, the lamentable want of interest in foreign affairs,\r\nwhich before the war prevailed in the Allied countries, is responsible\r\nfor the extreme inaccuracy of those current beliefs on the subject, which\r\nthe German press agents have successfully palmed off on the newspapers of\r\nthe present Allies.\r\n\r\nAs a result, many people in these countries, especially in England, still\r\nimagine that Austria-Hungary, with a population of fifty millions, is\r\na country mainly German, which is a radically false idea. This serious\r\nmistake is sometimes made, to my knowledge, even by men occupying very\r\nimportant posts.\r\n\r\nEvidently a large part of the public is no longer quite so ignorant as\r\nthat. Nevertheless, even for them the Austro-Hungarian question is still\r\nfull of obscurities. Need we wonder at it? The official diplomatists\r\nthemselves in general, whatever their personal intelligence, have been\r\nable to acquire but a very superficial insight into the internal affairs\r\nof the Hapsburg empire. The reasons for the deficiency have been already\r\nset forth (Chapter I., § 3); they include the old-fashioned means of\r\nobservation and information which the diplomatists have been constrained\r\nto employ.\r\n\r\nFinally, the learned men who have studied Austria-Hungary only as\r\nhistorians, that is to say, as foreigners and in books, whatever their\r\nqualifications, have not been able to acquaint themselves with the exact\r\ninternal condition of the country, which has been completely transformed,\r\nespecially within the last ten years. But it is just this present\r\ncondition which it is important, and alone important, to comprehend.\r\n\r\nThis want of clear notions on the Hapsburg empire involves a very great\r\ndanger for the Allies. It has contributed largely to the very grave\r\nmistakes which they have made in the general conduct of the war. An end\r\nmust be put to this ignorance. In regard to Austria-Hungary the Allies\r\nmust on no account continue to commit such a series of blunders as those\r\nwhich made up their policy towards the Balkans. Their punishment for such\r\nrepeated mistakes would be even more severe than it has been.\r\n\r\nThe only way of avoiding these mistakes is to listen to the opinions\r\nof the few men, citizens of the Allied states, who in recent years, in\r\nvirtue of their thorough-going studies and of their extensive travels in\r\nthe whole of Austria-Hungary, have been able to acquire a really exact\r\nand general knowledge of the facts as they are at present.\r\n\r\nThose who possess these qualifications are far from numerous. I will\r\nmention first two Russians: M. de Wesselitsky, correspondent of the\r\n_Novoe Vremya_ in London, who knows not only Austria-Hungary, but\r\nall Europe, and has very profound views; and M. Briantchaninoff, of\r\nPetrograd. I know that in official circles the ideas of the latter\r\ngentleman are deemed too violent or extreme, but he is one of the\r\nfew Russians who have travelled much for the purpose of acquainting\r\nthemselves with foreign affairs. A very intelligent Liberal and a\r\nclearsighted man, he has for a very long time advocated the concession\r\nby Russia of the largest and the most genuine autonomy to Poland. His\r\nopinion with regard to Austria-Hungary, which he has often visited,\r\ndeserves to be listened to.\r\n\r\nTwo Englishmen in particular possess an excellent knowledge of the\r\nHapsburg empire: Mr. Wickham Steed, foreign editor of _The Times_, who\r\nwas for ten years the remarkable correspondent of that powerful organ\r\nat Vienna; Mr. Seton-Watson, who, under the name of _Scotus Viator_,\r\nhas published, within the last ten years, the results of his manifold\r\ninquiries in works of the highest value dealing with the nationalities\r\nsubject to the German-Magyar yoke.\r\n\r\nIn France we find M. Louis Léger, Member of the Institute,[4] who for\r\nfifty-one years past, has devoted special study to all the peoples of\r\nAustria-Hungary and knows them thoroughly. Further, M. Ernest Denis,\r\nprofessor at the Sorbonne, has written a remarkable history of Bohemia.\r\nIn studying on the spot for the purpose of writing this book, he has\r\nacquired a very full knowledge of the Czech nation, which by its\r\ngeographical position in Bohemia and Moravia, forms the indispensable\r\nbasis of every reconstitution of Austria-Hungary in a modern form.\r\nFinally, may I be allowed to cite myself, since for twenty-two years,\r\nby a series of manifold inquiries on the spot, I have endeavoured to\r\nunderstand in their detail the very complex problems which form the\r\nAustro-Hungarian question?\r\n\r\nNow, I have reason to believe that these men, who have thoroughly studied\r\nAustria-Hungary, and whom therefore we ought to trust, are agreed on the\r\ngeneral lines of the policy which the Allies should pursue in regard to\r\nthe Hapsburg monarchy. I think that I am not mistaken when I say that the\r\nopinions which I am about to express are on the whole in harmony with the\r\nviews of these gentlemen.\r\n\r\nLet us first understand that those who still uphold the doctrine of\r\nthe maintenance of Austria-Hungary as she is, that is, in subjection\r\nto the Hapsburg dynasty, are at least twenty years behind their time.\r\nTo adopt this solution would be to play the German game; for it is\r\npractically impossible to separate the Hapsburgs from the Hohenzollerns.\r\nIt would establish the Germanic yoke on the Slav and Latin subjects of\r\nthe Hapsburgs, thus facilitating the accomplishment of the scheme “from\r\nHamburg to the Persian Gulf.”\r\n\r\nFinally, the Hapsburg dynasty has given too many proofs of its\r\nincapacity, its duplicity, and its submissiveness to the suggestions of\r\nBerlin, to allow us to consider seriously its maintenance at the head of\r\nthe Austro-Hungarian peoples.\r\n\r\nIn no way must the Allies be dupes of the comedy which the Pangermans of\r\nBerlin, Vienna, and Budapest are getting up now in order to profit by the\r\nignorance of the Allies as to Austro-Hungarian facts.\r\n\r\nAll the measures tending to force Austria-Hungary into the German\r\n_Zollverein_, which would make its political absorption inevitable, must\r\nbe looked upon as a farce, a simple act of criminal violence done to\r\nthe wishes of the immense majority of the populations in the Hapsburg\r\nmonarchy. So true is this, that certain Magyar noblemen, who up to the\r\npresent have been decided allies of Berlin, are already uttering protests\r\nagainst the Prussian yoke, understanding at last that it is to be imposed\r\nupon them. Count Theodore Batthyany, vice-president of the Independent\r\nLeft of the Hungarian Chamber, declared at the end of March, 1916: “It\r\nis often said among us that the future Customs-Union would create in our\r\ncountry better economical conditions. This is much more true for Germany,\r\nwho will hold both the reins and the whip in the combination.... Besides\r\nthe Germans make no secret of it that in the proposed compact there will\r\nbe other agricultural states which will be our future competitors (in\r\nallusion to Turkey and the Balkan States). Certainly, from the time that\r\nthe union is concluded, all capital will come to us from Germany and\r\nnever from elsewhere. The Germans will have the monopoly of capital among\r\nus, and you know what a monopoly is and what it costs. The money will\r\ncost us dear” (_Le Temps_, 1st February, 1916).\r\n\r\nIn Austria, M. Nemetz, President of the Chamber of Commerce at Prague,\r\ndeclared: “None of the arguments adduced in favour of a Customs-Union\r\nwith Germany will for a moment bear the light of criticism. An\r\ninsuperable obstacle is opposed to an intimate Customs-Union between\r\nthe two empires: their interests are not identical but on the contrary\r\ncompetitive” (quoted by _Le Temps_, 9th February, 1916).\r\n\r\nThese categorical declarations prove what resistance the Pangerman\r\nmanœuvre has already to encounter. The Allies have much to gain from\r\nthese statements, for they prove the reality of the deep opposition\r\nexisting between the interests of Pangerman Germany and those of the\r\nmajority of the Austro-Hungarian peoples.\r\n\r\nBut there remains an essential point to prove, for it gives rise to\r\nspecial anxiety in the minds of that part of the public in the Allied\r\ncountries which still harps on the false idea that Austro-Hungary is a\r\nspecially German country. This section of the public doubts whether the\r\napplication of the principle of nationalities, which the Allies demand,\r\nwould not have the effect of necessarily and considerably increasing\r\nGermany by incorporating in it the Germans of the Hapsburg empire.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, necessary to demonstrate by means of figures and\r\naccurate geographical and ethnographical arguments that this fear is\r\nquite chimerical. Austria-Hungary contains all the elements of a new\r\nState which can be constituted on just and lasting foundations, and under\r\nsuch conditions that it would form for the future an insurmountable\r\nbarrier to Pangermanism. It is there, as we shall see, on the road from\r\nHamburg to the Persian Gulf, in Central Europe, and nowhere else that we\r\nshall find the solution of the problem set to the world by the hateful\r\nambition of the Hohenzollerns.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nLet us examine in figures what would be the result in Central Europe of\r\nthe application of the principle of nationalities, which ought to form\r\nthe moral base of the Allies for the reconstitution of future Europe.\r\nThe French Socialist Congress at the end of 1915, in my opinion, gave\r\nan excellent definition of the principle of nationalities as we see it\r\nat work in the present war. The manifesto of the Congress declared:\r\n“No durable peace unless the small martyrized nations are restored to\r\ntheir political and economic independence.... No durable peace unless\r\nthe oppressed populations of Europe have restored to them the liberty of\r\nshaping their own destinies” (_L’Humanité_, 30th December, 1915).\r\n\r\nAs nothing in this world is absolute, it is clear that the principle of\r\nnationalities cannot always receive in practice a complete application.\r\nIn order to constitute States with a potentiality of life, we must\r\ntake into account not only the nationalities but also the strategical,\r\ndefensive, historical, and economical needs of the majority. There\r\nare besides countries like Macedonia and like certain regions of\r\nAustria-Hungary, where the nationalities are so intermingled that the\r\napplication of the principle of nationality can only be relative.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, sacrifices must sometimes be made at the cost of\r\nthe principle of nationalities for the sake of the general European\r\ninterest. Thus, for example, France cannot think of incorporating those\r\nwho speak French in Belgium and Switzerland. The first of those people\r\nwish to remain Belgians and the second wish to remain Swiss. Their wish\r\nmust be all the more respected since the maintenance of the Belgian\r\nstate and of the Swiss state is necessary to the balance and the peace\r\nof Europe. There are, moreover, other parts of the continent where this\r\nconsideration outweighs the principle of nationalities.\r\n\r\nHaving given these explanations and made these reservations, let us see\r\nwhat would be obtained in the main by the application of the principle\r\nof nationalities to the German empire. In virtue of this principle the\r\nGermans ought to restore liberty to those peoples who are included by\r\nforce within their boundaries, that is to say about\r\n\r\n                                            Inhabitants.\r\n    Poles                                    5,000,000\r\n    Inhabitants of Alsace and Lorraine       1,500,000\r\n    Danes                                      200,000\r\n                                             ---------\r\n        Total                                6,700,000\r\n\r\nThe Germany of to-day, which numbered 68 millions of inhabitants in 1914,\r\nincluding the non-Germans, would be brought down to about 61,300,000, in\r\nround figures, 61,000,000 of genuine Germans.\r\n\r\nBut the logical application of the principle of nationalities would give\r\nto that Germany the liberty of absorbing those Germans of the Hapsburg\r\nmonarchy who on historical, strategical, and geographical grounds can be\r\nlegitimately added to Germany after its reduction from 68 to 61 millions\r\nof inhabitants. What would be the result?\r\n\r\nLet us look back to p. 32 and examine the map which sums up the\r\nethnographical situation of Austria-Hungary. On this map the Slav and\r\nLatin nationalities subject to the Hapsburgs, named in the margin,\r\nare indicated by different shadings. The region inhabited by Germans\r\nand that inhabited by the Magyars have been left blank. The two last\r\nethnographic groups are separated by a dotted line. This map only gives\r\na very imperfect idea of the ethnographic facts, because it is drawn\r\nfrom ethnographic documents which are German and Magyar, and which are\r\npurposely falsified. In reality the Slav regions are a good deal more\r\nextensive than is indicated by the blank zones (Germans and Magyars).\r\nThis is particularly true in the blank zone to the north and north-west\r\nof the purely Czech region.\r\n\r\nVienna, which, however, is in the centre of a perfectly blank zone, is by\r\nno means, as is generally believed, a purely German city. Her population\r\nis Slav to the amount of about one-third (Poles and especially Czechs).\r\nThis fact, which is certain, is yet not recognized by any official\r\nAustrian statistics, because these are drawn up by German functionaries\r\nwho have orders to falsify them. Their principal mode of garbling the\r\nfigures is as follows:\r\n\r\nIn the whole of Austria every Slav or Latin, who merely knows a few words\r\nof German, is styled, much against his own will, a German. Now, all the\r\nSlavs who live in Vienna know a few words of German. This allows the\r\nGerman statisticians of the Austrian Government to conclude that there\r\nare no Slavs in Vienna, and to set down the number of the Slavs in all\r\nthe rest of Austria at a figure considerably below the truth.\r\n\r\nIn Hungary the statistics are garbled with the same effrontery by the\r\nfunctionaries of the Budapest government in favour of the Magyar element.\r\n\r\nThe following, however, are the results given for the whole of the\r\nHapsburg monarchy by the official Germano-Magyar statistics in the census\r\nof 1910:\r\n\r\n                                           Round figures in tens\r\n                    _Austria._                 of thousands.\r\n\r\n    Germans                                      9,950,000\r\n    Czechs                                       6,440,000\r\n    Poles                                        4,970,000\r\n    Ruthenians                                   3,520,000\r\n    Slovenes                                     1,260,000\r\n    Serbo-Croatians                                790,000\r\n    Italians                                       770,000\r\n    Roumanians                                     280,000\r\n                                                ----------\r\n        Total                                   27,980,000\r\n\r\n                     _Hungary._\r\n\r\n    Magyars                                     10,050,000\r\n    Roumanians                                   2,950,000\r\n    Serbo-Croatians                              2,940,000\r\n    Germans                                      2,040,000\r\n    Slovaks                                      1,970,000\r\n    Ruthenians                                     480,000\r\n                                                ----------\r\n        Total                                   20,430,000\r\n\r\n                  _Bosnia and Herzegovina._\r\n\r\n    Serbo-Croatians (orthodox, or Moslems\r\n      of Serbian origin)                         2,000,000\r\n\r\nAccording to these figures there are 12 millions of Germans in the\r\nHapsburg empire, but we shall see that not nearly all these 12 millions\r\nof Germans could be united to Germany. In fact:\r\n\r\n1. As the table shows, rather more than two millions of Germans are\r\nin Hungary, where they are scattered in small groups among the other\r\nnationalities. They could not therefore be united to Germany.\r\n\r\n2. Out of the 10 millions, roughly speaking, of Germans in Austria,\r\nthose of Bohemia, to the north and north-west of the purely Czech zone,\r\ncould not be united to Germany, because in that zone they are mixed up\r\nwith numerous Czechs, and because the dotted line, which on the map (p.\r\n68) separates Bohemia from the German empire of to-day, represents the\r\nhistorical and strategical boundaries of the kingdom of Bohemia. Now it\r\nwould be impossible without these boundaries to assure the independence\r\nof the Czecho-Slovaks. Clearly we could not think of sacrificing nearly 9\r\nmillions of Czecho-Slovaks to 1 million of Germans in Bohemia, especially\r\nas these same Germans simply squatted in the country long ago by sheer\r\nviolence and fraud.\r\n\r\n3. By this fact the 10 millions of Germans, who might seem to be eligible\r\nfor incorporation in Germany, are reduced to about 9 millions. These\r\nform on the map the blank group which stretches from Switzerland to the\r\ndotted line which marks the Magyar ethnographical boundary. But there\r\nare serious reasons for thinking that were a thorough investigation made\r\nof the ethnographical facts, that is to say, of the mixture of Slavs\r\nand Germans to the east of this group, and consequently between the\r\npurely Czech group to the north of Vienna and the purely Slovene group\r\nto the south of Vienna, the result of such an investigation would be\r\nto show that this German group could not in its entirety be united to\r\nGermany. As it would be out of the question here to enter into these very\r\ndifficult ethnographical details, we shall, under all possible reserve,\r\nand purely for the convenience of demonstration, make the supposition\r\nthat the whole of this German group should be united to Germany. But from\r\nthese 9 millions of Germans we should certainly still have to subtract\r\nthe Slavs who are included in this figure through the systematic garbling\r\nof the Austrian statistics. The typical example of the city of Vienna,\r\ncited above, proves this necessity. As this deception is practised on an\r\nenormous scale at the expense of the Slavs, we may allow that the true\r\nnumber of Germans in this part of Austria who could be geographically\r\nincorporated in Germany, amounts to not more than 7 or 8 millions. Let us\r\ntake this last figure. If these 8 millions of Germans were incorporated\r\nin Germany, then Germany of to-day, reduced for the reasons indicated on\r\np. 123 to 61 millions, would be enlarged, at the expense of Austria, by\r\n8 millions of inhabitants. She would then have a total of 69 millions of\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\nTherefore, as the present German empire had in 1914 a population of 68\r\nmillions of inhabitants, we see that the application of the principle of\r\nnationalities would allow Germany to gain on the south-west just about\r\nthe equivalent of what the same principle would take from her on the\r\ncircumference of the existing empire.\r\n\r\nWould a Germany of 69 or 70 millions of genuine Germans be really\r\ndangerous for Europe? I do not think so, for, as we shall see, the\r\napplication of the principle of nationalities would have the effect of\r\nwithdrawing totally from the influence of Berlin’s Pangermanism all the\r\nrest of the inhabitants of Austria-Hungary.\r\n\r\nIn fact, if out of the 50 millions of inhabitants in Austria-Hungary of\r\nto-day about 8 millions joined Germany, 42 millions of Austro-Hungarian\r\nsubjects would remain. Of this number:\r\n\r\nFive millions of Poles would join Poland;\r\n\r\nFour millions of Ruthenians would join Russia;\r\n\r\nThree millions of Roumanians would join Roumania;\r\n\r\nOne million of Italians would join Italy;\r\n\r\nMaking a total of 13 millions of inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThere would therefore remain a compact group composed of 29 millions of\r\ninhabitants, made up of Czech-Slovaks, Magyars, and Germans, these last\r\ndiluted in the solid mass of Magyars and Serbo-Croatians. As the Magyars\r\nand Serbo-Croatians wish to unite with the 5 million Serbians of Serbia,\r\nwe thus deduce the presence in Central Europe of a mass of 34 million\r\ninhabitants, containing an infinitesimal proportion of Germans and so\r\nsituated geographically that they could perfectly form United States, in\r\nwhich the rights of each nationality and the form of government of each\r\nState would be respected, and which, nevertheless, would constitute an\r\neconomic territory extensive enough to correspond to modern needs.\r\n\r\nThe obstacle to the creation of such United States might seem to be the\r\nreluctance of the Magyars, who at present play the German game, to come\r\nto an understanding with the neighbouring nationalities. This objection\r\ndisappears when we know what is unfortunately known to none but a small\r\nnumber of experts. Out of the 10 millions of Magyars, there are about 9\r\nmillions of poor labourers, almost all agricultural, cynically exploited\r\nby the Magyar nobility, who possess nearly all the land. Now it is\r\nthese nobles, owners of enormous landed estates, who, with the Magyar\r\nfunctionaries whom they nominate, are Prussophile, and not even all of\r\nthem are that. It must also be known that the 9 millions of Magyar\r\nproletariat are not so much as represented in the parliament at Budapest,\r\nfor elections in Hungary are neither more nor less than barefaced\r\nswindles practised for the benefit of the million Magyars who sweat their\r\npoor compatriots. Now these 9 millions of unhappy peasants by no means\r\nlove the Prussians. More than that, they are quite ready to fraternize\r\nwith the other democratic masses represented by the nationalities which\r\nsurround them. Therefore, on the day when the true Magyar people shall\r\nbe delivered from the feudal nobility who oppress them, and shall become\r\nin their turn masters of their own destinies, they will certainly not\r\nstand out against the creation of the United States here adumbrated. I am\r\nquite sure of the popular feeling on this subject, for on my last visits\r\nto Budapest I was able to put myself in communication with the leaders\r\nof the Magyar democratic organizations. It was thus that I learned that\r\neven before the war they had been trying to find a basis for a mutual\r\nunderstanding with the other Slav nationalities of Hungary. So strong\r\nindeed was this tendency that it furnished the nefarious Count Tisza with\r\na motive for declaring war in order to elude the democratic movement,\r\nwhich threatened the privileges of the Magyar nobility, of which he is\r\none of the leaders.\r\n\r\nIn short, we may conclude that there is in Austria-Hungary and in Serbia\r\na mass of 34 millions of inhabitants, who are practically free from\r\nGermanic elements and could form in Central Europe a confederacy of\r\nUnited States that might in time develop into the United States of Europe.\r\n\r\nThus there undoubtedly exist all the ethnographical elements which\r\ncould render possible the erection in Central Europe of a very powerful\r\ntriple barrier against every aggressive revival of Pangermanism (see p.\r\n43). The erection of this barrier would form the solution of the great\r\nproblem set us by the Pangerman peril. It would free for ever numerous\r\nnationalities from the Prussian yoke. It would coincide not only with the\r\ninterests of all the Allies, but also with those of the whole world. For\r\nas I hope to prove in Chapter IX, the inhabitants of both South and North\r\nAmerica would be not less vitally affected than the European Allies and\r\nJapan by the achievement of the scheme “from Hamburg to the Persian Gulf.”\r\n\r\nTherefore, the necessary but sufficient backbone of the Pangerman plan,\r\nas represented by the formula “Hamburg to the Persian Gulf,” can be\r\ncertainly destroyed in Central Europe and there only. The net result\r\nis that the question of Austria-Hungary constitutes the crucial point\r\nof a problem which is not only European but universal, set to all the\r\ncivilized States by the war which Prussianized Germany has initiated and\r\nby the execrable ambition of the Hohenzollerns.\r\n\r\nThe question of Austria-Hungary has besides an aspect of social and\r\nuniversal interest, which the Liberals and Socialists of Allied or\r\nneutral countries have not yet perhaps sufficiently contemplated.\r\nThe supremacy of Germany over Austria-Hungary would have, in fact, a\r\nsocial consequence of infinite importance: a new lease of crushing and\r\nstrengthened power would be ensured to the German-Austrian aristocracy,\r\nto the Magyar aristocracy of Hungary, to the German aristocracy of the\r\nGerman empire, and above all to the execrable Prussian _Junkers_, who are\r\nprincipally responsible for the war. This great and insolent triumph of\r\nthe _Junker_ spirit, supported by the means of universal domination which\r\nwould be put at the disposal of the Berlin government as a consequence\r\nof the accomplishment of the scheme “from Hamburg to the Persian Gulf,”\r\nwould have a disastrous after-effect by repressing those democratic\r\nand liberal movements, which are at present developing legitimately and\r\nnecessarily, not only in the Allied countries but in the whole world.\r\nFinally, it would entail fresh revolutionary crises, causing disturbances\r\nwhich it is of serious interest to avoid, lest ideas of social justice\r\nshould lose the vantage ground of liberty which they have so painfully\r\nconquered.\r\n\r\nThese considerations, therefore, lead us to the conclusion that the final\r\nliberation of all the Latin and Slav peoples of Austria-Hungary from\r\nthe German yoke is a matter of universal social interest. In fact, it\r\nconstitutes an essential condition of the progress of liberal ideas, of\r\nthe pacific development and organization of democracy in the whole world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE BALKANS AND THE PANGERMAN PLAN.\r\n\r\n    I. The connexion between the Pangerman plan and the plan of\r\n    Bulgarian supremacy.\r\n\r\n    II. Greece and the Pangerman ambitions.\r\n\r\n    III. Roumania and the Pangerman plan.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn virtue of the geographical position which they occupy in the zone\r\n“from Hamburg to the Persian Gulf,” the Balkan States are of extreme\r\nimportance for the making or the marring of the whole Pangerman plan.\r\nMoreover, events have proved to the satisfaction of the most sceptical\r\nthe influence which these States exert on the issue of the struggle.\r\nPublic opinion, therefore, both in Allied and neutral countries, should\r\nnote very clearly the intimate relation which exists between the Balkan\r\nfactors and the universal Pangerman plan.\r\n\r\nI can here touch only on the fundamental Balkan factors, those that\r\nhave a durable and permanent character, not on the attitude of certain\r\ngovernments in the Eastern peninsula. That attitude for the last year\r\nhas been singularly vacillating. It shifts, in fact, under the action\r\nof those parasitic German influences which, through the dynastic\r\nties of the reigning families, backed by the threats of Berlin, sway\r\nthese governments in opposition to the national interests which it is\r\ntheir bounden duty to defend. Moreover, simple justice compels us to\r\nacknowledge, that the diplomatic mistakes made by the Allies, especially\r\nin 1915, in consequence of their imperfect acquaintance with Balkan\r\nfacts, has been singularly favourable to the success of the German\r\ninfluences.\r\n\r\nThus, for example, at Athens, the present Cabinet, formed after the\r\narbitrary dissolution of the Greek parliament, and therefore destitute of\r\nall constitutional authority, has been instigated by King Constantine,\r\nbrother-in-law of the Emperor William II., to persevere in a policy\r\nwhich all influential Greeks who are free to speak their minds regard as\r\ndisastrous to the true interests of Hellenism. Similarly at Bukarest the\r\nattitude of the Bratiano cabinet is subjected by eminent Roumanians to\r\nsearching criticism. Thus _La Roumanie_, the organ of M. Take Jonescu,\r\nspeaking of the commercial agreement between Germany and Roumania, has\r\nrecently said: “This agreement makes Roumania the dupe of Germany”[5]\r\n(see _Le Journal_, 20th April, 1916). The final decision of certain\r\nBalkan governments is, therefore, for the moment still in suspense, but\r\nwhatever it may be, each of the Balkan peoples would infallibly see its\r\nfuture interests thwarted or menaced by the triumph of the Pangerman\r\nplan. It is important to clear up these prospects. So far as Montenegro\r\nand Serbia are concerned, any discussion would be superfluous, so evident\r\nis it that a German victory would mean for these two States their\r\ndefinite and final disappearance.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nIt is otherwise with Bulgaria. Indeed, the key of the whole Balkan\r\nsituation lies in the plan of a Bulgarian supremacy, which, as we shall\r\nsee, is closely bound up, at least in principle, with the Pangerman plan.\r\n\r\nIt was said long ago that the Bulgarians are the Prussians of the East.\r\nNow it is just their fixed idea of achieving at any cost their dream of\r\ndominating the Balkans which has led the Bulgarians to throw in their\r\nlot with Berlin, without perceiving that, though they might benefit by\r\nthe first phase of this combination, they would finally fall victims to\r\nPangermanism.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GREAT BULGARIA.]\r\n\r\nThe pretensions of Bulgaria to supremacy, though even less has been known\r\nabout them than about the Pangerman plan, are nevertheless relatively\r\nold, as is conclusively proved by the following facts:\r\n\r\nThe map printed above is a document of the highest importance, for it\r\nenables us to detect the real policy, first of Bulgaria, and next of the\r\nother Balkan States. This map is an exact translation and reproduction of\r\nthe map which is to be found on p. 56 of the historical part of a book\r\npublished in Bulgarian at Sofia and called: _The Soldier’s Companion_,\r\n_Manual for the Soldiers of all arms_. This is an official work of\r\npropaganda in the army, and therefore in the whole Bulgarian people,\r\nsince all Bulgarians go through the ranks; and it was published in\r\nobedience to order No. 76 of March 14th, 1907, issued by the Bulgarian\r\nMinistry of War, approved and authorized by the Chief of the Headquarters\r\nStaff of the Bulgarian army. This manual has been recommended by the\r\nBulgarian Ministry of War, in circular No. 28 of March 21st, 1907. Hence\r\nwe are confronted with an official Bulgarian book dating from 1907, which\r\nproves very clearly beyond the possibility of dispute the ideas which\r\nhave been systematically instilled into the whole Bulgarian people for at\r\nleast nine years.\r\n\r\nIn this map, entitled Great Bulgaria, which is coloured in the eighth\r\nedition of the Bulgarian original, the part said to be “already set free\r\nby the Bulgarians” is coloured pink (represented by large hatchings on\r\nour map), and the parts said to be “not set free by the Bulgarians” are\r\ncoloured red (represented by closer hatchings on our map). This official\r\nBulgarian document helps us to understand, both what happened in the\r\nBalkan wars, and the conduct of the government of Sofia during the\r\nEuropean war.\r\n\r\nIn fact, when in 1912 the Bulgarians entered into an alliance with the\r\nGreeks and Serbians against Turkey, they were not even then true to\r\ntheir Allies. At that time they had a very low opinion of the Greeks and\r\nSerbians as soldiers. But they thought it very expedient to employ the\r\nforces of these nations against the principal enemy, Turkey, intending\r\nafterwards to settle accounts with their temporary allies by means of the\r\nincrease of power which they expected to gain at the expense of Turkey.\r\nAs these intentions were suspected at Belgrade and Athens, it may easily\r\nbe conceived that from the very beginning of their joint action the\r\nGreek and Serbian governments did not repose full confidence in that of\r\nSofia. The distrust of the Greeks and Serbians was, moreover, thoroughly\r\naroused when King Ferdinand, before he allowed his troops to hurl\r\nthemselves against the lines of Chataldja, disclosed his claim to enter\r\nConstantinople, with the evident intention of staying there if he could.\r\n\r\nGiven the Bulgarian claims in the west, which are set forth in our map,\r\nwe can further explain why in 1913 the Bulgarians, whose character is\r\nhard and unyielding, refused all compromise when the Serbians, excluded\r\nby Europe from the Adriatic, demanded from the Bulgarians an equitable\r\ncompensation to the south of Uskub.\r\n\r\nMoreover, always instigated by their desire of supremacy, and stirred up\r\nby Vienna and Berlin, the Bulgarians thought that the moment had come\r\nto annihilate the Serbians and Greeks. So they made the sudden attack\r\nof June 17-30, 1913, on their former allies. But the wary Serbians and\r\nGreeks were ready for the encounter. Roumania, as little inclined to\r\ntolerate Bulgarian supremacy as Greece or Serbia, marched her troops\r\nto within ten kilometres of Sofia. The Bulgarians were crushed by the\r\nSerbians at Bregalnitza, and were compelled to sign, on August 10th,\r\n1913, the treaty of Bukarest. But from that moment, animated by a\r\nboundless hatred of their conquerors, they had but one desire, and that\r\nwas to take vengeance on the victors, one after the other, and above all\r\nto destroy the treaty of Bukarest at the first favourable opportunity.\r\n\r\nHence\r\n\r\n1º. The treaties made by Sofia with Berlin and Constantinople, before\r\nApril, 1914, as M. Radoslavoff has disclosed (see _Havas_, quoted by _Le\r\nPetit Parisien_, 26th March, 1916, and _Le Temps_, 10th April, 1916).\r\n\r\n2º. Bulgaria’s participation in the European war on the side of Germany,\r\nwhose plans for the future, like the Bulgarian ambitions, were threatened\r\nby the consequence of the treaty of Bukarest (_see_ Chapter II, § 1).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn examination of the Bulgarian map, which serves us as a document,\r\nproves that the Bulgarian pretentions to supremacy, like those of\r\nPangermanism, aim at absorbing, regardless of language or race, the\r\nregions whose possession is deemed useful to Bulgaria. Thus the rapacious\r\ndoctrine of the Bulgarians is absolutely identical with that of the\r\nPrussians. This identity has facilitated the understanding between the\r\ntwo peoples. In fact, the Great Bulgaria of our official document of 1907\r\n(see the map on p. 133) includes the following: the Roumanian Dobrudja\r\nas far as Galatz and Sulina, on which clearly the Bulgarians can lay no\r\njustifiable claim; the shores of the Ægean Sea; the territory from Serres\r\nto Gumuldjina, where the Greek element is dominant; the region of Nisch,\r\nwhich is Serbian; the region of Prizrend, which had been recognized as\r\nSerbian by the Bulgarians themselves in their treaty of alliance with the\r\nSerbians in 1912. As to the region of Uskub as far as Lake Ochrida, near\r\nAlbania, the Bulgarians in their treaty with the Serbians admitted it to\r\nbe disputable. Its allotment was to be referred to the arbitration of\r\nthe Emperor of Russia, which the Bulgarians never seriously desired, and\r\nto which they opposed a solid obstacle by their attack on the Serbians\r\nin June, 1913. Lastly, the region south of Uskub, that is, the portion\r\nof Macedonia which forms the south of the present Serbia, requires a\r\ndetailed exposition by itself. This is essential, for concerning Serbian\r\nMacedonia many misconceptions have been propagated by the Allied Press\r\nand have been the source of the mistakes committed by the Allies in the\r\nBalkans in 1915. It is therefore absolutely necessary to correct these\r\nmisconceptions, if the Allies would avoid falling into fresh mistakes in\r\nthe Balkans, for which they would again have to pay a heavy price.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SERBIAN MACEDONIA.]\r\n\r\nIn short, to look the difficulties clearly in the face, we must answer\r\nthe question, Is the south of Serbia Bulgarian? (see the map, above).\r\n\r\nThe territory in the south of Serbia on which divergent opinions have\r\nbeen expressed is represented with tolerable exactness:\r\n\r\n1º. By a triangle of which the apex lies a little to the north of Veles,\r\nand of which the other angles are formed by Guevgheli on the east and\r\nLake Ochrida on the west.\r\n\r\n2º. By a strip of territory which lies to the east of this triangle, and\r\nwhich, between the left bank of the Vardar and Bulgaria, contains the\r\nregions of Kotchana, Stip, and Stroutmitza-gare. The Bulgarians contend\r\nthat all the territory formed by this triangle and this lateral strip is\r\nincontestably Bulgarian; last year some Allied writers supported this\r\ncontention. In the first place, it was said, the treaty of San Stefano\r\n(1878) assigned to Bulgaria what is now the south of Serbia. They forgot\r\nthat in 1878 the ethnographic study of the Ottoman empire had not yet\r\nbegun, and that at that time the Russians and the English were both\r\ninclined, for different reasons, to consider almost all the inhabitants\r\nof European Turkey as Bulgarians, without inquiry or distinction. The\r\nRussians, who then aimed at establishing themselves ultimately in the\r\nBalkans, were impelled by this aim to regard the Bulgarians as extremely\r\nnumerous. As for the English, burning with indignation at the “Bulgarian\r\natrocities” of Gladstone, they very generously thought of nothing but\r\nliberating from the Turkish yoke as many Christians as possible, and\r\nthese in Macedonia were labelled indiscriminately Bulgarians.\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, it was only after the treaty of San Stefano that the\r\nethnographical study of Macedonia was taken up in earnest. Moreover,\r\nit is proper to add that most of the writers who have discussed the\r\nsubject have drawn their information, not from inquiries on the spot,\r\nbut from Belgrade, Athens and Sofia. In these three centres they\r\nwere supplied with minute statistics, very well printed, and to all\r\nappearance perfectly convincing, but which laboured under the serious\r\ndisadvantage that they flatly contradicted each other. For my own part,\r\nI acknowledged that I was not able to arrive at a comparatively clear\r\nidea of the complicated ethnography of this part of Macedonia till I had\r\ncarried out my inquiries of 1914, not as before in the Balkan capitals,\r\nbut on the spot, at Uskub, at Prizrend, at Prichtina, at Monastir, at\r\nOchrida, and at Strouga.\r\n\r\nThis inquiry, conducted six months before the war, led me to the\r\nfollowing conclusions. Serbian Macedonia contains two quite distinct\r\ngroups of population.\r\n\r\n1º. The one is formed of Turks, Albanians, Kutzo-Wallachians or\r\nRoumanians, Greeks, Jews, and Gipsies, who are scattered all over the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n2º. The second group is composed of the Macedonian Slavs.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of trustworthy statistics it is impossible to say which of\r\nthese two groups is numerically the stronger. Thus, at Uskub, the Turks\r\nand the Jews alone were reckoned as numerous as the exarchists, that is\r\nto say, as those who, attending the churches and schools of the Bulgarian\r\nexarchate, were considered to be Bulgarians.\r\n\r\nBut what is quite certain is that the Serbs and the Bulgarians are found\r\nin the second group of the population, that of the Macedonian Slavs.\r\nNow this group itself comprises four sections, namely, native Serbs,\r\nnative Bulgarians, “floating” Serbs, and “floating” Bulgarians. The\r\ntwo “floating” sections seem to be more numerous than the two native\r\nsections. This singular expression, “floating,” is justified by the\r\nfollowing explanation. In 1870 the Bulgarians of Macedonia, then Ottoman\r\nsubjects, obtained from the Sultan leave to be considered, from the\r\nreligious point of view, not as before members of the Greek Orthodox\r\nChurch, but as members of a separate and autonomous church, the Bulgarian\r\nExarchate, of which the seat was fixed at Constantinople. The Bulgarians\r\nof Bulgaria, who also joined the new church, took advantage of the\r\ncondition of things which resulted from this creation to organize in\r\nMacedonia a propaganda nominally religious but really political, being\r\ndesigned to gain over to the Bulgarian nation as many Macedonian Slavs\r\nas possible; and this propaganda was directed and actively assisted by\r\nthe Bulgarian Exarch, Mgr. Joseph, who resided in Constantinople and was\r\nan Ottoman subject. In those days the Macedonian Slavs were very poor\r\npeasants, who had been oppressed by the Turks for centuries, and the\r\ngreater number of them did not care a straw whether they belonged to one\r\nnationality or to another. The propaganda of the Bulgarian Exarchate in\r\nMacedonia came into conflict with the Greek propaganda, and a little\r\nlater with the Serbian propaganda, which two propagandas, the one\r\ndirected from Athens and the other from Belgrade, had one and the same\r\nobject. All three propagandas together employed in Macedonia the most\r\ndiverse means—money, schools, and terrorism—to win over the Macedonian\r\nSlavs, who were still hesitating, to the national Bulgarian cause, to the\r\nnational Greek cause, and to the national Serbian cause.\r\n\r\nThese various propagandas very often led to extraordinary results, which\r\nproved, the artificial character of the movements. For example, before\r\nthe European war you might find in many Macedonian villages families of\r\nthree blood brothers, of whom one would say he was a Greek, the second\r\nwould solemnly affirm that he was a Serb, and the third would swear\r\nhe was a Bulgarian. Frequently, under the influence of the forcible\r\narguments applied to them, their national convictions would undergo a\r\nsudden and radical change, so that the man who yesterday was a Serb,\r\nto-day would give himself out as a Bulgarian, or contrariwise. It is\r\nto persons whose nationality is of this unstable and erratic character\r\nthat the adjective “floating” is appropriately applied. At the same\r\ntime there is no question that the Serbian propaganda, having started\r\nbusiness in Macedonia about fifteen years later than its Bulgarian\r\nrival, had gathered into the fold fewer of those “floating” sheep,\r\nwho were still sitting on the nationalist fence, not yet having made\r\nup their minds whether to come down on the Serbian or the Macedonian\r\nside. The two elements which compose the Bulgarian group in Macedonia,\r\nnamely, the genuine Bulgarians and the “floating” Bulgarians, have,\r\nbesides, a geographical distribution which is comparatively definite.\r\nThough mixed up with Turkish elements, the inhabitants of the region of\r\nKotchana and Istip (Stip in Serbian), on the right bank of the Vardar\r\nand on the Bulgarian boundary (see the map on p. 137) are for the most\r\npart indisputably genuine Bulgarians. If at the time of the treaty of\r\nBukarest the Serbians claimed these mountainous regions, they did so\r\nfor strategical reasons, in order to ensure the defence of the railway,\r\nwhich, passing through the valley of the Vardar, connects Belgrade,\r\nNisch, and Uskub with Salonika, and is therefore of vital importance\r\nfor Serbia. The present war has proved that this point of view was not\r\nwithout justification.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, on the right bank of the Vardar, and therefore in\r\nthe greater part of Serbian Macedonia, the Bulgarian elements, whether\r\ngenuine or “floating,” are more or less scattered among all the other\r\nracial elements. Undoubtedly there are to the west of the Vardar some\r\nBulgarians whose descent is very ancient and beyond dispute. A certain\r\nnumber, who have emigrated from these regions, exercise a predominant\r\npolitical influence even in Bulgaria. Thus General Boyadjeff was born at\r\nOchrida, and M. Genadieff was born at Monastir. But these Bulgarians by\r\ndescent are certainly a minority in the whole population of Macedonia.\r\nFor example, at Monastir, in 1914, out of 60,000 inhabitants about a\r\nthird were Bulgarians. It is true that round about Monastir and Uskub you\r\nmight find villages inhabited almost entirely by Bulgarians, but beside\r\nthese villages were others formed of different Macedonian nationalities\r\n(Serbs, Roumanians, etc.).\r\n\r\nAs for the “floating” Bulgarians, after a Serbian occupation which had\r\nlasted only five months since the treaty of Bukarest, many of them\r\nalready proclaimed themselves Serbs. For example, the Serbian mayor of\r\nthe little town of Strouga had been in Turkish times the pillar of the\r\nBulgarian propaganda in the district of Strouga. Similar cases were\r\nvery numerous. The Bulgarians of Sofia, unable to deny this wholesale\r\ntransformation into Serbians of quondam Bulgarians who had been raked\r\ninto the fold by the propaganda of the Exarchate, gave out that this\r\nsudden conversion was the effect of that reign of terror which, according\r\nto them, the Serbians resorted to for the purpose of establishing\r\ntheir dominion in Macedonia. The allegation seems to me untenable. I\r\ntraversed most of the roads of Serbian Macedonia in the winter (January,\r\n1914), accompanied only by one or two persons. I very often met Serbian\r\nsoldiers, who came from the garrisons on the Albanian frontier and were\r\ngoing on furlough to Northern Serbia. Now these soldiers were travelling\r\nsingly or in groups of two or three. With nothing but a walking-stick\r\nin their hand they were making their way over the 60 or 70 kilometres\r\nwhich separated them from the nearest railway. If the country had really\r\nbeen inhabited by convinced Bulgarians who detested the Serbians, is it\r\nnot evident that there would have been attacks on these isolated and\r\ndefenceless Serbian soldiers? But there were no such attacks, and from\r\npersonal observation I can affirm that the most complete tranquillity\r\nprevailed in Serbian Macedonia, which in the days of the Turks had been\r\nthe scene of incessant murders; and these murders were generally brought\r\nabout by the terrorist means employed by the Bulgarian propaganda.\r\n\r\nWhat is certain is, that at the beginning of 1914 the “floating”\r\nBulgarians, who were in fact the more numerous, acquiesced without\r\nresistance in the Serbian rule and called themselves Serbians. The\r\nBulgarian Exarch, Mgr. Joseph, who had organized and directed the\r\nBulgarian propaganda since 1870, was not at all surprised at this result.\r\nHe acknowledged to me at Sofia, in February, 1914, that the Bulgarian\r\ngame was up in the south of Macedonia, and that in a short time most of\r\nthe adherents whom he had enlisted in former days would prove themselves\r\nvery good Serbians. Indeed, he had made up his mind to it, for he had\r\nbeen opposed to the attack of June, 1913, on the Serbians and the Greeks,\r\nand he thought that Bulgaria should accept a situation for which she\r\nherself was responsible, and of which she must bear the consequences.\r\n\r\nFor these manifold reasons it is impossible to say that the south\r\nof Macedonia is Bulgarian. But the Bulgarian people of Bulgaria has\r\nbeen completely intoxicated by the intense propaganda which has been\r\norganized, especially during the last thirty years, in Bulgaria itself\r\nby Bulgarians who are natives of Ottoman Macedonia. These men, most of\r\nthem very energetic, have in reality engrossed all the important posts,\r\nmilitary, political, and administrative, in Bulgaria. So well have they\r\ndone the business of propaganda that the lowest Bulgarian peasant of\r\nBulgaria believes in his heart and soul that all Serbian Macedonia is\r\nBulgarian. It is easy to understand how German policy at Sofia has been\r\nable to turn this state of mind to account for the purpose of hurrying\r\nthe Bulgarian people into the war on the side of Pangermanism.\r\n\r\nTo recapitulate, the south of Macedonia is really Macedonia, that is\r\nto say, it is a territory inhabited by motley peoples, who are almost\r\neverywhere jumbled up together. The Bulgarians who live there cannot\r\ntherefore rightfully claim that the treaty of Bukarest violated the\r\nprinciple of nationalities to their detriment by assigning South-Western\r\nMacedonia to Serbia. In fact, just because it is Macedonia, that is,\r\nan extraordinary jumble of heterogeneous peoples, the principle of\r\nnationalities cannot possibly be applied to Macedonia. In strict justice,\r\nthe destiny of this peculiar country should be settled simply and solely\r\nwith reference to the general strategical and economic needs of the\r\nsurrounding States. Now if there are Bulgarians in Macedonia there are\r\nalso Serbians, and neither strategically nor economically is the south of\r\nMacedonia necessary to Bulgaria. On the other hand, Serbia has a really\r\nvital interest, both economic and defensive, in maintaining a direct\r\ngeographical contact with Greece, in order to have by means of Salonika\r\nthat access to the Ægean Sea which is for her indispensable.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat proves, moreover, in ample measure that the exorbitant Bulgarian\r\npretensions are not founded on a racial basis is that at present the\r\nambitions of the government of Sofia considerably exceed even the extreme\r\nlimits of the map which serves us as a document (see p. 133). Indeed, not\r\nonly does Bulgaria desire to keep the region of Nisch, but she aims at\r\nexpanding as far as Hungary, which in her turn also wishes to encroach\r\non Serbia. In February, 1916, Mr. Take Jonescu declared at Bukarest that\r\nhe had it from a sure source that Germany had just promised to Bulgaria\r\nthe possession of Salonika and the Roumanian Dobrudja as far as Sulina\r\n(see _Le Matin_, 25th February, 1916), that is, exactly that part of the\r\nRoumanian Dobrudja which, according to our documentary map the Bulgarians\r\nhave coveted ever since 1907 at least. As to King Ferdinand, he wishes\r\nto obtain for his son the whole of central Albania, which would allow\r\nBulgaria under colour of an eventual arrangement, more or less forced on\r\na few Albanian tribes, to spread from the Black Sea to the Adriatic—an\r\nold plan familiar to all who are versed in the ambitions of the Coburg\r\nprince at Sofia. It is, moreover, probable, so far as Albania and the\r\nRoumanian Dobrudja are concerned, that the Berlin government will curb\r\nthe Bulgarian ambitions in order not to hurt the feelings of Vienna,\r\nand to prolong the neutrality of Roumania by nursing the illusions of\r\nthe Bratiano cabinet. There will be plenty of time afterwards to punish\r\nRoumania for hesitating to submit to the German yoke, when the hour for\r\nfreeing herself from it shall have passed for ever.\r\n\r\nThe secret treaty, the negotiations for which between the Kaiser and\r\nthe Tsar Ferdinand were revealed by _Le Temps_ of 29th February, 1916,\r\nwould ensure to Ferdinand the means of ultimately putting the last\r\ntouches to his plan of Bulgarian supremacy. But this treaty, linking\r\nthe fate of Bulgaria to that of Germany in a military, economic, and\r\npolitical aspect, would involve the inclusion of Bulgaria in the Germanic\r\nConfederation. Therefore, finally, always in pursuance of the plan of\r\n1911, Bulgaria would serve as a broad bridge between the Germanic\r\nConfederation of Central Europe and Prussianized Turkey.\r\n\r\nThis recent revelation completes the demonstration of the mode and form\r\nin which the plan of Bulgarian supremacy is closely bound up with the\r\nPangerman plan of world-wide domination.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nThe evidence of the facts as they now stand appears to be bringing the\r\nGreeks to recognize, that if the Allies have committed faults in the\r\nBalkans—through excess of candour, misconception of the mental factors,\r\nand with the best intentions in the world—the government of Athens has\r\nbeen equally deceived as to the surest means of safeguarding Hellenic\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\nAccording to the treaty of alliance with Serbia of 16-29th June, 1913,\r\nGreece was bound to come to the help of her ally, in case the latter were\r\nattacked by any third power. This article was clear. It is needless to\r\nharp on the point, for even without a treaty, it was a vital necessity\r\nfor Greece not to let the Bulgarians upset the balance of power, to\r\nher detriment, in the Balkans and intrude themselves between her and\r\nSerbia. That necessity imperiously required the government of Athens\r\nnot to suffer Serbia to be crushed. Now, as we know, the allied armies\r\nunder General Sarrail at the end of 1915 very nearly effected a junction\r\nwith the troops of the Voivode Putnik. It is, therefore, manifest that\r\nif, on the landing of the Allies at Salonika, Greece had joined her\r\nefforts to theirs, Serbia would have been saved. That is a truth which\r\nM. Venizelos and a great part of Greek public opinion well understood,\r\nbut King Constantine would not admit it. History will prove whether in\r\nthis grave crisis of his country his relationship of brother-in-law to\r\nthe Kaiser did not greatly prejudice the judgment of the King of Greece.\r\nWhat is certain is, that no rational explanation has yet been given of\r\nKing Constantine’s conduct, and that his policy has elicited the protests\r\nof Greek colonies in foreign countries, which, being free to speak,\r\ndeclared, in an appeal drawn up by their congresses in February, 1916:\r\n\r\n“While we nurse a meaningless neutrality which provokes derision, we run\r\nthe risk, not only of failing to achieve the aspirations bequeathed to\r\nus by our fathers, but also of losing our independence” (quoted by _Le\r\nTemps_, 26th February, 1916).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GREECE AFTER THE TREATY OF BUKAREST.]\r\n\r\nThe vehemence of these protests is intelligible, for just in virtue of\r\nthe policy which for some months the government of Athens has pursued,\r\nGreece is now confronted by vital problems which she must absolutely\r\nsolve without delay, if she would ensure her future.\r\n\r\nThe annexed map, which represents the state of Greece before and after\r\nthe war, will render intelligible the essential interests which Greece\r\nhas to defend.\r\n\r\nGreece has always taken deeply to heart the many Greeks living in the\r\nEast outside her boundaries. She would either incorporate them or at\r\nleast ensure them a tolerable existence.\r\n\r\nThese Greeks are to be found in the ethnographical regions indicated by\r\ncross hatchings on the map, which I have copied exactly from the map No.\r\n2 in the _Pangerman Atlas_ of Paul Langhans, published at Gotha by Justus\r\nPerthes in 1900. Thus the Pangermans themselves recognize the presence\r\nof many Greeks in the south of Albania and especially in Bulgaria and\r\nTurkey. No doubt, since the Balkan wars the density of the Greeks in\r\nthe Hellenic regions of Bulgaria and Turkey has undergone serious\r\nmodifications. Many of these Greeks have been massacred either by the\r\nTurks or by the Bulgarians. Under the pressure of these Turko-Bulgarian\r\npersecutions about 500,000 Greeks have been obliged, since 1912, to take\r\nrefuge in Greece. But the Greeks who have sources of exact information\r\nestimate that there still remain about 200,000 Greeks on the Ægean coasts\r\nof new Bulgaria, and 2,300,000 in the Ottoman empire. It is clear that\r\nif Bulgaria and Turkey, by the help of Germany, were finally victorious,\r\nthese 2,500,000 Greeks would be lost once and for all to Greece.\r\nTherefore, if the government of Athens would save the Greeks, it has a\r\nprimary and fundamental reason for speedily withstanding the progress\r\nof the Bulgarians as well as of the Turks. In point of fact the Ottoman\r\nGreeks are actually harassed most systematically by the fanatical young\r\nTurks. On the other hand the Russian successes in Armenia make a profound\r\nimpression on public opinion at Athens, if not on the government of King\r\nConstantine. The Greeks of Greece are too well acquainted with the\r\ndecadence of the Ottoman empire not to know that its days are numbered.\r\nThe majority of Greeks understand that the moment is approaching when,\r\nby joining the Allies, the adversaries of Turkey, Greece should secure\r\nfor herself a voice in their councils, in order that, when peace is\r\nconcluded, she may be able to shape the destinies of the Greeks of Turkey\r\nin conformity with Greek interests. This is all the more necessary\r\nbecause these Greeks of Turkey, as the map shows, are in the peculiar\r\nposition of being dispersed in small groups over the Ottoman coasts,\r\nwithout anywhere forming an aggregate large enough to confer the right of\r\nbeing treated as a definite part of the Ottoman empire.\r\n\r\nWith regard to Bulgaria, the interest of Greece is twofold. It\r\nconsists, in the first place, in preventing, as speedily as possible, a\r\ncontinuation of those systematic persecutions, deportations, outrages and\r\nrobberies of which the Greeks of Turkey and of the invaded regions of\r\nSerbia are at present the victims. But, above all, Greece has a really\r\nvital interest in preventing the government of Sofia from carrying out\r\nits plan of supremacy in the Balkans (see the map on p. 133). It is\r\nwell known at Athens that the Bulgarians covet Salonika, and that if,\r\neven without including that city, Great Bulgaria extended to Albania,\r\nGreece would thereby be cut off from the north of Europe by a rancorous\r\nand implacable neighbour, and would thus find herself in an untenable\r\nposition, alike from the military and the economic point of view. It is\r\nthis serious danger that is emphasized by the organs of M. Venizelos,\r\nwho since 1909 has been truly the saviour of Greece. As this conviction\r\nis deeply rooted in the heart of almost all Greeks, who view with\r\nirreconcilable aversion the Bulgarians as their hereditary enemies, it\r\nconstitutes a mental factor which, more than any other motive, will at\r\nlast, in all probability, open the eyes of Greece to the danger which\r\nshe incurs through the alliance of the Bulgarians and the Germans.\r\n\r\nBut though the Pangerman plan in itself threatens the interests of\r\nGreece most directly, we must recognize that this truth has not yet\r\nbeen sufficiently apprehended by Greek public opinion. Nevertheless, it\r\nis manifest that Great Germany’s ultimate aim is to rule at Salonika,\r\nperhaps not at first directly, but at all events through the agency\r\nof the Prussianized Bulgarians. But the great railway which, starting\r\nfrom Vienna, goes by Belgrade, Nisch, Uskub, and Salonika, now ends\r\nat the Piræus, since, quite lately, the junction has been effected by\r\nthe continuation of the Greek line of Larissa from Papapouli to Guida,\r\na station on the trunk line from Salonika to Monastir. In consequence\r\nof this junction line, 96 kilometres long, a great Continental railway\r\nhas just been completed, which, after peace has been concluded, will\r\nhave a considerable economic importance for Greece and even for the\r\nwhole of Europe. In fact, the distance of Marseilles from Alexandria\r\nis 1,404 sea miles, that of Brindisi from Alexandria is 836, and that\r\nof the Piræus from Alexandria is only 514. Supposing, then, that the\r\naverage speed of the mail steamers is 15 miles an hour, we infer that\r\nthe voyage to Alexandria takes about 93 hours from Marseilles, 55 from\r\nBrindisi, and only 34 from the Piræus. The new railway will therefore be\r\ngreatly preferable, not only for travellers, but for perishable goods\r\nand for the post. Hence it is indisputable that, after the peace, part\r\nof the sea traffic of Europe will be transferred from Marseilles and the\r\nItalian ports to the Piræus. From this transference of economic activity\r\ncertain and important profits will accrue to Greece, to say nothing of\r\nthe considerable portion of the wealthy classes of the Continent, who\r\nspend some months of every year in Egypt, and who will then stop at\r\nAthens before embarking and make tours to the classical ruins, leaving\r\nbehind them, as tourists do, quite appreciable sums of money, which will\r\nbe a clear gain to the country. If Serbia is re-established, Greece is\r\ncertain to draw all the profits from this new situation. On the contrary,\r\nwere the Pangerman designs in the Balkans to succeed, it would be Great\r\nGermany that would secure for herself all the advantages to be got from\r\nthe great new trunk railway through the Balkans, the control of which\r\nshe covets as usual. But it is clear that if Germany triumphed, nothing\r\ncould prevent her from stretching her economic tentacles over Salonika,\r\nthe Piræus, and the whole of Greece, so that in this form also the\r\nindependence of Greece would be doomed.\r\n\r\nConsequently, the Pangerman plan threatens all the vital interests of\r\nGreece, since its success would necessarily entail for that country an\r\neconomic invasion, the ruin of Hellenism, and Bulgarian supremacy in the\r\nBalkans. On the contrary, nothing but a victory of the Entente powers\r\ncan save Greece from these dangers. Greek public opinion understands\r\nthis better and better. Moreover, in a letter published by _Le Temps_ of\r\n20th February, 1916, Prince Nicolas of Greece, the able diplomat of the\r\nroyal family, plainly proposed to clear up loyally the misunderstandings\r\nthat exist between the government of Athens and the Entente. In this\r\nletter the following declarations are particularly memorable, because\r\ncoming from the brother of the King of Greece, they have a bearing which\r\nis sufficiently obvious. “There are only two currents in Greece: the\r\none impels Greece to throw herself into the struggle on the side of the\r\nEntente, the other favours neutrality. But nobody has ever uttered the\r\nthought that in this war we should have taken part on the side of the\r\nCentral Powers. Greece has remained neutral. She has never declared that\r\nnothing could induce her to abandon her neutrality.”\r\n\r\nOn March 9th, the _Patris_ of Athens published an article of General\r\nDanglis, formerly Minister of War in the Venizelos Cabinet, which\r\nconcluded thus: “Greece ought without delay to proceed to the revision of\r\nall the classes of her army capable of being called up for service; for\r\nwithout any doubt Greece will be obliged to employ her forces during the\r\npresent war” (see _Le Temps_, 10th March, 1916).\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nThe serious consequence which Germany’s alliance with Bulgaria would\r\nentail on Roumania, must ultimately oblige that country, despite the\r\ntemporizing attitude of its government, to defend its vital interests.\r\nThese interests now stand out more and more clearly. In the first place\r\nit is certain that the plan of Bulgarian supremacy in the Balkans (see\r\np. 133) is as little acceptable to the Roumanians as to the Greeks.\r\nThe frontier incidents, which have multiplied lately, between the\r\nBulgarians and the Roumanians are manifest symptoms of the mutual and\r\nirreconcilable dislike of the two peoples. Besides, the Roumanians have\r\nbeen specially alarmed by what has happened in the part of the Dobrudja\r\nwhich Bulgaria was compelled to cede to Roumania in 1913 (indicated by\r\ncrossed hatchings on the subjoined map). The syndicates of Bulgarian\r\npeasants in this region have plainly shown their separatist tendencies.\r\nFurther, it has lately been discovered that in the New Dobrudja,\r\nthe Bulgarian system of espionage has been worked, under colour of\r\narchæological excursions, by Germans, who afterwards transmitted to\r\nthe Bulgarian military authorities photographs and plans of great\r\nimportance. Lastly, at the beginning of 1916 Mr. Take Jonescu made known\r\nat Bukarest that Germany had promised to Bulgaria, at the expense of\r\nRoumania, not only the territory which Bulgaria had lost in 1913, but\r\nalso the Roumanian Dobrudja as far as Galatz and Sulina. Since then\r\nBerlin has been obliged to throw a sop to Roumania by assuring Bukarest\r\nthat Germany will put a curb on Bulgarian ambition. But this promise, a\r\nsort of blackmail extorted by the needs of the moment, forms but a very\r\nprecarious guarantee for the Roumanians. They feel themselves threatened\r\nby Bulgarian ambitions, and there seems little reason to doubt that as\r\nsoon as circumstances shall appear favourable, Roumania will make an\r\nend of the Bulgarian peril, as “she ought to have done in 1913,” if the\r\nRoumanian Government does not allow itself to be “hypnotized” by that of\r\nBerlin, to use the language of the _Universal_, the official connection\r\nof which with the military authorities at Bukarest is well known (quoted\r\nby _Le Temps_, 19th March, 1916).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GREAT ROUMANIA.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand the national policy of Roumania is influenced in the\r\nhighest degree by the two questions of Bessarabia and Transylvania. As\r\nthe map on the opposite page shows, Roumania _irredenta_ is composed of\r\ntwo great racial and territorial elements: about 1,000,000 Roumanians\r\nlive in Russian Bessarabia, but 3,700,000 Roumanians inhabit Transylvania\r\nand Bukovina, that is to say, vast regions of Hungary and Austria. The\r\nRoumanian ideal, in its entirety, would evidently be to incorporate at\r\nthe same time the Roumanian brothers of the East and the West, but as the\r\nideal is not practicable, a choice must be made. The partisans of Germany\r\nat Bukarest, led by M. Carp and Marghiloman, maintain that Roumania\r\nshould elect for Bessarabia and therefore march against Russia. To this\r\nthe practical politicians of Bukarest reply: “We should certainly be\r\nglad to incorporate the Roumanians of Bessarabia also, but that policy\r\nwould only be possible if Russia were completely destroyed by Germany,\r\nwhich has not been done and cannot be done, for the facts so far prove\r\nthat Russia could not be decisively beaten. Therefore Roumania cannot be\r\nsuch a fool as to incur the permanent hostility of the enormous empire\r\nof the Tzar. Moreover, in order to incorporate the 1,000,000 Roumanians\r\nof Bessarabia, we must abandon the 3,700,000 Roumanians of Transylvania,\r\nbesides accepting into the bargain the supremacy of the Bulgarians in the\r\nBalkans, since they are the allies of the Central Empires.”\r\n\r\nSuch are the essential arguments which incline Roumanian opinion to make\r\na decided choice for the acquisition of Transylvania. In order that the\r\nrelations between Russia and Roumania should become cordial enough to\r\npermit of an alliance between St. Petersburg and Bukarest it remains,\r\nperhaps, for Russia to reassure Roumania with regard to the control of\r\nthe Straits. It is certainly well understood at Bukarest that after the\r\nenormous sacrifices which she has made Russia cannot consent to remain\r\nbottled up by the Turks in the Black Sea, and that after the peace she\r\nmust hold a preponderant position at Constantinople. On the other hand,\r\nit is the interest of all Europe and of Russia herself that she should\r\nensure for the future a large amount of liberty in the control of the\r\nStraits. I cannot see, therefore, why Bukarest and Petrograd should not\r\ncome to an understanding on this important subject.\r\n\r\nIn order to prevent, or at least retard, the intervention of Roumania, of\r\nwhich Berlin is much afraid, the Kaiser’s diplomacy is putting pressure\r\non Vienna and on Budapest in order to obtain “large concessions” in\r\nfavour of the Roumanians of Transylvania and Bukovina. But at Bukarest\r\npeople know by experience the value to be attached to the promises of\r\nVienna, and especially to those of the Magyar nobility. Besides, as\r\nRoumania desires the annexation, pure and simple, of Transylvania and\r\nof the Roumanian region of Bukovina, she could not be content with mere\r\nconcessions. So the offers of the Central Empires at Bukarest have little\r\nchance of being seriously considered.\r\n\r\nThey will have still less, if the Roumanians yield to the force of\r\nevidence by recognizing, that even if the Pangerman plan were to provide\r\nfor the cession of Transylvania to Roumania, at the expense of Hungary,\r\nthat plan would still threaten their independence in the most direct\r\nand indisputable manner. In her attempt to win Roumania to her side,\r\nBerlin has promised to give Bessarabia, with Odessa, to Roumania at\r\nthe expense of Russia. In order to appreciate the character and the\r\nsincerity of this offer, the Roumanians need only refer to the pamphlet\r\nlong ago circulated by the _Alldeutscher Verband_, which sets forth the\r\nfundamental plan of 1894, and which I have often quoted. It bears the\r\ntitle, _Great Germany and Central Europe in 1950_. On p. 36 that work\r\ndefines as follows the fate which Pangermanism has in store for Roumania\r\non the East. “In the case of a victorious war against Russia, Roumania\r\nmight get Upper Bessarabia as far as the Dniester. Austria would annex\r\nLower Bessarabia in the form of a Margraviate of Bessarabia, and by means\r\nof the German colonies, which already exist, she would transform it into\r\na purely German region. The boundaries of this Austro-German Margraviate\r\nof Bessarabia would include the cities of Odessa, Bender, Borodino,\r\nFormosa, Beni, Ismail, and the mouths of the Danube at Sulina. A\r\nreciprocal exchange of populations with the neighbouring countries would\r\neasily ensure the exclusively German colonization of this Margraviate.\r\nGerman ships of war would mount guard at the mouth of the German Danube.”\r\nThis fundamental plan, which dates from twenty-one years ago, would now\r\nbe completed, as we saw (p. 133) by the ultimate establishment in the\r\nRoumanian Dobrudja of the Bulgarians, who would thus be in direct contact\r\nwith the new Margraviate of Prussianized Austria.\r\n\r\nHence, supposing the Germans were victorious, the Roumanians, who\r\nhave been much alarmed by the idea of seeing the Russians installed\r\nat Constantinople, would be confronted by the danger of being soon\r\nentirely cut off from both the Black Sea and from the Mediterranean. The\r\nBulgarians would take possession of the Roumanian Dobrudja, the Germans\r\nwould remain at Constantinople and the Dardanelles, _where they are\r\nalready_, and besides they would be dominant at Odessa and the mouths\r\nof the Danube, according to the plan drawn up, as far back as 1844, by\r\nthe future Marshal Moltke (_see_ p. 4). The authority of that name may\r\nsatisfy the Roumanians that the scheme is no mere fantasy.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it is plain enough that were Roumania once encircled, she could\r\nno longer dream of creating, as she so ardently desires to do, a national\r\nindustry, since she would be no more than an economic territory reduced\r\nto impotence, a mere dumping-ground for goods made in Pangermany.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, we see that this is really a question of life or death for\r\nRoumania. A Prussian victory, in fact, would imperil her national\r\nindependence in the most direct and indubitable manner. It appears\r\nthat the general opinion in Roumania is alive to the danger and to the\r\nnecessity of Roumanian intervention in the conflict. It remains to be\r\nseen whether German influences at Bukarest will be adroit enough and\r\npowerful enough to delude the Roumanian authorities into shilly-shallying\r\ntill the decisive hour shall have come and gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nGERMAN MANŒUVRES TO PLAY THE ALLIES THE TRICK OF THE “DRAWN GAME,” THAT\r\nIS, TO SECURE THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THE “HAMBURG TO THE PERSIAN GULF”\r\nSCHEME AS THE MINIMUM RESULT OF THE WAR.\r\n\r\n    I. The exceptional importance of the economic union of the\r\n    Central Empires, and the danger for the Allies of establishing\r\n    a connexion between that union and their own economic measures\r\n    after the war.\r\n\r\n    II. Reasons for the Turco-German dodge of making a separate\r\n    peace between the Ottoman empire and the Allies.\r\n\r\n    III. Why a separate and premature peace with Bulgaria would\r\n    play the Pangerman game.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the moment when this book is published, the Germans have certainly not\r\nrenounced the hope of keeping and establishing a definite claim to the\r\nterritories which they actually occupy on the West and on the East; but\r\nwith their usual foresight they nevertheless contemplate the possibility\r\nof their having to consent to evacuate on the West, let us say, 90,478\r\nsquare kilometres, and on the East 260,000 square kilometres, in order to\r\npreserve almost entire the principal part of the Pangerman acquisitions,\r\nthat is to say, the gains made, directly or indirectly, to the South\r\nand South-east, namely, Austria-Hungary (676,616 square kilometres),\r\nthe Balkans (215,585 square kilometres), Turkey (about 1,792,000 square\r\nkilometres). Total, 2,684,201 square kilometres.\r\n\r\nTo maintain its dominion over these territories, the government of Berlin\r\nis from now onward directing its energies to three sorts of manœuvres,\r\nall very astute, and very well co-ordinated, though they wear different\r\naspects, each corresponding to each of the three territorial stages\r\nessential to the achievement of the scheme “from Hamburg to the Persian\r\nGulf.” These three stages are Austria-Hungary, Turkey, and Bulgaria,\r\nwhich last forms the bridge between the two other stages.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nAs regards Austria-Hungary the Berlin programme may be summed up as\r\nfollows: _to take advantage of the occupation of the territories of the\r\nHapsburg Monarchy by the troops of William II. in order to impose, by\r\nall possible means, both on Hungary and on Austria, a series of measures\r\ncalled an economic union with Germany, which would leave Austria-Hungary\r\nan appearance of independence sufficient to throw dust in the eyes of\r\nthe Allies, while at the same time it would in fact subject that empire\r\nabsolutely to the will of Berlin_.\r\n\r\nSo far, these tactics have not succeeded in putting on a semblance of\r\nlegality. Since the outbreak of war, the Pangermans of Vienna have not\r\neven dared to summon the Austrian parliament, knowing very well that\r\nthe Slav and Latin deputies would protest most vehemently against the\r\nsubjection of their respective countries to the German empire. At present\r\nthe Germans of Vienna, while they terrorize the Austrian Slavs and try to\r\npersuade them that the Allies have forsaken them, are striving to prepare\r\na meeting of the Reichsrath which might seem to sanction all that has\r\nbeen done. But the reader will understand that it is no easy matter to\r\nget up this farce, when he learns that even the Magyars, who have linked\r\nthemselves closely to Germany, are beginning to resist, now that Berlin\r\nis forced to disclose those measures of enslavement, of which Hungary\r\nmust feel the effects, like the other States destined to pass under the\r\nPangerman yoke. It is said that William II.’s great Magyar accomplice,\r\nCount Tisza himself, is protesting. At all events in the _Pesti Hirlap_\r\nof Budapest, of 12th April, 1916, we are assured that his friend, the\r\nSenator Eugène Rakosky, has just published the following lines, which are\r\nparticularly significant:\r\n\r\n“All this Central European ferment will have no other result than\r\ncompelling the Hungarians to pull the chestnuts out of the fire for the\r\nGermans. They want us to make high roads for the Germans to the East.\r\nAll these Central European alliances and unions mean nothing but that we\r\nare expected to sell our national soul and pass under the German yoke”\r\n(quoted by _Le Temps_, 19th April, 1916).\r\n\r\nBut the Allies should have no illusion on this head. The most vehement\r\nprotests of the Magyars will be of no avail. The Germans are in\r\noccupation of Austria-Hungary and they have the power. They may disguise\r\ntheir enslavement of this vast empire under various formulas, such as\r\nextension of the _Zollverein_, economic union of the Central Empires,\r\nunification of the commercial laws of Austria and Germany, etc.; or they\r\nmay even, as a subterfuge, to lull the fears of the Allies to sleep, give\r\nup the use of any positive formula, the final result will always be the\r\nsame, the political seizure by Germany of the Hapsburg Monarchy cloaked\r\nunder the decent pretext of economic measures.\r\n\r\nTo this object the Germans cling above everything else, because it\r\nhas been the basis of the whole Pangerman plan since 1895, and the\r\nindispensable condition of achieving the scheme “from Hamburg to the\r\nPersian Gulf,” as the reader will find explained, with the reasons in\r\nfull, in my book published fifteen years ago, _L’Europe et la Question\r\nd’Autriche au seuil du XXᵉ siècle_; they cling to it, too, because\r\nGermany has made war for the very purpose of effecting at least this\r\nseizure of Austria-Hungary, which is absolutely indispensable to the\r\nplans of William II.\r\n\r\nNothing but the complete victory of the Allies can compel Berlin to\r\nrenounce this plan of domination and liberate the non-German peoples\r\nof the Hapsburg Monarchy. Meantime the Germans are taking all possible\r\nprecautions against such an event. We have seen (p. 93) how already,\r\nunder their pressure, the Magyars are concerting with them the economic\r\nmeasures to be taken in view of that future war, which is to complete the\r\nresults of a peace which Berlin already thinks bound to be “imperfect.”\r\nAccordingly, the Allies cannot have the faintest doubt as to the new war\r\nwhich as sure as fate will follow, sooner or later, from the economic and\r\nnecessarily political union of the Central Empires. In Chapter V we saw\r\nthat the certain consequence of this economic union would be:\r\n\r\n1º. To secure to Germany the spoils of war and a trade monopoly over\r\nnearly 3 millions of square kilometres containing wealth untold.\r\n\r\n2º. On the contrary, to leave the Allies to pay all their expenses in the\r\nwar, which is equivalent to condemning their peoples to ruin.\r\n\r\n3º. To make Prussian militarism more powerful than ever, since, radiating\r\nfrom the block of Central Europe, it could command an army of from 15 to\r\n21 millions of soldiers.\r\n\r\n4º. To give Germany the supremacy over the majority of essential\r\nstrategic points on land and sea, which would provide Berlin with all\r\nthe means for executing gradually and completely its plan of world-wide\r\ndomination.\r\n\r\nBut it seems that these formidable consequences, which flow from the\r\nseizure of Austria-Hungary by Germany, have not yet been sufficiently\r\nunderstood in the Allied countries. That is the conclusion indicated\r\nby the following opinions which have been published in some French and\r\nEnglish newspapers: “The declarations of Mr. Runciman, President of the\r\nBoard of Trade in the United Kingdom,” says _Le Temps_ of 25th March,\r\n1916, “prove that Great Britain is resolved to work without delay for the\r\nformation of an economic alliance against the powers of Central Europe.”\r\n\r\nMr. Hughes, Prime Minister of Australia, in an address at the Carlton\r\nClub, gave his hearers to understand that the German Empire must not\r\nbe allowed to hope to reduce other countries to a state of commercial\r\ndependence upon it (see _Le Temps_, 23rd March, 1916). In consequence\r\nof these declarations an idea was formed of an economic understanding\r\nbetween the Allies in order, according to _Le Petit Parisien_, “to make\r\nan effective reply to the project of a Central Europe conceived by our\r\nenemies.”\r\n\r\nM. Jules Siegfried, in a letter to the _Temps_, 3rd April, 1916,\r\naffirmed, with reference to this: “Germany, aware of the danger, is\r\nseeking to form a Customs-union with Austria, Bulgaria, and Turkey. It\r\nis therefore necessary for us to guard against this danger.” Mr. Hewins,\r\nchairman of the Business Committee of the House of Commons, stated at\r\nLondon on April 6th: “But France and England, after their victory, will\r\npossess a preponderance over the Austro-German union which will enable\r\nthem to dictate their tariffs, etc.” (see _L’Echo de Paris_, 7th April,\r\n1916). M. Edmond Théry, in _Le Matin_ of 13th April, 1916, discussing the\r\nsame problem, concluded: “If, therefore, the Allied nations will erect\r\nsimultaneously and under identical conditions a powerful Customs barrier\r\nbetween their respective home markets and the products of Germany and\r\nher accomplices, this of itself will suffice to strike a mortal blow at\r\nGerman industry, commerce, and credit.”\r\n\r\nThese declarations are amazing. How can the economic problem to be solved\r\nby the Allies be placed, even through an obvious “inadvertence,” on a\r\nbasis so manifestly inaccurate? How, in fact, can we voluntarily admit\r\nthe least connection between the economic conference of the Allies and\r\nthe economic union of the Central empires, since that union is clearly\r\nin flagrant contradiction with the general object of the war, which\r\nnevertheless, the Allies are perfectly at one in pursuing? In fact, to\r\nkeep repeating that the Allies must form an economic alliance of the\r\nAllies to compete after the war against the economic union of Central\r\nEurope, and to prevent the German Empire from reducing other countries\r\nbesides Austria-Hungary to a commercial dependence on itself, this is, in\r\nstrict logic, to assume that the Allies agree to let Prussianized Germany\r\nlay hands on the 50 million inhabitants of Austria-Hungary, which would\r\nsecure for Berlin the means of carrying out her scheme of domination\r\n“from Hamburg to the Persian Gulf.” But it is clear that this result is\r\nradically incompatible with the higher ideal aim of the war which the\r\nAllies propose as their goal, the aim which their governments incessantly\r\nproclaim, that is, the destruction of Prussian militarism.\r\n\r\nThere has therefore unquestionably been a mistake on the part of\r\nsome French and English authorities, who are in other respects well\r\nqualified, in the way they have put the question and in the association\r\nof their ideas. This mistake is doubtless explained by the fact that\r\nin England loose ideas are still prevalent as to the Pangerman plan\r\nand Austria-Hungary. Many people on the other side of the Channel\r\nstill imagine that the majority of the population of that Empire is\r\nGerman, whereas on the principle of nationalities, Germany could at\r\nmost incorporate 7 or 8 millions of Germans at present subjects of the\r\nHapsburg (_see_ p. 126). These loose ideas prevalent in England are\r\nvery difficult to eradicate. It is these ideas which are at the root\r\nof the mistakes made by our British Allies in regard to the Balkans\r\nand Salonika, whereas, on account of Egypt and India, England was more\r\ninterested than all the other Allies in the rapid execution of that\r\nexpedition.\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, as the Allies cannot indulge in the sanguinary luxury\r\nof fresh serious blunders, it is necessary to show why the project\r\nof an economic understanding between the Allies should be absolutely\r\nindependent of the Berlin project of a Central European Union.\r\n\r\nIn point of fact, if this separation is not clearly effected, it will\r\nentail the following baneful consequences, which will delay still further\r\nthe victory to gain which the Allied peoples are making such gigantic\r\nsacrifices.\r\n\r\n1º. To allow it to be understood in the newspapers of the Allies, even by\r\ninadvertence, that the Allies could possibly admit of the economic union\r\nwhich Germany intends to force on Austria-Hungary, would be to furnish\r\nthe German newspapers with a cordial for reviving the fainting spirits of\r\nthe German nation; for in that case the German journalists would point\r\nout to their people that they can still count on carrying out the main\r\npart of the Pangerman plan, which they regard as the essential object of\r\nthe war.\r\n\r\n2º. The German scheme of capturing Austria-Hungary in an economical net\r\nis radically incompatible with the pledges which the Allies have given\r\nto Serbia. In his toast to the Prince of Serbia, M. Poincaré declared:\r\n“Acting with the Serbian army, the Allies will liberate the Serbian\r\nterritory, will re-establish the independence and the sovereignty of\r\nyour noble country on a solid foundation, and will vindicate the rights\r\nwhich have been infringed” (see _Le Temps_, 23rd March, 1916). Now a\r\nmere glance at the map (p. 79) suffices to show that the capture of\r\nAustria-Hungary by Germany would render the fulfilment of that solemn\r\npromise impossible. Once in contact with the Balkans, Germany would be\r\nthe mistress of these countries, and for Serbia that would be a sentence\r\nof death.\r\n\r\n3º. To allow it to be supposed that the project of an economic union\r\nbetween Germany and Austria-Hungary could be even contemplated by the\r\nAllies, would be to give over to an agony of despair the 28 million Slav\r\nand Latin subjects of the Hapsburg Monarchy, who look to the Allies as\r\ntheir deliverers, and who, just because of their sympathies with the\r\nAllied cause, are subjected to the most atrocious persecution. There can\r\nbe no doubt that the German press would catch at any ambiguous phrases in\r\nthe utterances of the Allied press about the “economic union” of Central\r\nEurope in order to persuade these poor wretches that the Allies have\r\nforsaken them for good and all, and that there is nothing left for them,\r\nbut to bow their neck to the German-Magyar yoke. But it is manifestly the\r\npolitical and military interest of the Allies at the moment to let the\r\nSlavs and Latins of Austria-Hungary know at once that they may rely on\r\nthe Allies, and that the victory of the Allied cause would mean the end\r\nof their own serfdom. To attain that result of the war is unquestionably\r\na moral duty for the Allies; but more than that it is in strict\r\nconformity with their own future interest, for the independence of 28\r\nmillion Slavs and Latins of Austria-Hungary is absolutely indispensable\r\nto the establishment of a new and lasting Europe, founded on the\r\nprinciple of nationalities, and capable of forming at the same time in\r\nCentral Europe a barrier, which Pangermanism in arms will for the future\r\nbe powerless to overleap.\r\n\r\n4º. Every mistake, or appearance of a mistake, as to the treatment which\r\nthe Western Allies intend to mete out to Austria-Hungary would excite\r\nthe liveliest protests among our Russian Allies. As M. Milioukoff well\r\nsaid in a speech to the Duma: “When we have wound up bankrupt Turkey,\r\nas we are now doing, it will be necessary to wind up another bankrupt\r\nconcern, and that is Austria-Hungary. We are certain that the numerous\r\nnationalities which form part of the Dual Monarchy will receive their\r\nliberty at the hands of Russia” (quoted by _Le Temps_, 27th March, 1916).\r\nBut the point of view set forth by M. Milioukoff, which is that of\r\neverybody who really knows Austria-Hungary (see p. 118), must be shared\r\nby all the Allies, since they intend to destroy Prussian militarism and\r\nclearly do not wage the most frightful of all wars for the purpose of\r\nseeing militant Prussia emerge from the struggle infinitely more powerful\r\nthan she entered into it.\r\n\r\nThese many and forcible reasons make it clear how necessary it is that\r\nthere should be no possible ambiguity in the Allied press as to the\r\neconomic conference of the Allies. It is all very well for the conference\r\nto look ahead to the time when peace shall have been concluded, to take\r\n“concerted measures to counteract the dirty tricks by which Germany has\r\ncompassed the destruction of her rivals,” to forestall fresh German\r\ndepredations, in time of peace, on the financial establishments of\r\nthe Allies, to prevent the Germans from manipulating the Custom-house\r\ntariffs, with all their usual dexterity, and so forth. This is all\r\nvery well; nothing better; but on no account let there be, even in\r\nappearance, the least connexion between these theoretical measures of the\r\nAllies and the pretensions of Berlin to establish the economic union of\r\nCentral Europe. Besides, as Mr. Lloyd George has said, with his robust\r\ngood sense: “Before discussing the commercial system to be adopted after\r\nthe war, we must first win the war. Everything depends on that” (quoted\r\nby _Le Temps_, 25th March). But the war will not be really won till every\r\nrevival of aggressive Pangermanism shall have been rendered impossible;\r\nand this implies nothing less than the most energetic opposition to\r\nGermany’s attempt to capture the majority of the countries which actually\r\ncompose the empire of the Hapsburgs.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nA cunning manœuvre for saving the future of Pangermanism and of Enver\r\nPasha’s gang in Turkey has already been broached by the Germans. As it\r\nwill certainly be attempted again, should it be in the interest of Berlin\r\nto push it through (and everything points that way), it becomes necessary\r\nto unmask it completely beforehand. In February, 1916, numerous Turkish\r\nagents, installed in Switzerland and apparently working through spies in\r\nthe Allied countries, began to set afloat a rumour that Turkey was ready\r\nto conclude a separate peace. Enver Pasha had been assassinated (which of\r\ncourse was a lie), and so forth. The aim of this manœuvre was to secure\r\nin the Allied countries the assistance of those incorrigible fools,\r\narmed with the panoply of crass ignorance on the affairs of the East,\r\nwho nevertheless are not always without influence on men at the head\r\nof affairs. If I am rightly informed, this clever dodge of the Turkish\r\nagents did really succeed for a time in enlisting some of the fools I\r\nspeak of. In the opinion of these gentry the conclusion of a separate\r\npeace with Turkey would have been a very good move, since it would have\r\ndeprived Germany of the help of her Ottoman ally, etc. These are very\r\ndangerous illusions, and it is necessary to show how and why this measure\r\nwould play the game of Berlin and gravely imperil the victory of the\r\nAllies.\r\n\r\nThe Turks, greatly alarmed by the Russian successes in Armenia, see at\r\nthe same time their dream of a Panislamic movement fading away. They\r\nare obliged to acknowledge to themselves that the Germans are cynically\r\nusing them for their own selfish ends, are driving them along the road\r\nto famine by making a clean sweep of all their food supplies, and are\r\nsending them to slaughter for the higher interests of Pangermany. But\r\nwhile the mass of the Turks may very well feel their anger beginning\r\nto rise against the Germans, they are completely in the hands of the\r\nYoung-Turk ringleaders, who in their turn are bound over, hand and\r\nfoot, to the Germans; and more and more the Germans are masters of the\r\norgans of administration and government in Turkey. Therefore there is no\r\ncounting on an effective revolt of the Turkish population, who moreover\r\nare entirely destitute of the spirit of organization. On the other hand,\r\nthe Germans are far-seeing people and perfectly understand that Turkey\r\nis hastening towards a catastrophe. _But to bring about a separate peace\r\nbetween Turkey and the Allies would be equivalent to inducing the Allies\r\nto recognize the permanence of the Ottoman empire; it would thus save\r\nthat empire from disaster, and leave the door open for Berlin to re-open\r\nits old intrigues after the conclusion of a peace on the basis of the\r\n“drawn game”_ (see chap. V).\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, if the question of the Ottoman East is logically settled\r\nonce for all, all hope of carrying out at a later time the Pangerman\r\ndream “from Constantinople to the Persian Gulf” is finally shattered.\r\nMoreover, a separate peace would also serve the turn of the Young-Turk\r\nringleaders, for clearly nothing else could enable them to keep their\r\nhold on the reins of power, or could save them from being massacred by\r\ntheir fellow countrymen the day that the Ottoman crash comes. We see\r\ntherefore why the rumours of a separate peace between Turkey and the\r\nAllies, which have been circulated and afterwards denied, only to be\r\nstarted again, at some other time, are really a Turko-German manœuvre.\r\nBesides, the Arabian journal _Al-Mokattan_ of Cairo (22nd April, 1916)\r\nhas remarked that “a separate peace with Turkey would cause Germany no\r\nuneasiness, since the retirement of Turkey from the arena would relieve\r\nGermany from the need of helping the Turks, as she does at present.”\r\nFinally, the _Vossische Zeitung_ has confessed that “a separate peace\r\nbetween Turkey and the enemies of Germany would in no way prejudice\r\nAustro-German interests” (quoted by _Le Journal de Genève_, 25th April,\r\n1916).\r\n\r\nHowever, it is not to be supposed that the leaders of the Entente will\r\nallow themselves to be caught in the Turko-German trap. The Eastern\r\nquestion is a regular ulcer, which has envenomed European policy for\r\na hundred years; it is the nightmare of the chanceries. Every attempt\r\nto reform the Ottoman empire has always failed. The fact is that this\r\ndry-rotten State has only been bolstered up by the mutual rivalries of\r\nthe great powers. Since the victory of the Allies is bound to secure\r\nfor the Old World a very long period of peace, that perennial source\r\nof troubles and wars, the Turkish empire, must be stopped for good.\r\nMoreover, justice in its broader aspect demands the same solution of the\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NATIONALITIES IN TURKEY.]\r\n\r\nIn Turkey, as elsewhere, if the new settlement is to be endowed with a\r\npotentiality of life, the principle of nationalities must be followed\r\nas far as is practicable. Now, out of the 20 million inhabitants of the\r\nOttoman empire, four great nationalities (see the accompanying map)\r\naccount for about 18 millions. In the absence of statistics on which any\r\nreliance can be placed, it is estimated that there are in Turkey about:—\r\n\r\n    Two millions of Levantines, of Europeans, of Jews, and of\r\n    miscellaneous races.\r\n\r\n    Two millions of Greeks.\r\n\r\n    Two millions of Armenians.\r\n\r\n    Eight millions of Arabs.\r\n\r\n    Six millions only of Turks.\r\n\r\nAs for the Greeks, who unfortunately do not form a coherent body (see p.\r\n147), there are several solutions to be considered, with a view to giving\r\nthem a fraction of the Ottoman empire, if they throw themselves into the\r\nstruggle in the Balkans on the side of the Allies. With regard to the\r\nArabs, they detest the Turks, who have oppressed them for centuries.\r\nThe liberation of the Arabs from the Turkish yoke should therefore be\r\ncarried out so far as it is at all possible. As for the Armenians, of\r\nwhom several hundreds of thousands have just been massacred by the Turks,\r\nit is clearly impossible to contemplate the continuance of the remnant\r\nof this unhappy people under the iron heel of Enver Pasha, Talaat, and\r\nthe rest of that gang. With regard to the six millions, or thereabouts,\r\nof Turks, who represent less than the third of the population of the\r\nOttoman empire, they really inhabit only Anatolia, that is to say, the\r\nportion of the Ottoman empire included between the Black Sea and the\r\nMediterranean. Everywhere else the Turks are merely hated officials, who,\r\never since the conquest by the Osmanli Sultans, have cynically sucked dry\r\nthe other populations of the Ottoman empire. No doubt the Turkish peasant\r\nof Anatolia, when he is not a prey to one of those paroxysms of religious\r\nfanaticism which seize him periodically, is generally a good fellow. Very\r\nsober and long-suffering he makes an excellent soldier, but the mental\r\napparatus of your Anatolian Turk is several centuries behind the time. He\r\nis incapable of self-government in our modern age. It is true that there\r\nare some thousands of Turks who make excellent employees in the service\r\nof the Ottoman Debt, but only on condition of their being constantly\r\nsupervised and directed by European heads of departments. Among the\r\nTurks of Constantinople there is not a single group offering any serious\r\nguarantee for the guidance of the Turkish masses. If the Turkish\r\npeasant of Anatolia is undoubtedly endowed by nature with some sterling\r\nqualities, it is equally certain that the Turks of Constantinople, with\r\nfew exceptions, are corrupt to the marrow of their bones. In these\r\ncircumstances to imagine that a really independent Turkish empire could\r\nbe set up is to nurse an absurd chimera. As for Constantinople, it is\r\nnot even a Turkish city; it is essentially cosmopolitan. Its 1,200,000\r\ninhabitants consist of Turks (43 per cent.), Armenians (18 per cent.),\r\nGreeks (17 per cent.), Jews (16 per cent.), Europeans, Levantines, and\r\nmiscellaneous peoples (6 per cent.).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is plain enough that this amazing war cannot\r\nclose without allowing Russia to acquire a predominant position at\r\nConstantinople. Russia certainly did not want the war, but she has\r\nbeen compelled to wage it and to send millions of men to their death,\r\nwhile she has had to support a formidable financial burden. For these\r\ngigantic sacrifices Russia must receive compensation. The toll which\r\nRussia will take of Poland in return for the autonomy granted to her—a\r\ntoll which is both just and conformable to the common interest of the\r\nPoles as well as of the Russians—evidently cannot repay Russia for her\r\nenormous sacrifices. That necessary compensation, therefore, Russia must\r\nlook for elsewhere. Now a glance at the map, combined with a knowledge\r\nof the cosmopolitan character of Constantinople, will convince anybody\r\nthat Russia cannot continue to be bottled up in the Black Sea. While\r\nit is necessary to the peace of the new Europe that the control of\r\nthe Straits should be exercised under the direction of Russia on as\r\nliberal principles as possible, it is no less necessary for the West to\r\nunderstand that justice demands for Russia a preponderant position at\r\nConstantinople, even though the Western powers must make some undoubted\r\nsacrifices to secure that object. If the soldiers of the Tsar have given\r\nproof of unparalleled self-sacrifice, if, despite some cruel reverses,\r\nthey display an inflexible tenacity, it is because they are stirred\r\nby two motives—a hatred of the Germans who have poisoned the Russian\r\nbureaucracy, and the ardent wish for the fulfilment of that hope which\r\nanimates the poorest peasant in Russia, the hope of securing for Russia a\r\nfree outlet on the Mediterranean. These are the feelings, the depth and\r\npower of which M. Milioukoff put into words when he said to the Duma: “We\r\nshall not end the war without securing an outlet to the open sea. The\r\nannexation of the Straits will not be a territorial annexation, for vast\r\nRussia has no need of new territories, but she cannot prosper without\r\naccess to the open sea” (see _Le Journal de Genève_, 28th March, 1916).\r\nBut in spreading the rumour of a separate peace with Turkey the Germans\r\nexpect to derive the following advantage from the manœuvre. They reckon\r\nthat some Allied newspapers in the West will receive the idea favourably.\r\nThe Germans would immediately take advantage of that to stir up in Russia\r\na violent storm of indignation and doubt against the Western Allies.\r\nThe example of 1915 ought to serve the Allies as a warning against any\r\nimprudence in the press. It is not sufficiently known in France that last\r\nyear the Germans traded largely on the apparent inactivity of the French\r\ntroops, at the time when the Russians were obliged to endure their long\r\nretreat of five months. That inactivity was certainly not the effect\r\nof any ill will of the French towards their Russian allies; it was the\r\nconsequence of that baneful theory of the Western front considered as\r\nthe principal and exclusive theatre of war, a theory which prevented the\r\nintervention by way of Salonika, at a time when it might still have been\r\neasily effected, between May and July, 1915. Nevertheless, that apparent\r\ninactivity has been used by the Germans to excite discontent in Russia\r\nagainst the French, and their efforts have not been unsuccessful, for\r\nduring a long time many Russians were much annoyed with the French for an\r\ninactivity which seemed to them inexplicable. This instance may help us\r\nto understand what a disastrous effect would be produced in Russia by the\r\nnews that in the West the newspapers or influential circles contemplate\r\nas possible a separate peace with Turkey at the very moment when the\r\nRussian arms are more and more successful in Armenia, and when these\r\nsuccesses not only console the soldiers of the Tsar for their former\r\nreverses, but also render the Allies a substantial service by draining\r\nthe Balkan peninsula of Turkish troops, and thus facilitating the Allied\r\noffensive from Salonika Northward.\r\n\r\nSuch are the various results aimed at by the astute new dodge of a\r\nseparate peace with the Ottoman empire. Surely it is only necessary\r\nto recognize them to prevent the Allies from being caught in the new\r\nTurko-German trap.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nContemporaneously with the rumour of a separate peace with Turkey, in\r\nFebruary, 1916, a suggestion was mysteriously made to the Western Allies\r\nthat the Bulgarians also wished to treat with them. The two manœuvres, as\r\nwe shall see, are in fact closely connected. If the Bulgarians were to\r\ncome and say to the Allies: “We have been deceived, deluded by Berlin,\r\nwe have pursued an odious policy. As a proof of our good faith we will\r\nevacuate immediately the Serbian territories which we have invaded, and\r\nwe will do all in our power to undo the mischief we have done. Grant us\r\npeace on these terms”; in that case, clearly enough, there would be some\r\nreason for listening to Sofia. But it would be entirely to mistake the\r\ncharacter of the Bulgarians and of their government to imagine that\r\nthey could even dream of such a proposal. What the Bulgarians would like\r\nwell enough would be a peace with the Allies, which should allow them to\r\nretain their territorial acquisitions, the permanent character of which\r\nwas proclaimed by M. Radoslavoff on March 1st, 1916. Such a settlement,\r\nmoreover, as we shall see, would square exactly with the interests of\r\nSofia and Berlin.\r\n\r\nAt heart, the Bulgarians would be very glad of peace, since a\r\ncontinuation of the war can hardly procure for them any accession to what\r\nthey already hold. On the other hand, the offensive of the Allies from\r\nSalonika, if it is well organized, ought to mete out to the Bulgarians\r\nthe chastisement which they dread, especially since the check to the\r\nGermans before Verdun and the Russian successes in Armenia. The Bulgarian\r\npeople is moreover deeply discontented at the heavy losses which it has\r\nalready sustained by the sword and by disease in the campaign against\r\nSerbia. They see the whole of Bulgaria in the hands of German officers.\r\nAs for the Bulgarian army, it is in a very unsatisfactory state,\r\nwhich has already led to local mutinies and many desertions. In these\r\ncircumstances Bulgaria would evidently on all accounts do a good piece of\r\nbusiness if she were to make a separate peace with the Allies. It must\r\nbe clearly understood that this Bulgarian manœuvre is not openly avowed\r\nat Sofia; it is only carried on underhand, and probably, for the reasons\r\nwe shall see, with the connivance of Berlin. Nevertheless, it is very\r\ndangerous, for, it must be said in the interest of the common Allied\r\ncause and of the truth, it has found supporters in the Allied countries\r\namong those who combine an invincible fatuity with ideas on the Balkans\r\nwhich are forty years behind the time.\r\n\r\nThere are also some Russians who still imagine that in 1915 the Allied\r\ndiplomacy made a mistake in not undoing the consequences of the treaty\r\nof Bukarest; whereas in point of fact that is just what has been done,\r\nand what, as we saw in Chapter II., § I., constituted the fundamental\r\nerror of the Allied policy in the Balkans. According to these Russians\r\nthe treaty of Bukarest should have been set aside in order to restore\r\nBulgaria to the limits assigned to it by the treaty of San Stefano. This\r\nis the point of view maintained as late as March, 1916, by M. Milioukoff\r\nfrom the tribune of the Duma. I have explained (p. 138), why on the\r\nwest the Bulgaria of the San Stefano treaty by no means corresponded\r\nto the racial facts, and for what reasons Macedonia, forming the south\r\nof Serbia, is very far from being Bulgarian. A striking proof of it is\r\nthat the Bulgarians have just massacred there a quantity of Serbians.\r\nWith regard to the ethnography of the region we may introduce into the\r\ndiscussion a new argument, as original perhaps as it is convincing. To\r\ntell the truth the most accurate account of the ethnographic position\r\nof Macedonia is that which has been handed down to us for generations\r\nby the Cooks—it is a _Macédoine_. In the great dictionary of Larousse,\r\nvol. x, p. 855, edition of 1873, and therefore anterior by five years\r\nto the treaty of San Stefano (1878), we read: “_Macédoine_ (Macedonia),\r\na dish composed of a great number of different vegetables or fruits.\r\n‘This word,’ says Ch. Nodier, ‘was probably first applied to a very\r\nmiscellaneous dish in allusion to the incredible medley of peoples on\r\nwhom Philip and Alexander imposed the laws of Macedonia.’”\r\n\r\nNow these various peoples are the Turks, the Albanians, the Bulgarians,\r\nthe Jews, the Roumanians, and the Serbians, who inhabit the south of\r\nSerbia. Thus the ancient tradition handed down by the cooks, whose\r\nimpartiality in matters of ethnography will not be disputed, undoubtedly\r\ncontradicts the theory of the ethnographical unity of Bulgaria mapped\r\nout by the treaty of San Stefano; and it must be remembered that in\r\n1878 Russian diplomacy had special reasons, which no longer exist, for\r\ntreating the whole of that Bulgaria as exclusively Bulgarian. The words\r\nof M. Milioukoff prove that the erroneous ideas of 1878 still linger\r\nin the minds of some Russians. Happily among the vast majority of our\r\nEastern Allies the logic of facts has dissipated those sentimental\r\nleanings to Bulgaria which were once so strong. Indeed, the Bulgarians\r\nthemselves have powerfully assisted the Russians to arrive at a juster\r\nappreciation of the true situation. At the end of 1915, in the first\r\neffervescence of their affection for Germany, the newspapers of Sofia\r\nannounced that the Bulgarians are not Slavs but Tartar-Mongols, and that\r\nthis racial consideration, added to all the rest, goes to show that along\r\nwith the Turks and the Magyars they should form the “Turanian block,”\r\nwhich, in association with Germany, will master and hold down the Slavs\r\nand Latins in Europe. Hence the Bulgarian dodge of a separate peace\r\nwith the Allies has very little chance of being seriously considered in\r\nRussia. But unfortunately some of those same Englishmen, whose erroneous\r\ninformation greatly contributed to the Balkan mistakes of 1915, are\r\nactually supporting it. I shall only refer here to Englishmen who have\r\nno official position. Among them must particularly be named the brothers\r\nCharles and Noel Buxton, who have long been at the head of a committee\r\nwhich is called the Balkan Committee, but which in fact has always been\r\nsystematically Bulgarophile. Now by an odd coincidence the brothers\r\nBuxton have into the bargain Germanophile leanings. _Le Temps_ of January\r\n10th, 1916, noticed a curious book of theirs which had lately appeared,\r\nand which the journal described as “pacificist dreams.” These gentlemen\r\nappear to advocate a premature peace with Berlin as well as with Sofia,\r\na policy which is characteristic of them. Still more dangerous is the\r\nactivity of some underground workers who masquerade as correspondents of\r\nEnglish newspapers in the Balkans. Amongst them are some who, holding\r\nviews that were true enough in the time of Gladstone but are wrong\r\nto-day, systematically favour the Bulgarians. Such is their prejudice\r\nthat they have failed to see the bearing of the treaty of Bukarest, and\r\ndid not so much as suspect the existence of the treaties which Bulgaria\r\nconcluded with Germany and Turkey _in the spring of_ 1914, and which have\r\njust been disclosed by M. Radoslavoff (see p. 154). These correspondents,\r\nin virtue of the undeserved credit given them in London, contributed\r\nin large measure to delude the British authorities in 1915 as to the\r\ntrue intentions of Bulgaria down to the moment when it stepped into the\r\narena at the side of Germany. From this grievous error has resulted the\r\ncrushing of Serbia, with its manifold consequences. In spite of these\r\nplain facts staring them in the face, some incorrigible Englishmen are\r\nstill unconvinced. While they acknowledge the very great difficulties\r\nof the actual situation of the Bulgarians, they nevertheless arrive at\r\nthis paradoxical conclusion that the Allies should make peace with the\r\nBulgarians and suffer them to retain their present conquests.\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, this underhand agitation lately carried on in London\r\nby a few but very active agents, has naturally been reprobated by\r\nwell-informed British opinion. The English who in April, 1916, gave so\r\nwarm a reception to the Prince of Serbia, are apprehensive lest a new\r\nblunder should be perpetrated in the Balkans. To prevent that contingency\r\na question was put in the House of Commons on March 28th: “A member\r\nasked for an assurance that Bulgaria would not be admitted to a separate\r\npeace, and especially that she should not be permitted to acquire\r\nterritories at the expense of the peoples who have fought on the side\r\nof the Allies during the war” (see _L’Œuvre_, 29th March, 1916). This\r\nBritish resolution is in harmony with the interests, moral and material,\r\nrecent and future, of the Allies.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it is useless to reckon, as some misguided people\r\nhave done, on a really effective popular Bulgarian rising against the\r\ngovernment. Tsar Ferdinand has always done just what he pleased in\r\nBulgaria, and now that he is hand in glove with Berlin, the Germans\r\nwill furnish him with the force needed to keep him on the throne. As\r\nfor the Bulgarian people, they are no doubt the victims of the present\r\nsituation, but so they will remain. Unquestionably they possess some\r\nsterling qualities. They are industrious, energetic, and sober. But\r\nthey resemble the Prussians in many points, as the new German minister\r\nto Sofia announced recently (see _Le Temps_, 18th March, 1916). In\r\nfact the Bulgarian people has the keen eye to the main chance, the\r\nduplicity, and the domineering spirit of the Brandenburgs. Moreover, the\r\nBulgarian people is the prey of the Bulgarian politicians, who, with\r\nthe stubbornness of mules and a doggedness of which it is impossible\r\nto convey an idea, are perfectly irreconcilable on the question of\r\nMacedonia. No doubt the most astute among them might very well, as in\r\n1915, pretend to negotiate with the Allies for the purpose of delaying\r\nthe attack from the side of Salonika, of which Berlin is extremely\r\nafraid; but to believe it possible to come to a sincere and durable\r\nunderstanding with Bulgaria is merely to nurse the most pernicious of\r\nchimeras. To conclude a premature peace with Bulgaria would also entail\r\non the Allies other fatal consequences, which it is easy to demonstrate.\r\nA treaty with the Bulgarians, who in complicity with the Germans have\r\njust massacred systematically an enormous number of Serbians, would be\r\na manifest act of treason to Serbia; it would be to treat the crimes of\r\nthe Bulgarians as if they actually conferred rights on the criminals.\r\nClearly the public opinion of the Allied nations would never tolerate\r\nsuch an infamy. Besides, from a military point of view the calculation\r\nwould be wrong. In order to avoid giving battle to 350,000 Bulgarians,\r\nwhose forces must be divided between the Roumanian front and the Salonika\r\nfront, the Allies would be obliged, in the first place, to dispense\r\nwith the assistance of 150,000 Serbian soldiers, who obviously would\r\nrefuse to march the day that the Allies entered into negotiations with\r\nthe Bulgarians. Moreover, an understanding with Bulgaria would have the\r\neffect, at once political and military, of undermining the favourable\r\ndisposition of the Greeks and Roumanians towards the Entente. As I have\r\nshown in Chapter VII, the hatred of the Roumanians and the Greeks for the\r\nBulgarians is the great psychological factor in the Balkans.\r\n\r\nThe official plan of Bulgarian supremacy, set forth on the accompanying\r\nmap, may serve to explain that hatred, for it shows that Bulgarian\r\nambition encroaches considerably on the territories of all her\r\nneighbours. It now even extends by way of Albania to the Adriatic. We can\r\ntherefore readily understand that this plan of Bulgarian supremacy is the\r\nnightmare of the Greeks and the Roumanians. But these Bulgarians, like\r\nthe Prussians, because of the similarity of their characters, will never\r\nrenounce their programme of dominion until they shall have received at\r\nthe hands of the Allies, with the help of the Greeks and Roumanians, the\r\nsound thrashing which they have earned a hundred times over, and which\r\nis essential to the establishment of lasting peace in the Balkans. But\r\nit is clear that if negotiations were opened for a separate peace with\r\nthe Bulgarians, the Greeks (250,000 men) and the Roumanians (600,000\r\nmen), seeing their interests once more misunderstood by the Allies, would\r\nrefuse once and for all to fight on their side.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENCROACHMENTS PLANNED BY BULGARIA ON NEIGHBOURING STATES.]\r\n\r\nFinally, a separate peace which left Bulgaria in possession of her\r\nconquests, would enable her to build and buttress the bridge which is to\r\njoin the Central Empires to Turkey. That is just what Berlin wants in\r\norder to execute its scheme of domination “from Hamburg to the Persian\r\nGulf.” In the light of that aim, the secret attempts of Bulgaria to\r\nconclude a separate peace are seen to be the Bulgaro-German counterpart\r\nof the Turko-German manœuvre which I have exposed above (see p. 167).\r\n\r\nEvidently the Allies will not allow themselves to be taken in by these\r\nclumsy tricks. The lesson taught by the faults committed in the Balkans\r\nin 1915 is so plain that it will prevent the Allied leaders from\r\nperpetrating any fresh blunder on a large scale. Moreover, the victory of\r\nthe Allies cannot be won, and a lasting peace cannot be established in\r\nEurope, unless the German dodge of the “drawn game” is frustrated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE STILL NEUTRAL STATES WHOSE INDEPENDENCE WOULD BE DIRECTLY THREATENED\r\nBY THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE “HAMBURG TO THE PERSIAN GULF” SCHEME, AND\r\nTHEREFORE BY GERMANY’S CAPTURE OF AUSTRIA-HUNGARY.\r\n\r\n    I. The example of Portugal.\r\n\r\n    II. Holland.\r\n\r\n    III. Switzerland.\r\n\r\n    IV. The States of South America.\r\n\r\n    V. The United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmost all the neutral States, though as yet they are hardly aware of\r\nit, have a vital interest, not only in compelling Germany to abandon her\r\nconquests in the East and in the West, but also in preventing her from\r\nestablishing her supremacy over Austria-Hungary by means of the war.\r\nThis latter aim is perfectly logical, since the German supremacy over\r\nCentral Europe would secure for the government of Berlin formidable means\r\nof domination both by land and sea (see p. 106). One of the effects of\r\nthe colossal upheaval in the mutual relation of the forces of the States\r\ninvolved, in view of the abnormal concentration of the sources of power\r\nin German hands, would be that the independence of the neutral States\r\nwould inevitably be gravely imperilled. In this chapter we shall consider\r\nthe situation of countries still neutral, which would be particularly\r\naffected by the achievement of the scheme “from Hamburg to the Persian\r\nGulf.”\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nThe case of Portugal is typical, because here we have a small State\r\nwhich, in the opinion of many, seemed for a long time as if it could keep\r\nout of the conflict; whereas on the contrary the necessity of defending\r\nitself against the German schemes for swallowing it up, compelled it at\r\nlast to plunge into the war.\r\n\r\nEver since the opening of hostilities in Europe, Portugal has been\r\nthe scene of German intrigues carried on with the greatest activity;\r\nindeed, even before the outbreak of the European conflagration the\r\ntrain had been laid as carefully in Portugal as elsewhere. Working\r\nthrough reactionary centres, these intrigues ostensibly aimed at the\r\nrestoration to the throne of Emmanuel of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha-Bragança,\r\nwho had been dethroned, on October 5th, 1910, by the revolution which\r\ngave birth to the Portuguese Republic. Afterwards, on the 4th of\r\nSeptember, 1913, he married the German princess Augustine-Victoria, of\r\nHohenzollern Sigmaringen. The German agents also brought influence to\r\nbear on certain Portuguese anarchists in order, by every possible means,\r\nto stir up trouble in the country which had been marked out for ruin\r\nby the Pangerman plot of 1911. We have seen (p. 103) what Portuguese\r\ncolonies that plot had specially in view. Now in 1912 the government of\r\nBerlin, eagerly and astutely plotting its European war on the assumption\r\nthat England would stand out of it, and that she might be lulled into\r\nacquiescence by the bait of temporary colonial gains, availed itself of\r\nthe official negotiations with Lord Haldane to propose to the English\r\nCabinet that England and Germany should divide the Portuguese colonies in\r\nAfrica between them.\r\n\r\nThese colonies (the Azores, Madeira, Cape Verd, Princes Island, St.\r\nThomas, Guinea, Angola, Mozambique) shown on the accompanying map, are\r\nof great importance to Portugal. With their two millions of square\r\nkilometres, and their 8,300,000 inhabitants, they are the still\r\nimportant relics of the once magnificent colonial empire of Portugal;\r\nthey are accordingly an essential base for Portuguese commerce, and\r\nespecially for a future commercial revival of Portugal, which the\r\ngovernment of Lisbon is naturally anxious to promote.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PORTUGAL AND COLONIAL PANGERMANISM.]\r\n\r\nAt the very commencement of hostilities in Europe, the Germans,\r\ndiscounting their victory in Europe, invaded Angola, and it is only\r\nlately that the Portuguese soldiers succeeded in driving them out. Thus\r\nin point of fact a state of war has long existed between Portugal and\r\nGermany, and it is Germany that took the offensive. Hence from the outset\r\nthe Portuguese government has had many excellent reasons for wishing well\r\nto the cause of the Allies; and Portugal has effectively proved her good\r\nwill by all the means in her power.\r\n\r\nBy way of reprisals for the incessant German intrigues in Portugal\r\nitself, and for the acts of war committed on her colonial territory by\r\nthe soldiers of William II., Portugal at last seized the numerous German\r\nvessels which had been interned in her ports since the outbreak of the\r\nEuropean conflagration.\r\n\r\nGermany replied in March, 1915, by an official declaration of war, which\r\nin fact did nothing but legalize a state of things that had long existed\r\nin consequence of the German aggression on Angola.\r\n\r\nAfter this official rupture Portugal perfectly understood that, if she\r\nwished to save her very existence, she must range herself completely on\r\nthe side of the Allies. On March 25th, 1916, the Portuguese Minister of\r\nWar issued an order to the army, in which he said:\r\n\r\n“No one who has followed with patriotic anxiety the acts of Germany\r\never since the conference of Berlin in 1885, can doubt that her victory\r\nwould involve the loss of our colonies, perhaps even of our nationality.\r\nTherefore we must all impress it clearly on our minds, that the battles\r\nnow being fought in so many parts of the world touch us very closely;\r\nthat this war is our war, a war for our liberty, for our independence,\r\nfor the integrity of the territory of our native land, and that we should\r\nwage it wherever our forces can strike the heaviest blow at the power of\r\nGermany. The hatred of our barbarous foes, the Germans, should pervade\r\nevery heart, and that it may strike root and penetrate into the army,\r\nit is necessary to explain to the soldiers the reasons of the war, to\r\nenumerate the injuries that have been done us by the Germans, and to\r\nset forth clearly the intentions and schemes which Germany cherishes in\r\nregard to small nations, like Belgium, Serbia, and Portugal.”\r\n\r\nThis proclamation of the Portuguese Minister of War deserves to be\r\nremembered, for it accurately expresses the general sentiments which will\r\nbe shared more and more by States still neutral, in proportion as they\r\nunderstand more and more clearly that their future independence really\r\nhangs on the total defeat of Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nThe following words give a summary of the views and the tactics adopted\r\nby the Germans with regard to the Dutch in the Pangerman plan of 1895.\r\n\r\n“When our brothers of the Low German race shall have got over their\r\nalmost childish fright at ‘annexation by the Prussians,’ they will\r\nacknowledge that the admission of Holland into Great Germany is\r\nadvantageous to both parties. Moreover, in the bosom of Great Germany,\r\nthe Dutch would be able to preserve, to a reasonable extent, their own\r\nparticular characteristics.\r\n\r\n“The Kingdom of the Low Countries, on entering into not only the German\r\nCustoms Union but also the Pangerman Confederation, with the retention\r\nof all its rights, will cease to maintain an independent fleet, but\r\nwill organize an independent Army Corps, with privileges like those of\r\nBavaria, and also a colonial army. It will remain in possession of its\r\ncolonies, and might even undertake the administration of New Guinea and\r\nof all the German colonies in the Pacific.\r\n\r\n“The official language will remain Low German (Dutch) for the legislation\r\nand the administration in State, School, and Church. High German will\r\nnot be employed except in matters that concern the Confederation.\r\nBesides it is obvious that its use will spread rapidly, but voluntarily,\r\nin commerce and the sciences.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NEUTRAL STATES OF EUROPE AND PANGERMANISM.]\r\n\r\n“If the Rhine from its source to its mouth becomes a truly German river,\r\nit will then be the Low German (or Dutch) commercial towns and seaports\r\nnear its mouth, which will chiefly benefit thereby.\r\n\r\n“It will thus be seen that a singularly attractive prospect for the\r\neconomic and political future of the Low Countries, is being opened\r\nup, if they will only consent to become members of the Pangerman\r\nConfederation. God grant that our Low German cousins may at last abandon\r\nthat jealous regard for their independence as a separate State, which\r\nwe, the Germans of the Empire, also felt down to the years 1866 and\r\n1870” (see _Grossdeutschland und Mitteleuropa um das Jahr 1950_, p. 13,\r\nThormann und Goetsch, S.W. Bessel-Strasse 17, Berlin, 1895).\r\n\r\nSo it seems that twenty years ago the Germans trusted to moral suasion\r\nto open the eyes of the Dutch to the intrinsic beauties of Pangermany.\r\nThe hope was built on the familiar fact that many Dutchmen, addicted,\r\nlike their ancestors for ages before them, to the profitable occupation\r\nof foreign trade, devote their energies to the pursuit of gain, and have\r\nvery little time, and even less taste, for situations that call for\r\nbellicose resolutions. The same turn of mind explains why ever since\r\nthe outbreak of war the Germans have easily found in Holland plenty of\r\nenterprising firms, which have smuggled ample supplies of all sorts into\r\nGermany and snapped their fingers at the blockade.\r\n\r\nHowever, 1895 is a long time ago, and since then Pangerman ideas have\r\nmarched with the time. As we have seen (p. 103), the plan of 1911\r\nprovides for the “conveyance” of the Dutch colonies to Pangermany under\r\nconditions which would not allow the Low Countries to cherish the least\r\nillusion as to the ultimate preservation of their independence.\r\n\r\nBut the revelation of the German plans for the perpetration of burglary\r\nand the appropriation of other people’s goods, has had its effect, and\r\neven the Dutch, in spite of their intense desire not to be drawn into the\r\ngreat war, are now forced to look hard facts in the face.\r\n\r\nIn truth, the moral situation of the Dutch is hard, for they are\r\npulled in opposite directions by sentiments which logically lead to\r\ncontradictory decisions. On the one side, historical memories and ancient\r\nrivalries in the commerce of the sea still inspire them with a lively\r\ndread of England; on the other side, they are constrained to admit that\r\nthe Pangerman peril has grown imminent for their country. It is plain,\r\nin fact (see the map on p. 188) that if Germany were to tighten her grip\r\non Belgium, or if she emerged from the war much strengthened by the\r\nestablishment of her supremacy over Austria-Hungary, Holland would soon\r\ninevitably be forced, even in time of peace, to acquiesce in vassalage to\r\nher formidable neighbour, Pangermany.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch are all the more perplexed and irresolute, before they can\r\nscrew their courage up to the sticking point, because they are sometimes\r\ndisconcerted by the action of their government, which, as everybody\r\nknows, is open to both direct and powerful German influences. The\r\nsituation is described as follows in a few paragraphs of the _Telegraaf_,\r\nwhich earned for their author a series of prosecutions on the pretext\r\nthat they endangered the neutrality of the country:—\r\n\r\n“For our part,” said the _Telegraaf_, “we shall not cease to oppose a\r\nGovernment and its accomplice Press, who under the cloak of a ‘dignified\r\nneutrality’ are pursuing a rash policy of exportation and provisioning\r\nGermany with articles of prime necessity, thereby enabling that country\r\nto continue the war, and betraying not only the interests of their own\r\ncountry but also the cause of humanity” (quoted by _Le Temps_, 30th\r\nMarch, 1916).\r\n\r\nAs for the general and dominant tone of Dutch public opinion, Mr.\r\nHoldert, the editor of the _Telegraaf_, who is particularly well\r\nqualified to form an opinion on the subject, sums up as follows:\r\n\r\n“Every time an incident occurs that might lead Holland to take a grave\r\ndecision, before you venture to predict, remember that the people over\r\nthere do not want war. With us, business, money, gain, and all that sort\r\nof thing, is considered extremely, supremely, infinitely important.\r\n\r\n“To-day the majority of my fellow countrymen are rolling in money. Why\r\ntrouble about anything else?\r\n\r\n“Yes, eighty per cent. of the population are in favour of the Allies.\r\nFrance especially is loved, and she could ask but little of us which we\r\nwould not give. But that affection, though real, is so to speak, remote.\r\nWe quickly turn over the page which contains the news of the war” (see\r\n_Le Journal_, 5th April, 1916).\r\n\r\nThus Dutch opinion seems stagnant, yet it moves, though very, very\r\nslowly; for people are beginning to ask themselves whether, despite all\r\ntheir efforts, all their intense desire for peace, this dreadful war can\r\nend with the Dutch sword still in the scabbard.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the military measures taken by the Hague government have been\r\ndictated purely with the intention of defending Dutch neutrality. But\r\nfacts such as the torpedoeing of the _Tubantia_ go far to add to the\r\nnumber of those clearsighted and energetic patriots, who, like the\r\nadmirable and vigorous artist Raemaekers, acknowledge and proclaim that\r\nfor the sake of her honour as well as of her interest Holland is bound to\r\ndo all in her power to favour and hasten the victory of the Allies.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nThe Pangerman aims with regard to Switzerland, as set forth in the plan\r\nof 1895, are summed up as follows:—\r\n\r\n“We may then leave Switzerland to choose, whether she shall enter the\r\nGerman Customs Union and the Pangerman Confederation bringing all her\r\ncantons or only the German ones with her, or whether she shall form\r\npart of the German Empire on equal terms as a Federal State” (see\r\n_Grossdeutschland um das Jahr 1950_, p. 17).\r\n\r\nThe Pangerman programme is, therefore, definitely directed against\r\nSwitzerland (see the map on p. 188), but Berlin has always flattered\r\nitself with the hope of absorbing this little State, like Holland,\r\nwithout resort to force, simply in the course of nature and as a\r\nconsequence of the defeat of the great European powers.\r\n\r\nWhat is certain is that before the war the prestige of Germany in German\r\nSwitzerland was so great, and the organization of the German propaganda\r\nin this part of Helvetia was so perfect, that all the excuses published\r\nby the Berlin government to explain and justify the violation of Belgium\r\nwere swallowed without winking by the German Swiss.\r\n\r\nBut since then a slow change of sentiment has taken place. The enormous\r\nannexations contemplated by Germany, the atrocious manner in which she\r\nis waging the war, and, above all, the terrible horrors perpetrated\r\nin Serbia, have at last convinced an increasing number of Swiss that\r\na victory for Germany would create a formidable danger for the whole\r\ncivilized world in general, and for the independence of Switzerland in\r\nparticular.\r\n\r\nA gentleman at Zurich, whose position affords him ample opportunity for\r\nforming a just appreciation of the state of affairs, gave me recently the\r\nfollowing concise statement of the real feeling in German Switzerland:\r\n“The majority of the intellectuals, almost all of whom have studied in\r\nGermany, and a part of the business men, are the only resolute champions\r\nof Prussia. They would be quite willing to see Switzerland absorbed in\r\nPangermany. But the Swiss who hold that view are only a small minority.\r\nIn German Switzerland most of the manufacturers, almost all of whom have\r\nsuffered very heavily in recent years through the keenness of German\r\ncompetition, desire a German defeat, which would be in harmony both with\r\ntheir opinions as liberals and with their interests as manufacturers, by\r\nrelieving the strain of the present fierce competition in business. As\r\nfor the mass of the German Swiss—and that is the important point—they\r\nare by no means in love with the Prussians, as people in France wrongly\r\nimagine. They are before all things Swiss.”\r\n\r\nThe Swiss have resolved to defend their neutrality against the first of\r\ntheir neighbours that shall violate their frontier. The Allies wish for\r\nnothing more than that. They only desire that the Swiss should impress\r\nthis truth more and more clearly on their minds, that in presence of the\r\nformidable Pangerman ambition the victory of the Allies is a condition\r\nessential to the maintenance of the Helvetic Confederation.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying map summarizes and recalls the Pangerman claims to such\r\ndirect German protectorates in South America as were provided for by the\r\nplan of 1911 (see p. 105).\r\n\r\nIt is important to observe that the German designs on South America\r\nbegan just at the time when the European nations, acquiescing in the\r\nMonroe doctrine, renounced all intentions of appropriating any part of\r\nthe New World. This renunciation took place about 1898, the date of\r\nthe war between Spain and America. That was the very moment when the\r\nPangermanists of Berlin conceived and prepared to execute the plan of\r\nextending in the future the power of the Hohenzollerns to Cape Horn. This\r\nfact, taken in conjunction with many others, serves to demonstrate the\r\nspirit of conquest and aggression, the boundless ambition which animates\r\nthe Germany of William II.\r\n\r\nThe preparations for carrying out the Pangerman plans in South America\r\nwere, as everywhere else, conducted by the organizers of the movement\r\nmost methodically.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COLONIAL PANGERMANISM AND SOUTH AMERICA.]\r\n\r\nHaving thus settled on their plan of 1895, they proceeded to draw up\r\nan actual register of all the Germans existing on the face of the\r\nterrestrial globe, in order to pick out from them such as were likely to\r\nprove the most serviceable tools in executing the Pangerman scheme. The\r\ngeneral results of this register of Germans all over the world are to be\r\nfound, in a concentrated form, in the _Pangerman Atlas_ of Paul Langhans,\r\npublished by Justus Perthes at Gotha in 1900.\r\n\r\nSo far as relates to South America, this document proves that there were\r\n\r\n    In Peru        in 1890     2,000 Germans\r\n    In Paraguay    in 1890     3,000    ”\r\n    In Colombia    in 1890     3,000    ”\r\n    In Uruguay     in 1897     5,000    ”\r\n    In Venezuela   in 1894     5,000    ”\r\n    In Chili       in 1895    15,000    ”\r\n    In Argentina   in 1895    60,000    ”\r\n    In Brazil      in 1890   400,000    ”\r\n\r\nThese Germans have been strongly inoculated, especially since 1900, by\r\nthe Pangerman Societies. They have been organized with particular care\r\nin the countries which, like Argentina, and, above all, Brazil, were\r\nintended to be the principal German protectorates in South America.\r\n\r\nThe German law, called Delbrück’s law, of July 22nd, 1913, dealing with\r\nthe nationality of the Empire and the nationality of the State, has\r\ngreatly favoured the Pangerman organization in America. Hence it is\r\nneedful to be acquainted with at least the substance of the Delbrück\r\nlaw, since it formed the last stage, and a very significant one, in the\r\nPangerman organization all over the world before the outbreak of war.\r\n\r\nThe second part of article 25 of that law runs as follows:—“If any person\r\nbefore acquiring nationality in a foreign State, shall have received the\r\nwritten permission of a competent authority of his native State to retain\r\nhis nationality of that State, he shall not lose his nationality of the\r\nsaid native State. The German consul shall be consulted before granting\r\nthe said permission.”\r\n\r\nThese words afford us a measure of the depth of German astuteness.\r\nAccording to this provision, a German may become a naturalized subject\r\nof a foreign State, but if he obtains a written permission from the\r\ncompetent authorities of his native German State, _he continues, in\r\nspite of this naturalization, to enjoy, for himself and his descendants,\r\nall the rights of a German citizen and all the protection of the German\r\nEmpire_.\r\n\r\nThese provisions being contrary to all the general principles of\r\ninternational law on the subject of nationality, a German citizen who\r\nbenefits by them will take very good care not to acquaint the foreign\r\nState whose nationality he has acquired, with the highly peculiar\r\nsituation in which he stands. By this process Germany has been able to\r\nhave in every State agents devoted to her aggressive policy, without\r\nthese States being aware of the danger they run through this secret\r\nservice. In fact, these States had, to all appearance, to do only with\r\nfellow countrymen whom they had no right to suspect. It was only after\r\nmany months of war, when their criminal action compelled them to take\r\noff the mask, that the dangerous power of these Germans disguised as\r\nforeigners appeared in all its formidable and insufferable dimensions.\r\n\r\nThis state of things explains why, during the first months of the war,\r\nintoxicated by the powerful German propaganda, and ignorant of the\r\ndisasters with which Europe and still more themselves were threatened by\r\nthe Pangerman plot, the States of South America were unable to perceive\r\nthe peril at their door and to understand that they had a direct interest\r\nin the issue of the European war. But now public opinion in these\r\ncountries is advancing steadily towards a complete apprehension of the\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nPeru and Chili, one after the other, are slipping through the meshes of\r\nthe German net.\r\n\r\nIn Argentina the movement in favour of the Allies is also growing\r\nrapidly. But it is above all in Brazil, the southern part of which\r\nis most particularly coveted by the Germans, that the progress of\r\nenlightenment is especially interesting to watch. For a long time the\r\nGermans have concentrated their colonial efforts particularly on three\r\nBrazilian States, to wit, Parana (60,000 Germans), Santa Catarina\r\n(170,000), and Rio Grande do Sul (220,000). In these rich provinces, the\r\nGermans, preserving the language, the traditions, the prejudices of the\r\nFatherland, are almost absolute masters. Only 47,000 of them are openly\r\ncitizens of the German Empire; the rest, about 400,000, are apparently\r\nBrazilian subjects, but in virtue of the Delbrück law a considerable\r\npart of them have in reality remained or become once more liege-men of\r\nWilliam II. Moreover, the budget of the German Empire included a sum of\r\n500,000 marks to be devoted to the establishment or the support of German\r\nschools in Brazil. In 1912 Prince Henry of Prussia, brother of William\r\nII., in the course of his cruise, landed at the port of Itajahy to pay\r\na visit to his fellow countrymen in Santa Catarina. Since the outbreak\r\nof the European war the game of the Germans in Brazil has been gradually\r\nrevealed in its true colours, and it has been lately discovered that\r\nthe numerous Rifle Clubs were in fact societies for military drill and\r\ndangerous enough to necessitate their disarmament.\r\n\r\nIn the rest of Brazil, outside the three provinces mentioned above, the\r\nGermans are not numerous, but they fill most of the principal posts in\r\nbusiness houses and banks. In the first period of the war these Germans\r\nfounded Germanophile newspapers published in Portuguese, and thereby\r\nprevented Brazil from getting accurate information as to the origin and\r\ncourse of the conflict.\r\n\r\nBut despite this clever opposition, ever since the battle of the Marne\r\nthe cause of the Allies has been steadily gaining ground in Brazil. A\r\npowerful impulse to the movement has been given by the action of Portugal\r\nin taking up arms, for there are 600,000 Portuguese in Brazil.\r\n\r\nThus in South America the tide is clearly running in favour of the\r\nAllies. A new stage will be reached when these States come clearly to\r\nunderstand that in view of Pangerman colonial ambitions, which threaten\r\nthem personally, they have a direct interest in the complete victory of\r\nthe Allies, which alone can deliver them from the fear of the German\r\nperil. They will then reach the same definite and sound conclusion at\r\nwhich, as I shall show further on, the United States is logically bound\r\nto arrive.\r\n\r\nWhen that is so, it is possible, if not probable, that these South\r\nAmerican States, or at least the principal among them, will no longer be\r\nsatisfied to remain neutral. They will then acknowledge that a true view\r\nof their own interest compels them to strike, with all their might, a\r\nblow for the common freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nPresident Wilson, by his note to Berlin of April 20th, 1916, concerning\r\nsubmarine warfare, which had the character of an ultimatum, committed the\r\nUnited States to a first act of intervention in the European war. The\r\nfact that a consideration of their interests has compelled the Germans,\r\nat least for the moment, to bow to the mandate of the United States,\r\nseems to some people to have already closed the American intervention.\r\nThose who hold this opinion may support it by reference to the speech\r\nwhich President Wilson delivered to the Press Club at Washington, on May\r\n18th, 1916: “There are two reasons,” said the President, “why the chief\r\ndesire of the Americans is for peace. One is that they love peace, _and\r\nhave nothing to do with the present quarrel_; the other is that they\r\nbelieve that the parties to the quarrel have been forced to go to such\r\nlengths that they can no longer keep within the limits of responsibility.\r\nWhy not let the storm go by, and then, when all is over, make up the\r\naccount?” (quoted by _Le Temps_, May 22nd, 1916).\r\n\r\nThe need for reserve, which his official position lays on President\r\nWilson, has evidently hindered him from disclosing his thoughts fully;\r\nfor, as we shall see immediately, it would be particularly dangerous\r\nfor the United States to imagine that they have nothing to do with the\r\npresent quarrel, and to wait for the end of it in order to make up the\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nIn reality, the true question for the United States goes far beyond that\r\nof German piracy in submarine warfare. That question really involves\r\ntwo quite distinct American interests; one of a moral, the other of a\r\nmaterial or political nature.\r\n\r\nFrom the moral point of view the United States must consider the\r\nbarbarity with which Germany wages war, not only on the sea, but\r\neverywhere. Not only does she constantly violate the laws of war between\r\nbelligerents, but also and above all the German authorities subject to\r\na frightful reign of terror all the civil anti-Germanic populations in\r\nthe territories now occupied by Pangermany from the North Sea to Bagdad.\r\nThe sufferings inflicted by the Germans on the Belgians, the Slavs of\r\nAustria-Hungary, the Serbians, and the Armenians (whom they have caused\r\nto be massacred wholesale) amount to millions of indescribable pangs, of\r\nodious crimes, of atrocious martyrdoms. The Americans have intervened in\r\nthe submarine warfare in the name of humanity. Can they remain neutral\r\nin face of this “ocean of crimes” committed by the Germans, without the\r\nsmallest excuse, over enormous stretches of territory?\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of defending their own material interests, it\r\nis not certain that enough Americans even yet understand the magnitude\r\nof the formidable problem which the European war compels them to face\r\nand solve. It is quite natural that it should be so. In many circles\r\nof France and England it is only quite lately that people have come\r\nclearly to apprehend, as a whole, the real, the gigantic objects pursued\r\nby Germany in the war. Hence it is not surprising that the enormity of\r\nthe German plot has not yet been grasped by the Americans of the United\r\nStates, whose ideas about Europe at the beginning of the conflict were\r\nnecessarily just as vague as the ideas of Europeans about the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DISTRIBUTION OF GERMAN-BORN GERMANS IN THE UNITED\r\nSTATES.]\r\n\r\nThe accompanying map will enable the reader readily to appreciate the\r\nbasis of the real problem which the war presents to the United States. As\r\nI have explained (p. 194), the Germans set themselves after 1895 to make\r\na regular register of all the Germans scattered over the whole world. Our\r\nmap is drawn up in accordance with the data of map 5 in the _Pangerman\r\nAtlas_ of Paul Langhans, which gives the results of the register. The map\r\nshows what proportion the Germans, who had been born in Germany and had\r\nemigrated to the United States, bore to the American population about\r\nthe year 1890. We can see that the proportion was considerable, since at\r\nsome points (see the map) it amounted to 35%. Further, the general view\r\npresented by the map enables us to observe that in the United States\r\nthe Germans have planted themselves by preference in the industrial and\r\ncommercial regions of the East and of the Great Lakes. We can therefore\r\nunderstand what followed. Ever since 1900 the _Alldeutscher Verband_ or\r\nPangerman Union, in obedience to secret instructions from the official\r\nauthorities in Berlin, has laid itself out to select from this mass of\r\nGermans in the United States all such as might best serve the cause of\r\nPrussian militarism at any given moment, in the most diverse domains,\r\nas soon as the European conflagrations should have broken out. Hence\r\nfor the last twenty years most of the ten to fifteen million Americans\r\nof German origin have been organized. Little by little, in the midst of\r\nthe great American Republic, there has grown up a State within a State,\r\na State endowed with the most powerful means of influence. In point of\r\nfact, among the German-Americans there are manufacturers, merchants,\r\nand bankers of colossal fortunes, who control the lives of hundreds of\r\nthousands of workmen or employees living in dependence upon them. The\r\nGerman-Americans also own many newspapers and associations. They have\r\ntherefore been able to exert a considerable influence on the policy\r\nof the United States, and even to secure the election to Congress of\r\nmembers devoted to their interests. The Delbrück law (see p. 195) has\r\ncompleted the German organization in the United States, by enabling an\r\ninfluential party of German-Americans to preserve the appearance of\r\nAmerican citizens, while all the time they remain pledged heart and soul\r\nto forward the Kaiser’s scheme of universal slavery.\r\n\r\nAs the total population of the United States is 100 millions, it is\r\neasy to see what may be the power of 10 to 15 million German-Americans\r\nsystematically organized for a definite purpose, when these are opposed\r\nto 90 million Americans who, never suspecting the Pangerman peril, have\r\ntaken no kind of special precaution against their fellow citizens of\r\nGerman origin.\r\n\r\nThis very peculiar state of affairs explains the strange position\r\noccupied by the United States since the outbreak of the European War.\r\nFrom that time the German-Americans, in virtue of the immense means of\r\ninfluence and of action which they had prepared beforehand, have carried\r\non a multifarious campaign, with extraordinary audacity in furtherance of\r\nthe German game. Thus the German Ambassador, Count Bernstorff, and his\r\nmilitary attachés von Papen, Boy-Ed, etc., have aided and abetted in the\r\ntask of subverting the United States by a multitude of German-American\r\nspies and agents.\r\n\r\nDuring the first months of the war the German propaganda, carried on with\r\nextraordinary activity, was easily able to deceive a considerable part\r\nof American opinion as to the true origin of, and the responsibility\r\nfor, the carnage going on in Europe. Afterwards, when the war dragged\r\non, and the Allies placed considerable orders in the United States,\r\nthe understrappers of the professional German spies engaged in an\r\nextraordinary series of outrages in order to terrorize the American\r\nworkmen employed in executing the orders of the Allies. The object of\r\nthese acts of violence, combined with the frivolous and interminable\r\ndiscussions which Count Bernstorff carried on with the Government of\r\nWashington, was first to induce the United States to issue an order\r\nprohibiting the Allies from arming their merchant ships for the purpose\r\nof self-defence against the German submarines; second, to persuade the\r\nAmericans that the blockade of Germany by England was maintained in a\r\nmanner contrary to the rules of international law; third, to slacken\r\nor stop the production of munitions of war destined for the Allies;\r\nand lastly, _supposing that the principal acquisitions contemplated by\r\nPangermany had been effected in Europe_, to induce President Wilson\r\nto intervene in favour of peace under colour of putting an end to the\r\nEuropean butchery—an intervention which, if it took place, would have the\r\npractical result of opening the negotiations for peace under conditions\r\neminently favourable to the German plans of annexation.\r\n\r\nBut at last the crimes of violence committed by the Germans in the United\r\nStates opened the eyes of the American people and roused them to anger.\r\nWe must understand that it was only gradually, and in spite of great\r\ndifficulties, that the real citizens of the United States, hemmed in by\r\nthe German organization as by a ring fence, were able to acquire true\r\nnotions as to the European war. This progress of American opinion was\r\nfurther retarded by the circumstance that before the war, for various\r\nreasons, the Allied countries unquestionably occupied a much lower place\r\nin the esteem of the United States than Germany, which had gained for\r\nherself very great prestige by her extraordinary activity in commerce,\r\nindustry, and science.\r\n\r\nAs to Russia, the Americans knew scarcely anything about it except the\r\nhardships of which the Jews in that country complained. As many of\r\nthese people have emigrated to the United States, and there exercise\r\na great influence on the press, they have naturally fostered anything\r\nbut a sympathy for the Empire of the Tsars. The Irish-Americans devoted\r\nthemselves to the similar task of blackening England, from which the\r\nUnited States had in days gone by to extort her independence. As to\r\nFrance, the Americans, on the faith of superficial observations,\r\nconsidered her to be in a state of hopeless decadence. The flagrant\r\natrocity of the prodigious German crimes committed in the United States;\r\non the high seas against neutral passengers; in Belgium against the\r\nBelgians; in Serbia against the Serbians; in Armenia against the\r\nArmenians; and, on the other hand, the magnificent resistance of the\r\nAllies, these things have at last produced a revulsion of feeling. The\r\nprejudices of the Americans against Russia and England have been to a\r\ngreat extent mitigated, and the grand, the noble attitude of the people\r\nof France, the tenacity and the heroism of her soldiers, have proved\r\nthat France is far indeed from decadent. To-day we may say, for it is\r\nthe truth, that France has won the deep and enthusiastic admiration of\r\nall the really independent American citizens of the United States. This\r\nprogressive change of opinion has ranged the Americans more and more on\r\nthe side of the Allies.\r\n\r\nBut American opinion has still one stage to travel. It is this. The\r\nAmerican people must understand with the utmost clearness that the\r\nvictory of Germany would unquestionably mean the end of the independence\r\nof the United States. Indeed, some Americans, more clearsighted than the\r\nrest, have already travelled this last stage on the road to truth. In\r\nMarch, 1916, Dr. Elliot, formerly President of Harvard University, and an\r\nintimate friend, we are told, of President Wilson, declared in the _New\r\nYork Times_: “_The quickest, the best, the surest means for Americans to\r\ndefend themselves against a German invasion is to conclude with France\r\nand England a permanent alliance, offensive and defensive, having for\r\nits aim the maintenance of the freedom of the seas for the Allies, and\r\nresistance to any maritime attack. It is time for all Americans to take\r\nsides openly with the European peoples who for so many long months have\r\nbeen standing up against the military despotism of Prussia._” (Quoted by\r\n_Le Temps_, 15th March, 1916.)\r\n\r\nDr. Elliot has thus stated in terms as exact as they are complete the\r\nreal problem which the Americans have to solve. Clearly it reached far\r\nbeyond the controversies about the submarine warfare. It is not enough,\r\nindeed, for the Americans to constitute themselves the champions of right\r\nand justice against Teutonic barbarity; _they must understand that the\r\nmaintenance of the independence of the United States absolutely depends\r\non the complete victory of the Allies in Europe_. Already many Americans\r\ncome near to accepting this view. Thus at Carnegie Hall, New York, at the\r\nend of May, 1916, Major Putnam, addressing 3000 members of the “Committee\r\nof American Rights,” excited great enthusiasm by demanding that America\r\nshould at once take part in the war on the side of the Allies. His chief\r\nargument was: “If Germany wins in this war, her next aggression will be\r\nagainst our Republic.” (Quoted by _Le Temps_, May 22nd, 1916.)\r\n\r\nBut these clear ideas, involving immediate and decisive action, are as\r\nyet shared only by a minority of Americans, better informed than the rest.\r\n\r\nThe progress of American opinion in general will be complete when from a\r\ngeneral view of the facts of the war, as these have occurred in America\r\nas well as in Europe, the people shall logically infer the formidable\r\nconsequences which a German victory would entail on the United States.\r\n\r\nThat general view, which the great American Republic will probably\r\ntake in time, is as follows. It will necessarily be based on an exact\r\nknowledge of the German plan for dealing with the United States, a plan,\r\nby the way, which is of long standing.\r\n\r\nIn 1898, before Manilla, the German Rear-Admiral von Goetzen, a friend of\r\nthe Kaiser, said to the American Admiral Dewey: “In about fifteen years\r\nmy country will begin a great war.... Some months after we have done our\r\nbusiness in Europe we shall take New York and probably Washington, and we\r\nshall keep them for a time. We do not intend to take any territory from\r\nyou, but only to put your country in its proper place with reference to\r\nGermany. We shall extract one or two billions of dollars from New York\r\nand other towns.” (See _Naval and Military Record_, quoted by _L’Echo\r\nde Paris_, September 24th, 1915.) These words at the time were regarded\r\nas mere gasconade. But now it is indisputable that even before 1898 the\r\nGermans of Berlin had, by means of the processes described above (p.\r\n200), been systematically laying the foundations of a State within the\r\nUnited States, a State that has long been silently sapping the ground on\r\nwhich stands the American Republic.\r\n\r\nA multitude of recent and striking facts—pressure brought to bear on\r\npoliticians, monster strikes, plots and outrages against public order\r\nexecuted by order of the official agents of the Kaiser, such as von\r\nPapen, Boy-Ed, von Igel, &c—have abundantly demonstrated that the German\r\norganization in America threatens the independence of the United States,\r\nand is of a definitely criminal and treasonable character. A phrase in a\r\nletter of Baron de Meysenburg, German consul at New Orleans, written on\r\nDecember 4th, 1915, to von Papen, German military attaché at Washington,\r\nwho organized the principal outrages in the United States, proves that\r\nin the minds of Germans behind the scenes the turn of the United States\r\nwas to come in due course. The latter was lately seized by the English:\r\n“May the day of the settling of accounts come here also, and when that\r\nday comes may our Government have found again that will of iron without\r\nwhich no impression can be made on this country.” (Quoted by _Le Temps_,\r\nJanuary 17th, 1916.)\r\n\r\nOn the other hand the Americans cannot shut their eyes to the extreme\r\ngravity of the recent Pangerman manœuvres in the States of South\r\nAmerica, particularly in Argentina and Brazil, which are regarded as\r\ndestined ultimately to become German protectorates; also in Nicaragua,\r\nwhere the Kaiser’s agents have tried to get a concession of territory for\r\nthe construction of a canal to compete with the Panama canal. Lastly,\r\nthere is the undeniable fact, which brings the danger still nearer home,\r\nthat a few months ago Germany plotted the military invasion of Canada,\r\nwith the complicity of her subjects disguised as American citizens.\r\nCommon sense, therefore, tells us that, assuming that the Allies were\r\nbeaten in Europe, Germany would be the mistress of Canada, and would\r\npractically dominate the United States. The extraordinary series of\r\nformidable outrages which the German-Americans have already concocted and\r\nexecuted on the soil of the great American Republic, is proof patent that\r\nthe existence of Pangermany would be incompatible with the independence\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nAll that is more or less clearly understood in the United States; but\r\nwhat American opinion still needs to be enlightened on is the immense\r\ndanger which the United States would incur through the formidable Berlin\r\ntrap called “the Drawn Game,” the most dangerous trick which the Germans\r\nstill keep up their sleeve. Seeing that many of the Allies do not yet\r\nunderstand the enormous peril of a Germany yielding temporarily on the\r\nEast and on the West in order to make herself mistress once and for all\r\nof Central Europe, the Balkans, and Turkey, it is natural enough that the\r\nAmericans should not yet have fully “realized” the vast bearings of the\r\ndodge called “the Drawn Game.”\r\n\r\nThe map on p. 101 enables the reader to see what would be the great\r\ndanger from the American point of view. As I have explained in Chapter V,\r\nthe pretended “Drawn Game” would enable Germany to carry out her scheme\r\nof domination “from Hamburg to the Persian Gulf,” and would thereby\r\nsecure for Berlin the means of laying hands successively on all the\r\nimportant strategical points which command the seas of the whole world.\r\nThe consequence for the United States would be that with the keys of all\r\nthe seas in her hand, Germany would be able to prosecute her intrigues\r\non a much greater scale in South America, Canada, and therefore in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nIt is deeply to be regretted that the very distinguished American Admiral\r\nMahan is no more. If I may judge by his powerful book, _The Interest\r\nof America in Sea Power Present and Future_, the tenor of which was\r\nadmirably expounded by M. Jean Izoulet some time ago, I believe that I\r\nam not going too far when I affirm that were Admiral Mahan now alive he\r\nwould, on a review of the whole situation, sketch as follows the line of\r\nconduct which the government of Washington ought to follow with reference\r\nto the European war. Admiral Mahan would doubtless tell his countrymen:\r\n“At no price, under no pretext, should the United States suffer Germany\r\nto execute her project from Hamburg to the Persian Gulf, and that because\r\nof the consequences which the achievement of that plan would entail on\r\nsea power all over the world. As the only sure guarantee against the\r\naccomplishment of that plan is to be found in Central Europe (see p.\r\n129), the United States has a direct and first-hand interest in solving\r\nthe question of Austria-Hungary on the basis of nationalities, that\r\nsolution being over and above indispensable if the world is to see the\r\nend of the Pangerman peril and of the great armaments.”\r\n\r\nHence, taking everything into account, we conclude that, apart from any\r\nquestion of humanity and justice, the United States have an absolutely\r\nvital interest, not only in a partial victory of the Allies in Europe,\r\nbut in their complete victory. It is desirable that this truth should be\r\nadmitted as soon as possible, for then the measures, which the Government\r\nof Washington could not fail to take, would signally hasten the end of\r\nthe European carnage.\r\n\r\nPlain good sense suffices to forecast what these measures would be.\r\n\r\nIt is as clear as daylight that the expedition to Mexico is a German\r\ntrap; hence the United States have every reason for awaiting the end\r\nof the European war before committing themselves further in that\r\ndirection. On the other hand, _now that the Allies have gripped Germany\r\nby the throat, the Government of Washington should avail itself of this\r\nexceptional opportunity for carrying out with the utmost speed the\r\ndestruction of that criminal and parasitic organization which the Germans\r\nhave contrived to plant in the soil of the United States_. To arrest\r\nthe ringleaders who have been guilty of inciting to treason and crimes\r\nagainst the common law, _whatever their social position or wealth may\r\nbe_; to suppress the associations which are nothing but agencies of the\r\nBerlin government—these are tasks which the Americans have every motive\r\nfor accomplishing without delay.\r\n\r\nObviously, too, when the United States shall have wakened up to the\r\ntruth, they will acknowledge it to be at once their interest and\r\ntheir duty to give the Allies all material succour, since nothing but\r\ntheir complete victory over Germany can safeguard for the future the\r\nindependence of the United States.\r\n\r\nIn the financial sphere the United States can offer the Allies immense\r\nfacilities for raising loans, which would be particularly opportune.\r\n\r\nMr. Guthrie, Vice-President of the French-American Committee at New York,\r\nhas explained as follows the method, at once delicate and ingenious,\r\nwhereby the United States could and should, according to him, give their\r\nfinancial support to France. “The historian Perkins,” says Mr. Guthrie,\r\n“states that the expenses incurred by France in liberating America\r\namounted to 772 million dollars. Of this enormous outlay, which ruined\r\nthe Royal Treasury, not a stiver was ever repaid to France. She never\r\nclaimed it, and to-day she would proudly refuse to be repaid, reminding\r\nus that, in the treaty of alliance of 6th February, 1778, she stipulated\r\nthat she should receive no indemnity for her help and her sacrifices....\r\nThe generosity of that treaty was unprecedented in the history of the\r\nworld.... Would it not be supremely just if the American people, a\r\nhundred and thirty-four years after the battle of Yorktown, recognized\r\nthat service—I will not call it debt—by offering the French people\r\ncommercial credit to the amount of the principal, that is to say 772\r\nmillion dollars, to be repaid at France’s convenience? It would be only\r\nthe equivalent of a contribution of seven and a half dollars from each\r\ncitizen of the United States, much less than the tax that was voluntarily\r\nand cheerfully paid by the French people to help us in the eighteenth\r\ncentury. Would it not be noble and glorious, honourable alike to head and\r\nheart, if the great American bankers could have proclaimed to the world\r\nthat they had fixed the figure at 772 million dollars in gratitude for\r\nthe past?” (see _Revue du XVIII. siècle_, janvier-avril, 1916).\r\n\r\nIn the matter of munitions of war the United States might evidently\r\nincrease her production. Lastly, as has been said already, the United\r\nStates would be in a position to furnish the Allies with men, since\r\nthis unprecedented war requires such vast numbers of soldiers. But,\r\nas we know, the United States have not got a large army, and it is\r\nnot certain that they either would or could rapidly improvise one. A\r\nmuch simpler solution might enable the United States to furnish a very\r\nconsiderable body of men to the Allies. This could be effected if the\r\nGovernment of Washington were to grant leave to American citizens to\r\nenlist as volunteers in the Allied armies, on such terms as might be\r\nagreed upon. Not only would English-speaking Americans be glad to come\r\nand fight the Teutonic barbarians, but—and this is a fact not generally\r\nknown—there are among American citizens millions of Slavs who emigrated\r\nformerly from Austria-Hungary and the Balkans. These American Slavs are\r\nardent partisans of the Allies, and many a time in the last few months\r\nthese men, working in the American munition factories, have frustrated\r\nthe German attempts at outrages. Probably hundreds of thousands of\r\nthese Slavs would gladly come as volunteers to fight in Europe for the\r\nliberation of Austria-Hungary and the Balkans, their native land, which\r\nthey quitted as exiles long ago to escape the German-Magyar yoke. We see\r\nthen that by such voluntary enlistments the United States could very soon\r\ncontribute troops for the conflict in Europe without laying on its own\r\nshoulders the enormous burden of creating a great army.\r\n\r\nSuccours of these various sorts, furnished by America, would evidently\r\nhasten the course of events. We may reasonably treat them as possible,\r\nsince it is certain that a German victory would put the independence of\r\nthe United States in jeopardy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS.\r\n\r\nWHAT HAS BEEN SET FORTH IN THE PRECEDING NINE CHAPTERS APPEARS TO JUSTIFY\r\nTHE FOLLOWING CONCLUSIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n_The temporary achievement of nine-tenths of the Pangerman plan in\r\naccordance with the programme of 1911 serves to refute the lies\r\ndisseminated by the German propaganda as to the cause and authors of the\r\nwar._\r\n\r\nThe intellectual mobilization of Germany, as powerfully organized and\r\ncarried out as her military organization, has enabled her utterly to\r\ndeceive many neutrals in the world as to the responsibilities for the\r\noutbreak and prolongation of the war. The Allies do not yet fully\r\nunderstand how prejudicial to them this German propaganda has been, and\r\nwhat dangers it still involves for the conduct of the struggle and the\r\nconclusion of peace.\r\n\r\nThis German propaganda has been all the more successful because for\r\na very long time it encountered no serious opposition on the side of\r\nthe Allies. For they, ingenuously confident in the justice of their\r\ncause, which seemed to them self-evident, have not attempted any real\r\nintellectual mobilization. Only quite lately have the Allies begun to\r\norganize the propaganda which must and ought to be carried on in foreign\r\ncountries; substantial progress may be anticipated in this direction.\r\n\r\nSix main arguments have been employed to back the German propaganda.\r\n\r\n1º. Germany has been forced to wage the war in order to resist a\r\ncoalition treacherously contrived by England. Therefore Germany, a\r\ncountry of intellectual, scientific, and economic activity, obliged to\r\nright for its existence, deserves the sympathies of the whole world.\r\n\r\n2º. If the neutrals are seriously injured by the war and its prolongation\r\nthe responsibility rests on the Allies, who desire to destroy the German\r\npeople. The neutrals should therefore take common action and bring\r\npressure to bear on the Allies for the purpose of inducing them to\r\nacquiesce in the German victory, thus ensuring the speedy restoration of\r\npeace.\r\n\r\n3º. To hasten this result the neutrals, and especially the United States,\r\nought to oppose the maritime blockade which England is maintaining,\r\nunder conditions the legitimacy of which, from the point of view of\r\ninternational law, is open to question. By refusing to supply munitions\r\nto the Allies, the United States would put an end to the butchery and\r\nthus serve the cause of humanity.\r\n\r\n4º. Germany is really conciliatory, she wants nothing but an equitable\r\npeace. “We Germans,” declared Herr von Bethmann-Hollweg, December 11th,\r\n1915, “do not wish to set the peoples by the ears; on the contrary each\r\nwill bear his share in the peaceful labour of all and in the progress of\r\nthe nations.”\r\n\r\n5º. The neutrals ought all the more to help Germany because she is\r\nfighting to ensure for all the freedom of the seas, which at present\r\nhateful England keeps in her own hands. The _Berliner Tageblatt_ (quoted\r\nby _Le Matin_ of February 18th, 1916), did not scruple to assert that\r\nthe achievement by Germany of her favourite scheme “from Hamburg to the\r\nPersian Gulf” would secure for all nations the freedom of the sea. “If\r\nthe economic mission of Germany,” said that journal, “is to guard the\r\nfreedom of the road which leads from the North Sea through Central Europe\r\nto Asia Minor, and to render it more and more accessible, in the interest\r\nof all who reside along the road in question, then it is a necessary\r\nconsequence of this our mission that we should have a vital interest in\r\nthe sea likewise, since the Continental road in Central Europe is merely\r\nits continuation. Our interest requires that the sea shall be freed from\r\nthe supremacy of a single people, that it shall be open to all honest\r\ncompetition.”\r\n\r\n6º. The Allies pretended that they made war on Germany because we\r\nviolated the neutrality of Belgium. This cant only serves as a cloak for\r\ntheir own hypocritical cupidity. It is not for the Allies to reproach\r\nGermany, seeing that they have themselves violated the neutrality of\r\nGreece.\r\n\r\nTo the Allies, who can have no doubt as to the premeditated character\r\nof the German aggression, these main arguments, on which the German\r\npropaganda rests, of course, are nothing more nor less than “colossal”\r\nlies, as absurd as they are cynical. Nevertheless we must bear in mind\r\nthat repeated indefatigably under every form to Germanophile neutrals in\r\nEurope or to neutrals in America and Asia, who naturally have but vague\r\nideas on the complex affairs of Europe, they have enabled the Germans\r\ngravely to prejudice the cause of the Allies through the moral, economic,\r\nand military effects which they have produced. Hence the Allies are\r\ndeeply concerned in frustrating the world-wide German propaganda with\r\nall possible speed. Now that great object, as we shall see later on,\r\nthe Allied Governments could, if they chose, very quickly accomplish by\r\npointing to the temporary success of the Pangerman plot.\r\n\r\nPangermanism and the dangers which it involves for the future are now\r\nwell enough known in some neutral countries, but the knowledge is still\r\nsomewhat vague, it still lacks that clear definition and that sense of\r\nimminent peril which arouse strong convictions and prompt actions. But\r\nif the Pangerman plan of 1911, in all its definiteness and extent, has\r\nbeen ignored down to a very recent date in the Allied countries, which\r\nnevertheless above all others are interested in knowing it, we can easily\r\nunderstand that this nefarious plot for enslaving the whole world has\r\nnot yet been fully apprehended by neutral nations. But the temporary\r\naccomplishment of the Pangerman plan in Europe, to the enormous extent\r\nof nine-tenths, furnishes the Allies with demonstrative arguments of the\r\nutmost cogency, and thus puts it in their power speedily to counteract\r\nthe effect of the German lies all over the world, and to prove the danger\r\nwhich Pangermanism creates for all civilized States.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this object it would be enough if the Allied propaganda, which\r\nhas begun to be organized, were to be co-ordinated and founded on a small\r\nnumber of positive arguments drawn from the results already attained\r\nby Pangermanism; for these results would reveal to everybody Germany’s\r\nlong premeditation, and therefore her responsibility and the scheme of\r\nworld-wide domination which she pursues.\r\n\r\nThis Allied propaganda ought to be firmly established by the practical\r\nand indisputable proof afforded by the geographical superposition of the\r\n1911 plan on the territories actually taken possession of by Germany in\r\nthe course of the war; thus compared, it will be seen that the plan and\r\nits execution tally almost exactly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RELATION BETWEEN THE PANGERMAN PLAN OF 1911 AND THE\r\nPANGERMAN GAINS AT THE BEGINNING OF 1916.]\r\n\r\nThe accompanying map exhibits this incontestable truth in a graphic\r\nform by showing the outlines of the actual German fortress compared\r\nwith the outlines contemplated by the 1911 plan. According to it the\r\nGerman conquests were to have extended to 3,474,288 square kilometres,\r\nin addition to Germany itself. But these conquests and seizures at the\r\nbeginning of 1916 were accomplished over an area of 3,035,572 square\r\nkilometres. This geographical proof is confirmed by many manifestoes\r\nwhich have appeared on the other side of the Rhine advocating a policy of\r\nannexation. Amongst these may particularly be noted:—\r\n\r\n1º. The famous memorial of May 20th, 1915, which the Imperial Chancellor\r\ncaused to be presented to himself by the most important associations of\r\nGermany (see p. 17).\r\n\r\n2º. Germany’s manifest desire to get possession successively of Riga,\r\nCalais, Verdun, Belfort, and Salonika, in order to complete the plan of\r\n1911 by holding the strategical points necessary for the preservation of\r\nthe territories over which she has cast her net.\r\n\r\n3º. The declarations made in the Reichstag on April 5th, 1916, by the\r\nImperial Chancellor, Herr von Bethmann-Hollweg, which lend the force of\r\ndemonstration to the geographical proof.\r\n\r\nTo any plain man these declarations appear to amount to an official\r\navowal of Germany’s intention to execute the Pangerman plan. The phrases\r\nof the Imperial Chancellor leave no room for ambiguity.\r\n\r\n“After the war Poland will no longer be the Poland out of which the\r\nRussian usurers have been cleared.... No. Never again must Russia be able\r\nto march her armies to the defenceless frontier of East Prussia, nay,\r\nof West Prussia (_thunders of applause_). Just as little is it to be\r\nsupposed that in the West we shall give up the lands where our people’s\r\nblood has flowed, unless we receive solid guarantees for the future. We\r\nmean to create solid guarantees in order that Belgium should not become a\r\nvassal State of England and France, that it should not be turned into an\r\noutwork against Germany from the military as well as the economic point\r\nof view.” (_Loud applause._) (Quoted by _Le Temps_, April 8th, 1916.)\r\n\r\nThe Imperial Chancellor could not assert more categorically the\r\nterritorial claims of Germany on the East and on the West. As for the\r\nclaims towards the South and South-East, consequent upon Germany’s\r\nseizure of Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, Serbia, and Turkey, Herr von\r\nBethmann-Hollweg made no allusion to them. His silence is intelligible.\r\nIn the first place, it was too much to expect that the Imperial\r\nChancellor should make a clean breast of the burglaries which Germany\r\nhas committed on the territories of her own Allies; in the second place,\r\nBerlin affects to consider these forcible acquisitions to the South and\r\nSouth-East as permanent and therefore beyond the reach of discussion.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Deputy Spahn, leader of the Centre, who on April 5th, 1914, and\r\nagain on December 11th, 1915, took on himself to reply to the Chancellor\r\nand to say outright what the exigencies of office obliged that gentleman\r\nonly to hint at, left no doubt as to Germany’s intentions with regard to\r\nCentral Europe. “We must,” said Herr Spahn, “bring about a lasting union\r\nwith Austria-Hungary. We must have at our command territories larger than\r\nthe German Empire. This war, which has been forced upon us, must secure\r\nfor us a position of world-wide power.” (See _Le Temps_, April 7th, 1916.)\r\n\r\nThus irrefragable proofs, both material and moral, combine to\r\ndemonstrate, beyond a shadow of doubt, that Germany made and continues to\r\nwage the war for the purpose of carrying out the Pangerman plan which she\r\nelaborated from 1895 to 1911.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n_Nine-tenths of the Pangerman plan of 1911 having been for the moment\r\nachieved, the Allies can avail themselves of this fact as evidence to\r\ncounteract speedily and everywhere, the effects of the German propaganda,\r\nand to prove to the civilized world the legitimacy and the necessity of\r\ntheir military action against Prussianized Germany._\r\n\r\nStarting from the practical proofs and the German declarations, both of\r\nthem indisputable, which we have just set forth, the propaganda of the\r\nAllies should be able speedily to demonstrate to neutrals the absolute\r\nfalsehood of the German allegations. Hence it should prove that:\r\n\r\n1º. Germany made the war, after very long premeditation, solely for the\r\nsake of executing the Pangerman plan of 1895-1911, the aim of which is\r\nto effect formidable conquests and to subject in Europe and Turkey 127\r\nmillions of non-Germans to the yoke of 77 millions of Germans (see p. 15).\r\n\r\n2º. If the war is prolonged, it is only because Germany has not renounced\r\nher plan of universal domination.\r\n\r\n3º. In claiming to carry out her scheme “from Hamburg to the Persian\r\nGulf,” Germany by no means aims at securing for the world that freedom\r\nof the seas which, according to her, has been usurped by England; on the\r\ncontrary, the intention of the Berlin government is, by means of the\r\ninevitable consequences of the “Hamburg to the Persian Gulf” scheme, to\r\nget possession of all the strategical points necessary to ensure the\r\ncommand of the sea all over the world (see p. 106).\r\n\r\n4º. In virtue of these consequences, the accomplishment of the “Hamburg\r\nto the Persian Gulf” scheme would directly threaten the independence of\r\nall the civilized States in the world, especially of Japan, the States of\r\nSouth America, and the United States.\r\n\r\n5º. No comparison is possible between the violation of Belgian neutrality\r\nby Germany and the Allies’ occupation of Salonika.\r\n\r\nThe Allies did not go to Greece to take possession of the country, as\r\nthe Germans did to Belgium. The Allies went to Greece to assist their\r\nally Serbia, which, moreover, was the ally of Greece, and to oppose the\r\nspoliation of Austria-Hungary, the Balkans, and Turkey, by Germany.\r\nThe treaties which give Turkey, France, England, and Russia the right\r\nof protecting the Hellenic constitution, greatly endangered by German\r\ninfluences at Athens, are sufficient to justify, on the ground of\r\ninternational law, the presence of the Allies in Greece. But it is\r\nnecessary, further, to state clearly that they are there in virtue of a\r\nstill higher right, that of safeguarding the collective liberty of the\r\nnations. A comparison will enable us to appreciate this point of view,\r\nthe statement of which is perhaps novel. According to the civil law,\r\nprivate property is inviolable. But if any man, passing a garden which\r\nthe right of private property forbids him to enter, sees on the other\r\nside of the garden a ruffian in the act of murdering a person for the\r\npurpose of robbing him, he not only has a moral right, but is in duty\r\nbound to cross the garden to help his fellow who is in danger of his\r\nlife. There is not a court of justice in the world that would blame the\r\nworthy and courageous citizen for having violated the rights of private\r\nproperty in succouring his fellow man. But the Allies went to Salonika\r\nwith exactly the same intention. They have passed through Greece in order\r\nto seize by the throat the Pangerman ruffian who is violently robbing\r\nAustria-Hungary, the Balkans, and Turkey; who is destroying by millions\r\nin these countries the Antigermanic civil populations; who, shrinking\r\nfrom no crimes, however heinous, claims to lay hands on riches untold,\r\nand to secure his illgotten gains by capturing the whole region from\r\nVienna to the Persian Gulf, which would furnish Germany with the means of\r\nmaintaining her world-wide dominion (see p. 106).\r\n\r\nNow, as my readers have been able to see for themselves, there is, by\r\nreason of the temporary success of the Pangerman plot, abundance of\r\nunimpeachable arguments, numerical, geographical, ethnographical, in\r\nsupport of these conclusions. These irrefragable arguments are therefore\r\ncalculated to make the greatest impression on neutrals, because they\r\nare of a nature to appeal to their higher feelings and at the same\r\ntime to show how their own interests are jeopardized. If the Allied\r\npropaganda is once co-ordinated and fortified by these arguments, set\r\nforth methodically, the moral, economic, and military effects, which\r\nthe German propaganda has undoubtedly produced to the advantage of\r\nGermany, would soon be annulled, and the Allies would justly reap similar\r\nadvantages, which would hasten the victory.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n_Henceforth the Allies and the neutral states must bear constantly in\r\nmind not only Germany’s present gains on the East and on the West, but\r\nalso her Pangerman gains as a whole._\r\n\r\nThe accompanying map furnishes the justification of this conclusion. It\r\nis obvious that the German gains on the West and the East, important\r\nas they are, are relatively small by comparison with the enormous\r\nseizures which Germany has effected at the expense of Austria-Hungary,\r\nof half the Balkans, and of Turkey. We must fully understand that these\r\ncountries, especially Austria-Hungary, though they are allies of Germany,\r\nare nevertheless as truly under the German heel as Belgium, Poland, or\r\nthe invaded departments of France. There is therefore good ground for\r\nmaking no distinction between the Pangerman gains achieved by Germany\r\nat the cost of her open enemies (France and Russia) and those which the\r\nGovernment of Berlin has treacherously effected at the expense of her own\r\nallies, like Austria-Hungary.\r\n\r\nWhat the Allies and the neutral states have to consider is the Pangerman\r\ngains taken as a whole, in order to discriminate those which are\r\ncalculated to upset the balance of power in the world, and consequently\r\nto establish German supremacy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PANGERMAN GAINS AT THE BEGINNING OF 1916.]\r\n\r\nNow it is certain that if Germany were to give up her gains in the East\r\nand the West, while maintaining her seizures in the South and South-East,\r\nher power would at that moment be formidably increased as compared with\r\nwhat it was before the war. That, therefore, would be an indisputable\r\nand enormous victory for Pangermanism. The sketch map, inserted below,\r\nrepresents this truth in a graphic form. From Berlin radiate the lines on\r\nwhich are stretched the threads of that immense spider’s web which covers\r\nthe whole of the enormous Pangerman gains achieved by Germany in the\r\ncourse of the war. These gains she has been able to effect by means of\r\n\r\n1º. The very skilful political turn which she has adroitly given to her\r\nmilitary operations.\r\n\r\n2º. The ignorance of the Pangerman plan among the Allies. The knowledge\r\nof it would in fact have suggested to them from the very beginning of\r\nthe campaign the need of intervening through Salonika and the south of\r\nHungary, which would have destroyed the chief part of the German plan by\r\nrendering impossible the junction of the Central Empires with Bulgaria\r\nand Turkey.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n_The temporary achievement, almost in its entirety, of the Pangerman\r\nscheme “from Hamburg to the Persian Gulf,” proves that the complete\r\nvictory of the Allies is necessary for the freedom of the world._\r\n\r\nAs it is no longer possible to question either the reality or the\r\nextent of the plan of universal domination pursued by the Germans, it\r\nfollows that all civilized States are undoubtedly concerned in the\r\ndefeat of Prussianized Germany, since a German victory would have a most\r\ndetrimental effect on their interests. Accordingly, the Neutral States\r\nwhose independence would be especially threatened by the accomplishment\r\nof the “Hamburg to the Persian Gulf” scheme, have a really vital interest\r\nin the continuance of the war by the Allies till a complete victory\r\ncrowns their arms. Such a decisive victory is a necessity not only for\r\nEurope, but for the whole world, since the achievement of the “Hamburg\r\nto the Persian Gulf” scheme would have world-wide consequences (see p.\r\n107). That victory should have for its main object to deliver the world\r\nfrom the Pangerman peril, and therefore to prevent any future outbreak of\r\nthe intolerable ambition of the Hohenzollerns. The victory of the Allies\r\ninvolves a pledge to destroy the “Hamburg to the Persian Gulf” project,\r\nwhich forms the indispensable but sufficient basis of the whole Pangerman\r\nplan.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\n_The plan of slavery pursued by Germany is now so manifest that neutrals\r\nor Germanophile groups are henceforth morally responsible for their\r\nsentiments before the civilized world._\r\n\r\nThe neutrals who, in the first part of the war, displayed sympathy for\r\nGermany, were excusable because they were deceived; but now they are in\r\na different position. The facts are patent. It is no longer possible for\r\nanyone to see in Prussianized Germany anything but a ferocious burglar\r\nand assassin practising his trade of robbery and murder at the expense\r\nof the whole commonwealth of nations. In the fine phrase of M. Paul\r\nHyacinthe Loyson, Can neutrals be neutral in the face of crime? Clearly\r\nnot. As the _Daily Telegraph_ said very justly: “_Those who refuse to\r\noccupy a vacant seat at the Round Table of chivalry will have to render\r\nan account at the judgment bar of Humanity._” As matters now stand, in\r\nface of the crimes committed by the “miscreants of Central Europe”—the\r\nphrase is that of the Dutchman M. Schroeder—neutrals cannot support\r\nGermany in any way without rendering themselves her accomplices.\r\n\r\nThis truth is made so manifest by the course of events that already a\r\nchange is coming over two neutral countries, which had been thought\r\nGermanophile. Spanish opinion, a part of which had long been deceived by\r\nthe German propaganda, is coming round more and more. Sweden, which the\r\npressure and the audacious temptations of Berlin all but plunged into\r\nthe strife, to the great benefit of Pangermany, is now anxious not to\r\nseparate her cause from that of civilization; her responsible leaders\r\nhave just proclaimed that Sweden will maintain a strict neutrality.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\n_The declarations of the Allies, the accomplishment of the “Hamburg to\r\nthe Persian Gulf” scheme, and the question of Austria-Hungary._\r\n\r\nIn receiving the French deputies in London, on April 11th, 1916, Mr.\r\nAsquith declared: “I have said already in November that we would not\r\nsheathe the sword till the military domination of Prussia has been\r\ndestroyed once and for all. In this struggle we are the champions not\r\nonly of the rights of treaties but of the independence and the free\r\ndevelopment of the weaker countries.” (See _L’Œuvre_, April 12th, 1916.)\r\n\r\nSir Edward Grey, in an interview with a correspondent of the _Daily News_\r\nof Chicago affirmed: “We and our Allies are fighting for a free Europe,\r\nan Europe freed not only from the domination of one nation by another,\r\nbut also from a hectoring diplomacy, from the danger of war, etc. The\r\nAllies cannot tolerate any peace which would leave the wrongs done by\r\nthis war unrighted. We desire a peace that will do justice to all.”\r\n(Quoted by _Le Temps_, May 17th, 1916.)\r\n\r\nM. Sazonoff, speaking in the name of Russia, said: “Our victory must\r\nbe absolute. The Allies will continue to fight till mankind is rid of\r\nPrussianism.” (Quoted by _Le Temps_, February 27th, 1916.)\r\n\r\nAt Nancy, on May 13th, 1916, M. Poincaré declared: “France will not\r\nsurrender her sons to the danger of fresh aggressions. We do not wish the\r\nCentral Empires to offer us peace, we wish that they should ask it of us;\r\nwe will not submit to their conditions, we will impose ours on them; we\r\ndo not want a peace that would leave Imperial Germany free to begin the\r\nwar again and to hang a sword for ever over the head of Europe; we want a\r\npeace which shall receive at the hands of Justice, restored to her own,\r\nsolid guarantees of permanence and stability. So long as that peace is\r\nnot assured to us, so long as our enemies shall not confess themselves\r\nvanquished, we shall not cease to fight.” (Quoted by _Le Temps_, May\r\n15th, 1916.)\r\n\r\nOn May 22nd, 1916, in replying to the members of the Russian Duma, M. A.\r\nBriand, President of the French Council, similarly declared:—\r\n\r\n“I have said, and I repeat, while rivers of blood are flowing, while our\r\nsoldiers are sacrificing their lives with such forgetfulness of self,\r\nthe word peace is a sacrilege, if it means that the aggressor will not\r\nbe punished, and if tomorrow Europe shall run the risk of being handed\r\nover once more to the humours and the caprices of a military caste\r\nbloated with pride and athirst for power. It would be a dishonour to the\r\nAllies. What answer should we have to make if tomorrow, after having\r\nconcluded such a peace, our countries were again swept into the frenzy of\r\narmaments? What would the generations to come say if we were to commit\r\nsuch a folly, and if we let slip the opportunity which now presents\r\nitself of establishing a lasting peace on a solid basis? Peace will\r\nresult from the victory of the Allies, it can result from nothing but our\r\nvictory.” (See _Le Temps_, May 24th, 1916.)\r\n\r\nFrom all these declarations of the Allies two fundamental ideas stand\r\nclearly out:—\r\n\r\n    Prussian militarism must be destroyed;\r\n\r\n    The nationalities of Europe must be liberated from the Prussian\r\n    yoke.\r\n\r\nBut, as we have proved, the accomplishment of the “Hamburg to the Persian\r\nGulf” scheme has two essential objects:—\r\n\r\n    A formidable extension of Prussian militarism, which would have\r\n    at its disposal an army of 15 to 21 million men (see p. 91);\r\n\r\n    The enslavement to Germany of all the non-German nationalities\r\n    lying between the south of Saxony and the Persian Gulf.\r\n\r\nThe objects of the war pursued by the Allies and those of the government\r\nof William II. are therefore fundamentally opposed to each other. This\r\nopposition has been by implication excellently stated by M. Marcel\r\nCachin, Socialist deputy, in an article which appeared in _L’Humanité_,\r\nof May 9th, 1916, under the title “Central Europe.”\r\n\r\n“The general plan of our enemies can be clearly defined. In case they\r\nwere victorious, they would establish in the heart of Europe a formidable\r\npower under the supremacy of Germany, a power which, with the annexations\r\navowedly aimed at, would comprise more than 130 millions of inhabitants.\r\n\r\n“It needs no big words to show the danger which the whole of Europe\r\nwould run were such a design executed. It would be an eternal menace\r\nto our country. No one can for a moment doubt that so long as the\r\nexisting political systems of Germany and Austria endure, such a\r\nmonstrous combination would be a permanent danger against which we should\r\nconstantly be obliged to be on our guard. And as for the Slav populations\r\nreduced again to slavery, as for the Czechs, the Poles, the Yougo-Slavs,\r\nthe Serbians, they would naturally think of nothing but of revenge in\r\norder to escape from serfdom and recover their national rights, which had\r\nbeen trampled under foot. Were such a brutal unification as is summed up\r\nin _Mitteleuropa_ to be unfortunately accomplished by fire and sword, we\r\nmight talk of peace after the storm, but it would be talk in vain; it\r\nwould be war again, fatal war.”\r\n\r\nThere spoke sound sense. It is clear that to have done once for all with\r\nPrussian militarism is the only way open to the Allies to procure a\r\nreasonable guarantee that so atrocious a war shall never be waged again,\r\nand that millions of men shall not once more be sacrificed to the Moloch\r\nof Pangermanism. Hence the official declarations of the Allies, quoted\r\nabove, are not the product of blind obduracy, as the German propaganda\r\nwould make some neutrals believe. In view of the formidable plan of\r\nuniversal domination which the Germans still cling to, the seeming\r\nobduracy of the Allies is on their part the highest wisdom.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\n_The question of Austria-Hungary, being the crucial point of the whole\r\nproblem to be solved after the war, may become the common ground on\r\nwhich all common efforts should be concentrated, not only by the present\r\nAllies, but also by the still neutral States which are virtually\r\nthreatened by the accomplishment of the “Hamburg to the Persian Gulf”\r\nscheme._\r\n\r\nIt is probable that Prussian militarism would have been already\r\ndestroyed, or on the point of being so, if in the first part of the war\r\nthe leaders of the Allied countries had not committed the three capital\r\nmistakes which to-day are generally acknowledged—the Balkan policy of\r\n1915, the Dardanelles, the delay in sending reinforcements to Serbia.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that these three calamitous mistakes have entailed a\r\nconsiderable prolongation of the struggle and allowed Germany to build up\r\nthe immense fortress which extends from Dunkirk on the north to Egypt on\r\nthe south, and from the south of Riga to Bagdad (see the map on p. 72).\r\nIn order to overthrow the mighty walls of this formidable fortress, the\r\nAllies must consent to sacrifices much greater and more prolonged than\r\nwould have been necessary if the mistakes now generally acknowledged\r\nhad not been committed. These sacrifices the Allied peoples accept with\r\na devotion and heroism which will win the imperishable admiration of\r\nposterity. But just because the faults committed have lengthened the\r\nduration of the struggle, the leaders of the Allied countries are in\r\nduty bound to do everything they can to accelerate a complete victory.\r\nThat victory would be considerably hastened by the accession of the\r\nforces, whether economic or military, of the still neutral countries\r\nwhich, though they are even yet not fully aware of it, would be directly\r\nendangered by the success of the Pangerman plan.\r\n\r\nI have shown on p. 219 how a systematic propaganda of the Allies, taking\r\nas its text the temporary accomplishment of the Pangerman plot, might\r\nspeedily demonstrate to neutrals the falsehood of the German sophistries\r\nby which they have been cajoled. The same propaganda should have for\r\nits second object to convince these neutrals that they have as much to\r\ngain as the Allies by the destruction of Prussian militarism and of\r\nthe “Hamburg to the Persian Gulf” project. If once this were clearly\r\ndemonstrated it would be both legitimate and possible to request of these\r\nneutrals that they should contribute, in the measure of their power, to\r\nthe common task of saving the civilization of the world.\r\n\r\nIn order rapidly to secure practical results from a convincing\r\npropaganda, it is necessary to define very clearly what in the vast\r\nwelter of the present struggle is the point of vital interest common to\r\nall the States of the World. As I have shown in the course of this book,\r\nwhat would provide Germany with the means of establishing her universal\r\ndominion would be the accomplishment, whether direct, or indirect, of\r\nher scheme “from Hamburg to the Persian Gulf.” On the other hand, I\r\nbelieve I have demonstrated that to prevent the accomplishment of that\r\nscheme it is enough, but it is necessary, that the Latin and Slav peoples\r\nof Austria-Hungary should be freed, once for all, from the yoke which\r\nGermany has imposed on them through the opportunity given her by the\r\nwar. For if the majority of these peoples were to be combined as a State\r\nin place of Austria-Hungary, probably in a federal form, there would\r\nat once be set up in Central Europe an immovable barrier which would\r\nensure the world against any revival of Pangerman aggression (see the map\r\non p. 43). On the other hand, if the independence of the Slav peoples\r\nof Austria-Hungary were not secured against Berlin, the extension of\r\nPrussian militarism to the Balkans and Turkey would be inevitable; the\r\nAllied peoples would have made all their unheard-of sacrifices in vain,\r\nand the struggle against Prussianism would be bound to continue.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EUROPEAN STATES INTERESTED IN THE SOLUTION OF THE\r\nAUSTRO-HUNGARIAN QUESTION.]\r\n\r\nFrom these considerations it follows that the question of\r\nAustria-Hungary, just because its solution implies the downfall of the\r\n“Hamburg to the Persian Gulf” castle-in-the-air, constitutes the crucial\r\npoint not only of the European problem, but of the whole problem which\r\nthe Pangerman plan of universal domination raises for all civilized\r\nStates. Consequently the solution of the question of Austria-Hungary, on\r\nthe basis of the principle of nationalities, forms the bond of common\r\ninterest not only between the belligerent Allies but also between all the\r\nstill neutral States of the world who are threatened in any degree by the\r\naccomplishment of the scheme “from Hamburg to the Persian Gulf.”\r\n\r\nThe annexed maps show clearly the States of the world for which the\r\nsolution of the question of Austria-Hungary has an interest greater or\r\nless in degree but substantially identical.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that if Germany could keep her hold permanently on\r\nAustria-Hungary, Russia would be constantly threatened. In consequence\r\nof the extension of Prussian militarism which would result therefrom,\r\nEngland would be forced to continue to maintain the formidable armaments\r\nwhich she has accepted only as a temporary measure. As for France, no\r\nrestoration of Alsace-Lorraine could be lasting, if the vassal regiments\r\nof Austria-Hungary should give the government of Berlin, after a brief\r\nbreathing-space, the power to wrench again from France the provinces\r\nwhich had been temporarily ceded. Belgium would be threatened for the\r\nsame reason. As for Italy, German supremacy over Central Europe would\r\nbe the end of all Italian hopes on the Adriatic, and of all Italian\r\nexpansion over the Eastern Mediterranean. As for Serbia and Montenegro,\r\nthat dominion would be a sentence of death without appeal. For Portugal,\r\nit would imply the loss of her territories beyond the sea in virtue of\r\nthe consequences which would follow the achievement of the plan “from\r\nHamburg to the Persian Gulf.”\r\n\r\nBut countries still neutral, such as Greece, Roumania[6], Holland, and\r\nSwitzerland, at which the Pangerman musket is levelled point-blank,\r\nought also to be convinced that their most solid interests, in complete\r\nharmony with their moral obligations to the cause of civilization, make\r\nit their duty to lend the Allies all the support they can, whether it be\r\nmoral, economic, or military.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE STATES OF ASIA AND AMERICA, INTERESTED IN THE SOLUTION\r\nOF THE AUSTRO-HUNGARIAN QUESTION.]\r\n\r\nThe second map shows the group of States in Asia and America which,\r\nmenaced by the world-wide consequences of the “Hamburg to the Persian\r\nGulf” scheme, have also a high and direct interest in the solution of the\r\nAustro-Hungarian question. Japan is already helping the Allies notably,\r\nbut her assistance might be still ampler, more effective and more direct.\r\nThe strictest view of her interest should compel her to enlarge the scope\r\nof her succour, since nothing but the total defeat of Germany in Europe\r\ncan prevent Japan from witnessing a long series of disturbances fomented\r\nat her expense in the Chinese Empire (see p. 98). As I have already\r\nshown (p. 105) many States in South America are directly aimed at by the\r\nPangerman plan of 1911. But that plan can never be really formidable\r\nfor these States, unless Germany should one day have at her disposal the\r\npowerful resources which would accrue to her from the accomplishment\r\nof the scheme “from Hamburg to the Persian Gulf.” Chili, Argentina,\r\nUruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia, Colombia, Brazil, have all been the object\r\nof preparatory Pangerman manœuvres. That warning ought to convince them\r\nwithout delay that they have an undoubted interest in co-operating,\r\nto some extent, in the common cause. They could do so, particularly\r\nArgentina and Brazil, to good purpose in the economic sphere.\r\n\r\nAs for the United States, we have seen (p. 208) that the accomplishment\r\nof the scheme “from Hamburg to the Persian Gulf” would really jeopardize\r\ntheir independence in the gravest manner. No doubt that point of view has\r\nnot yet been generally apprehended in the United States, but a propaganda\r\nwhich could easily be carried on, since the arguments in its favour are\r\nabundant, should serve to convince the Americans that in fighting on the\r\nbattlefields of Europe the Allied soldiers are really safeguarding the\r\nfuture of the great American Republic. On the day when that conviction\r\nbecomes general, the Americans will not hesitate to lend the European\r\nAllies such assistance of various sorts as must hasten the coming of\r\ncomplete victory.\r\n\r\nTo recapitulate, a series of deductions, all based on acknowledged facts\r\nand all easily verifiable, leads to the conclusion that the formidable\r\nproblem with which German aggression has confronted the civilized\r\nworld is summed up in the solution of the Austro-Hungarian question,\r\nbecause that solution, which can be worked out without prejudice to the\r\nlegitimate interests of the German people (see Chapter VI § 111), is\r\nthe only means of putting an end to the Hohenzollern plan of universal\r\ndomination, founded on the scheme “from Hamburg to the Persian Gulf.”\r\n\r\nBut when the question of Austria-Hungary shall have been solved, the\r\nproblems peculiar to each of the Allies will by way of corollary be\r\nsolved also. And in general, by securing the independence of the\r\nnon-German peoples of Central Europe—a measure the justice of which is\r\nindisputable—we shall effectually protect the world as a whole against\r\nany future eruption of the intolerable Pangerman ambition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] At that date the designation Austria was comprehensive of what we now\r\ncall Austria-Hungary.\r\n\r\n[2] This passage was written before Yuan-Shi-Kai’s death. _Translator’s\r\nNote._\r\n\r\n[3] A French translation of this work, by M.
