The country was shrouded\r\nin mourning for the loss of its venerable Chief Magistrate and all hearts\r\nwere penetrated with grief. Neither the time nor the occasion appeared to\r\nrequire or to justify on my part any general expression of political\r\nopinions or any announcement of the principles which would govern me in the\r\ndischarge of the duties to the performance of which I had been so\r\nunexpectedly called. I trust, therefore, that it may not be deemed\r\ninappropriate if I avail myself of this opportunity of the reassembling of\r\nCongress to make known my sentiments in a general manner in regard to the\r\npolicy which ought to be pursued by the Government both in its intercourse\r\nwith foreign nations and its management and administration of internal\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nNations, like individuals in a state of nature, are equal and independent,\r\npossessing certain rights and owing certain duties to each other, arising\r\nfrom their necessary and unavoidable relations; which rights and duties\r\nthere is no common human authority to protect and enforce. Still, they are\r\nrights and duties, binding in morals, in conscience, and in honor, although\r\nthere is no tribunal to which an injured party can appeal but the\r\ndisinterested judgment of mankind, and ultimately the arbitrament of the\r\nsword.\r\n\r\nAmong the acknowledged rights of nations is that which each possesses of\r\nestablishing that form of government which it may deem most conducive to\r\nthe happiness and prosperity of its own citizens, of changing that form as\r\ncircumstances may require, and of managing its internal affairs according\r\nto its own will. The people of the United States claim this right for\r\nthemselves, and they readily concede it to others. Hence it becomes an\r\nimperative duty not to interfere in the government or internal policy of\r\nother nations; and although we may sympathize with the unfortunate or the\r\noppressed everywhere in their struggles for freedom, our principles forbid\r\nus from taking any part in such foreign contests. We make no wars to\r\npromote or to prevent successions to thrones, to maintain any theory of a\r\nbalance of power, or to suppress the actual government which any country\r\nchooses to establish for itself. We instigate no revolutions, nor suffer\r\nany hostile military expeditions to be fitted out in the United States to\r\ninvade the territory or provinces of a friendly nation. The great law of\r\nmorality ought to have a national as well as a personal and individual\r\napplication. We should act toward other nations as we wish them to act\r\ntoward us, and justice and conscience should form the rule of conduct\r\nbetween governments, instead of mere power, self interest, or the desire of\r\naggrandizement. To maintain a strict neutrality in foreign wars, to\r\ncultivate friendly relations, to reciprocate every noble and generous act,\r\nand to perform punctually and scrupulously every treaty obligation--these\r\nare the duties which we owe to other states, and by the performance of\r\nwhich we best entitle ourselves to like treatment from them; or, if that,\r\nin any case, be refused, we can enforce our own rights with justice and a\r\nclear conscience.\r\n\r\nIn our domestic policy the Constitution will be my guide, and in questions\r\nof doubt I shall look for its interpretation to the judicial decisions of\r\nthat tribunal which was established to expound it and to the usage of the\r\nGovernment, sanctioned by the acquiescence of the country. I regard all its\r\nprovisions as equally binding. In all its parts it is the will of the\r\npeople expressed in the most solemn form, and the constituted authorities\r\nare but agents to carry that will into effect. Every power which it has\r\ngranted is to be exercised for the public good; but no pretense of utility,\r\nno honest conviction, even, of what might be expedient, can justify the\r\nassumption of any power not granted. The powers conferred upon the\r\nGovernment and their distribution to the several departments are as clearly\r\nexpressed in that sacred instrument as the imperfection of human language\r\nwill allow, and I deem it my first duty not to question its wisdom, add to\r\nits provisions, evade its requirements, or nullify its commands.\r\n\r\nUpon you, fellow-citizens, as the representatives of the States and the\r\npeople, is wisely devolved the legislative power. I shall comply with my\r\nduty in laying before you from time to time any information calculated to\r\nenable you to discharge your high and responsible trust for the benefit of\r\nour common constituents.\r\n\r\nMy opinions will be frankly expressed upon the leading subjects of\r\nlegislation; and if--which I do not anticipate--any act should pass the two\r\nHouses of Congress which should appear to me unconstitutional, or an\r\nencroachment on the just powers of other departments, or with provisions\r\nhastily adopted and likely to produce consequences injurious and\r\nunforeseen, I should not shrink from the duty of returning it to you, with\r\nmy reasons, for your further consideration. Beyond the due performance of\r\nthese constitutional obligations, both my respect for the Legislature and\r\nmy sense of propriety will restrain me from any attempt to control or\r\ninfluence your proceedings. With you is the power, the honor, and the\r\nresponsibility of the legislation of the country.\r\n\r\nThe Government of the United States is a limited Government. It is confined\r\nto the exercise of powers expressly granted and such others as may be\r\nnecessary for carrying those powers into effect; and it is at all times an\r\nespecial duty to guard against any infringement on the just rights of the\r\nStates. Over the objects and subjects intrusted to Congress its legislative\r\nauthority is supreme. But here that authority ceases, and every citizen who\r\ntruly loves the Constitution and desires the continuance of its existence\r\nand its blessings will resolutely and firmly resist any interference in\r\nthose domestic affairs which the Constitution has dearly and unequivocally\r\nleft to the exclusive authority of the States. And every such citizen will\r\nalso deprecate useless irritation among the several members of the Union\r\nand all reproach and crimination tending to alienate one portion of the\r\ncountry from another. The beauty of our system of government consists, and\r\nits safety and durability must consist, in avoiding mutual collisions and\r\nencroachments and in the regular separate action of all, while each is\r\nrevolving in its own distinct orbit.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution has made it the duty of the President to take care that\r\nthe laws be faithfully executed. In a government like ours, in which all\r\nlaws are passed by a majority of the representatives of the people, and\r\nthese representatives are chosen for such short periods that any injurious\r\nor obnoxious law can very soon be repealed, it would appear unlikely that\r\nany great numbers should be found ready to resist the execution of the\r\nlaws. But it must be borne in mind that the country is extensive; that\r\nthere may be local interests or prejudices rendering a law odious in one\r\npart which is not so in another, and that the thoughtless and\r\ninconsiderate, misled by their passions or their imaginations, may be\r\ninduced madly to resist such laws as they disapprove. Such persons should\r\nrecollect that without law there can be no real practical liberty; that\r\nwhen law is trampled under foot tyranny rules, whether it appears in the\r\nform of a military despotism or of popular violence. The law is the only\r\nsure protection of the weak and the only efficient restraint upon the\r\nstrong. When impartially and faithfully administered, none is beneath its\r\nprotection and none above its control. You, gentlemen, and the country may\r\nbe assured that to the utmost of my ability and to the extent of the power\r\nvested in me I shall at all times and in all places take care that the laws\r\nbe faithfully executed. In the discharge of this duty, solemnly imposed\r\nupon me by the Constitution and by my oath of office, I shall shrink from\r\nno responsibility, and shall endeavor to meet events as they may arise with\r\nfirmness, as well as with prudence and discretion.\r\n\r\nThe appointing power is one of the most delicate with which the Executive\r\nis invested. I regard it as a sacred trust, to be exercised with the sole\r\nview of advancing the prosperity and happiness of the people. It shall be\r\nmy effort to elevate the standard of official employment by selecting for\r\nplaces of importance individuals fitted for the posts to which they are\r\nassigned by their known integrity, talents, and virtues. In so extensive a\r\ncountry, with so great a population, and where few persons appointed to\r\noffice can be known to the appointing power, mistakes will sometimes\r\nunavoidably happen and unfortunate appointments be made notwithstanding the\r\ngreatest care. In such cases the power of removal may be properly\r\nexercised; and neglect of duty or malfeasance in office will be no more\r\ntolerated in individuals appointed by myself than in those appointed by\r\nothers. I am happy in being able to say that no unfavorable change in our\r\nforeign relations has taken place since the message at the opening of the\r\nlast session of Congress. We are at peace with all nations and we enjoy in\r\nan eminent degree the blessings of that peace in a prosperous and growing\r\ncommerce and in all the forms of amicable national intercourse. The\r\nunexampled growth of the country, the present amount of its population, and\r\nits ample means of self-protection assure for it the respect of all\r\nnations, while it is trusted that its character for justice and a regard to\r\nthe rights of other States will cause that respect to be readily and\r\ncheerfully paid.\r\n\r\nA convention was negotiated between the United States and Great Britain in\r\nApril last for facilitating and protecting the construction of a ship canal\r\nbetween the Atlantic and Pacific oceans and for other purposes. The\r\ninstrument has since been ratified by the contracting parties, the exchange\r\nof ratifications has been effected, and proclamation thereof has been duly\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the stipulations contained in this convention, two other\r\nobjects remain to be accomplished between the contracting powers: First.\r\nThe designation and establishment of a free port at each end of the canal.\r\n\r\nSecond. An agreement fixing the distance from the shore within which\r\nbelligerent maritime operations shall not be carried on. On these points\r\nthere is little doubt that the two Governments will come to an\r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\nThe company of citizens of the United States who have acquired from the\r\nState of Nicaragua the privilege of constructing a ship canal between the\r\ntwo oceans through the territory of that State have made progress in their\r\npreliminary arrangements. The treaty between the United States and Great\r\nBritain of the 19th of April last, above referred to, being now in\r\noperation, it is to be hoped that the guaranties which it offers will be\r\nsufficient to secure the completion of the work with all practicable\r\nexpedition. It is obvious that this result would be indefinitely postponed\r\nif any other than peaceful measures for the purpose of harmonizing\r\nconflicting claims to territory in that quarter should be adopted. It will\r\nconsequently be my endeavor to cause any further negotiations on the part\r\nof this Government which may be requisite for this purpose to be so\r\nconducted as to bring them to a speedy and successful close.\r\n\r\nSome unavoidable delay has occurred, arising from distance and the\r\ndifficulty of intercourse between this Government and that of Nicaragua,\r\nbut as intelligence has just been received of the appointment of an envoy\r\nextraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of that Government to reside at\r\nWashington, whose arrival may soon be expected, it is hoped that no further\r\nimpediments will be experienced in the prompt transaction of business\r\nbetween the two Governments.\r\n\r\nCitizens of the United States have undertaken the connection of the two\r\noceans by means of a railroad across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, under\r\ngrants of the Mexican Government to a citizen of that Republic. It is\r\nunderstood that a thorough survey of the course of the communication is in\r\npreparation, and there is every reason to expect that it will be prosecuted\r\nwith characteristic energy, especially when that Government shall have\r\nconsented to such stipulations with the Government of the United States as\r\nmay be necessary to impart a feeling of security to those who may embark\r\ntheir property in the enterprise. Negotiations are pending for the\r\naccomplishment of that object, and a hope is confidently entertained that\r\nwhen the Government of Mexico shall become duly sensible of the advantages\r\nwhich that country can not fail to derive from the work, and learn that the\r\nGovernment of the United States desires that the right of sovereignty of\r\nMexico in the Isthmus shall remain unimpaired, the stipulations referred to\r\nwill be agreed to with alacrity.\r\n\r\nBy the last advices from Mexico it would appear, however, that that\r\nGovernment entertains strong objections to some of the stipulations which\r\nthe parties concerned in the project of the railroad deem necessary for\r\ntheir protection and security. Further consideration, it is to be hoped, or\r\nsome modification of terms, may yet reconcile the differences existing\r\nbetween the two Governments in this respect.\r\n\r\nFresh instructions have recently been given to the minister of the United\r\nStates in Mexico, who is prosecuting the subject with promptitude and\r\nability.\r\n\r\nAlthough the negotiations with Portugal for the payment of claims of\r\ncitizens of the United States against that Government have not yet resulted\r\nin a formal treaty, yet a proposition, made by the Government of Portugal\r\nfor the final adjustment and payment of those claims, has recently been\r\naccepted on the part of the United States. It gives me pleasure to say that\r\nMr. Clay, to whom the negotiation on the part of the United States had been\r\nintrusted, discharged the duties of his appointment with ability and\r\ndiscretion, acting always within the instructions of his Government.\r\n\r\nIt is expected that a regular convention will be immediately negotiated for\r\ncarrying the agreement between the two Governments into effect. The\r\ncommissioner appointed under the act of Congress for carrying into effect\r\nthe convention with Brazil of the 27th of January, 1849, has entered upon\r\nthe performance of the duties imposed upon him by that act. It is hoped\r\nthat those duties may be completed within the time which it prescribes. The\r\ndocuments, however, which the Imperial Government, by the third article of\r\nthe convention, stipulates to furnish to the Government of the United\r\nStates have not yet been received. As it is presumed that those documents\r\nwill be essential for the correct disposition of the claims, it may become\r\nnecessary for Congress to extend the period limited for the duration of the\r\ncommission. The sum stipulated by the fourth article of the convention to\r\nbe paid to this Government has been received.\r\n\r\nThe collection in the ports of the United States of discriminating duties\r\nupon the vessels of Chili and their cargoes has been suspended, pursuant to\r\nthe provisions of the act of Congress of the 24th of May, 1828. It is to be\r\nhoped that this measure will impart a fresh impulse to the commerce between\r\nthe two countries, which of late, and especially since our acquisition of\r\nCalifornia, has, to the mutual advantage of the parties, been much\r\naugmented.\r\n\r\nPeruvian guano has become so desirable an article to the agricultural\r\ninterest of the United States that it is the duty of the Government to\r\nemploy all the means properly in its power for the purpose of causing that\r\narticle to be imported into the country at a reasonable price. Nothing will\r\nbe omitted on my part toward accomplishing this desirable end. I am\r\npersuaded that in removing any restraints on this traffic the Peruvian\r\nGovernment will promote its own best interests, while it will afford a\r\nproof of a friendly disposition toward this country, which will be duly\r\nappreciated.\r\n\r\nThe treaty between the United States and His Majesty the King of the\r\nHawaiian Islands, which has recently been made public, will, it is\r\nbelieved, have a beneficial effect upon the relations between the two\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nThe relations between those parts of the island of St. Domingo which were\r\nformerly colonies of Spain and France, respectively, are still in an\r\nunsettled condition. The proximity of that island to the United States and\r\nthe delicate questions involved in the existing controversy there render it\r\ndesirable that it should be permanently and speedily adjusted. The\r\ninterests of humanity and of general commerce also demand this; and as\r\nintimations of the same sentiment have been received from other\r\ngovernments, it is hoped that some plan may soon be devised to effect the\r\nobject in a manner likely to give general satisfaction. The Government of\r\nthe United States will not fail, by the exercise of all proper friendly\r\noffices, to do all in its power to put an end to the destructive war which\r\nhas raged between the different parts of the island and to secure to them\r\nboth the benefits of peace and commerce.\r\n\r\nI refer you to the report of the Secretary of the Treasury for a detailed\r\nstatement of the finances.\r\n\r\nThe total receipts into the Treasury for the year ending 30th of June last\r\nwere $47,421,748.90. The total expenditures during the same period were\r\n$43,002,168.90. The public debt has been reduced since the last annual\r\nreport from the Treasury Department $495,276.79.\r\n\r\nBy the nineteenth section of the act of 28th January, 1847, the proceeds of\r\nthe sales of the public lands were pledged for the interest and principal\r\nof the public debt. The great amount of those lands subsequently granted by\r\nCongress for military bounties will, it is believed, very nearly supply the\r\npublic demand for several years to come, and but little reliance can,\r\ntherefore, be placed on that hitherto fruitful source of revenue. Aside\r\nfrom the permanent annual expenditures, which have necessarily largely\r\nincreased, a portion of the public debt, amounting to $8,075,986.59, must\r\nbe provided for within the next two fiscal years. It is most desirable that\r\nthese accruing demands should be met without resorting to new loans.\r\n\r\nAll experience has demonstrated the wisdom and policy of raising a large\r\nportion of revenue for the support of Government from duties on goods\r\nimported. The power to lay these duties is unquestionable, and its chief\r\nobject, of course, is to replenish the Treasury. But if in doing this an\r\nincidental advantage may be gained by encouraging the industry of our own\r\ncitizens, it is our duty to avail ourselves of that advantage.\r\n\r\nA duty laid upon an article which can not be produced in this country, such\r\nas tea or coffee, adds to the cost of the article, and is chiefly or wholly\r\npaid by the consumer. But a duty laid upon an article which may be produced\r\nhere stimulates the skill and industry of our own country to produce the\r\nsame article, which is brought into the market in competition with the\r\nforeign article, and the importer is thus compelled to reduce his price to\r\nthat at which the domestic article can be sold, thereby throwing a part of\r\nthe duty upon the producer of the foreign article. The continuance of this\r\nprocess creates the skill and invites the capital which finally enable us\r\nto produce the article much cheaper than it could have been procured from\r\nabroad, thereby benefiting both the producer and the consumer at home. The\r\nconsequence of this is that the artisan and the agriculturist are brought\r\ntogether, each affords a ready market for the produce of the other, the\r\nwhole country becomes prosperous, and the ability to produce every\r\nnecessary of life renders us independent in war as well as in peace.\r\n\r\nA high tariff can never be permanent. It will cause dissatisfaction, and\r\nwill be changed. It excludes competition, and thereby invites the\r\ninvestment of capital in manufactures to such excess that when changed it\r\nbrings distress, bankruptcy, and ruin upon all who have been misled by its\r\nfaithless protection. What the manufacturer wants is uniformity and\r\npermanency, that he may feel a confidence that he is not to be ruined by\r\nsudden exchanges. But to make a tariff uniform and permanent it is not only\r\nnecessary that the laws should not be altered, but that the duty should not\r\nfluctuate. To effect this all duties should be specific wherever the nature\r\nof the article is such as to admit of it. Ad valorem duties fluctuate with\r\nthe price and offer strong temptations to fraud and perjury. Specific\r\nduties, on the contrary, are equal and uniform in all ports and at all\r\ntimes, and offer a strong inducement to the importer to bring the best\r\narticle, as he pays no more duty upon that than upon one of inferior\r\nquality. I therefore strongly recommend a modification of the present\r\ntariff, which has prostrated some of our most important and necessary\r\nmanufactures, and that specific duties be imposed sufficient to raise the\r\nrequisite revenue, making such discriminations in favor of the industrial\r\npursuits of our own country as to encourage home production without\r\nexcluding foreign competition. It is also important that an unfortunate\r\nprovision in the present tariff, which imposes a much higher duty upon the\r\nraw material that enters into our manufactures than upon the manufactured\r\narticle, should be remedied.\r\n\r\nThe papers accompanying the report of the Secretary of the Treasury will\r\ndisclose frauds attempted upon the revenue, in variety and amount so great\r\nas to justify the conclusion that it is impossible under any system of ad\r\nvalorem duties levied upon the foreign cost or value of the article to\r\nsecure an honest observance and an effectual administration of the laws.\r\nThe fraudulent devices to evade the law which have been detected by the\r\nvigilance of the appraisers leave no room to doubt that similar impositions\r\nnot discovered, to a large amount, have been successfully practiced since\r\nthe enactment of the law now in force. This state of things has already had\r\na prejudicial influence upon those engaged in foreign commerce. It has a\r\ntendency to drive the honest trader from the business of importing and to\r\nthrow that important branch of employment into the hands of unscrupulous\r\nand dishonest men, who are alike regardless of law and the obligations of\r\nan oath. By these means the plain intentions of Congress, as expressed in\r\nthe law, are daily defeated. Every motive of policy and duty, therefore,\r\nimpels me to ask the earnest attention of Congress to this subject. If\r\nCongress should deem it unwise to attempt any important changes in the\r\nsystem of levying duties at this session, it will become indispensable to\r\nthe protection of the revenue that such remedies as in the judgment of\r\nCongress may mitigate the evils complained of should be at once applied.\r\n\r\nAs before stated, specific duties would, in my opinion, afford the most\r\nperfect remedy for this evil; but if you should not concur in this view,\r\nthen, as a partial remedy, I beg leave respectfully to recommend that\r\ninstead of taking the invoice of the article abroad as a means of\r\ndetermining its value here, the correctness of which invoice it is in many\r\ncases impossible to verify, the law be so changed as to require a home\r\nvaluation or appraisal, to be regulated in such manner as to give, as far\r\nas practicable, uniformity in the several ports.\r\n\r\nThere being no mint in California, I am informed that the laborers in the\r\nmines are compelled to dispose of their gold dust at a large discount. This\r\nappears to me to be a heavy and unjust tax upon the labor of those employed\r\nin extracting this precious metal, and I doubt not you will be disposed at\r\nthe earliest period possible to relieve them from it by the establishment\r\nof a mint. In the meantime, as an assayer's office is established there, I\r\nwould respectfully submit for your consideration the propriety of\r\nauthorizing gold bullion which has been assayed and stamped to be received\r\nin payment of Government dues. I can not conceive that the Treasury would\r\nsuffer any loss by such a provision, which will at once raise bullion to\r\nits par value, and thereby save (if I am rightly informed) many millions of\r\ndollars to the laborers which are now paid in brokerage to convert this\r\nprecious metal into available funds. This discount upon their hard earnings\r\nis a heavy tax, and every effort should be made by the Government to\r\nrelieve them from so great a burden.\r\n\r\nMore than three-fourths of our population are engaged in the cultivation of\r\nthe soil. The commercial, manufacturing, and navigating interests are all\r\nto a great extent dependent on the agricultural. It is therefore the most\r\nimportant interest of the nation, and has a just claim to the fostering\r\ncare and protection of the Government so far as they can be extended\r\nconsistently with the provisions of the Constitution. As this can not be\r\ndone by the ordinary modes of legislation, I respectfully recommend the\r\nestablishment of an agricultural bureau, to be charged with the duty of\r\ngiving to this leading branch of American industry the encouragement which\r\nit so well deserves. In view of the immense mineral resources of our\r\ncountry, provision should also be made for the employment of a competent\r\nmineralogist and chemist, who should be required, under the direction of\r\nthe head of the bureau, to collect specimens of the various minerals of our\r\ncountry and to ascertain by careful analysis their respective elements and\r\nproperties and their adaptation to useful purposes. He should also be\r\nrequired to examine and report upon the qualities of different soils and\r\nthe manures best calculated to improve their productiveness. By publishing\r\nthe results of such experiments, with suitable explanations, and by the\r\ncollection and distribution of rare seeds and plants, with instructions as\r\nto the best system of cultivation, much may be done to promote this great\r\nnational interest.\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the act of Congress passed on the 23d of May, 1850,\r\nproviding, among other things, for taking the Seventh Census, a\r\nsuperintendent was appointed and all other measures adopted which were\r\ndeemed necessary to insure the prompt and faithful performance of that\r\nduty. The appropriation already made will, it is believed, be sufficient to\r\ndefray the whole expense of the work, but further legislation may be\r\nnecessary in regard to the compensation of some of the marshals of the\r\nTerritories. It will also be proper to make provision by law at an early\r\nday for the publication of such abstracts of the returns as the public\r\ninterests may require.\r\n\r\nThe unprecedented growth of our territories on the Pacific in wealth and\r\npopulation and the consequent increase of their social and commercial\r\nrelations with the Atlantic States seem to render it the duty of the\r\nGovernment to use all its constitutional power to improve the means of\r\nintercourse with them. The importance of opening \"a line of communication,\r\nthe best and most expeditious of which the nature of the country will\r\nadmit,\" between the Valley of the Mississippi and the Pacific was brought\r\nto your notice by my predecessor in his annual message; and as the reasons\r\nwhich he presented in favor of the measure still exist in full force, I beg\r\nleave to call your attention to them and to repeat the recommendations then\r\nmade by him.\r\n\r\nThe uncertainty which exists in regard to the validity of land titles in\r\nCalifornia is a subject which demands your early consideration. Large\r\nbodies of land in that State are claimed under grants said to have been\r\nmade by authority of the Spanish and Mexican Governments. Many of these\r\nhave not been perfected, others have been revoked, and some are believed to\r\nbe fraudulent. But until they shall have been judicially investigated they\r\nwill continue to retard the settlement and improvement of the country. I\r\ntherefore respectfully recommend that provision be made by law for the\r\nappointment of commissioners to examine all such claims with a view to\r\ntheir final adjustment.\r\n\r\nI also beg leave to call your attention to the propriety of extending at an\r\nearly day our system of land laws, with such modifications as may be\r\nnecessary, over the State of California and the Territories of Utah and New\r\nMexico. The mineral lands of California will, of course, form an exception\r\nto any general system which may be adopted. Various methods of disposing of\r\nthem have been suggested. I was at first inclined to favor the system of\r\nleasing, as it seemed to promise the largest revenue to the Government and\r\nto afford the best security against monopolies; but further reflection and\r\nour experience in leasing the lead mines and selling lands upon credit have\r\nbrought my mind to the conclusion that there would be great difficulty in\r\ncollecting the rents, and that the relation of debtor and creditor between\r\nthe citizens and the Government would be attended with many mischievous\r\nconsequences. I therefore recommend that instead of retaining the mineral\r\nlands under the permanent control of the Government they be divided into\r\nsmall parcels and sold, under such restrictions as to quantity and time as\r\nwill insure the best price and guard most effectually against combinations\r\nof capitalists to obtain monopolies.\r\n\r\nThe annexation of Texas and the acquisition of California and New Mexico\r\nhave given increased importance to our Indian relations. The various tribes\r\nbrought under our jurisdiction by these enlargements of our boundaries are\r\nestimated to embrace a population of 124,000. Texas and New Mexico are\r\nsurrounded by powerful tribes of Indians, who are a source of constant\r\nterror and annoyance to the inhabitants. Separating into small predatory\r\nbands, and always mounted, they overrun the country, devastating farms,\r\ndestroying crops, driving off whole herds of cattle, and occasionally\r\nmurdering the inhabitants or carrying them into captivity. The great roads\r\nleading into the country are infested with them, whereby traveling is\r\nrendered extremely dangerous and immigration is almost entirely arrested.\r\nThe Mexican frontier, which by the eleventh article of the treaty of\r\nGuadalupe Hidalgo we are bound to protect against the Indians within our\r\nborder, is exposed to these incursions equally with our own. The military\r\nforce stationed in that country, although forming a large proportion of the\r\nArmy, is represented as entirely inadequate to our own protection and the\r\nfulfillment of our treaty stipulations with Mexico. The principal\r\ndeficiency is in cavalry, and I recommend that Congress should, at as early\r\na period as practicable, provide for the raising of one or more regiments\r\nof mounted men.\r\n\r\nFor further suggestions on this subject and others connected with our\r\ndomestic interests and the defense of our frontier, I refer you to the\r\nreports of the Secretary of the Interior and of the Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nI commend also to your favorable consideration the suggestion contained in\r\nthe last-mentioned report and in the letter of the General in Chief\r\nrelative to the establishment of an asylum for the relief of disabled and\r\ndestitute soldiers. This subject appeals so strongly to your sympathies\r\nthat it would be superfluous in me to say anything more than barely to\r\nexpress my cordial approbation of the proposed object.\r\n\r\nThe Navy continues to give protection to our commerce and other national\r\ninterests in the different quarters of the globe, and, with the exception\r\nof a single steamer on the Northern lakes, the vessels in commission are\r\ndistributed in six different squadrons.\r\n\r\nThe report of the head of that Department will exhibit the services of\r\nthese squadrons and of the several vessels employed in each during the past\r\nyear. It is a source of gratification that, while they have been constantly\r\nprepared for any hostile emergency, they have everywhere met with the\r\nrespect and courtesy due as well to the dignity as to the peaceful\r\ndispositions and just purposes of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe two brigantines accepted by the Government from a generous citizen of\r\nNew York and placed under the command of an officer of the Navy to proceed\r\nto the Arctic Seas in quest of the British commander Sir John Franklin and\r\nhis companions, in compliance with the act of Congress approved in May\r\nlast, had when last heard from penetrated into a high northern latitude;\r\nbut the success of this noble and humane enterprise is yet uncertain.\r\n\r\nI invite your attention to the view of our present naval establishment and\r\nresources presented in the report of the Secretary of the Navy, and the\r\nsuggestions therein made for its improvement, together with the naval\r\npolicy recommended for the security of our Pacific Coast and the protection\r\nand extension of our commerce with eastern Asia. Our facilities for a\r\nlarger participation in the trade of the East, by means of our recent\r\nsettlements on the shores of the Pacific, are too obvious to be overlooked\r\nor disregarded.\r\n\r\nThe questions in relation to rank in the Army and Navy and relative rank\r\nbetween officers of the two branches of the service, presented to the\r\nExecutive by certain resolutions of the House of Representatives at the\r\nlast session of Congress, have been submitted to a board of officers in\r\neach branch of the service, and their report may be expected at an early\r\nday.\r\n\r\nI also earnestly recommend the enactment of a law authorizing officers of\r\nthe Army and Navy to be retired from the service when incompetent for its\r\nvigorous and active duties, taking care to make suitable provision for\r\nthose who have faithfully served their country and awarding distinctions by\r\nretaining in appropriate commands those who have been particularly\r\nconspicuous for gallantry and good conduct. While the obligation of the\r\ncountry to maintain and honor those who, to the exclusion of other\r\npursuits, have devoted themselves to its arduous service is acknowledged,\r\nthis obligation should not be permitted to interfere with the efficiency of\r\nthe service itself.\r\n\r\nI am gratified in being able to state that the estimates of expenditure for\r\nthe Navy in the ensuing year are less by more than $1,000,000 than those of\r\nthe present, excepting the appropriation which may become necessary for the\r\nconstruction of a dock on the coast of the Pacific, propositions for which\r\nare now being considered and on which a special report may be expected\r\nearly in your present session.\r\n\r\nThere is an evident justness in the suggestion of the same report that\r\nappropriations for the naval service proper should be separated from those\r\nfor fixed and permanent objects, such as building docks and navy yards and\r\nthe fixtures attached, and from the extraordinary objects under the care of\r\nthe Department which, however important, are not essentially naval.\r\n\r\nA revision of the code for the government of the Navy seems to require the\r\nimmediate consideration of Congress. Its system of crimes and punishments\r\nhad undergone no change for half a century until the last session, though\r\nits defects have been often and ably pointed out; and the abolition of a\r\nparticular species of corporal punishment, which then took place, without\r\nproviding any substitute, has left the service in a state of defectiveness\r\nwhich calls for prompt correction. I therefore recommend that the whole\r\nsubject be revised without delay and such a system established for the\r\nenforcement of discipline as shall be at once humane and effectual.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying report of the Postmaster-General presents a satisfactory\r\nview of the operations and condition of that Department. At the close of\r\nthe last fiscal year the length of the inland mail routes in the United\r\nStates (not embracing the service in Oregon and California) was 178,672\r\nmiles, the annual transportation thereon 46,541,423 miles, and the annual\r\ncost of such transportation $2,724,426. The increase of the annual\r\ntransportation over that of the preceding year was 3,997,354 miles and the\r\nincrease in cost was $342,440. The number of post-offices in the United\r\nStates on the 1st day of July last was 18,417, being an increase of 1,670\r\nduring the preceding year.\r\n\r\nThe gross revenues of the Department for the fiscal year ending June 30,\r\n1850, amounted to $5,552,971.48, including the annual appropriation of\r\n$200,000 for the franked matter of the Departments and excluding the\r\nforeign postages collected for and payable to the British Government.\r\n\r\nThe expenditures for the same period were $5,212,953.43, leaving a balance\r\nof revenue over expenditures of $340,018.05.\r\n\r\nI am happy to find that the fiscal condition of the Department is such as\r\nto justify the Postmaster-General in recommending the reduction of our\r\ninland letter postage to 3 cents the single letter when prepaid and 5 cents\r\nwhen not prepaid. He also recommends that the prepaid rate shall be reduced\r\nto 2 cents whenever the revenues of the Department, after the reduction,\r\nshall exceed its expenditures by more than 5 per cent for two consecutive\r\nyears; that the postage upon California and other letters sent by our ocean\r\nsteamers shall be much reduced, and that the rates of postage on\r\nnewspapers, pamphlets, periodicals, and other printed matter shall be\r\nmodified and some reduction thereon made.\r\n\r\nIt can not be doubted that the proposed reductions will for the present\r\ndiminish the revenues of the Department. It is believed that the\r\ndeficiency, after the surplus already accumulated shall be exhausted, may\r\nbe almost wholly met either by abolishing the existing privileges of\r\nsending free matter through the mails or by paying out of the Treasury to\r\nthe Post-Office Department a sum equivalent to the postage of which it is\r\ndeprived by such privileges. The last is supposed to be the preferable\r\nmode, and will, if not entirely, so nearly supply that deficiency as to\r\nmake any further appropriation that may be found necessary so\r\ninconsiderable as to form no obstacle to the proposed reductions.\r\n\r\nI entertain no doubt of the authority of Congress to make appropriations\r\nfor leading objects in that class of public works comprising what are\r\nusually called works of internal improvement. This authority I suppose to\r\nbe derived chiefly from the power of regulating commerce with foreign\r\nnations and among the States and the power of laying and collecting\r\nimposts. Where commerce is to be carried on and imposts collected there\r\nmust be ports and harbors as well as wharves and custom-houses. If ships\r\nladen with valuable cargoes approach the shore or sail along the coast,\r\nlight-houses are necessary at suitable points for the protection of life\r\nand property. Other facilities and securities for commerce and navigation\r\nare hardly less important; and those clauses of the Constitution,\r\ntherefore, to which I have referred have received from the origin of the\r\nGovernment a liberal and beneficial construction. Not only have\r\nlight-houses, buoys, and beacons been established and floating lights\r\nmaintained, but harbors have been cleared and improved, piers constructed,\r\nand even breakwaters for the safety of shipping and sea walls to protect\r\nharbors from being filled up and rendered useless by the action of the\r\nocean, have been erected at very great expense. And this construction of\r\nthe Constitution appears the more reasonable from the consideration that if\r\nthese works, of such evident importance and utility, are not to be\r\naccomplished by Congress they can not be accomplished at all. By the\r\nadoption of the Constitution the several States voluntarily parted with the\r\npower of collecting duties of imposts in their own ports, and it is not to\r\nbe expected that they should raise money by internal taxation, direct or\r\nindirect, for the benefit of that commerce the revenues derived from which\r\ndo not, either in whole or in part, go into their own treasuries. Nor do I\r\nperceive any difference between the power of Congress to make\r\nappropriations for objects of this kind on the ocean and the power to make\r\nappropriations for similar objects on lakes and rivers, wherever they are\r\nlarge enough to bear on their waters an extensive traffic. The magnificent\r\nMississippi and its tributaries and the vast lakes of the North and\r\nNorthwest appear to me to fall within the exercise of the power as justly\r\nand as clearly as the ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. It is a mistake to\r\nregard expenditures judiciously made for these objects as expenditures for\r\nlocal purposes. The position or sight of the work is necessarily local, but\r\nits utility is general. A ship canal around the Falls of St. Mary of less\r\nthan a mile in length, though local in its construction, would yet be\r\nnational in its purpose and its benefits, as it would remove the only\r\nobstruction to a navigation of more than 1,000 miles, affecting several\r\nStates, as well as our commercial relations with Canada. So, too, the\r\nbreakwater at the mouth of the Delaware is erected, not for the exclusive\r\nbenefit of the States bordering on the bay and river of that name, but for\r\nthat of the whole coastwise navigation of the United States and, to a\r\nconsiderable extent, also of foreign commerce. If a ship be lost on the bar\r\nat the entrance of a Southern port for want of sufficient depth of water,\r\nit is very likely to be a Northern ship; and if a steamboat be sunk in any\r\npart of the Mississippi on account of its channel not having been properly\r\ncleared of obstructions, it may be a boat belonging to either of eight or\r\nten States. I may add, as somewhat remarkable, that among all the\r\nthirty-one States there is none that is not to a greater or less extent\r\nbounded on the ocean, or the Gulf of Mexico, or one of the Great Lakes, or\r\nsome navigable river.\r\n\r\nIn fulfilling our constitutional duties, fellow-citizens, on this subject,\r\nas in carrying into effect all other powers conferred by the Constitution,\r\nwe should consider ourselves as deliberating and acting for one and the\r\nsame country, and bear constantly in mind that our regard and our duty are\r\ndue not to a particular part only, but to the whole.\r\n\r\nI therefore recommend that appropriations be made for completing such works\r\nas have been already begun and for commencing such others as may seem to\r\nthe wisdom of Congress to be of public and general importance.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties and delays incident to the settlement of private claims by\r\nCongress amount in many cases to a denial of justice. There is reason to\r\napprehend that many unfortunate creditors of the Government have thereby\r\nbeen unavoidably ruined. Congress has so much business of a public\r\ncharacter that it is impossible it should give much attention to mere\r\nprivate claims, and their accumulation is now so great that many claimants\r\nmust despair of ever being able to obtain a hearing. It may well be doubted\r\nwhether Congress, from the nature of its organization, is properly\r\nconstituted to decide upon such cases. It is impossible that each member\r\nshould examine the merits of every claim on which he is compelled to vote,\r\nand it is preposterous to ask a judge to decide a case which he has never\r\nheard. Such decisions may, and frequently must, do injustice either to the\r\nclaimant or the Government, and I perceive no better remedy for this\r\ngrowing evil than the establishment of some tribunal to adjudicate upon\r\nsuch claims. I beg leave, therefore, most respectfully to recommend that\r\nprovision be made by law for the appointment of a commission to settle all\r\nprivate claims against the United States; and as an ex parte hearing must\r\nin all contested cases be very unsatisfactory, I also recommend the\r\nappointment of a solicitor, whose duty it shall be to represent the\r\nGovernment before such commission and protect it against all illegal,\r\nfraudulent, or unjust claims which may be presented for their adjudication.\r\nThis District, which has neither voice nor vote in your deliberations,\r\nlooks to you for protection and aid, and I commend all its wants to your\r\nfavorable consideration, with a full confidence that you will meet them not\r\nonly with justice, but with liberality. It should be borne in mind that in\r\nthis city, laid out by Washington and consecrated by his name, is located\r\nthe Capitol of our nation, the emblem of our Union and the symbol of our\r\ngreatness. Here also are situated all the public buildings necessary for\r\nthe use of the Government, and all these are exempt from taxation. It\r\nshould be the pride of Americans to render this place attractive to the\r\npeople of the whole Republic and convenient and safe for the transaction of\r\nthe public business and the preservation of the public records. The\r\nGovernment should therefore bear a liberal proportion of the burdens of all\r\nnecessary and useful improvements. And as nothing could contribute more to\r\nthe health, comfort, and safety of the city and the security of the public\r\nbuildings and records than an abundant supply of pure water, I respectfully\r\nrecommend that you make such provisions for obtaining the same as in your\r\nwisdom you may deem proper.\r\n\r\nThe act, passed at your last session, making certain propositions to Texas\r\nfor settling the disputed boundary between that State and the Territory of\r\nNew Mexico was, immediately on its passage, transmitted by express to the\r\ngovernor of Texas, to be laid by him before the general assembly for its\r\nagreement thereto. Its receipt was duly acknowledged, but no official\r\ninformation has yet been received of the action of the general assembly\r\nthereon. It may, however, be very soon expected, as, by the terms of the\r\npropositions submitted they were to have been acted upon on or before the\r\nfirst day of the present month.\r\n\r\nIt was hardly to have been expected that the series of measures passed at\r\nyour last session with the view of healing the sectional differences which\r\nhad sprung from the slavery and territorial questions should at once have\r\nrealized their beneficent purpose. All mutual concession in the nature of a\r\ncompromise must necessarily be unwelcome to men of extreme opinions. And\r\nthough without such concessions our Constitution could not have been\r\nformed, and can not be permanently sustained, yet we have seen them made\r\nthe subject of bitter controversy in both sections of the Republic. It\r\nrequired many months of discussion and deliberation to secure the\r\nconcurrence of a majority of Congress in their favor. It would be strange\r\nif they had been received with immediate approbation by people and States\r\nprejudiced and heated by the exciting controversies of their\r\nrepresentatives. I believe those measures to have been required by the\r\ncircumstances and condition of the country. I believe they were necessary\r\nto allay asperities and animosities that were rapidly alienating one\r\nsection of the country from another and destroying those fraternal\r\nsentiments which are the strongest supports of the Constitution. They were\r\nadopted in the spirit of conciliation and for the purpose of conciliation.\r\nI believe that a great majority of our fellow citizens sympathize in that\r\nspirit and that purpose, and in the main approve and are prepared in all\r\nrespects to sustain these enactments. I can not doubt that the American\r\npeople, bound together by kindred blood and common traditions, still\r\ncherish a paramount regard for the Union of their fathers, and that they\r\nare ready to rebuke any attempt to violate its integrity, to disturb the\r\ncompromises on which it is based, or to resist the laws which have been\r\nenacted under its authority.\r\n\r\nThe series of measures to which I have alluded are regarded by me as a\r\nsettlement in principle and substance--a final settlement of the dangerous\r\nand exciting subjects which they embraced. Most of these subjects, indeed,\r\nare beyond your reach, as the legislation which disposed of them was in its\r\ncharacter final and irrevocable. It may be presumed from the opposition\r\nwhich they all encountered that none of those measures was free from\r\nimperfections, but in their mutual dependence and connection they formed a\r\nsystem of compromise the most conciliatory and best for the entire country\r\nthat could be obtained from conflicting sectional interests and opinions.\r\n\r\nFor this reason I recommend your adherence to the adjustment established by\r\nthose measures until time and experience shall demonstrate the necessity of\r\nfurther legislation to guard against evasion or abuse.\r\n\r\nBy that adjustment we have been rescued from the wide and boundless\r\nagitation that surrounded us, and have a firm, distinct, and legal ground\r\nto rest upon. And the occasion, I trust, will justify me in exhorting my\r\ncountrymen to rally upon and maintain that ground as the best, if not the\r\nonly, means of restoring peace and quiet to the country and maintaining\r\ninviolate the integrity of the Union.\r\n\r\nAnd now, fellow-citizens, I can not bring this communication to a close\r\nwithout invoking you to join me in humble and devout thanks to the Great\r\nRuler of Nations for the multiplied blessings which He has graciously\r\nbestowed upon us. His hand, so often visible in our preservation, has\r\nstayed the pestilence, saved us from foreign wars and domestic\r\ndisturbances, and scattered plenty throughout the land.\r\n\r\nOur liberties, religions and civil, have been maintained, the fountains of\r\nknowledge have all been kept open, and means of happiness widely spread and\r\ngenerally enjoyed greater than have fallen to the lot of any other nation.\r\nAnd while deeply penetrated with gratitude for the past, let us hope that\r\nHis all-wise providence will so guide our counsels as that they shall\r\nresult in giving satisfaction to our constituents, securing the peace of\r\nthe country, and adding new strength to the united Government under which\r\nwe live.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nMillard Fillmore\r\nDecember 2, 1851\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nI congratulate you and our common constituency upon the favorable auspices\r\nunder which you meet for your first session. Our country is at peace with\r\nall the world. The agitation which for a time threatened to disturb the\r\nfraternal relations which make us one people is fast subsiding, and a year\r\nof general prosperity and health has crowned the nation with unusual\r\nblessings. None can look back to the dangers which are passed or forward to\r\nthe bright prospect before us without feeling a thrill of gratification, at\r\nthe same time that he must be impressed with a grateful sense of our\r\nprofound obligations to a beneficent Providence, whose paternal care is so\r\nmanifest in the happiness of this highly favored land.\r\n\r\nSince the close of the last Congress certain Cubans and other foreigners\r\nresident in the United States, who were more or less concerned in the\r\nprevious invasion of Cuba, instead of being discouraged by its failure have\r\nagain abused the hospitality of this country by making it the scene of the\r\nequipment of another military expedition against that possession of Her\r\nCatholic Majesty, in which they were countenanced, aided, and joined by\r\ncitizens of the United States. On receiving intelligence that such designs\r\nwere entertained, I lost no time in issuing such instructions to the proper\r\nofficers of the United States as seemed to be called for by the occasion.\r\nBy the proclamation a copy of which is herewith submitted I also warned\r\nthose who might be in danger of being inveigled into this scheme of its\r\nunlawful character and of the penalties which they would incur. For some\r\ntime there was reason to hope that these measures had sufficed to prevent\r\nany such attempt. This hope, however, proved to be delusive. Very early in\r\nthe morning of the 3d of August a steamer called the Pampero departed from\r\nNew Orleans for Cuba, having on board upward of 400 armed men with evident\r\nintentions to make war upon the authorities of the island. This expedition\r\nwas set on foot in palpable violation of the laws of the United States. Its\r\nleader was a Spaniard, and several of the chief officers and some others\r\nengaged in it were foreigners. The persons composing it, however, were\r\nmostly citizens of the United States.\r\n\r\nBefore the expedition set out, and probably before it was organized, a\r\nslight insurrectionary movement, which appears to have been soon\r\nsuppressed, had taken place in the eastern quarter of Cuba. The importance\r\nof this movement was, unfortunately, so much exaggerated in the accounts of\r\nit published in this country that these adventurers seem to have been led\r\nto believe that the Creole population of the island not only desired to\r\nthrow off the authority of the mother country, but had resolved upon that\r\nstep and had begun a well-concerted enterprise for effecting it. The\r\npersons engaged in the expedition were generally young and ill informed.\r\nThe steamer in which they embarked left New Orleans stealthily and without\r\na clearance. After touching at Key West, she proceeded to the coast of\r\nCuba, and on the night between the 11th and 12th of August landed the\r\npersons on board at Playtas, within about 20 leagues of Havana.\r\n\r\nThe main body of them proceeded to and took possession of an inland village\r\n6 leagues distant, leaving others to follow in charge of the baggage as\r\nsoon as the means of transportation could be obtained. The latter, having\r\ntaken up their line of march to connect themselves with the main body, and\r\nhaving proceeded about 4 leagues into the country, were attacked on the\r\nmorning of the 13th by a body of Spanish troops, and a bloody conflict\r\nensued, after which they retreated to the place of disembarkation, where\r\nabout 50 of them obtained boats and reembarked therein. They were, however,\r\nintercepted among the keys near the shore by a Spanish steamer cruising on\r\nthe coast, captured and carried to Havana, and after being examined before\r\na military court were sentenced to be publicly executed, and the sentence\r\nwas carried into effect on the 16th of August.\r\n\r\nOn receiving information of what had occurred Commodore Foxhall A. Parker\r\nwas instructed to proceed in the steam frigate Saranac to Havana and\r\ninquire into the charges against the persons executed, the circumstances\r\nunder which they were taken, and whatsoever referred to their trial and\r\nsentence. Copies of the instructions from the Department of State to him\r\nand of his letters to that Department are herewith submitted.\r\n\r\nAccording to the record of the examination, the prisoners all admitted the\r\noffenses charged against them, of being hostile invaders of the island. At\r\nthe time of their trial and execution the main body of the invaders was\r\nstill in the field making war upon the Spanish authorities and Spanish\r\nsubjects. After the lapse of some days, being overcome by the Spanish\r\ntroops, they dispersed on the 24th of August. Lopez, their leader, was\r\ncaptured some days after, and executed on the 1st of September. Many of his\r\nremaining followers were killed or died of hunger and fatigue, and the rest\r\nwere made prisoners. Of these none appear to have been tried or executed.\r\nSeveral of them were pardoned upon application of their friends and others,\r\nand the rest, about 160 in number, were sent to Spain. Of the final\r\ndisposition made of these we have no official information.\r\n\r\nSuch is the melancholy result of this illegal and ill-fated expedition.\r\nThus thoughtless young men have been induced by false and fraudulent\r\nrepresentations to violate the law of their country through rash and\r\nunfounded expectations of assisting to accomplish political revolutions in\r\nother states, and have lost their lives in the undertaking. Too severe a\r\njudgment can hardly be passed by the indignant sense of the community upon\r\nthose who, being better informed themselves, have yet led away the ardor of\r\nyouth and an ill-directed love of political liberty. The correspondence\r\nbetween this Government and that of Spain relating to this transaction is\r\nherewith communicated.\r\n\r\nAlthough these offenders against the laws have forfeited the protection of\r\ntheir country, yet the Government may, so far as consistent with its\r\nobligations to other countries and its fixed purpose to maintain and\r\nenforce the laws, entertain sympathy for their unoffending families and\r\nfriends, as well as a feeling of compassion for themselves. Accordingly, no\r\nproper effort has been spared and none will be spared to procure the\r\nrelease of such citizens of the United States engaged in this unlawful\r\nenterprise as are now in confinement in Spain; but it is to be hoped that\r\nsuch interposition with the Government of that country may not be\r\nconsidered as affording any ground of expectation that the Government of\r\nthe United States will hereafter feel itself under any obligation of duty\r\nto intercede for the liberation or pardon of such persons as are flagrant\r\noffenders against the law of nations and the laws of the United States.\r\nThese laws must be executed. If we desire to maintain our respectability\r\namong the nations of the earth, it behooves us to enforce steadily and\r\nsternly the neutrality acts passed by Congress and to follow as far as may\r\nbe the violation of those acts with condign punishment.\r\n\r\nBut what gives a peculiar criminality to this invasion of Cuba is that,\r\nunder the lead of Spanish subjects and with the aid of citizens of the\r\nUnited States, it had its origin with many in motives of cupidity. Money\r\nwas advanced by individuals, probably in considerable amounts, to purchase\r\nCuban bonds, as they have been called, issued by Lopez, sold, doubtless, at\r\na very large discount, and for the payment of which the public lands and\r\npublic property of Cuba, of whatever kind, and the fiscal resources of the\r\npeople and government of that island, from whatever source to be derived,\r\nwere pledged, as well as the good faith of the government expected to be\r\nestablished. All these means of payment, it is evident, were only to be\r\nobtained by a process of bloodshed, war, and revolution. None will deny\r\nthat those who set on foot military expeditions against foreign states by\r\nmeans like these are far more culpable than the ignorant and the\r\nnecessitous whom they induce to go forth as the ostensible parties in the\r\nproceeding. These originators of the invasion of Cuba seem to have\r\ndetermined with coolness and system upon an undertaking which should\r\ndisgrace their country, violate its laws, and put to hazard the lives of\r\nill-informed and deluded men. You will consider whether further legislation\r\nbe necessary to prevent the perpetration of such offenses in future.\r\n\r\nNo individuals have a right to hazard the peace of the country or to\r\nviolate its laws upon vague notions of altering or reforming governments in\r\nother states. This principle is not only reasonable in itself and in\r\naccordance with public law, but is ingrafted into the codes of other\r\nnations as well as our own. But while such are the sentiments of this\r\nGovernment, it may be added that every independent nation must be presumed\r\nto be able to defend its possessions against unauthorized individuals\r\nbanded together to attack them. The Government of the United States at all\r\ntimes since its establishment has abstained and has sought to restrain the\r\ncitizens of the country from entering into controversies between other\r\npowers, and to observe all the duties of neutrality. At an early period of\r\nthe Government, in the Administration of Washington, several laws were\r\npassed for this purpose. The main provisions of these laws were reenacted\r\nby the act of April, 1818, by which, amongst other things, it was declared\r\nthat--\r\n\r\nIf any person shall, within the territory or jurisdiction of the United\r\nStates, begin, or set on foot, or provide or prepare the means for, any\r\nmilitary expedition or enterprise to be carried on from thence against the\r\nterritory or dominions of any foreign prince or state, or of any colony,\r\ndistrict, or people, with whom the United States are at peace, every person\r\nso offending shall be deemed guilty of a high misdemeanor, and shall be\r\nfined not exceeding $3,000 and imprisoned not more than three years.\r\n\r\nAnd this law has been executed and enforced to the full extent of the power\r\nof the Government from that day to this.\r\n\r\nIn proclaiming and adhering to the doctrine of neutrality and\r\nnonintervention, the United States have not followed the lead of other\r\ncivilized nations; they have taken the lead themselves and have been\r\nfollowed by others. This was admitted by one of the most eminent of modern\r\nBritish statesmen, who said in Parliament, while a minister of the Crown,\r\n\"that if he wished for a guide in a system of neutrality he should take\r\nthat laid down by America in the days of Washington and the secretaryship\r\nof Jefferson;\" and we see, in fact, that the act of Congress of 1818 was\r\nfollowed the succeeding year by an act of the Parliament of England\r\nsubstantially the same in its general provisions. Up to that time there had\r\nbeen no similar law in England, except certain highly penal statutes passed\r\nin the reign of George II, prohibiting English subjects from enlisting in\r\nforeign service, the avowed object of which statutes was that foreign\r\narmies, raised for the purpose of restoring the house of Stuart to the\r\nthrone, should not be strengthened by recruits from England herself.\r\n\r\nAll must see that difficulties may arise in carrying the laws referred to\r\ninto execution in a country now having 3,000 or 4,000 miles of seacoast,\r\nwith an infinite number of ports and harbors and small inlets, from some of\r\nwhich unlawful expeditious may suddenly set forth, without the knowledge of\r\nGovernment, against the possessions of foreign states.\r\n\r\n\"Friendly relations with all, but entangling alliances with none,\" has long\r\nbeen a maxim with us. Our true mission is not to propagate our opinions or\r\nimpose upon other countries our form of government by artifice or force,\r\nbut to teach by example and show by our success, moderation, and justice\r\nthe blessings of self-government and the advantages of free institutions.\r\nLet every people choose for itself and make and alter its political\r\ninstitutions to suit its own condition and convenience. But while we avow\r\nand maintain this neutral policy ourselves, we are anxious to see the same\r\nforbearance on the part of other nations whose forms of government are\r\ndifferent from our own. The deep interest which we feel in the spread of\r\nliberal principles and the establishment of free governments and the\r\nsympathy with which we witness every struggle against oppression forbid\r\nthat we should be indifferent to a case in which the strong arm of a\r\nforeign power is invoked to stifle public sentiment and repress the spirit\r\nof freedom in any country.\r\n\r\nThe Governments of Great Britain and France have issued orders to their\r\nnaval commanders on the West India station to prevent, by force if\r\nnecessary, the landing of adventurers from any nation on the island of Cuba\r\nwith hostile intent. The copy of a memorandum of a conversation on this\r\nsubject between the charge d'affaires of Her Britannic Majesty and the\r\nActing Secretary of State and of a subsequent note of the former to the\r\nDepartment of State are herewith submitted, together with a copy of a note\r\nof the Acting Secretary of State to the minister of the French Republic and\r\nof the reply of the latter on the same subject. These papers will acquaint\r\nyou with the grounds of this interposition of two leading commercial powers\r\nof Europe, and with the apprehensions, which this Government could not fail\r\nto entertain, that such interposition, if carried into effect, might lead\r\nto abuses in derogation of the maritime rights of the United States. The\r\nmaritime rights of the United States are founded on a firm, secure, and\r\nwell-defined basis; they stand upon the ground of national independence and\r\npublic law, and will be maintained in all their full and just extent. The\r\nprinciple which this Government has heretofore solemnly announced it still\r\nadheres to, and will maintain under all circumstances and at all hazards.\r\nThat principle is that in every regularly documented merchant vessel the\r\ncrew who navigate it and those on board of it will find their protection in\r\nthe flag which is over them. No American ship can be allowed to be visited\r\nor searched for the purpose of ascertaining the character of individuals on\r\nboard, nor can there be allowed any watch by the vessels of any foreign\r\nnation over American vessels on the coast of the United States or the seas\r\nadjacent thereto. It will be seen by the last communication from the\r\nBritish charge d'affaires to the Department of State that he is authorized\r\nto assure the Secretary of State that every care will be taken that in\r\nexecuting the preventive measures against the expeditions which the United\r\nStates Government itself has denounced as not being entitled to the\r\nprotection of any government no interference shall take place with the\r\nlawful commerce of any nation.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the correspondence on this subject herewith submitted,\r\nofficial information has been received at the Department of State of\r\nassurances by the French Government that in the orders given to the French\r\nnaval forces they were expressly instructed, in any operations they might\r\nengage in, to respect the flag of the United States wherever it might\r\nappear, and to commit no act of hostility upon any vessel or armament under\r\nits protection.\r\n\r\nMinisters and consuls of foreign nations are the means and agents of\r\ncommunication between us and those nations, and it is of the utmost\r\nimportance that while residing in the country they should feel a perfect\r\nsecurity so long as they faithfully discharge their respective duties and\r\nare guilty of no violation of our laws. This is the admitted law of nations\r\nand no country has a deeper interest in maintaining it than the United\r\nStates. Our commerce spreads over every sea and visits every clime, and our\r\nministers and consuls are appointed to protect the interests of that\r\ncommerce as well as to guard the peace of the country and maintain the\r\nhonor of its flag. But how can they discharge these duties unless they be\r\nthemselves protected? And if protected it must be by the laws of the\r\ncountry in which they reside. And what is due to our own public\r\nfunctionaries residing in foreign nations is exactly the measure of what is\r\ndue to the functionaries of other governments residing here. As in war the\r\nbearers of flags of truce are sacred, or else wars would be interminable,\r\nso in peace ambassadors, public ministers, and consuls, charged with\r\nfriendly national intercourse, are objects of especial respect and\r\nprotection, each according to the rights belonging to his rank and station.\r\nIn view of these important principles, it is with deep mortification and\r\nregret I announce to you that during the excitement growing out of the\r\nexecutions at Havana the office of Her Catholic Majesty's consul at New\r\nOrleans was assailed by a mob, his property destroyed, the Spanish flag\r\nfound in the office carried off and torn in pieces, and he himself induced\r\nto flee for his personal safety, which he supposed to be in danger. On\r\nreceiving intelligence of these events I forthwith directed the attorney of\r\nthe United States residing at New Orleans to inquire into the facts and the\r\nextent of the pecuniary loss sustained by the consul, with the intention of\r\nlaying them before you, that you might make provision for such indemnity to\r\nhim as a just regard for the honor of the nation and the respect which is\r\ndue to a friendly power might, in your judgment, seem to require. The\r\ncorrespondence upon this subject between the Secretary of State and Her\r\nCatholic Majesty's minister plenipotentiary is herewith transmitted.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence at New Orleans has led me to give my attention to the state\r\nof our laws in regard to foreign ambassadors, ministers, and consuls. I\r\nthink the legislation of the country is deficient in not providing\r\nsufficiently either for the protection or the punishment of consuls. I\r\ntherefore recommend the subject to the consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nYour attention is again invited to the question of reciprocal trade between\r\nthe United States and Canada and other British possessions near our\r\nfrontier. Overtures for a convention upon this subject have been received\r\nfrom Her Britannic Majesty's minister plenipotentiary, but it seems to be\r\nin many respects preferable that the matter should be regulated by\r\nreciprocal legislation. Documents are laid before you showing the terms\r\nwhich the British Government is willing to offer and the measures which it\r\nmay adopt if some arrangement upon this subject shall not be made.\r\n\r\nFrom the accompanying copy of a note from the British legation at\r\nWashington and the reply of the Department of State thereto it will appear\r\nthat Her Britannic Majesty's Government is desirous that a part of the\r\nboundary line between Oregon and the British possessions should be\r\nauthoritatively marked out, and that an intention was expressed to apply to\r\nCongress for an appropriation to defray the expense thereof on the part of\r\nthe United States. Your attention to this subject is accordingly invited\r\nand a proper appropriation recommended. A convention for the adjustment of\r\nclaims of citizens of the United States against Portugal has been concluded\r\nand the ratifications have been exchanged. The first installment of the\r\namount to be paid by Portugal fell due on the 30th of September last and\r\nhas been paid. The President of the French Republic, according to the\r\nprovisions of the convention, has been selected as arbiter in the case of\r\nthe General Armstrong, and has signified that he accepts the trust and the\r\nhigh satisfaction he feels in acting as the common friend of two nations\r\nwith which France is united by sentiments of sincere and lasting amity.\r\n\r\nThe Turkish Government has expressed its thanks for the kind reception\r\ngiven to the Sultan's agent, Amin Bey, on the occasion of his recent visit\r\nto the United States. On the 28th of February last a dispatch was addressed\r\nby the Secretary of State to Mr. Marsh, the American minister at\r\nConstantinople, instructing him to ask of the Turkish Government permission\r\nfor the Hungarians then imprisoned within the dominions of the Sublime\r\nPorte to remove to this country. On the 3d of March last both Houses of\r\nCongress passed a resolution requesting the President to authorize the\r\nemployment of a public vessel to convey to this country Louis Kossuth and\r\nhis associates in captivity. The instruction above referred to was complied\r\nwith, and the Turkish Government having released Governor Kossuth and his\r\ncompanions from prison, on the 10th of September last they embarked on\r\nboard of the United States steam frigate Mississippi, which was selected to\r\ncarry into effect the resolution of Congress. Governor Kossuth left the\r\nMississippi at Gibraltar for the purpose of making a visit to England, and\r\nmay shortly be expected in New York. By communications to the Department of\r\nState he has expressed his grateful acknowledgments for the interposition\r\nof this Government in behalf of himself and his associates. This country\r\nhas been justly regarded as a safe asylum for those whom political events\r\nhave exiled from their own homes in Europe. and it is recommended to\r\nCongress to consider in what manner Governor Kossuth and his companions,\r\nbrought hither by its authority, shall be received and treated.\r\n\r\nIt is earnestly to be hoped that the differences which have for some time\r\npast been pending between the Government of the French Republic and that of\r\nthe Sandwich Islands may be peaceably and durably adjusted so as to secure\r\nthe independence of those islands. Long before the events which have of\r\nlate imparted so much importance to the possessions of the United States on\r\nthe Pacific we acknowledged the independence of the Hawaiian Government.\r\nThis Government was first in taking that step, and several of the leading\r\npowers of Europe immediately followed. We were influenced in this measure\r\nby the existing and prospective importance of the islands as a place of\r\nrefuge and refreshment for our vessels engaged in the whale fishery, and by\r\nthe consideration that they lie in the course of the great trade which must\r\nat no distant day be carried on between the western coast of North America\r\nand eastern Asia.\r\n\r\nWe were also influenced by a desire that those islands should not pass\r\nunder the control of any other great maritime state, but should remain in\r\nan independent condition, and so be accessible and useful to the commerce\r\nof all nations. I need not say that the importance of these considerations\r\nhas been greatly enhanced by the sudden and vast development which the\r\ninterests of the United States have attained in California and Oregon, and\r\nthe policy heretofore adopted in regard to those islands will be steadily\r\npursued.\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying, not only to those who consider the commercial interests\r\nof nations, but also to all who favor the progress of knowledge and the\r\ndiffusion of religion, to see a community emerge from a savage state and\r\nattain such a degree of civilization in those distant seas. It is much to\r\nbe deplored that the internal tranquillity of the Mexican Republic should\r\nagain be seriously disturbed, for since the peace between that Republic and\r\nthe United States it had enjoyed such comparative repose that the most\r\nfavorable anticipations for the future might with a degree of confidence\r\nhave been indulged. These, however, have been thwarted by the recent\r\noutbreak in the State of Tamaulipas, on the right bank of the Rio Bravo.\r\nHaving received information that persons from the United States had taken\r\npart in the insurrection, and apprehending that their example might be\r\nfollowed by others, I caused orders to be issued for the purpose of\r\npreventing any hostile expeditions against Mexico from being set on foot in\r\nviolation of the laws of the United States. I likewise issued a\r\nproclamation upon the subject, a copy of which is herewith laid before you.\r\nThis appeared to be rendered imperative by the obligations of treaties and\r\nthe general duties of good neighborhood.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message I informed Congress that citizens of the United\r\nStates had undertaken the connection of the two oceans by means of a\r\nrailroad across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, under a grant of the Mexican\r\nGovernment to a citizen of that Republic, and that this enterprise would\r\nprobably be prosecuted with energy whenever Mexico should consent to such\r\nstipulations with the Government of the United States as should impart a\r\nfeeling of security to those who should invest their property in the\r\nenterprise. A convention between the two Governments for the accomplishment\r\nof that end has been ratified by this Government, and only awaits the\r\ndecision of the Congress and the Executive of that Republic.\r\n\r\nSome unexpected difficulties and delays have arisen in the ratification of\r\nthat convention by Mexico, but it is to be presumed that her decision will\r\nbe governed by just and enlightened views, as well of the general\r\nimportance of the object as of her own interests and obligations.\r\n\r\nIn negotiating upon this important subject this Government has had in view\r\none, and only one, object. That object has been, and is, the construction\r\nor attainment of a passage from ocean to ocean, the shortest and the best\r\nfor travelers and merchandise, and equally open to all the world. It has\r\nsought to obtain no territorial acquisition, nor any advantages peculiar to\r\nitself; and it would see with the greatest regret that Mexico should oppose\r\nany obstacle to the accomplishment of an enterprise which promises so much\r\nconvenience to the whole commercial world and such eminent advantages to\r\nMexico herself. Impressed with these sentiments and these convictions, the\r\nGovernment will continue to exert all proper efforts to bring about the\r\nnecessary arrangement with the Republic of Mexico for the speedy completion\r\nof the work. For some months past the Republic of Nicaragua has been the\r\ntheater of one of those civil convulsions from which the cause of free\r\ninstitutions and the general prosperity and social progress of the States\r\nof Central America have so often and so severely suffered. Until quiet\r\nshall have been restored and a government apparently stable shall have been\r\norganized, no advance can prudently be made in disposing of the questions\r\npending between the two countries.\r\n\r\nI am happy to announce that an interoceanic communication from the mouth of\r\nthe St. John to the Pacific has been so far accomplished as that passengers\r\nhave actually traversed it and merchandise has been transported over it,\r\nand when the canal shall have been completed according to the original plan\r\nthe means of communication will be further improved. It is understood that\r\na considerable part of the railroad across the Isthmus of Panama has been\r\ncompleted, and that the mail and passengers will in future be conveyed\r\nthereon. Whichever of the several routes between the two oceans may\r\nultimately prove most eligible for travelers to and from the different\r\nStates on the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico and our coast on the Pacific,\r\nthere is little reason to doubt that all of them will be useful to the\r\npublic, and will liberally reward that individual enterprise by which alone\r\nthey have been or are expected to be carried into effect. Peace has been\r\nconcluded between the contending parties in the island of St. Domingo, and,\r\nit is hoped, upon a durable basis. Such is the extent of our commercial\r\nrelations with that island that the United States can not fail to feel a\r\nstrong interest in its tranquillity. The office of commissioner to China\r\nremains unfilled. Several persons have been appointed, and the place has\r\nbeen offered to others, all of whom have declined its acceptance on the\r\nground of the inadequacy of the compensation. The annual allowance by law\r\nis $6,000, and there is no provision for any outfit. I earnestly recommend\r\nthe consideration of this subject to Congress. Our commerce with China is\r\nhighly important, and is becoming more and more so in consequence of the\r\nincreasing intercourse between our ports on the Pacific Coast and eastern\r\nAsia. China is understood to be a country in which living is very\r\nexpensive, and I know of no reason why the American commissioner sent\r\nthither should not be placed, in regard to compensation, on an equal\r\nfooting with ministers who represent this country at the Courts of Europe.\r\n\r\nBy reference to the report of the Secretary of the Treasury it will be seen\r\nthat the aggregate receipts for the last fiscal year amounted to\r\n$52,312,979.87, which, with the balance in the Treasury on the 1st July,\r\n1850, gave as the available means for the year the sum of $58,917,524.36.\r\n\r\nThe total expenditures for the same period were $48,005,878.68. The total\r\nimports for the year ending June 30, 1851, were $215,725,995, of which\r\nthere were in specie $4,967,901. The exports for the same period were\r\n$217,517,130, of which there were of domestic products $178,546,555;\r\nforeign goods reexported, $9,738,695; specie, $29,231,880.\r\n\r\nSince the 1st of December last the payments in cash on account of the\r\npublic debt, exclusive of interest, have amounted to $7,501,456.56, which,\r\nhowever, includes the sum of $3,242,400, paid under the twelfth article of\r\nthe treaty with Mexico, and the further sum of $2,591,213.45, being the\r\namount of awards to American citizens under the late treaty with Mexico,\r\nfor which the issue of stock was authorized, but which was paid in cash\r\nfrom the Treasury.\r\n\r\nThe public debt on the 20th ultimo, exclusive of the stock authorized to be\r\nissued to Texas by the act of 9th September, 1850, was $62,560,395.26.\r\n\r\nThe receipts for the next fiscal year are estimated at $51,800,000, which,\r\nwith the probable unappropriated balance in the Treasury on the 30th June\r\nnext, will give as the probable available means for that year the sum of\r\n$63,258,743.09.\r\n\r\nIt has been deemed proper, in view of the large expenditures consequent\r\nupon the acquisition of territory from Mexico, that the estimates for the\r\nnext fiscal year should be laid before Congress in such manner as to\r\ndistinguish the expenditures so required from the otherwise ordinary\r\ndemands upon the Treasury.\r\n\r\nThe total expenditures for the next fiscal year are estimated at\r\n$42,892,299.19, of which there is required for the ordinary purposes of the\r\nGovernment, other than those consequent upon the acquisition of our new\r\nterritories, and deducting the payments on account of the public debt, the\r\nsum of $33,343,198.08, and for the purposes connected, directly or\r\nindirectly, with those territories and in the fulfillment of the\r\nobligations of the Government contracted in consequence of their\r\nacquisition the sum of $9,549,101.11.\r\n\r\nIf the views of the Secretary of the Treasury in reference to the\r\nexpenditures required for these territories shall be met by corresponding\r\naction on the part of Congress, and appropriations made in accordance\r\ntherewith, there will be an estimated unappropriated balance in the\r\nTreasury on the 30th June, 1853, of $20,366,443.90 wherewith to meet that\r\nportion of the public debt due on the 1st of July following, amounting to\r\n$6,237,931.35, as well as any appropriations which may be made beyond the\r\nestimates.\r\n\r\nIn thus referring to the estimated expenditures on account of our newly\r\nacquired territories, I may express the hope that Congress will concur with\r\nme in the desire that a liberal course of policy may be pursued toward\r\nthem, and that every obligation, express or implied, entered into in\r\nconsequence of their acquisition shall be fulfilled by the most liberal\r\nappropriations for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThe values of our domestic exports for the last fiscal year, as compared\r\nwith those of the previous year, exhibit an increase of $43,646,322. At\r\nfirst view this condition of our trade with foreign nations would seem to\r\npresent the most flattering hopes of its future prosperity. An examination\r\nof the details of our exports, however, will show that the increased value\r\nof our exports for the last fiscal year is to be found in the high price of\r\ncotton which prevailed during the first half of that year, which price has\r\nsince declined about one-half.\r\n\r\nThe value of our exports of breadstuffs and provisions, which it was\r\nsupposed the incentive of a low tariff and large importations from abroad\r\nwould have greatly augmented, has fallen from $68,701,921 in 1847 to\r\n$26,051,373 in 1850 and to $21,948,653 in 1851, with a strong probability,\r\namounting almost to a certainty, of a still further reduction in the\r\ncurrent year.\r\n\r\nThe aggregate values of rice exported during the last fiscal year, as\r\ncompared with the previous year, also exhibit a decrease, amounting to\r\n$460,917, which, with a decline in the values of the exports of tobacco for\r\nthe same period, make an aggregate decrease in these two articles of\r\n$1,156,751.\r\n\r\nThe policy which dictated a low rate of duties on foreign merchandise, it\r\nwas thought by those who promoted and established it, would tend to benefit\r\nthe farming population of this country by increasing the demand and raising\r\nthe price of agricultural products in foreign markets.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing facts, however, seem to show incontestably that no such\r\nresult has followed the adoption of this policy. On the contrary,\r\nnotwithstanding the repeal of the restrictive corn laws in England, the\r\nforeign demand for the products of the American farmer has steadily\r\ndeclined, since the short crops and consequent famine in a portion of\r\nEurope have been happily replaced by full crops and comparative abundance\r\nof food.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen by recurring to the commercial statistics for the past year\r\nthat the value of our domestic exports has been increased in the single\r\nitem of raw cotton by $40,000,000 over the value of that export for the\r\nyear preceding. This is not due to any increased general demand for that\r\narticle, but to the short crop of the preceding year, which created an\r\nincreased demand and an augmented price for the crop of last year. Should\r\nthe cotton crop now going forward to market be only equal in quantity to\r\nthat of the year preceding and be sold at the present prices, then there\r\nwould be a falling off in the value of our exports for the present fiscal\r\nyear of at least $40,000,000 compared with the amount exported for the year\r\nending 30th June, 1851.\r\n\r\nThe production of gold in California for the past year seems to promise a\r\nlarge supply of that metal from that quarter for some time to come. This\r\nlarge annual increase of the currency of the world must be attended with\r\nits usual results. These have been already partially disclosed in the\r\nenhancement of prices and a rising spirit of speculation and adventure,\r\ntending to overtrading, as well at home as abroad. Unless some salutary\r\ncheck shall be given to these tendencies it is to be feared that\r\nimportations of foreign goods beyond a healthy demand in this country will\r\nlead to a sudden drain of the precious metals from us, bringing with it, as\r\nit has done in former times, the most disastrous consequences to the\r\nbusiness and capital of the American people.\r\n\r\nThe exports of specie to liquidate our foreign debt during the past fiscal\r\nyear have been $24,963,979 over the amount of specie imported. The exports\r\nof specie during the first quarter of the present fiscal year have been\r\n$14,651,827. Should specie continue to be exported at this rate for the\r\nremaining three quarters of this year, it will drain from our metallic\r\ncurrency during the year ending 30th June, 1852, the enormous amount of\r\n$58,607,308.\r\n\r\nIn the present prosperous condition of the national finances it will become\r\nthe duty of Congress to consider the best mode of paying off the public\r\ndebt. If the present and anticipated surplus in the Treasury should not be\r\nabsorbed by appropriations of an extraordinary character, this surplus\r\nshould be employed in such way and under such restrictions as Congress may\r\nenact in extinguishing the outstanding debt of the nation.\r\n\r\nBy reference to the act of Congress approved 9th September, 1850, it will\r\nbe seen that, in consideration of certain concessions by the State of\r\nTexas, it is provided that--\r\n\r\nThe United States shall pay to the State of Texas the sum of $10,000,000 in\r\na stock bearing 5 per cent interest and redeemable at the end of fourteen\r\nyears, the interest payable half-yearly at the Treasury of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nIn the same section of the law it is further provided--\r\n\r\nThat no more than five millions of said stock shall be issued until the\r\ncreditors of the State holding bonds and other certificates of stock of\r\nTexas, for which duties on imports were specially pledged, shall first file\r\nat the Treasury of the United States releases of all claims against the\r\nUnited States for or on account of said bonds or certificates, in such form\r\nas shall be prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury and approved by the\r\nPresident of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe form of release thus provided for has been prescribed by the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury and approved. It has been published in all the leading\r\nnewspapers in the commercial cities of the United States, and all persons\r\nholding claims of the kind specified in the foregoing proviso were required\r\nto file their releases (in the form thus prescribed) in the Treasury of the\r\nUnited States on or before the 1st day of October, 1851. Although this\r\npublication has been continued from the 25th day of March, 1851, yet up to\r\nthe 1st of October last comparatively few releases had been filed by the\r\ncreditors of Texas.\r\n\r\nThe authorities of the State of Texas, at the request of the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury, have furnished a schedule of the public debt of that State\r\ncreated prior to her admission into the Union, with a copy of the laws\r\nunder which each class was contracted. I have, from the documents furnished\r\nby the State of Texas, determined the classes of claims which in my\r\njudgment fall within the provisions of the act of Congress of the 9th of\r\nSeptember, 1850.\r\n\r\nOn being officially informed of the acceptance by Texas of the propositions\r\ncontained in the act referred to I caused the stock to be prepared, and the\r\nfive millions which are to be issued unconditionally, bearing an interest\r\nof 5 per cent from the 1st day of January, 1851, have been for some time\r\nready to be delivered to the State of Texas. The authorities of Texas up to\r\nthe present time have not authorized anyone to receive this stock, and it\r\nremains in the Treasury Department subject to the order of Texas. The\r\nreleases required by law to be deposited in the Treasury not having been\r\nfiled there, the remaining five millions have not been issued. This last\r\namount of the stock will be withheld from Texas until the conditions upon\r\nwhich it is to be delivered shall be complied with by the creditors of that\r\nState, unless Congress shall otherwise direct by a modification of the\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message, to which I respectfully refer, I stated briefly\r\nthe reasons which induced me to recommend a modification of the present\r\ntariff by converting the ad valorem into a specific duty wherever the\r\narticle imported was of such a character as to permit it, and that such a\r\ndiscrimination should be made in favor of the industrial pursuits of our\r\nown country as to encourage home production without excluding foreign\r\ncompetition.\r\n\r\nThe numerous frauds which continue to be practiced upon the revenue by\r\nfalse invoices and undervaluations constitute an unanswerable reason for\r\nadopting specific instead of ad valorem duties in all cases where the\r\nnature of the commodity does not forbid it. A striking illustration of\r\nthese frauds will be exhibited in the report of the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, showing the custom-house valuation of articles imported under a\r\nformer law, subject to specific duties, when there was no inducement to\r\nundervaluation, and the custom-house valuations of the same articles under\r\nthe present system of ad valorem duties, so greatly reduced as to leave no\r\ndoubt of the existence of the most flagrant abuses under the existing laws.\r\nThis practical evasion of the present law, combined with the languishing\r\ncondition of some of the great interests of the country, caused by over\r\nimportations and consequent depressed prices, and with the failure in\r\nobtaining a foreign market for our increasing surplus of breadstuffs and\r\nprovisions, has induced me again to recommend a modification of the\r\nexisting tariff. The report of the Secretary of the Interior, which\r\naccompanies this communication, will present a condensed statement of the\r\noperations of that important Department of the Government.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the cash sales of the public lands exceed those of the\r\npreceding year, and that there is reason to anticipate a still further\r\nincrease, notwithstanding the large donations which have been made to many\r\nof the States and the liberal grants to individuals as a reward for\r\nmilitary services. This fact furnishes very gratifying evidence of the\r\ngrowing wealth and prosperity of our country.\r\n\r\nSuitable measures have been adopted for commencing the survey of the public\r\nlands in California and Oregon. Surveying parties have been organized and\r\nsome progress has been made in establishing the principal base and meridian\r\nlines. But further legislation and additional appropriations will be\r\nnecessary before the proper subdivisions can be made and the general land\r\nsystem extended over those remote parts of our territory.\r\n\r\nOn the 3d of March last an act was passed providing for the appointment of\r\nthree commissioners to settle private land claims in California. Three\r\npersons were immediately appointed, all of whom, however, declined\r\naccepting the office in consequence of the inadequacy of the compensation.\r\nOthers were promptly selected, who for the same reason also declined, and\r\nit was not until late in the season that the services of suitable persons\r\ncould be secured. A majority of the commissioners convened in this city on\r\nthe 10th of September last, when detailed instructions were given to them\r\nin regard to their duties. Their first meeting for the transaction of\r\nbusiness will be held in San Francisco on the 8th day of the present\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\nI have thought it proper to refer to these facts, not only to explain the\r\ncauses of the delay in filling the commission, but to call your attention\r\nto the propriety of increasing the compensation of the commissioners. The\r\noffice is one of great labor and responsibility, and the compensation\r\nshould be such as to command men of a high order of talents and the most\r\nunquestionable integrity.\r\n\r\nThe proper disposal of the mineral lands of California is a subject\r\nsurrounded by great difficulties. In my last annual message I recommended\r\nthe survey and sale of them in small parcels under such restrictions as\r\nwould effectually guard against monopoly and speculation; but upon further\r\ninformation, and in deference to the opinions of persons familiar with the\r\nsubject, I am inclined to change that recommendation and to advise that\r\nthey be permitted to remain as at present, a common field, open to the\r\nenterprise and industry of all our citizens, until further experience shall\r\nhave developed the best policy to be ultimately adopted in regard to them.\r\nIt is safer to suffer the inconveniences that now exist for a short period\r\nthan by premature legislation to fasten on the country a system founded in\r\nerror, which may place the whole subject beyond the future control of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural lands should, however, be surveyed and brought into market\r\nwith as little delay as possible, that the titles may become settled and\r\nthe inhabitants stimulated to make permanent improvements and enter on the\r\nordinary pursuits of life. To effect these objects it is desirable that the\r\nnecessary provision be made by law for the establishment of land offices in\r\nCalifornia and Oregon and for the efficient prosecution of the surveys at\r\nan early day.\r\n\r\nSome difficulties have occurred in organizing the Territorial governments\r\nof New Mexico and Utah, and when more accurate information shall be\r\nobtained of the causes a further communication will be made on that\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual communication to Congress I recommended the establishment\r\nof an agricultural bureau, and I take this occasion again to invoke your\r\nfavorable consideration of the subject.\r\n\r\nAgriculture may justly be regarded as the great interest of our people.\r\nFour-fifths of our active population are employed in the cultivation of the\r\nsoil, and the rapid expansion of our settlements over new territory is\r\ndaily adding to the number of those engaged in that vocation. Justice and\r\nsound policy, therefore, alike require that the Government should use all\r\nthe means authorized by the Constitution to promote the interests and\r\nwelfare of that important class of our fellow-citizens. And yet it is a\r\nsingular fact that whilst the manufacturing and commercial interests have\r\nengaged the attention of Congress during a large portion of every session\r\nand our statutes abound in provisions for their protection and\r\nencouragement, little has yet been done directly for the advancement of\r\nagriculture. It is time that this reproach to our legislation should be\r\nremoved, and I sincerely hope that the present Congress will not close\r\ntheir labors without adopting efficient means to supply the omissions of\r\nthose who have preceded them.\r\n\r\nAn agricultural bureau, charged with the duty of collecting and\r\ndisseminating correct information as to the best modes of cultivation and\r\nof the most effectual means of preserving and restoring the fertility of\r\nthe soil and of procuring and distributing seeds and plants and other\r\nvegetable productions, with instructions in regard to the soil, climate,\r\nand treatment best adapted to their growth, could not fail to be, in the\r\nlanguage of Washington in his last annual message to Congress, a \"very\r\ncheap instrument of immense national benefit.\"\r\n\r\nRegarding the act of Congress approved 28th September, 1850, granting\r\nbounty lands to persons who had been engaged in the military service of the\r\ncountry, as a great measure of national justice and munificence, an anxious\r\ndesire has been felt by the officers intrusted with its immediate execution\r\nto give prompt effect to its provisions. All the means within their control\r\nwere therefore brought into requisition to expedite the adjudication of\r\nclaims, and I am gratified to be able to state that near 100,000\r\napplications have been considered and about 70,000 warrants issued within\r\nthe short space of nine months. If adequate provision be made by law to\r\ncarry into effect the recommendations of the Department, it is confidently\r\nexpected that before the close of the next fiscal year all who are entitled\r\nto the benefits of the act will have received their warrants.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Interior has suggested in his report various\r\namendments of the laws relating to pensions and bounty lands for the\r\npurpose of more effectually guarding against abuses and frauds on the\r\nGovernment, to all of which I invite your particular attention. The large\r\naccessions to our Indian population consequent upon the acquisition of New\r\nMexico and California and the extension of our settlements into Utah and\r\nOregon have given increased interest and importance to our relations with\r\nthe aboriginal race. No material change has taken place within the last\r\nyear in the condition and prospects of the Indian tribes who reside in the\r\nNorthwestern Territory and west of the Mississippi River. We are at peace\r\nwith all of them, and it will be a source of pleasure to you to learn that\r\nthey are gradually advancing in civilization and the pursuits of social\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nAlong the Mexican frontier and in California and Oregon there have been\r\noccasional manifestations of unfriendly feeling and some depredations\r\ncommitted. I am satisfied, however, that they resulted more from the\r\ndestitute and starving condition of the Indians than from any settled\r\nhostility toward the whites. As the settlements of our citizens progress\r\ntoward them, the game, upon which they mainly rely for subsistence, is\r\ndriven off or destroyed, and the only alternative left to them is\r\nstarvation or plunder. It becomes us to consider, in view of this condition\r\nof things, whether justice and humanity, as well as an enlightened economy,\r\ndo not require that instead of seeking to punish them for offenses which\r\nare the result of our own policy toward them we should not provide for\r\ntheir immediate wants and encourage them to engage in agriculture and to\r\nrely on their labor instead of the chase for the means of support.\r\n\r\nVarious important treaties have been negotiated with different tribes\r\nduring the year, by which their title to large and valuable tracts of\r\ncountry has been extinguished, all of which will at the proper time be\r\nsubmitted to the Senate for ratification.\r\n\r\nThe joint commission under the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo has been\r\nactively engaged in running and marking the boundary line between the\r\nUnited States and Mexico. It was stated in the last annual report of the\r\nSecretary of the Interior that the initial point on the Pacific and the\r\npoint of junction of the Gila with the Colorado River had been determined\r\nand the intervening line, about 150 miles in length, run and marked by\r\ntemporary monuments. Since that time a monument of marble has been erected\r\nat the initial point, and permanent landmarks of iron have been placed at\r\nsuitable distances along the line.\r\n\r\nThe initial point on the Rio Grande has also been fixed by the\r\ncommissioners, at latitude 32 degrees 22', and at the date of the last\r\ncommunication the survey of the line had been made thence westward about\r\n150 miles to the neighborhood of the copper mines. The commission on our\r\npart was at first organized on a scale which experience proved to be\r\nunwieldy and attended with unnecessary expense. Orders have therefore been\r\nissued for the reduction of the number of persons employed within the\r\nsmallest limits consistent with the safety of those engaged in the service\r\nand the prompt and efficient execution of their important duties.\r\n\r\nReturns have been received from all the officers engaged in taking the\r\ncensus in the States and Territories except California. The superintendent\r\nemployed to make the enumeration in that State has not yet made his full\r\nreport, from causes, as he alleges, beyond his control. This failure is\r\nmuch to be regretted, as it has prevented the Secretary of the Interior\r\nfrom making the decennial apportionment of Representatives among the\r\nStates, as required by the act approved May 23, 1850. It is hoped, however,\r\nthat the returns will soon be received, and no time will then be lost in\r\nmaking the necessary apportionment and in transmitting the certificates\r\nrequired by law.\r\n\r\nThe Superintendent of the Seventh Census is diligently employed, under the\r\ndirection of the Secretary of the Interior, in classifying and arranging in\r\ntabular form all the statistical information derived from the returns of\r\nthe marshals, and it is believed that when the work shall be completed it\r\nwill exhibit a more perfect view of the population, wealth, occupations,\r\nand social condition of a great country than has ever been presented to the\r\nworld. The value of such a work as the basis of enlightened legislation can\r\nhardly be overestimated, and I earnestly hope that Congress will lose no\r\ntime in making the appropriations necessary to complete the classifications\r\nand to publish the results in a style worthy of the subject and of our\r\nnational character.\r\n\r\nThe want of a uniform fee bill, prescribing the compensation to be allowed\r\ndistrict attorneys, clerks, marshals, and commissioners in civil and\r\ncriminal cases, is the cause of much vexation, injustice, and complaint. I\r\nwould recommend a thorough revision of the laws on the whole subject and\r\nthe adoption of a tariff of fees which, as far as practicable, should be\r\nuniform, and prescribe a specific compensation for every service which the\r\nofficer may be required to perform. This subject will be fully presented in\r\nthe report of the Secretary of the Interior. In my last annual message I\r\ngave briefly my reasons for believing that you possessed the constitutional\r\npower to improve the harbors of our Great Lakes and seacoast and the\r\nnavigation of our principal rivers, and recommended that appropriations\r\nshould be made for completing such works as had already been commenced and\r\nfor commencing such others as might seem to the wisdom of Congress to be of\r\npublic and general importance. Without repeating the reasons then urged, I\r\ndeem it my duty again to call your attention to this important subject. The\r\nworks on many of the harbors were left in an unfinished state, and\r\nconsequently exposed to the action of the elements, which is fast\r\ndestroying them. Great numbers of lives and vast amounts of property are\r\nannually lost for want of safe and convenient harbors on the Lakes. None\r\nbut those who have been exposed to that dangerous navigation can fully\r\nappreciate the importance of this subject. The whole Northwest appeals to\r\nyou for relief, and I trust their appeal will receive due consideration at\r\nyour hands.\r\n\r\nThe same is in a measure true in regard to some of the harbors and inlets\r\non the seacoast.\r\n\r\nThe unobstructed navigation of our large rivers is of equal importance. Our\r\nsettlements are now extending to the sources of the great rivers which\r\nempty into and form a part of the Mississippi, and the value of the public\r\nlands in those regions would be greatly enhanced by freeing the navigation\r\nof those waters from obstructions. In view, therefore, of this great\r\ninterest, I deem it my duty again to urge upon Congress to make such\r\nappropriations for these improvements as they may deem necessary.\r\n\r\nThe surveys of the Delta of the Mississippi, with a view to the prevention\r\nof the overflows that have proved so disastrous to that region of country,\r\nhave been nearly completed, and the reports thereof are now in course of\r\npreparation and will shortly be laid before you.\r\n\r\nThe protection of our southwestern frontier and of the adjacent Mexican\r\nStates against the Indian tribes within our border has claimed my earnest\r\nand constant attention. Congress having failed at the last session to adopt\r\nmy recommendation that an additional regiment of mounted men specially\r\nadapted to that service should be raised, all that remained to be done was\r\nto make the best use of the means at my disposal. Accordingly, all the\r\ntroops adapted to that service that could properly be spared from other\r\nquarters have been concentrated on that frontier and officers of high\r\nreputation selected to command them. A new arrangement of the military\r\nposts has also been made, whereby the troops are brought nearer to the\r\nMexican frontier and to the tribes they are intended to overawe.\r\n\r\nSufficient time has not yet elapsed to realize all the benefits that are\r\nexpected to result from these arrangements, but I have every reason to hope\r\nthat they will effectually check their marauding expeditions. The nature of\r\nthe country, which furnishes little for the support of an army and abounds\r\nin places of refuge and concealment, is remarkably well adapted to this\r\npredatory warfare, and we can scarcely hope that any military force,\r\ncombined with the greatest vigilance, can entirely suppress it.\r\n\r\nBy the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo we are bound to protect the territory of\r\nMexico against the incursions of the savage tribes within our border \"with\r\nequal diligence and energy\" as if the same were made within our territory\r\nor against our citizens. I have endeavored to comply as far as possible\r\nwith this provision of the treaty. Orders have been given to the officers\r\ncommanding on that frontier to consider the Mexican territory and its\r\ninhabitants as equally with our own entitled to their protection, and to\r\nmake all their plans and arrangements with a view to the attainment of this\r\nobject. Instructions have also been given to the Indian commissioners and\r\nagents among these tribes in all treaties to make the clauses designed for\r\nthe protection of our own citizens apply also to those of Mexico. I have no\r\nreason to doubt that these instructions have been fully carried into\r\neffect; nevertheless, it is probable that in spite of all our efforts some\r\nof the neighboring States of Mexico may have suffered, as our own have,\r\nfrom depredations by the Indians.\r\n\r\nTo the difficulties of defending our own territory, as above mentioned, are\r\nsuperadded, in defending that of Mexico, those that arise from its\r\nremoteness, from the fact that we have no right to station our troops\r\nwithin her limits and that there is no efficient military force on the\r\nMexican side to cooperate with our own.\r\n\r\nSo long as this shall continue to be the case the number and activity of\r\nour troops will rather increase than diminish the evil, as the Indians will\r\nnaturally turn toward that country where they encounter the least\r\nresistance. Yet these troops are necessary to subdue them and to compel\r\nthem to make and observe treaties. Until this shall have been done neither\r\ncountry will enjoy any security from their attacks.\r\n\r\nThe Indians in California, who had previously appeared of a peaceable\r\ncharacter and disposed to cultivate the friendship of the whites, have\r\nrecently committed several acts of hostility. As a large portion of the\r\nreenforcements sent to the Mexican frontier were drawn from the Pacific,\r\nthe military force now stationed there is considered entirely inadequate to\r\nits defense. It can not be increased, however, without an increase of the\r\nArmy, and I again recommend that measure as indispensable to the protection\r\nof the frontier.\r\n\r\nI invite your attention to the suggestions on this subject and on others\r\nconnected with his Department in the report of the Secretary of War. The\r\nappropriations for the support of the Army during the current fiscal year\r\nending 30th June next were reduced far below the estimate submitted by the\r\nDepartment. The consequence of this reduction is a considerable deficiency,\r\nto which I invite your early attention. The expenditures of that Department\r\nfor the year ending 30th June last were $9,060,268.58, The estimates for\r\nthe year commencing 1st July next and ending June 30, 1853, are\r\n$7,898,775.83, showing a reductions of $1,161,492.75, The board of\r\ncommissioners to whom the management of the affairs of the military asylum\r\ncreated by the act of 3d March last was intrusted have selected a site for\r\nthe establishment of an asylum in the vicinity of this city, which has been\r\napproved by me subject to the production of a satisfactory title.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Navy will exhibit the condition of the\r\npublic service under the supervision of that Department. Our naval force\r\nafloat during the present year has been actively and usefully employed in\r\ngiving protection to our widely extended and increasing commerce and\r\ninterests in the various quarters of the globe, and our flag has everywhere\r\nafforded the security and received the respect inspired by the justice and\r\nliberality of our intercourse and the dignity and power of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe expedition commanded by Lieutenant De Haven, dispatched in search of\r\nthe British commander Sir John Franklin and his companions in the Arctic\r\nSeas, returned to New York in the month of October, after having undergone\r\ngreat peril and suffering from an unknown and dangerous navigation and the\r\nrigors of a northern climate, without any satisfactory information of the\r\nobjects of their search, but with new contributions to science and\r\nnavigation from the unfrequented polar regions. The officers and men of the\r\nexpedition having been all volunteers for this service and having so\r\nconducted it as to meet the entire approbation of the Government, it is\r\nsuggested, as an act of grace and generosity, that the same allowance of\r\nextra pay and emoluments be extended to them that were made to the officers\r\nand men of like rating in the late exploring expedition to the South Seas.\r\n\r\nI earnestly recommend to your attention the necessity of reorganizing the\r\nnaval establishment, apportioning and fixing the number of officers in each\r\ngrade, providing some mode of promotion to the higher grades of the Navy\r\nhaving reference to merit and capacity rather than seniority or date of\r\nentry into the service, and for retiring from the effective list upon\r\nreduced pay those who may be incompetent to the performance of active duty.\r\nAs a measure of economy, as well as of efficiency, in this arm of the\r\nservice, the provision last mentioned is eminently worthy of your\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nThe determination of the questions of relative rank between the sea\r\nofficers and civil officers of the Navy, and between officers of the Army\r\nand Navy, in the various grades of each, will also merit your attention.\r\nThe failure to provide any substitute when corporal punishment was\r\nabolished for offenses in the Navy has occasioned the convening of numerous\r\ncourts-martial upon the arrival of vessels in port, and is believed to have\r\nhad an injurious effect upon the discipline and efficiency of the service.\r\nTo moderate punishment from one grade to another is among the humane\r\nreforms of the age, but to abolish one of severity, which applied so\r\ngenerally to offenses on shipboard, and provide nothing in its stead is to\r\nsuppose a progress of improvement in every individual among seamen which is\r\nnot assumed by the Legislature in respect to any other class of men. It is\r\nhoped that Congress, in the ample opportunity afforded by the present\r\nsession, will thoroughly investigate this important subject, and establish\r\nsuch modes of determining guilt and such gradations of punishment as are\r\nconsistent with humanity and the personal rights of individuals, and at the\r\nsame time shall insure the most energetic and efficient performance of duty\r\nand the suppression of crime in our ships of war.\r\n\r\nThe stone dock in the navy-yard at New York, which was ten years in process\r\nof construction, has been so far finished as to be surrendered up to the\r\nauthorities of the yard. The dry dock at Philadelphia is reported as\r\ncompleted, and is expected soon to be tested and delivered over to the\r\nagents of the Government. That at Portsmouth, N. H., is also nearly ready\r\nfor delivery; and a contract has been concluded, agreeably to the act of\r\nCongress at its last session, for a floating sectional dock on the Bay of\r\nSan Francisco. I invite your attention to the recommendation of the\r\nDepartment touching the establishment of a navy-yard in conjunction with\r\nthis dock on the Pacific. Such a station is highly necessary to the\r\nconvenience and effectiveness of our fleet in that ocean, which must be\r\nexpected to increase with the growth of commerce and the rapid extension of\r\nour whale fisheries over its waters.\r\n\r\nThe Naval Academy at Annapolis, under a revised and improved system of\r\nregulations, now affords opportunities of education and instruction to the\r\npupils quite equal, it is believed, for professional improvement, to those\r\nenjoyed by the cadets in the Military Academy. A large class of acting\r\nmidshipmen was received at the commencement of the last academic term, and\r\na practice ship has been attached to the institution to afford the amplest\r\nmeans for regular instruction in seamanship, as well as for cruises during\r\nthe vacations of three or four months in each year.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of science in nautical affairs have rarely been more\r\nstrikingly illustrated than in the fact, stated in the report of the Navy\r\nDepartment, that by means of the wind and current charts projected and\r\nprepared by Lieutenant Maury, the Superintendent of the Naval Observatory,\r\nthe passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific ports of our country has been\r\nshortened by about forty days.\r\n\r\nThe estimates for the support of the Navy and Marine Corps the ensuing\r\nfiscal year will be found to be $5,856,472.19, the estimates for the\r\ncurrent year being $5,900,621.\r\n\r\nThe estimates for special objects under the control of this Department\r\namount to $2,684,220.89, against $2,210,980 for the present year, the\r\nincrease being occasioned by the additional mail service on the Pacific\r\nCoast and the construction of the dock in California, authorized at the\r\nlast session of Congress, and some slight additions under the head of\r\nimprovements and repairs in navy-yards, buildings, and machinery. I deem it\r\nof much importance to a just economy and a correct understanding of naval\r\nexpenditures that there should be an entire separation of the\r\nappropriations for the support of the naval service proper from those for\r\npermanent improvements at navy-yards and stations and from ocean steam mail\r\nservice and other special objects assigned to the supervision of this\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster-General, herewith communicated, presents an\r\ninteresting view of the progress, operations, and condition of his\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the last fiscal year the length of mail routes within the\r\nUnited States was 196,290 miles, the annual transportation thereon\r\n53,272,252 miles, and the annual cost of such transportation $3,421,754.\r\n\r\nThe length of the foreign mail routes is estimated at 18,349 miles and the\r\nannual transportation thereon at 615,206 miles. The annual cost of this\r\nservice is $1,472,187, of which $448,937 are paid by the Post-Office\r\nDepartment and $1,023,250 are paid through the Navy Department.\r\n\r\nThe annual transportation within the United States, excluding the service\r\nin California and Oregon, which is now for the first time reported and\r\nembraced in the tabular statements of the Department, exceeds that of the\r\npreceding year 6,162,855 miles, at an increased cost of $547,110.\r\n\r\nThe whole number of post-offices in the United States on the 30th day of\r\nJune last was 19,796. There were 1,698 post-offices established and 256\r\ndiscontinued during the year.\r\n\r\nThe gross revenues of the Department for the fiscal year, including the\r\nappropriations for the franked matter of Congress, of the Departments, and\r\nofficers of Government, and excluding the foreign postages collected for\r\nand payable to the British post-office, amounted to $6,727,866.78.\r\n\r\nThe expenditures for the same period, excluding $20,599.49, paid under an\r\naward of the Auditor, in pursuance of a resolution of the last Congress,\r\nfor mail service on the Ohio and Mississippi rivers in 1832 and 1833, and\r\nthe amount paid to the British post-office for foreign postages collected\r\nfor and payable to that office, amounted to $6,024,566.79, leaving a\r\nbalance of revenue over the proper expenditures of the year of\r\n$703,299.99.\r\n\r\nThe receipts for postages during the year, excluding the foreign postages\r\ncollected for and payable to the British post-office, amounted to\r\n$6,345,747.21, being an increase of $997,610.79, or 18.65 per cent, over\r\nthe like receipts for the preceding year.\r\n\r\nThe reduction of postage under the act of March last did not take effect\r\nuntil the commencement of the present fiscal year. The accounts for the\r\nfirst quarter under the operation of the reduced rates will not be settled\r\nbefore January next, and no reliable estimate of the receipts for the\r\npresent year can yet be made. It is believed, however, that they will fall\r\nfar short of those of the last year. The surplus of the revenues now on\r\nhand is, however, so large that no further appropriation from the Treasury\r\nin aid of the revenues of the Department is required for the current fiscal\r\nyear, but an additional appropriation for the year ending June 30, 1853,\r\nwill probably be found necessary when the receipts of the first two\r\nquarters of the fiscal year are fully ascertained.\r\n\r\nIn his last annual report the Postmaster-General recommended a reduction of\r\npostage to rates which he deemed as low as could be prudently adopted\r\nunless Congress was prepared to appropriate from the Treasury for the\r\nsupport of the Department a sum more than equivalent to the mail services\r\nperformed by it for the Government. The recommendations of the\r\nPostmaster-General in respect to letter postage, except on letters from and\r\nto California and Oregon, were substantially adopted by the last Congress.\r\nHe now recommends adherence to the present letter rates and advises against\r\na further reduction until justified by the revenue of the Department.\r\n\r\nHe also recommends that the rates of postage on printed matter be so\r\nrevised as to render them more simple and more uniform in their operation\r\nupon all classes of printed matter. I submit the recommendations of the\r\nreport to your favorable consideration.\r\n\r\nThe public statutes of the United States have now been accumulating for\r\nmore than sixty years, and, interspersed with private acts, are scattered\r\nthrough numerous volumes, and, from the cost of the whole, have become\r\nalmost inaccessible to the great mass of the community. They also exhibit\r\nmuch of the incongruity and imperfection of hasty legislation. As it seems\r\nto be generally conceded that there is no \"common law\" of the United States\r\nto supply the defects of their legislation, it is most important that that\r\nlegislation should be as perfect as possible, defining every power intended\r\nto be conferred, every crime intended to be made punishable, and\r\nprescribing the punishment to be inflicted. In addition to some particular\r\ncases spoken of more at length, the whole criminal code is now lamentably\r\ndefective. Some offenses are imperfectly described and others are entirely\r\nomitted, so that flagrant crimes may be committed with impunity. The scale\r\nof punishment is not in all cases graduated according to the degree and\r\nnature of the offense, and is often rendered more unequal by the different\r\nmodes of imprisonment or penitentiary confinement in the different States.\r\n\r\nMany laws of a permanent character have been introduced into appropriation\r\nbills, and it is often difficult to determine whether the particular clause\r\nexpires with the temporary act of which it is a part or continues in force.\r\nIt has also frequently happened that enactments and provisions of law have\r\nbeen introduced into bills with the title or general subject of which they\r\nhave little or no connection or relation. In this mode of legislation so\r\nmany enactments have been heaped upon each other, and often with but little\r\nconsideration, that in many instances it is difficult to search out and\r\ndetermine what is the law.\r\n\r\nThe Government of the United States is emphatically a government of written\r\nlaws. The statutes should therefore, as far as practicable, not only be\r\nmade accessible to all, but be expressed in language so plain and simple as\r\nto be understood by all and arranged in such method as to give perspicuity\r\nto every subject. Many of the States have revised their public acts with\r\ngreat and manifest benefit, and I recommend that provision be made by law\r\nfor the appointment of a commission to revise the public statutes of the\r\nUnited States, arranging them in order, supplying deficiencies, correcting\r\nincongruities, simplifying their language, and reporting them to Congress\r\nfor its action.\r\n\r\nAn act of Congress approved 30th September, 1850, contained a provision for\r\nthe extension of the Capitol according to such plan as might be approved by\r\nthe President, and appropriated $100,000 to be expended under his direction\r\nby such architect as he should appoint to execute the same. On examining\r\nthe various plans which had been submitted by different architects in\r\npursuance of an advertisement by a committee of the Senate no one was found\r\nto be entirely satisfactory, and it was therefore deemed advisable to\r\ncombine and adopt the advantages of several.\r\n\r\nThe great object to be accomplished was to make such an addition as would\r\nafford ample and convenient halls for the deliberations of the two Houses\r\nof Congress, with sufficient accommodations for spectators and suitable\r\napartments for the committees and officers of the two branches of the\r\nLegislature. It was also desirable not to mar the harmony and beauty of the\r\npresent structure, which, as a specimen of architecture, is so universally\r\nadmired. Keeping these objects in view, I concluded to make the addition by\r\nwings, detached from the present building, yet connected with it by\r\ncorridors. This mode of enlargement will leave the present Capitol\r\nuninjured and afford great advantages for ventilation and the admission of\r\nlight, and will enable the work to progress without interrupting the\r\ndeliberations of Congress. To carry this plan into effect I have appointed\r\nan experienced and competent architect. The corner stone was laid on the\r\n4th day of July last with suitable ceremonies, since which time the work\r\nhas advanced with commendable rapidity, and the foundations of both wings\r\nare now nearly complete.\r\n\r\nI again commend to your favorable regard the interests of the District of\r\nColumbia, and deem it only necessary to remind you that although its\r\ninhabitants have no voice in the choice of Representatives in Congress,\r\nthey are not the less entitled to a just and liberal consideration in your\r\nlegislation. My opinions on this subject were more fully expressed in my\r\nlast annual communication.\r\n\r\nOther subjects were brought to the attention of Congress in my last annual\r\nmessage, to which I would respectfully refer. But there was one of more\r\nthan ordinary interest, to which I again invite your special attention. I\r\nallude to the recommendation for the appointment of a commission to settle\r\nprivate claims against the United States. Justice to individuals, as well\r\nas to the Government, imperatively demands that some more convenient and\r\nexpeditious mode than an appeal to Congress should be adopted.\r\n\r\nIt is deeply to be regretted that in several instances officers of the\r\nGovernment, in attempting to execute the law for the return of fugitives\r\nfrom labor, have been openly resisted and their efforts frustrated and\r\ndefeated by lawless and violent mobs; that in one case such resistance\r\nresulted in the death of an estimable citizen, and in others serious injury\r\nensued to those officers and to individuals who were using their endeavors\r\nto sustain the laws. Prosecutions have been instituted against the alleged\r\noffenders so far as they could be identified, and are still pending. I have\r\nregarded it as my duty in these cases to give all aid legally in my power\r\nto the enforcement of the laws, and I shall continue to do so wherever and\r\nwhenever their execution may be resisted.\r\n\r\nThe act of Congress for the return of fugitives from labor is one required\r\nand demanded by the express words of the Constitution. The Constitution\r\ndeclares that--No person held to service or labor in one State, under the\r\nlaws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law or\r\nregulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor, but shall be\r\ndelivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be\r\ndue. This constitutional provision is equally obligatory upon the\r\nlegislative, the executive, and judicial departments of the Government, and\r\nupon every citizen of the United States.\r\n\r\nCongress, however, must from necessity first act upon the subject by\r\nprescribing the proceedings necessary to ascertain that the person is a\r\nfugitive and the means to be used for his restoration to the claimant. This\r\nwas done by an act passed during the first term of President Washington,\r\nwhich was amended by that enacted by the last Congress, and it now remains\r\nfor the executive and judicial departments to take care that these laws be\r\nfaithfully executed. This injunction of the Constitution is as peremptory\r\nand as binding as any other; it stands exactly on the same foundation as\r\nthat clause which provides for the return of fugitives from justice, or\r\nthat which declares that no bill of attainder or ex post facto law shall be\r\npassed, or that which provides for an equality of taxation according to the\r\ncensus, or the clause declaring that all duties shall be uniform throughout\r\nthe United States, or the important provision that the trial of all crimes\r\nshall be by jury. These several articles and clauses of the Constitution,\r\nall resting on the same authority, must stand or fall together. Some\r\nobjections have been urged against the details of the act for the return of\r\nfugitives from labor, but it is worthy of remark that the main opposition\r\nis aimed against the Constitution itself, and proceeds from persons and\r\nclasses of persons many of whom declare their wish to see that Constitution\r\noverturned. They avow their hostility to any law which shall give full and\r\npractical effect to this requirement of the Constitution. Fortunately, the\r\nnumber of these persons is comparatively small, and is believed to be daily\r\ndiminishing; but the issue which they present is one which involves the\r\nsupremacy and even the existence of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nCases have heretofore arisen in which individuals have denied the binding\r\nauthority of acts of Congress, and even States have proposed to nullify\r\nsuch acts upon the ground that the Constitution was the supreme law of the\r\nland, and that those acts of Congress were repugnant to that instrument;\r\nbut nullification is now aimed not so much against particular laws as being\r\ninconsistent with the Constitution as against the Constitution itself, and\r\nit is not to be disguised that a spirit exists, and has been actively at\r\nwork, to rend asunder this Union, which is our cherished inheritance from\r\nour Revolutionary fathers.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message I stated that I considered the series of measures\r\nwhich had been adopted at the previous session in reference to the\r\nagitation growing out of the Territorial and slavery questions as a final\r\nsettlement in principle and substance of the dangerous and exciting\r\nsubjects which they embraced, and I recommended adherence to the adjustment\r\nestablished by those measures until time and experience should demonstrate\r\nthe necessity of further legislation to guard against evasion or abuse. I\r\nwas not induced to make this recommendation because I thought those\r\nmeasures perfect, for no human legislation can be perfect. Wide differences\r\nand jarring opinions can only be reconciled by yielding something on all\r\nsides, and this result had been reached after an angry conflict of many\r\nmonths, in which one part of the country was arrayed against another, and\r\nviolent convulsion seemed to be imminent. Looking at the interests of the\r\nwhole country, I felt it to be my duty to seize upon this compromise as the\r\nbest that could be obtained amid conflicting interests and to insist upon\r\nit as a final settlement, to be adhered to by all who value the peace and\r\nwelfare of the country. A year has now elapsed since that recommendation\r\nwas made. To that recommendation I still adhere, and I congratulate you and\r\nthe country upon the general acquiescence in these measures of peace which\r\nhas been exhibited in all parts of the Republic. And not only is there this\r\ngeneral acquiescence in these measures, but the spirit of conciliation\r\nwhich has been manifested in regard to them in all parts of the country has\r\nremoved doubts and uncertainties in the minds of thousands of good men\r\nconcerning the durability of our popular institutions and given renewed\r\nassurance that our liberty and our Union may subsist together for the\r\nbenefit of this and all succeeding generations.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nMillard Fillmore\r\nDecember 6, 1852\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nThe brief space which has elapsed since the close of your last session has\r\nbeen marked by no extraordinary political event. The quadrennial election\r\nof Chief Magistrate has passed off with less than the usual excitement.\r\nHowever individuals and parties may have been disappointed in the result,\r\nit is, nevertheless, a subject of national congratulation that the choice\r\nhas been effected by the independent suffrages of a free people,\r\nundisturbed by those influences which in other countries have too often\r\naffected the purity of popular elections.\r\n\r\nOur grateful thanks are due to an all-merciful Providence, not only for\r\nstaying the pestilence which in different forms has desolated some of our\r\ncities, but for crowning the labors of the husbandman with an abundant\r\nharvest and the nation generally with the blessings of peace and\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\nWithin a few weeks the public mind has been deeply affected by the death of\r\nDaniel Webster, filling at his decease the office of Secretary of State.\r\nHis associates in the executive government have sincerely sympathized with\r\nhis family and the public generally on this mournful occasion. His\r\ncommanding talents, his great political and professional eminence, his\r\nwell-tried patriotism, and his long and faithful services in the most\r\nimportant public trusts have caused his death to be lamented throughout the\r\ncountry and have earned for him a lasting place in our history. In the\r\ncourse of the last summer considerable anxiety was caused for a short time\r\nby an official intimation from the Government of Great Britain that orders\r\nhad been given for the protection of the fisheries upon the coasts of the\r\nBritish provinces in North America against the alleged encroachments of the\r\nfishing vessels of the United States and France. The shortness of this\r\nnotice and the season of the year seemed to make it a matter of urgent\r\nimportance. It was at first apprehended that an increased naval force had\r\nbeen ordered to the fishing grounds to carry into effect the British\r\ninterpretation of those provisions in the convention of 1818 in reference\r\nto the true intent of which the two Governments differ. It was soon\r\ndiscovered that such was not the design of Great Britain, and satisfactory\r\nexplanations of the real objects of the measure have been given both here\r\nand in London.\r\n\r\nThe unadjusted difference, however, between the two Governments as to the\r\ninterpretation of the first article of the convention of 1818 is still a\r\nmatter of importance. American fishing vessels, within nine or ten years,\r\nhave been excluded from waters to which they had free access for\r\ntwenty-five years after the negotiation of the treaty. In 1845 this\r\nexclusion was relaxed so far as concerns the Bay of Fundy, but the just and\r\nliberal intention of the home Government, in compliance with what we think\r\nthe true construction of the convention, to open all the other outer bays\r\nto our fishermen was abandoned in consequence of the opposition of the\r\ncolonies. Notwithstanding this, the United States have, since the Bay of\r\nFundy was reopened to our fishermen in 1845, pursued the most liberal\r\ncourse toward the colonial fishing interests. By the revenue law of 1846\r\nthe duties on colonial fish entering our ports were very greatly reduced,\r\nand by the warehousing act it is allowed to be entered in bond without\r\npayment of duty. In this way colonial fish has acquired the monopoly of the\r\nexport trade in our market and is entering to some extent into the home\r\nconsumption. These facts were among those which increased the sensibility\r\nof our fishing interest at the movement in question. These circumstances\r\nand the incidents above alluded to have led me to think the moment\r\nfavorable for a reconsideration of the entire subject of the fisheries on\r\nthe coasts of the British Provinces, with a view to place them upon a more\r\nliberal footing of reciprocal privilege. A willingness to meet us in some\r\narrangement of this kind is understood to exist on the part of Great\r\nBritain, with a desire on her part to include in one comprehensive\r\nsettlement as well this subject as the commercial intercourse between the\r\nUnited States and the British Provinces. I have thought that, whatever\r\narrangements may be made on these two subjects, it is expedient that they\r\nshould be embraced in separate conventions. The illness and death of the\r\nlate Secretary of State prevented the commencement of the contemplated\r\nnegotiation. Pains have been taken to collect the information required for\r\nthe details of such an arrangement. The subject is attended with\r\nconsiderable difficulty. If it is found practicable to come to an agreement\r\nmutually acceptable to the two parties, conventions may be concluded in the\r\ncourse of the present winter. The control of Congress over all the\r\nprovisions of such an arrangement affecting the revenue will of course be\r\nreserved.\r\n\r\nThe affairs of Cuba formed a prominent topic in my last annual message.\r\nThey remain in an uneasy condition, and a feeling of alarm and irritation\r\non the part of the Cuban authorities appears to exist. This feeling has\r\ninterfered with the regular commercial intercourse between the United\r\nStates and the island and led to some acts of which we have a fight to\r\ncomplain. But the Captain-General of Cuba is clothed with no power to treat\r\nwith foreign governments, nor is he in any degree under the control of the\r\nSpanish minister at Washington. Any communication which he may hold with an\r\nagent of a foreign power is informal and matter of courtesy. Anxious to put\r\nan end to the existing inconveniences (which seemed to rest on a\r\nmisconception), I directed the newly appointed minister to Mexico to visit\r\nHavana on his way to Vera Cruz. He was respectfully received by the\r\nCaptain-General, who conferred with him freely on the recent occurrences,\r\nbut no permanent arrangement was effected.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the refusal of the Captain-Generalto allow passengers and\r\nthe mail to be landed in certain cases, for a reason which does not\r\nfurnish, in the opinion of this Government, even a good presumptive ground\r\nfor such prohibition, has been made the subject of a serious remonstrance\r\nat Madrid, and I have no reason to doubt that due respect will be paid by\r\nthe Government of Her Catholic Majesty to the representations which our\r\nminister has been instructed to make on the subject.\r\n\r\nIt is but justice to the Captain-General to add that his conduct toward the\r\nsteamers employed to carry the mails of the United States to Havana has,\r\nwith the exceptions above alluded to, been marked with kindness and\r\nliberality, and indicates no general purpose of interfering with the\r\ncommercial correspondence and intercourse between the island and this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nEarly in the present year official notes were received from the ministers\r\nof France and England inviting the Government of the United States to\r\nbecome a party with Great Britain and France to a tripartite convention, in\r\nvirtue of which the three powers should severally and collectively disclaim\r\nnow and for the future all intention to obtain possession of the island of\r\nCuba, and should bind themselves to discountenance all attempts to that\r\neffect on the part of any power or individual whatever. This invitation has\r\nbeen respectfully declined, for reasons which it would occupy too much\r\nspace in this communication to state in detail, but which led me to think\r\nthat the proposed measure would be of doubtful constitutionality,\r\nimpolitic, and unavailing. I have, however, in common with several of my\r\npredecessors, directed the ministers of France and England to be assured\r\nthat the United States entertain no designs against Cuba, but that, on the\r\ncontrary, I should regard its incorporation into the Union at the present\r\ntime as fraught with serious peril.\r\n\r\nWere this island comparatively destitute of inhabitants or occupied by a\r\nkindred race, I should regard it, if voluntarily ceded by Spain, as a most\r\ndesirable acquisition. But under existing circumstances I should look upon\r\nits incorporation into our Union as a very hazardous measure. It would\r\nbring into the Confederacy a population of a different national stock,\r\nspeaking a different language, and not likely to harmonize with the other\r\nmembers. It would probably affect in a prejudicial manner the industrial\r\ninterests of the South, and it might revive those conflicts of opinion\r\nbetween the different sections of the country which lately shook the Union\r\nto its center, and which have been so happily compromised.\r\n\r\nThe rejection by the Mexican Congress of the convention which had been\r\nconcluded between that Republic and the United States for the protection of\r\na transit way across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and of the interests of\r\nthose citizens of the United States who had become proprietors of the\r\nrights which Mexico had conferred on one of her own citizens in regard to\r\nthat transit has thrown a serious obstacle in the way of the attainment of\r\na very desirable national object. I am still willing to hope that the\r\ndifferences on the subject which exist, or may hereafter arise, between the\r\nGovernments will be amicably adjusted. This subject, however, has already\r\nengaged the attention of the Senate of the United States, and requires no\r\nfurther comment in this communication.\r\n\r\nThe settlement of the question respecting the port of San Juan de Nicaragua\r\nand of the controversy between the Republics of Costa Rica and Nicaragua in\r\nregard to their boundaries was considered indispensable to the commencement\r\nof the ship canal between the two oceans, which was the subject of the\r\nconvention between the United States and Great Britain of the 19th of\r\nApril, 1850. Accordingly, a proposition for the same purposes, addressed to\r\nthe two Governments in that quarter and to the Mosquito Indians, was agreed\r\nto in April last by the Secretary of State and the minister of Her\r\nBritannic Majesty. Besides the wish to aid in reconciling the differences\r\nof the two Republics, I engaged in the negotiation from a desire to place\r\nthe great work of a ship canal between the two oceans under one\r\njurisdiction and to establish the important port of San Juan de Nicaragua\r\nunder the government of a civilized power. The proposition in question was\r\nassented to by Costs Rica and the Mosquito Indians. It has not proved\r\nequally acceptable to Nicaragua, but it is to be hoped that the further\r\nnegotiations on the subject which are in train will be carried on in that\r\nspirit of conciliation and compromise which ought always to prevail on such\r\noccasions, and that they will lead to a satisfactory result.\r\n\r\nI have the satisfaction to inform you that the executive government of\r\nVenezuela has acknowledged some claims of citizens of the United States\r\nwhich have for many years past been urged by our charge d'affaires at\r\nCaracas. It is hoped that the same sense of justice will actuate the\r\nCongress of that Republic in providing the means for their payment.\r\n\r\nThe recent revolution in Buenos Ayres and the Confederated States having\r\nopened the prospect of an improved state of things in that quarter, the\r\nGovernments of Great Britain and France determined to negotiate with the\r\nchief of the new confederacy for the free access of their commerce to the\r\nextensive countries watered by the tributaries of the La Plata; and they\r\ngave a friendly notice of this purpose to the United States, that we might,\r\nif we thought proper, pursue the same course. In compliance with this\r\ninvitation, our minister at Rio Janeiro and our charge d'affaires at\r\nBuenos Ayres have been fully authorized to conclude treaties with the newly\r\norganized confederation or the States composing it. The delays which have\r\ntaken place in the formation of the new government have as yet prevented\r\nthe execution of those instructions, but there is every reason to hope that\r\nthese vast countries will be eventually opened to our commerce.\r\n\r\nA treaty of commerce has been concluded between the United States and the\r\nOriental Republic of Uruguay, which will be laid before the Senate. Should\r\nthis convention go into operation, it will open to the commercial\r\nenterprise of our citizens a country of great extent and unsurpassed in\r\nnatural resources, but from which foreign nations have hitherto been almost\r\nwholly excluded.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence of the late Secretary of State with the Peruvian charge\r\nd'affaires relative to the Lobos Islands was communicated to Congress\r\ntoward the close of the last session. Since that time, on further\r\ninvestigation of the subject, the doubts which had been entertained of the\r\ntitle of Peru to those islands have been removed, and I have deemed it just\r\nthat the temporary wrong which had been unintentionally done her from want\r\nof information should be repaired by an unreserved acknowledgment of her\r\nsovereignty.\r\n\r\nI have the satisfaction to inform you that the course pursued by Peru has\r\nbeen creditable to the liberality of her Government. Before it was known by\r\nher that her title would be acknowledged at Washington, her minister of\r\nforeign affairs had authorized our charge d'affaires at Lima to announce\r\nto the American vessels which had gone to the Lobos for guano that the\r\nPeruvian Government was willing to freight them on its own account. This\r\nintention has been carried into effect by the Peruvian minister here by an\r\narrangement which is believed to be advantageous to the parties in\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nOur settlements on the shores of the Pacific have already given a great\r\nextension, and in some respects a new direction, to our commerce in that\r\nocean. A direct and rapidly increasing intercourse has sprung up with\r\neastern Asia. The waters of the Northern Pacific, even into the Arctic Sea,\r\nhave of late years been frequented by our whalemen. The application of\r\nsteam to the general purposes of navigation is becoming daily more common,\r\nand makes it desirable to obtain fuel and other necessary supplies at\r\nconvenient points on the route between Asia and our Pacific shores. Our\r\nunfortunate countrymen who from time to time suffer shipwreck on the coasts\r\nof the eastern seas are entitled to protection. Besides these specific\r\nobjects, the general prosperity of our States on the Pacific requires that\r\nan attempt should be made to open the opposite regions of Asia to a\r\nmutually beneficial intercourse. It is obvious that this attempt could be\r\nmade by no power to so great advantage as by the United States, whose\r\nconstitutional system excludes every idea of distant colonial dependencies.\r\nI have accordingly been led to order an appropriate naval force to Japan,\r\nunder the command of a discreet and intelligent officer of the highest rank\r\nknown to our service. He is instructed to endeavor to obtain from the\r\nGovernment of that country some relaxation of the inhospitable and\r\nantisocial system which it has pursued for about two centuries. He has been\r\ndirected particularly to remonstrate in the strongest language against the\r\ncruel treatment to which our shipwrecked mariners have often been subjected\r\nand to insist that they shall be treated with humanity. He is instructed,\r\nhowever, at the same time, to give that Government the amplest assurances\r\nthat the objects of the United States are such, and such only, as I have\r\nindicated, and that the expedition is friendly and peaceful.\r\nNotwithstanding the jealousy with which the Governments of eastern Asia\r\nregard all overtures from foreigners, I am not without hopes of a\r\nbeneficial result of the expedition. Should it be crowned with success, the\r\nadvantages will not be confined to the United States, but, as in the case\r\nof China, will be equally enjoyed by all the other maritime powers. I have\r\nmuch satisfaction in stating that in all the steps preparatory to this\r\nexpedition the Government of the United States has been materially aided by\r\nthe good offices of the King of the Netherlands, the only European power\r\nhaving any commercial relations with Japan.\r\n\r\nIn passing from this survey of our foreign relations, I invite the\r\nattention of Congress to the condition of that Department of the Government\r\nto which this branch of the public business is intrusted. Our intercourse\r\nwith foreign powers has of late years greatly increased, both in\r\nconsequence of our own growth and the introduction of many new states into\r\nthe family of nations. In this way the Department of State has become\r\noverburdened. It has by the recent establishment of the Department of the\r\nInterior been relieved of some portion of the domestic business. If the\r\nresidue of the business of that kind--such as the distribution of\r\nCongressional documents, the keeping, publishing, and distribution of the\r\nlaws of the United States, the execution of the copyright law, the subject\r\nof reprieves and pardons, and some other subjects relating to interior\r\nadministration--should be transferred from the Department of State, it\r\nwould unquestionably be for the benefit of the public service. I would also\r\nsuggest that the building appropriated to the State Department is not\r\nfireproof; that there is reason to think there are defects in its\r\nconstruction, and that the archives of the Government in charge of the\r\nDepartment, with the precious collections of the manuscript papers of\r\nWashington, Jefferson, Hamilton, Madison, and Monroe, are exposed to\r\ndestruction by fire. A similar remark may be made of the buildings\r\nappropriated to the War and Navy Departments.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the Treasury is exhibited in the annual report from that\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\nThe cash receipts into the Treasury for the fiscal year ending the 30th\r\nJune last, exclusive of trust funds, were $49,728,386.89, and the\r\nexpenditures for the same period, likewise exclusive of trust funds, were\r\n$46,007,896.20, of which $9,455,815.83 was on account of the principal and\r\ninterest of the public debt, including the last installment of the\r\nindemnity to Mexico under the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, leaving a\r\nbalance of $14,632,136.37 in the Treasury on the 1st day of July last.\r\nSince this latter period further purchases of the principal of the public\r\ndebt have been made to the extent of $2,456,547.49, and the surplus in the\r\nTreasury will continue to be applied to that object whenever the stock can\r\nbe procured within the limits as to price authorized by law.\r\n\r\nThe value of foreign merchandise imported during the last fiscal year was\r\n$207,240,101, and the value of domestic productions exported was\r\n$149,861,911, besides $17,204,026 of foreign merchandise exported, making\r\nthe aggregate of the entire exports $167,065,937. Exclusive of the above,\r\nthere was exported $42,507,285 in specie, and imported from foreign ports\r\n$5,262,643.\r\n\r\nIn my first annual message to Congress I called your attention to what\r\nseemed to me some defects in the present tariff, and recommended such\r\nmodifications as in my judgment were best adapted to remedy its evils and\r\npromote the prosperity of the country. Nothing has since occurred to change\r\nmy views on this important question.\r\n\r\nWithout repeating the arguments contained in my former message in favor of\r\ndiscriminating protective duties, I deem it my duty to call your attention\r\nto one or two other considerations affecting this subject. The first is the\r\neffect of large importations of foreign goods upon our currency. Most of\r\nthe gold of California, as fast as it is coined, finds its way directly to\r\nEurope in payment for goods purchased. In the second place, as our\r\nmanufacturing establishments are broken down by competition with\r\nforeigners, the capital invested in them is lost, thousands of honest and\r\nindustrious citizens are thrown out of employment, and the farmer, to that\r\nextent, is deprived of a home market for the sale of his surplus produce.\r\nIn the third place, the destruction of our manufactures leaves the\r\nforeigner without competition in our market, and he consequently raises the\r\nprice of the article sent here for sale, as is now seen in the increased\r\ncost of iron imported from England. The prosperity and wealth of every\r\nnation must depend upon its productive industry. The farmer is stimulated\r\nto exertion by finding a ready market for his surplus products, and\r\nbenefited by being able to exchange them without loss of time or expense of\r\ntransportation for the manufactures which his comfort or convenience\r\nrequires. This is always done to the best advantage where a portion of the\r\ncommunity in which he lives is engaged in other pursuits. But most\r\nmanufactures require an amount of capital and a practical skill which can\r\nnot be commanded unless they be protected for a time from ruinous\r\ncompetition from abroad. Hence the necessity of laying those duties upon\r\nimported goods which the Constitution authorizes for revenue in such a\r\nmanner as to protect and encourage the labor of our own citizens. Duties,\r\nhowever, should not be fixed at a rate so high as to exclude the foreign\r\narticle, but should be so graduated as to enable the domestic manufacturer\r\nfairly to compete with the foreigner in our own markets, and by this\r\ncompetition to reduce the price of the manufactured article to the consumer\r\nto the lowest rate at which it can be produced. This policy would place the\r\nmechanic by the side of the farmer, create a mutual interchange of their\r\nrespective commodities, and thus stimulate the industry of the whole\r\ncountry and render us independent of foreign nations for the supplies\r\nrequired by the habits or necessities of the people.\r\n\r\nAnother question, wholly independent of protection, presents itself, and\r\nthat is, whether the duties levied should be upon the value of the article\r\nat the place of shipment, or, where it is practicable, a specific duty,\r\ngraduated according to quantity, as ascertained by weight or measure. All\r\nour duties are at present ad valorem. A certain percentage is levied on the\r\nprice of the goods at the port of shipment in a foreign country. Most\r\ncommercial nations have found it indispensable, for the purpose of\r\npreventing fraud and perjury, to make the duties specific whenever the\r\narticle is of such a uniform value in weight or measure as to justify such\r\na duty. Legislation should never encourage dishonesty or crime. It is\r\nimpossible that the revenue officers at the port where the goods are\r\nentered and the duties paid should know with certainty what they cost in\r\nthe foreign country. Yet the law requires that they should levy the duty\r\naccording to such cost. They are therefore compelled to resort to very\r\nunsatisfactory evidence to ascertain what that cost was. They take the\r\ninvoice of the importer, attested by his oath, as the best evidence of\r\nwhich the nature of the case admits. But everyone must see that the invoice\r\nmay be fabricated and the oath by which it is supported false, by reason of\r\nwhich the dishonest importer pays a part only of the duties which are paid\r\nby the honest one, and thus indirectly receives from the Treasury of the\r\nUnited States a reward for his fraud and perjury. The reports of the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury heretofore made on this subject show conclusively\r\nthat these frauds have been practiced to a great extent. The tendency is to\r\ndestroy that high moral character for which our merchants have long been\r\ndistinguished, to defraud the Government of its revenue, to break down the\r\nhonest importer by a dishonest competition, and, finally, to transfer the\r\nbusiness of importation to foreign and irresponsible agents, to the great\r\ndetriment of our own citizens. I therefore again most earnestly recommend\r\nthe adoption of specific duties wherever it is practicable, or a home\r\nvaluation, to prevent these frauds.\r\n\r\nI would also again call your attention to the fact that the present tariff\r\nin some cases imposes a higher duty upon the raw material imported than\r\nupon the article manufactured from it, the consequence of which is that the\r\nduty operates to the encouragement of the foreigner and the discouragement\r\nof our own citizens.\r\n\r\nFor full and detailed information in regard to the general condition of our\r\nIndian affairs, I respectfully refer you to the report of the Secretary of\r\nthe Interior and the accompanying documents.\r\n\r\nThe Senate not having thought proper to ratify the treaties which have been\r\nnegotiated with the tribes of Indians in California and Oregon, our\r\nrelations with them have been left in a very unsatisfactory condition.\r\n\r\nIn other parts of our territory particular districts of country have been\r\nset apart for the exclusive occupation of the Indians, and their right to\r\nthe lands within those limits has been acknowledged and respected. But in\r\nCalifornia and Oregon there has been no recognition by the Government of\r\nthe exclusive right of the Indians to any part of the country. They are\r\ntherefore mere tenants at sufferance, and liable to be driven from place to\r\nplace at the pleasure of the whites.\r\n\r\nThe treaties which have been rejected proposed to remedy this evil by\r\nallotting to the different tribes districts of country suitable to their\r\nhabits of life and sufficient for their support. This provision, more than\r\nany other, it is believed, led to their rejection; and as no substitute for\r\nit has been adopted by Congress, it has not been deemed advisable to\r\nattempt to enter into new treaties of a permanent character, although no\r\neffort has been spared by temporary arrangements to preserve friendly\r\nrelations with them.\r\n\r\nIf it be the desire of Congress to remove them from the country altogether,\r\nor to assign to them particular districts more remote from the settlements\r\nof the whites, it will be proper to set apart by law the territory which\r\nthey are to occupy and to provide the means necessary for removing them to\r\nit. Justice alike to our own citizens and to the Indians requires the\r\nprompt action of Congress on this subject. The amendments proposed by the\r\nSenate to the treaties which were negotiated with the Sioux Indians of\r\nMinnesota have been submitted to the tribes who were parties to them, and\r\nhave received their assent. A large tract of valuable territory has thus\r\nbeen opened for settlement and cultivation, and all danger of collision\r\nwith these powerful and warlike bands has been happily removed.\r\n\r\nThe removal of the remnant of the tribe of Seminole Indians from Florida\r\nhas long been a cherished object of the Government, and it is one to which\r\nmy attention has been steadily directed. Admonished by past experience of\r\nthe difficulty and cost of the attempt to remove them by military force,\r\nresort has been had to conciliatory measures. By the invitation of the\r\nCommissioner of Indian Affairs, several of the principal chiefs recently\r\nvisited Washington, and whilst here acknowledged in writing the obligation\r\nof their tribe to remove with the least possible delay. Late advices from\r\nthe special agent of the Government represent that they adhere to their\r\npromise, and that a council of their people has been called to make their\r\npreliminary arrangements. A general emigration may therefore be confidently\r\nexpected at an early day.\r\n\r\nThe report from the General Land Office shows increased activity in its\r\noperations. The survey of the northern boundary of Iowa has been completed\r\nwith unexampled dispatch. Within the last year 9,522,953 acres of public\r\nland have been surveyed and 8,032,463 acres brought into market.\r\n\r\nAcres In the last fiscal year there were sold 1,553,071 Located with\r\nbounty-land warrants 3,201,314 Located with other certificates 115,682\r\nMaking a total of 4,870,067\r\n\r\nIn addition there were--Reported under swamp-land grants 5,219,188 For\r\ninternal improvements, railroads, etc 3,025,920 Making an aggregate of\r\n13,115,175 Being an increase of the amount sold and located under land\r\nwarrants of 569,220 acres over the previous year. The whole amount thus\r\nsold, located under land warrants, reported under swamp-land grants, and\r\nselected for internal improvements exceeds that of the previous year by\r\n3,342,372 acres; and the sales would without doubt have been much larger\r\nbut for the extensive reservations for railroads in Missouri, Mississippi,\r\nand Alabama.\r\n\r\nAcres For the quarter ending 30th September, 1852, there were sold 243,255\r\nLocated with bounty-land warrants 1,387,116 Located with other certificates\r\n15,649 Reported under swamp-land grants 2,485,233 Making an aggregate for\r\nthe quarter of 4,131,253\r\n\r\nMuch the larger portion of the labor of arranging and classifying the\r\nreturns of the last census has been finished, and it will now devolve upon\r\nCongress to make the necessary provision for the publication of the results\r\nin such form as shall be deemed best. The apportionment of representation\r\non the basis of the new census has been made by the Secretary of the\r\nInterior in conformity with the provisions of law relating to that subject,\r\nand the recent elections have been made in accordance with it.\r\n\r\nI commend to your favorable regard the suggestion contained in the report\r\nof the Secretary of the Interior that provision be made by law for the\r\npublication and distribution, periodically, of an analytical digest of all\r\nthe patents which have been or may hereafter be granted for useful\r\ninventions and discoveries, with such descriptions and illustrations as may\r\nbe necessary to present an intelligible view of their nature and operation.\r\nThe cost of such publication could easily be defrayed out of the patent\r\nfund, and I am persuaded that it could be applied to no object more\r\nacceptable to inventors and beneficial to the public at large.\r\n\r\nAn appropriation of $100,000 having been made at the last session for the\r\npurchase of a suitable site and for the erection, furnishing, and fitting\r\nup of an asylum for the insane of the District of Columbia and of the Army\r\nand Navy of the United States, the proper measures have been adopted to\r\ncarry this beneficent purpose into effect.\r\n\r\nBy the latest advices from the Mexican boundary commission it appears that\r\nthe survey of the river Gila from its continence with the Colorado to its\r\nsupposed intersection with the western line of New Mexico has been\r\ncompleted. The survey of the Rio Grande has also been finished from the\r\npoint agreed on by the commissioners as \"the point where it strikes the\r\nsouthern boundary of New Mexico\" to a point 135 miles below Eagle Pass,\r\nwhich is about two-thirds of the distance along the course of the river to\r\nits mouth.\r\n\r\nThe appropriation which was made at the last session of Congress for the\r\ncontinuation of the survey is subject to the following proviso: Provided,\r\nThat no part of this appropriation shall be used or expended until it shall\r\nbe made satisfactorily to appear to the President of the United States that\r\nthe southern boundary of New Mexico is not established by the commissioner\r\nand surveyor of the United States farther north of the town called \"Paso\"\r\nthan the same is laid down in Disturnell's map, which is added to the\r\ntreaty.\r\n\r\nMy attention was drawn to this subject by a report from the Department of\r\nthe Interior, which reviewed all the facts of the case and submitted for my\r\ndecision the question whether under existing circumstances any part of the\r\nappropriation could be lawfully used or expended for the further\r\nprosecution of the work. After a careful consideration of the subject I\r\ncame to the conclusion that it could not, and so informed the head of that\r\nDepartment. Orders were immediately issued by him to the commissioner and\r\nsurveyor to make no further requisitions on the Department, as they could\r\nnot be paid, and to discontinue all operations on the southern line of New\r\nMexico. But as the Department had no exact information as to the amount of\r\nprovisions and money which remained unexpended in the hands of the\r\ncommissioner and surveyor, it was left discretionary with them to continue\r\nthe survey down the Rio Grande as far as the means at their disposal would\r\nenable them or at once to disband the commission. A special messenger has\r\nsince arrived from the officer in charge of the survey on the river with\r\ninformation that the funds subject to his control were exhausted and that\r\nthe officers and others employed in the service were destitute alike of the\r\nmeans of prosecuting the work and of returning to their homes.\r\n\r\nThe object of the proviso was doubtless to arrest the survey of the\r\nsouthern and western lines of New Mexico, in regard to which different\r\nopinions have been expressed; for it is hardly to be supposed that there\r\ncould be any objection to that part of the line which extends along the\r\nchannel of the Rio Grande. But the terms of the law are so broad as to\r\nforbid the use of any part of the money for the prosecution of the work, or\r\neven for the payment to the officers and agents of the arrearages of pay\r\nwhich are justly due to them.\r\n\r\nI earnestly invite your prompt attention to this subject, and recommend a\r\nmodification of the terms of the proviso, so as to enable the Department to\r\nuse as much of the appropriation as will be necessary to discharge the\r\nexisting obligations of the Government and to complete the survey of the\r\nRio Grande to its mouth.\r\n\r\nIt will also be proper to make further provision by law for the fulfillment\r\nof our treaty with Mexico for running and marking the residue of the\r\nboundary line between the two countries.\r\n\r\nPermit me to invite your particular attention to the interests of the\r\nDistrict of Columbia, which are confided by the Constitution to your\r\npeculiar care.\r\n\r\nAmong the measures which seem to me of the greatest importance to its\r\nprosperity are the introduction of a copious supply of water into the city\r\nof Washington and the construction of suitable bridges across the Potomac\r\nto replace those which were destroyed by high water in the early part of\r\nthe present year.\r\n\r\nAt the last session of Congress an appropriation was made to defray the\r\ncost of the surveys necessary for determining the best means of affording\r\nan unfailing supply of good and wholesome water. Some progress has been\r\nmade in the survey, and as soon as it is completed the result will be laid\r\nbefore you.\r\n\r\nFurther appropriations will also be necessary for grading and paving the\r\nstreets and avenues and inclosing and embellishing the public grounds\r\nwithin the city of Washington.\r\n\r\nI commend all these objects, together with the charitable institutions of\r\nthe District, to your favorable regard. Every effort has been made to\r\nprotect our frontier and that of the adjoining Mexican States from the\r\nincursions of the Indian tribes. Of about 11,000 men of which the Army is\r\ncomposed, nearly 8,000 are employed in the defense of the newly acquired\r\nterritory (including Texas) and of emigrants proceeding thereto. I am\r\ngratified to say that these efforts have been unusually successful. With\r\nthe exception of some partial outbreaks in California and Oregon and\r\noccasional depredations on a portion of the Rio Grande, owing, it is\r\nbelieved, to the disturbed state of that border region, the inroads of the\r\nIndians have been effectually restrained.\r\n\r\nExperience has shown, however, that whenever the two races are brought into\r\ncontact collisions will inevitably occur. To prevent these collisions the\r\nUnited States have generally set apart portions of their territory for the\r\nexclusive occupation of the Indian tribes. A difficulty occurs, however, in\r\nthe application of this policy to Texas. By the terms of the compact by\r\nwhich that State was admitted into the Union she retained the ownership of\r\nall the vacant lands within her limits. The government of that State, it is\r\nunderstood, has assigned no portion of her territory to the Indians, but as\r\nfast as her settlements advance lays it off into counties and proceeds to\r\nsurvey and sell it. This policy manifestly tends not only to alarm and\r\nirritate the Indians, but to compel them to resort to plunder for\r\nsubsistence. It also deprives this Government of that influence and control\r\nover them without which no durable peace can ever exist between them and\r\nthe whites. I trust, therefore, that a due regard for her own interests,\r\napart from considerations of humanity and justice, will induce that State\r\nto assign a small portion of her vast domain for the provisional occupancy\r\nof the small remnants of tribes within her borders, subject, of course, to\r\nher ownership and eventual jurisdiction. If she should fail to do this, the\r\nfulfillment of our treaty stipulations with Mexico and our duty to the\r\nIndians themselves will, it is feared, become a subject of serious\r\nembarrassment to the Government. It is hoped, however, that a timely and\r\njust provision by Texas may avert this evil.\r\n\r\nNo appropriations for fortifications were made at the two last sessions of\r\nCongress. The cause of this omission is probably to be found in a growing\r\nbelief that the system of fortifications adopted in 1816, and heretofore\r\nacted on, requires revision.\r\n\r\nThe subject certainly deserves full and careful investigation, but it\r\nshould not be delayed longer than can be avoided. In the meantime there are\r\ncertain works which have been commenced, some of them nearly completed,\r\ndesigned to protect our principal seaports from Boston to New Orleans and a\r\nfew other important points. In regard to the necessity for these works, it\r\nis believed that little difference of opinion exists among military men. I\r\ntherefore recommend that the appropriations necessary to prosecute them be\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nI invite your attention to the remarks on this subject and on others\r\nconnected with his Department contained in the accompanying report of the\r\nSecretary of War.\r\n\r\nMeasures have been taken to carry into effect the law of the last session\r\nmaking provision for the improvement of certain rivers and harbors, and it\r\nis believed that the arrangements made for that purpose will combine\r\nefficiency with economy. Owing chiefly to the advanced season when the act\r\nwas passed, little has yet been done in regard to many of the works beyond\r\nmaking the necessary preparations. With respect to a few of the\r\nimprovements, the sums already appropriated will suffice to complete them;\r\nbut most of them will require additional appropriations. I trust that these\r\nappropriations will be made, and that this wise and beneficent policy, so\r\nauspiciously resumed, will be continued. Great care should be taken,\r\nhowever, to commence no work which is not of sufficient importance to the\r\ncommerce of the country to be viewed as national in its character. But\r\nworks which have been commenced should not be discontinued until completed,\r\nas otherwise the sums expended will in most cases be lost.\r\n\r\nThe report from the Navy Department will inform you of the prosperous\r\ncondition of the branch of the public service committed to its charge. It\r\npresents to your consideration many topics and suggestions of which I ask\r\nyour approval. It exhibits an unusual degree of activity in the operations\r\nof the Department during the past year. The preparations for the Japan\r\nexpedition, to which I have already alluded; the arrangements made for the\r\nexploration and survey of the China Seas, the Northern Pacific, and\r\nBehrings Straits; the incipient measures taken toward a reconnoissance of\r\nthe continent of Africa eastward of Liberia; the preparation for an early\r\nexamination of the tributaries of the river La Plata, which a recent decree\r\nof the provisional chief of the Argentine Confederation has opened to\r\nnavigation--all these enterprises and the means by which they are proposed\r\nto be accomplished have commanded my full approbation, and I have no doubt\r\nwill be productive of most useful results.\r\n\r\nTwo officers of the Navy were heretofore instructed to explore the whole\r\nextent of the Amazon River from the confines of Peru to its mouth. The\r\nreturn of one of them has placed in the possession of the Government an\r\ninteresting and valuable account of the character and resources of a\r\ncountry abounding in the materials of commerce, and which if opened to the\r\nindustry of the world will prove an inexhaustible fund of wealth. The\r\nreport of this exploration will be communicated to you as soon as it is\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\nAmong other subjects offered to your notice by the Secretary of the Navy, I\r\nselect for special commendation, in view of its connection with the\r\ninterests of the Navy, the plan submitted by him for the establishment of a\r\npermanent corps of seamen and the suggestions he has presented for the\r\nreorganization of the Naval Academy.\r\n\r\nIn reference to the first of these, I take occasion to say that I think it\r\nwill greatly improve the efficiency of the service, and that I regard it as\r\nstill more entitled to favor for the salutary influence it must exert upon\r\nthe naval discipline, now greatly disturbed by the increasing spirit of\r\ninsubordination resulting from our present system. The plan proposed for\r\nthe organization of the seamen furnishes a judicious substitute for the law\r\nof September, 1850, abolishing corporal punishment, and satisfactorily\r\nsustains the policy of that act under conditions well adapted to maintain\r\nthe authority of command and the order and security of our ships. It is\r\nbelieved that any change which proposes permanently to dispense with this\r\nmode of punishment should be preceded by a system of enlistment which shall\r\nsupply the Navy with seamen of the most meritorious class, whose good\r\ndeportment and pride of character may preclude all occasion for a resort to\r\npenalties of a harsh or degrading nature. The safety of a ship and her crew\r\nis often dependent upon immediate obedience to a command, and the authority\r\nto enforce it must be equally ready. The arrest of a refractory seaman in\r\nsuch moments not only deprives the ship of indispensable aid, but imposes a\r\nnecessity for double service on others, whose fidelity to their duties may\r\nbe relied upon in such an emergency. The exposure to this increased and\r\narduous labor since the passage of the act of 1850 has already had, to a\r\nmost observable and injurious extent, the effect of preventing the\r\nenlistment of the best seamen in the Navy. The plan now suggested is\r\ndesigned to promote a condition of service in which this objection will no\r\nlonger exist. The details of this plan may be established in great part, if\r\nnot altogether, by the Executive under the authority of existing laws, but\r\nI have thought it proper, in accordance with the suggestion of the\r\nSecretary of the Navy, to submit it to your approval.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of a corps of apprentices for the Navy, or boys to be\r\nenlisted until they become of age, and to be employed under such\r\nregulations as the Navy Department may devise, as proposed in the report, I\r\ncordially approve and commend to your consideration; and I also concur in\r\nthe suggestion that this system for the early training of seamen may be\r\nmost usefully ingrafted upon the service of our merchant marine. The other\r\nproposition of the report to which I have referred--the reorganization of\r\nthe Naval Academy--I recommend to your attention as a project worthy of\r\nyour encouragement and support. The valuable services already rendered by\r\nthis institution entitle it to the continuance of your fostering care.\r\n\r\nYour attention is respectfully called to the report of the Postmaster\r\nGeneral for the detailed operation of his Department during the last fiscal\r\nyear, from which it will be seen that the receipts from postages for that\r\ntime were less by $1,431,696 than for the preceding fiscal year, being a\r\ndecrease of about 23 per cent.\r\n\r\nThis diminution is attributable to the reduction in the rates of postage\r\nmade by the act of March 3, 1851, which reduction took effect at the\r\ncommencement of the last fiscal year.\r\n\r\nAlthough in its operation during the last year the act referred to has not\r\nfulfilled the predictions of its friends by increasing the correspondence\r\nof the country in proportion to the reduction of postage, I should,\r\nnevertheless, question the policy of returning to higher rates. Experience\r\nwarrants the expectation that as the community becomes accustomed to cheap\r\npostage correspondence will increase. It is believed that from this cause\r\nand from the rapid growth of the country in population and business the\r\nreceipts of the Department must ultimately exceed its expenses, and that\r\nthe country may safely rely upon the continuance of the present cheap rate\r\nof postage.\r\n\r\nIn former messages I have, among other things, respectfully recommended to\r\nthe consideration of Congress the propriety and necessity of further\r\nlegislation for the protection and punishment of foreign consuls residing\r\nin the United States; to revive, with certain modifications, the act of\r\n10th March, 1838, to restrain unlawful military expeditions against the\r\ninhabitants of conterminous states or territories; for the preservation and\r\nprotection from mutilation or theft of the papers, records, and archives of\r\nthe nation; for authorizing the surplus revenue to be applied to the\r\npayment of the public debt in advance of the time when it will become due;\r\nfor the establishment of land offices for the sale of the public lands in\r\nCalifornia and the Territory of Oregon; for the construction of a road from\r\nthe Mississippi Valley to the Pacific Ocean; for the establishment of a\r\nbureau of agriculture for the promotion of that interest, perhaps the most\r\nimportant in the country; for the prevention of frauds upon the Government\r\nin applications for pensions and bounty lands; for the establishment of a\r\nuniform fee bill, prescribing a specific compensation for every service\r\nrequired of clerks, district attorneys, and marshals; for authorizing an\r\nadditional regiment of mounted men for the defense of our frontiers against\r\nthe Indians and for fulfilling our treaty stipulations with Mexico to\r\ndefend her citizens against the Indians \"with equal diligence and energy as\r\nour own;\" for determining the relative rank between the naval and civil\r\nofficers in our public ships and between the officers of the Army and Navy\r\nin the various grades of each; for reorganizing the naval establishment by\r\nfixing the number of officers in each grade, and providing for a retired\r\nlist upon reduced pay of those unfit for active duty; for prescribing and\r\nregulating punishments in the Navy; for the appointment of a commission to\r\nrevise the public statutes of the United States by arranging them in order,\r\nsupplying deficiencies, correcting incongruities, simplifying their\r\nlanguage, and reporting them to Congress for its final action; and for the\r\nestablishment of a commission to adjudicate and settle private claims\r\nagainst the United States. I am not aware, however, that any of these\r\nsubjects have been finally acted upon by Congress. Without repeating the\r\nreasons for legislation on these subjects which have been assigned in\r\nformer messages, I respectfully recommend them again to your favorable\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nI think it due to the several Executive Departments of this Government to\r\nbear testimony to the efficiency and integrity with which they are\r\nconducted. With all the careful superintendence which it is possible for\r\nthe heads of those Departments to exercise, still the due administration\r\nand guardianship of the public money must very much depend on the\r\nvigilance, intelligence, and fidelity of the subordinate officers and\r\nclerks, and especially on those intrusted with the settlement and\r\nadjustment of claims and accounts. I am gratified to believe that they have\r\ngenerally performed their duties faithfully and well. They are appointed to\r\nguard the approaches to the public Treasury, and they occupy positions that\r\nexpose them to all the temptations and seductions which the cupidity of\r\npeculators and fraudulent claimants can prompt them to employ. It will be\r\nbut a wise precaution to protect the Government against that source of\r\nmischief and corruption, as far as it can be done, by the enactment of all\r\nproper legal penalties. The laws in this respect are supposed to be\r\ndefective, and I therefore deem it my duty to call your attention to the\r\nsubject and to recommend that provision be made by law for the punishment\r\nnot only of those who shall accept bribes, but also of those who shall\r\neither promise, give, or offer to give to any of those officers or clerks a\r\nbribe or reward touching or relating to any matter of their official action\r\nor duty.\r\n\r\nIt has been the uniform policy of this Government, from its foundation to\r\nthe present day, to abstain from all interference in the domestic affairs\r\nof other nations. The consequence has been that while the nations of Europe\r\nhave been engaged in desolating wars our country has pursued its peaceful\r\ncourse to unexampled prosperity and happiness. The wars in which we have\r\nbeen compelled to engage in defense of the rights and honor of the country\r\nhave been, fortunately, of short duration. During the terrific contest of\r\nnation against nation which succeeded the French Revolution we were enabled\r\nby the wisdom and firmness of President Washington to maintain our\r\nneutrality. While other nations were drawn into this wide-sweeping\r\nwhirlpool, we sat quiet and unmoved upon our own shores. While the flower\r\nof their numerous armies was wasted by disease or perished by hundreds of\r\nthousands upon the battlefield, the youth of this favored land were\r\npermitted to enjoy the blessings of peace beneath the paternal roof. While\r\nthe States of Europe incurred enormous debts, under the burden of which\r\ntheir subjects still groan, and which must absorb no small part of the\r\nproduct of the honest industry of those countries for generations to come,\r\nthe United States have once been enabled to exhibit the proud spectacle of\r\na nation free from public debt, and if permitted to pursue our prosperous\r\nway for a few years longer in peace we may do the same again.\r\n\r\nBut it is now said by some that this policy must be changed. Europe is no\r\nlonger separated from us by a voyage of months, but steam navigation has\r\nbrought her within a few days' sail of our shores. We see more of her\r\nmovements and take a deeper interest in her controversies. Although no one\r\nproposes that we should join the fraternity of potentates who have for ages\r\nlavished the blood and treasure of their subjects in maintaining \"the\r\nbalance of power,\" yet it is said that we ought to interfere between\r\ncontending sovereigns and their subjects for the purpose of overthrowing\r\nthe monarchies of Europe and establishing in their place republican\r\ninstitutions. It is alleged that we have heretofore pursued a different\r\ncourse from a sense of our weakness, but that now our conscious strength\r\ndictates a change of policy, and that it is consequently our duty to mingle\r\nin these contests and aid those who are struggling for liberty.\r\n\r\nThis is a most seductive but dangerous appeal to the generous sympathies of\r\nfreemen. Enjoying, as we do, the blessings of a free Government, there is\r\nno man who has an American heart that would not rejoice to see these\r\nblessings extended to all other nations. We can not witness the struggle\r\nbetween the oppressed and his oppressor anywhere without the deepest\r\nsympathy for the former and the most anxious desire for his triumph.\r\nNevertheless, is it prudent or is it wise to involve ourselves in these\r\nforeign wars? Is it indeed true that we have heretofore refrained from\r\ndoing so merely from the degrading motive of a conscious weakness? For the\r\nhonor of the patriots who have gone before us, I can not admit it. Men of\r\nthe Revolution, who drew the sword against the oppressions of the mother\r\ncountry and pledged to Heaven \"their lives, their fortunes, and their\r\nsacred honor\" to maintain their freedom, could never have been actuated by\r\nso unworthy a motive. They knew no weakness or fear where right or duty\r\npointed the way, and it is a libel upon their fair fame for us, while we\r\nenjoy the blessings for which they so nobly fought and bled, to insinuate\r\nit. The truth is that the course which they pursued was dictated by a stern\r\nsense of international justice, by a statesmanlike prudence and a\r\nfar-seeing wisdom, looking not merely to the present necessities but to the\r\npermanent safety and interest of the country. They knew that the world is\r\ngoverned less by sympathy than by reason and force; that it was not\r\npossible for this nation to become a \"propagandist\" of free principles\r\nwithout arraying against it the combined powers of Europe, and that the\r\nresult was more likely to be the overthrow of republican liberty here than\r\nits establishment there. History has been written in vain for those who can\r\ndoubt this. France had no sooner established a republican form of\r\ngovernment than she manifested a desire to force its blessings on all the\r\nworld. Her own historian informs us that, hearing of some petty acts of\r\ntyranny in a neighboring principality, \"the National Convention declared\r\nthat she would afford succor and fraternity to all nations who wished to\r\nrecover their liberty, and she gave it in charge to the executive power to\r\ngive orders to the generals of the French armies to aid all citizens who\r\nmight have been or should be oppressed in the cause of liberty.\" Here was\r\nthe false step which led to her subsequent misfortunes. She soon found\r\nherself involved in war with all the rest of Europe. In less than ten years\r\nher Government was changed from a republic to an empire, and finally, after\r\nshedding rivers of blood, foreign powers restored her exiled dynasty and\r\nexhausted Europe sought peace and repose in the unquestioned ascendency of\r\nmonarchical principles. Let us learn wisdom from her example. Let us\r\nremember that revolutions do not always establish freedom. Our own free\r\ninstitutions were not the offspring of our Revolution. They existed before.\r\nThey were planted in the free charters of self-government under which the\r\nEnglish colonies grew up, and our Revolution only freed us from the\r\ndominion of a foreign power whose government was at variance with those\r\ninstitutions. But European nations have had no such training for\r\nself-government, and every effort to establish it by bloody revolutions has\r\nbeen, and must without that preparation continue to be, a failure. Liberty\r\nunregulated by law degenerates into anarchy, which soon becomes the most\r\nhorrid of all despotisms. Our policy is wisely to govern ourselves, and\r\nthereby to set such an example of national justice, prosperity, and true\r\nglory as shall teach to all nations the blessings of self-government and\r\nthe unparalleled enterprise and success of a free people.\r\n\r\nWe live in an age of progress, and ours is emphatically a country of\r\nprogress. Within the last half century the number of States in this Union\r\nhas nearly doubled, the population has almost quadrupled, and our\r\nboundaries have been extended from the Mississippi to the Pacific. Our\r\nterritory is checkered over with railroads and furrowed with canals. The\r\ninventive talent of our country is excited to the highest pitch, and the\r\nnumerous applications for patents for valuable improvements distinguish\r\nthis age and this people from all others. The genius of one American has\r\nenabled our commerce to move against wind and tide and that of another has\r\nannihilated distance in the transmission of intelligence. The whole country\r\nis full of enterprise. Our common schools are diffusing intelligence among\r\nthe people and our industry is fast accumulating the comforts and luxuries\r\nof life. This is in part owing to our peculiar position, to our fertile\r\nsoil and comparatively sparse population; but much of it is also owing to\r\nthe popular institutions under which we live, to the freedom which every\r\nman feels to engage in any useful pursuit according to his taste or\r\ninclination, and to the entire confidence that his person and property will\r\nbe protected by the laws. But whatever may be the cause of this\r\nunparalleled growth in population, intelligence, and wealth, one tiring is\r\nclear--that the Government must keep pace with the progress of the people.\r\nIt must participate in their spirit of enterprise, and while it exacts\r\nobedience to the laws and restrains all unauthorized invasions of the\r\nrights of neighboring states, it should foster and protect home industry\r\nand lend its powerful strength to the improvement of such means of\r\nintercommunication as are necessary to promote our internal commerce and\r\nstrengthen the ties which bind us together as a people.\r\n\r\nIt is not strange, however much it may be regretted, that such an\r\nexuberance of enterprise should cause some individuals to mistake change\r\nfor progress and the invasion of the rights of others for national prowess\r\nand glory. The former are constantly agitating for some change in the\r\norganic law, or urging new and untried theories of human rights. The latter\r\nare ever ready to engage in any wild crusade against a neighboring people,\r\nregardless of the justice of the enterprise and without looking at the\r\nfatal consequences to ourselves and to the cause of popular government.\r\nSuch expeditions, however, are often stimulated by mercenary individuals,\r\nwho expect to share the plunder or profit of the enterprise without\r\nexposing themselves to danger, and are led on by some irresponsible\r\nforeigner, who abuses the hospitality of our own Government by seducing the\r\nyoung and ignorant to join in his scheme of personal ambition or revenge\r\nunder the false and delusive pretense of extending the area of freedom.\r\nThese reprehensible aggressions but retard the true progress of our nation\r\nand tarnish its fair fame. They should therefore receive the indignant\r\nfrowns of every good citizen who sincerely loves his country and takes a\r\npride in its prosperity and honor. Our Constitution, though not perfect, is\r\ndoubtless the best that ever was formed. Therefore let every proposition to\r\nchange it be well weighed and, if found beneficial, cautiously adopted.\r\nEvery patriot will rejoice to see its authority so exerted as to advance\r\nthe prosperity and honor of the nation, whilst he will watch with jealousy\r\nany attempt to mutilate this charter of our liberties or pervert its powers\r\nto acts of aggression or injustice. Thus shall conservatism and progress\r\nblend their harmonious action in preserving the form and spirit of the\r\nConstitution and at the same time carry forward the great improvements of\r\nthe country with a rapidity and energy which freemen only can display.\r\n\r\nIn closing this my last annual communication, permit me, fellow-citizens,\r\nto congratulate you on the prosperous condition of our beloved country.\r\nAbroad its relations with all foreign powers are friendly, its rights are\r\nrespected, and its high place in the family of nations cheerfully\r\nrecognized. At home we enjoy an amount of happiness, public and private,\r\nwhich has probably never fallen to the lot of any other people. Besides\r\naffording to our own citizens a degree of prosperity of which on so large a\r\nscale I know of no other instance, our country is annually affording a\r\nrefuge and a home to multitudes, altogether without example, from the Old\r\nWorld.\r\n\r\nWe owe these blessings, under Heaven, to the happy Constitution and\r\nGovernment which were bequeathed to us by our fathers, and which it is our\r\nsacred duty to transmit in all their integrity to our children. We must all\r\nconsider it a great distinction and privilege to have been chosen by the\r\npeople to bear a part in the administration of such a Government. Called by\r\nan unexpected dispensation to its highest trust at a season of\r\nembarrassment and alarm, I entered upon its arduous duties with extreme\r\ndiffidence. I claim only to have discharged them to the best of an humble\r\nability, with a single eye to the public good, and it is with devout\r\ngratitude in retiring from office that I leave the country in a state of\r\npeace and prosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's State of the Union Addresses, by Millard Fillmore",
