This phase of our political problems has not received\r\nadequate recognition at the hands of writers on American politics. Very\r\noften indeed it has been entirely ignored, although in the short period\r\nwhich has elapsed since our Constitution was framed and adopted, the\r\nWestern world has passed through a political as well as an industrial\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\nIn the eighteenth century the majority was outside of the pale of\r\npolitical rights. Government as a matter of course was the expression of\r\nthe will of a minority. Even in the United States, where hereditary rule\r\nwas overthrown by the Revolution, an effective and recognized minority\r\ncontrol still survived through the property qualifications for the\r\nsuffrage and for office-holding, which excluded a large proportion of\r\nthe people from participation in political affairs. Under such\r\nconditions there could be but little of what is now known as democracy.\r\nMoreover, slavery continued to exist upon a large scale for nearly\r\nthree-quarters of a century after the Constitution was adopted, and was\r\nfinally abolished only within the memory of many now living.\r\n\r\nIt could hardly be expected that a political system set up for a\r\ncommunity containing a large slave population and in which the suffrage\r\nwas restricted, even among the free whites, should in any large measure\r\nembody the aims and ideas of present day democracy. In fact the American\r\nConstitution did not recognize the now more or less generally accepted\r\nprinciple of majority rule even as applying to the qualified voters.\r\nMoreover, it was not until several decades after the Constitution was\r\nadopted that the removal of property qualifications for voting allowed\r\nthe people generally to have a voice in political affairs.\r\n\r\nThe extension of the suffrage was a concession to the growing belief in\r\ndemocracy, but it failed to give the masses an effective control over\r\nthe general government, owing to the checks in the Constitution on\r\nmajority rule. It had one important consequence, however, which should\r\nnot be overlooked. Possession of the suffrage by the people generally\r\nled the undiscriminating to think that it made the opinion of the\r\nmajority a controlling factor in national politics.\r\n\r\nOur political writers have for the most part passed lightly over the\r\nundemocratic features of the Constitution and left the uncritical reader\r\nwith the impression that universal suffrage under our system of\r\ngovernment ensures the rule of the majority. It is this conservative\r\napproval of the Constitution under the guise of sympathy with majority\r\nrule, which has perhaps more than any thing else misled the people as to\r\nthe real spirit and purpose of that instrument. It was by constantly\r\nrepresenting it as the indispensable means of attaining the ends of\r\ndemocracy, that it came to be so generally regarded as the source of all\r\nthat is democratic in our system of government. It is to call attention\r\nto the spirit of the Constitution, its inherent opposition to democracy,\r\nthe obstacles which it has placed in the way of majority rule, that this\r\nvolume has been written.\r\n\r\nThe general recognition of the true character of the Constitution is\r\nnecessary before we can fully understand the nature and origin of our\r\npolitical evils. It would also do much to strengthen and advance the\r\ncause of popular government by bringing us to a realization of the fact\r\nthat the so-called evils of democracy are very largely the natural\r\nresults of those constitutional checks on popular rule which we have\r\ninherited from the political system of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe author acknowledges his indebtedness to his colleague, Professor\r\nWilliam Savery, and to Professor Edward A.

GOVERNMENT OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n\r\nConstitutional government is not necessarily democratic. Usually it is a\r\ncompromise in which monarchical and aristocratic features are retained.\r\nThe proportion in which the old and the new are blended depends, of\r\ncourse, upon the progress the democratic movement has made. Every step\r\ntoward democracy has been stubbornly opposed by the few, who have\r\nyielded to the popular demand, from time to time, only what necessity\r\nrequired. The constitution of the present day is the outcome of this\r\nlong-continued and incessant struggle. It reflects in its form and\r\ncharacter the existing distribution of political power within the state.\r\n\r\nIf we go back far enough we find government nearly everywhere in the\r\nhands of a King and privileged class. In its earlier stages the\r\nconstitutional struggle was between monarchy and aristocracy, the King\r\nseeking to make his authority supreme and the nobility seeking to limit\r\nand circumscribe it. Accordingly, government oscillated between monarchy\r\nand aristocracy, a strong and ambitious King getting the reins of\r\ngovernment largely in his own hands, while the aristocracy encroached\r\nupon the power and prerogatives of a weak and incompetent one. Thus\r\ndemocracy played no part in the earlier constitutional struggles. The\r\nall-important question was whether the King or the nobility should\r\ncontrol the state. Civil wars were waged to decide it, and government\r\ngravitated toward monarchy or aristocracy according as the monarchical\r\nor aristocratic party prevailed.\r\n\r\nUnder William the Conqueror and his immediate successors the government\r\nof England was practically an absolute monarchy. Only the highest class\r\nwas consulted in the Great Council and the advice of these the King was\r\nnot obliged to follow. Later, as a result of the memorable controversy\r\nbetween King John and his feudal barons, the Great Council regained the\r\npower which it had lost. Against the King were arrayed the nobility, the\r\nchurch as represented by its official hierarchy, and the freemen of the\r\nrealm, all together constituting but a small minority of the English\r\npeople. The Great Charter extorted from the King on this occasion,\r\nthough frequently referred to as the foundation of English liberty, was\r\nin reality a matter of but little immediate importance to the common\r\npeople. The benefit of its provisions, while not limited to the\r\nnobility, extended, however, only to those classes without whose aid and\r\nsupport the tyrannical power of the King could not be successfully\r\nopposed. The church, by reason of the great wealth which it controlled\r\nand the powerful influence which it exerted in a superstitious age over\r\nthe minds of the people, was a factor that could not be ignored. The\r\nfreemen also played an important part in the constitutional struggles,\r\nsince they carried the sword and formed the rank and file of the\r\nfighting class. The important provisions of the Great Charter relate\r\nexclusively to the rights of the church, the nobility and the freemen.\r\nThe serfs, while not included within the benefit of its provisions, were\r\nan overwhelming majority of the English people. This conclusion is\r\nirresistible in view of the fact that the Domesday Survey shows that\r\nabout four-fifths of the adult male population in the year 1085 were\r\nbelow the rank of freemen.[1]\r\n\r\nThe Great Charter was, it is true, an important step in the direction of\r\nconstitutional government, but it contained no element of democracy. It\r\nmerely converted the government from one in which monarchy was the\r\npredominant feature, to one in which the aristocratic element was\r\nequally important. The classes represented in the Great Council became a\r\nconstitutional check on the power of the King, inasmuch as he could not\r\nlevy taxes without their consent. The important constitutional position\r\nwhich this charter assigned to the nobility was not maintained,\r\nhowever, without repeated struggles under succeeding Kings; but it laid\r\nthe foundation for the subsequent development which limited and finally\r\nabolished the power of the monarch.\r\n\r\nIn the course of time the Great Council split up into two separate\r\nbodies, the House of Lords, composed of the greater nobility and the\r\nhigher dignitaries of the church, and the House of Commons, representing\r\nall other classes who enjoyed political rights. When the House of\r\nCommons thus assumed a definite and permanent form as a separate body, a\r\nnew check upon the power of the King appeared. The consent of two\r\nseparate bodies was now necessary before taxes could be imposed. The\r\ndevelopment of these checks was hastened by the fact that the King found\r\nit easier and safer to get the assent of these bodies to measures which\r\ninvolved an exercise of the taxing power, than to attempt the collection\r\nof taxes without their support. In this way the right of assenting to\r\nall measures of taxation came in time to be recognized as belonging to\r\nthe two houses of Parliament. But this was a right not easily\r\nestablished. It was claimed and fought for a long time before it finally\r\nbecame a firmly established principle of the English Constitution.\r\nAround the question of taxation centered all the earlier constitutional\r\nstruggles. The power to tax was the one royal prerogative which was\r\nfirst limited. In time Parliament extended its powers and succeeded in\r\nmaking its assent necessary to all governmental acts which vitally\r\naffected the welfare of the nation, whether they involved an exercise of\r\nthe taxing power or not. The law-making power, however, as we understand\r\nit now was seldom employed, the idea of social readjustment through\r\ngeneral legislation being a recent growth. But as revenues were\r\nnecessary, the taxing power was the one legislative function that was\r\nconstantly exercised. It is not strange then that the earlier\r\nconstitutional development should have turned mainly upon the relation\r\nof the various political classes to the exercise of this power.\r\n\r\nThat English constitutional development resulted in a parliament\r\ncomposed of two houses may be regarded as accidental. Instead of this\r\ndouble check upon the King there might conceivably have been more than\r\ntwo, or there might, as originally was the case, have been only one. Two\r\ndistinct elements, the secular nobility and the dignitaries of the\r\nchurch, combined to form the House of Lords. The House of Commons was\r\nalso made up of two distinct constituencies, one urban and the other\r\nrural. If each of these classes had deliberated apart and acquired the\r\nright to assent to legislation as a separate body, a four-chambered\r\nparliament, such as existed in Sweden up to 1866 and still survives in\r\nFinland, would have been the result.[2]\r\n\r\nThe essential fact, everywhere to be observed in the development of\r\nconstitutional government, is the rise to political power of classes\r\nwhich compete with the King and with each other for the control of the\r\nstate. The monopoly of political power enjoyed by the King was broken\r\ndown in England when the nobility compelled the signing of Magna Charta.\r\nThis change in the English Constitution involved the placing of a check\r\nupon the King in the interest of the aristocracy. Later, with the\r\ndevelopment of the House of Commons as a separate institution, the power\r\nof the King was still further limited, this time in the interest of what\r\nwe may call the commercial and industrial aristocracy.\r\n\r\nAt this stage of its development the English government contained a\r\nsystem of checks and balances. The King still retained legislative\r\npower, but could not use it without the consent of both Lords and\r\nCommons. Each branch of the government possessed the means of defending\r\nitself, since it had what was in effect an absolute veto on legislation.\r\nThis is a stage in political evolution through which governments\r\nnaturally pass. It is a form of political organization intermediate\r\nbetween monarchy and democracy, and results from the effort to check and\r\nrestrain, without destroying, the power of the King. When this system\r\nof checks was fully developed the King, Lords and Commons were three\r\ncoordinate branches of the English government. As the concurrence of all\r\nthree was necessary to enact laws, each of these could defeat\r\nlegislation desired by the other two.\r\n\r\nThe development of this system of checks limited the irresponsible power\r\nof the King only on its positive side. The negative power of absolute\r\nveto the King still retained. While he could not enact laws without the\r\nconsent of the other two coordinate branches of the government, he still\r\nhad the power to prevent legislation. The same was true of the Lords and\r\nCommons. As each branch of government had the power to block reform, the\r\nsystem was one which made legislation difficult.\r\n\r\nThe system of checks and balances must not be confused with democracy;\r\nit is opposed to and can not be reconciled with the theory of popular\r\ngovernment. While involving a denial of the right of the King or of any\r\nclass to a free hand in political matters, it at the same time denies\r\nthe right of the masses to direct the policy of the state This would be\r\nthe case even if one branch of the government had the broadest possible\r\nbasis. If the House of Commons had been a truly popular body in the\r\neighteenth century, that fact would not of itself have made the English\r\ngovernment as a whole popular in form. While it would have constituted a\r\npopular check on the King and the House of Lords, it would have been\r\npowerless to express the popular will in legislation.\r\n\r\nThe House of Commons was not, however, a popular body in the eighteenth\r\ncentury. In theory, of course, as a part of Parliament it represented\r\nthe whole English people. But this was a mere political fiction, since\r\nby reason of the narrowly limited suffrage, a large part of the English\r\npeople had no voice in parliamentary elections. Probably not one-fifth\r\nof the adult male population was entitled to vote for members of\r\nParliament. As the right to vote was an incident of land ownership, the\r\nHouse of Commons was largely representative of the same interests that\r\ncontrolled the House of Lords.\r\n\r\nThat the House of Commons was not democratic in spirit is clearly seen\r\nin the character of parliamentary legislation. The laws enacted during\r\nthis period were distinctly undemocratic. While the interests of the\r\nland-holding aristocracy were carefully guarded, the well-being of the\r\nlaboring population received scant consideration. The poor laws, the\r\nenclosure acts and the corn laws, which had in view the prosperity of\r\nthe landlord, and the laws against combination, which sought to advance\r\nthe interests of the capitalist at the expense of the laborer, show the\r\nspirit of the English government prior to the parliamentary reform of\r\n1832. The landlord and capitalist classes controlled the government and,\r\nas Professor Rogers observes, their aim was to increase rents and\r\nprofits by grinding the English workman down to the lowest pittance. \"I\r\ncontend,\" he says, \"that from 1563 to 1824, a conspiracy, concocted by\r\nthe law and carried out by parties interested in its success, was\r\nentered into, to cheat the English workman of his wages, to tie him to\r\nthe soil, to deprive him of hope, and to degrade him into irremediable\r\npoverty.\"[3]\r\n\r\nBut it is not in statute law alone that this tendency is seen. English\r\ncommon law shows the same bias in favor of the classes which then\r\ncontrolled the state. There is no mistaking the influences which left\r\ntheir impress upon the development of English law at the hands of the\r\ncourts. The effect of wealth and political privilege is seen here as\r\nwell as in statutory enactment. Granting all that can justly be said in\r\nbehalf of the wisdom and reasonableness of the common law, the fact\r\nnevertheless remains, that its development by the courts has been\r\ninfluenced by an evident disposition to favor the possessing as against\r\nthe non-possessing classes. Both the common and the statute law of\r\nEngland reflected in the eighteenth century the political supremacy of\r\nthe well-to-do minority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT OF THE REVOLUTIONARY PERIOD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe American colonists inherited the common law and the political\r\ninstitutions of the mother country. The British form of government, with\r\nits King, Lords and Commons and its checks upon the people, they\r\naccepted as a matter of course. In their political thinking they were\r\nnot consciously more democratic than their kinsmen across the Atlantic.\r\nMany of them, it is true, had left England to escape what they regarded\r\nas tyranny and oppression. But to the _form_ of the English government\r\nas such they had no objection. The evils which they experienced were\r\nattributed solely to the selfish spirit in which the government was\r\nadministered.\r\n\r\nThe conditions, however, were more favorable for the development of a\r\ndemocratic spirit here than in the mother country. The immigrants to\r\nAmerica represented the more active, enterprising and dissatisfied\r\nelements of the English people. Moreover, there was no hereditary\r\naristocratic class in the colonies and less inequality in the\r\ndistribution of wealth. This approach to industrial and social equality\r\nprepared the mind for the ideas of political equality which needed only\r\nthe stimulus of a favorable opportunity to ensure their speedy\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nThis opportunity came with the outbreak of the American Revolution which\r\nat the outset was merely an organized and armed protest against what the\r\ncolonies regarded as an arbitrary and unconstitutional exercise of the\r\ntaxing power. As there was no widespread or general dissatisfaction with\r\nthe _form_ of the English government, there is scarcely room for doubt\r\nthat if England had shown a more prudent and conciliatory spirit toward\r\nthe colonies, the American Revolution would have been averted. No\r\nsooner, however, had the controversy with the mother country reached the\r\nacute revolutionary stage, than the forces which had been silently and\r\nunconsciously working toward democracy, found an opportunity for\r\npolitical expression. The spirit of resistance to what was regarded as\r\nunconstitutional taxation rapidly assumed the form of avowed opposition\r\nto the English Constitution itself. The people were ready for a larger\r\nmeasure of political democracy than the English Constitution of the\r\neighteenth century permitted. To this new and popular view of government\r\nthe Declaration of Independence gave expression. It contained an\r\nemphatic, formal and solemn disavowal of the political theory embodied\r\nin the English Constitution; affirmed that \"all men are created equal;\"\r\nthat governments derive \"their just powers from the consent of the\r\ngoverned;\" and declared the right of the people to alter or to abolish\r\nthe form of the government \"and to institute new government, laying its\r\nfoundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as\r\nto them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.\"\r\nThis was a complete and sweeping repudiation of the English political\r\nsystem, which recognized the right of monarchy and aristocracy to thwart\r\nthe will of the people.\r\n\r\nTo what extent the Declaration of Independence voiced the general\r\nsentiment of the colonies is largely a matter of conjecture. It is\r\nprobable, however, that its specification of grievances and its vigorous\r\narraignment of the colonial policy of the English government appealed to\r\nmany who had little sympathy with its express and implied advocacy of\r\ndemocracy. It is doubtless true that many were carried along with the\r\nrevolutionary movement who by temperament and education were strongly\r\nattached to English political traditions. It is safe to conclude that a\r\nlarge proportion of those who desired to see American independence\r\nestablished did not believe in thoroughgoing political democracy.\r\n\r\nBesides those who desired independence without being in sympathy with\r\nthe political views expressed in the Declaration of Independence, there\r\nwere many others who were opposed to the whole Revolutionary movement.\r\nThe numerical strength of the Tories can not be accurately estimated;\r\nbut it is certain that a large proportion, probably not less than\r\none-third of the total population of the colonies, did not approve of\r\nthe war.[4]\r\n\r\n\"In the first place, there was, prior to 1776, the official class; that\r\nis, the men holding various positions in the civil and military and\r\nnaval services of the government, their immediate families, and their\r\nsocial connections. All such persons may be described as inclining to\r\nthe Loyalist view in consequence of official bias.\r\n\r\n\"Next were certain colonial politicians who, it may be admitted, took a\r\nrather selfish and an unprincipled view of the whole dispute, and who,\r\ncounting on the probable, if not inevitable, success of the British arms\r\nin such a conflict, adopted the Loyalist side, not for conscience' sake,\r\nbut for profit's sake, and in the expectation of being rewarded for\r\ntheir fidelity by offices and titles, and especially by the confiscated\r\nestates of the rebels after the rebels themselves should have been\r\ndefeated, and their leaders hanged or sent into exile.\r\n\r\n\"As composing still another class of Tories, may be mentioned probably a\r\nvast majority of those who stood for the commercial interests, for the\r\ncapital and tangible property of the country, and who, with the\r\ninstincts natural to persons who have something considerable to lose,\r\ndisapproved of all measures for pushing the dispute to the point of\r\ndisorder, riot and civil war.\r\n\r\n\"Still another class of Loyalists was made up of people of professional\r\ntraining and occupation--clergymen, physicians, lawyers, teachers--a\r\nclear majority of whom seem to have been set against the ultimate\r\nmeasures of the Revolution.\r\n\r\n\"Finally, and in general, it may be said that a majority of those who,\r\nof whatever occupation, of whatever grade of culture or of wealth, would\r\nnow be described as conservative people, were Loyalists during the\r\nAmerican Revolution.\"[5]\r\n\r\nThese classes prior to the Revolution had largely shaped and molded\r\npublic opinion; but their opposition to the movement which they were\r\npowerless to prevent, destroyed their influence, for the time being, in\r\nAmerican politics. The place which they had hitherto held in public\r\nesteem was filled by a new class of leaders more in sympathy with the\r\nnewly born spirit of liberalism. This gave to the revolutionary movement\r\na distinctly democratic character.\r\n\r\nThis drift toward democracy is seen in the changes made in the state\r\nconstitutions after the outbreak of the Revolution. At the close of the\r\ncolonial period, nearly all the state governments were modeled after the\r\ngovernment of Great Britain. Each colony had its legislative body\r\nelected by the qualified voters and corresponding in a general way to\r\nthe House of Commons. In all the colonies except Pennsylvania and\r\nGeorgia there was also an upper legislative house or council whose\r\nconsent was necessary before laws could be enacted. The members\r\ncomposing this branch of the legislature were appointed by the governor\r\nexcept in Massachusetts where they were elected by the lower branch of\r\nthe legislature, subject to a negative by the royal governor, and in\r\nRhode Island and Connecticut where they were chosen by the electorate.\r\n\r\nThe governor was elected by the voters only in Rhode Island and\r\nConnecticut; in all the other colonies he was appointed by the\r\nproprietaries or the Crown, and, though independent of the people,\r\nexercised many important powers. He was commander-in-chief of the armed\r\nforces of the colony; appointed the judges and all other civil and\r\nmilitary officers; appointed and could suspend the council, which was\r\nusually the upper branch of the legislature; he could convene and\r\ndissolve the legislature and had besides an unqualified veto on all\r\nlaws; he also had an unrestricted pardoning power.\r\n\r\nThe possession of these far-reaching powers gave to the irresponsible\r\nexecutive branch of the colonial government a position of commanding\r\nimportance. This was not the case, however, in Connecticut and Rhode\r\nIsland. Although the governor in these two colonies was responsible to\r\nthe voters, inasmuch as he was elected by them, still he had no veto,\r\nand the appointing power was in the hands of the legislature.\r\n\r\nThe tidal-wave of democracy, which swept over the colonies during the\r\nRevolution, largely effaced the monarchical and aristocratic features of\r\nthe colonial governments. Connecticut and Rhode Island, which already\r\nhad democratic constitutions, were the only states which did not modify\r\ntheir form of government during this period. All the rest adopted new\r\nconstitutions which show in a marked degree the influence of the\r\ndemocratic movement. In these new constitutions we see a strong tendency\r\nto subordinate the executive branch of the government and confer all\r\nimportant powers on the legislature. In the four New England states and\r\nin New York the governor was elected by the qualified voters; in all the\r\nrest he was chosen by the legislature. In ten states during this period\r\nhis term of office was one year; in South Carolina it was two and in New\r\nYork and Delaware it was three years. In addition to this the six\r\nSouthern states restricted his re-election. Besides, there was in every\r\nstate an executive or privy council which the governor was required to\r\nconsult on all important matters. This was usually appointed by the\r\nlegislature and constituted an important check on the governor.\r\n\r\nThe power to veto legislation was abolished in all but two states. In\r\nMassachusetts the governor, and in New York the Council of Revision\r\ncomposed of the governor and the chancellor and judges of the Supreme\r\nCourt, had a qualified veto power. But a two-thirds majority in both\r\nhouses of the legislature could override the veto of the governor in\r\nMassachusetts, or that of the Council of Revision in New York. The\r\npardoning power of the governor was quite generally restricted. In five\r\nstates he was allowed to exercise it only with the advice or consent of\r\nthe council.[6] In three states, where the advice or consent of a\r\ncouncil was not required, he could, subject to certain restrictions,\r\ngrant pardons except where \"the law shall otherwise direct.\"[7] The\r\nconstitution of Georgia in express terms deprived the governor of all\r\nright to exercise this power.\r\n\r\nThe appointing power of the governor was also taken away or restricted.\r\nIn four of the eleven states adopting new constitutions during this\r\nperiod he was allowed to exercise it jointly with the council.[8] In six\r\nstates it was given to the legislature, or to the legislature and\r\ncouncil.[9] The power of the governor to dissolve the legislature or\r\neither branch of it was everywhere abolished.\r\n\r\nThe supremacy of the legislature under these early state constitutions\r\nis seen also in the manner of appointment, the tenure and the powers of\r\nthe judiciary. In nine states[10] the judges were elected by the state\r\nlegislature, either with or without the consent of a council. In\r\nMaryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Pennsylvania they were\r\nappointed by the governor with the consent of the council. But this\r\nreally amounted to indirect legislative appointment in Maryland, since\r\nboth the governor and council in that state were elected annually by the\r\nlegislature. The legislature also had a voice in the appointment of\r\njudges in Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and Massachusetts, since it\r\nelected the executive in the first and the council in the others. In\r\nnine states, then, the judges were elected directly by the legislature;\r\nin one indirectly by the legislature; in the other three the legislature\r\nparticipated in their election through an executive or a council of its\r\nown choosing.\r\n\r\nIn every state the judges could be impeached by the lower branch of the\r\nlegislature and expelled from office on conviction by the senate or\r\nother tribunal, as the constitution prescribed. Moreover, in six\r\nstates[11] they could be removed according to the English custom by the\r\nexecutive on an address from both branches of the legislature. The term\r\nof office of the judges in eight states[12] was during good behavior. In\r\nNew Jersey and Pennsylvania they were appointed for seven years, and in\r\nRhode Island, Connecticut, and Georgia they were chosen annually.\r\n\r\nThe legislature under these early state constitutions was hampered\r\nneither by the executive nor by the courts. It had all law-making power\r\nin its own hands. In no state could the courts thwart its purpose by\r\ndeclaring its acts null and void. Unchecked by either executive or\r\njudicial veto its supremacy was undisputed.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing synopsis of the state constitutions of this period it\r\nis evident that their framers rejected entirely the English theory of\r\nchecks and balances. The principle of separation of powers as expounded\r\nby Montesquieu and Blackstone, found little favor with those who\r\ncontrolled American politics at this time. Instead of trying to\r\nconstruct a state government composed of coordinate branches, each\r\nacting as a check upon the others, their aim was to make the legislature\r\nsupreme. In this respect the early state constitutions anticipated much\r\nof the later development of the English government itself.\r\n\r\nThe checks and balances, and separation of powers, which characterized\r\nthe government of England and her American colonies in the eighteenth\r\ncentury, resulted from the composite character of the English\r\nConstitution--its mixture of monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy. It is\r\nnot surprising, then, that with the temporary ascendency of the\r\ndemocratic spirit, the system of checks should have been largely\r\ndiscarded.\r\n\r\nThis democratic tendency is seen also in our first federal constitution,\r\nthe Articles of Confederation, which was framed under the impulse of the\r\nRevolutionary movement. This document is interesting as an expression of\r\nthe political philosophy of the Revolution; but like the state\r\nconstitutions of that period, it has had few friendly critics among\r\nlater political writers. Much emphasis has been put upon its defects,\r\nwhich were many, while but little attention has been given to the\r\npolitical theory which it imperfectly embodied. That it failed to\r\nprovide a satisfactory general government may be admitted; but this\r\nresult must not be accepted as conclusive proof that the principles\r\nunderlying it were altogether false.\r\n\r\nThe chief feature of the Articles of Confederation was the entire\r\nabsence of checks and balances. All the powers conferred upon the\r\ngeneral government were vested in a single legislative body called the\r\nContinental Congress, which was unchecked by a distinct executive or\r\njudiciary. In this respect it bore a striking resemblance to the English\r\ngovernment of to-day with its omnipotent House of Commons. But, unlike\r\nthe English government of to-day, its powers were few and narrowly\r\nlimited. Its failure was due, perhaps, not to the fact that the powers\r\ngranted to the confederation were vested exclusively in a single\r\nlegislative body, but to the fact that the powers thus granted were not\r\nsufficient for maintaining a strong and effective central government.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the weakness of the general government under the Articles\r\nof Confederation is obvious to the student of American history. It was\r\nonly gradually, and as necessity compelled cooperation between the\r\ncolonies, that the sentiment in favor of political union developed. And\r\nthough some tendencies in this direction are seen more than a century\r\nbefore the American Revolution, the progress toward a permanent union\r\nwas slow and only the pressure of political necessity finally brought it\r\nabout.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1643 Massachusetts, Plymouth, Connecticut and New Haven\r\nformed a \"perpetual confederation\" under the name of the \"United\r\nColonies of New England.\" The motive for this union was mainly offence\r\nand defence against the Indian tribes and the Dutch, though provision\r\nwas also made for the extradition of servants and fugitives from\r\njustice. The management of the common interests of these colonies was\r\nvested in a board of eight commissioners--two from each colony--and, in\r\ntransacting the business of the confederacy, the consent of six of the\r\neight commissioners was required. Any matter which could not be thus\r\ndisposed of was to be referred to the four colonial legislatures. The\r\ngeneral government thus provided for could not inter-meddle \"with the\r\ngovernment of any of the jurisdictions.\" No provision was made for\r\namending the \"Articles of Confederation,\" and only by the unanimous\r\nconsent of these colonies could any other colony be admitted to the\r\nconfederacy. This union lasted for over forty years.[13]\r\n\r\nAgain in 1754 the pressure of impending war with the French and Indians\r\nbrought together at Albany a convention of delegates from seven colonies\r\nnorth of the Potomac. A plan of union drafted by Benjamin Franklin was\r\nrecommended by this convention, but it was not regarded with favor\r\neither by the colonies or by the English government. The former regarded\r\nit as going too far in the direction of subordinating the separate\r\ncolonies to a central colonial authority, while for the latter it was\r\ntoo democratic.[14]\r\n\r\nThe union of all the colonies under the Articles of Confederation was\r\nfinally brought about through the pressure of military necessity during\r\nthe Revolution. Nor is it surprising, in view of the history of the\r\nAmerican colonies, that they reluctantly yielded up any powers to a\r\ncentral authority. We must bear in mind that the Revolution was in a\r\nmeasure a democratic movement, and that democracy was then found only in\r\nlocal government. The general governments of all countries were at that\r\ntime monarchical or aristocratic. Tyranny in the eighteenth century was\r\nassociated in the minds of the people with an undue extension or abuse\r\nof the powers exercised by the undemocratic central government. It is\r\nnot surprising, then, that the Revolutionary federal constitution, the\r\nArticles of Confederation, should have failed to provide a general\r\ngovernment sufficiently strong to satisfy the needs of the country after\r\nthe return of peace.\r\n\r\nIt must not be inferred, however, that the political changes which\r\nimmediately followed the outbreak of the Revolution were in the nature\r\nof sweeping democratic reforms. Much that was thoroughly undemocratic\r\nremained intact. The property qualifications for the suffrage were not\r\ndisturbed by the Revolutionary movement and were finally abolished only\r\nafter the lapse of nearly half a century. The cruel and barbarous system\r\nof imprisonment for debt which the colonies had inherited from England,\r\nand which often made the lot of the unfortunate debtor worse than that\r\nof the chattel slave, continued in several of the states until long\r\nafter the Revolution. Marked as was the democratic tendency during the\r\nfirst few years of our independence, it nevertheless left untouched much\r\nthat the progress of democracy has since abolished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE CONSTITUTION A REACTIONARY DOCUMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sweeping changes made in our form of government after the\r\nDeclaration of Independence were clearly revolutionary in character. The\r\nEnglish system of checks and balances was discarded for the more\r\ndemocratic one under which all the important powers of government were\r\nvested in the legislature. This new scheme of government was not,\r\nhowever, truly representative of the political thought of the colonies.\r\nThe conservative classes who in ordinary times are a powerful factor in\r\nthe politics of every community had, by reason of their Loyalist views,\r\nno voice in this political reorganization; and these, as we have seen,\r\nnot only on account of their wealth and intelligence, but on the basis\r\nof their numerical strength as well, were entitled to considerable\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nWith the return of peace these classes which so largely represented the\r\nwealth and culture of the colonies, regained in a measure the influence\r\nwhich they had lost. This tended strongly to bring about a conservative\r\nreaction. There was besides another large class which supported the\r\nRevolutionary movement without being in sympathy with its democratic\r\ntendencies. This also used its influence to undo the work of the\r\nRevolutionary radicals. Moreover, many of those who had espoused\r\ndemocratic doctrines during the Revolution became conservatives after\r\nthe war was over.[15] These classes were naturally opposed to the new\r\npolitical doctrines which the Revolutionary movement had incorporated in\r\nthe American government. The \"hard times\" and general discontent which\r\nfollowed the war also contributed to the reactionary movement; since\r\nmany were led to believe that evils which were the natural result of\r\nother causes were due to an excess of democracy. Consequently we find\r\nthe democratic tendency which manifested itself with the outbreak of the\r\nRevolution giving place a few years later to the political reaction\r\nwhich found expression in our present Constitution.\r\n\r\n\"The United States are the offspring of a long-past age. A hundred\r\nyears, it is true, have scarcely passed since the eighteenth century\r\ncame to its end, but no hundred years in the history of the world has\r\never before hurried it along so far over new paths and into unknown\r\nfields. The French Revolution and the First Empire were the bridge\r\nbetween two periods that nothing less than the remaking of European\r\nsociety, the recasting of European politics, could have brought so near.\r\n\r\n\"But back to this eighteenth century must we go to learn the forces, the\r\nnational ideas, the political theories, under the domination of which\r\nthe Constitution of the United States was framed and adopted.\"[16]\r\n\r\nIt is the general belief, nevertheless, that the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States is the very embodiment of democratic philosophy. The\r\npeople take it for granted that the framers of that document were imbued\r\nwith the spirit of political equality and sought to establish a\r\ngovernment by the people themselves. Widely as this view is entertained,\r\nit is, however, at variance with the facts.\r\n\r\n\"Scarcely any of these men [the framers of the Constitution]\r\nentertained,\" says Fiske, \"what we should now call extreme democratic\r\nviews. Scarcely any, perhaps, had that intense faith in the ultimate\r\ngood sense of the people which was the most powerful characteristic of\r\nJefferson.\"[17]\r\n\r\nDemocracy--government by the people, or directly responsible to\r\nthem--was not the object which the framers of the American Constitution\r\nhad in view, but the very thing which they wished to avoid. In the\r\nconvention which drafted that instrument it was recognized that\r\ndemocratic ideas had made sufficient progress among the masses to put an\r\ninsurmountable obstacle in the way of any plan of government which did\r\nnot confer at least the form of political power upon the people.\r\nAccordingly the efforts of the Constitutional Convention were directed\r\nto the task of devising a system of government which was just popular\r\nenough not to excite general opposition and which at the same time gave\r\nto the people as little as possible of the substance of political power.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat strange that the American people know so little of the\r\nfundamental nature of their system of government. Their acquaintance\r\nwith it extends only to its outward form and rarely includes a knowledge\r\nof the political philosophy upon which it rests. The sources of\r\ninformation upon which the average man relies do not furnish the data\r\nfor a correct understanding of the Constitution. The ordinary text-books\r\nand popular works upon this subject leave the reader with an entirely\r\nerroneous impression. Even the writings of our constitutional lawyers\r\ndeal with the outward form rather than the spirit of our government. The\r\nvital question--the extent to which, under our constitutional\r\narrangements, the people were expected to, and as a matter of fact do,\r\ncontrol legislation and public policy, is either not referred to, or\r\nelse discussed in a superficial and unsatisfactory manner. That this\r\nfeature of our Constitution should receive more attention than it does\r\nis evident when we reflect that a government works well in practice in\r\nproportion as its underlying philosophy and constitutional forms are\r\ncomprehended by those who wield political power.\r\n\r\n\"It has been common,\" says a late Justice of the United States Supreme\r\nCourt, \"to designate our form of government as a democracy, but in the\r\ntrue sense in which that term is properly used, as defining a government\r\nin which all its acts are performed by the people, it is about as far\r\nfrom it as any other of which we are aware.\"[18]\r\n\r\nIn the United States at the present time we are trying to make an\r\nundemocratic Constitution the vehicle of democratic rule. Our\r\nConstitution embodies the political philosophy of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, not that of to-day. It was framed for one purpose while we are\r\ntrying to use it for another. Is free government, then, being tried here\r\nunder the conditions most favorable to its success? This question we can\r\nanswer only when we have considered our Constitution as a means to the\r\nattainment of democratic rule.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to understand how anyone who has read the proceedings of\r\nthe Federal Convention can believe that it was the intention of that\r\nbody to establish a democratic government. The evidence is overwhelming\r\nthat the men who sat in that convention had no faith in the wisdom or\r\npolitical capacity of the people. Their aim and purpose was not to\r\nsecure a larger measure of democracy, but to eliminate as far as\r\npossible the direct influence of the people on legislation and public\r\npolicy. That body, it is true, contained many illustrious men who were\r\nactuated by a desire to further what they conceived to be the welfare of\r\nthe country. They represented, however, the wealthy and conservative\r\nclasses, and had for the most part but little sympathy with the popular\r\ntheory of government.\r\n\r\n\"Hardly one among them but had sat in some famous assembly, had signed\r\nsome famous document, had filled some high place, or had made himself\r\nconspicuous for learning, for scholarship, or for signal services\r\nrendered in the cause of liberty. One had framed the Albany plan of\r\nunion; some had been members of the Stamp Act Congress of 1765; some had\r\nsigned the Declaration of Rights in 1774; the names of others appear at\r\nthe foot of the Declaration of Independence and at the foot of the\r\nArticles of Confederation; two had been presidents of Congress; seven\r\nhad been, or were then, governors of states; twenty-eight had been\r\nmembers of Congress; one had commanded the armies of the United States;\r\nanother had been Superintendent of Finance; a third had repeatedly been\r\nsent on important missions to England, and had long been Minister to\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\n\"Nor were the future careers of many of them to be less interesting than\r\ntheir past. Washington and Madison became Presidents of the United\r\nStates; Elbridge Gerry became Vice-President; Charles Cotesworth\r\nPinckney and Rufus King became candidates for the Presidency, and Jared\r\nIngersoll, Rufus King, and John Langdon candidates for the\r\nVice-Presidency; Hamilton became Secretary of the Treasury; Madison,\r\nSecretary of State; Randolph, Attorney-General and Secretary of State,\r\nand James McHenry, a Secretary of War; Ellsworth and Rutledge became\r\nChief-Justices; Wilson and John Blair rose to the Supreme bench;\r\nGouverneur Morris, and Ellsworth, and Charles C. Pinckney, and Gerry,\r\nand William Davie became Ministers abroad.\"[19]\r\n\r\nThe long list of distinguished men who took part in the deliberations of\r\nthat body is noteworthy, however, for the absence of such names as\r\nSamuel Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Thomas Paine, Patrick Henry and other\r\ndemocratic leaders of that time. The Federal Convention assembled in\r\nPhiladelphia only eleven years after the Declaration of Independence was\r\nsigned, yet only six of the fifty-six men who signed that document were\r\namong its members.[20] Conservatism and thorough distrust of popular\r\ngovernment characterized throughout the proceedings of that convention.\r\nDemocracy, Elbridge Gerry thought, was the worst of all political\r\nevils.[21] Edmund Randolph observed that in tracing the political evils\r\nof this country to their origin, \"every man [in the Convention] had\r\nfound it in the turbulence and follies of democracy.\"[22] These views\r\nappear to reflect the general opinion of that body. Still they realized\r\nthat it was not the part of wisdom to give public expression to this\r\ncontempt for democracy. The doors were closed to the public and the\r\nutmost secrecy maintained with regard to the proceedings. Members were\r\nnot allowed to communicate with any one outside of that body concerning\r\nthe matters therein discussed, nor were they permitted, except by a vote\r\nof the Convention, to copy anything from the journals.[23]\r\n\r\nIt must be borne in mind that the Convention was called for the purpose\r\nof proposing amendments to the Articles of Confederation. The delegates\r\nwere not authorized to frame a new constitution. Their appointment\r\ncontemplated changes which were to perfect the Articles of Confederation\r\nwithout destroying the general form of government which they\r\nestablished. The resolution of Congress of February 21, 1787, which\r\nauthorized the Federal Convention, limited its business to \"the sole and\r\nexpress purpose of revising the Articles of Confederation,\" and the\r\nstates of New York, Massachusetts, and Connecticut copied this in the\r\ninstructions to their delegates.[24] The aim of the Convention, however,\r\nfrom the very start was not amendment, but a complete rejection of the\r\nsystem itself, which was regarded as incurably defective.\r\n\r\nThis view was well expressed by James Wilson in his speech made in favor\r\nof the ratification of the Constitution before the Pennsylvania\r\nconvention.\r\n\r\n\"The business, we are told, which was entrusted to the late Convention,\"\r\nhe said, \"was merely to amend the present Articles of Confederation.\r\nThis observation has been frequently made, and has often brought to my\r\nmind a story that is related of Mr. Pope, who, it is well known, was not\r\na little deformed. It was customary with him to use this phrase, 'God\r\nmend me!' when any little accident happened. One evening a link-boy was\r\nlighting him along, and, coming to a gutter, the boy jumped nimbly over\r\nit. Mr Pope called to him to turn, adding, 'God mend me!' The arch\r\nrogue, turning to light him, looked at him, and repeated, 'God mend you!\r\nHe would sooner make half-a-dozen new ones.' This would apply to the\r\npresent Confederation; for it would be easier to make another than to\r\namend this.\"[25]\r\n\r\nThe popular notion that this Convention in framing the Constitution was\r\nactuated solely by a desire to impart more vigor and efficiency to the\r\ngeneral government is but a part of the truth. The Convention desired to\r\nestablish not only a strong and vigorous central government, but one\r\nwhich would at the same time possess great stability or freedom from\r\nchange. This last reason is seldom mentioned in our constitutional\r\nliterature, yet it had a most important bearing on the work of the\r\nConvention. This desired stability the government under the\r\nConfederation did not possess, since it was, in the opinion of the\r\nmembers of the Convention, dangerously responsive to public opinion;\r\nhence their desire to supplant it with an elaborate system of\r\nconstitutional checks. The adoption of this system was the triumph of a\r\nskillfully directed reactionary movement.\r\n\r\nOf course the spirit and intention of the Convention must be gathered\r\nnot from the statements and arguments addressed to the general public in\r\nfavor of the ratification of the Constitution, but from what occurred in\r\nthe Convention itself. The discussions which took place in that body\r\nindicate the real motives and purposes of those who framed the\r\nConstitution. These were carefully withheld from the people and it was\r\nnot until long afterward that they were accessible to students of the\r\nAmerican Constitution. The preamble began with, \"We, the people,\" but it\r\nwas the almost unanimous sentiment of the Convention that the less the\r\npeople had to do with the government the better. Hamilton wanted to give\r\nthe rich and well born \"a distinct, permanent share in the\r\ngovernment.\"[26] Madison thought the government ought \"to protect the\r\nminority of the opulent against the majority.\"[27] The prevalence of\r\nsuch views in this Convention reminds one of Adam Smith's statement,\r\nmade a few years before in his \"Wealth of Nations,\" that \"civil\r\ngovernment, so far as it is instituted for the security of property, is\r\nin reality instituted for the defence of the rich against the poor, or\r\nof those who have some property against those who have none at all.\"[28]\r\nThe solicitude shown by the members of this convention for the interests\r\nof the well-to-do certainly tends to justify Adam Smith's observation.\r\n\r\nThe framers of the Constitution realized, however, that it would not do\r\nto carry this system of checks upon the people too far. It was necessary\r\nthat the government should retain something of the _form_ of democracy,\r\nif it was to command the respect and confidence of the people. For this\r\nreason Gerry thought that \"the people should appoint one branch of the\r\ngovernment in order to inspire them with the necessary confidence.\"[29]\r\nMadison also saw that the necessary sympathy between the people and\r\ntheir rulers and officers must be maintained and that \"the policy of\r\nrefining popular appointments by successive filtrations\" might be pushed\r\ntoo far.[30] These discussions, which took place behind closed doors and\r\nunder pledge of secrecy, may be taken as fairly representing what the\r\nframers of our Constitution really thought of popular government. Their\r\npublic utterances, on the other hand, influenced as they necessarily\r\nwere, by considerations of public policy, are of little value. From all\r\nthe evidence which we have, the conclusion is irresistible that they\r\nsought to establish a form of government which would effectually curb\r\nand restrain democracy. They engrafted upon the Constitution just so\r\nmuch of the features of popular government as was, in their opinion,\r\nnecessary to ensure its adoption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE AMENDMENT FEATURE OF THE CONSTITUTION\r\n\r\n\r\nAll democratic constitutions are flexible and easy to amend. This\r\nfollows from the fact that in a government which the people really\r\ncontrol, a constitution is merely the means of securing the supremacy of\r\npublic opinion and not an instrument for thwarting it. Such a\r\nconstitution can not be regarded as a check upon the people themselves.\r\nIt is a device for securing to them that necessary control over their\r\nagents and representatives, without which popular government exists only\r\nin name. A government is democratic just in proportion as it responds to\r\nthe will of the people; and since one way of defeating the will of the\r\npeople is to make it difficult to alter the form of government, it\r\nnecessarily follows that any constitution which is democratic in spirit\r\nmust yield readily to changes in public opinion.\r\n\r\nMonarchical and aristocratic constitutions on the other hand are always\r\nextremely conservative. Inasmuch as they express the opinion and\r\nguarantee the privileges of a dominant class, they are bulwarks erected\r\nagainst popular change. The privileged classes of any society regard\r\nstability as the chief political desideratum. They resist, and if\r\npossible prevent, those legal and political readjustments which the\r\ngeneral progress of society makes necessary. Their interests are\r\nfurthered in proportion as the system is one which renders change\r\ndifficult.\r\n\r\nWith this distinction in mind let us examine the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States. Was it the intention of the framers of this instrument\r\nthat it should be merely a check upon the governmental machinery with\r\nthe view of establishing popular control over it, or was it expected to\r\nconstitute a check upon the people themselves? That it was not intended\r\nthat the people should be given direct and complete control over the\r\ngeneral policy of the government is clear from the fact that the\r\nConstitution was made so difficult to amend; for the right to control\r\nthe political machinery, implies of necessity the right to make such\r\nchanges in it from time to time, as are needed to make this control\r\neffective. It is evident from the views expressed in the Convention that\r\none object of the Constitution was to secure stability by placing the\r\ngovernment beyond the direct influence of public opinion.\r\n\r\nMadison, who has been called the \"father of the Constitution,\" thought\r\nit \"ought to secure the permanent interests of the country against\r\ninnovation.\"[31] Hamilton said \"all communities divide themselves into\r\nthe few and the many. The first are the rich and well born, the other\r\nthe mass of the people ... [the latter] are turbulent and changing; they\r\nseldom judge or determine right.\" Therefore he advocated a permanent\r\nsenate which would be able to \"check the imprudence of democracy.\"[32]\r\nGouverneur Morris observed that \"the first branch [of the proposed\r\nFederal Congress], originating from the people, will ever be subject to\r\n_precipitancy_, _changeability_, and _excess_.... This can only be\r\nchecked by _ability_ and _virtue_ in the second branch ... [which] ought\r\nto be composed of men of great and established property--_aristocracy_;\r\nmen who, from pride, will support consistency and permanency; and to\r\nmake them completely independent, they must be chosen _for life_, or\r\nthey will be a useless body. Such an aristocratic body will keep down\r\nthe turbulence of democracy.\"[33]\r\n\r\nThis dread of the consequences of popular government was shared to a\r\ngreater or less extent by nearly all the members of that Convention.\r\nTheir aim was to find a cure for what they conceived to be the evils of\r\nan excess of democracy.\r\n\r\n\"Complaints,\" says Madison in _The Federalist_, \"are everywhere heard\r\nfrom our most considerate and virtuous citizens, equally the friends of\r\npublic and private faith, and of public and personal liberty, that our\r\ngovernments are too unstable, that the public good is disregarded in the\r\nconflicts of rival parties, and that measures are too often decided, not\r\naccording to the rules of justice and the rights of the minor party, but\r\nby the superior force of an interested and overbearing majority.\"[34]\r\n\r\nThis criticism of the American government of the Revolutionary period\r\ngives us the point of view of the framers of the Constitution. We should\r\nremember, however, that the so-called majority rule to which Madison\r\nattributed the evils of that time had nothing in common with majority\r\nrule as that term is now understood. Under the laws then in force the\r\nsuffrage was greatly restricted, while the high property qualifications\r\nrequired for office-holding had the effect in many cases of placing the\r\ncontrol of legislation in the hands of the wealthier part of the\r\ncommunity. But undemocratic as the system was, it was not sufficiently\r\nundemocratic to suit the framers of the Constitution. It was no part of\r\ntheir plan to establish a government which the people could control. In\r\nfact, popular control was what they were seeking to avoid. One means of\r\naccomplishing this was to make amendment difficult, and this accordingly\r\nwas done. We need not be surprised that no provision was made for its\r\noriginal adoption, or subsequent amendment by direct popular vote.[35]\r\n\r\nThe fact that the people can not directly propose, or even ratify\r\nchanges in the fundamental law, is a substantial check upon democracy.\r\nBut in addition to this, another check was provided in the extraordinary\r\nmajority necessary to amend the Constitution. That it requires a\r\ntwo-thirds majority of both houses of Congress, or an application from\r\nthe legislature in two-thirds of the states to merely set the machinery\r\nfor constitutional amendment in motion, and that it requires for\r\nratification of amendments proposed, the assent of legislatures or\r\nconventions in three-fourths of the states, ought to give one some idea\r\nof the extreme difficulty of changing our Constitution.\r\n\r\nPatrick Henry clearly saw that this lack of adequate provision for\r\namendment was destructive of democracy. In the Virginia convention held\r\nto ratify the Constitution he said:\r\n\r\n\"To encourage us to adopt it, they tell us that there is a plain, easy\r\nway of getting amendments. When I come to contemplate this part, I\r\nsuppose that I am mad, or that my countrymen are so. The way to\r\namendment is, in my conception, shut ...\" After quoting Article V (the\r\namendment feature of the Constitution), he continues:\r\n\r\n\"Hence it appears that three-fourths of the states must ultimately agree\r\nto any amendments that may be necessary. Let us consider the consequence\r\nof this.... Let us suppose--for the case is supposable, possible and\r\nprobable--that you happen to deal those powers to unworthy hands; will\r\nthey relinquish powers already in their possession, or agree to\r\namendments? Two-thirds of Congress, or of the state legislatures, are\r\nnecessary even to propose amendments. If one-third of these be unworthy\r\nmen, they may prevent the application for amendments; but what is\r\ndestructive and mischievous, is, that three-fourths of the state\r\nlegislatures, or of the state conventions, must concur in the amendments\r\nwhen proposed! In such numerous bodies, there must necessarily be some\r\ndesigning, bad men. To suppose that so large a number as three-fourths\r\nof the states will concur, is to suppose that they will possess genius,\r\nintelligence, and integrity, approaching to miraculous.... For four of\r\nthe smallest states, that do not collectively contain one-tenth part of\r\nthe population of the United States, may obstruct the most salutary and\r\nnecessary amendments. Nay, in these four states, six-tenths of the\r\npeople may reject these amendments.... A bare majority in these four\r\nsmall states may hinder the adoption of amendments; so that we may\r\nfairly and justly conclude that one-twentieth part of the American\r\npeople may prevent the removal of the most grievous inconveniences and\r\noppression, by refusing to accede to amendments.... Is this an easy mode\r\nof securing the public liberty? It is, sir, a most fearful situation,\r\nwhen the most contemptible minority can prevent the alteration of the\r\nmost oppressive government; for it may, in many respects, prove to be\r\nsuch.\"[36]\r\n\r\nThat such a small minority of the people should have the power under our\r\nconstitutional arrangements to prevent reform, can hardly be reconciled\r\nwith the general belief that in this country the majority rules. Yet\r\nsmall as was this minority when the Constitution was adopted, it is much\r\nsmaller now than it was then. In 1900 one forty-fourth of the population\r\ndistributed so as to constitute a majority in the twelve smallest states\r\ncould defeat any proposed amendment. As a matter of fact it is\r\nimpossible to secure amendments to the Constitution, unless the\r\nsentiment in favor of change amounts almost to a revolution. Only at\r\ncritical times in our history have constitutional amendments been\r\nadopted. During sixty-one years from 1804 to 1865, and since 1870, no\r\namendments have been made. The fifteen amendments were all adopted,\r\neither during the turbulent period of American politics which\r\nimmediately followed the ratification of the Constitution, or during\r\nthe reconstruction period after the Civil War. That it is not possible\r\nin ordinary times to change the Constitution is evident from the fact\r\nthat of some twenty-two hundred propositions for amendment only fifteen\r\nhave been adopted, and these during the periods above mentioned.[37]\r\n\r\n\"The argument in favor of these artificial majorities,\" says Professor\r\nBurgess, \"is that innovation is too strong an impulse in democratic\r\nstates, and must be regulated; that the organic law should be changed\r\nonly after patience, experience and deliberation shall have demonstrated\r\nthe necessity of the change; and that too great fixedness of the law is\r\nbetter than too great fluctuation. This is all true enough; but, on the\r\nother hand, it is equally true that development is as much a law of\r\nstate life as existence. Prohibit the former, and the latter is the\r\nexistence of the body after the spirit has departed. When, in a\r\ndemocratic political society, the well-matured, long and deliberately\r\nformed will of the undoubted majority can be persistently and\r\nsuccessfully thwarted, in the amendment of its organic law, by the will\r\nof the minority, there is just as much danger to the state from\r\nrevolution and violence as there is from the caprice of the majority,\r\nwhere the sovereignty of the bare majority is acknowledged. The\r\nsafeguards against too radical change must not be exaggerated to the\r\npoint of dethroning the real sovereign.\"[38]\r\n\r\nWhat Professor Burgess seems to overlook is the fact that the framers of\r\nthe Constitution deliberately intended to dethrone the numerical\r\nmajority. The restrictions which they placed upon the exercise of the\r\namending power were not only not inconsistent with the form of\r\ngovernment which they established, but as a matter of fact absolutely\r\nnecessary to ensure its preservation, since without such a limitation of\r\nthe power to amend, the majority could easily overcome all other checks\r\nupon its authority.\r\n\r\nThis feature of the Constitution, which nominally provides for\r\namendment, but really makes it an impossibility, is perhaps the best\r\nproof we could have that the Constitution as framed and adopted\r\nrepresented the views of a minority who intended by this means to\r\nperpetuate their influence. But, we are told, this can not be the case\r\nsince the states were free to accept or reject it. Let us not forget,\r\nhowever, that at no stage of the proceedings was the matter referred\r\ndirectly to the people. Bryce says: \"Had the decision been left to what\r\nis now called 'the voice of the people,' that is, to the mass of the\r\ncitizens all over the country, voting at the polls, the voice of the\r\npeople would probably have pronounced against the Constitution.\"[39]\r\nMoreover, \"the Convention met,\" as he observes, \"at the most fortunate\r\nmoment in American History [for securing the adoption of such a\r\nconstitution].... Had it been attempted four years earlier or four years\r\nlater at both of which times the waves of democracy were running high,\r\nit must have failed.\"[40] But even under these favoring conditions it\r\nwas no easy task to get the states to adopt it. The advocates of the\r\nConstitution employed every argument and influence that could contribute\r\nto the desired result. They appealed with telling effect to the dread of\r\nEuropean aggression. This induced many who had little sympathy with the\r\nproposed plan of government, to acquiesce in its adoption, believing\r\nthat some sort of a strong government was necessary for purposes of\r\ndefence. It was also boldly charged that money was employed to overcome\r\nopposition where other means of persuasion failed.[41]\r\n\r\nOur natural inclination is to disbelieve anything that reflects on the\r\npolitical methods employed by the founders of our government.\r\nNevertheless, the widespread belief that the politicians and public men\r\nof that time were less corrupt than those of to-day is, as Professor\r\nMcMaster says, a pure delusion. \"A very little study of long-forgotten\r\npolitics will suffice to show that in filibustering and gerrymandering,\r\nin stealing governorships and legislatures, in using force at the polls,\r\nin colonizing and in distributing patronage to whom patronage is due, in\r\nall the frauds and tricks that go to make up the worst form of practical\r\npolitics, the men who founded our state and national governments were\r\nalways our equals, and often our masters.\"[42] Of one thing we may be\r\nreasonably certain--the Constitution as adopted did not represent the\r\npolitical views of a majority of the American people--probably not even\r\na majority of those entitled to vote. Universal suffrage, we must\r\nremember, did not then exist, and both property and religious\r\nqualifications limited the right to hold public office. This of itself\r\nis evidence that those who then controlled politics did not believe in\r\nthe right of the majority to rule. And when we take account of the\r\nfurther fact that this was a time of political reaction, when the\r\ngovernment of the country was largely in the hands of those who despised\r\nor feared democracy, we can easily see that the natural effects of a\r\nrestricted suffrage may have been intensified by those methods of\r\n\"practical politics\" which not infrequently defeat the will of the\r\nmajority even to-day under universal suffrage. That it was the intention\r\nof the framers of the Constitution to bring about, if possible, the\r\nadoption of a form of government of which the majority of the people did\r\nnot approve, is clearly established by the record of their proceedings.\r\nHamilton, referring to the plan of government which he had proposed,\r\nsaid: \"I confess that this plan, and that from Virginia [the one\r\nsubmitted by Randolph and of which the Constitution as finally adopted\r\nwas a modification], are very remote from the idea of the people.\r\nPerhaps the Jersey plan is nearest their expectation. But the people are\r\ngradually ripening in their opinions of government--they begin to be\r\ntired of an excess of democracy....\"[43]\r\n\r\n\"The Federal government was not by intention a democratic government. In\r\nplan and structure it had been meant to check the sweep and power of\r\npopular majorities. The Senate, it was believed, would be a stronghold\r\nof conservatism, if not of aristocracy and wealth. The President, it was\r\nexpected, would be the choice of representative men acting in the\r\nelectoral college, and not of the people. The Federal judiciary was\r\nlooked to, with its virtually permanent membership, to hold the entire\r\nstructure of national politics in nice balance against all disturbing\r\ninfluences, whether of popular impulse or of official overbearance. Only\r\nin the House of Representatives were the people to be accorded an\r\nimmediate audience and a direct means of making their will effective in\r\naffairs. The government had, in fact, been originated and organized upon\r\nthe initiative and primarily in the interest of the mercantile and\r\nwealthy classes. Originally conceived as an effort to accommodate\r\ncommercial disputes between the States, it had been urged to adoption by\r\na minority, under the concerted and aggressive leadership of able men\r\nrepresenting a ruling class. The Federalists not only had on their side\r\nthe power of convincing argument, but also the pressure of a strong and\r\nintelligent class, possessed of unity and informed by a conscious\r\nsolidarity of material interests.\"[44]\r\n\r\nThe Constitution would certainly have been rejected, notwithstanding the\r\ninfluences that were arrayed in favor of its adoption, but for the\r\nbelief that it would shortly be amended so as to remove some of its more\r\nobjectionable features. In the large and influential states of\r\nMassachusetts, New York, and Virginia it was ratified by very small\r\nmajorities,[45] though each of these states accompanied its acceptance\r\nof the Constitution with various recommendations for amendment. As a\r\nresult of these suggestions from the states ratifying it, the first\r\nCongress in 1789 framed and submitted the first ten amendments. The\r\neleventh amendment was the outgrowth of the Supreme Court decision in\r\nthe case of Chisholm v. The State of Georgia. In this case the court\r\nheld, contrary to the interpretation given to the Constitution by\r\nHamilton when defending it in _The Federalist_,[46] that a private\r\nplaintiff could sue a state in the Federal Court. This decision aroused\r\na storm of indignation, and Congress in 1794 proposed the Eleventh\r\nAmendment, which counteracted the effect of this decision. The Twelfth\r\nAmendment, proposed by Congress in 1803, merely changed the method of\r\nelecting the President to meet the requirements of the party system\r\nwhich had then come into existence.\r\n\r\nThese first twelve amendments were all adopted during the infancy of the\r\nConstitution, and while it was still regarded as an experiment. But\r\nthough they had the effect of quieting public opinion and allaying the\r\nfears of the people concerning the new form of government, they made no\r\nimportant changes in the Constitution, leaving all its main features as\r\noriginally adopted. The same may be said of the last three amendments,\r\nwhich were the result of the Civil War. They were proposed and ratified,\r\nas Bryce says, \"under conditions altogether abnormal, some of the lately\r\nconquered states ratifying while actually controlled by the Northern\r\narmies, others as the price which they were obliged to pay for the\r\nreadmission to Congress of their senators and representatives.\"[47]\r\nThese amendments were really carried through, not by the free choice of\r\nthree-fourths of the states, as the Constitution requires, \"but under\r\nthe pressure of a majority which had triumphed in a great war,\"[48] and\r\nused military and political coercion to accomplish what otherwise could\r\nnot have been brought about. Nothing could have been farther from the\r\nintention of the victorious Northern states at that time than any\r\nimportant change in the form or character of the government which they\r\nhad waged a gigantic civil war to defend and enforce. Slavery, it is\r\ntrue, was abolished to remove forever the bone of contention between the\r\nNorth and the South. But the Constitution survived the Civil War,\r\nunchanged in all its essential features, and more firmly established\r\nthan ever.\r\n\r\nThat the plan of government originally established has undergone no\r\nimportant modification by constitutional amendment can not be ascribed\r\nto the fact that important changes have not been suggested. With the\r\ngrowth of more liberal views concerning government many attempts have\r\nbeen made to remove the constitutional barriers erected by our\r\nforefathers to stay the progress of democracy. Among the political\r\nreforms contemplated by this numerous class of proposed amendments may\r\nbe mentioned a shorter term for United States senators and election by\r\npopular vote; direct election of the President and the abolition of his\r\nveto power; a shorter term for Federal judges and their removal by the\r\nPresident on the joint address of both houses of Congress. The aim of\r\nall these proposed amendments has been the same, viz., to make the\r\nConstitution accord better with the democratic spirit of the time. It is\r\ninteresting to observe, however, that with the single exception of the\r\nproposed election of United States senators by popular vote, not one of\r\nthese had the support of either house of Congress, much less the\r\ntwo-thirds majority in both, or a majority in the legislatures of\r\ntwo-thirds of the states, as required to authorize their submission for\r\nratification or rejection. Even this measure, which has passed the House\r\nof Representatives several times by an overwhelming vote, has been\r\nentirely ignored by the Senate.\r\n\r\nNo proposal, then, to make any important change in the Constitution has\r\never obtained the preliminary two-thirds majority, to say nothing of\r\nthe majority in three-fourths of the states, necessary for its adoption.\r\n\r\nThat the majority required to propose an amendment is almost prohibitive\r\nof change, is shown by the record of popular elections and the journals\r\nof representative bodies. From the presidential election year of 1828,\r\nthe first for which we have a record of the popular vote, down to 1900,\r\nthe largest majority ever received by any candidate for the Presidency\r\nwas that of Andrew Jackson in 1828, when he had less than 56 per cent.\r\nof the popular vote.[49] Nine elections since Jackson's time resulted in\r\nthe choice of a President by less than a popular majority. No candidate\r\nin any presidential election from 1876 to 1900 inclusive has carried\r\ntwo-thirds of the states.[50]\r\n\r\nIt is still more difficult for any important reform measure to secure a\r\ntwo-thirds majority in a representative assembly, as the proceedings of\r\nCongress and our state legislatures abundantly prove. This is true for\r\nthe reason that a wealthy minority can exert an influence over such\r\nbodies out of all proportion to its numerical strength at the polls.\r\nHence even a bare majority can seldom be obtained for any measure which\r\ninterferes with or restricts the privileges of organized wealth. A\r\ntwo-thirds majority under such circumstances is practically impossible.\r\nAnd when we remember that any proposed amendment to the Constitution\r\nmust twice run the gauntlet of representative assemblies, receiving\r\nfirst a two-thirds majority in both houses of Congress and later a\r\nmajority in both houses of the legislature or in conventions in\r\nthree-fourths of the states, we readily see that this provision\r\neffectually precludes the possibility of any important amendment.\r\n\r\nOne of the principal objections to the Articles of Confederation--that\r\nthey lacked a practical amending power--applies, then, with no less\r\nforce to the Constitution itself. In one respect the Constitution is\r\neven more rigid than were the Articles of Confederation, since the\r\nCongress of the Confederation was the court of last resort for passing\r\non the constitutionality of its own legislation. This gave to Congress\r\nunder the Confederation at least a limited power of virtually amending\r\nthe Articles of Confederation by the ordinary process of law-making--a\r\npower possessed by the legislature in all countries where the system of\r\nchecks and balances is not recognized. Under the Constitution, however,\r\nthis power to amend the fundamental law can be exercised only to a very\r\nlimited extent by Congress, since the interpretation of the Constitution\r\nby that body for the purposes of law-making is subject to revision at\r\nthe hands of the Federal Judiciary. The Constitution, then, more\r\neffectually prevents changes desired by the majority than did the\r\nArticles of Confederation, since the former guards against the\r\npossibility of amendment under the guise of ordinary legislation while\r\nthe latter did not.\r\n\r\nAnother distinction must be borne in mind. The Articles of Confederation\r\nmade amendment difficult in order to prevent the general government from\r\nencroaching on the rights of the several states. It was not so much a\r\ndisposition to make change impossible, or even difficult, as, by keeping\r\nthe general government within established bounds, to leave the several\r\nstates free to regulate their own affairs and change their institutions\r\nfrom time to time to suit themselves.\r\n\r\nThis view finds support in the character of the early state\r\nconstitutions. These were shaped by the same revolutionary movement\r\nwhich produced the Declaration of Independence, and were largely\r\ninfluenced in their practical working by the \"self-evident\" truths\r\nproclaimed in the latter. One of the axioms of political science\r\nembodied in the Declaration of Independence was the right of the people\r\nto alter or abolish the existing form of government. This principle,\r\nhowever, was expressly recognized in but few of the earlier state\r\nconstitutions, which, as a rule, contained no provision for future\r\namendment. But such provision was not really necessary, inasmuch as the\r\npower of the legislature was limited only by its responsibility to the\r\nelectorate. A mere majority of the qualified voters might demand and\r\nsecure the enactment of laws which would virtually amend the\r\nconstitution. From this time on, however, we see a strong tendency to\r\nspecify in the constitution itself the manner in which it could be\r\nchanged; and by the time that the framers of the Federal Constitution\r\nmet in Philadelphia in 1787 a majority of the state constitutions\r\ncontained provisions of this kind.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Maryland constitution of 1776 it was necessary that an\r\namendment should \"pass the General Assembly, and be published at least\r\nthree months before a new election\" and confirmed by the General\r\nAssembly in the first session after such election.[51] The South\r\nCarolina constitution of 1778 permitted \"a majority of the members of\r\nthe senate and house of representatives\" to adopt amendments after\r\nhaving given ninety days' notice of such intention. The constitution of\r\nDelaware, 1776, required that constitutional amendments should be\r\nassented to by five-sevenths of the lower house and seven-ninths of the\r\nupper. This check on amendment was largely inoperative, however, for the\r\nreason above mentioned, viz., that the legislature was supreme, and\r\ncould enact by majority vote such laws as it saw fit, whether they were\r\nin harmony with the constitution or not.\r\n\r\nFive other state constitutions made provision for the adoption of\r\namendments by conventions. The Pennsylvania constitution of 1776\r\nprovided for the election every seventh year by the freemen of the state\r\nof a \"Council of Censors\" to hold office during one year from the date\r\nof their election. This body had the power \"to pass public censures, to\r\norder impeachments, and to recommend to the legislature the repealing\r\nsuch laws as appear to them to have been enacted contrary to the\r\nprinciples of the constitution.\" They also had power to call a\r\nconvention for amending the constitution. \"But ... the amendments\r\nproposed ... shall be promulgated at least six months before the day\r\nappointed for the election of such convention, for the previous\r\nconsideration of the people, that they may have an opportunity of\r\ninstructing their delegates on the subject.\" This provision of the\r\nPennsylvania constitution of 1776 was copied in the Vermont constitution\r\nof 1777. The constitution of Georgia, 1777, contained the following: \"No\r\nalteration shall be made in this constitution without petitions from a\r\nmajority of the counties, and the petition from each county to be signed\r\nby a majority of the voters in each county within this state; at which\r\ntime the assembly shall order a convention to be called for that\r\npurpose, specifying the alterations to be made, according to the\r\npetitions preferred to the assembly by the majority of the counties as\r\naforesaid.\" The Massachusetts constitution of 1780 provided that the\r\nquestion of amendment should be submitted to the qualified voters of the\r\nstate, and if two-thirds of those voting favored amendment, it was the\r\nduty of the legislature to order the election of delegates to meet in\r\nconvention for that purpose. The New Hampshire constitution of 1784\r\ncontained a similar provision.\r\n\r\nWe see, then, that several of the early state constitutions expressly\r\ngave, either directly to a majority of the qualified voters, or to their\r\nrepresentatives, the right to amend; and even in Massachusetts, New\r\nHampshire, and Delaware, whose constitutions expressly limited the power\r\nof the majority, the limitation was not effective, since the majority\r\ncould push through under the guise of ordinary legislation, measures\r\nwhich virtually amounted to an exercise of the amending power. Such\r\nlimitations on the power of the majority did not become effective until\r\na judiciary not directly responsible to the people, acquired the right\r\nto declare acts of the legislature null and void.\r\n\r\nAn examination of these features of the various state constitutions in\r\nforce in 1787 shows clearly the reactionary character of the Federal\r\nConstitution. It repudiated entirely the doctrine then expressly\r\nrecognized in some of the states and virtually in all, that a majority\r\nof the qualified voters could amend the fundamental law. And not only\r\ndid it go farther than any state constitution in expressly limiting the\r\npower of the majority, but it provided what no state constitution had\r\ndone--the means by which its limitations on the power of the majority\r\ncould be enforced.\r\n\r\nA comparison of this feature of our Constitution with the method of\r\namendment in other countries is interesting and instructive. In England\r\nno distinction is made between constitutional amendments and other\r\nlegislation. And since the Crown has lost the veto power and the House\r\nof Commons established its right to override the opposition of the House\r\nof Lords, the most radical changes may be made without even the checks\r\nwhich impede ordinary legislation in the United States.\r\n\r\nIn France amendment of the Constitution is almost as easy as in England,\r\nthough a distinction is made between this and ordinary legislation. When\r\nboth the Senate and Chamber of Deputies decide by an absolute majority\r\nin each that amendment is necessary, they meet in joint session as a\r\nNational Assembly for that purpose. An absolute majority of the members\r\ncomposing the National Assembly is required to change the Constitution.\r\n\r\nAmendments to the Federal Constitution of Australia may be proposed by\r\nan absolute majority of both Houses of Parliament. Not less than two nor\r\nmore than six months after the proposed amendment has been passed by\r\nboth houses, it must be submitted to the qualified voters in each\r\nstate. But if either house by an absolute majority passes a proposed\r\namendment which is rejected by the other house, and passes it again by\r\nan absolute majority after an interval of three months, the\r\nGovernor-General may submit the proposed amendment to the qualified\r\nvoters. A proposed amendment is adopted if it is approved by a majority\r\nof all those voting and also by a majority in a majority of the states.\r\n\r\nIn Switzerland the question whether the Federal Constitution ought to be\r\namended must be submitted to a popular vote whenever demanded by either\r\nhouse of the Federal Assembly or by fifty thousand voters (about\r\none-fifteenth of the voting population). A proposed amendment is adopted\r\nif it receives a majority of all the votes cast and at the same time a\r\nmajority in a majority of the Cantons, a provision copied, as we have\r\nseen, in the Federal Constitution of Australia.\r\n\r\nThese constitutions show the general tendency at the present time to\r\nmake the majority supreme. In the countries which have been most\r\ninfluenced by democratic ideas constitutional barriers against change\r\nhave largely or wholly disappeared. A constitution is in no proper sense\r\nthe embodiment of the will of the people unless it recognizes the right\r\nof the majority to amend. Checks which prevent legal and political\r\nreadjustment are a survival from monarchy and aristocracy and are not\r\nfound in any full-fledged democracy. Constitutions which are really\r\ndemocratic contain only such checks upon the people, if indeed they can\r\nbe called checks, as are calculated to insure the deliberate expression\r\nof the popular will. Constitutional provisions designed to obstruct\r\namendment are not only an anomaly in popular government, but they are in\r\nthe very nature of the case inoperative. This follows from the fact that\r\nthe law-making body, whether it be the people themselves or a\r\nrepresentative assembly, is the final interpreter of the constitution\r\nand may enact laws which virtually amend it. To make such provisions\r\nreally effective the constitution must vest the power to prevent\r\nlegislation in some branch of government not directly responsible to the\r\npeople. Usually this is a King or hereditary class. Our Constitution,\r\nhowever, provides a substitute for these in its general system of checks\r\nand especially in the independence of our national judiciary, which in\r\naddition to the exercise of ordinary judicial functions is also\r\npractically a branch of the legislature. The constitutional status of\r\nthe judiciary will be discussed in the following chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERAL JUDICIARY\r\n\r\n\r\nNo part of our Constitution has received less adverse criticism than\r\nthat which relates to the powers and tenure of the judiciary.\r\nConstitutional writers have almost without exception given it their\r\nunqualified approval, claiming that its wisdom is established beyond\r\nquestion by the political experience of the English-speaking race. To\r\nexpress a doubt as to the soundness of this view is to take issue with\r\nwhat appears to be the settled and mature judgment of the American\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the authority of the courts is \"the most vital part of our\r\ngovernment, the part on which the whole system hinges.\"[52] This is true\r\nfor the reason that the Federal judiciary is not only the most important\r\nof our constitutional checks on the people, but is also the means of\r\npreserving and enforcing all the other checks. To enable the Federal\r\njudges to exercise these important and far-reaching powers, it was\r\nnecessary to make them independent by giving them a life tenure. This\r\nprovision was in perfect harmony with the general plan and purpose of\r\nthe Constitution, a document framed, as we have seen, with a view to\r\nplacing effectual checks on the power of the majority. As a means to the\r\nend which the framers of the Constitution had in view, the independence\r\nof the judiciary was an admirable arrangement.\r\n\r\nHamilton says: \"Upon the whole, there can be no room to doubt that the\r\nConvention acted wisely in copying from the models of those\r\nconstitutions which have established _good behavior_ as the tenure of\r\ntheir judicial offices, in point of duration; and that so far from being\r\nblamable on this account, their plan would have been inexcusably\r\ndefective, if it had wanted this important feature of good government.\r\nThe experience of Great Britain affords an illustrious comment on the\r\nexcellence of the institution.\"[53]\r\n\r\nThis is quoted with approval by Story in his Commentaries on the\r\nConstitution and this same line of argument has been followed by legal\r\nand political writers generally. But with all due respect for the\r\neminent authorities who have placed so much stress on the political\r\nexperience of other countries, we may venture to ask if the parallel\r\nwhich they have assumed really exists. Is the use made of this argument\r\nfrom analogy warranted by the facts in the case? Are we sure that the\r\npolitical experience of England proves the wisdom of an independent\r\njudiciary? This can best be answered by referring to the circumstances\r\nwhich gave rise to the doctrine that the judges should be independent.\r\n\r\nIn England formerly the Crown appointed the judges and could remove\r\nthem. This power of appointment and removal placed the courts under the\r\ncontrol of the King and made it possible for him to use them as a means\r\nof oppressing the people. A striking example of the way in which this\r\npower could be abused was seen in the career of the notorious Jeffreys,\r\nthe pliant judicial tool of the cruel and tyrannical James II. To guard\r\nagainst a repetition of this experience it was urged that the judges be\r\nmade independent of the King.\r\n\r\nThis was done in 1701 by the Act of Settlement which provided that\r\njudges should be removed only on an address from Parliament to the\r\nCrown. This deprived the King of the power to remove judges on his own\r\ninitiative and virtually gave it to Parliament. The object of this\r\nprovision was to place a check in the interest of the people upon the\r\narbitrary power of the Crown. It made the judges independent of the\r\nKing, but at the same time established their responsibility to\r\nParliament by giving the latter the right to demand their removal.[54]\r\n\r\nThe statement so often made and so generally believed that the American\r\njudicial system was modeled after that of Great Britain will not bear\r\ninvestigation. English judges are not and never have been independent in\r\nthe sense in which that word is used with reference to the Federal\r\njudiciary of the United States. In making the judges independent of the\r\nKing, Parliament had no intention of leaving them free to exercise\r\nirresponsible powers. To have made them really independent would have\r\nbeen to create a new political power of essentially the same character\r\nand no less dangerous than the power of the King which they were seeking\r\nto circumscribe.\r\n\r\n\"In England,\" says Jefferson, \"where judges were named and removable at\r\nthe will of an hereditary executive, from which branch most misrule was\r\nfeared, and has flowed, it was a great point gained, by fixing them for\r\nlife, to make them independent of that executive. But in a government\r\nfounded on the public will, this principle operates in an opposite\r\ndirection, and against that will. There, too, they were still removable\r\non a concurrence of the executive and legislative branches. But we have\r\nmade them independent of the nation itself.\"[55]\r\n\r\nThere is, as a matter of fact, nothing in the political experience of\r\nGreat Britain to support the belief in an independent judiciary. The\r\njudges there do not constitute a co-ordinate branch of the government\r\nand can not enforce their opinion in opposition to that of Parliament.\r\nInstead of being independent, they are strictly dependent upon\r\nParliament whose supreme power and authority they are compelled to\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nThis being the case, it is hardly necessary to observe that the courts\r\nin England do not exercise legislative functions. The power to decide\r\nupon the wisdom or expediency of legislation is vested exclusively in\r\nParliament. The courts can not disregard a statute on the ground that it\r\nis in conflict with the Constitution, but must enforce whatever\r\nParliament declares to be the law. As the judiciary under the English\r\nsystem has no voice in the general policy of the state, the tenure of\r\njudges during good behavior carries with it no power to thwart the\r\npopular will.\r\n\r\nThe provision in the Constitution of the United States for the life\r\ntenure of a non-elective judiciary serves, however, an altogether\r\ndifferent purpose. It was designed as a check, not upon an irresponsible\r\nexecutive as was the case in England, but upon the people themselves.\r\nIts aim was not to increase, but to diminish popular control over the\r\ngovernment. Hence, though professing to follow the English model, the\r\nframers of the Constitution as a matter of fact rejected it. They not\r\nonly gave the Federal judges a life tenure, but made that tenure\r\nunqualified and absolute, the power which Parliament had to demand the\r\nremoval of judges being carefully witheld from the American Congress.\r\nThis reversed the relation which existed between the legislative and\r\njudicial branches of government under the English system and raised the\r\njudiciary from a dependent and subordinate position to one that made it\r\nin many respects supreme. The most important attribute of sovereignty,\r\nthat of interpreting the Constitution for the purposes of law-making,\r\nwhich belonged to Parliament as a matter of course, was withheld from\r\nCongress and conferred upon the Federal judiciary. Not only, then, did\r\nthe framers of the Constitution depart from the English model in making\r\nthe Federal judiciary independent of Congress, but they went much\r\nfarther than this and conferred upon the body whose independence and\r\nirresponsibility were thus secured, powers which under the English\r\nsystem were regarded as the exclusive prerogative of a responsible\r\nParliament. This made our Supreme judges, though indirectly appointed,\r\nholding office for life and therefore independent of the people, the\r\nfinal interpreters of the Constitution, with power to enforce their\r\ninterpretation by declaring legislation null and void. A more powerful\r\ncheck upon democratic innovation it would be hard to devise.\r\n\r\nThe main reason for making the Federal judges independent and\r\npolitically irresponsible has not been generally recognized. Thus, in a\r\nrecent work Professor Channing, while expressing some disapproval of\r\nthis feature of our system, fails to offer a satisfactory explanation of\r\nits origin. \"Perhaps nothing in the Constitution of the United States is\r\nmore extraordinary,\" he tells us, \"than the failure of that instrument\r\nto provide any means for getting rid of the judges of the Federal courts\r\nexcept by the process of impeachment. In England, in Massachusetts and\r\nin Pennsylvania, judges could be removed by the executive upon address\r\nby both branches of the legislative body.[56] In none of these cases was\r\nit necessary to allege or to prove any criminal act on the part of the\r\njudge. In colonial days the tenure of the judicial office had been of\r\nthe weakest. In the royal provinces, the judges had been appointed by\r\nthe Crown and had been removable at pleasure. In the charter colonies,\r\nthe judges had been appointed by the legislature, and their tenure of\r\noffice was generally for one year. The precariousness of the judicial\r\noffice in the royal provinces had more than once led to attempts on the\r\npart of the colonists to secure greater permanency, because a permanent\r\njudiciary would afford them protection against the royal authorities.\r\nAll attempts of this kind, however, had been defeated by the negative\r\nvoice of the government of England. Possibly the permanence of judicial\r\ntenure which is found in the Constitution of the United States may be\r\nregarded in some sort as the result of this pre-revolutionary\r\ncontest.\"[57]\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, however, there is nothing extraordinary or\r\ndifficult to explain in this permanency of judicial tenure which the\r\nConstitution established. It was not in the charter colonies where\r\nannual legislative appointment of judges was the rule, but in the royal\r\nprovinces that efforts were made by the people to secure greater\r\npermanency of judicial tenure. They wished to give the judges more\r\nindependence in the latter, because it would be the means of placing a\r\ncheck upon irresponsible authority, but were satisfied with a short term\r\nof office for judges in the colonies where they were elected and\r\ncontrolled by the legislature. Any explanation of the permanent tenure\r\nof our Federal judges \"as the result of this pre-revolutionary contest\"\r\nis insufficient. It was clearly a device consciously adopted by the\r\nframers of the Constitution, not for the purpose of limiting\r\nirresponsible authority, but for the purpose of setting up an authority\r\nthat would be in large measure politically irresponsible.\r\n\r\nConservative writers while giving unstinted praise to this feature of\r\nthe Constitution have not explained its real significance. They have\r\nassumed, and expect us to take it for granted, that the Federal\r\njudiciary was designed as a means of making the will of the people\r\nsupreme; that its independence and exalted prerogatives were necessary\r\nto enable it to protect the people against usurpation and oppression at\r\nthe hands of the legislative branch of the government.\r\n\r\nHamilton tells us, \"The standard of good behavior for the continuance in\r\noffice of the judicial magistracy, is certainly one of the most valuable\r\nof the modern improvements in the practice of government. In a monarchy,\r\nit is an excellent barrier to the despotism of the prince; in a\r\nrepublic, it is a no less excellent barrier to the encroachments and\r\noppressions of the representative body....\r\n\r\n\"The complete independence of the courts of justice is peculiarly\r\nessential in a limited constitution. By a limited constitution, I\r\nunderstand one which contains certain specified exceptions to the\r\nlegislative authority.... Limitations of this kind can be preserved in\r\npractice no other way than through the medium of the courts of justice,\r\nwhose duty it must be to declare all acts contrary to the manifest tenor\r\nof the Constitution void....[58]\r\n\r\n\"Some perplexity respecting the rights of the courts to pronounce\r\nlegislative acts void, because contrary to the Constitution, has arisen\r\nfrom an imagination that the doctrine would imply a superiority of the\r\njudiciary to the legislative power. It is urged that the authority which\r\ncan declare the acts of another void, must necessarily be superior to\r\nthe one whose acts may be declared void....\r\n\r\n\"There is no position which depends on clearer principles, than that\r\nevery act of a delegated authority, contrary to the tenor of the\r\ncommission under which it is exercised, is void. No legislative act,\r\ntherefore, contrary to the Constitution, can be valid. To deny this\r\nwould be to affirm that the deputy is greater than his principal; that\r\nthe servant is above his master; that the representatives of the people\r\nare superior to the people themselves; that men, acting by virtue of\r\npowers, may do not only what their powers do not authorize, but what\r\nthey forbid.\r\n\r\n\"If it be said that the legislative body are themselves the\r\nconstitutional judges of their own powers, and that the construction\r\nthey put upon them is conclusive upon the other departments, it may be\r\nanswered, that this can not be the natural presumption, where it is not\r\nto be collected from any particular provisions in the Constitution. It\r\nis not otherwise to be supposed that the Constitution could intend to\r\nenable the representatives of the people to substitute their _will_ to\r\nthat of their constituents. It is far more rational to suppose that the\r\ncourts were designed to be an intermediate body between the people and\r\nthe legislature, in order, among other things, to keep the latter within\r\nthe limits assigned to their authority. The interpretation of the laws\r\nis the proper and peculiar province of the courts. A constitution is, in\r\nfact, and must be, regarded by the judges as a fundamental law. It\r\ntherefore belongs to them to ascertain its meaning, as well as the\r\nmeaning of any particular act proceeding from the legislative body. If\r\nthere should happen to be an irreconcilable variance between the two,\r\nthat which has the superior obligation and validity ought, of course, to\r\nbe preferred; in other words, the Constitution ought to be preferred to\r\nthe statute, the intention of the people to the intention of their\r\nagents....\r\n\r\n\"This independence of the judges is equally requisite to guard the\r\nConstitution and the rights of individuals from the effects of those ill\r\nhumours which the arts of designing men, or the influence of particular\r\nconjunctures, sometimes disseminate among the people themselves, and\r\nwhich, though they speedily give place to better information, and more\r\ndeliberate reflection, have a tendency, in the mean time, to occasion\r\ndangerous innovations in the government, and serious oppressions of the\r\nminor party in the community.\"[59]\r\n\r\nThis argument for an independent judiciary, which has been adopted by\r\nall writers who have attempted to defend the system, may be summarized\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\nThe Constitution being the solemn and deliberate expression of the will\r\nof the people, is the supreme law of the land. As such it enumerates the\r\npowers of the several branches of the government and sets limits to\r\ntheir authority. Any act, therefore, on the part of the agents or\r\nrepresentatives of the people, which exceeds the authority thus\r\ndelegated, is in violation of the fundamental law and can not bind those\r\nwhom they profess to represent.\r\n\r\nThese checks upon the agents and representatives of the people can not\r\nbe enforced, however, if each branch of the government is to be\r\npermitted to determine for itself what powers the Constitution has\r\nconferred upon it. Under such a system Congress would overstep the\r\nlimits which have been placed upon its authority and substitute its own\r\nwill for the will of the people. To prevent this the framers of the\r\nConstitution placed the courts, in their scheme of government, between\r\nthe people and the legislature and gave them power to determine and\r\nenforce the constitutional limitations on the authority of Congress.\r\nThis put the Constitution and the rights and liberties of the people\r\nunder the protection of their natural guardian, the Federal judiciary,\r\nand thereby secured the people against the danger of legislative\r\ntyranny.\r\n\r\nWe must not forget the circumstances under which Hamilton wrote this\r\ndefence of the Federal judiciary. Although the Constitutional Convention\r\nhad spared no pains to prevent the publication of its proceedings, the\r\nfeeling was more or less general that the whole movement was a\r\nconspiracy against popular government.\r\n\r\n\"The charge of a conspiracy against the liberties of the people,\" said\r\nHamilton, \"which has been indiscriminately brought against the advocates\r\nof the plan [the Constitution], has something in it too wanton and too\r\nmalignant not to excite the indignation of every man who feels in his\r\nown bosom a refutation of the calumny. The perpetual changes which have\r\nbeen rung upon the wealthy, the well-born, and the great, have been such\r\nas to inspire the disgust of all sensible men. And the unwarrantable\r\nconcealments and misrepresentations which have been in various ways\r\npracticed to keep the truth from the public eye have been of a nature to\r\ndemand the reprobation of all honest men.\"[60]\r\n\r\nThe evidence now accessible to students of the American Constitution\r\nproves that the charges of \"concealments and misrepresentations\" made\r\nwith this show of righteous indignation against the opponents of the\r\nConstitution might have justly been made against Hamilton himself. But\r\nknowing that the views expressed in the Federal Convention were not\r\npublic property, he could safely give to the press this \"refutation of\r\nthe calumny.\"\r\n\r\nThe publication of the debates on the Constitution at that time would\r\nhave shown that the apprehensions of the people were not entirely\r\nwithout justification. The advocates of the new form of government did\r\nnot propose to defeat their own plans by declaring their real\r\npurpose--by explaining the Constitution to the people as they themselves\r\nunderstood it. For it was not to be supposed that the people would\r\npermit the adoption of a form of government the avowed object of which\r\nwas to limit their power. Therefore the conservatives who framed the\r\nConstitution and urged its ratification posed as the friends of\r\ndemocracy. Professing to act in the name of, and as the representatives\r\nof the people, they urged them to accept the Constitution as a means of\r\nrestraining their agents and representatives and thereby making their\r\nown will supreme. It was not the aim of these articles, written, as they\r\nwere, to influence public opinion, to explain the real purpose of the\r\nConstitution, but rather to disguise its true character.\r\n\r\nIn this species of political sophistry Hamilton was a master. It is, to\r\nsay the least, strange that the misstatement of historical facts, false\r\nanalogies and juggling of popular catch-words which constitute his\r\ndefence of the Federal judiciary should have been so often referred to\r\nas an example of faultless logic and a complete vindication of the\r\nsystem. Hamilton's interpretation of the Constitution as contained in\r\nthese articles was merely for popular consumption, and not a frank and\r\nunequivocal expression of what he himself really believed. He was an\r\nuncompromising opponent of democracy and considered the English\r\ngovernment of that day, with its hereditary monarchy and aristocracy,\r\nthe best form of government ever devised.[61]\r\n\r\nHe favored therefore as near an approach to the English system as the\r\ncircumstances of the case would permit. According to the plan which he\r\nsubmitted to the Convention the executive branch of the government was\r\nto be placed beyond the reach of public opinion by a method of\r\nappointment designed to guard against the choice of a popular favorite\r\nand by life tenure. Not only did he wish to make the President\r\nindependent of the people, but he proposed to give him an absolute veto\r\non all acts of Congress. Moreover, the President was to appoint the\r\ngovernors of the various states, and these, like the royal governors\r\nbefore the Revolution, were to have an absolute veto on the acts of the\r\nstate legislatures.[62] This would have made the President a monarch in\r\nall but name, and though independent of the people, have given him\r\npower to thwart legislation which no majority in Congress, however\r\ngreat, could override.\r\n\r\nBut this did not go far enough in the direction of providing checks on\r\npopular legislation to suit Hamilton. The members of the upper house of\r\nCongress were, like the President, to be indirectly elected and to hold\r\noffice for life. And finally over and above Congress was to be placed a\r\nSupreme Court whose members, by their mode of appointment and life\r\ntenure, were to be independent of the people. This body, which was to be\r\nthe final interpreter of the Constitution, was designed as an additional\r\nsafeguard against democratic legislation. The lower house of Congress\r\nwas the only branch of the government in which any provision was made,\r\nunder Hamilton's plan, for the representation of public opinion. Through\r\nthe House of Representatives the people were to have an opportunity to\r\npropose legislation, but no power to enact it, or to control the general\r\npolicy of the government.\r\n\r\nThe refusal of the Convention to endorse the scheme of government\r\nproposed by Hamilton must not be understood as implying lack of sympathy\r\nwith the political views which it embodied. With his main purpose, that\r\nof effectually curbing the power of the majority, nearly all the members\r\nof that body were in full accord. They were, however, shrewd\r\nexperienced men of affairs who understood the temper of the people and\r\nknew that their plan of political reorganization could be carried\r\nthrough only by disguising its reactionary character and representing it\r\nas a democratic movement. To have submitted the Constitution in the form\r\nin which it was proposed by Hamilton would have defeated their purpose.\r\nIt was too obviously undemocratic, inasmuch as it provided for a strong\r\ncentralized government only one branch of which was to be elected by the\r\npeople, while the other three were to be placed beyond the reach of\r\npublic opinion through indirect election and life tenure. The\r\nConstitution as framed and submitted was more democratic in appearance,\r\nthough it really contained all that was essential in Hamilton's plan.\r\nLife tenure for the President and Senate was discarded, it is true, but\r\nindirect election was expected to ensure their independence. The\r\nabsolute veto on Federal and state legislation which Hamilton proposed\r\nto give to a permanent executive was the most serious practical\r\nobjection to his scheme, since it showed too clearly the purpose of the\r\nConvention to make the aristocratic element supreme not only in the\r\ngeneral government but in the states as well. In form and appearance the\r\nConstitution merely gave the President a qualified negative on the acts\r\nof Congress; but in reality the Convention went much farther than this\r\nand conferred the absolute veto on federal and state legislation\r\ncontended for by Hamilton. The power was merely transferred from the\r\nPresident in whose hands he had proposed to place it, and given to the\r\nSupreme Court. The end which he had in view was thus attained without\r\narousing the opposition which would have been inevitable had there been\r\nanything in the Constitution to indicate that such a power was intended\r\nto be conferred.\r\n\r\nThese facts disclose the true motive for Hamilton's untiring efforts in\r\nbehalf of the Constitution. He desired its adoption, not because he\r\nbelieved that it would make the will of the people supreme, as his above\r\nquoted references to _principal_ and _agent_ and _master_ and _servant_\r\nwould seem to imply, but for the opposite reason that it would make the\r\ngovernment largely independent of public opinion. As a matter of fact,\r\nHamilton had no use whatever for a political system which assumed that\r\nthe people were a _master_ or _principal_ and the government merely\r\ntheir _servant_ or _agent_. The chief merit of the Constitution from his\r\npoint of view was not its acceptance, but its repudiation of this\r\nprinciple. Had it been framed on the theory that the will of the people\r\nis the supreme law of the land, no one would have been more bitterly\r\nopposed to its adoption than Hamilton himself. That he gave it his\r\nunqualified support is the best evidence that he did not believe that it\r\nwould make the will of the people supreme.\r\n\r\nNo intelligent man who carefully reads Hamilton's argument in defence of\r\nthe Federal judiciary could be misled as to his real views. His dread of\r\ndemocracy is clearly seen in his desire to exalt the Supreme Court and\r\nsubordinate Congress, the only branch of the government in which the\r\npeople were directly represented. His seeming anxiety lest the\r\nlegislative body should disregard the will of the people was a mere\r\ndemagogic attempt to conceal his real motive. Had this been what he\r\nreally feared, the obvious remedy would have been the complete\r\nresponsibility of Congress to the people. In fact, this was necessarily\r\nimplied in the doctrine of principal and agent which he professed to\r\naccept, but which found no recognition either in the constitution which\r\nhe himself had suggested, or in the one finally adopted. To this theory\r\nof government the system which he defended was in reality diametrically\r\nopposed. Under the guise of protecting the people against\r\nmisrepresentation at the hands of Congress, it effectually limited the\r\npower of the people themselves by tying the hands of their responsible\r\nagents. It deprived the people of the power to compel the enactment of\r\nlaw by making the consent of the Supreme Court necessary to the\r\nenforcement of all legislation, federal and state. This was a\r\nsubstantial compliance with Hamilton's proposal to give an absolute veto\r\nto an independent and permanent executive. It was a matter of but\r\nlittle consequence whether this power was conferred on a single person,\r\nas the President, or on a body, as the Supreme Court, provided the\r\nmanner of appointment and tenure of those in whose hands it was placed,\r\nwere such as to ensure an independent exercise of the power thus\r\nconferred. The result would be the same in either case: the law-making\r\npower would be placed beyond the reach of popular control.\r\n\r\nTo allow the legislative body to be \"the constitutional judges of their\r\nown power,\" Hamilton tells us, would be to affirm \"that the servant is\r\nabove his master.\" Hence it is necessary, he argues, to divest Congress\r\nof all authority to determine the extent of its own powers. To\r\naccomplish this the Supreme Court was made the constitutional judge of\r\nthe powers of Congress and of its own powers as well. Hamilton's\r\nargument involves the assumption that, while it is dangerous to allow a\r\nfrequently elected and responsible branch of the government to determine\r\nthe extent of its own powers, it is at the same time eminently wise and\r\nproper to give, not only this power, but also the power to determine the\r\nauthority of all other branches of government, to a permanent body whom\r\nthe people neither elect nor control. His constant reference to the\r\ndanger of legislative oppression was merely a mask for his hatred of\r\npopular government. He was anxious to curb the power of Congress because\r\nhe feared that public opinion would too largely influence the\r\nproceedings of that body. On the other hand, he saw no danger of\r\nexecutive or judicial tyranny since these branches of the government\r\nwere expected to be independent of public opinion. Hamilton's purpose\r\nwas to limit the power of the people by subordinating that part of the\r\ngovernment in which they were directly represented and strengthening\r\nthose parts over which they had no direct control. His defence of the\r\nConstitution is thus really an argument against responsible government\r\nand a defence of the principles underlying monarchy and aristocracy.\r\n\r\nAs the English judiciary is really an offshoot from the executive, the\r\npower of the court to declare legislation null and void may be regarded\r\nas merely a phase of the executive veto. No evidence of this can be\r\nfound, it is true, in the constitutional history of England during the\r\neighteenth and nineteenth centuries. But if we go back to the period\r\npreceding the revolution of 1688, it seems to be clearly established\r\nthat the English courts claimed, and in a few instances exercised, the\r\npower to annul acts of Parliament. As late as 1686, in the case of\r\nGodden v. Hales, \"the Court of King's Bench actually held that important\r\nprovisions of the statute of 25 Charles II, cap. 2, were void because\r\nconflicting with the King's rightful prerogative.\"[63] When we remember\r\nthat the courts were then under the control of the King, it is not\r\nsurprising that they should have attempted to exercise this power in\r\ndefence of the royal prerogative. But with the Revolution of 1688, which\r\nestablished the supremacy of Parliament, the last trace of the judicial\r\nnegative disappeared. From that time on the right of Parliament to be\r\nthe constitutional judge of its own powers has not been seriously\r\nquestioned. Even the veto power of the King soon became obsolete, though\r\nin theory it for a time survived.\r\n\r\nSuch was the constitutional status of the English judiciary when the\r\nAmerican colonies asserted their independence. The new state\r\nconstitutions adopted at the outbreak of the war, as has been shown in a\r\nprevious chapter, represented the more democratic thought of the period\r\nand were really revolutionary in character. They abolished the veto\r\npower of the governor and failed to abolish the judicial negative only\r\nbecause it did not then exist.[64] This was followed after the\r\nRevolution by a conservative reaction which was not, however, a popular\r\nmovement. It received no general support or sympathy from the masses of\r\nthe people, but was planned and carried through by those whom we may\r\ndescribe as the ruling class, and who were, for the most part, strongly\r\nin sympathy with English political institutions. It was characterized by\r\nreal, if not avowed, hostility to the new political ideas embodied in\r\nthe Declaration of Independence and in the Revolutionary state\r\nconstitutions. Its aim was to reform the state governments by restoring,\r\nas far as possible, the checks on democracy which the Revolutionary\r\nmovement had swept away.\r\n\r\nThe judiciary was the only branch of the state government in which the\r\nprinciple of life tenure had been retained, and therefore the only one\r\nwhich could be depended on to offer any effectual resistance to public\r\nopinion. Evidently, then, the easiest and most practicable method of\r\naccomplishing the end which the conservative classes had in view was to\r\nenlarge the powers of the judiciary. Accordingly an effort was made at\r\nthis time in several of the states to revive and develop the judicial\r\nveto. A practical argument in favor of this check was doubtless the fact\r\nthat it required no formal changes in the state constitutions, and, for\r\nthis reason, was less likely to arouse formidable opposition than any\r\navowed attempt to restore the system of checks.\r\n\r\nWhen the Constitutional Convention met in 1787 the courts in five states\r\nwere beginning to claim the power to declare acts of the legislature\r\nunconstitutional. In a Virginia case as early as 1782 the judges of the\r\ncourt of appeals expressed the opinion \"that the court had power to\r\ndeclare any resolution or act of the legislature, or of either branch of\r\nit, to be unconstitutional and void.\"[65] The court, however, did not\r\nexercise the power to which it laid claim. It merely declared a\r\nresolution of the House of Delegates invalid on the ground that it had\r\nbeen rejected by the Senate. This case is important only as showing that\r\nthe court was then paving the way for the exercise of the power to annul\r\nacts of the legislature.\r\n\r\nThe case of Trevett v. Weeden, decided by the Superior Court of\r\nJudicature of Rhode Island in September, 1786, is said to be the first\r\nin which a law was declared null and void on the ground that it was\r\nunconstitutional.[66] The court in this case did not expressly say that\r\nthe law in question was unconstitutional and therefore void, but it\r\nrefused to recognize its validity. The power which the court exercised\r\nto ignore a legislative act was promptly repudiated by the law-making\r\nbody, and at the expiration of their term of office a few months later,\r\nthe judges responsible for this decision were replaced by others. In\r\n1786 or 1787 a case was decided in Massachusetts, and also one in New\r\nJersey, in which it is claimed that the court declared a legislative act\r\nnull and void.\r\n\r\nThe first reported case in which an act of a legislature was held to be\r\ncontrary to a _written_ constitution is that of Bayard v. Singleton,\r\ndecided by the Superior Court of North Carolina in May, 1787. James\r\nIredell, afterward a member of the North Carolina convention, held to\r\nratify the Constitution, and a judge of the United States Supreme Court,\r\nand William R. Davie, one of the framers of the Constitution, were\r\nattorneys for the plaintiff, the party in whose interest the law was\r\ndeclared unconstitutional. This decision received much adverse criticism\r\nat the time. The judges \"were fiercely denounced as usurpers of power.\r\nSpaight, afterwards governor, voiced a common notion when he declared\r\nthat 'the state was subject to the three individuals, who united in\r\ntheir own persons the legislative and judicial power, which no monarch\r\nin England enjoys, which would be more despotic than the Roman\r\ntriumvirate and equally insufferable.'\"[67]\r\n\r\nIredell, in a letter to Spaight written August 26, 1787, defended the\r\ndecision as a means of limiting the power of the majority. \"I conceive\r\nthe remedy of a new election,\" he says, \"to be of very little\r\nconsequence, because this would only secure the views of a\r\nmajority....\"[68] Iredell expressed what was no doubt the real purpose\r\nof the judicial veto--the limitation of the power of the majority.\r\n\r\nIn eight of the thirteen states the doctrine that the judiciary could\r\nrefuse to enforce laws regularly enacted by the legislative body had not\r\neven been asserted by the courts themselves, much less recognized and\r\naccepted by the people generally. There is no evidence to warrant the\r\nbelief that this power was anywhere claimed or exercised in response to\r\na popular demand or that it had at this time become a firmly established\r\nor generally recognized feature of any state government.\r\n\r\nThis being the case, there is no ground for the contention that the\r\npower to annul acts of the legislature was necessarily implied in the\r\ngeneral grant of judicial authority contained in the Constitution.\r\nMoreover, it was not expressly conferred, for the Constitution as\r\nsubmitted and ratified contains no reference to this power.\r\n\r\n\"There is no provision in the Constitution of the United States ...\r\nwhich clothes the judiciary with the power to declare an act of the\r\nlegislature generally null and void on account of its conceived\r\nrepugnance to the Constitution or on any other account.\"[69]\r\n\r\nIt has been claimed that in this respect our general government is even\r\nless democratic than the framers of the Constitution intended. This\r\nview, however, is not borne out by the facts. The assertion of this\r\nfar-reaching power by our national judiciary, though not expressly\r\nauthorized by the Constitution, was nevertheless in harmony with the\r\ngeneral spirit and intention of its framers. That the members of the\r\nConstitutional Convention declined to confer this power in unequivocal\r\nlanguage does not justify the inference that they did not wish and\r\nintend that it should be exercised by the courts.\r\n\r\nGouverneur Morris, who claims to have written the Constitution with his\r\nown hand, tells us that in framing that part of it relating to the\r\njudiciary, \"it became necessary to select phrases,\" which, expressing\r\nhis own views, \"would not alarm others.\"[70] There was, it is true, some\r\nobjection in the Convention to the doctrine that the Supreme Court\r\nshould have authority to decide upon the constitutionality of\r\nCongressional legislation. Mercer and Dickinson believed that this power\r\nshould not be exercised by the judiciary.[71] But it was contended on\r\nthe other hand by Wilson, Luther Martin, Gerry, Mason, and Madison that\r\nthis power could be exercised without any provision expressly conferring\r\nit.[72]\r\n\r\nIn view of the fact that it was maintained by leading members of the\r\nConvention that this power could and should be exercised by the Federal\r\njudiciary, it is but reasonable to suppose that a majority of that body\r\nwished to confer it; for had this not been the case, the Constitution as\r\nsubmitted would have contained a provision expressly withholding it. But\r\nhowever much the Convention may have desired to give to the judiciary\r\nthe power to veto legislation, it could not have been done by an express\r\nprovision of the Constitution. Any such attempt would have disclosed\r\naltogether too clearly the undemocratic reactionary character of the\r\nproposed government and thus have prevented its adoption. This end was\r\nattained indirectly through the general system of checks which the\r\nConstitution imposed upon the other branches of the government and upon\r\nthe people, since it made it possible for the judiciary to assume and\r\nexercise this power.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing to indicate that the people generally appreciated the\r\nsignificance of this feature of the Constitution at the time of its\r\nratification. Outside of the Constitutional Convention the judicial\r\nnegative appears to have been seldom mentioned. Hamilton, the most\r\ncourageous and outspoken opponent of popular government, claimed, it is\r\ntrue, that it would be the duty of the Federal courts \"to declare all\r\nacts contrary to the manifest tenor of the Constitution void.\"[73] In a\r\nfew of the state conventions held to ratify the Constitution the power\r\nwas referred to. Oliver Ellsworth in the Connecticut convention,[74]\r\nJames Wilson in the Pennsylvania convention,[75] and John Marshall in\r\nthe Virginia convention,[76] expressed the opinion that the Constitution\r\ngave the Supreme Court the power to declare acts of Congress null and\r\nvoid.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason for believing, however, that this was the generally\r\naccepted notion at that time. For even Marshall himself a few years\r\nlater, as attorney in the case of Ware v. Hylton, which involved the\r\nvalidity of an act of the legislature of Virginia, appears to have\r\ndefended the opposite view before the United States Supreme Court. In\r\nthat case he said:\r\n\r\n\"The legislative authority of any country can only be restrained by its\r\nown municipal constitution: this is a principle that springs from the\r\nvery nature of society; and the judicial authority can have no right to\r\nquestion the validity of a law, unless such a jurisdiction is expressly\r\ngiven by the Constitution.\"[77] The mere fact that he presented this\r\nargument shows that the view which he afterwards held as Chief Justice\r\nof the United States Supreme Court was not then generally accepted. His\r\ncontention on this occasion that the judiciary can not annul an act of\r\nthe legislature unless the power be expressly conferred may have been at\r\nvariance with the opinion which he really held, but it certainly was\r\nnot opposed to what he regarded as the generally accepted view;\r\notherwise, his argument would have been based on an admittedly false\r\ntheory of judicial powers. The conclusion is irresistible that at this\r\ntime the right of the judiciary to declare a legislative act null and\r\nvoid was not generally recognized. The framers of the Constitution\r\nclearly understood that this power was not implied in the sense that it\r\nwas then a recognized function of the judiciary, or one necessarily\r\ncontained in the Constitution as they interpreted it to the people to\r\nsecure its adoption. It was by controlling the Executive and the Senate,\r\nand through these the appointment of Supreme judges, that they expected\r\nto incorporate this power in the Constitution and make it a permanent\r\nfeature of our political system.[78]\r\n\r\nThis purpose is evident in the appointments to the Supreme bench made\r\nduring the twelve years of Federalist rule that followed the adoption of\r\nthe Constitution. Of the thirteen chief and associate Justices appointed\r\nduring this period, five had been members of the Constitutional\r\nConvention.[79] Eleven had been members of the various state\r\nconventions held to ratify the Constitution.[80] Three, as shown by the\r\nrecords of the federal and state conventions, had unequivocally\r\nexpressed themselves in favor of the exercise of this power by the\r\nSupreme Court,[81] while another, James Iredell, had taken an active\r\npart in securing the first reported decision in which an act of a state\r\nlegislature was declared null and void by a court on the ground that it\r\nwas contrary to a written constitution.[82] Only one in this entire list\r\nhad not taken part directly in framing or adopting the Constitution by\r\nserving as a delegate to the federal, or a state convention, or\r\nboth.[83] All had been ardent supporters of the Constitution and were in\r\nfull sympathy with its main purpose.\r\n\r\nIt is true that Washington in the winter of 1795-6 offered the Chief\r\nJusticeship of the United States Supreme Court to Patrick Henry, who had\r\nbeen the ablest and most conspicuous opponent of the Constitution in the\r\nVirginia convention. Henry had, however, as Presidential elector voted\r\nfor Washington for President in 1789 and had in the meantime become\r\nreconciled to the Constitution. Moreover, while he had been opposed to\r\nmany features of the Constitution, he was from the first in full\r\nsympathy with the judicial veto. He thought the Constitution was\r\ndefective in that it contained no assurance that such a power would be\r\nexercised by the courts. In his argument against the ratification of the\r\nConstitution in the Virginia convention he said:\r\n\r\n\"The honorable gentleman did our judiciary honor in saying that they had\r\nfirmness to counteract the legislature in some cases. Yes, sir, our\r\njudges opposed the acts of the legislature. We have this landmark to\r\nguide us. They had fortitude to declare that they were the judiciary,\r\nand would oppose unconstitutional acts. Are you sure that your Federal\r\njudiciary will act thus? Is that judiciary as well constructed, and as\r\nindependent of the other branches, as our state judiciary? Where are\r\nyour landmarks in this government? I will be bold to say that you can\r\nnot find any in it. I take it as the highest encomium on this country,\r\nthat the acts of the legislature, if unconstitutional, are liable to be\r\nopposed by the judiciary.\"[84]\r\n\r\nThe fact that only those who were in sympathy with the Constitution were\r\nrecognized in these appointments becomes the more significant when we\r\nremember that several of the leading states ratified it by very slender\r\nmajorities. In New York, Massachusetts, and Virginia the supporters of\r\nthe Constitution barely carried the day; yet they alone were recognized\r\nin the five appointments to the Supreme bench from these states made\r\nduring the period above mentioned. The opponents of the Constitution\r\nrepresented, moreover, not only in these states, but in the country at\r\nlarge, a majority of the people. Nevertheless, true to the purpose of\r\nthose who founded our Federal government, the popular majority was\r\nentirely ignored and the Supreme Court so constituted as to make it\r\nrepresent the minority. Through these appointments the Federalists\r\nsecured an interpretation of the Constitution in harmony with their\r\npolitical theories and thereby established the supremacy of the\r\njudiciary in our scheme of government. The subsequent success of the\r\nSupreme Court in asserting and enforcing its right to annul acts of\r\nCongress completed the establishment in this country of a form of\r\ngovernment which Professor Burgess correctly describes as an\r\n\"aristocracy of the robe.\"[85]\r\n\r\nThe full significance of this annulling power is not generally\r\nunderstood. The Supreme Court claims the right to exercise it only as\r\nthe guardian of the Constitution. It must be observed, however, that\r\nwhile professing to be controlled by the Constitution, the Supreme Court\r\ndoes, as a matter of fact, control it, since the exclusive right to\r\ninterpret necessarily involves the power to change its substance. This\r\nvirtually gives to the aristocratic branch of our government the power\r\nto amend the Constitution, though this power is, as we have seen,\r\npractically denied to the people.\r\n\r\nWe have become so accustomed to the exercise of this power by the courts\r\nthat we are in the habit of regarding it as a natural and necessary\r\nfunction of the judiciary. That this is an erroneous view of the matter\r\nis shown by the fact that this power \"is scarcely dreamed of anywhere\r\nelse.\"[86] In other countries the power is unknown whether the\r\nConstitution be unwritten as in England or written as in France,\r\nGermany, and Switzerland. Nor does it make any difference whether the\r\ngovernment be national in character as in England and France, or federal\r\nas in Germany, Switzerland, and Australia. In no other important country\r\nare the courts allowed to veto the acts of the legislative body. The\r\nexercise of this power can be justified here only on the ground that it\r\nis indispensable as a means of preserving and perpetuating the\r\nundemocratic character of the Constitution.\r\n\r\n\"This power [the Supreme Court] has the last word in the numberless\r\nquestions which come under its jurisdiction. The sovereign people after\r\na time conquers the other powers, but this Supreme Court almost always\r\nremains beyond its reach. For more than twenty or even thirty years,\r\ntwice the _grande mortalis aevi spatium_, it may misuse its authority\r\nwith impunity, may practically invalidate a law voted by all the other\r\npowers, or a policy unanimously accepted by public opinion. It may\r\nnullify a regular diplomatic treaty[87] ... by refusing to enforce it by\r\njudicial sanction, or may lay hands on matters belonging to the\r\nsovereignty of the states and federalize them without one's being able\r\nto make any effective opposition, for this Court itself determines its\r\nown jurisdiction as against the state tribunals. It is one of\r\nBlackstone's maxims that in every constitution a power exists which\r\ncontrols without being controlled, and whose decisions are supreme. This\r\npower is represented in the United States by a small oligarchy of nine\r\nirremovable judges. I do not know of any more striking political paradox\r\nthan this supremacy of a non-elected power in a democracy reputed to be\r\nof the extreme type. It is a power which is only renewed from generation\r\nto generation in the midst of a peculiarly unstable and constantly\r\nchanging state of things--a power which in strictness could, by virtue\r\nof an authority now out of date, perpetuate the prejudices of a past\r\nage, and actually defy the changed spirit of the nation even in\r\npolitical matters.\"[88]\r\n\r\nIt is a fundamental principle of free government that all legislative\r\npower should be under the direct control of the people. To make this\r\ncontrol effective all laws must be enacted by the people themselves, or\r\nthey must at least have what practically amounts to the power of\r\nappointing and removing their representatives. Democracy implies not\r\nmerely the right of the people to defeat such laws as they do not want,\r\nbut the power to compel such legislation as they need. The former power\r\nthey possess in any country in which they control one coordinate branch\r\nof the legislature, even though the government be a monarchy or\r\naristocracy. This negative power of defeating adverse legislation is\r\nmerely the first step in the evolution of free government, and is\r\npossessed by the people in all countries which have made much\r\nconstitutional progress. There is a vast difference, however, between a\r\nsystem under which the people constitute a mere check upon the\r\ngovernment and one which gives them an active control over legislation.\r\nIt is the difference between a limited monarchy or aristocracy on the\r\none hand and a government by the people themselves on the other.[89]\r\n\r\nIf this test be applied to the government of the United States we see\r\nthat it lacks the essential feature of a democracy, inasmuch as laws can\r\nnot be enacted without the consent of a body over which the people have\r\npractically no control. In one respect at least the American system is\r\neven less democratic than was the English government of the eighteenth\r\ncentury. The House of Commons was a coordinate branch of the legislature\r\nand as such had a recognized right to interpret the Constitution. No\r\npolitical program, no theory of state functions, could receive\r\nlegislative sanction without its approval. The House of Commons could\r\nenforce its interpretation of the Constitution negatively since it had\r\nan absolute veto on all legislation. On the other hand its own views and\r\npolicies could become law only in so far as they were acquiesced in by\r\nthe other branches of the law-making authority. Under this system the\r\naccepted interpretation of the Constitution was a compromise, one to\r\nwhich each branch of the legislature assented. Each of these coordinate\r\nbranches of the government was equally the guardian and protector of the\r\nConstitution, since it had the right to interpret, and the power to\r\nenforce its interpretation, of the legislative authority of the other\r\nbranches by an absolute veto on their interpretation of their own\r\npowers.\r\n\r\nThis authority to act as final interpreter of the Constitution which\r\nunder the English system was distributed among King, Lords, and Commons,\r\nwas under the American scheme of government taken out of the hands of\r\nCongress and vested in the judiciary alone. There are certain matters of\r\nminor importance, however, concerning which the interpretation placed\r\nupon the Constitution by other branches of the government is final. But\r\nin interpreting the Constitution for the purpose of legislating, the\r\nfinal authority is in the hands of the Federal Supreme Court. It is the\r\nexclusive possession of this most important prerogative of a sovereign\r\nlegislative body which makes our Supreme Court the most august and\r\npowerful tribunal in the world. Through the sole right to exercise this\r\npower our Federal judiciary has become in reality the controlling branch\r\nof our government. For while it has an absolute veto on the acts of\r\nCongress, its own exercise of the highest of all legislative\r\nauthority--that of interpreting the Constitution and the laws of the\r\nland--is unlimited and uncontrolled. It is not surprising, then, that\r\nthe Constitution as it exists to-day is largely the work of the Supreme\r\nCourt. It has been molded and developed by, and largely owes its spirit\r\nand character to the interpretation which that body has placed upon it.\r\n\r\nOur Supreme Court thus has what virtually amounts to the power to enact\r\nas well as the power to annul. Congress can legislate only with the\r\nconsent of the Federal judiciary; but the latter, through its control\r\nover the interpretation of the Constitution may in effect legislate\r\nwithout the consent of the other branches of the government, and even\r\nin opposition to them. Under the guise of an independent judiciary we\r\nhave in reality an independent legislature, or rather an independent\r\nlegislative and judicial body combined. This union of sovereign\r\nlegislative authority and ordinary judicial functions in the same\r\nindependent body is a significant and dangerous innovation in\r\ngovernment. It has not only deprived the people of the power to make the\r\ninterpretation of the Constitution and the trend of legislation conform\r\nto the public sentiment of the times; it has even taken from them all\r\neffectual power to prevent changes which they do not want, but which the\r\njudiciary in the exercise of its exclusive right to act as the guardian\r\nand interpreter of the Constitution may see fit to make. Under our\r\nsystem, then, the people do not have even the negative power of absolute\r\nveto which they possess wherever they control a coordinate branch of the\r\nlegislature.\r\n\r\nIn so far as the exercise of legislative power is controlled by the\r\nSupreme Court our government is essentially aristocratic in character.\r\nIt represents the aristocratic principle, however, in its least\r\nobtrusive form. But while avoiding the appearance, it provides the\r\nsubstance of aristocratic control.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see in the exaltation of the Federal judiciary a survival\r\nof the old mediaeval doctrine that the king can do no wrong. In fact,\r\nmuch the same attitude of mind which made monarchy possible may be seen\r\nin this country in our attitude toward the Supreme Court. As long as the\r\npeople reverenced the king his irresponsible power rested on a secure\r\nfoundation. To destroy the popular belief in his superior wisdom and\r\nvirtue was to destroy the basis of his authority. Hence all criticism of\r\nthe king or his policy was regarded as an attack on the system itself\r\nand treated accordingly as a serious political crime.\r\n\r\nThe old view was well expressed by James I of England in a speech made\r\nin the Star Chamber on June 20, 1601, in which he said:\r\n\r\n\"That which concerns the mystery of the King's power is not lawful to be\r\ndisputed; for that is to wade into the weakness of princes, and to take\r\naway the mystical reverence that belongs unto them that sit on the\r\nthrone of God.\"[90]\r\n\r\nWe see this same fact illustrated also in the history of the church, for\r\nabsolutism was not confined in the Middle Ages to the state alone. As\r\nthe King was the recognized guardian of the established political order\r\nand its final interpreter, so the ecclesiastical hierarchy claimed the\r\nright to guard the faith and expound the creed of the people. Criticism\r\nand dissent, political and religious, were rigorously repressed. The\r\npeople were required to accept the political and religious system\r\nimposed on them from above. Implicit faith in the superior wisdom of\r\ntheir temporal and spiritual rulers was made the greatest of all\r\nvirtues. But with the growth of an intelligent skepticism throughout the\r\nwestern world, the power of king and priest has been largely overthrown.\r\n\r\nYet even in this country something akin to the old system of political\r\ncontrol still survives in the ascendency of our Federal judiciary. The\r\nexclusive right claimed by this branch of the government to guard and\r\ninterpret the Constitution is the same prerogative originally claimed by\r\nthe king. The judiciary, too, is the branch of our government farthest\r\nremoved from the influence of public opinion and consequently the one in\r\nwhich the monarchical principle most largely survives.\r\n\r\nThe courts not only claim to be the final arbiters of all constitutional\r\nquestions, but have gone much farther than this and asserted their right\r\nto annul legislative acts not in conflict with any constitutional\r\nprovision. Story says: \"Whether, indeed, independently of the\r\nConstitution of the United States, the nature of republican and free\r\ngovernment does not necessarily impose some restraints upon the\r\nlegislative power has been much discussed. It seems to be the general\r\nopinion, fortified by a strong current of judicial opinion, that, since\r\nthe American Revolution, no state government can be presumed to possess\r\nthe transcendental sovereignty to take away vested rights of\r\nproperty.\"[91]\r\n\r\nThe judiciary has thus claimed not only the power to act as the final\r\ninterpreter of the Constitution, but also the right, independently of\r\nthe Constitution, to interpret the political system under which we live,\r\nand make all legislative acts conform to its interpretation of that\r\nsystem. According to this doctrine the courts are the final judges of\r\nwhat constitutes republican government and need not base their power to\r\nannul a legislative act on anything contained in the Constitution\r\nitself. If we accept this view of the matter, legislation must conform\r\nnot only to the Constitution as interpreted by the judiciary, but to the\r\npolitical and ethical views of the latter as well. The President and\r\nCongress derive their authority from the Constitution, but the judiciary\r\nclaims, as we have seen, a control over legislation not conferred by the\r\nConstitution itself. Yet, while laying claim to powers that would make\r\nit supreme, the judicial branch of our Federal government has, as a\r\nrule, been careful to avoid any open collision, or struggle for\r\nsupremacy, with the other branches of the government. It has retained\r\nthe sympathy and approval of the conservative classes by carefully\r\nguarding the rights of property and, by declining to interfere with the\r\npolitical discretion of Congress or the President, it has largely\r\nescaped the hostile criticism which any open and avowed attempt to\r\nthwart the plans of the dominant party would surely evoke. But in thus\r\nlimiting its own authority, the Supreme Court has attempted to make a\r\ndistinction between judicial and political powers which does not appear\r\nto have any very substantial basis. The essential marks of a judicial\r\npower, Judge Cooley tells us, are \"that it can be exercised only in a\r\nlitigated case; that its direct force is spent in determining the rights\r\nof the parties to that case; and that unless and until a case has arisen\r\nfor judicial determination, it can not be invoked at all.\"[92]\r\n\r\n\"The power given to the Supreme Court,\" he says, \"to construe the\r\nConstitution, to enforce its provisions, to preserve its limitations,\r\nand guard its prohibitions, is not _political_ power, but is judicial\r\npower alone because it is power exercisable by that court only in the\r\ndischarge of the judicial function of hearing and deciding causes in\r\ntheir nature cognizable by courts of law and equity.\"[93]\r\n\r\nIn the first place it is to be observed that judicial power as thus\r\ndefined is practically co-extensive with that of the legislature, since\r\nscarcely an exercise of legislative authority could be mentioned which\r\nwould not affect the rights of persons or of property and which could\r\nnot, therefore, be made the subject of a judicial controversy.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, it must be remembered that the Federal judiciary in\r\nassuming the exclusive right to interpret the Constitution has taken\r\ninto its keeping a power which, as we have seen, was not judicial in\r\ncharacter when the Constitution was adopted, and is not even now\r\nconsidered judicial in any other important country. In declaring a\r\nlegislative act null and void it is exercising a power which every\r\nsovereign law-making body possesses, the power to defeat any proposed\r\nlegislation by withholding its assent. The mere fact that our Supreme\r\nJudges and our legal writers generally have with practical unanimity\r\ncalled it a judicial power does not make it such. That it is in reality\r\na legislative and not a judicial power is amply confirmed by the uniform\r\nand time-honored practice of all other nations, even including England,\r\nwhose institutions until a century and a quarter ago were our own.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, no difficulty in understanding why those who framed\r\nthe Constitution and controlled its interpretation exhausted the arsenal\r\nof logic in trying to prove that it was a judicial power. This was\r\nmerely a part of their plan to make the Supreme Court practically a\r\nbranch of the Federal legislature and thereby secure an effective check\r\non public opinion. As the power could not be expressly given without\r\ndisclosing too clearly the purpose of the Convention, it was necessary\r\nthat it should be implied. And it could be held to be implied only by\r\nshowing that it was a natural, usual and, under the circumstances,\r\nproper power for the judiciary to exercise. Unless it could be\r\nestablished, then, that it was essentially a judicial function and not a\r\npolitical or legislative power, its assumption by the Supreme Court\r\ncould not be defended on any constitutional grounds. This explains the\r\npersistent and untiring efforts to convince the American people that the\r\npower to set aside an act of Congress is purely judicial--efforts which,\r\nthough supported by the weight of American authority, are far from\r\nconvincing.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court has, it is true, time and again expressly disclaimed\r\nall right to exercise legislative or political power; yet under the\r\npretext that the authority to annul legislation is purely judicial, it\r\nhas made use of a power that necessarily involves the exercise of\r\npolitical discretion. The statement, then, that it is the settled policy\r\nof this body not to interfere with the political powers of the other\r\ndepartments can not be taken literally, since under the accepted\r\ninterpretation of the Constitution it has the power to, and as a matter\r\nof fact does interfere, whenever it declares an act of Congress null and\r\nvoid.\r\n\r\nIt would be a mistake, then, to suppose that the Federal judiciary has\r\nsuffered any loss of influence through its voluntary relinquishment of\r\nthe veto power in the case of political questions. This self-imposed\r\nrestriction on its authority merely affords it a convenient means of\r\nplacing beyond its jurisdiction measures which it may neither wish to\r\napprove nor condemn. And since the court must decide what are and what\r\nare not political questions, it may enlarge or narrow the scope and\r\nmeaning of the word _political_ to suit its purposes. As a matter of\r\nfact, then, the power which it appears to have voluntarily surrendered,\r\nit still largely retains.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, the Supreme Court has been remarkably fortunate in\r\nescaping hostile criticism. Very rarely have its decisions and policy\r\nbeen attacked by any organized party. In the platform of the Republican\r\nparty of 1860 the strong pro-slavery attitude of the court was, it is\r\ntrue, severely denounced. But from that time until 1896 no party dared\r\nto raise its voice in criticism of the Federal judiciary. Both the\r\nDemocratic and the Populist platforms of the latter date, however,\r\ncondemned the Income Tax decision and government by injunction. The\r\nDemocratic platform also hinted at the possible reorganization of the\r\nSupreme Court--the means employed by the Republican party to secure a\r\nreversal of the Legal Tender decision of 1869.\r\n\r\nThis comparative freedom from criticism which the Supreme Court has\r\nenjoyed until recent years does not indicate that its decisions have\r\nalways been such as to command the respect and approval of all classes.\r\nIt has from the beginning had the full confidence of the wealthy and\r\nconservative, who have seen in it the means of protecting vested\r\ninterests against the assaults of democracy. That the Supreme Court has\r\nlargely justified their expectations is shown by the character of its\r\ndecisions.\r\n\r\nDuring the first one hundred years of its history two hundred and one\r\ncases were decided in which an act of Congress, a provision of a state\r\nconstitution or a state statute, was held to be repugnant to the\r\nConstitution or the laws of the United States, in whole or in part.\r\nTwenty of these involved the constitutionality of an act of Congress.\r\nOne hundred and eighty-one related to the Constitution or the statute of\r\na state. In fifty-seven instances the law in question was annulled by\r\nthe Supreme Court on the ground that it impaired the obligation of\r\ncontracts. In many other cases the judicial veto was interposed to\r\nprevent what the court considered an unconstitutional exercise of the\r\npower to regulate or tax the business or property of corporations.[94]\r\n\r\nThese decisions have been almost uniformly advantageous to the\r\ncapital-owning class in preserving property rights and corporate\r\nprivileges which the unhindered progress of democracy would have\r\nabridged or abolished. But we need not confine our attention to these\r\ncomparatively few instances in which laws have actually been declared\r\nnull and void. There is a much more numerous and more important class of\r\ncases in which the Supreme Court, while not claiming to exercise this\r\npower, has virtually annulled laws by giving them an interpretation\r\nwhich has defeated the purpose for which they were enacted. The\r\ndecisions affecting the powers of the Inter-State Commerce Commission\r\nmay be cited as an illustration. This body, created by Congress for the\r\npurpose of regulating the railway traffic of the country, has, as Mr.\r\nJustice Harlan observes,[95] \"been shorn by judicial interpretation, of\r\nauthority to do anything of an effective character.\" Both the general\r\nand the state governments in their efforts to grapple with this problem\r\nhave encountered the restraining arm of the Federal judiciary which has\r\nenlarged its jurisdiction until nearly every important case involving\r\ncorporate interests may be brought before the Federal court.\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, in the laws which have been annulled or modified by\r\ninterpretation that we find the chief protection afforded to capital,\r\nbut rather in the laws which have not been enacted. The mere existence\r\nof this power and the certainty that it would be used in defence of the\r\nexisting social order has well-nigh prevented all attacks on vested\r\nrights by making their failure a foregone conclusion.\r\n\r\nIt is but natural that the wealthy and influential classes who have been\r\nthe chief beneficiaries of this system should have used every means at\r\ntheir command to exalt the Supreme Court and thereby secure general\r\nacquiescence in its assumption and exercise of legislative authority. To\r\nthe influence of these classes in our political, business, and social\r\nlife must be attributed in large measure that widespread and profound\r\nrespect for the judicial branch of our government which has thus far\r\nalmost completely shielded it from public criticism.\r\n\r\nThere are many indications, however, that popular faith in the\r\ninfallibility of the Supreme Court has been much shaken in recent years.\r\nThis is not surprising when we consider the wavering policy of that body\r\nin some of the important cases that have come before it. Take, for\r\nexample, the _Legal Tender_ decisions. The court at first declared the\r\nlegal tender acts unconstitutional by a majority of five to three. Then\r\none of the justices who voted with the majority having resigned and\r\nCongress having created an additional judgeship, Justices Strong and\r\nBradley were appointed to fill these vacancies. The former, as a member\r\nof the Supreme Bench of the State of Pennsylvania, had rendered a\r\ndecision upholding the constitutionality of these acts, and the latter\r\nwas said to hold the same opinion. At any rate the first decision was\r\nreversed by a majority of five to four. The point at issue in these two\r\ndecisions was whether Congress had authority to enact measures of this\r\nkind in time of war. The matter coming up again, the Supreme Court\r\ndecided, and this time by a majority of eight to one, that Congress had\r\nthis power, not only during war, but in times of peace as well.[96]\r\n\r\nReference should also be made in this connection to the Income Tax\r\ndecisions of 1895. The first of these was a tie, four to four, Justice\r\nJackson being absent. Six weeks later the second decision was read\r\ndeclaring the Income Tax unconstitutional by a vote of five to four,\r\nJustice Shiras, who had voted on the first hearing to uphold the Income\r\nTax, now voting against it. This change in the attitude of a single\r\nmember of the court converted what would have been a majority for, into\r\na majority against the measure, overruled a line of decisions in which\r\nthe tax had been sustained and thereby effectually deprived Congress of\r\nthe power to impose a Federal Income Tax until such time as the court\r\nmay change its mind. Even more significant are the recent Insular cases\r\nin which the division of opinion and diversity of grounds for the\r\nconclusions reached are, to say the least, surprising.\r\n\r\nOne may well ask, after viewing these decisions, if constitutional\r\ninterpretation as practiced by the Supreme Court is really a science in\r\nthe pursuit of which the individual temperament, personal views and\r\npolitical sympathies of the Justices do not influence the result. Have\r\nwe gained enough under this system in the continuity and consistency of\r\nour legislative policy and its freedom from class or political bias to\r\ncompensate us for the loss of popular control? That these questions are\r\nlikely to receive serious consideration in the near future we can\r\nscarcely doubt, when we reflect that the Supreme Court has, by the\r\ncharacter of its own decisions, effectually exploded the doctrine of\r\njudicial infallibility, which constitutes the only basis upon which its\r\nmonopoly of constitutional interpretation can be defended.\r\n\r\nThe evident lack of sympathy with proposed reforms which has, upon the\r\nwhole, characterized the proceedings of the Federal courts is rather\r\nstrikingly illustrated in the address of Judge Taft on \"Recent\r\nCriticisms of the Federal Judiciary.\" He makes use of the following\r\nlanguage: \"While socialism, as such, has not obtained much of a foothold\r\nin this country, ... schemes which are necessarily socialistic in their\r\nnature are accepted planks in the platform of a large political party.\r\nThe underlying principle of such schemes is that it is the duty of the\r\ngovernment to equalize the inequalities which the rights of free\r\ncontract and private property have brought about, and by enormous outlay\r\nderived as far as possible from the rich to afford occupation and\r\nsustenance to the poor. However disguised such plans of social and\r\ngovernmental reform are, they find their support in the willingness of\r\ntheir advocates to transfer without any compensation from one who has\r\nacquired a large part of his acquisition to those who have been less\r\nprudent, energetic, and fortunate. This, of course, involves\r\nconfiscation and the destruction of the principle of private\r\nproperty.\"[97] This emphatic condemnation of proposed reforms which had\r\nthe full sympathy and approval of many thoughtful and conscientious\r\npeople furnishes the show of justification at least for the very\r\ncriticisms which it was intended to silence.\r\n\r\nWith the progress of democracy it must become more and more evident that\r\na system which places this far-reaching power in the hands of a body not\r\namenable to popular control, is a constant menace to liberty. It may not\r\nonly be made to serve the purpose of defeating reform, but may even\r\naccomplish the overthrow of popular rights which the Constitution\r\nexpressly guarantees. In proof of this statement we need but refer to\r\nthe recent history of our Federal judiciary. The Sixth Amendment to the\r\nConstitution guarantees the right of trial by jury in all criminal\r\nprosecutions; but it is a matter of common knowledge that this\r\ntime-honored safeguard against the tyranny and oppression of ruling\r\nclasses has been overthrown by the Federal courts. With the ascendency\r\nof corporate wealth and influence, government by injunction has become\r\nan important feature of our system. The use made of the injunction in\r\nrecent years in the conflicts between labor and capital has placed a\r\nlarge and important class of crimes beyond the pale of this\r\nconstitutional provision. Moreover, this particular class of crimes is\r\nthe one where denial of the right of trial by jury is most likely to\r\nresult in oppression. Under this mode of procedure the court has\r\nvirtually assumed the power to enact criminal legislation, and may\r\npunish as crimes acts which neither law nor public opinion condemns. It\r\nensures conviction in many cases where the constitutional right of trial\r\nby jury would mean acquittal. It places a powerful weapon in the hands\r\nof organized wealth which it is not slow to use.[98]\r\n\r\nThis so-called _government by injunction_ is merely an outgrowth of the\r\narbitrary power of judges to inflict punishment in cases of contempt. In\r\nthis respect, as well as in the power to veto legislation, the authority\r\nof our courts may be regarded as a survival from monarchy. The right of\r\njudges to punish in a summary manner those whom they may hold to be in\r\ncontempt of their authority has been defended by legal writers generally\r\non the ground that it is the only way in which the necessary respect for\r\njudicial authority can be maintained. It is difficult, however, to see\r\nwhy this argument would not apply with equal force to the executive and\r\nlegislative branches of the government; for there must be some means of\r\nenforcing obedience to every lawful authority, legislative, executive,\r\nor judicial. The progress toward responsible government has long since\r\ndeprived the executive of the power to inflict arbitrary punishment, and\r\nthe legislature, though still retaining in a limited degree the power to\r\nimprison for contempt of its authority, seldom uses and almost never\r\nabuses it. The question is not whether contempt of authority should be\r\npunished, but whether the officer whose authority has been disregarded\r\nshould also act as judge and jury, should ascertain the guilt and fix\r\nthe punishment of those whom he as complaining witness has accused of\r\ncontempt of his authority. This procedure is utterly at variance with\r\nthe idea of political responsibility, and survives only because the\r\njudicial branch of our government has thus far effectually resisted the\r\ninroads of democracy. That the exercise of this arbitrary and\r\nirresponsible power is necessary in a democratic community, to ensure\r\nproper respect for the courts, seems highly improbable. In fact, no\r\ncourse could be suggested which would be more likely in the end to bring\r\nthem into disrepute.[99]\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to observe that while the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates has not hesitated to veto an act of Congress, \"no treaty, or\r\nlegislation based on, or enacted to carry out, any treaty stipulations\r\nhas ever been declared void or unconstitutional by any court of\r\ncompetent jurisdiction; notwithstanding the fact that in many cases the\r\nmatters affected, both as to the treaty and the legislation, are\r\napparently beyond the domain of Congressional legislation, and in some\r\ninstances of Federal jurisdiction.\"[100]\r\n\r\nWhy has the Federal Supreme Court freely exercised the power to annul\r\nacts of Congress and at the same time refrained from exercising a like\r\ncontrol over treaties? The Constitution makes no distinction between\r\nlaws and treaties in this respect. It provides that \"the judicial power\r\nshall extend to all cases, in law and equity, arising under this\r\nConstitution, the laws of the United States, and the treaties made, or\r\nwhich shall be made, under their authority.\"[101] If this provision is\r\nto be interpreted as conferring on the Federal courts the power to\r\ndeclare acts of Congress null and void, it also confers the same power\r\nin relation to treaties. Moreover, the Supreme Court has claimed, and\r\nhas been conceded, the right to act as the guardian of the Constitution.\r\nThe authority thus assumed by the Federal judiciary can be justified, if\r\nat all, only on the theory that the Constitution limits all governmental\r\npowers, and that it is the duty of the Supreme Court to enforce the\r\nlimitations thus imposed by declaring null and void any unconstitutional\r\nexercise of governmental authority.\r\n\r\nNot only in the Constitution itself was no distinction made between laws\r\nand treaties in relation to the power of the judiciary, but the same is\r\ntrue of the Judiciary Act of September 24, 1789, which provided that\r\nwhere the highest court in a state in which a decision in the suit could\r\nbe had decides against the validity of \"a treaty or statute of, or an\r\nauthority exercised under, the United States,\" such judgment or decree\r\n\"may be re-examined, and reversed or affirmed in the Supreme Court [of\r\nthe United States] on a writ of error.\" The right of the Federal Supreme\r\nCourt to declare both laws and treaties null and void was thus clearly\r\nand unequivocally recognized in this act. The object here, however, was\r\nnot to establish judicial control over treaties, but to deprive the\r\nstate courts of all authority over them.\r\n\r\nThe failure of the Supreme Court to exercise the right to annul treaties\r\nis to be explained in part by the fact that the judicial veto was\r\nintended primarily as a check on democracy. From the point of view of\r\nthe conservatives who framed the Constitution it was a device for\r\nprotecting the classes which they represented against democratic\r\n\"excesses\" in both the state and Federal government. It was expected\r\nthat this tendency would be manifested mainly in the legislation of the\r\nvarious states and possibly in some slight degree in Congressional\r\nlegislation, since the President and Senate would occasionally find it\r\nexpedient to yield too largely to the demands of the directly elected\r\nHouse. But in the case of treaties made by the President and Senate,\r\nboth safely removed, as they thought, beyond the reach of popular\r\ninfluence, there was no obvious need of a conservative check. In\r\ndeveloping the policy of the Federal courts in pursuance of the purpose\r\nof those who framed the Constitution, it was perfectly natural that the\r\njudicial veto should not have been used to limit the treaty-making\r\npower.\r\n\r\nBut even if the Federal courts had felt inclined to extend their\r\nauthority in this direction, the Constitution did not as in the case of\r\nCongressional legislation confer upon them the means of self-protection.\r\nIn declaring null and void an act of Congress which did not have the\r\nsupport of at least two-thirds of the Senate, the Supreme Court is\r\nexercising a power which, if not expressly conferred upon it by the\r\nConstitution, it can at any rate exercise with impunity, since the\r\nmajority in the Senate which it thus overrides is not large enough to\r\nconvict in case of impeachment. All treaties must have the approval of\r\ntwo-thirds of the Senate; and since the majority in this body required\r\nto ratify a treaty is the same as that required to convict in\r\nimpeachment proceedings, it is readily seen that the Senate has the\r\nconstitutional power to prevent judicial annulment of treaties.\r\nTwo-thirds of the Senate could not overcome judicial opposition,\r\nhowever, unless supported by at least a majority in the House of\r\nRepresentatives. But inasmuch as the Supreme Court is pre-eminently the\r\nrepresentative of conservatism and vested interests, it is likely to\r\ndisapprove of the policy of the Senate only when that body yields to the\r\ndemands of the people. In all such cases the House would naturally\r\nsupport the Senate as against the Supreme Court. It is not surprising,\r\nthen, that the Federal courts have not attempted to limit the\r\ntreaty-making power.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the subject of the Federal courts one feature of the\r\njudicial negative deserves further notice. The fact that it is not\r\nexercised until a case involving the law in question is brought before\r\nthe court in the ordinary course of litigation is often referred to by\r\nconstitutional writers as one of its chief merits. And yet until a\r\ncompetent court has actually declared a legislative act null and void,\r\nit is for all practical purposes the law of the land and must be\r\nrecognized as such. It may vitally affect industry and commerce and\r\nrequire an elaborate readjustment of business relations. It may even be\r\nyears after such an act is passed before a decision is obtained from the\r\ncourt of last resort. And if the decision annuls the law, it does so not\r\nfrom the time that the judgment of the court is rendered, but from the\r\ntime the act in question was originally passed. This retroactive\r\ncharacter of the judicial veto is strongly suggestive of the _ex post\r\nfacto_ legislation which the Constitution expressly forbids. By thus\r\ninvalidating the law from the beginning it may leave a vast body of\r\nbusiness contracts without legal protection or support. As a\r\nconsequence, it is impossible for any one, be he ever so well informed,\r\nto know just what legislative acts are valid and what are not. The\r\namount of uncertainty which this introduces into business relations is\r\nmore easily imagined than described.\r\n\r\nAmerica can claim the rather questionable distinction of being the only\r\nimportant country in which we find this uncertainty as to the law, since\r\nit is the only one in which the courts have a negative on the acts of\r\nthe legislature. That we have ourselves realized the disadvantages of\r\nthe system is shown by the changes made in the constitutions of several\r\nstates with a view of diminishing the frequency of the judicial veto.\r\nThese provisions make it the duty of the judges of the supreme court of\r\nthe state to give their opinion upon questions of law when required by\r\nthe governor or other branch of the law-making authority.[102]\r\n\r\nIn so far as constitutional provisions of this sort have been intended\r\nto prevent the evils resulting from a deferred exercise of the judicial\r\nveto, they have largely failed to accomplish their purpose. This has\r\nbeen due to the attitude of the courts, which have held that an opinion\r\nthus given in compliance with a constitutional requirement is not\r\nbinding upon them when the question is raised again in the ordinary way\r\nin the trial of a case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE CHECKS AND BALANCES OF THE CONSTITUTION\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo features of this system, the difficulty of amendment and the\r\nextraordinary powers of the judiciary have been discussed at some\r\nlength. Both, as we have seen, were designed to limit the power of the\r\npopular majority. This purpose is no less evident when we view the\r\nConstitution as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Federal Convention had little sympathy with the\r\ndemocratic trend of the Revolutionary movement. It was rapidly carrying\r\nthe country, they thought, to anarchy and ruin. To guard against this\r\nimpending evil was the purpose of the Constitution which they framed. It\r\nwas their aim to eliminate what they conceived to be the new and false\r\nand bring the government back to old and established principles which\r\nthe Revolutionary movement had for the time being discredited. They\r\nbelieved in the theory of checks and balances in so far as the system\r\nimplied the limitation of the right of popular control, and made the\r\nConstitution to this extent as complete an embodiment of the theory as\r\nthe circumstances of the time permitted.\r\n\r\nIn any evolutionary classification of governments the American system\r\noccupies an intermediate position between the old type of absolute\r\nmonarchy on the one hand and thoroughgoing democracy on the other.\r\nFollowing in a general way the course of political development in\r\nEngland, we may say that there was an early stage in the growth of the\r\nstate when the power of the king was predominant. Neither the nobility\r\nnor the common people exercised any effective control over him. He was\r\nwhat we may call an absolute monarch. His power was unlimited in the\r\nsense that there were no recognized checks imposed upon it. He was\r\nirresponsible, since no one could call him to account for what he did.\r\n\r\nThe upper classes, however, were anxious to share with the king the\r\ncontrol of the state. Their efforts were directed first toward limiting\r\nhis power by making their own consent necessary before he could enact\r\nany law, carry out any policy, or do any thing of a positive nature. But\r\neven after they had been admitted to this share in the government the\r\nnegative power of the king remained unlimited. The veto power acquired\r\nby the upper classes might prevent him from enacting a particular law,\r\nor enforcing a given policy, but no one had a veto on his inaction. He\r\nmight be unable to do what the classes having a voice in the management\r\nof the government forbade, but he could decline to do what they wished.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of a House of Commons did not change essentially the\r\ncharacter of the scheme, nor would it have done so, had this body been\r\ntruly representative of the people as a whole. It placed an additional\r\ncheck on both King and Lords by giving to the representative body the\r\npower to negative their positive acts. Both the King and the Lords\r\nretained, however, their negative authority unimpaired and could use it\r\nfor the purpose of defeating any measure which the Commons desired. This\r\nis what we may call the check and balance stage of political\r\ndevelopment. Here all positive authority is limited, since its exercise\r\nmay be prevented by the negative power lodged for this purpose in the\r\nother branches of the government. This negative power itself, however,\r\nis absolute and unlimited. The government is in no true sense\r\nresponsible to the people, or any part of them, since they have no\r\npositive control over it.\r\n\r\nThis complex system of restrictions which is the outgrowth and\r\nexpression of a class struggle for the control of the government must\r\nnecessarily disappear when the supremacy of the people is finally\r\nestablished. This brings us to the next and for our present purpose, at\r\nleast, the last stage of political evolution.\r\n\r\nHere the authority of the people is undisputed. Their will is law. The\r\nentire system of checks has been swept away. No irresponsible and\r\ninsignificant minority is longer clothed with power to prevent reform.\r\nThe authority of the government is limited only by its direct and\r\ncomplete responsibility to the people.\r\n\r\nCorresponding to these three stages of political evolution we have three\r\ngeneral types of government:\r\n\r\n1. Unlimited and irresponsible.\r\n\r\n2. Positively limited, negatively unlimited and irresponsible.\r\n\r\n3. Unlimited and responsible.\r\n\r\nAs shown in a previous chapter, the Revolutionary movement largely\r\ndestroyed the system of checks. It abolished the veto power, centralized\r\nauthority and made the government in a measure responsible to the\r\nelectorate. The Constitution, however, restored the old order in a\r\nmodified form. In this sense it was reactionary and retrogressive. It\r\nwent back to the old doctrine of the separation of powers, ostensibly to\r\nlimit the authority of the government and thereby make it responsible to\r\nthe people as Hamilton argued in _The Federalist_. That this could not\r\nhave been the real object is evident to any one who has carefully\r\nstudied the situation. The unthinking reader may accept Hamilton's\r\ncontention that the system of checks and balances was incorporated in\r\nthe Constitution to make the government the servant and agent of the\r\npeople; but the careful student of history can not be so easily misled.\r\nHe knows that the whole system was built up originally as a means of\r\nlimiting monarchical and aristocratic power; that it was not designed to\r\nmake government in any true sense responsible, but to abridge its powers\r\nbecause it was irresponsible. The very existence of the system implies\r\nthe equal recognition in the Constitution of antagonistic elements. As\r\nit could not possibly exist where monarchy or aristocracy was the only\r\nrecognized source of authority in the state, so it is likewise\r\nimpossible where all power is in the people. It is to be observed, then,\r\nthat what originally commended the system to the people was the fact\r\nthat it limited the positive power of the king and aristocracy, while\r\nthe framers of the Constitution adopted it with a view to limiting the\r\npower of the people themselves.\r\n\r\nThere is no essential difference between the viewpoint of the framers of\r\nthe American Constitution and that of their English contemporaries.\r\nLecky says: \"It is curious to observe how closely the aims and standard\r\nof the men who framed the memorable Constitution of 1787 and 1788\r\ncorresponded with those of the English statesmen of the eighteenth\r\ncentury. It is true that the framework adopted was very different....\r\nThe United States did not contain the materials for founding a\r\nconstitutional monarchy or a powerful aristocracy.... It was necessary\r\nto adopt other means, but the ends that were aimed at were much the\r\nsame. To divide and restrict power; to secure property; to check the\r\nappetite for organic change; to guard individual liberty against the\r\ntyranny of the multitude....\"[103]\r\n\r\nOur Constitution was modeled in a general way after the English\r\ngovernment of the eighteenth century. But while the English system of\r\nconstitutional checks was a natural growth, the American system was a\r\npurely artificial contrivance. James Monroe called attention to this\r\nfact in the Virginia convention. He observed that the division of power\r\nin all other governments ancient and modern owed its existence to a\r\nmixture of monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy.[104] This artificial\r\ndivision of power provided for in the Constitution of the United States\r\nwas intended as a substitute for the natural checks upon the people\r\nwhich the existence of king and nobility then supplied in England.\r\n\r\nThis idea of government carried out to its logical conclusion would\r\nrequire that every class and every interest should have a veto on the\r\npolitical action of all the others. No such extended application of the\r\ntheory has ever been made in the actual working of government, nor is it\r\npracticable, since no class can acquire, or having acquired, retain a\r\nveto on the action of the government unless it is large and powerful\r\nenough to enforce its demands. The attempt on the part of a small class\r\nto acquire a constitutional right of this character must of necessity\r\nfail. This is why the system which theoretically tends toward a high\r\ndegree of complexity has not in practice resulted in any very complex\r\nconstitutional arrangements.\r\n\r\nPoland is the best example of the practical working of a system of\r\nchecks carried to an absurd extreme. The political disintegration and\r\nfinal partition of that once powerful country by its neighbors was due\r\nin no small degree to its form of government, which invited anarchy\r\nthrough the great power which it conferred upon an insignificant\r\nminority.\r\n\r\nThe fact that this system can not be carried far enough in practice to\r\nconfer upon every distinct interest or class the veto power as a means\r\nof self defence, has given rise to the doctrine of _laissez faire_. No\r\nclass in control of the government, or even in possession of the power\r\nto negative its acts, has any motive for advocating the let-alone\r\ntheory. Its veto power affords it adequate protection against any\r\nharmful exercise of political authority. But such is not the case with\r\nthose smaller or less fortunate classes or interests which lack this\r\nmeans of self-protection. Since they do not have even a negative control\r\nover the government, they naturally desire to limit the scope of its\r\nauthority. Viewed in this light we may regard the _laissez faire_\r\ndoctrine as merely supplementary to the political theory of checks and\r\nbalances.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see that if the idea of checks were carried out in\r\npractice to its extreme limits, it would lead inevitably to the\r\ndestruction of all positive authority by vesting a veto in each class\r\nand ultimately in each individual. In fact, John C. Calhoun, the ablest\r\nand most consistent expounder of this doctrine, defines a perfect\r\npopular government as \"one which would embrace the consent of every\r\ncitizen or member of the community.\"[105] When this last stage is\r\nreached we would have no government in any proper sense; for each\r\nindividual would be clothed with constitutional power to arrest its\r\naction. Indeed the theory of checks and balances, if taken without any\r\nqualification and followed out consistently, leads naturally to the\r\nacceptance of anarchy as the only scientific system.\r\n\r\nThe absence of king and aristocracy did not deter the members of the\r\nConvention from seeking to follow the English model. In doing this,\r\nhowever, it was necessary to find substitutes for the materials which\r\nwere lacking. The constitutional devices adopted to accomplish this\r\npurpose form the system of checks and are the most original and\r\ninteresting feature of our government.\r\n\r\nThe English model was followed, however, only so far as it served their\r\npurpose. In the case of the judiciary, for instance, they declined to\r\nfollow it; but the reason for this as explained in the preceding chapter\r\nwas their desire to establish a more effective check on the people. They\r\nshowed no special preference for the English form where some other\r\nmethod would better accomplish the desired purpose. Hence in many\r\ninstances they deliberately rejected English precedent, but always with\r\nthe view of providing something that would impose a more effective check\r\non the public will. An apparent exception to this may be found in the\r\nlimited term of President and United States senators. But these were the\r\nvery instances in which lack of king and nobility made departure from\r\nthe English model a matter of necessity. Moreover, any avowed attempt to\r\nprovide an effective substitute for the hereditary branches of the\r\nEnglish model would have been distasteful to the people generally and\r\nfor that reason would have ensured the rejection of the Constitution.\r\nTheoretically, the nearest approach to the English system possible would\r\nhave been life tenure, and there were not wanting those who, like\r\nHamilton, contended for it; but the certainty of popular disapproval was\r\nan unanswerable argument against it.\r\n\r\nIt was thought that substantially the same result could be obtained by\r\nindirect election for moderately long periods. Hence we notice a marked\r\ndeparture from the practice of the state constitutions in term of office\r\nand mode of election. In every state the governor was elected either by\r\nthe legislature or directly by the voters, usually for one year and\r\nnowhere for as long a period as four years.[106] With only two\r\nexceptions[107] the members of the upper legislative chamber were\r\ndirectly elected by the qualified voters, generally for one year and in\r\nno state for as long a term as six years.[108]\r\n\r\nThe desire of the Convention to secure to the President and United\r\nStates Senators more freedom from popular control than was enjoyed by\r\nthe corresponding state officials is most clearly seen in the mode of\r\nelection prescribed.[109] They adopted what Madison called \"the policy\r\nof refining popular appointments by successive filtrations.\" They\r\nprovided that the President should be chosen by an electoral college,\r\nthe members of which were not required to be elected by the people.\r\nThis, it was thought, would guard against the choice of a mere popular\r\nfavorite and ensure the election of a President acceptable to the\r\nconservative and well-to-do classes. It was taken for granted that the\r\nindirect method would enable the minority to control the choice. For a\r\nlike reason they provided that United States senators should be chosen\r\nby the legislatures instead of by the people of the several states.\r\n\r\nThe system as originally adopted did not contemplate, and made no\r\nprovision for the selection of candidates in advance of a popular\r\nelection. But this is not surprising when we reflect that it was the\r\nvery thing they were trying to prevent. They intended that the electoral\r\ncollege should be such in fact as well as in name, that it should have\r\nand exercise the power of independent choice instead of merely\r\nregistering a popular selection already made as if has come in practice\r\nto do. They recognized very clearly that there was a distinct line of\r\ncleavage separating the rich from the poor. They believed with Hamilton\r\nthat in this respect \"all communities divide themselves into the few and\r\nthe many,\"[110] that the latter will tend to combine for the purpose of\r\nobtaining control of the government; and having secured it, will pass\r\nlaws for their own advantage. This, they believed, was the chief danger\r\nof democracy--a danger so real and imminent that it behooved the few to\r\norganize and bring about, if possible, such changes in the government as\r\nwould \"protect the minority of the opulent against the majority.\"[111]\r\nThis was the purpose of the system of checks by which they sought to\r\ngive the former a veto on the acts of the latter. In thus depriving the\r\nmasses of the power to advance their interests through combination, they\r\nthought that the organization of a political party representing the many\r\nas opposed to the few would be discouraged. On the other hand, the few\r\nwhile co-operating for a common purpose, could best accomplish it\r\nwithout any visible party organization or any appearance of concerted\r\naction. Hence the Constitution as originally adopted made no provision\r\nfor the party candidate.\r\n\r\nIn view of the fact that the Constitution was intended to limit the\r\npower of the majority, it is perfectly natural that it should have\r\nattempted to assign to the popular branch of the government a position\r\nof minor importance. This was, of course, in direct opposition to what\r\nhad been the uniform tendency during the Revolutionary period in the\r\nvarious states. In the latter the lower house had been raised to\r\ncoordinate rank with the upper and in Massachusetts, Gerry tells us, the\r\npeople were for abolishing the senate and giving all the powers of\r\ngovernment to the other branch of the legislature.[112]\r\n\r\nIn the Federal Constitution we see a strong reaction against this policy\r\nof enlarging the authority of the lower, and what was assumed to be the\r\nmore popular branch of the legislative body. The House of\r\nRepresentatives was, it is true, given equal power with the Senate in\r\nthe matter of ordinary legislation. But here its equality ends. The\r\ntreaty-making and the appointing power were given to the President and\r\nSenate, where, it was thought, they would be safe from popular\r\ninterference. The effect of this was to make the influence of these two\r\nbranches of the government greatly preponderate over that of the\r\ndirectly elected House. Through the treaty-making power the President\r\nand Senate could in a most important sense legislate without the consent\r\nof the popular branch of Congress. They could enter into agreements with\r\nforeign countries which would have all the force and effect of laws\r\nregularly enacted and which might influence profoundly our whole social,\r\npolitical, and industrial life. The only semblance of a popular check on\r\nthe exercise of this power was to be found in those cases where\r\nappropriations were required to carry treaties into effect. Here the\r\nHouse of Representatives, in theory at least, could defeat the treaty by\r\nrefusing its assent to the necessary appropriation. In practice,\r\nhowever, the House has surrendered this power. A treaty is at no stage\r\n\"submitted to or referred to the House of Representatives, which has no\r\nmore right to be informed about it than ordinary citizens. The President\r\nand the Senate may, for example, cede or annex territories, and yet\r\nnothing of the fact will appear in the discussions of the House of\r\nRepresentatives unless the cession involves expenditure or receipt of\r\nmoney. Besides, I must add that even if the treaty contains clauses\r\nimposing a charge on the public revenue, it is the rule, since\r\nWashington's time, that the House of Representatives should not discuss\r\nthe terms of the treaty adopted by the Senate, but accept it in silence\r\nas an accomplished fact, and simply vote the necessary funds.\"[113]\r\n\r\nThe appointing power was in many respects even more important. It meant\r\nthe right to select those who were to interpret and enforce the laws,\r\nand this really involved the power to mold the spirit and character of\r\nthe government. That this was fully appreciated by those who framed the\r\nConstitution we saw in the preceding chapter.\r\n\r\nThe statement contained in the Constitution that all legislative\r\nauthority is vested in Congress is far from accurate, not only for the\r\nreason above indicated that a portion of it under the guise of\r\ntreaty-making power is conferred on the President and Senate, and the\r\nfurther reason that the Supreme Court exercises legislative authority of\r\ngreat importance, but for the additional reason that the President,\r\naside from his control over treaties, possesses legislative power\r\nco-extensive and co-equal with that of either house. He has been\r\nexpressly given by the Constitution only a qualified veto, but it is so\r\ndifficult for Congress to override it by the necessary two-thirds\r\nmajority that it is in most cases as effective as an absolute\r\nnegative.[114] Attention has been called to the fact that a two-thirds\r\nmajority is difficult to secure even under the most favorable\r\ncircumstances; but here the situation is such as to place practically\r\ninsurmountable obstacles in the way of its attainment. As an\r\nillustration let us suppose that each state is solidly for or against\r\nthe measure which the President has vetoed and that both Senators and\r\nRepresentatives accurately reflect the sentiment of their respective\r\nstates. Then taking the population of the forty-five states in 1900 as\r\nthe basis of our calculation, the smallest popular majority which would\r\nensure the required two-thirds vote in both houses would be obtained by\r\ntaking enough of the smaller states to make the necessary majority in\r\nthe House. But this would mean a popular majority of over 65 per cent.\r\nand an eight-ninths majority in the Senate. To obtain the necessary vote\r\nin both houses by taking the larger states would require a popular\r\nmajority of over 93 per cent. and a nine-tenths majority in the House.\r\nThis gives us some, but by no means an adequate, idea of the President's\r\ncontrol over legislation. He may use in support of his veto all the\r\nother powers which the Constitution has placed in his hands; and when we\r\nconsider the immense influence which he can bring to bear upon Congress,\r\nespecially through his control over appointments, we can readily see the\r\npractical impossibility of enacting any measure which he opposes with\r\nall the powers at his command. Moreover, the President and Senate would,\r\nit was expected, belong to the same class, represent the same interests,\r\nand be equally faithful in guarding the rights of the well-to-do. They\r\nwere to be, therefore, not so much a check on each other, as a double\r\ncheck on the democratic House; and as against the latter, it was the\r\nintention that the qualified negative of the President should, in all\r\nimportant matters concerning which the radical and conservative classes\r\ndisagreed, be fully equivalent to an absolute veto. This follows from\r\nthe fact that the Senate would in such cases sympathize with the action\r\nof the President and refuse to co-operate with the House in overriding\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIt was believed by the framers of the Constitution that the veto power\r\nof the President would be seldom used. This was true until after the\r\nCivil War. Washington used the power only twice; John Adams, Jefferson,\r\nJ.Q. Adams, Van Buren, Taylor, and Fillmore did not make use of it at\r\nall. During the first seventy-six years of our history under the\r\nConstitution the power was exercised only fifty-two times. Andrew\r\nJohnson was the first President to use it freely, vetoing as many acts\r\nas were vetoed by the first eight Presidents. The largest use of the\r\nveto power was by President Cleveland who, during his first term,\r\nexercised it three hundred and one times.[115]\r\n\r\nIn conferring the veto power on the President the members of the\r\nConvention were actuated by the desire to strengthen a conservative\r\nbranch of the government rather than by any desire to copy the English\r\nConstitution, or the constitutions of the American states. As a matter\r\nof fact, the veto power of the Crown was then obsolete, Hamilton himself\r\nremarking in the Convention that it had not been used since the\r\nRevolution of 1688,[116] while in all but two states the last vestige\r\nof it had been destroyed.[117]\r\n\r\nThe position of the President was still further strengthened by\r\ndiscarding the executive council which then existed in every state as a\r\ncheck upon the governor and which was a prominent feature of the English\r\ngovernment of that time. In England this council, forming the Ministry\r\nor Cabinet, had not, it is true, definitely assumed the form which\r\ncharacterizes it now; but it had deprived the King of all power to act\r\nexcept through ministers who were responsible and could be impeached by\r\nParliament. This, of course, had greatly weakened the executive, a fact\r\nwhich fully explains why the framers of the Constitution rejected it and\r\nwent back to the earlier English king whose veto power was unimpaired\r\nfor their model.\r\n\r\nAs their plan contemplated a strong independent executive who would not\r\nhesitate to use the far-reaching powers placed in his hands to defeat\r\nmeasures which he disapproved of, it was necessary to guarantee him\r\nagainst popular removal. In this respect again we see both English and\r\nAmerican constitutional practice disregarded, since neither afforded the\r\ndesired security of tenure. In the various states the governor was\r\nliable to be impeached by the lower branch of the legislature and\r\nexpelled from office when convicted by the senate, which was usually the\r\ncourt before which impeachment cases were tried. A mere majority in\r\neach house was usually sufficient to convict,[118] and as both houses\r\nwere directly elected,[119] it virtually gave the majority of the voters\r\nthe power to remove. This was simply an adaptation of the English\r\npractice which allowed a majority of the Commons to impeach and a\r\nmajority of the Lords to convict. That this had a strong tendency to\r\nmake the legislative body supreme is evident, since the power, if freely\r\nused, would overcome all opposition on the part of either the executive\r\nor the judiciary. Any combination of interests that could command a\r\nmajority in both houses of Parliament could thus enforce its policy.\r\nThis practically destroyed the executive check in the English\r\nConstitution and for that very reason the founders of our government\r\nrejected it. They clearly saw that to make the President's veto\r\neffective, he would have to be protected in its exercise. To have\r\nadopted the English practice and allowed a mere majority of the Senate\r\nto convict in impeachment cases would have given Congress power to\r\ndestroy the President's veto by impeaching and removing from office any\r\nexecutive who dared to use it. This was guarded against by making, a\r\ntwo-thirds majority in the Senate necessary to convict any official\r\nimpeached by the House. And since this two-thirds majority is one which\r\nin practice can not be obtained, the power to impeach may be regarded,\r\nlike the power to amend, as practically non-existent. Only two\r\nconvictions have been obtained since the Constitution was adopted. John\r\nPickering, a Federal district judge, was convicted March 12, 1803, and\r\nremoved from office, and at the outbreak of the Civil War a Federal\r\ndistrict judge of Tennessee, West H. Humphreys, who joined the\r\nConfederacy without resigning, was convicted. William Blount was\r\nacquitted in 1798 on the ground that, as a United States senator, he was\r\nnot a \"civil officer\" within the meaning of the impeachment provision of\r\nthe Constitution, and so not liable to impeachment. Samuel Chase,\r\nAssociate Justice of the United States Supreme Court, President Andrew\r\nJohnson, and Secretary of War, William W. Belknap, would have been\r\nconvicted but for the extraordinary majority required in the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe practical impossibility of removing a public official by means of\r\nimpeachment proceedings has made the executive and the judicial veto\r\nthoroughly effective, since it has deprived Congress of all power to\r\npunish by removing from office those officials who thwart its purpose.\r\nIt has made the President and the Supreme Court much stronger than the\r\nHouse of Representatives--a result which the framers of the Constitution\r\nno doubt desired.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the President's qualified veto on laws about to be\r\npassed, which, as we have seen, amounts in practice to an unlimited\r\nnegative, he has what may be called an absolute veto on their execution.\r\nThis is the necessary consequence of his complete independence, taken in\r\nconnection with his power of appointment and removal. Controlling the\r\nadministrative arm of the government, he can execute the laws of\r\nCongress or not as he may see fit. He may even fail to enforce an act\r\nwhich he himself signed, inasmuch as his approval in a legislative\r\ncapacity does not bar his subsequent disapproval as an executive. Of\r\ncourse, it does not follow that this power is openly and avowedly\r\nexercised. Usually it is not. An easier and more effective method is the\r\none which obscures the real intention of the executive by a sham attempt\r\nat enforcement.\r\n\r\nIt may be contended that the Constitution makes it his duty to enforce\r\nall laws without regard to his own views of their wisdom or expediency.\r\nThis contention, however, does not appear to be borne out by the purpose\r\nof the Constitution itself. It was not the intention of the framers of\r\nthat instrument to make the President a mere administrative agent of\r\nCongress, but rather to set him over against that body and make him in a\r\nlarge measure the judge of his own authority. If it be claimed that it\r\nis his duty to enforce all laws that have been regularly enacted, it\r\nmust at the same time be conceded that the Constitution permits their\r\nnon-enforcement, since it has given neither to Congress nor to the\r\npeople any effective power to remove him for neglect of duty. Moreover,\r\nhis oath of office does not expressly bind him to enforce the laws of\r\nCongress, but merely to \"execute the office of President ... and\r\npreserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United\r\nStates.\"[120]\r\n\r\nThis omission can not be satisfactorily explained as a mere oversight.\r\nThe Massachusetts constitution of 1780, from which the fathers copied\r\nthe qualified veto power, required the governor to take an oath in which\r\nhe obligated himself to perform the duties of his office \"agreeably to\r\nthe rules and regulations of the constitution and the laws of the\r\ncommonwealth.\" There was no precedent in any then existing state\r\nconstitution for expressly binding the executive in his oath of office\r\nto defend the Constitution without mentioning his duty to enforce the\r\nlaws. It is a reasonable inference that the framers of the Constitution\r\nintended to impress the President with the belief that his obligation to\r\ndefend the Constitution was more binding upon him than his duty to\r\nenforce the laws enacted by Congress.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing discussion it has been shown that political authority\r\nwas unequally divided between the various branches of the government;\r\nto the extent that this was the case the framers of the Constitution\r\ndid not adhere consistently to the theory of checks. But in this, as in\r\nother instances where they departed from precedents which they professed\r\nto be following, they were actuated by a desire to minimize the direct\r\ninfluence of the people. If the Constitution had been framed in complete\r\naccord with the doctrine of checks and balances, the lower house of\r\nCongress as the direct representative of the people would have been\r\ngiven a veto on the entire policy of the government. But this, as we\r\nhave seen, was not done. The more important powers were placed under the\r\nexclusive control of the other branches of the government over which it\r\nwas believed public opinion would have but little influence. This\r\ndeprived the people of the unlimited negative to which they were\r\nentitled even according to the theory of checks. Richard Henry Lee did\r\nnot greatly exaggerate then when he said: \"The only check to be found in\r\nfavor of the democratic principle, in this system, is the House of\r\nRepresentatives, which, I believe, may justly be called a mere shred or\r\nrag of representation.\"[121] Nor was Mason entirely mistaken when he\r\nreferred to the House of Representatives as \"the shadow only\" and not\r\n\"the substance of representation.\"[122]\r\n\r\nIt may be thought, even though the Constitution does not give the House\r\nof Representatives a direct negative on all the important acts of the\r\ngovernment, that it does so indirectly through its control over the\r\npurse. An examination of the system with reference to this question,\r\nhowever, reveals the fact that the control of the House over taxation\r\nand expenditure is narrowly limited. A revenue law is subject to no\r\nconstitutional limitation, and when once enacted remains in force until\r\nrepealed by subsequent legislation. Assuming that a revenue system has\r\nbeen established which is sufficient for the needs of the government,\r\nthe House can exercise no further control over income. It can not repeal\r\nit, or modify it in any way without the consent of the President and\r\nSenate.\r\n\r\nTurning now to the matter of expenditure, we find that the Constitution\r\nallows permanent provision to be made for the needs of the government,\r\nwith the single exception of the army, for the support of which no funds\r\ncan be appropriated for a longer period than two years. The policy of\r\npermanent appropriations has not yet been applied to the full extent\r\npermitted by the Constitution, but it has been carried much further than\r\na consistent adherence to the doctrine of popular control over the\r\nbudget would warrant. The practice could easily be extended until every\r\nwant of the government except the expenses of the army, even including\r\nthe maintenance of the navy, had been provided for by permanent\r\nappropriations. And it may be added that with the increasing desire for\r\nstability which comes with the development of vast business interests,\r\nthe tendency is strongly in that direction.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose that some political party, for the time being in control\r\nof the law-making power of the government, should extend the practice of\r\nmaking permanent appropriations to the extreme limit allowed by the\r\nConstitution. This would relieve the administration of all financial\r\ndependence upon public sentiment except in the management of the army.\r\nAnd if, as the framers of the Constitution contemplated, the President\r\nand the Senate should represent the minority, the administration might\r\nfor years pursue a policy to which public opinion had come to be\r\nstrongly opposed. For with the system once adopted its repeal could not\r\nbe effected without the concurrence of all branches of the law-making\r\nauthority. The President and Congress could, in anticipation of an\r\nadverse majority in the House, guard against the withdrawal of financial\r\nsupport from their policy by simply making permanent provision for their\r\nneeds. Our present system would permit this to be done even after the\r\nparty in power had been overwhelmingly defeated at the polls, since the\r\nsecond session of the old congress does not begin until after the\r\nmembers of the new House of Representatives have been elected.[123]\r\nThis would tie the hands of any adverse popular majority in a succeeding\r\ncongress and effectually deprive it of even a veto on the income and\r\nexpenditure of the government, until such time as it should also gain\r\ncontrol of the Presidency and the Senate. But this last could never have\r\nhappened if the practical working of the Constitution had been what its\r\nframers intended. Whatever control, then, the majority may now exercise\r\nover taxation and public expenditure has thus been acquired less through\r\nany constitutional provisions intended to secure it, than in spite of\r\nthose which seemingly made it impossible.\r\n\r\nEqually significant was the failure of the Convention to make any\r\nadequate provision for enforcing publicity. The Constitution says \"a\r\nregular statement of the receipts and expenditures of public money shall\r\nbe published from time to time,\" and also that \"each House shall keep a\r\njournal of its proceedings, and from time to time publish the same,\r\nexcept such parts as may in their judgment required secrecy.\"[124] That\r\nthese provisions were of little practical value is evident from the fact\r\nthat they contain no definite statement as to when and how often the\r\naccounts and journals are to be published. The phrase _from time to\r\ntime_ was susceptible of almost any interpretation that either house of\r\nCongress or the President might wish to give it, and could easily have\r\nbeen so construed as to justify a method of publication which gave the\r\npeople but little information concerning the present state of public\r\naffairs. The framers of the Constitution did not believe that the\r\nmanagement of the government was in any proper sense the people's\r\nbusiness; yet they realized that the people themselves took a different\r\nview of the matter, which made some constitutional guarantee of\r\npublicity necessary. It was, however, the form rather than the substance\r\nof such a guarantee which the Constitution contained.\r\n\r\nNeither house of Congress is required by the Constitution to hold open\r\nsittings or publish its speeches and debates.[125] Until 1799 the Senate\r\nexercised its constitutional right to transact public business in\r\nsecret; and during that period preserved no record of its debates. This\r\npolicy did not win for it the confidence of the people, and until after\r\nit was in a measure abandoned, the Senate, notwithstanding the important\r\npowers conferred on it by the Constitution, was not a very influential\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nTo deny the right of the people to control the government leads\r\nnaturally to denial of their right to criticise those who shape its\r\npolicy; since if free and unrestricted discussion and even condemnation\r\nof official conduct were allowed, no system of minority rule could long\r\nsurvive. This was well understood in the Federal Convention. The members\r\nof that body saw that the constitutional right of public officials to\r\ndisregard the wishes of the people was incompatible with the right of\r\nthe latter to drag them before the bar of public opinion. Hence some\r\nlimitation of the right to criticise public officials was necessary to\r\nsafeguard and preserve their official independence. This seems to have\r\nbeen the purpose of the Constitution in providing with reference to\r\nmembers of Congress that \"for any speech or debate in either House they\r\nshall not be questioned in any other place.\"[126]\r\n\r\nThis provision may be traced to the English Bill of Rights where it was\r\nintended as a means of protecting members of Parliament against\r\nimprisonment and prosecution for opposing the arbitrary acts of the\r\nCrown. It was at first merely an assertion of the independence of the\r\nLords and Commons as against the King, and a denial of the right of the\r\nlatter to call them to account for anything said or done in their\r\nlegislative capacity. But after it had accomplished its original purpose\r\nand the tyrannical power of the King had been overthrown, it was found\r\nto be serviceable in warding off attacks from another direction. It thus\r\ncame about that the means devised and employed by Parliament to shield\r\nits members against intimidation and oppression at the hands of the King\r\nwas later turned against the people; for Parliament in divesting the\r\nKing of his irresponsible authority was desirous only of establishing\r\nits own supremacy. It jealously guarded its own prerogatives, claimed\r\nthe right to govern independently, and just as formerly it had resisted\r\nthe encroachments of royal authority, it now resented the efforts of the\r\npeople to influence its policy by the publication and criticism of its\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\nA standing order passed by the House of Commons in 1728 declared \"that\r\nit is an indignity to, and a breach of, the privilege of this House for\r\nany person to presume to give in written or printed newspapers, any\r\naccount or minute of the debates or other proceedings; that upon\r\ndiscovery of the authors, printers, or publishers of any such newspaper\r\nthis House will proceed against the offenders with the utmost\r\nseverity.\"[127]\r\n\r\nThis was the attitude of Parliament down to 1771, when, after a\r\nprolonged and bitter struggle, the House of Commons was finally driven\r\nby the force of an overwhelming public sentiment to acquiesce in the\r\npublication of its proceedings.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, a small minority in the House that opposed the\r\npolicy of prosecuting the representatives of the press. The following\r\nextract from the Annual Register for 1771 describes the attitude of this\r\nminority.\r\n\r\n\"Some gentlemen however did not rest their opposition on the points of\r\ndecorum and prudence, but went so far as to deny the authority of the\r\nHouse in this respect, and said that it was an usurpation assumed in bad\r\ntimes, in the year 1641; that while their privileges and authority were\r\nused in defense of the rights of the people, against the violence of the\r\nprerogative, all men willingly joined in supporting them, and even their\r\nusurpations were considered as fresh securities to their independence;\r\nbut now that they saw their own weapons converted to instruments of\r\ntyranny and oppression against themselves, they would oppose them with\r\nall their might, and, however they may fail in the first efforts, would\r\nfinally prevail, and assuredly bring things back to their first\r\nprinciples. They also said that the practice of letting the constituents\r\nknow the parliamentary proceedings of their representatives was founded\r\nupon the truest principles of the Constitution; and that even the\r\npublishing of supposed speeches was not a novel practice, and if\r\nprecedent was a justification, could be traced to no less an authority\r\nthan Lord Clarendon.\"[128]\r\n\r\n\"In the early years of the colonial era the right of free speech was not\r\nalways well guarded. There was frequent legislation, for example,\r\nagainst 'seditious utterances,' a term which might mean almost anything.\r\nIn 1639 the Maryland assembly passed an act for 'determining enormous\r\noffences,' among which were included 'scandalous or contemptuous words\r\nor writings to the dishonor of the lord proprietarie or his lieutenant\r\ngenerall for the time being, or any of the council.' By a North Carolina\r\nact of 1715 seditious utterances against the government was made a\r\ncriminal offence, and in 1724 Joseph Castleton, for malicious language\r\nagainst Governor Burrington and for other contemptuous remarks, was\r\nsentenced by the general court to stand in the pillory for two hours and\r\non his knees to beg the governor's pardon. A New Jersey act of 1675\r\nrequired that persons found guilty of resisting the authority of the\r\ngovernor or councillors 'either in words or actions ... by speaking\r\ncontemptuously, reproachfully, or maliciously, of any of them,' should\r\nbe liable to fine, banishment, or corporal punishment at the discretion\r\nof the court. In Massachusetts even during the eighteenth century the\r\nright of free political discussion was denied by the House of\r\nRepresentatives as well as by the royal governor, though often\r\nunsuccessfully.\"[129]\r\n\r\n\"The general publication of parliamentary debates dates only from the\r\nAmerican Revolution, and even then it was still considered a technical\r\nbreach of privilege.\r\n\r\n\"The American colonies followed the practice of the parent country. Even\r\nthe laws were not at first published for general circulation, and it\r\nseemed to be thought desirable by the magistrates to keep the people in\r\nignorance of the precise boundary between that which was lawful and that\r\nwhich was prohibited, as more likely to avoid all doubtful actions....\r\n\r\n\"The public bodies of the united nation did not at once invite publicity\r\nto their deliberations. The Constitutional Convention of 1787 sat with\r\nclosed doors, and although imperfect reports of the debates have since\r\nbeen published, the injunction of secrecy upon its members was never\r\nremoved. The Senate for a time followed this example, and the first open\r\ndebate was had in 1793, on the occasion of the controversy over the\r\nright of Mr. Gallatin to a seat in that body. The House of\r\nRepresentatives sat with open doors from the first, tolerating the\r\npresence of reporters,--over whose admission, however, the Speaker\r\nassumed control,--and refusing in 1796 the pittance of two thousand\r\ndollars for full publication of its debates.\r\n\r\n\"It must be evident from these historical facts that liberty of the\r\npress, as now understood and enjoyed, is of very recent origin.\"[130]\r\n\r\nBoth the original purpose of this parliamentary privilege and its\r\nsubsequent abuse not only in England but also in the Colonies, were\r\nfacts well known by those who framed the Constitution. There was no King\r\nhere, from whose arbitrary acts Congress would need to be protected, but\r\nthere was a power which the framers of the Constitution regarded as no\r\nless tyrannical and fully as much to be feared--the power of the people\r\nas represented by the numerical majority. How to guard against this new\r\nspecies of tyranny was the problem that confronted them. The majority\r\nwas just as impatient of restraint, just as eager to brush aside all\r\nopposition as king or aristocracy had ever been in the past. Taking this\r\nview of the matter, it was but natural that they should seek to protect\r\nCongress against the people as Parliament had formerly been protected\r\nagainst the Crown. For exactly the same reason as we have seen, they\r\nmade the judges independent of the people as they had been made\r\nindependent of the King in England. In no other way was it possible to\r\nlimit the power of the majority.\r\n\r\nThat this provision concerning freedom of speech and debate in the\r\nlegislative body was not regarded as especially important during the\r\nRevolutionary period is shown by its absence from most of the early\r\nstate constitutions. When the Federal Constitution was framed only three\r\nof the original states[131] had adopted constitutions containing such a\r\nprovision. There was, as a matter of fact, no real need for it in the\r\nstate constitutions of that time. The controlling influence exerted by\r\nthe legislature in the state government, and the dependence of the\r\ncourts upon that body, precluded the possibility of any abuse of their\r\npowers in this direction.\r\n\r\nThe Articles of Confederation contained the provision that \"Freedom of\r\nspeech and debate in Congress shall not be impeached or questioned in\r\nany court or place out of Congress.\"[132] This was designed to protect\r\nmembers of Congress against prosecution in the state courts. Here, as in\r\nthe English Bill of Rights and in the state constitutions containing a\r\nsimilar provision, reference is made in express terms to prosecution in\r\nthe courts. The framers of the Constitution, however, left out all\r\nreference to the courts. If, as constitutional writers have generally\r\nassumed, the framers of the Constitution intended by this provision to\r\nprotect members of Congress against prosecution in the courts, it is\r\ndifficult to understand why they should have omitted what had been the\r\nmain feature and purpose of this provision, not only in the original\r\nBill of Rights, but also in the state constitutions copying it and in\r\nthe Articles of Confederation. If what they had in mind was the danger\r\nof prosecution in the state or Federal courts, why should they have\r\nchanged completely the wording of this provision by omitting all\r\nreference to the very danger which they wished to guard against?\r\n\r\nThe checks thus far described were intended as a substitute for king and\r\naristocracy; but to make the Constitution acceptable to the people,\r\nadditional checks were required which the English government did not\r\ncontain. The division of authority in the latter was solely between\r\ndifferent classes or orders, each of which was supposed to represent\r\ninterests co-extensive with the realm. But while the power of each class\r\nwas thus limited, their joint and combined action was subject to no\r\nconstitutional check or limitation whatever. Any policy upon which they\r\nagreed could be enforced in any part of the realm, since the\r\nConstitution, recognizing no local interests, gave no political\r\nsubdivision a negative on the acts of the whole. The government of\r\nEngland, then, was purely _national_ as opposed to _federal_, that is to\r\nsay the general government was supreme in all respects and the local\r\ngovernment merely its creature.\r\n\r\nThis was the type of government for which Hamilton contended and which a\r\nmajority of the delegates in the Federal Convention really favored. But\r\nthe difficulty of securing the adoption of a Constitution framed on this\r\nplan made it impracticable. To merge the separate states in a general\r\ngovernment possessing unlimited authority would place all local\r\ninterests at the mercy of what the people regarded as virtually a\r\nforeign power. Practical considerations, then, required that the\r\nConstitution should in appearance at least conform to the _federal_\r\nrather than to the _national_ type. Accordingly the powers of government\r\nwere divided into two classes, one embracing only those of an admittedly\r\ngeneral character, which were enumerated and delegated to the general\r\ngovernment, while the rest were left in the possession of the states. In\r\nform and appearance the general government and the governments of the\r\nvarious states were coordinate and supplementary, each being supreme and\r\nsovereign within its respective sphere. By this arrangement any\r\nappearance of subordination on the part of the state governments was\r\ncarefully avoided; and since the state retained sovereign authority\r\nwithin the sphere assigned to it by the Constitution, the protection of\r\nlocal interests was thereby guaranteed. This understanding of the\r\nConstitution seems to have been encouraged by those who desired its\r\nadoption and was undoubtedly the only interpretation which would have\r\nfound favor with the people generally. Moreover, it was a perfectly\r\nnatural and logical development of the theory of checks. If the\r\nPresident, Senate, House of Representatives and the Supreme Court were\r\ncoordinate branches of the general government, and each therefore a\r\ncheck on the authority of the others, a like division of authority\r\nbetween the general government as a whole on the one hand, and the\r\nstates on the other, must of necessity imply a defensive power in the\r\nstate to prevent encroachment on the authority reserved to it. And since\r\nthe government was _federal_ and not _national_, and since the state\r\ngovernment was coordinate with and not subordinate to the general\r\ngovernment, the conclusion was inevitable that the former was a check on\r\nthe latter in exactly the same way that each branch of the general\r\ngovernment was a check on the others.\r\n\r\nThis view of the Constitution while allowed to go unchallenged for the\r\ntime being to secure its adoption by the states, was not accepted,\r\nhowever, by those who framed it. For although in outward appearance the\r\nConstitution did not provide for a national government, it at least\r\ncontained the germs out of which a national government might in time be\r\ndeveloped. The complete supremacy of the general government was one\r\nimportant result which the members of the Convention desired to bring\r\nabout. Several plans were proposed by which this supremacy should be\r\nexpressly recognized in the Constitution. Both Randolph and Charles\r\nPinckney favored giving a negative on state laws to Congress.[133]\r\nMadison suggested giving it to the Senate. Hamilton, as we have seen,\r\nproposed giving an absolute veto to the governors of the various states,\r\nwho were to be appointed by the President. According to another plan\r\nthis power was to be given jointly to the President and the judges of\r\nthe Supreme Court. All of these proposals to give the general government\r\nin express terms the power to annul state laws were finally rejected by\r\nthe Convention, no doubt for the reason that they indicated too clearly\r\ntheir intention to subordinate the state governments. But while\r\ndeclining to confer this power in express terms, it was not their\r\nintention to withhold it. As in the case of the judicial veto on\r\ncongressional legislation, they relied upon control over the\r\nConstitution after its adoption to accomplish their end.\r\n\r\nThe omission from the Constitution of any provision which clearly and\r\nunequivocally defined the relation of the general government to the\r\ngovernments of the various states was not a mere oversight. The members\r\nof the Convention evidently thought that to ensure the acceptance of the\r\nConstitution, it was necessary to submit it in a form least likely to\r\nexcite the opposition of the states. They expected by controlling its\r\ninterpretation to be able after its adoption to mold it into a shape\r\nmore in accord with their own views. The choice of this method, though\r\nthe only one by which it was possible to attain their end, involved\r\nconsequences more serious and far-reaching than they imagined. It paved\r\nthe way for a constitutional struggle which lasted for three-quarters of\r\na century and finally convulsed the country in the greatest civil war of\r\nmodern times. Had the Constitution in so many words expressly declared\r\nthat the Federal judiciary should have the power to annul state laws, or\r\nhad it given this power to some other branch of the Federal government\r\nin accordance with some one of the suggestions above mentioned, and had\r\nit at the same time expressly withheld from the states the power to\r\nnegative acts of Congress, there would have been no room for doubt that\r\nthe general government was the final and exclusive judge in all cases of\r\nconflict between Federal and state authority.\r\n\r\nSuch a provision would have left no room for the doctrine of state\r\nrights, or its corollary--the power of a state to nullify a Federal law.\r\nIt would have settled the question of Federal supremacy beyond the\r\npossibility of controversy by relegating the states to a strictly\r\nsubordinate place in our political system. But inasmuch as the\r\nConstitution contained no provision of this character it left the states\r\nin a position to defend their claim to coordinate rank with the general\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThe adoption of the Constitution was merely the first step in this\r\nprogram of political reconstruction. To carry through to a successful\r\nissue the work undertaken by the Federal Convention, it was necessary\r\nthat the same influences that dominated the latter should also control\r\nthe new government by which the Constitution was to be interpreted and\r\napplied. How well they succeeded may be seen in the impress left upon\r\nour system by the twelve years of Federalist rule which followed its\r\nadoption. During this period the Constitution was in the hands of those\r\nwho were in full sympathy with the purpose of its framers, and who\r\nsought to complete the work which they had begun.\r\n\r\nIn shaping the policy of the government during this period the influence\r\nof Hamilton was even more pronounced than it had been in the Federal\r\nConvention. As Secretary of the Treasury he proposed and brought about\r\nthe adoption of a financial policy in harmony with his political views.\r\nBelieving that the government must have the confidence of the\r\nconservative and well-to-do classes, he framed a policy which was\r\ncalculated to gain their support by appealing to their material\r\ninterests. The assumption by the general government of the state debts\r\nincurred during the Revolutionary war was designed and had the effect\r\nof detaching the creditor class from dependence upon the governments of\r\nthe various states and allying them to the general government. The\r\nprotective tariff system also had far-reaching political significance.\r\nIt was expected to develop an influential manufacturing class who would\r\nlook to the general government as the source of their prosperity, and\r\nwho would therefore support its authority as against that of the states.\r\nTo unite the moneyed interests and identify them with the general\r\ngovernment was one of the reasons for chartering the bank of the United\r\nStates. The internal revenue system which enabled the general government\r\nto place its officials in every community and make its authority\r\ndirectly felt throughout all the states was a political as well as a\r\nfinancial measure. It was prompted partly by the desire to appropriate\r\nthis field of taxation before it was laid hold of by the states and\r\npartly by the desire to accustom the people to the exercise of Federal\r\nauthority. All these measures which were formulated by Hamilton and\r\ncarried through largely by his influence were intended to lay a solid\r\nbasis for the development of national as opposed to state authority.\r\n\r\nIt was the purpose of the Constitution as we have seen to establish the\r\nsupremacy of the so-called upper class. To consolidate its various\r\nelements and bring the government under their control was the aim of the\r\nFederalist party.\r\n\r\nThat such a policy should have aroused much popular opposition and\r\nprovoked bitter criticism was to be expected. Criticism, however, was\r\nespecially irritating to those who accepted the Federalist theory of\r\ngovernment. For if the few had a right to rule the many, then the\r\nlatter, as a matter of course, ought to treat the former with respect;\r\nsince otherwise the power and influence of the minority might be\r\noverthrown.\r\n\r\nThe Alien and Sedition laws by which the governing class sought to\r\nrepress criticism were the logical culmination of this movement to limit\r\nthe power of the majority. This attempt, however, to muzzle the press\r\nand overthrow the right of free speech instead of silencing the\r\nopposition only strengthened and intensified it. It merely augmented the\r\nrising tide of popular disapproval which was soon to overwhelm the\r\nFederalist party.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution, as we have seen, did not expressly subordinate the\r\nstates. Although framed by those who wished to make the general\r\ngovernment supreme, it contained no provision which could not be so\r\nconstrued as to harmonize with the widely accepted doctrine of state\r\nrights. It was represented by its framers and understood by the people\r\ngenerally as dividing sovereignty between the general government on the\r\none hand and the states on the other. Within the province assigned to\r\nthe state, it was to be supreme, which would naturally seem to imply\r\nadequate constitutional power in the state to defend itself against\r\nfederal aggression. This view of the Constitution, if not actually\r\nencouraged, was allowed to go unchallenged in order not to endanger its\r\nadoption.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution is and was intended to be rigid only in the sense that\r\nit effectually limits the power of the majority. The founders of our\r\ngovernment were not averse to such changes in the system which they\r\nestablished as would promote or at least not interfere with their main\r\npurpose--the protection of the minority against the majority. Indeed,\r\nthey intended that the Constitution as framed should be modified,\r\namended and gradually molded by judicial interpretation into the form\r\nwhich they desired to give it, but which the necessity of minimizing\r\npopular opposition prevented them from accomplishing at the outset.\r\nAmendment by judicial interpretation was merely a means of conferring\r\nindirectly on the minority a power which the Constitution expressly\r\ndenied to the majority. No hint of this method of minority amendment,\r\nhowever, was contained in the Constitution itself. But, on the contrary,\r\nany such view of the Constitution would have been negatived by the\r\ngeneral theory of checks and balances which, consistently applied, would\r\nlimit the power of the minority as well as that of the majority. It was\r\nnot reasonable to suppose that the Constitution contemplated placing in\r\nthe hands of the minority a power which it was so careful to withold\r\nfrom the majority. In fact, the language of the Constitution warranted\r\nthe belief that it was intended as a means of checking the general\r\ngovernment itself by protecting the states in the exercise of all those\r\npowers not expressly denied to them. And since the Constitution, as we\r\nhave seen, merely marked off the limits of federal and state\r\njurisdiction, without specifying how the general government on the one\r\nhand, or the state government on the other, was to be kept within the\r\nterritory assigned to it, it was natural to suppose that it contemplated\r\ngiving to each the same means of protecting itself against the\r\nencroachments of the other.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, when Congress appeared to overstep the limits which the\r\nConstitution set to its authority, the states naturally looked for some\r\nmeans of making the checks imposed upon the general government\r\neffective. True, the Constitution itself did not specify how this was to\r\nbe done; but neither could one find in it any provision for enforcing\r\nthe limitations on the authority of the states. The general government,\r\nhowever, had supplied itself with the means of self-protection by\r\ncalling into existence the veto power of the Federal judiciary. This\r\nmade the checks upon the authority of the states operative. But how were\r\nthose imposed by the Constitution on the general government itself to be\r\nenforced? Not by the Federal government or any of its organs, since\r\nthis would allow it to interpret the Constitution to suit itself. If the\r\ngeneral government should have the right to interpret and enforce the\r\nconstitutional limitations on the powers of the states, it would for a\r\nlike reason follow that the states should interpret and enforce the\r\nconstitutional limitations on the authority of the general government\r\nitself. To carry out in good faith what appeared to be the purpose of\r\nthe Constitution, _i.e._, to limit the authority of the general\r\ngovernment as well as that of the states, it would seem to be necessary\r\nto make each the judge of the other's powers. It would devolve then on\r\nthe state governments to keep the general government within the bounds\r\nwhich the Constitution set to its authority.\r\n\r\nThis could be accomplished, however, in no other way than by a veto on\r\nsuch acts of the general government as, in the opinion of the state,\r\nexceeded its constitutional authority. Those who believed in a federal\r\nas opposed to a national government and who therefore wished to enforce\r\nthe constitutional checks on the general government, were irresistibly\r\nimpelled toward the doctrine of nullification as the sole means of\r\nprotecting the rights of the states.\r\n\r\nAs Von Holst says, \"Calhoun and his disciples were not the authors of\r\nthe doctrine of nullification and secession. That question is as old as\r\nthe Constitution itself, and has always been a living one, even when it\r\nhas not been one of life and death. Its roots lay in the actual\r\ncircumstances of the time, and the Constitution was the living\r\nexpression of these actual circumstances.\"[134]\r\n\r\nMadison, in _The Federalist_, refers in a vague and indefinite manner to\r\nthe power of a state to oppose an unjustifiable act of the Federal\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n\"Should an unwarrantable measure of the Federal government,\" he says,\r\n\"be unpopular in particular states ... the means of opposition to it are\r\npowerful and at hand. The disquietude of the people; their repugnance,\r\nand perhaps refusal, to co-operate with the officers of the union; the\r\nfrowns of the executive magistracy of the state; the embarrassments\r\ncreated by legislative devices, which would often be added on such\r\noccasions, would oppose, in any state, difficulties not to be despised;\r\nwould form in a large state, very serious impediments; and where the\r\nsentiments of several adjoining states happened to be in unison, would\r\npresent obstructions which the Federal government would hardly be\r\nwilling to encounter.\"[135]\r\n\r\nAgain he says, \"The state government will have the advantage of the\r\nFederal government, whether we compare them in respect to the immediate\r\ndependence of the one on the other; to the weight of personal influence\r\nwhich each side will possess; to the powers respectively vested in them;\r\nto the predilection and probable support of the people; to the\r\ndisposition and faculty of resisting and frustrating the measures of\r\neach other.\"[136]\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful whether Madison, in writing the passages above quoted,\r\nhad in mind any thing more than a general policy of opposition and\r\nobstruction on the part of the states. He certainly intended, however,\r\nto convey the idea that under the proposed Constitution the states would\r\nhave no difficulty in defending their constitutional rights against any\r\nattempted usurpation at the hands of the Federal government. We can\r\ntrace the gradual development of this idea of state resistance to\r\nFederal authority until it finally assumes a definite form in the\r\ndoctrine of nullification.\r\n\r\n\"A resolution [in the Maryland legislature] declaring the independence\r\nof the state governments to be jeopardized by the assumption of the\r\nstate debts by the Union was rejected only by the casting vote of the\r\nspeaker. In Virginia the two houses of the legislature sent a joint\r\nmemorial to Congress. They expressed the hope that the funding act would\r\nbe reconsidered and that the law providing for the assumption of the\r\nstate debts would be repealed. A change in the present form of the\r\ngovernment of the union, pregnant with disaster, would, it was said, be\r\nthe presumptive consequence of the last act named, which the house of\r\ndelegates had formally declared to be in violation of the Constitution\r\nof the United States.\"[137]\r\n\r\nThe general assembly of Virginia in 1798 adopted resolutions declaring\r\nthat it viewed \"the powers of the Federal government ... as limited by\r\nthe plain sense and intention of [the Constitution] ... and that, in\r\ncase of a deliberate, palpable, and dangerous exercise of other powers,\r\nnot granted, ... the states ... have the right, and are in duty bound,\r\nto interpose, for arresting the progress of the evil, and for\r\nmaintaining within their respective limits, the authority, rights, and\r\nliberties appertaining to them.\" These resolutions were drawn by Madison\r\nwho had now come to oppose the strong centralizing policy of the\r\nFederalists.\r\n\r\nA more explicit statement of this doctrine is to be found in the\r\nKentucky Resolutions of 1798 which declared \"that the several states\r\ncomposing the United States of America are not united on the principle\r\nof unlimited submission to their general government; ... and that\r\nwhenever the general government assumes undelegated powers, its acts are\r\nunauthoritative, void, and of no force; that to this compact each state\r\nacceded as a state, and is an integral party; that this government,\r\ncreated by this compact, was not made the exclusive or final judge of\r\nthe extent of the powers delegated to itself, since that would have made\r\nits discretion, and not the Constitution, the measure of its powers; but\r\nthat as in all other cases of compact among parties having no common\r\njudge, _each party has an equal right to judge for itself, as well of\r\ninfractions as of the mode and measure of redress_.\"\r\n\r\nThe Kentucky resolutions of 1799 go one step farther and give definite\r\nexpression to the doctrine of nullification. They declare \"that the\r\nseveral states who formed that instrument [the Constitution], being\r\nsovereign and independent, have the unquestionable right to judge of the\r\ninfraction; and, _that a nullification, by those sovereignties, of all\r\nunauthorized acts done under color of that instrument, is the rightful\r\nremedy_.\"\r\n\r\nThe first clear and unequivocal statement of the doctrine of\r\nnullification may be traced to Jefferson. In the original draft of the\r\nKentucky resolutions of 1798, which he wrote, it is asserted that where\r\nthe Federal government assumes powers \"which have not been delegated, a\r\nnullification of the act is the rightful remedy; that every state has a\r\nnatural right in cases not within the compact (_casus non foederis_) to\r\nnullify of their own authority, all assumptions of power by others\r\nwithin their limits.\"[138] This was omitted, however, from the\r\nresolutions as finally adopted, although included in substance, as we\r\nhave seen, in the Kentucky resolutions of 1799.\r\n\r\nJefferson's authorship of the original draft of the Kentucky resolutions\r\nof 1798 is made the basis of Von Holst's contention that he was the\r\nfather of the doctrine of nullification. This, however, is something of\r\nan exaggeration. He is more accurate when he refers to the doctrine as\r\nbeing as old as the Constitution itself and the outgrowth of the\r\ncircumstances of the time. The prevalent conception of the state as a\r\ncheck upon the Federal government derived support, as we have seen, from\r\nthe efforts of the framers of the Constitution themselves to give it an\r\ninterpretation that would remove as far as possible the obstacles to its\r\nratification by allaying the fears and jealousy of the states. The idea\r\nthat the state government could oppose and resist an unconstitutional\r\nexercise of authority by the Federal government was widely accepted as a\r\ngeneral principle, although little attention had been given to the\r\npractical application of the doctrine. Jefferson merely gave definite\r\nform to what had been a more or less vague conception by showing how the\r\nconstitutional checks upon the Federal government could be made\r\neffective.\r\n\r\nThe best statement of this doctrine, however, is to be found in the\r\nworks of John C. Calhoun, whose Disquisition on Government and\r\nDiscourse on the Constitution of the United States are a masterly\r\ndefense of the system of checks and balances. He had no sympathy with\r\nwhat would now be called popular government. His point of view was\r\nessentially aristocratic, and he frankly avowed it.\r\n\r\nHe recognized the fact that under the existing social organization the\r\ninterests of all classes are not the same; that there is a continual\r\nstruggle between them; and that any interest or combination of interests\r\nobtaining control of the government will seek their own welfare at the\r\nexpense of the rest. This, he claimed, made it necessary to so organize\r\nthe government as to give the minority the means of self-protection. To\r\ngive to the minority this constitutional power would tend to prevent the\r\nselfish struggle to obtain possession of the government, since it would\r\ndeprive the majority of all power to aggrandize themselves at the\r\nexpense of the minority. The very essence of constitutional government,\r\naccording to his view, was the protection afforded to the minority\r\nthrough the limitation of the power of the majority. To accomplish the\r\ntrue end of constitutional government, which is the limitation of the\r\npower of the numerical majority, it is necessary, he contended, that the\r\nvarious classes or interests should be separately represented, and that\r\neach through its proper organ should have a veto on the acts of the\r\nothers. In a government so organized no measure could be enacted into\r\nlaw and no policy enforced, unless it had received the assent of each\r\nelement recognized in the Constitution. This method of taking the sense\r\nof the community, which required the concurrence of its several parts,\r\nhe termed that of the concurrent majority.\r\n\r\nThis principle of class representation, he maintained, was fundamental\r\nin the American Constitution, which recognized for certain purposes the\r\nnumerical majority as one of its elements, but only for certain\r\npurposes. For he tells us, and correctly, that \"the numerical majority\r\nis, strictly speaking, excluded, even as one of its elements.\"[139] In\r\nsupport of this statement he undertakes to show that the numerical\r\nmajority could not even prevent the amendment of the Constitution, since\r\nthrough a combination of the smaller states an amendment desired by the\r\nminority could be forced through in opposition to the wishes of the\r\nmajority. He might have added that it was the intention of those who\r\nframed our government to allow the minority a free hand in amending by\r\nthe method of constitutional interpretation; and also that they intended\r\nto deny to the numerical majority a veto on treaties and appointments.\r\nThis refusal to recognize the numerical majority even as one of the\r\ncoordinate elements in the government was as hereinbefore shown\r\ninconsistent with the doctrine of checks, and is to be explained on the\r\ntheory that they wished to subordinate the democratic element in the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nCalhoun argued that the growth of political parties had broken down our\r\nsystem of constitutional checks. The Constitution as originally adopted\r\nmade no mention of, and allowed no place for these voluntary political\r\norganizations. In fact, the purpose of the political party was\r\ndiametrically opposed to and subversive of all that was fundamental in\r\nthe Constitution itself, since it aimed at nothing less than the\r\ncomplete destruction of the system of checks by bringing every branch of\r\nthe government under its control. To the extent that it had achieved its\r\npurpose, it had consolidated the powers of the general government and\r\nbrought them, he contended, under the direct control of the numerical\r\nmajority, which was the very thing that the framers of the Constitution\r\nwished to guard against.\r\n\r\nThe complete control which the numerical majority had thus obtained over\r\nthe Federal government made it supremely important that all\r\nconstitutional power vested in the several states to resist Federal\r\naggression should be actively employed. That the states had the power\r\nunder the Constitution to check the general government when it attempted\r\nto overstep the limits set to its authority was necessarily implied in\r\nthe fact that our system of government was federal and not national.\r\nHis argument proceeded on the theory encouraged by the framers of the\r\nConstitution that the general government and the state governments were\r\ncoordinate. \"The idea of coordinates,\" he tells us, \"excludes that of\r\nsuperior and subordinate, and necessarily implies that of equality. But\r\nto give either the right, not only to judge of the extent of its own\r\npowers, but, also, of that of its coordinate, and to enforce its\r\ndecision against it, would be, not only to destroy the equality between\r\nthem, but to deprive one of an attribute--appertaining to all\r\ngovernments--to judge, in the first instance, of the extent of its\r\npowers. The effect would be to raise one from an equal to a superior,\r\nand to reduce the other from an equal to a subordinate.\"[140]\r\n\r\nFrom this it would follow that neither should have the exclusive right\r\nto judge of its own powers--that each should have a negative on the acts\r\nof the others. That this was the intention of the framers of the\r\nConstitution he argues from the fact that all efforts in the Convention\r\nto give the general government a negative on the acts of the states were\r\nunsuccessful. The efforts to confer this power, he contends, were made\r\nbecause it was seen that in the absence of such a provision the states\r\nwould have a negative on the acts of the general government. The failure\r\nof these efforts in the Convention was due, he claims, to the fact that\r\nthe members of that body wished to make the general government and the\r\nstate governments coordinate, instead of subordinating the latter to the\r\nformer as the advocates of a national government desired. The fact upon\r\nwhich Calhoun based this contention would seem to justify his\r\nconclusion; but if we consult the debates which took place in that body,\r\nit is easily seen that the refusal of the Convention to incorporate such\r\na provision in the Constitution can not be ascribed to any hostility on\r\nthe part of that body to national government. In fact, as hereinbefore\r\nshown, it was for purely practical reasons that they rejected all\r\nproposals which contemplated the recognition in the Constitution itself\r\nof the supremacy of the general government. While declining to allow a\r\nprovision of this character to be incorporated in the Constitution, they\r\nby no means disapproved of a strong supreme central government, but\r\nmerely adopted a less direct and therefore easier method of attaining\r\ntheir end.\r\n\r\nWhile Calhoun maintained that in order to make the limitations on the\r\nauthority of the general government effective it was necessary that a\r\nstate should have a veto on Federal laws, he did not contend that the\r\nverdict of a state should be final. It would still be possible for the\r\ngeneral government to override the veto of a state by procuring a\r\nconstitutional amendment which would remove all doubt as to its right to\r\nexercise the power in question. This method of appeal, he argued, was\r\nalways open to the general government, since it represented and was in\r\nthe hands of the numerical majority. This would be true, however, only\r\nwhen the party in power had the requisite two-thirds majority in both\r\nhouses of Congress, or at least controlled the legislatures in\r\ntwo-thirds of the states. Otherwise its control of the general\r\ngovernment would not enable it to propose the desired constitutional\r\namendment. With this qualification Calhoun's contention was correct. On\r\nthe other hand the state could not defend itself against Federal\r\naggression, since, belonging to the minority, it would have no means of\r\ncompelling the submission of a constitutional amendment involving the\r\npoint in dispute. The effect of a state veto on an act of Congress would\r\nbe to compel the latter to choose between abandoning the law in question\r\nas unconstitutional and appealing to the constitution-making power in\r\ndefense of its claim. If it chose the latter alternative and succeeded\r\nin having its authority supported by an appropriate constitutional\r\namendment, there was nothing for the state to do but submit, provided\r\nthat the amendment in question was one clearly within the scope of the\r\namending power. If, as Calhoun assumed, it was the purpose of the\r\nConstitution to withhold from a mere majority in control of the general\r\ngovernment the power to enact and enforce unconstitutional legislation,\r\nthe veto of a state would seem to be the only means by which the\r\nconstitutional rights of a minority of the states could be protected.\r\n\r\nCalhoun did not question the right of the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates to declare an act of Congress null and void, or its right to pass\r\njudgment upon the Constitution or the laws of a state when they were\r\nattacked as in conflict with the Federal Constitution in a case before\r\nit. This right, he contended, belonged to all courts whether federal or\r\nstate. A decision of the Supreme Court of the United States adverse to\r\nthe constitution or law of a state was, however, he maintained, binding\r\nonly on the general government itself and the parties to the suit. As\r\nagainst the state it had no power to enforce its decision.\r\n\r\nHis entire argument rests upon the assumption that the Federal and state\r\ngovernments are co-equal and not superior and subordinate. This line of\r\nargument naturally led to the conclusion that the Federal and state\r\ncourts were coordinate. It was perfectly natural for the advocate of\r\nstate rights to take this view of the matter. Moreover there was nothing\r\nin the Constitution which expressly contradicted it. The framers of that\r\ninstrument, as hereinbefore shown, did not wish to make an open attack\r\non the generally accepted doctrine of state sovereignty before the\r\nConstitution was adopted. Their purpose was fully disclosed only after\r\nthey had obtained control of the new government under the Constitution.\r\nTo carry out their plan of subordinating the states, it was necessary to\r\nestablish the supremacy of the Federal judiciary. This was accomplished\r\nby an act of Congress[141] which provided that \"a final judgment or\r\ndecree in any suit in the highest court ... of a state in which a\r\ndecision in the suit could be had, where is drawn in question the\r\nvalidity of a treaty or statute of, or an authority exercised under, the\r\nUnited States, and the decision is against their validity; or where is\r\ndrawn in question the validity of a statute of, or an authority\r\nexercised under, any state, on the ground of their being repugnant to\r\nthe Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United States, and the\r\ndecision is in favor of their validity; or where is drawn in question\r\nthe construction ... of a treaty, or statute of, or commission held\r\nunder, the United States, and the decision is against the title, right,\r\nprivilege, or exemption specially set up or claimed by either party,\r\nunder such clause of said Constitution, treaty, statute, or Commission,\r\nmay be re-examined, and reversed or affirmed in the Supreme Court of the\r\nUnited States upon a writ of error.\"\r\n\r\nThis act, while expressly conferring upon the Supreme Court of the\r\nUnited States the power to veto a state law, at the same time denied to\r\na state court the right to treat as unconstitutional a statute, treaty,\r\nor authority exercised under the general government. The question might\r\nproperly be asked why this provision was not incorporated in the\r\nConstitution itself. Why did not the framers of that document clearly\r\ndefine the relation of the Federal to the state courts? To have included\r\nthe substance of this act in the Constitution as submitted to the\r\nstates, would have precluded the possibility of any future controversy\r\nconcerning the relation of the Federal to the state courts. From the\r\npoint of view of practical politics, however, there was one unanswerable\r\nargument against this plan. It would have clearly indicated the\r\nintention of the framers of the Constitution, but in doing so, it would\r\nfor that very reason have aroused opposition which it would have been\r\nimpossible to overcome. This is why the matter of defining the relation\r\nof the Federal to the state courts was deferred until after the\r\nConstitution had been ratified by the states. They chose the only\r\npracticable means of accomplishing their purpose. With all branches of\r\nthe Federal government under their control, they were able to enact a\r\nlaw which virtually amended the Constitution. Calhoun argues that in\r\npassing this act Congress exceeded the powers granted to it by the\r\nConstitution. What he fails to recognize, however, is the fact that this\r\nmeasure, although at variance with the interpretation placed upon the\r\nConstitution by the people generally, was, nevertheless, in entire\r\nharmony with the general purpose of its framers and necessary to carry\r\nthat purpose into effect.\r\n\r\nThe view of the American Constitution herein presented may not be\r\nfamiliar to the average reader of our political literature. For\r\nnotwithstanding the overwhelming proof of the aristocratic origin of our\r\nconstitutional arrangements accessible to the unbiassed student, the\r\nnotion has been sedulously cultivated that our general government was\r\nbased on the theory of majority rule. Unfounded as an analysis of our\r\npolitical institutions shows this belief to be, it has by dint of\r\nconstant repetition come to be widely accepted. It is beyond question\r\nthat the Constitution was not so regarded by the people at the beginning\r\nof our national life. How, then, was this change in the attitude of the\r\npublic brought about? There has doubtless been more than one influence\r\nthat has contributed to this result. The abundant natural resources of\r\nthe country and the material prosperity of the people are a factor that\r\ncannot be ignored. To these must in a measure be ascribed the uncritical\r\nattitude of mind, the prevailing indifference to political conditions,\r\nand the almost universal optimism which have characterized the American\r\npeople. This lack of general attention to and interest in the more\r\nserious and profound questions of government has been favorable to the\r\ninculcation and acceptance of ideas of the system utterly at variance\r\nwith its true character. Still, with all due allowance for these\r\nfavoring conditions, it is hard to find a satisfactory explanation of\r\nthe process by which the worshipers of democracy came to deify an\r\nundemocratic constitution. The desire of the conservative classes to\r\npreserve and perpetuate the system by presenting it in the guise of\r\ndemocracy, and their influence upon the political thought of the people\r\ngenerally must be regarded as the chief factor in bringing about this\r\nextraordinary change in public opinion. Hostile criticism of the\r\nConstitution soon \"gave place to an undiscriminating and almost blind\r\nworship of its principles ... and criticism was estopped.... The divine\r\nright of kings never ran a more prosperous course than did this\r\nunquestioned prerogative of the Constitution to receive universal\r\nhomage. The conviction that our institutions were the best in the world,\r\nnay more, the model to which all civilized states must sooner or later\r\nconform, could not be laughed out of us by foreign critics, nor shaken\r\nout of us by the roughest jars of the system.\"[142]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nUNDEMOCRATIC DEVELOPMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been shown that the main purpose of the Constitution was to limit\r\nthe power of the people. The recognition of this fact enables us to\r\nunderstand much of the subsequent development of our political\r\ninstitutions--a development for which the generally accepted theory of\r\nour system affords no adequate explanation. The erroneous view of the\r\nConstitution so generally inculcated has thus far misled the public as\r\nto the true source of our political evils. It would indeed be strange if\r\nsome of the abuses incident to every form of minority rule had not made\r\ntheir appearance under the operation of a system such as has been\r\ndescribed. Where the influence of public opinion has been so restricted,\r\nit would be but reasonable to expect that the practical working of the\r\ngovernment would reflect something of the spirit of the Constitution\r\nitself. As a consequence of these limitations originally placed upon the\r\npower of the people, the development of our system has not been wholly\r\nin the direction of democracy. The constitutional authority conferred\r\nupon the minority has exerted a far-reaching influence upon the growth\r\nof our political institutions. The natural effect of subordinating the\r\ndemocratic element would be to render its influence more feeble as the\r\nsystem developed. That this has not been a purely imaginary danger may\r\nbe easily shown.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution expressly gave to the qualified voters of the various\r\nstates the right to control the House of Representatives. It was because\r\nof this fact, as explained in the preceding chapter, that this body was\r\nsubordinated in our scheme of government. Even the most perfect control\r\nover this branch would have given the people no positive control over\r\nthe government as a whole. At the most, it conceded to them merely a\r\nnegative on a part of the acts and policy of the government. Yet popular\r\ncontrol over this branch of the government has become less and less\r\neffective as our political system has developed.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution provides that \"the times, places, and manner of holding\r\nelections for senators and representatives shall be prescribed in each\r\nstate by the legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by\r\nlaw make or alter such regulations, except as to the place of choosing\r\nsenators.\"[143]\r\n\r\nIt also provides that \"Congress shall assemble at least once in every\r\nyear, and such meeting shall be on the first Monday in December, unless\r\nthey shall by law appoint a different day.\"\r\n\r\nIt also requires that the members of the House of Representatives shall\r\nbe elected every second year; but as originally adopted it does not\r\nspecify when their term of office shall begin.\r\n\r\nAfter the ratification of the Constitution the Congress of the\r\nConfederation on September 13, 1788, designated March 4, 1789, as the\r\ntime for commencing proceedings under the new régime. This made the term\r\nof office of President, Senators, and Representatives begin on that\r\ndate.\r\n\r\nAn act of Congress, March 1, 1792, provided that the term of office of\r\nPresident should \"in all cases, commence on the fourth day of March next\r\nsucceeding the day on which the votes of the electors shall have been\r\ngiven.\"\r\n\r\nThis date was recognized as the beginning of the President's term of\r\noffice by the Twelfth Amendment to the Constitution, which went into\r\neffect in 1804. By implication this amendment makes the term of\r\nrepresentatives begin on the fourth of March of each odd year.\r\n\r\nCongress, exercising the power vested in it by the Constitution to\r\nregulate Federal elections, enacted a law bearing date of February 2,\r\n1872, which requires the election of representatives to be held on the\r\nTuesday next after the first Monday in November of each even year,\r\nbeginning with the year 1876. By act of March 3, 1875, this was modified\r\nso as not to apply to any state whose constitution would have to be\r\namended before the day fixed for electing state officers could be\r\nchanged in conformity with this provision.[144]\r\n\r\nCongress has no power to change the date on which the term of office of\r\na representative begins; but it does have authority to change the time\r\nof electing the House of Representatives, and also to determine when its\r\nown sessions shall begin, subject to the constitutional limitation that\r\nit shall meet at least once each year.\r\n\r\nUnder the law as it now stands the members of a newly elected House of\r\nRepresentatives do not meet in regular session until thirteen months\r\nafter their election. Moreover, the second regular session does not\r\nbegin until after the succeeding Congress has been elected.\r\n\r\nThe evils of this arrangement are thus described by a member of the\r\nHouse:\r\n\r\n\"The lower branch of Congress should at the earliest practicable time\r\nenact the principles of the majority of the people as expressed in the\r\nelection of each Congress. That is why the Constitution requires the\r\nelection of a new Congress every two years. If it were not to reflect\r\nthe sentiments of the people then frequent elections would have no\r\nmeaning or purpose. Any evasion of that rule is subversive of the\r\nfundamental principle of our government that the majority shall rule.\r\nNo other government in the world has its legislative body convene so\r\nlong after the expression of the people....\r\n\r\n\"As an election often changes the political complexion of a Congress,\r\nunder the present law, many times we have the injustice of a Congress\r\nthat has been repudiated by the people enacting laws for the people\r\ndiametrically opposed to the last expression of the people. Such a\r\ncondition is an outrage on the rights of the majority....\r\n\r\n\"Under the present law a representative in Congress who has been turned\r\ndown by the people legislates for that people in the second regular\r\nsession....\r\n\r\n\"A man who has been defeated for re-election is not in a fit frame of\r\nmind to legislate for his people. There is a sting in defeat that tends\r\nto engender the feeling of resentment which often finds expression in\r\nthe vote of such members against wholesome legislation. That same\r\nfeeling often produces such a want of interest in proceedings as to\r\ncause the members to be absent nearly all the second session....\r\n\r\n\"It is then that some are open to propositions which they would never\r\nthink of entertaining if they were to go before the people for\r\nre-election. It is then that the attorneyship of some corporation is\r\noften tendered and a vote is afterward found in the record in favor of\r\nlegislation of a general or special character favoring the\r\ncorporation.\"[145]\r\n\r\nTo appreciate the magnitude of the evils above described, it is\r\nnecessary to remember that upon the average only about one-half of the\r\nmembers of one Congress are elected to the succeeding Congress. This\r\nlarge number is, therefore, influenced during the second regular session\r\nneither by the hope of re-election nor the fear of defeat. Under these\r\ncircumstances it is not surprising that the second regular session\r\nshould be notoriously favorable to corporation measures.\r\n\r\nThat Congress has not attempted to remedy this evil is striking proof of\r\nits indifference to the wishes of the people. Otherwise it would have so\r\nemployed the power which it possesses to perfect its organization, as to\r\nensure the most prompt and complete expression of public opinion in\r\nlegislation possible under our constitutional arrangements. Having the\r\npower to change both the time of electing a Congress and the beginning\r\nof its sessions, it could easily remedy the evils described. Both\r\nsessions of a Congress could be held before the succeeding Congress is\r\nelected. This could be accomplished by having Congress convene, as\r\nadvocated by the writer of the article above mentioned, for the first\r\nregular session on the Monday following the fourth of March next after\r\nthe election, and for the second regular session on the first Monday\r\nafter January first of the following year. In this case the second\r\nregular session would doubtless come to an end before the fall election.\r\nSome such adjustment is required to give the people anything like\r\nadequate control over the House of Representatives during the second\r\nregular session.\r\n\r\nThe present arrangement which makes the House of Representatives largely\r\nan irresponsible body, while not provided for or perhaps even\r\ncontemplated by the framers of the Constitution, is nevertheless the\r\nlogical outcome of their plan to throttle the power of the majority. But\r\nalthough in harmony with the general purpose and spirit of the\r\nConstitution, it is a flagrant violation of the basic principle of\r\npopular government.[146]\r\n\r\nThis tendency may be still more clearly seen in the growth of the\r\ncommittee system by which the division of power and its consequence,\r\npolitical irresponsibility, have been carried much farther than the\r\nConstitution contemplated, especially in the organization of the House,\r\nof Representatives. No standing committees were provided for by the\r\nConstitution and few were established by the House during the early\r\nyears of its existence. The system once introduced, however, has\r\ngradually developed until the House now has more than fifty-five of\r\nthese committees.\r\n\r\nEvery legislative proposal must under the rules after its second reading\r\nbe referred to the committee having jurisdiction over that particular\r\nbranch of legislation. Theoretically, any member has a right to\r\nintroduce any bill whatever. But as it must be referred to the proper\r\ncommittee and be reported by it to the House before the latter can\r\ndiscuss and adopt or reject it, it is evident that the right to initiate\r\nlegislation has in effect been taken from the individual members and\r\nvested in the various standing committees. Under this method of\r\nprocedure no proposed legislation can be enacted by the House without\r\nthe consent of the committee having that particular branch of\r\nlegislation in charge. The fact that a measure must be referred to a\r\ncommittee does not imply that that committee is obliged to report it\r\nback to the House. This the committee will, of course, do if the\r\nproposed bill is one which it wishes to have passed. But if it views the\r\nproposed legislation with disfavor, it may revise it so as to make it\r\nconform to its own wishes, or it may report it so late in the session as\r\nto prevent its consideration by the House, or it may neglect to report\r\nit altogether. This virtually gives a small body of men constituting a\r\ncommittee a veto on every legislative proposal. The extent to which this\r\nsystem diminishes the responsibility of the House can not be fully\r\nappreciated without bearing in mind the manner of appointment and\r\ncomposition of the committees. The Constitution provides that \"the House\r\nof Representatives shall choose their speaker and other officers,\"[147]\r\nbut it makes no mention of the speaker's powers. The right to appoint\r\nthe committees is not conferred on the speaker by the Constitution. The\r\nextent and character of the powers exercised by that official are\r\ndetermined very largely by the rules and usages of the House. This is\r\nthe source of his power to appoint the chairman and other members of the\r\nvarious standing committees.\r\n\r\nThe speaker is elected at the beginning of each Congress and retains his\r\noffice during the life of that body. The same is now true of the\r\nstanding committees which he appoints, though previous to 1861 they were\r\nappointed for the session only.\r\n\r\nThe speaker is, of course, a member of the dominant party in the House,\r\nand is expected to use the powers and prerogatives of his office to\r\nadvance in all reasonable ways the interests of the party which he\r\nrepresents. The selection of committees which he makes is naturally\r\nenough influenced by various considerations of a political and personal\r\nnature. It is largely determined by the influences to which he owes his\r\nelevation to the speakership. In return for the support of influential\r\nmembers in his own party certain important chairmanships have been\r\npromised in advance. And even where no definite pledges have been made\r\nhe must use the appointive power in a manner that will be acceptable to\r\nhis party. This does not always prevent him, however, from exercising\r\nenough freedom in making up the committees to insure him a large measure\r\nof control over legislation.\r\n\r\nAll the chairmanships and a majority of the places on each committee are\r\ngiven to the members of his own party. As the speaker's right to appoint\r\ndoes not carry with it the power to remove, he has no control over a\r\ncommittee after it is appointed. The committees, as a matter of fact,\r\nare in no true sense responsible either to the speaker or to the House\r\nitself, since once appointed they can do as they please. They are in\r\nfact just so many small, independent, irresponsible bodies, each\r\ncontrolling in its own way and from motives known only to itself the\r\nparticular branch of legislation assigned to it. The only semblance of\r\nresponsibility attaching to the committee is found in the party\r\naffiliation of the majority of its members with the majority in the\r\nHouse. But ineffectual and intangible as this is, it is rendered even\r\nmore so by the fact that the opposition party is also represented on\r\neach committee. This allows the dominant party to escape\r\nresponsibility, since it can claim that its failure to satisfy the\r\npopular demand has been due to the opposition of the minority in the\r\nvarious committees, which has made concession and compromise necessary.\r\n\r\n\"The deliberations of committees,\" as Bryce says, \"are usually secret.\r\nEvidence is frequently taken with open doors, but the newspapers do not\r\nreport it, unless the matter excite public interest; and even the\r\ndecisions arrived at are often noticed in the briefest way. It is out of\r\norder to canvass the proceedings of a committee in the House until they\r\nhave been formally reported to it; and the report submitted does not\r\nusually state how the members have voted, or contain more than a very\r\ncurt outline of what has passed. No member speaking in the House is\r\nentitled to reveal anything further.\"[148]\r\n\r\nA system better adapted to the purposes of the lobbyist could not be\r\ndevised. \"It gives facilities for the exercise of underhand and even\r\ncorrupt influence. In a small committee the voice of each member is well\r\nworth securing, and may be secured with little danger of a public\r\nscandal. The press can not, even when the doors of committee rooms stand\r\nopen, report the proceedings of fifty bodies; the eye of the nation can\r\nnot follow and mark what goes on within them; while the subsequent\r\nproceedings in the House are too hurried to permit a ripping up there\r\nof suspicious bargains struck in the purlieus of the Capital, and\r\nfulfilled by votes given in a committee.\"[149]\r\n\r\nA system which puts the power to control legislation in the hands of\r\nthese small independent bodies and at the same time shields them so\r\nlargely against publicity affords ample opportunity for railway and\r\nother corporate interests to exercise a controlling influence upon\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\nThis subdivision of the legislative power of the House and its\r\ndistribution among many small, irresponsible bodies precludes the\r\npossibility of any effective party control over legislation. And since\r\nthe majority in the House can not control its own agents there can be no\r\neffective party responsibility. To ensure responsibility the party in\r\nthe majority must act as a unit and be opposed by an active and united\r\nminority. But our committee system disintegrates both the majority and\r\nthe minority.\r\n\r\nAnother practice which has augmented the authority and at the same time\r\ndiminished the responsibility of the committees is the hurried manner in\r\nwhich the House disposes of the various measures that come before it.\r\nThe late Senator Hoar has estimated that the entire time which the House\r\nallows for this purpose during the two sessions which make up the life\r\nof a Congress \"gives an average of no more than two hours apiece to the\r\ncommittees of the House to report upon, debate, and dispose of all the\r\nsubjects of general legislation committed to their charge. From this\r\ntime is taken the time consumed in reading the bill, and in calling the\r\nyeas and nays, which may be ordered by one-fifth of the members present,\r\nand which require forty minutes for a single roll-call.\"[150]\r\n\r\nMoreover, the member \"who reports the bill dictates how long the debate\r\nshall last, who shall speak on each side, and whether any and what\r\namendments shall be offered. Any member fit to be intrusted with the\r\ncharge of an important measure would be deemed guilty of an inexcusable\r\nblunder if he surrendered the floor which the usages of the House assign\r\nto his control for an hour, without demanding the previous\r\nquestion.\"[151]\r\n\r\nNothing more would seem to be necessary to give the committee control of\r\nthe situation. True the House may reject the bill which it submits, but\r\nthe committee may easily prevent the House from voting upon a measure\r\nwhich a majority of that body desires to enact.\r\n\r\nAs there are many committees and the time which the House can give to\r\nthe consideration of their reports is limited, it naturally follows that\r\neach committee is anxious to get all other business out of the way in\r\norder that it may have an opportunity to bring the measures which it\r\nhas prepared to the attention of the House. This struggle between the\r\nvarious committees for an opportunity to report the bills which they\r\nhave framed and have them considered by the House explains the\r\nacquiescence of that body in a system that so greatly restricts the\r\nfreedom of debate. Very rarely will a committee encounter any formidable\r\nopposition in bringing the discussion of its measures to a close.\r\n\r\nThe speaker's power of recognition is another check upon the majority in\r\nthe House. This power which he freely uses in an arbitrary manner\r\nenables him to prevent the introduction of an obnoxious bill by refusing\r\nto recognize a member who wishes to obtain the floor for that\r\npurpose.[152] Moreover, as chairman of the Committee on Rules he\r\nvirtually has the power to determine the order in which the various\r\nmeasures shall be considered by the House. In this way he can secure an\r\nopportunity for those bills which he wishes the House to pass and ensure\r\nthe defeat of those to which he is opposed by giving so many other\r\nmatters the preference that they can not be reached before the close of\r\nthe second session.\r\n\r\nThe power thus exercised by the speaker, coupled with that of the\r\ncommittees, imposes an effectual restraint not only on the individual\r\nmembers, but on the majority as well. A large majority of the bills\r\nintroduced are vetoed by the committees or \"killed\" by simply not\r\nreporting them back to the House. There is no way in which the House can\r\noverride the veto of a committee or that of the speaker, since even when\r\nthe rules are suspended no measure can be considered that has not been\r\npreviously reported by a committee, while the speaker can enforce his\r\nveto through his power of recognition. Both the committees and the\r\nspeaker have what is for all practical purposes an absolute veto on\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\nA motion to suspend the rules and pass any bill that has been reported\r\nto the House may be made on the first and third Mondays of each month or\r\nduring the last six days of each session. \"In this way, if two-thirds of\r\nthe body agree, a bill is by a single vote, without discussion and\r\nwithout change, passed through all the necessary stages, and made law so\r\nfar as the consent of the House can accomplish it. And in this mode\r\nhundreds of measures of vital importance receive, near the close of\r\nexhausting sessions, without being debated, amended, printed, or\r\nunderstood, the constitutional assent of the representatives of the\r\nAmerican people.\"[153]\r\n\r\nThis system which so effectually restricts the power of the majority in\r\nthe House affords no safeguard against local or class legislation. By\r\nmaking it difficult for any bill however worthy of consideration to\r\nreceive a hearing on its own merits, it naturally leads to the practice\r\nknown as log-rolling. The advocates of a particular measure may find\r\nthat it can not be passed unless they agree to support various other\r\nmeasures of which they disapprove. It thus happens that many of the\r\nbills passed by the House are the result of this bargaining between the\r\nsupporters of various measures. Certain members in order to secure the\r\npassage of a bill in which they are especially interested will support\r\nand vote for other bills which they would prefer to vote against. In\r\nthis way many bills secure a favorable vote in the House when a majority\r\nof that body are really opposed to their enactment. It is entirely\r\nwithin the bounds of possibility that no important measure desired by\r\nthe people at large and which would be supported by a majority of the\r\nHouse, can be passed, since any powerful private interest opposed to\r\nsuch legislation may be able to have the measure in question quietly\r\nkilled in committee or otherwise prevented from coming to a final vote\r\nin the House. But while legislation in the interest of the people\r\ngenerally may be defeated through the silent but effective opposition of\r\npowerful private interests, many other measures which ought to be\r\ndefeated are allowed to pass. A system which makes it possible to defeat\r\nthe will of the majority in the House by preventing on the one hand the\r\nenactment of laws which that majority favors, and by permitting on the\r\nother hand the enactment of laws to which it is opposed, certainly does\r\nnot allow public opinion to exercise an effective control over the\r\nproceedings of the House.\r\n\r\nAs a foreign critic observes, \"the House has ceased to be a debating\r\nassembly: it is only an instrument for hasty voting on the proposals\r\nwhich fifty small committees have prepared behind closed doors.... At\r\nthe present time it is very much farther from representing the people\r\nthan if, instead of going as far as universal suffrage, it had kept to\r\nan infinitely narrower franchise, but had preserved at the same time the\r\nfreedom, fullness, and majesty of its debates.\"[154]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE PARTY SYSTEM\r\n\r\n\r\nThe political party is a voluntary association which seeks to enlist a\r\nmajority of voters under its banner and thereby gain control of the\r\ngovernment. As the means employed by the majority to make its will\r\neffective, it is irreconcilably opposed to all restraints upon its\r\nauthority. Party government in this sense is the outcome of the efforts\r\nof the masses to establish their complete and untrammeled control of the\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nThis is the reason why conservative statesmen of the eighteenth century\r\nregarded the tendency towards party government as the greatest political\r\nevil of the time. Far-sighted men saw clearly that its purpose was\r\nrevolutionary; that if accomplished, monarchy and aristocracy would be\r\nshorn of all power; that the checks upon the masses would be swept away\r\nand the popular element made supreme. This would lead inevitably to the\r\noverthrow of the entire system of special privilege which centuries of\r\nclass rule had carefully built up and protected.\r\n\r\nWhen our Constitution was framed responsible party government had not\r\nbeen established in England. In theory the Constitution of Great\r\nBritain recognized three coordinate powers, the King, the Lords, and the\r\nCommons. But as a matter of fact the government of England was\r\npredominantly aristocratic. The landed interests exerted a controlling\r\ninfluence even in the House of Commons. The rapidly growing importance\r\nof capital had not yet seriously impaired the constitutional authority\r\nof the landlord class. Land had been until recently the only important\r\nform of wealth; and the right to a voice in the management of the\r\ngovernment was still an incident of land ownership. Men as such were not\r\nentitled to representation. The property-owning classes made the laws\r\nand administered them, officered the army and navy, and controlled the\r\npolicy of the government in every direction.\r\n\r\n\"According to a table prepared about 1815, the House of Commons\r\ncontained 471 members who owed their seats to the goodwill and pleasure\r\nof 144 Peers and 123 Commoners, 16 government nominees, and only 171\r\nmembers elected by popular suffrages.\"[155]\r\n\r\nAs the real power behind the government was the aristocracy of wealth,\r\nthe English system, though nominally one of checks and balances, closely\r\nresembled in its practical working an unlimited aristocracy.\r\n\r\nThe framers of our Constitution, as shown in previous chapters, took the\r\nEnglish government for their model and sought to establish the supremacy\r\nof the well-to-do classes. Like the English conservatives of that time\r\nthey deplored the existence of political parties and consequently made\r\nno provision for them in the system which they established. Indeed,\r\ntheir chief purpose was to prevent the very thing which the responsible\r\npolitical party aimed to establish, viz., majority rule.\r\n\r\n\"Among the numerous advantages promised by a well-constructed union,\"\r\nwrote Madison in defense of the Constitution, \"none deserves to be more\r\naccurately developed than its tendency to break and control the violence\r\nof faction....\r\n\r\n\"By a faction, I understand a number of citizens, whether amounting to a\r\nmajority or minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some\r\ncommon impulse of passion, or of interest, adverse to the rights of\r\nother citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the\r\ncommunity....\r\n\r\n\" ... But the most common and durable source of factions has been the\r\nvarious and unequal distribution of property. Those who hold and those\r\nwho are without property have ever formed distinct interests in society.\r\nThose who are creditors, and those who are debtors, fall under a like\r\ndiscrimination. A landed interest, a manufacturing interest, a\r\nmercantile interest, a moneyed interest, with many lesser interests,\r\ngrow up of necessity in civilized nations, and divide them into\r\ndifferent classes actuated by different sentiments and views....\r\n\r\n\"If a faction consists of less than a majority, relief is supplied by\r\nthe republican principle, which enables the majority to defeat its\r\nsinister views by a regular vote. It may clog the administration, it may\r\nconvulse the society; but it will be unable to execute and mask its\r\nviolence under the forms of the Constitution. When a majority is\r\nincluded in a faction, the form of popular government, on the other\r\nhand, enables it to sacrifice to its ruling passion or interest both the\r\npublic good and the rights of other citizens. To secure the public good\r\nand private rights against the danger of such a faction, and at the same\r\ntime to preserve the spirit and the form of popular government, is then\r\nthe great object to which our inquiries are directed.\"[156]\r\n\r\nThe very existence of political parties would endanger the system which\r\nthey set up, since in their efforts to strengthen and perpetuate their\r\nrule they would inevitably advocate extensions of the suffrage, and thus\r\nin the end competition between parties for popular support would be\r\ndestructive of all those property qualifications for voting and holding\r\noffice which had up to that time excluded the propertyless classes from\r\nany participation in public affairs. Hence Washington though a staunch\r\nFederalist himself saw nothing inconsistent in trying to blend the\r\nextremes of political opinion by giving both Hamilton and Jefferson a\r\nplace in his Cabinet.\r\n\r\nIn England the party by the Reform bill of 1832 accomplished its\r\npurpose, broke through the barriers erected against it, divested the\r\nCrown of all real authority, subordinated the House of Lords, and\r\nestablished the undisputed rule of the majority in the House of Commons.\r\nThis accomplished, it was inevitable that the rivalry between political\r\nparties should result in extensions of the suffrage until the House\r\nshould come to represent, as it does in practice to-day, the sentiment\r\nof the English people.\r\n\r\nThe framers of the American Constitution, however, succeeded in erecting\r\nbarriers which democracy has found it more difficult to overcome. For\r\nmore than a century the constitutional bulwarks which they raised\r\nagainst the rule of the numerical majority have obstructed and retarded\r\nthe progress of the democratic movement. The force of public sentiment\r\nsoon compelled, it is true, the adoption of the Twelfth Amendment, which\r\nin effect recognized the existence of political parties and made\r\nprovision for the party candidate for President and Vice-President. At\r\nmost, however, it merely allowed the party to name the executive\r\nwithout giving it any effective control over him after he was elected,\r\nsince in other respects the general plan of the Constitution remained\r\nunchanged.\r\n\r\nThe political party, it is true, has come to play an important role\r\nunder our constitutional system; but its power and influence are of a\r\nnegative rather than a positive character. It professes, of course, to\r\nstand for the principle of majority rule, but in practice it has become\r\nan additional and one of the most potent checks on the majority.\r\n\r\nTo understand the peculiar features of the American party system one\r\nmust bear in mind the constitutional arrangements under which it has\r\ndeveloped. The party is simply a voluntary political association through\r\nwhich the people seek to formulate the policy of the government, select\r\nthe officials who are to carry it out in the actual administration of\r\npublic affairs, and hold them to strict accountability for so doing.\r\nUnder any government which makes full provision for the political party,\r\nas in the English system of to-day, the party has not only the power to\r\nelect but the power to remove those who are entrusted with the execution\r\nof its policies. Having this complete control of the government, it can\r\nnot escape responsibility for failure to carry out the promises by which\r\nit secured a majority at the polls. This is the essential difference\r\nbetween the English system on the one hand and the party under the\r\nAmerican constitutional system on the other. The one well knows that if\r\nit carries the election it will be expected to make its promises good.\r\nThe other makes certain promises with the knowledge that after the\r\nelection is over it will probably have no power to carry them out.\r\n\r\nIt is this lack of power to shape the entire policy of the government\r\nwhich, more than anything else, has given form and character to the\r\nparty system of the United States. To the extent that the Constitution\r\nhas deprived the majority of the power to mold the policy of the\r\ngovernment through voluntary political associations, it has defeated the\r\nmain purpose for which the party should exist.\r\n\r\nThe fact that under the American form of government the party can not be\r\nheld accountable for failure to carry out its ante-election pledges has\r\nhad the natural and inevitable result. When, as in England, the party\r\nwhich carries the election obtains complete and undisputed control of\r\nthe government, the sense of responsibility is ever present in those who\r\ndirect it. If in the event of its success it is certain to be called\r\nupon to carry out its promises, it can not afford for the sake of\r\nobtaining votes to make promises which it has no intention of keeping.\r\nBut when the party, even though successful at the polls may lack the\r\npower to enforce its policy, it can not be controlled by a sense of\r\ndirect responsibility to the people. Promises may be recklessly and\r\nextravagantly made merely for the sake of getting votes. The party\r\nplatform from the point of view of the party managers ceases to be a\r\nserious declaration of political principles. It comes to be regarded as\r\na means of winning elections rather than a statement of what the party\r\nis obligated to accomplish.\r\n\r\nThe influence thus exerted by the Constitution upon our party system,\r\nthough generally overlooked by students and critics of American\r\npolitics, has had profound and far-reaching results. That the conduct of\r\nindividuals is determined largely by the conditions under which they\r\nlive is as well established as any axiom of political science. This must\r\nbe borne in mind if we would fully understand the prevailing apathy--the\r\nseeming indifference to corruption and ring rule which has so long\r\ncharacterized a large class of intelligent and well-meaning American\r\ncitizens. To ascribe the evils of our party system to their lack of\r\ninterest in public questions and their selfish disregard of civic\r\nduties, is to ignore an important phase of the problem--the influence of\r\nthe system itself. In the long run an active general interest can be\r\nmaintained only in those institutions from which the people derive some\r\nreal or fancied benefit. This benefit in the case of the political party\r\ncan come about only through the control which it enables those who\r\ncompose it to exercise over the government. And where, as under the\r\nAmerican system, control of the party does not ensure control of the\r\ngovernment, the chief motive for an alert and unflagging interest in\r\npolitical questions is lacking. If the majority can not make an\r\neffective use of the party system for the attainment of political ends,\r\nthey can not be expected to maintain an active interest in party\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nBut although our constitutional arrangements are such as to deprive the\r\npeople of effective control over the party, it has offices at its\r\ndisposal and sufficient power to grant or revoke legislative favors to\r\nmake control of its organization a matter of supreme importance to\r\noffice seekers and various corporate interests. Thus while the system\r\ndiscourages an unselfish and public-spirited interest in party politics,\r\nit does appeal directly to those interests which wish to use the party\r\nfor purely selfish ends. Hence the ascendency of the professional\r\npolitician who, claiming to represent the masses, really owes his\r\npreferment to those who subsidize the party machine.\r\n\r\nThe misrepresentative character of the American political party seems to\r\nbe generally recognized by those who have investigated the subject. It\r\nis only when we look for an explanation of this fact that there is much\r\ndifference of opinion. The chief difficulty encountered by those who\r\nhave given attention to this problem has been the point of view from\r\nwhich they have approached it. The unwarranted assumption almost\r\nuniversally made that the principle of majority rule is fundamental in\r\nour scheme of government has been a serious obstacle to any adequate\r\ninvestigation of the question. Blind to the most patent defects of the\r\nConstitution, they have ignored entirely its influence upon the\r\ndevelopment and character of the political party. Taking it for granted\r\nthat our general scheme of government was especially designed to\r\nfacilitate the rule of the majority, they have found it difficult to\r\naccount for the failure of the majority to control the party machine.\r\nWhy is it that under a system which recognizes the right and makes it\r\nthe duty of the majority to control the policy of the government, that\r\ncontrol has in practice passed into the hands of a small minority who\r\nexercise it often in utter disregard of and even in direct opposition to\r\nthe wishes and interests of the majority? On the assumption that we have\r\na Constitution favorable in the highest degree to democracy, how are we\r\nto explain the absence of popular control over the party itself?\r\nIgnoring the obstacles which the Constitution has placed in the way of\r\nmajority rule, American political writers have almost invariably sought\r\nto lay the blame for corruption and machine methods upon the people.\r\nThey would have us believe that if such evils are more pronounced here\r\nthan elsewhere it is because in this country the masses control the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nIf the assumption thus made concerning the nature of our political\r\nsystem were true, we would be forced to accept one of two conclusions:\r\neither that popular government inevitably results in the despotism of a\r\ncorrupt and selfish oligarchy, or if such is not a necessary\r\nconsequence, then at any rate the standard of citizenship in this\r\ncountry intellectually and morally is not high enough to make democracy\r\npracticable. That the ignorance, selfishness and incapacity of the\r\npeople are the real source of the evils mentioned is diligently\r\ninculcated by all those who wish to discredit the theory of popular\r\ngovernment. No one knows better than the machine politician and his\r\nallies in the great corporate industries of the country how little\r\ncontrol the people generally do or can exercise over the party under our\r\npresent political arrangements. To disclose this fact to the people\r\ngenerally, however, might arouse a popular movement of such magnitude as\r\nto sweep away the constitutional checks which are the source of their\r\npower. But as this is the very thing which they wish to prevent, the\r\ndemocratic character of the Constitution must be taken for granted; for\r\nby so doing the people are made to assume the entire responsibility for\r\nthe evils which result from the practical operation of the system. And\r\nsince the alleged democratic character of our political arrangements is,\r\nit is maintained, the real source of the evils complained of, the only\r\neffective remedy would be the restriction of the power of the people.\r\nThis might take the form of additional constitutional checks which would\r\nthereby diminish the influence of a general election upon the policy of\r\nthe government without disturbing the present basis of the suffrage; or\r\nit might be accomplished by excluding from the suffrage those classes\r\ndeemed to be least fit to exercise that right. Either method would still\r\nfurther diminish the influence of the majority, and instead of providing\r\na remedy for the evils of our system, would only intensify them, since\r\nit would augment the power of the minority which is, as we have seen,\r\nthe main source from which they proceed.\r\n\r\nA government which limits the power of the majority might promote the\r\ngeneral interests of society more effectually than one controlled by the\r\nmajority, if the checks were in the hands of a class of superior wisdom\r\nand virtue. But in practice such a government, instead of being better\r\nthan those for whom it exists, is almost invariably worse. The complex\r\nand confusing system of checks, with the consequent diffusion of power\r\nand absence of direct and definite responsibility, is much better\r\nadapted to the purposes of a self-seeking, corrupt minority than to the\r\nends of good government. The evils of such a system which are mainly\r\nthose of minority domination must be carefully distinguished from those\r\nwhich result from majority control. The critics of American political\r\ninstitutions have as a rule ignored the former or constitutional aspect\r\nof our political evils, and have held majority rule accountable for much\r\nthat our system of checks has made the majority powerless to prevent.\r\nThe evils of our party system, having their roots in the lack of popular\r\ncontrol over the party machine, are thus largely a consequence of the\r\nchecks on the power of the majority contained in the Constitution\r\nitself. In other words, they are the outcome, not of too much, but of\r\ntoo little democracy.\r\n\r\nThe advocates of political reform have directed their attention mainly\r\nto the party machine. They have assumed that control of the party\r\norganization by the people would give them control of the government. If\r\nthis view were correct, the evils which exist could be attributed only\r\nto the ignorance, want of public spirit and lack of capacity for\r\neffective political co-operation on the part of the people. But as a\r\nmatter of fact this method of dealing with the problem is open to the\r\nobjection that it mistakes the effect for the cause. It should be\r\nclearly seen that a system of constitutional checks, which hedges about\r\nthe power of the majority on every side, is incompatible with majority\r\nrule; and that even if the majority controlled the party organization,\r\nit could control the policy of the government only by breaking down and\r\nsweeping away the barriers which the Constitution has erected against\r\nit. It follows that all attempts to establish the majority in power by\r\nmerely reforming the party must be futile.\r\n\r\nUnder any political system which recognizes the right of the majority to\r\nrule, responsibility of the government to the people is the end and aim\r\nof all that the party stands for. Party platforms and popular elections\r\nare not ends in themselves, but only means by which the people seek to\r\nmake the government responsive to public opinion. Any arrangement of\r\nconstitutional checks, then, which defeats popular control, strikes down\r\nwhat is most vital and fundamental in party government. And since the\r\nparty under our system can not enforce public opinion, it is but natural\r\nthat the people should lose interest in party affairs. This furnishes an\r\nexplanation of much that is peculiar to the American party system. It\r\naccounts for that seeming indifference and inactivity on the part of the\r\npeople generally, which have allowed a small selfish minority to seize\r\nthe party machinery and use it for private ends.\r\n\r\nThe party, though claiming to represent the people, is not in reality a\r\npopular organ. Its chief object has come to be the perpetuation of\r\nminority control, which makes possible the protection and advancement of\r\nthose powerful private interests to whose co-operation and support the\r\nparty boss is indebted for his continuance in power.[157] To accomplish\r\nthese ends it is necessary to give the party an internal organization\r\nadapted to its real, though not avowed, purpose. The people must not be\r\nallowed to use the party as a means of giving clear and definite\r\nexpression to public opinion concerning the questions wherein the\r\ninterests of the general public are opposed to the various private\r\ninterests which support the party machine. For a strong popular\r\nsentiment well organized and unequivocally expressed could not be\r\nlightly disregarded, even though without constitutional authority to\r\nenforce its decrees. To ensure successful minority rule that minority\r\nmust control those agencies to which the people in all free countries\r\nare accustomed to look for an authoritative expression of the public\r\nwill. The party machine can not serve the purpose of those interests\r\nwhich give it financial support and at the same time allow the people to\r\nnominate its candidates and formulate its political creed. Nevertheless,\r\nthe semblance of popular control must be preserved. The outward\r\nappearance of the party organization, the external forms which catch the\r\npopular eye, must not reveal too clearly the secret methods and\r\ncunningly devised arrangements by which an effective minority control is\r\nmaintained over the nomination of candidates and the framing of party\r\nplatforms. The test of fitness for office is not fidelity to the rank\r\nand file of the people who vote the party ticket, but subserviency to\r\nthose interests which dominate the party machine. The choice of\r\ncandidates is largely made in the secret councils of the ruling minority\r\nand the party conventions under color of making a popular choice of\r\ncandidates merely ratify the minority choice already made. Popular\r\nelections under such a system do not necessarily mean that the people\r\nhave any real power of selecting public officials. They merely have the\r\nprivilege of voting for one or the other of two lists of candidates\r\nneither of which may be in any true sense representative of the people\r\nor their interests.\r\n\r\nBut in nothing is the lack of popular control over the party more\r\nclearly seen than in the party platforms. These are supposed to provide\r\na medium for the expression of public opinion upon the important\r\nquestions with which the government has to deal. Under a political\r\nsystem which recognized the right of the majority to rule, a party\r\nplatform would be constructed with a view to ascertaining the sense of\r\nthat majority. Does the platform of the American political party serve\r\nthis purpose? Does it seek to crystallize and secure a definite\r\nexpression of public opinion at the polls, or is it so constructed as to\r\nprevent it? This question can best be answered by an examination of our\r\nparty platforms.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution, as we have seen, was a reaction against and a\r\nrepudiation of the theory of government expressed in the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, although this fact was persistently denied by those who\r\nframed it and urged its adoption. The high regard in which popular\r\ngovernment was held by the masses did not permit any open and avowed\r\nattempt to discredit it. The democracy of the people, however, was a\r\nmatter of faith rather than knowledge, a mere belief in the right of the\r\nmasses to rule rather than an intelligent appreciation of the political\r\nagencies and constitutional forms through which the ends of popular\r\ngovernment were to be attained. Unless this is borne in mind, it is\r\nimpossible to understand how the Constitution, which was regarded at\r\nfirst with distrust, soon came to be reverenced by the people generally\r\nas the very embodiment of democratic doctrines. In order to bring about\r\nthis change in the attitude of the people, the Constitution was\r\nrepresented by those who sought to advance it in popular esteem as the\r\nembodiment of those principles of popular government to which the\r\nDeclaration of Independence gave expression. The diligence with which\r\nthis view of the Constitution was inculcated by those who were in a\r\nposition to aid in molding public opinion soon secured for it universal\r\nacceptance. Even the political parties which professed to stand for\r\nmajority rule and which should therefore have sought to enlighten the\r\npeople have not only not exposed but actually aided in perpetuating\r\nthis delusion.\r\n\r\nIn the Democratic platform of 1840 we find the following:\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That the liberal principles embodied by Jefferson in the\r\nDeclaration of Independence, and sanctioned in the Constitution, which\r\nmakes ours a land of liberty and the asylum of the oppressed of every\r\nnation, have ever been cardinal principles in the Democratic faith.\"\r\nThis was reaffirmed in the Democratic platforms of 1844, 1848, 1852, and\r\n1856.\r\n\r\nFinding its advocacy of the Declaration of Independence somewhat\r\nembarrassing in view of its attitude on the slavery question, the\r\nDemocratic party omitted from its platform all reference to that\r\ndocument until 1884, when it ventured to reaffirm its faith in the\r\nliberal principles which it embodied. Again, in its platform of 1900, it\r\nreferred to the Declaration of Independence as \"the spirit of our\r\ngovernment\" and the Constitution as its \"form and letter.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Republican platform of 1856 we read \"That the maintenance of the\r\nprinciples promulgated in the Declaration of Independence and embodied\r\nin the Federal Constitution is essential to the preservation of our\r\nrepublican institutions.\" This was repeated in the Republican platform\r\nof 1860, and the principles of the Declaration of Independence alleged\r\nto be embodied in the Constitution were specified, viz., \"That all men\r\nare created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain\r\ninalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit\r\nof happiness; that to secure these rights governments are instituted\r\namong men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.\"\r\nThe authority of the Declaration of Independence was recognized by the\r\nRepublican party in its platform of 1868, and again in its platform of\r\n1876.[158]\r\n\r\nBoth parties have during recent years expressed their disapproval of\r\nmonopolies and trusts, though neither when in power has shown any\r\ndisposition to enact radical anti-monopoly legislation.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic party which favored \"honest money\" in 1880 and 1884 and\r\ndemanded the repeal of the Sherman Act in 1892 stood for free coinage of\r\nsilver at 16 to 1 in 1896 and 1900. The Republican party which advocated\r\ninternational bimetallism in 1884, condemned the Democratic party in\r\n1888 for trying to demonetize silver and endorsed bimetallism in 1892,\r\nfavored \"sound money\" and international bimetallism in 1896 and renewed\r\nits \"allegiance to the principle of the gold standard\" in 1900.\r\n\r\nThe Republican platform of 1860 branded \"the recent reopening of the\r\nAfrican slave trade, under the cover of our national flag, aided by\r\nperversions of judicial power, as a crime against humanity.\" The\r\nDemocratic party in its platform of 1896 expressed its disapproval of\r\nthe Income Tax decision of the United States Supreme Court and in both\r\n1896 and 1900 condemned \"government by injunction.\" With these\r\nexceptions neither party has ever expressed its disapproval of any\r\nexercise of authority by the Federal judiciary.\r\n\r\nNeither of the great parties has ever taken a stand in favor of an\r\nincome tax, government ownership of the railroads or the telegraph, or,\r\nif we except the declaration in favor of direct election of United\r\nStates senators in the Democratic platforms of 1900 and 1904, advocated\r\nany important change in our system of government.\r\n\r\nLet us now inquire how far the results of a general election can be\r\nregarded as an expression of public opinion upon the questions raised in\r\nthe party platforms. Does a popular majority for a party mean that the\r\nmajority approve of the policies for which that party professes to\r\nstand? It is generally assumed by the unthinking that this is the case.\r\nBut such a conclusion by no means follows. If there were but one\r\nquestion at issue between the parties and every vote was for principle,\r\nnot for particular candidates, the policy of the successful party would\r\nhave the approval of the majority. But when the party defines its\r\nposition on a number of issues this is no longer true. Take, for\r\ninstance, the Democratic and Republican platforms of 1900, the former\r\ncontaining twenty-five and the latter twenty-nine separate articles in\r\nits party creed. Does a majority vote for a party indicate that the\r\nmajority approve of the entire platform of that party? No thoughtful\r\nperson would maintain for a moment that all who support a party approve\r\nof its entire platform. In the case of the Republican party in 1900, one\r\nlarge class of its supporters who believed the money question to be\r\nparamount and who feared the consequences of free coinage of silver\r\nvoted the Republican ticket, though opposed to the attitude of that\r\nparty on expansion and also on protection. The ardent protectionist may\r\nhave given the party his support on the strength of its tariff plank\r\nalone. He may even have been opposed to the party's position on the\r\nsilver question and on expansion. Another class who may have disapproved\r\nof both gold monometallism and protection, but who regarded expansion as\r\nthe all-important question, supported the Republican party because of\r\nits attitude in this matter. It is certain that some who voted the\r\nRepublican ticket did not approve its expansion policy; some did not\r\napprove of its extreme protectionist policy; and some did not approve of\r\nits attitude on the money question. Every man who voted the Republican\r\nticket is assumed to have endorsed the entire policy of the party,\r\nthough, as a matter of fact, the party may have secured his vote by\r\nreason of its position on the one question which he deemed to be of\r\nsupreme importance. It is, to say the least, extremely probable that\r\nevery intelligent man who supported the party disapproved of its\r\nattitude on one or more questions. Each plank in the platform was put\r\nthere for the purpose of catching votes. Some gave their vote for one\r\nreason, some for another and some for still other reasons. And when, as\r\nin our present day party platforms, many separate and distinct bids are\r\nmade for votes, it is not only possible but highly probable that no\r\nsingle plank in that party's creed was approved by all who voted the\r\nparty ticket. If the various issues could be segregated and each voted\r\nupon separately, it is conceivable that not one of them would command a\r\nmajority of the entire vote; and yet, by lumping them all together and\r\nskilfully pushing to the front and emphasizing each article of its creed\r\nbefore the class or in the region where it would find most support, the\r\nparty may secure a popular majority for its platform as a whole. Both\r\nparties in their platforms of 1900 stood for the admission as states of\r\nArizona, New Mexico, and Oklahoma; both declared in favor of legislation\r\nagainst monopolies and trusts; both favored liberal pensions, the\r\nconstruction of an Isthmian canal, irrigation of arid lands, reduction\r\nof war taxes and protection of American workmen against cheap foreign\r\nlabor. Yet it does not by any means follow that a majority of the people\r\nvoting really endorsed even these planks which were common to both\r\nplatforms.\r\n\r\nMoreover the party does not always state its position in a clear and\r\nunequivocal manner. The Democratic platform while opposing Republican\r\nexpansion did so with some important reservation. While denouncing the\r\nrecent expansion policy of the Republican party it made a bid for the\r\nsupport of those who believed in a moderate and conservative expansion\r\npolicy. The same is true of its attitude on protection. It did not\r\ncondemn the principle of protection, but merely the abuse of the system\r\nthrough which monopolies and trusts had been fostered. The vague and\r\nambiguous manner in which the party defines its attitude, together with\r\nthe highly composite character of its platform, largely defeats the end\r\nfor which it should be framed. As a means of arriving at a definite and\r\nauthoritative expression of public opinion concerning the political\r\nquestions of the day it is far from satisfactory. It is conceivable that\r\na party may under this system carry an election and yet not a single\r\nprinciple for which it professes to stand would, if separately\r\nsubmitted, command the approval of a majority of the voters.\r\n\r\nThe threefold purpose for which the party exists--(1) popular choice of\r\ncandidates, (2) a clear and definite expression of public opinion\r\nconcerning the questions with which the government must deal, and (3)\r\nthe responsibility of the government to the popular majority are all\r\nlargely defeated under the American system. The last named end of the\r\nparty is defeated by the Constitution itself, and this, as hereinbefore\r\nshown, has operated to defeat the others as well.\r\n\r\nWe thus see that true party government is impossible under a\r\nconstitutional system which has as its chief end the limitation of the\r\npower of the majority. Where the party which has carried the election is\r\npowerless to enforce its policy, as is generally the case in this\r\ncountry, there can be no responsible party government. The only branch\r\nof our governmental system which responds readily to changes in public\r\nopinion is the House of Representatives. But this is and was designed to\r\nbe a subordinate body, having a voice in shaping only a part of the\r\npolicy of the government, and even in this limited field being unable to\r\nact except with the concurrence of the President, Senate and Supreme\r\nCourt. A change in public sentiment is not likely under these\r\ncircumstances to be followed by a corresponding change in the policy of\r\nthe state. Even when such change in sentiment is insistent and\r\nlong-continued, it may be unable to overcome the resistance of the more\r\nconservative influences in the Constitution. The most superficial\r\nexamination of our political history is sufficient to show that the\r\npractical working of our Constitution has in large measure defeated the\r\nend of party government. Calhoun's contention that the party had\r\nsucceeded in breaking down the elaborate system of constitutional checks\r\non the numerical majority is not borne out by the facts.\r\n\r\nEleven general elections since the adoption of the Constitution have\r\nresulted in a House of Representatives which had no political support in\r\nany other branch of the government. During eighty-four years of our\r\nhistory under the Constitution the party in the majority in the House\r\nhas not had a majority in all the other branches of the general\r\ngovernment, and consequently has not had the power to enforce its\r\npolicy. From 1874 to 1896--a period of twenty-two years--there were but\r\ntwo years (the 51st Congress) during which the same party had a majority\r\nin all branches of the government. But even during this brief period it\r\nfailed to control the treaty-making power since it lacked the two-thirds\r\nmajority in the Senate which the Constitution requires. In fact, there\r\nhas been no time since 1874 when any party had sufficient majority in\r\nthe Senate to give it an active control over the treaty-making power.\r\n\r\nThe more important and fundamental changes in public policy which\r\ninvolve an exercise of the amending power are still more securely\r\nplaced beyond the reach of party control. Not only the power to ratify\r\namendments, but even the power to propose them, is effectually withheld\r\nfrom the party, since it can scarcely ever command the required\r\ntwo-thirds majority in both houses of Congress or a majority in both\r\nbranches of the legislature in two-thirds of the states.\r\n\r\nUnder our constitutional system a political party may have a nominal\r\nmajority in all branches of the government and yet lack the power to\r\nenforce its policy. That branch of the government over which the party\r\nhas most control through frequent elections--viz., the House of\r\nRepresentatives--is the one which has least authority, while those which\r\nhave most influence in shaping the policy of the government are less\r\ndirectly subject to the penalties of party disapproval, as in the case\r\nof the President and Senate, or entirely exempt from any effective party\r\ncontrol as in the case of the Supreme Court. The division of authority\r\nunder our Constitution makes it possible for either house of Congress to\r\ngive the appearance of support to a measure which public opinion demands\r\nand at the same time really accomplish its defeat by simply not\r\nproviding the means essential to its enforcement. The opportunity thus\r\nafforded for the exercise of a covert but effective veto on important\r\nlegislation is a fruitful source of corruption. The extreme diffusion\r\nof power and responsibility is such as to make any effective party\r\ncontrol and responsibility impossible. This would be the case even if\r\nthe party were truly representative of public opinion. But when we\r\nconsider that the party is organized on a plan which in some measure at\r\nleast defeats both the popular choice of candidates and the expression\r\nof public opinion in party platforms, it is readily seen that the slight\r\ndegree of party control permitted under our system is in no true sense a\r\npopular control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nCHANGES IN THE STATE CONSTITUTIONS AFTER 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nThe effects of the conservative reaction were not confined to the\r\ngeneral government. The movement to limit the power of the popular\r\nmajority was felt in the domain of state as well as national politics.\r\nEven before the Constitutional Convention assembled the political\r\nreaction was modifying some of the state constitutions. This is seen\r\nespecially in the tendency to enlarge the powers of the judiciary which\r\nwas the only branch of the state government in which life tenure\r\nsurvived. This tendency received powerful encouragement and support in\r\nthe adoption of the Federal Constitution which secured to the judiciary\r\nof the general government an absolute veto on both federal and state\r\nlegislation. For as the state courts were not slow in following the\r\nprecedent set by the Federal courts, what had been before the adoption\r\nof the Constitution a mere tendency soon became the practice in all the\r\nstates. This in reality accomplished a revolution in the actual working\r\nof the state governments without any corresponding change in their\r\noutward form. It effected a redistribution of political powers which\r\ngreatly diminished the influence of the popularly elected and more\r\nresponsible branches of the state government and gave a controlling\r\ninfluence to that branch over which the people had least control.\r\n\r\nNot only was the state judiciary allowed to assume the veto power, but\r\ntheir independence of public opinion was more effectually safeguarded by\r\ndepriving a mere majority of the legislature of the power to remove\r\nthem. The provision of the Federal Constitution requiring a two-thirds\r\nmajority in the legislative body for removal by impeachment or otherwise\r\nwas quite generally copied. Without some such safeguard the party in\r\ncontrol of the legislature could prevent the exercise of the judicial\r\nveto by removing from office any judges who dared to oppose its policy.\r\n\r\nNew York and South Carolina were the only states adopting constitutions\r\nduring the Revolutionary period, which included provisions limiting the\r\npower of the majority to impeach public officials. The New York\r\nconstitution of 1777 required a two-thirds majority in the lower house,\r\nand the South Carolina constitution of 1778 a two-thirds majority in\r\nboth houses. Pennsylvania copied the impeachment provisions of the\r\nFederal Constitution in her constitution of 1790; Delaware went even\r\nfarther, and in her constitution of 1792, required a two-thirds majority\r\nin both houses; Georgia followed the example of the Federal\r\nConstitution in 1798; Virginia, in 1830; North Carolina, in 1835;\r\nVermont, in 1836; New Jersey, in 1844; and Maryland, in 1851.\r\n\r\nWith the progress of this movement to restore the system of checks in\r\nthe state constitutions the governor regained his independence of the\r\nlegislature and also many of the rights and prerogatives of which the\r\nRevolution had deprived him. He was made coordinate with the\r\nlegislature, set over against it and generally clothed with the\r\nqualified veto power, which made him for all practical purposes the\r\nthird house of that body. Georgia increased the governor's term of\r\noffice to two years and gave him the qualified veto power in 1798.\r\nPennsylvania made his term of office three years and gave him the veto\r\npower in 1790. New Hampshire conferred the veto power on him in 1792 and\r\nNew York in 1821.\r\n\r\nThis tendency to make the public official less directly dependent upon\r\nthe people or their immediate representatives is clearly seen in other\r\nimportant changes made in the state constitutions during this period.\r\nPopular control over the legislature was diminished by lengthening the\r\nterms of the members of both houses and by providing that the upper\r\nhouse should be elected for a longer term than the lower. Georgia\r\nestablished an upper house in 1789 and made the term of office of its\r\nmembers three years. In 1790 Pennsylvania also added a senate whose\r\nmembers were to be elected for four years, and South Carolina increased\r\nthe term of its senators from one to four years. Delaware extended the\r\nterm from one to two years for members of the lower house and from three\r\nto four years for members of the upper house and made the legislative\r\nsessions biennial instead of annual in 1831. North Carolina increased\r\nthe term of members of both houses from one to two years and adopted\r\nbiennial sessions in 1835. Maryland in 1837 extended the term of\r\nsenators from five to six years, and in 1846 established biennial\r\nsessions of the legislature. The responsibility of the legislature was\r\nstill further diminished by the gradual adoption of the plan of partial\r\nrenewal of the senate, which was incorporated in the Revolutionary\r\nconstitutions of Delaware, New York and Virginia and later copied in the\r\nFederal Constitution. This ensured the conservative and steadying\r\ninfluence exerted by a body of hold-over members in the upper house.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of five states in which the members of one branch of\r\nthe legislature were elected for terms varying from two to five years,\r\nthe Revolutionary state constitutions provided for the annual election\r\nof the entire legislature. This plan made both houses conform to the\r\nlatest expression of public opinion by the majority of the qualified\r\nvoters at the polls. And since neither the executive nor the courts\r\npossessed the veto power, the system ensured prompt compliance on the\r\npart of the law-making body with the demands of the people as expressed\r\nin the results of the legislative election.\r\n\r\nThe influence of public opinion on the state governments was greatly\r\nweakened by the constitutional changes above mentioned. The lower branch\r\nof the legislature, inasmuch as all its members were simultaneously\r\nelected, might be regarded as representative of recent, if not present,\r\npublic opinion, though effective popular control of that body was made\r\nmore difficult by lengthening the term of office, since this diminished\r\nthe frequency with which the voters could express in an authoritative\r\nmanner their disapproval of the official record of its members. Under\r\nthe plan adopted present public opinion as formulated in the results of\r\nthe last election was not recognized as entitled to control the state\r\nsenate.\r\n\r\nThese changes in the state constitutions by which the executive and\r\njudicial branches of the government acquired the veto power amounted in\r\npractice to the creation of a four-chambered legislature. By thus\r\nincreasing the number of bodies which it was necessary for the people to\r\ncontrol in order to secure the legislation which they desired, their\r\npower to influence the policy of the state government was thereby\r\ndiminished. And when we reflect that not only was legislative authority\r\nmore widely distributed, but each branch of the state government\r\nexercising it was also made less directly dependent on the qualified\r\nvoters, we can see that these constitutional provisions were in the\r\nnature of checks on the numerical majority.\r\n\r\nA consideration of the changes made in the method of amending the state\r\nconstitutions leads to the same conclusion. During the Revolutionary\r\nperiod, as we have seen, the tendency was strongly toward making the\r\nfundamental law the expression of the will of the numerical majority.\r\nDifficulties in the way of change were reduced to a minimum. But under\r\nthe influence of the political reaction which followed, and which\r\nproduced the Constitution of the United States, the state governments\r\nwere so organized as to make it more difficult for the majority to\r\nexercise the amending power. Georgia in 1789 changed the method of\r\namending the state constitution by requiring a two-thirds majority in a\r\nconstitutional convention, and made another change in 1798 by which a\r\ntwo-thirds majority in each house of the legislature and a three-fourths\r\nmajority in each house of the succeeding legislature was required for\r\nthe adoption of an amendment to the constitution. South Carolina in 1790\r\nadopted a provision guarding against mere majority amendment by making\r\nthe approval of a two-thirds majority in both branches of two\r\nsuccessive legislatures necessary for any changes in the constitution.\r\nConnecticut in 1818 restricted the power of amending by requiring a\r\nmajority in the house of representatives, a two-thirds majority in both\r\nhouses of the next legislature, and final approval by a majority of the\r\nelectors. New York in 1821 adopted a plan which required that an\r\namendment should receive a majority in each branch of the legislature, a\r\ntwo-thirds majority in each branch of the succeeding legislature, and be\r\napproved by a majority of the voters. North Carolina in 1835 made a\r\nthree-fifths majority in each house of the legislature and a two-thirds\r\nmajority of each house of the following legislature necessary for\r\nchanges in the constitution.\r\n\r\nThe judicial veto served the purpose of preventing majority amendment\r\nunder the guise of ordinary legislation, while a safeguard against\r\nconstitutional changes favored by a mere majority was thus provided in\r\nthe extraordinary majority required in both houses of the legislature to\r\npropose or adopt amendments. This, as has been shown in the case of the\r\nFederal Constitution, is a formidable check on the majority. In view of\r\nthis restriction upon the proposing of amendments the provision for\r\nratification by a popular majority, which owing to the progress of the\r\nlater democratic movement has now been generally adopted, is no real\r\nconcession to the principle of majority rule.\r\n\r\nAssuming that a two-thirds majority in the legislature is required to\r\npropose an amendment, and that the principle of representation is so\r\napplied that each party is represented in the legislature in proportion\r\nto its popular vote, it would scarcely ever be possible for any party to\r\npropose an amendment to the state constitution, since it can not be\r\nexpected under any ordinary conditions to control two-thirds of the\r\npopular vote. But inasmuch as the successful party often secures under\r\nour system much more than its proportional share of representation in\r\nthe legislature, it is by no means unusual for a party to have a\r\ntwo-thirds majority in both houses of a state legislature. This would\r\nappear to give the numerical majority under such conditions the power to\r\npropose and adopt amendments. Such would be the case if the party were\r\nreally responsible to those who supported it at the polls. But this\r\nwould assume the existence of a purely state party, organized with\r\nreference to state issues only, and carrying the election as the\r\nadvocate of a definite state policy. Moreover, it would presuppose all\r\nthose means, political and constitutional, by which the majority in the\r\nlegislature would be accountable to the popular majority in the state.\r\nThis is rendered impossible, however, as has been shown, by our system\r\nof government.\r\n\r\nThe above-mentioned changes in the constitutions of the older states may\r\nbe attributed in large measure to the reaction against democracy which\r\nbrought about the adoption of the Federal Constitution. They may be\r\nregarded as an expression of that distrust and fear of democracy which\r\nfilled the minds of those who framed and set up our Federal government.\r\nIt is not contended, however, that they are now so regarded by the\r\nmasses of the people. The work of deifying the Federal Constitution was\r\nsoon accomplished. And when the people had come to venerate it as the\r\nmost perfect embodiment of the doctrine of popular sovereignty that the\r\nintelligence of man could devise, it was but natural that they should\r\nacquiesce in the proposal to make the state governments conform more\r\nclosely to the general plan of that instrument. In view of the\r\nwidespread sentiment which amounted to a blind and unthinking worship of\r\nthe Constitution, it is not surprising that the political institutions\r\nof the general government should have been largely copied by the states.\r\nThe only surprising thing in this connection is the fact that they did\r\nnot follow the Federal model more closely, since every feature of it was\r\nthe object of the most extravagant eulogy. Here we see, however, an\r\ninconsistency between profession and practice. The people who tolerated\r\nno criticism of the Federal Constitution showed nevertheless a distrust\r\nof some of its more conservative features. Much as the indirect election\r\nof President and United States senators was favored by the framers of\r\nour Federal Constitution, there has been no tendency to apply that\r\nprinciple in the selection of the corresponding state officials.\r\n\r\nIn all the states framing new constitutions during the Revolutionary\r\nperiod, except Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and New York, the governor\r\nwas elected by the legislature. Pennsylvania abandoned indirect election\r\nand adopted election by the qualified voters in 1790; Delaware, in 1792;\r\nGeorgia, in 1824; North Carolina, in 1835; Maryland, in 1837; New\r\nJersey, in 1844; Virginia, in 1850; and South Carolina, in 1865. South\r\nCarolina and Maryland are the only states which have ever had indirect\r\nelection of the upper house. Both adopted it in 1776, the constitution\r\nof South Carolina providing that the members of the lower house should\r\nelect the members of the upper house, and the constitution of Maryland\r\nrequiring that members of the upper house should be chosen by an\r\nelectoral college. This was abandoned for direct election in South\r\nCarolina in 1778 and in Maryland in 1837.\r\n\r\nThe conservative reaction was soon followed by a new movement toward\r\ndemocracy. This no doubt largely explains the failure of the people to\r\nreproduce in their state constitutions all those features which they\r\nprofessed to admire in the Federal Constitution. Not only did they not\r\ncopy all the new features of that document, but they even discarded some\r\nof the then existing provisions of the state constitutions which had\r\nbeen copied in the Federal Constitution. The principle of indirect\r\nelection which was everywhere recognized in the choice of the state\r\njudiciary during the Revolutionary period was gradually abandoned for\r\nthe more democratic method of direct popular choice which has now become\r\nthe rule. The life tenure of judges which formerly existed in most of\r\nthe states has almost entirely disappeared. In all but four states the\r\njudges are now chosen for terms varying from two to twenty-one\r\nyears--the average length of the term being eight or ten years. The\r\ncombination of direct popular choice with a fixed term of office has had\r\nthe effect of making the state judiciary much more amenable to public\r\nopinion than the corresponding branch of the Federal government. By\r\nreason of the relatively long term for which the judges of the state\r\nsupreme court are elected, however, and the plan of gradual renewal\r\nwhich prevents present public opinion from ever gaining the ascendency\r\nin that body, it is still the least responsible and most conservative\r\nbranch of the state government.\r\n\r\nWe see, then, two motives exerting an influence in the remolding of the\r\nstate constitutions, one being the desire to copy the Federal\r\nConstitution and the other the belief that the state government should\r\nreflect the will of the people. That the attainment of one of these ends\r\nwould inevitably defeat the other was not generally recognized. The\r\nconviction which had become thoroughly rooted in the popular mind that\r\nthe system of checks and balances was the highest expression of\r\ndemocratic organization ensured the embodiment of the general features\r\nof that system in the constitutions of the various states. The\r\nconstitutional changes having this end in view largely destroyed the\r\nresponsibility of the state governments to the people and thus prevented\r\nthe very thing they were designed to accomplish. But however much this\r\nsystem was in reality opposed to the principle of direct popular\r\ncontrol, it was adopted by the people with the idea of making the\r\ngovernment more readily reflect their will. They were not conscious of\r\nany inconsistency in holding tenaciously to the doctrine of checks and\r\nbalances and at the same time seeking to give the people more control\r\nover the state governments. The latter purpose is clearly seen in the\r\nconstitutional changes relating to the tenure and manner of election of\r\nthe judiciary and in the adoption of universal suffrage. Summing up the\r\neffects of these changes in the state constitutions, we may say that the\r\nsuffrage was placed upon a democratic basis, the state judiciary was\r\norganized on a less irresponsible plan and the appearance of political\r\nresponsibility secured by applying the principle of direct election to\r\nevery branch of the state government. The longer term of office\r\nestablished for the legislative and executive branches of the state\r\ngovernment, however, together with the increase in the authority of the\r\njudiciary and the adoption of the system of checks and balances has upon\r\nthe whole had the effect of making the state government less responsive\r\nto the electorate.\r\n\r\nAs seen in preceding chapters, the framers of the Federal Constitution\r\nmade use of the scheme of checks and balances for the purpose of\r\nlimiting the power of the people. There is little evidence that they\r\nfavored diffusion of authority except in so far as that authority rested\r\nupon a popular basis. Hence they carried the plan much farther in\r\ncurtailing the power of the House of Representatives than a logical\r\napplication of the doctrine would have justified, while at the same time\r\ngiving more authority and power of independent action to the other\r\nbranches of the general government than was consistent with their\r\navowed, if not real, purpose.\r\n\r\nThey gave to the executive and judicial branches of the general\r\ngovernment power to control the administration of Federal laws. The\r\nenforcement of all laws and regulations of the general government, in\r\nso far as the President and Senate might desire to enforce them, was\r\nguaranteed through the power to appoint and remove those who were\r\nentrusted with their execution, while the right of appeal from a state\r\nto the Federal courts precluded the possibility of enforcing a state law\r\ndeemed to exceed the proper limits of state authority.\r\n\r\nIn the state governments on the other hand we find a high degree of\r\nadministrative decentralization. The governor, unlike the President, was\r\nnot given any adequate power to control those entrusted with the\r\nexecution of state laws. A multitude of directly elected local officials\r\nare the agents of the state for this purpose. And since they reflect the\r\nsentiment of the various local interests to which they owe their\r\nelection, it may and often does happen that a law to which those\r\ninterests are opposed is rendered practically inoperative through the\r\nefforts of those local officials who are sworn to enforce it. The\r\npractical working of this system often gives to a local community an\r\nadministrative veto on such general laws of the state as may be opposed\r\nto local sentiment. By this means the general executive authority of the\r\nstate is weakened and its responsibility correspondingly diminished.\r\n\r\nIn still another respect the policy of dividing authority and parcelling\r\nit out between separate and distinct organs of government has been\r\ncarried much farther in the state than in the Federal Constitution.\r\nUnlike the Federal government in which executive power is centralized in\r\nthe President, the state constitutions have created a number of separate\r\nofficials, boards and commissions, some directly elected and some\r\nappointed, independent of each other and irresponsible except in so far\r\nas a fixed term of office implies responsibility. This means that\r\ninstead of one executive the state has many. Only one of them--the\r\ngovernor--has, it is true, a veto on the enactment of laws; but this, as\r\nwe have seen, is really a legislative and not an executive power. Each\r\nof these has what may be termed an administrative veto; that is, the\r\npower to negative the laws which they are expected to administer by\r\nsimply not enforcing them. The impossibility of securing an honest and\r\nfaithful administration of the laws where the responsibility for their\r\nenforcement is divided between a number of separate and practically\r\nindependent officials, is clearly shown in the experience of the various\r\nstates. The evils of this system are illustrated in the state laws\r\nenacted for the purpose of controlling the railway business. Provision\r\nis usually made for their enforcement through a railway commission\r\neither directly elected or appointed by the governor. That direct\r\nelection by the people for a fixed term, thereby securing independence\r\nduring that term, fails to guarantee the enforcement of such laws is\r\nstrikingly shown in the experience of California, where this body has\r\nbeen continually under the domination of the railway interests.[159]\r\n\r\nUnder a system which thus minutely subdivides and distributes the\r\nadministrative function, any effective control over the execution of\r\nstate laws is made impossible. The governor, who is nominally the head\r\nof the executive agencies of the state, is not in reality responsible,\r\nsince he has no adequate power to compel the enforcement of laws\r\ndirectly entrusted to other independent state officials. Any interest or\r\ncombination of interests that may wish to prevent the enforcement of\r\ncertain laws may be able to accomplish their end by merely controlling\r\nthe one official or board whose duty it is to enforce the law in\r\nquestion. Their task would be a much more difficult one, if it were\r\nnecessary to control for that purpose the entire executive arm of the\r\nstate. The opportunity for the corrupt use of money and influence is\r\nthus vastly increased, since the people, though they might watch and\r\njudge fairly well the conduct of one state executive, can not exercise\r\nany effective censorship over a large number of such officials.\r\n\r\nThis irresponsibility which arises out of a wide diffusion of power is\r\nnot confined to the executive branch of the state government. The\r\nlegislature in the course of our political development has taken on the\r\nsame elaborate committee organization which characterizes, as we have\r\nseen, our Federal Congress. The same sinister influences working through\r\nsimilar agencies oppose needed legislation. But although the good bills\r\nare frequently killed or mutilated in the secrecy of the committee room,\r\nthe skilful use of money or other corrupt influence often secures the\r\nenactment of laws opposed to the interests of the people. Moreover, the\r\npractice known as log-rolling by which the representatives of various\r\nlocal interests combine and force through measures which secure to each\r\nof certain localities some advantage at the expense of the state at\r\nlarge are so common as to excite no surprise.\r\n\r\nThe relation existing between the executive and legislative branches\r\nunder our system is another source of irresponsibility, since it does\r\nnot follow simply because a law has been placed upon the statute books\r\nof a state that it can be enforced. An act may be passed in response to\r\na strong public sentiment, it may be constitutional and the executive\r\nmay be willing and may even desire to enforce it, and yet be unable to\r\ndo so. The legislature may, and frequently does, enact laws under the\r\npressure of public opinion while at the same time quietly exercising\r\nwhat is, in effect, a veto on their execution. In the case of much\r\nimportant legislation it can accomplish this by merely not\r\nappropriating the funds which are required for their enforcement. The\r\nlaws against adulteration are a good illustration. An official known\r\nperhaps as a dairy and food commissioner may be provided for, whose duty\r\nit is to enforce these laws. The nature of the work entrusted to him\r\nrequires that he should have a corps of assistants, inspectors who are\r\nto keep a watchful eye on the goods likely to be adulterated and collect\r\nsamples of such goods from the various places in the state where they\r\nare exposed for sale, and chemists who are to analyze the samples thus\r\nprocured and determine whether manufacturers and dealers are complying\r\nwith the law. Unless an adequate sum is appropriated for this purpose,\r\nand for prosecuting those who are violating the law, such laws can not\r\nbe enforced.\r\n\r\nIn our state governments the subdivision of authority has been carried\r\nso far that no effective control over the enactment or enforcement of\r\nstate laws is possible. Under the influence of the doctrine of checks\r\nand balances the policy of widely distributing political authority has\r\ninured to the benefit of those private interests which are ever seeking\r\nto control the government for their own ends, since it has supplied the\r\nconditions under which the people find it difficult to fix the blame for\r\nofficial misconduct. Indeed it may be said that wherever power should be\r\nconcentrated to ensure responsibility, it has been almost invariably\r\ndistributed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nMUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nOur municipal government, like the rest of our political system, was\r\noriginally an inheritance from England. The governing power in colonial\r\ntimes was a single body, the common council, such as exists in England\r\nto-day, composed of mayor, recorder, aldermen, and councilmen. As a rule\r\nthe councilmen were elected annually by the qualified voters, while the\r\nmayor was appointed by the colonial governor. The council had authority\r\nto enact local regulations not in conflict with English or colonial\r\nlegislation. The mayor had no veto and usually no appointing power.\r\n\r\nThe Revolution did not modify the general scheme of municipal government\r\nin any important respect. The mayor was still, as a rule, appointed by\r\nthe governor, who now owed his office directly or indirectly to the\r\nqualified voters of the state. The power to grant municipal charters,\r\nwhich before the Revolution was exercised by the provincial governor,\r\nwas now lodged in the state legislature.\r\n\r\nThe important changes in municipal government were made after, and may\r\nbe regarded as an effect of the adoption of the Federal Constitution. As\r\nthe centralization of authority in the hands of the common council could\r\nnot be reconciled with the new doctrine of checks and balances,\r\nmunicipal government was reorganized on the plan of distributed powers.\r\nThis effort to readjust the political organization of the city and make\r\nit conform to the general scheme of the Federal government is seen in\r\nthe municipal charters granted after the adoption of the Constitution.\r\nThe tendency toward a bicameral council, the extension of the term for\r\nwhich members of the council were elected and the veto power of the\r\nmayor may be attributed to the influence of the Constitution rather than\r\nto any intelligent and carefully planned effort to improve the machinery\r\nof municipal government.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of the state governments, the development of the system\r\nwas influenced by the growing belief in democracy. Property\r\nqualifications for the suffrage disappeared, and the mayor became a\r\ndirectly elected local official. The changes made in municipal\r\ngovernment, however, as a concession to the newer democratic thought,\r\ndid not ensure any very large measure of popular control. Municipal\r\ngovernment in its practical working remained essentially undemocratic.\r\n\r\nIt would be perfectly reasonable to expect that popular government\r\nwould reach its highest development in the cities. Here modern democracy\r\nwas born; here we find the physical and social conditions which\r\nfacilitate interchange of thought and concerted action on the part of\r\nthe people. Moreover, the government of the city is more directly and\r\nimmediately related to the citizens than is the government of state or\r\nnation. It touches them at more points, makes more demands upon them and\r\nis more vitally related to their everyday life and needs than either\r\nstate or national government. For these reasons the most conspicuous\r\nsuccesses of democracy should be the government of present-day cities.\r\nUnder a truly democratic system this would doubtless be the case. But in\r\nthis country the most glaring abuses and most conspicuous failures of\r\ngovernment occur in the cities. The enemies of popular government have\r\nused this fact for the purpose of discrediting the theory of democracy.\r\nThey would have us believe that this is the natural result of a system\r\nwhich places political authority in the hands of the masses--that it is\r\nthe fruit of an extreme democracy. This conclusion rests upon the\r\nassumption that municipal government in this country is democratic--an\r\nassumption which will not bear investigation. American cities are far\r\nfrom being examples of extreme democracy. In some important respects\r\nthey are less democratic than the government of either state or nation.\r\nA careful analysis of the situation shows clearly that the municipal\r\nevils so frequently attributed to an excess of democracy are really due\r\nto the system of checks by which all effective power to regulate\r\nmunicipal matters is withheld from the majority. In this country popular\r\ncontrol is reduced to a minimum in the cities, while in Great Britain\r\nand the countries of western Europe we find in municipal government the\r\nnearest approach to democracy. This is the true explanation of the fact\r\nthat municipal government is our greatest failure and their most\r\nconspicuous success.\r\n\r\nUnder any consistent application of the theory of democracy a city would\r\nbe entitled to the fullest measure of local self-government. It ought to\r\nbe given an absolutely free hand to initiate and carry out any policies\r\nof purely local concern. This right, however, the American city does not\r\npossess. Local self-government is recognized neither in theory nor in\r\npractice under our political scheme. The true local unit is the city,\r\nand this, according to our legal and constitutional theory, is merely\r\nthe creature of the state legislature. The latter called it into being,\r\ndetermines what powers it may exercise, and may strip it of them at\r\npleasure. According to the prevailing practice of our state legislatures\r\nand the almost uniform decisions of our courts the exercise of local\r\nself-government by our cities is to be regarded as a mere privilege and\r\nnot a right.\r\n\r\nThe municipal charter was originally a grant of certain privileges of\r\nlocal government in return for money payments or other services rendered\r\nto the king. It was a mere concession of privileges based upon\r\nexpediency, and not a recognition on the part of the Crown of local\r\nself-government as an admitted right. As an express and formal statement\r\nof the measure of local government which the king would bind himself to\r\nrespect, it tended to limit his power of interference in matters covered\r\nby such charter, since privileges solemnly granted could not with safety\r\nbe lightly and arbitrarily disregarded. Municipal charters thus have the\r\nsame origin as the constitution of the state itself, in that they are\r\nthe outcome of an effort to place a check upon an irresponsible central\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nThe legislature of the American commonwealth in succeeding to the power\r\nof the king over municipal charters manifested at first an inclination\r\nto concede to the city the right to a measure of local self-government.\r\nThus \"the city of New York received from the English kings during the\r\ncolonial period a charter which, on the Declaration of the Independence\r\nof the colony of New York, and the establishment of the new state of New\r\nYork, was confirmed by the first Constitution of the state. For a\r\nconsiderable period after the adoption of this constitution, changes in\r\nthat charter were made upon the initiation of the people of the city,\r\nwhich initiation took place through the medium of charter conventions\r\nwhose members were elected by the people of the city, and no statute\r\nwhich was passed by the legislature of the state relative to the affairs\r\nof the city of New York took effect within the city until it had been\r\napproved by the city.\"[160]\r\n\r\nBut as Professor Goodnow observes, American cities \"have very largely\r\nlost their original powers of local self-government.\"[161] The original\r\nconception of the city charter as a contract which established certain\r\nrights of local self-government which the legislature was bound to\r\nrespect, merely recognized municipal corporations as entitled to the\r\nsame exemption from unreasonable legislative interference, as the courts\r\nhave since the Dartmouth College decision enforced in favor of private\r\ncorporations. If this view had prevailed cities could not have been\r\ndeprived arbitrarily of rights once recognized by the legislature, but\r\nthey could have enforced the recognition of no rights not thus granted.\r\nThe recognition of this doctrine would have prevented many of the abuses\r\nthat have characterized the relation between state and municipal\r\ngovernment in this country, but it would have guaranteed no rights which\r\nthe legislature had not seen fit to confer. Any liberal interpretation\r\nof the theory of democracy must of necessity go farther than this, and\r\nmake municipal self-government a fundamental right which the central\r\nauthority of the state can, not only neither abridge nor destroy, but\r\ncan not even withhold, since it is a right having its source not in a\r\nlegislative grant, but in the underlying principles of popular\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThe failure to recognize the right of local self-government as\r\nfundamental in any scheme of democracy was unfortunate. Some of the\r\nworst evils of municipal government would have been avoided, however, if\r\nauthority once granted to municipalities had been treated by the courts\r\nas a limitation of the power of the legislature to interfere in purely\r\nlocal matters. The refusal of the state government to recognize an\r\nappropriate sphere of municipal activity which it would have no right to\r\ninvade, has been the main cause of corruption and inefficiency in\r\nmunicipal government.\r\n\r\nThe policy of state interference in municipal affairs was the inevitable\r\noutgrowth of the doctrine that cities had no powers except such as had\r\nbeen expressly given, or were necessarily implied in their charters.\r\nThis lack of the power of initiative made it necessary for cities, as\r\nthey increased in size and complexity, to make constant appeals to the\r\nlegislature for permission to supply their wants. Every new problem\r\nwhich the city had to deal with, every new function which it had to\r\nperform, was a ground for state interference. This necessity of invoking\r\nthe aid of the state legislature, constantly felt in every rapidly\r\ngrowing city, tended to develop a feeling of dependence upon legislative\r\nintervention as an indispensable factor in the solution of local\r\nproblems. Thus the refusal of the state government to recognize the\r\nright of municipal initiative compelled the cities to welcome state\r\ninterference as the only means of dealing with the new problems with\r\nwhich they were being continually confronted.\r\n\r\nAnother reason for the extension of state authority at the expense of\r\nthe municipality is to be found in the twofold character of city\r\ngovernment. Besides being a local government the city is also for\r\ncertain purposes the administrative agent of the state, and as such is\r\nproperly subject to state supervision. But, in the absence of any clear\r\ndistinction between state and local interests, it was an easy matter for\r\nprotection of the former to serve as a pretext for undue interference\r\nwith the latter.\r\n\r\nThe city was thus placed at the mercy of the state government, since the\r\nlegislature could make the needs of the municipality or the protection\r\nof the general interests of the state a pretext for any interference\r\ncalculated to further the private or partisan ends of those who\r\ncontrolled the legislative machine. As cities increased in importance it\r\nwas found that this unlimited power over them could be made a valuable\r\nasset of the party machine in control of the state legislature. The city\r\noffered a rich and tempting field for exploitation. It had offices, a\r\nlarge revenue, spent vast sums in public improvements, let valuable\r\ncontracts of various kinds and had certain needs, as for water, light,\r\nrapid transit, etc., which could be made the pretext for granting\r\nfranchises and other privileges on such terms as would ensure large\r\nprofits to the grantees at the expense of the general public. That the\r\npolitical machine in control of the state government should have yielded\r\nto the temptation to make a selfish use of its powers in this direction,\r\nis only what might have been expected.\r\n\r\n\"The legislature has often claimed also the right to appoint municipal\r\nofficers and to fix and change the details of municipal organization,\r\nhas legislated municipal officers out of office, and established new\r\noffices. In certain cases it has even provided that certain specific\r\ncity streets shall be paved, has imposed burdens upon cities for the\r\npurpose of constructing sewers or bringing in water; has regulated the\r\nmethods of transportation to be adopted within the limits of cities; in\r\na word, has attended to a great number of matters which are purely local\r\nin character; matters which do not affect the people of the state as a\r\nwhole, and in regard to which there is little excuse for special\r\nlegislative action.\"[162]\r\n\r\nThe extent to which state regulation of local matters has been carried\r\nin New York is indicated by the fact that in the year 1886 \"280 of the\r\n681 acts passed by the legislature ... interfered directly with the\r\naffairs of some particular county, city, village, or town, specifically\r\nand expressly named....\r\n\r\n\"The Philadelphia City Hall Building affords a good example of how far\r\nthis lack of local responsibility may sometimes carry the legislature in\r\nthe exercise of local powers, and in the imposition of financial burdens\r\non cities. 'In 1870 the legislature decided that the city should have\r\nnew buildings. The act [which was passed to accomplish this result]\r\nselected certain citizens by name, whom it appointed commissioners for\r\nthe erection of the buildings. It made this body perpetual by\r\nauthorizing it to fill vacancies.... This commission was imposed by the\r\nlegislature upon the city, and given absolute control to create debts\r\nfor the purpose named, and to require the levy of taxes for their\r\npayment.\r\n\r\n\"'The public buildings at Broad and Market streets were,' in the words\r\nof Judge Paxson, 'projected upon a scale of magnificence better suited\r\nfor the capitol of an empire than the municipal buildings of a\r\ndebt-burdened city.' Yet this act was declared constitutional, the city\r\nwas compelled to supply the necessary funds, and 'for nearly twenty\r\nyears all the money that could be spared from immediate and pressing\r\nneeds' was 'compulsorily expended upon an enormous pile which surpasses\r\nthe town halls and cathedrals of the Middle Ages in extent if not in\r\ngrandeur.'\"[163]\r\n\r\nThe legislature is strongly tempted to abuse its power when the party\r\nmachine in control of the state does not have the political support of\r\nthe local authorities. One of the most notorious examples of such\r\ninterference in recent years was the so-called \"ripper\" legislation\r\nenacted in Pennsylvania in 1901, by which the mayors of Pittsburg and\r\nAllegheny were removed from office and the governor given the power to\r\nappoint and remove their successors until the regular municipal election\r\nin the year 1903. The motive for this legislation was the desire to\r\ncrush local opposition to the state machine by putting the control of\r\nmunicipal offices in the hands of a governor friendly to the political\r\nboss of the state. In order to provide an opportunity for the mayor\r\nappointed by the governor to use his office in building up and\r\nperpetuating a local machine that would support the clique in control of\r\nthe state government, the appointee of the governor was declared\r\neligible for re-election, although his locally elected successors were\r\nmade ineligible. A more flagrant abuse of legislative authority could\r\nhardly be imagined; yet this act was declared constitutional by the\r\nsupreme court of the state.\r\n\r\nMany such instances of partisan interference may be found in the recent\r\nlegislation of some of the larger and more populous states.\r\n\r\nThe best example of the misgovernment of cities by the legislature for\r\nprivate or partisan ends is seen in the franchise legislation by which\r\nprivileges of great value have been secured by street railway and other\r\ncorporations without any compensation to the cities concerned. The power\r\nwhich the legislature can exercise in the interest of private\r\ncorporations monopolizing for their own profit the very necessities of\r\nlife in the modern city--water, light, transportation, communication,\r\netc.--has been one of the most serious evils resulting from state\r\ndomination of municipal affairs. It exposed the legislature to the\r\ntemptation which individuals and corporations seeking valuable\r\nconcessions readily took advantage of for their own gain. It thus\r\nbrought into active operation those forces which have been the chief\r\nfactor in corrupting both state and municipal government.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it came to be generally recognized that state control of\r\nlocal affairs not only did not prevent, but was, in fact, the chief\r\nsource of the misrule of American cities, an effort was made to provide\r\na remedy by the adoption of constitutional provisions regulating the\r\npower of the legislature to interfere in municipal affairs. These\r\nlimitations relate to those matters wherein the evils of state\r\ninterference have been most pronounced. Thus in some states the\r\nlegislature is not allowed to grant the use of streets to railways or\r\nother private companies without the consent of the municipal\r\nauthorities; to create special commissions and bestow upon them\r\nmunicipal functions; or to incorporate cities or regulate them by\r\nspecial laws.\r\n\r\nIt was not the purpose of these constitutional provisions to grant to\r\nmunicipalities any immunity from state control, but merely to forbid\r\ncertain modes of exercising legislative supervision which, as experience\r\nhad shown, were liable to serious abuses. The prohibition of special\r\nlegislation, generally incorporated in recent state constitutions, has,\r\nhowever, largely failed to accomplish its purpose, owing to the fact\r\nthat the courts have permitted the legislature to establish so many\r\nclasses of cities that it has been able to pass special acts under the\r\nguise of general laws.\r\n\r\nThe state of Ohio furnishes a good example of the practical\r\nnullification of a constitutional provision by the legislature through\r\nthe abuse of its power of classification. The constitution of 1851\r\nprohibited the legislature from passing any special act conferring\r\ncorporate powers and provided for the organization of cities by general\r\nlaws. The legislature, however, adopted a method of classifying cities\r\nwhich defeated the object of this provision. In 1901 each of the eleven\r\nprincipal cities in the state was in a separate class. Consequently all\r\nlaws enacted for each of these classes were in reality special acts, and\r\nas such were clearly an evasion of the constitutional prohibition of\r\nspecial legislation. Nevertheless, this method of classification had\r\nbeen repeatedly upheld by the courts. Its advantages to the party in\r\ncontrol of the state government were obvious, since it gave the\r\nlegislature a free hand in interfering in local affairs for partisan\r\nends. It permitted the state machine to make concessions to a city which\r\ngave it political support and at the same time extend state control over\r\nthose cities in which it encountered opposition. This was the situation\r\ndown to 1902, when the supreme court rendered two decisions which\r\noverthrew the system of classification in vogue and invalidated the\r\ncharter of every city in the state. It is unfortunate that this change\r\nin the attitude of the court, though much to be desired, occurred at a\r\ntime when it had the appearance of serving a partisan end. One of these\r\nsuits was brought by the Republican attorney-general of the state to\r\nhave the charter of the city of Cleveland declared invalid on the ground\r\nthat it was a special act. This charter had been in force for over ten\r\nyears, having granted liberal corporate powers at a time when Cleveland\r\nwas a Republican city. Later it passed into the Democratic column, and\r\nthis suit was instituted as part of the plan of the Republican machine\r\nof the state to curb the power and influence of the mayor of that city.\r\nThe new municipal code which was adopted at an extra session of the\r\nlegislature provided a scheme of government applicable to Cleveland\r\nunder which the powers of the mayor were much curtailed.\r\n\r\nIn the New York constitution of 1894 an effort was made to guard against\r\nthe abuse of special legislation. The cities of the state were by the\r\nconstitution itself divided into three classes according to population,\r\nand any law which did not apply to all the cities of a class was\r\ndeclared to be a special act. Special legislation was not prohibited;\r\nbut when any act of this kind was passed by the legislature it was\r\nrequired to be submitted to the authorities of the city or cities in\r\nquestion, and if disapproved of by them after a public hearing, it could\r\nbecome law only by being passed again in the regular manner. This merely\r\nafforded to the cities affected by the proposed special legislation an\r\nopportunity to protest against its enactment, the legislature having\r\nfull power to pass it in the face of local disapproval. That this is not\r\nan adequate remedy for the evils of special legislation is shown by the\r\nfact that the two charters of New York City enacted since this\r\nconstitution went into effect, have both been framed by a\r\nstate-appointed commission and passed over the veto of the mayor.\r\n\r\nThe constitutional changes which have been mentioned must not be\r\nunderstood as implying any repudiation of the doctrine that a municipal\r\ncorporation is a creature of the general government of the state. These\r\nprovisions merely secured, or rather sought to secure, to cities some\r\nbenefits of a negative character--immunity from certain recognized\r\nabuses of legislative authority. They are the expression of an effort to\r\nfind a remedy for the evils of municipal government by restricting the\r\nauthority of the legislature rather than by giving cities the power to\r\nact independently in local matters. They have diminished somewhat the\r\nevils of state interference, but they failed to remove the cause by\r\ngiving the cities the constitutional right to control their own affairs.\r\n\r\nThe failure of all these measures to accomplish what was expected of\r\nthem finally brought the advocates of municipal reform to a realization\r\nof the fact that the American system made no provision for real local\r\nself-government, and that our refusal to recognize this principle was\r\nthe chief cause of the prevalent corruption and misrule of our cities\r\nand the insuperable obstacle to all effective and thoroughgoing reform.\r\nAs soon as attention was directed to this feature of the problem it was\r\nseen that no system could be devised that would be better adapted to the\r\npurpose of defeating the end of good city government, since those who\r\nwould be directly benefited by the reforms in municipal government were\r\npowerless to bring them about except with the co-operation of the\r\nlegislature. Moreover the consent of the legislature, though once given,\r\nwas liable at any time to be withdrawn at the instigation of private or\r\npartisan interests, since this body was not directly interested in\r\nestablishing and maintaining good municipal government nor responsible\r\nto those who were.\r\n\r\nIt was finally seen that some more effective measure than the\r\nprohibition of special legislation was required. The next step was the\r\nattempt to secure to cities the needed authority in local matters by\r\nmeans of a constitutional provision authorizing them to frame their own\r\ncharters. In this movement the state of Missouri led the way by\r\nincorporating a home-rule provision in its constitution of 1875.\r\nCalifornia, Washington, Minnesota, and Colorado have since adopted\r\nsimilar provisions. In each of these states the charter is framed by a\r\ncommission locally elected except in Minnesota, where it is appointed by\r\nthe district judge.\r\n\r\nIn Missouri this privilege is accorded only to cities having more than\r\n100,000 inhabitants. The constitution of California adopted in 1879\r\nalso restricted the benefits of home rule to cities of more than 100,000\r\npopulation, but it has since been extended to all cities having more\r\nthan 3,500 inhabitants. Washington allows all cities having 20,000 or\r\nmore population to frame their own charters. Minnesota extends the\r\nprivilege to all cities and villages without respect to size, while\r\nColorado restricts it to cities having more than 2,000 inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe right to serve as a member of a charter commission is limited to\r\nfreeholders in all these states except Colorado, where it is restricted\r\nto taxpayers. The object of these home-rule provisions was to give\r\ncities some measure of initiative in local affairs without at the same\r\ntime permitting them to organize on the plan of simple majority rule. In\r\nthe Missouri constitution of 1875 a four-sevenths vote was required to\r\nadopt a charter and a three-fifths vote to ratify an amendment, although\r\nthe constitution itself was adopted and could be amended by mere\r\nmajority vote. The constitution of California permits ratification by a\r\nmajority of the qualified voters, but every charter thus ratified must\r\nbe submitted to the legislature for its approval or rejection as a\r\nwhole. No charter amendment can be adopted except by a three-fifths\r\nmajority of the popular vote and subsequent legislative approval,\r\nalthough, as in the case of Missouri, a majority vote is sufficient to\r\napprove an amendment to the state constitution. In Washington the\r\nconstitution provides for the ratification of charters and charter\r\namendments by a majority of the qualified electors. The constitutional\r\namendment adopted in Minnesota in 1896, with its subsequent\r\nmodifications, provides for the ratification of charters and charter\r\namendments by a four-sevenths vote except in the case of certain cities\r\nwhere a three-fourths majority is required. A three-fifths vote in favor\r\nof a charter amendment is necessary for its ratification. Colorado, by a\r\nconstitutional amendment adopted in 1902, permits the ratification and\r\namendment of charters by a majority vote. A constitutional amendment\r\nadopted in Missouri in 1902 provides for the ratification of charters by\r\nmajority vote.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of California, where the constitutional amendment of\r\n1902 allows 15 per cent. of the qualified voters to require the\r\nsubmission of a charter amendment, and Colorado, where 25 per cent. of\r\nthe voters have that right, the states above mentioned make no provision\r\nin their constitutions for the popular initiative. Both Washington and\r\nMinnesota, however, have permitted it by statute, the former on the\r\napplication of 15 per cent., and the latter when 5 per cent. of the\r\nqualified voters demand it.\r\n\r\nThe chief defect of these constitutional provisions relating to home\r\nrule is that they do not really grant it. There are too many\r\nrestrictions imposed upon cities availing themselves of this privilege,\r\nand in two of the states in question, notably in Missouri, they are for\r\nthe benefit of the larger cities only. The restriction of the\r\ncharter-framing right to freeholders, the withholding from the majority\r\nof the power to amend in California and Minnesota, and the failure to\r\nprovide in the constitution for the popular initiative in Missouri,\r\nWashington, and Minnesota indicate a willingness to grant the right of\r\nhome rule only under such conditions as are calculated to ensure\r\nadequate limitation of the power of the majority.\r\n\r\nThese constitutional provisions certainly point in the direction which\r\nwe must follow if we would find any satisfactory solution of our\r\nmunicipal problem. They would, if liberally interpreted by the courts,\r\nsecure to cities immunity from interference in local matters. But the\r\ncourts are naturally opposed to innovations in our constitutional\r\nsystem, and have consequently been disposed to give provisions of this\r\ncharacter such an interpretation as will minimize their effect. The\r\nrequirement that the charters framed under these provisions must be in\r\nharmony with the constitution and laws of the state has been declared by\r\nthe courts to mean that they must not only conform to the laws in force\r\nat the time the charters are adopted, but also that they must conform to\r\nall legislation subsequently enacted. Had the courts been thoroughly\r\nimbued with the principle of local self-government, they could easily\r\nhave given these constitutional provisions an interpretation which would\r\nhave effectually deprived the legislature of the power to interfere in\r\npurely local affairs. They could have declared all acts by which the\r\nstate government sought to invade the sphere of local affairs null and\r\nvoid, just as they have all acts of the municipal government which have\r\nencroached upon the powers reserved exclusively to the state. What the\r\ncourts have done, however, is to hold that these constitutional\r\nprovisions merely authorize cities to govern themselves in accordance\r\nwith the constitution and in harmony with such laws as the legislature\r\nhas or may hereafter enact. The city may adopt a charter which is in\r\nharmony with the constitution and the laws of the state, but the charter\r\nthus adopted may be freely modified by general laws relating to cities.\r\nThe unfriendly attitude of the courts has thus largely defeated the\r\nobject of these home-rule provisions. The state legislature is still\r\nfree to encroach upon or abridge the sphere of municipal\r\nself-government.\r\n\r\nThe constitutional provisions above mentioned may be regarded as having\r\na twofold purpose. They were designed to limit, if not destroy, the\r\npower of the legislature to invade the sphere of municipal affairs, and\r\nalso to confer upon cities the general power to act for themselves, by\r\nvirtue of which they could on their own initiative, subject to certain\r\nrestrictions contained in the constitution, set up their own government,\r\nformulate and carry out a municipal policy and manage their own affairs\r\nto suit themselves. This would seem to be implied necessarily in the\r\ngrant of constitutional power to frame a charter for their own\r\ngovernment. A liberal interpretation of this feature of the\r\nconstitutions in question would have held that all cities to which it\r\napplied were thereby authorized to exercise all powers not expressly\r\nwithheld by the constitution or the statutes of the state. This,\r\nhowever, has not been the attitude of the courts. Their reluctance to\r\ngive home-rule provisions a liberal interpretation may be illustrated by\r\na decision of the supreme court of Washington. In addition to the power\r\ngranted to cities of the first class to frame their own charters the\r\nconstitution of this state provides that \"any county, city, town, or\r\ntownship, may make and enforce within its limits all such local, police,\r\nsanitary and other regulations as are not in conflict with general\r\nlaws.\" In view of the attitude that courts have generally taken in this\r\nmatter it is not surprising that the supreme court of Washington has\r\nintimated that the above-mentioned constitutional provisions are not\r\nself-executing. Moreover, it does not seem disposed to concede even to\r\ncities of the first class any important powers except such as have been\r\nexpressly conferred by statute. For example, the statutes of Washington\r\nauthorize cities of the first class \"to regulate and control the use\" of\r\ngas supplied by a private corporation, and the charter of Tacoma\r\nexpressly gave to the city council the power to fix the price of gas so\r\nsupplied. Suit was brought to enjoin the city from exercising this power\r\nwhich was claimed under the constitutional and statutory authority given\r\nto cities of the first class. The supreme court held that while Tacoma\r\nhad the power to regulate and control, expressly given it by statute, it\r\ndid not have the power to fix the price.[164] This decision evinces a\r\nsingular lack of sympathy on the part of the court with the home-rule\r\nprovisions of the constitution of Washington.\r\n\r\nBut although the effort to confer upon cities by constitutional\r\nenactment the power to manage their own affairs has thus far largely\r\nfailed, it indicates a growing appreciation of the nature of the problem\r\nand the character of the remedy that must be applied. A more clearly\r\ndefined and effective public opinion in favor of municipal\r\nself-government must in the end overcome judicial opposition.\r\n\r\nThe most liberal interpretation of which these constitutional provisions\r\nare susceptible, however, would not have ensured complete municipal\r\nself-government. Unless a city is given adequate financial powers, a\r\nconstitutional grant of the right of local self-government does not\r\nenable it to exercise much choice in relation to the more important\r\nmatters of municipal policy. By narrowly limiting the powers of cities\r\nin this direction, they have been largely deprived of the advantages\r\nwhich they would have enjoyed under a consistent application of the\r\nhome-rule principle. A certain amount of freedom in the use of the\r\ntaxing power would seem to be no less essential to the city than to the\r\nstate itself. Within reasonable limits it ought to be conceded the right\r\nto formulate its own scheme of taxation. In every important American\r\ncity the taxes collected for municipal purposes greatly exceed those\r\nimposed for the support of the county and state government. In a matter\r\nwhich so vitally concerns the city it ought to have some right to pursue\r\na policy of its own. This right has not been recognized, however, even\r\nin the constitutions which have made most concessions to the principle\r\nof municipal home rule. By this means all innovations or reforms in\r\nmunicipal taxation except such as may be authorized by the state itself\r\nare effectually prevented. It could not, for instance, exempt personal\r\nproperty from taxation, or make a tax on ground rent the main source of\r\nits revenue.\r\n\r\nThe power to incur debt for municipal purposes is no less essential than\r\nthe power to tax. The present-day city must spend large sums in making\r\npublic improvements the cost of which it is necessary to distribute over\r\na period of years. To limit too narrowly the borrowing power of cities\r\nfor these purposes would prevent them from realizing the full benefits\r\nof unhampered self-government. This does not imply that a city should\r\nown and operate all industries of a quasi-public character, but it does\r\nimply that it should have the unquestioned right and the power to do so.\r\nUnless this is the case it is not in a position to secure the most\r\nfavorable terms from such private corporations as may be allowed to\r\noccupy this field. Unreasonable restrictions upon the borrowing power of\r\ncities by placing obstacles in the way of municipal ownership of public\r\nutilities tend to deprive the people of the most effective safeguard\r\nagainst the extortion of private monopolies.\r\n\r\nThe limitation placed upon the amount of municipal indebtedness has not\r\nhad altogether the effect intended. This is mainly due to the fact that\r\nthe debt limit fixed in the state constitutions was in many cases so low\r\nthat it did not permit cities to make absolutely necessary public\r\nimprovements, such as the paving of streets and construction of sewers.\r\nTo make these improvements without resorting to credit would require the\r\nowners of the property affected to advance the full amount of their\r\ncost. This would in many instances be extremely inconvenient.\r\nAccordingly, an effort was made to find some method of evading these\r\nrestrictions which would be upheld by the courts. This was accomplished\r\nby issuing bonds to be paid out of a special fund which was to be\r\ncreated by taxes assessed against the property of the district charged\r\nwith the cost of the improvements. The courts held that this was merely\r\na lien upon the property of the district in question, and not a\r\nmunicipal debt within the meaning of the above-mentioned constitutional\r\nlimitations. These decisions by the courts may not appear to be in\r\nharmony with the letter of the constitutional provisions relating to\r\nmunicipal indebtedness, but they are hardly at variance with their\r\nspirit. The object of these restrictions was not so much to limit the\r\nrights of the property-owning classes as to protect them against the\r\nextravagance of the propertyless voters. To make an exception in favor\r\nof municipal indebtedness incurred in this way and for these purposes\r\nwas not calculated to work any hardship upon property owners, but rather\r\nto give them the power to authorize the employment of credit for their\r\nown advantage. They were protected against the abuse of this particular\r\nkind of indebtedness inasmuch as the consent of the owners of a majority\r\nof the property affected was quite generally required.\r\n\r\nOne influence which helped to mold a public sentiment in favor of\r\nconstitutional provisions limiting the amount of municipal indebtedness\r\nwas the rapid increase in the debts of American cities during the period\r\nthat immediately followed the Civil war. For this condition of affairs\r\nthe state government itself was largely to blame. It had prescribed a\r\nform of municipal organization which was scarcely compatible with an\r\nefficient and responsible management of financial matters. Moreover, the\r\nstate government, as we have seen, could empower its own agents to\r\nborrow money for a purpose which it had authorized and obligate the city\r\nto pay it. The effort to correct these evils, first noticeable about the\r\nyear 1870, took the form of constitutional provisions limiting the\r\namount of indebtedness which could be incurred by or on behalf of\r\ncities. The main object of these provisions was to protect municipal\r\ntaxpayers against an extravagant use of the borrowing power for local\r\npurposes, whether exercised by state or municipal authorities.\r\n\r\nAnother advantage which these provisions seemed likely to secure to the\r\ncapital-owning class deserves at least a passing mention. This policy of\r\nlimiting the amount of municipal indebtedness was adopted at a time\r\nwhen, owing to the rapid growth of urban population, the local\r\nmonopolies of water, light, transportation, etc., were becoming an\r\nimportant and extremely profitable field for the investment of private\r\ncapital. The restrictions imposed upon the power of cities to borrow\r\nmoney would retard, if not preclude, the adoption of a policy of\r\nmunicipal ownership and thus enable the private capitalist to retain\r\nexclusive possession of this important class of industries.\r\n\r\nThat the constitutional restrictions upon the general indebtedness of\r\ncities have retarded the movement toward municipal ownership is beyond\r\nquestion. It is not likely, however, that they will much longer block\r\nthe way to municipal acquisition of those industries in which private\r\nmanagement has proven unsatisfactory, since it may be possible to evade\r\nthem by resorting to the device of a _special fund_. The same line of\r\nargument which has been accepted by the courts as supporting the\r\nconstitutionality of the special fund for local improvement purposes is\r\nno less applicable to special debts incurred for the purchase of\r\nrevenue-producing public utilities, such as water works, lighting plants\r\nand street railways. Under this arrangement, however, the city must not\r\nassume any responsibility for the payment of the capital borrowed, the\r\ncreditors advancing the purchase price or cost of construction, looking\r\nsolely to the earnings under municipal operation for the payment of both\r\nprincipal and interest. It may be doubted whether the courts in\r\npermitting cities to employ the special fund in relation to local\r\nimprovements realized its possibilities in the direction of municipal\r\nownership.[165]\r\n\r\nThese restrictions upon the powers of cities indicate a fear that too\r\nmuch local self-government might jeopardize the interests of the\r\npropertied classes. This attitude on the part of those who have framed\r\nand interpreted our state constitutions is merely an expression of that\r\ndistrust of majority rule which is, as we have seen, the distinguishing\r\nfeature of the American system of government. It is in the cities that\r\nthe non-possessing classes are numerically strongest and the inequality\r\nin the distribution of wealth most pronounced. This largely explains the\r\nreluctance of the state to allow cities a free hand in the management of\r\nlocal affairs. A municipal government responsive to public opinion might\r\nbe too much inclined to make the public interests a pretext for\r\ndisregarding property rights. State control of cities, then, may be\r\nregarded as a means of protecting the local minority against the local\r\nmajority. Every attempt to reform this system must encounter the\r\nopposition of the property-owning class, which is one of the chief\r\nreasons why all efforts to establish municipal self-government have thus\r\nfar largely failed.\r\n\r\nWe thus see that while property qualifications for the suffrage have\r\ndisappeared, the influence of property still survives. In many ways and\r\nfor many purposes property is directly or indirectly recognized in the\r\norganization and administration of municipal government. The movement\r\ntoward democracy has had less influence upon property qualifications for\r\nthe suffrage and for office-holding in its relation to municipal than in\r\nits relation to state and national affairs. When the Federal\r\nConstitution was adopted the property qualifications for voting and\r\noffice-holding in force in the various states were not disturbed. The\r\nConstitution did not recognize the principle of universal suffrage. It\r\nnot only allowed the states to retain the power to prescribe the\r\nqualifications of voters in state and municipal elections, but also\r\nlimited the suffrage for Federal purposes to those who were qualified to\r\nvote at state elections.[166] The removal, during the first half of the\r\nnineteenth century, of property qualifications for voting at state\r\nelections and holding state offices had the effect of placing the\r\nFederal suffrage upon a popular basis.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the democratic movement was less marked, however, in\r\nthe domain of municipal affairs. Here the old system under which voting\r\nand office-holding were regarded as the exclusive right of the\r\nproperty-owning class has not entirely disappeared. In this as in other\r\nrespects the American state has evinced a fear of municipal democracy.\r\nIt is true that in the choice of public officials the principle of\r\nmanhood suffrage prevails. But the suffrage may be exercised either with\r\nreference to candidates or measures; and in voting upon questions of\r\nmunicipal policy, which is far more important than the right to select\r\nadministrative officers, the suffrage is often restricted to taxpayers\r\nor the owners of real estate. Thus in Colorado, which has gone as far as\r\nany state in the Union in the direction of municipal democracy, no\r\nfranchise can be granted to a private corporation or debt incurred by a\r\ncity for the purpose of municipal ownership without the approval of the\r\ntaxpaying electors. When we consider that 72 per cent. of the families\r\nliving in Denver in the year 1900 occupied rented houses,[167] and that\r\nthe household goods of a head of a family to the value of two hundred\r\ndollars are exempt from taxation,[168] the effect of this restriction is\r\nobvious. In thus limiting the right to vote, the framers of the state\r\nconstitution evidently proceeded upon the theory that the policy of a\r\ncity with reference to its public utilities should be controlled by its\r\ntaxpayers. The justification for this constitutional provision is not\r\napparent, however, inasmuch as the burden of supporting the public\r\nservice industries of a city is not borne by the taxpayers as such, but\r\nby the people generally. Such a system makes it possible for the\r\ntaxpaying class to control public utilities in their own interest and to\r\nthe disadvantage of the general public. The part of the community who\r\nare taxpayers, if given the exclusive right to control these industries,\r\nwould be tempted to make them an important source of municipal revenue.\r\nThey would be likely to favor high rather than low or reasonable charges\r\nfor these necessary public services, since their taxes would be\r\ndiminished by the amount thus taken from the non-taxpayers through\r\nexcessive charges. Where the majority of the citizens are property\r\nowners and taxpayers there is but little danger that public ownership\r\nwill be subject to this abuse. But where there is great inequality in\r\nthe distribution of wealth and a large propertyless class, democracy is\r\nthe only guarantee that the benefits of municipal ownership will not be\r\nmonopolized by the property-owning class.\r\n\r\nAn investigation of the practical working of municipal ownership in\r\nAmerican cities will show that this danger is not purely imaginary. In\r\nthe year 1899 53.73 per cent. of the waterworks in this country were\r\nowned and operated by municipalities, public ownership being the rule in\r\nthe larger cities. Taking the thirteen largest plants in the United\r\nStates, all of which were municipally owned, the income from private\r\nusers was $20,545,409, while the total cost of production, including\r\nestimated depreciation, aggregated only $11,469,732. If to this amount\r\nbe added the estimated taxes, interest on total investment and rental\r\nvalue of the municipally owned quarters occupied for this purpose, the\r\ntotal cost of production would be $22,827,825. Private consumers,\r\nhowever, used only 80.2 per cent. of the water supplied. If the 19.8 per\r\ncent. supplied free for public purposes had been paid for at the same\r\nrate charged to private users, the total income from these 13\r\nmunicipally owned plants would have been $25,817,720. This would have\r\nbeen $2,989,895 in excess of a fair return upon the total investment. No\r\none would claim that the price of water has been increased under\r\nmunicipal ownership. As a matter of fact, it has been substantially\r\nreduced and the quality of the water at the same time improved. The\r\nreduction in price, however, has been less than it would have been, had\r\nthe interests of the consumers alone been considered. If the object of\r\nmunicipal ownership is to supply pure water at the lowest possible price\r\nto the general public, there is no good reason why the city should\r\ndemand a profit on the capital it has invested in the business. This\r\nwould certainly be true where the earnings under municipal ownership\r\nhave been sufficient to pay for the plant. In this case it would be an\r\ninjustice to consumers to make them contribute, over and above the cost\r\nof operating the plant, an additional amount sufficient to pay interest\r\non the investment, inasmuch as they have supplied the capital with which\r\nthe business is carried on. Any attempt to make municipal ownership a\r\nsource of revenue would mean the taxation of water consumers for the\r\nbenefit of property owners. Nor is there any reason why the private\r\nconsumers of water should be made to pay for the water used for public\r\npurposes. The water needed for public buildings, for cleaning streets\r\nand for extinguishing fires ought to be paid for by those chiefly\r\nbenefited--the property-owning class.\r\n\r\nIf instead of considering these thirteen waterworks together, we take a\r\nsingle example--the third largest plant--the tendency to make public\r\nownership a source of revenue is more clearly seen. The income from\r\nprivate users in the case of this plant was $4,459,404. The city used\r\nfor public purposes 29.5 per cent. of the total amount supplied, which\r\nif paid for at the rate charged private consumers would have made the\r\ntotal income from operation $6,325,395. This would have been $2,929,232\r\nmore than was required to pay all expenses, including interest on the\r\ntotal investment.[169]\r\n\r\nIn the case of electric-light plants private ownership is the rule, only\r\n460 of the 3,032 plants being under municipal ownership. The Report of\r\nthe United States Commissioner of Labor[170] gives the data for 952 of\r\nthese plants, 320 of which are municipally owned and operated. Municipal\r\nownership, however, is mainly confined to the smaller cities and towns.\r\nThis is shown by the fact that although more than one-third of the 952\r\nplants above mentioned are under municipal control, only 30 out of 277,\r\nor less than one-ninth of the largest plants, are municipally owned.\r\nThis is to be accounted for by the more determined opposition to the\r\npolicy of municipal ownership by the capitalist class in the larger\r\ncities, where private management is most remunerative. Municipal plants,\r\ntoo, are often restricted to public lighting, not being allowed to\r\nfurnish light or power for commercial purposes. This restricted form of\r\nmunicipal ownership is merely a slight concession on the part of the\r\nprivate monopolist to the taxpaying class. The general public, as\r\nconsumers of light and power, derive no benefit from such a policy.\r\n\r\nThese and other facts which might be mentioned illustrate the natural\r\ntendency of a system under which the power of the masses is limited in\r\nthe interest of the property-owning class. The chief evils of municipal\r\ngovernment in this country have their source not in majority but in\r\nminority rule. It is in the city where we find a numerically small but\r\nvery wealthy class and a large class owning little or no property that\r\nthe general political movement toward democracy has encountered the most\r\nobstinate resistance. Only a small part of our urban population own land\r\nor capital. The overwhelming majority of those who live in cities are\r\nemployees and tenants. In the year 1900 74.3 per cent. of the families\r\nin the 160 cities of the United States having 25,000 or more population\r\nlived in rented houses and only 14.5 per cent. in unmortgaged\r\nhomes.[171] In the smaller towns the proportion of property owners was\r\nlarger, while in the country the majority of the population belonged to\r\nthe land-holding class, 64.4 per cent. of the \"farm\" families owning\r\ntheir homes, 44.4 per cent. of such families owning homes that were\r\nunencumbered.[172]\r\n\r\n\"Much has been said concerning the necessity of legislative interference\r\nin some cases where bad men were coming into power through universal\r\nsuffrage in cities, but the recent experience of the country shows that\r\nthis has oftener been said to pave the way for bad men to obtain office\r\nor grants of unusual powers from the legislature than with any purpose\r\nto effect local reforms. And the great municipal scandals and frauds\r\nthat have prevailed, like those which were so notorious in New York\r\nCity, have been made possible and then nursed and fostered by\r\nillegitimate interference at the seat of State government.\"[173]\r\n\r\nThe numerical preponderance of the property-owning class in the country\r\nand of the propertyless class in the cities must be taken into account\r\nin any attempt to find an explanation of the reluctance on the part of\r\nthe state to recognize the principle of municipal self-government. When\r\nwe consider that the state government, even under universal suffrage, is\r\nlargely government by taxpaying property owners, we can understand why\r\nthe progress toward municipal democracy has been so slow. Under\r\nuniversal suffrage municipal self-government would mean the ascendency\r\nof the propertyless class, and this, from the standpoint of those who\r\ncontrol the state government, would jeopardize the interests of the\r\nproperty-holding minority.\r\n\r\nThis is doubtless one of the chief reasons why the state government has\r\nnot been willing to relinquish its control over municipal affairs. This\r\nfact is not recognized, however, by present-day writers on American\r\npolitics. It is generally assumed that the corruption in state and\r\nmunicipal government is largely due to the ascendency of the masses.\r\nThis view of the matter may be acceptable to those who from principle or\r\ninterest are opposed to democracy, but it ignores the facts which a\r\ncareful analysis of the system discloses. Even in our state governments\r\nthe changes that have been made as a concession to the newer democratic\r\nthought are less important than is generally supposed. The removal of\r\nproperty qualifications for voting and office-holding was a concession\r\nin form rather than in substance. It occurred at a time when there was\r\nan apparently inexhaustible supply of free land which made it possible\r\nfor every one to become a landowner. Under such circumstances universal\r\nsuffrage was not a radical or dangerous innovation. In fact, property\r\nqualifications for voting and office-holding were not necessary to the\r\npolitical ascendency of property owners in a community where the great\r\nmajority of the citizens were or could become members of the\r\nproperty-owning class. It is not likely that property qualifications\r\nwould have been removed for state purposes without a more serious\r\nstruggle, if the wide diffusion of property in the state at large had\r\nnot appeared to be an ample guarantee that the interests of property\r\nowners would not be endangered by universal suffrage. It was probably\r\nnot intended that the abolition of property qualifications should\r\noverthrow the influence of property owners, or make any radical change\r\nin the policy of the state government.\r\n\r\nIt is easily seen that the removal of property qualifications for\r\nvoting and office-holding has had the effect of retarding the movement\r\ntoward municipal home rule. Before universal suffrage was established\r\nthe property-owning class was in control of both state and city\r\ngovernment. This made state interference in local affairs unnecessary\r\nfor the protection of property. But with the introduction of universal\r\nsuffrage the conservative element which dominated the state government\r\nnaturally favored a policy of state interference as the only means of\r\nprotecting the property-owning class in the cities. In this they were\r\nactively supported by the corrupt politicians and selfish business\r\ninterests that sought to exploit the cities for private ends. Our\r\nmunicipal conditions are thus the natural result of this alliance\r\nbetween conservatism and corruption.\r\n\r\nWe can understand now why the state has been unwilling to permit the\r\nsame measure of democracy in municipal affairs that it has seen fit to\r\nemploy for its own purposes. This is why our limited majority rule,\r\nwhich may be safe enough in the state government, is often deemed\r\ninexpedient for the city. It is also the reason for keeping the more\r\nimportant municipal powers under the control of the state government, as\r\nwell as the ground for continuing property qualifications in the city\r\nafter their disappearance from the government of the state.\r\n\r\nThe checks above mentioned are not the only ones to be found, however,\r\nin our municipal government. The city is organized, like the state\r\ngovernment, on the plan of distributed powers and diffused\r\nresponsibility. It contains, as a rule, an elaborate system of checks\r\nwhich affords little opportunity for the prompt and effective expression\r\nof local public opinion in the administration of municipal affairs. At\r\nthe same time, it gives the municipal authorities power to inaugurate\r\nand carry out policies to which local public sentiment may be strongly\r\nopposed. This is seen in the control which the mayor and council quite\r\ngenerally exercise over the matter of municipal franchises. Probably not\r\na city of any importance could be mentioned in which the council has not\r\ngranted privileges which have enriched individuals and private\r\ncorporations at the expense of the public. This power has been the chief\r\nsource of municipal corruption, since it has made the misgovernment of\r\ncities a source of great profit to a wealthy and influential class.\r\nThose who imagine that the ignorant and vicious part of our urban\r\npopulation is the main obstacle to reform take but a superficial view of\r\nthe matter. The real source of misgovernment--the active cause of\r\ncorruption--is to be found, not in the slums, not in the population\r\nordinarily regarded as ignorant and vicious, but in the selfishness and\r\ngreed of those who are the recognized leaders in commercial and\r\nindustrial affairs. It is this class that, as Lincoln Steffens says,\r\nmay be found \"buying boodlers in St. Louis, defending grafters in\r\nMinneapolis, originating corruption in Pittsburg, sharing with bosses in\r\nPhiladelphia, deploring reform in Chicago, and beating good government\r\nwith corruption funds in New York.\"[174] This is the natural fruit of\r\nour system of municipal government. The powerful corporate interests\r\nengaged in the exploitation of municipal franchises are securely\r\nentrenched behind a series of constitutional and legal checks on the\r\nmajority which makes it extremely difficult for public opinion to\r\nexercise any effective control over them. The effort to provide a remedy\r\nfor this condition of affairs took the form of a movement to limit the\r\npowers of the council. Boards and commissions have been created in whose\r\nhands have been placed much of the business formerly controlled by this\r\nbody. The policy of subdividing the legislative authority of the city\r\nand distributing it among a number of independent boards has been\r\ncarried so far, notably in New York, that, as Seth Low observes, the\r\ncouncil has been largely deprived of all its legislative functions with\r\nthe single exception of the power to grant public franchises.[175] It\r\nmust not be inferred, however, that public opinion has favored the\r\nretention of this power by the council. The attempt on the part of the\r\npeople to control the franchise-granting power has thus far largely\r\nfailed, not because of any lack of popular support, but because our\r\nconstitutional and political arrangements have made it almost impossible\r\nfor any reasonable majority to overcome the opposition of organized\r\nwealth.\r\n\r\nOur efforts to bring about reforms in municipal government have thus far\r\nlargely failed to accomplish what was expected of them because we have\r\npersistently refused to recognize the principle of majority rule. We\r\nhave clung tenaciously to the system of checks and balances with all its\r\nrestraints on popular control. The evils of municipal government are not\r\nthe evils of democracy, but the evils of a system which limits the power\r\nof the majority in the interest of the minority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nINDIVIDUAL LIBERTY AND THE CONSTITUTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe eighteenth-century conception of liberty was the outgrowth of the\r\npolitical conditions of that time. Government was largely in the hands\r\nof a ruling class who were able to further their own interests at the\r\nexpense of the many who were unrepresented. It was but natural under\r\nthese circumstances that the people should seek to limit the exercise of\r\npolitical authority, since every check imposed upon the government\r\nlessened the dangers of class rule. The problem which the advocates of\r\npolitical reform had to solve was how to secure the largest measure of\r\nindividual liberty compatible with an irresponsible government. They\r\nwere right in believing that this could be accomplished only by building\r\nup an elaborate system of constitutional restraints which would narrowly\r\nlimit the exercise of irresponsible authority. Individual liberty as\r\nthey understood the term was immunity from unjust interference at the\r\nhands of a minority.\r\n\r\nThis was a purely negative conception. It involved nothing more than the\r\nidea of protection against the evils of irresponsible government. It\r\nwas a view of liberty adapted, however, to the needs of the time and\r\nserved a useful purpose in aiding the movement to curb without\r\ndestroying the power of the ruling class. Any attempt to push the\r\ndoctrine of liberty farther than this and make it include more than mere\r\nimmunity from governmental interference would have been revolutionary.\r\nThe seventeenth and eighteenth century demand was not for the abolition,\r\nbut for the limitation of irresponsible authority. It was not for\r\npopular government based upon universal suffrage, but for such\r\nmodifications of the system as would give to the commercial and\r\nindustrial classes the power to resist all encroachments upon their\r\nrights at the hands of the hereditary branches of the government. The\r\nbasis and guarantee of individual liberty, as the term was then\r\nunderstood, was the popular veto such as was exercised through the House\r\nof Commons. This conception of liberty was realized for those\r\nrepresented in any coordinate branch of the government wherever the\r\ncheck and balance stage of political development had been reached.\r\n\r\nThe American revolution, which supplanted hereditary by popular rule,\r\nworked a fundamental change in the relation of the individual to the\r\ngovernment. So far at least as the voters were concerned the government\r\nwas no longer an alien institution--an authority imposed upon them from\r\nabove, but an organization emanating from them--one in which they had\r\nand felt a direct proprietary interest. It was no longer a government in\r\nwhich the active principle was irresponsible authority, but one which\r\nrested upon the safe and trustworthy basis of popular control.\r\n\r\nThe overthrow of monarchy and aristocracy necessitated a corresponding\r\nchange in the idea of liberty to make it fit the new political\r\nconditions which had emerged. In so far as government had now passed\r\ninto the hands of the people there was no longer any reason to fear that\r\nit would encroach upon what they regarded as their rights. With the\r\ntransition, then, from class to popular sovereignty there was a\r\ncorresponding change in the attitude of the people toward the\r\ngovernment. They naturally desired to limit the authority and restrict\r\nthe activity of the government as long as they felt that it was\r\nirresponsible; but as soon as they acquired an active control over it,\r\nthe reason which formerly actuated them in desiring to limit its powers\r\nwas no longer operative. Their ends could now be accomplished and their\r\ninterests best furthered by unhampered political activity. They would\r\nnow desire to remove the checks upon the government for the same reason\r\nthat they formerly sought to impose them--viz., to promote their own\r\nwelfare.\r\n\r\nThis tendency is seen in the changes made in the state constitutions at\r\nthe beginning of the American revolution. As shown in a previous\r\nchapter, they established the supremacy of the legislative body and\r\nthrough this branch of the government, the supremacy of the majority of\r\nthe qualified voters. We have here a new conception of liberty. We see a\r\ntendency in these constitutional changes to reject the old passive view\r\nof state interference as limited by the consent of the governed and take\r\nthe view that real liberty implies much more than the mere power of\r\nconstitutional resistance--that it is something positive, that its\r\nessence is the power to actively control and direct the policy of the\r\nstate. The early state constitutions thus represent a long step in the\r\ndirection of unlimited responsible government.\r\n\r\nThis, as we have seen, was the chief danger which the conservative\r\nclasses saw in the form of government established at the outbreak of the\r\nRevolution. They were afraid that the power of the numerical majority\r\nwould be employed to further the interests of the many at the expense of\r\nthe few, and to guard against such a use of the government they sought\r\nto re-establish the system of checks. The Constitution which restored\r\nthe old scheme of government in a new garb also revived the old\r\nconception of individual liberty. There is, however, one important\r\ndifference between the eighteenth-century conception of liberty and that\r\nwhich finds expression in our constitutional literature. Formerly it was\r\nbecause of the lack of popular control that the people generally\r\ndesired to limit the authority of the government, but the framers of the\r\nConstitution wished to bring about the limitation of governmental\r\nfunctions because they feared the consequences of majority rule.\r\nFormerly the many advocated the limitation of the power of king and\r\naristocracy in the interest of liberty; now the few advocate the\r\nlimitation of the power of the many for their own protection. With the\r\nabolition of monarchy and aristocracy the attitude of the few and the\r\nmany has been reversed. The aristocratic and special interests that\r\nformerly opposed the limitation of political activity when they were\r\npredominant in the government, now favor it as a protection against the\r\ngrowing power of the masses, while the latter, who formerly favored, now\r\noppose it. The conservative classes now regard the popular majority with\r\nthe same distrust which the liberals formerly felt toward the king and\r\naristocracy. In fact, the present-day conservative goes even farther\r\nthan this and would have us believe that the popular majority is a much\r\ngreater menace to liberty than king or aristocracy has ever been in the\r\npast.\r\n\r\n\"There can be no tyranny of a monarch so intolerable,\" says a recent\r\nAmerican writer, \"as that of the multitude, for it has the power behind\r\nit that no king can sway.\"[176] This is and has all along been the\r\nattitude of the conservative classes who never lose an opportunity to\r\nbring the theory of democracy into disrepute. The defenders of the\r\nAmerican Constitution clearly see that unless the fundamental principle\r\nof popular government is discredited the system of checks can not\r\nsurvive.\r\n\r\nThere is no liberty, we are told by the present-day followers of\r\nAlexander Hamilton, where the majority is supreme. The American\r\npolitical system realizes this conception of liberty mainly through the\r\nSupreme Court--an organ of government which interprets the Constitution\r\nand laws of Congress and which may forbid the carrying out of the\r\nexpressed will of the popular majority. It necessarily follows that the\r\nauthority which can thus overrule the majority and enforce its own views\r\nof the system is an authority greater than the majority. All governments\r\nmust belong to one or the other of two classes according as the ultimate\r\nbasis of political power is the many or the few. There is, in fact, no\r\nmiddle ground. We must either recognize the many as supreme, with no\r\nchecks upon their authority except such as are implied in their own\r\nintelligence, sense of justice and spirit of fair play, or we must\r\naccept the view that the ultimate authority is in the hands of the few.\r\nEvery scheme under which the power of the majority is limited means in\r\nits practical operation the subordination of the majority to the\r\nminority. This inevitable consequence of the limitation of popular rule\r\nis not alluded to by the advocates of checks and balances, though it is\r\nobvious to any careful student of the system.\r\n\r\nIt would, however, do injustice to the intelligence of those who\r\nchampion the scheme of checks and balances to give them credit for any\r\nreal sympathy with the aims and purposes of democracy. Individual\r\nliberty as guaranteed by majority rule was not the end which the framers\r\nof the Constitution had in view, nor is it the reason why the\r\npresent-day conservative defends their work. The Constitution as\r\noriginally adopted did not contain that highly prized guarantee of\r\npersonal liberty which democracy everywhere insists upon. The failure to\r\nmake any provision for freedom of the press should be regarded as a\r\nsignificant omission. This, however, was not an essential part of the\r\nFederalists' scheme of government, which aimed rather to protect the\r\nproperty and privileges of the few than to guarantee personal liberty to\r\nthe masses. This omission is the more noteworthy in view of the fact\r\nthat this guarantee was at that time expressly included in a majority of\r\nthe state constitutions, and that the temper of the people was such as\r\nto compel its speedy adoption as an amendment to the Federal\r\nConstitution itself.\r\n\r\nLiberty, as the framers of the Constitution understood the term, had to\r\ndo primarily with property and property rights. The chief danger which\r\nthey saw in the Revolutionary state governments was the opportunity\r\nafforded to the majority to legislate upon matters which the well-to-do\r\nclasses wished to place beyond the reach of popular interference. The\r\nunlimited authority which the state government had over taxation and its\r\npower to restrict or abridge property rights were viewed with alarm by\r\nthe wealthy classes, who felt that any considerable measure of democracy\r\nwould be likely to deprive them of their time-honored prerogatives. To\r\nguard against this danger the Constitution sought, in the interest of\r\nthe classes which dominated the Federal Convention, to give the widest\r\npossible scope to private property. It prohibited private property in\r\nnothing--permitting it, as originally adopted, even in human beings. It\r\nmay be said without exaggeration that the American scheme of government\r\nwas planned and set up to perpetuate the ascendency of the\r\nproperty-holding class in a society leavened with democratic ideas.\r\nThose who framed it were fully alive to the fact that their economic\r\nadvantages could be retained only by maintaining their class ascendency\r\nin the government. They understood the economic significance of\r\ndemocracy. They realized that if the supremacy of the majority were once\r\nfully established the entire policy of the government would be\r\nprofoundly changed. They foresaw that it would mean the abolition of all\r\nprivate monopoly and the abridgment and regulation of property rights\r\nin the interest of the general public.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution was in form a political document, but its significance\r\nwas mainly economic. It was the outcome of an organized movement on the\r\npart of a class to surround themselves with legal and constitutional\r\nguarantees which would check the tendency toward democratic legislation.\r\nThese were made effective through the attitude of the United States\r\ncourts which, as Professor Burgess says, \"have never declined\r\njurisdiction where private property was immediately affected on the\r\nground that the question was political.\"[177]\r\n\r\n\"There can be no question that the national government has given to the\r\nminority a greater protection than it has enjoyed anywhere else in the\r\nworld, save in those countries where the minority is a specially\r\nprivileged aristocracy and the right of suffrage is limited. So absolute\r\nhave property rights been held by the Supreme Court, that it even, by\r\nthe Dred Scott decision, in effect made the whole country a land of\r\nslavery, because the slave was property, and the rights of property were\r\nsacred.\"[178]\r\n\r\nIn carrying out the original intent of the Constitution with reference\r\nto property the courts have developed and applied the doctrine of vested\r\nrights--a doctrine which has been used with telling effect for the\r\npurpose of defeating democratic reforms. This doctrine briefly stated is\r\nthat property rights once granted are sacred and inviolable. A rigid\r\nadherence to this policy would effectually deprive the government of the\r\npower to make the laws governing private property conform to social and\r\neconomic changes. It would disregard the fact that vested rights are\r\noften vested wrongs, and that one important, if not indeed the most\r\nimportant, task which a government by and for the people has to perform\r\nis to rectify past mistakes and correct the evils growing out of\r\ncorruption and class rule. A government without authority to interfere\r\nwith vested rights would have little power to promote the general\r\nwelfare through legislation.\r\n\r\nThe adoption of the Constitution brought this doctrine from the realm of\r\npolitical speculation into the arena of practical politics. The men who\r\nframed and set up our Federal government were shrewd enough to see that\r\nif the interests of the property-holding classes were to be given\r\neffective protection, it was necessary that political power should rest\r\nultimately upon a class basis. This they expected to accomplish largely\r\nthrough the judicial veto and the power and influence of the Supreme\r\nCourt. The effect of establishing the supremacy of this branch of the\r\ngovernment was to make the legal profession virtually a ruling class. To\r\ntheir charge was committed under our system of government the final\r\nauthority in all matters of legislation. They largely represent by\r\nvirtue of their training and by reason of the interests with which they\r\nare affiliated, the conservative as opposed to the democratic\r\ninfluences. The power and influence exerted by lawyers in this country\r\nare the natural outgrowth of the constitutional position of our Supreme\r\nCourt. Its supremacy is in the last analysis the supremacy of lawyers as\r\na class and through them of the various interests which they represent\r\nand from which they derive their support. This explains the fact so\r\noften commented on by foreign critics, that in this country lawyers\r\nexert a predominant influence in political matters.\r\n\r\nWe are still keeping alive in our legal and constitutional literature\r\nthe eighteenth-century notion of liberty. Our future lawyers and judges\r\nare still trained in the old conception of government--that the chief\r\npurpose of a constitution is to limit the power of the majority. In the\r\nmeantime all other democratic countries have outgrown this early\r\nconception which characterized the infancy of democracy. They have in\r\ntheory at least repudiated the eighteenth-century doctrine that the few\r\nhave a right to thwart the will of the many. The majority has in such\r\ncountries become the only recognized source of legitimate authority.\r\n\"There is no fulcrum _outside_ of the majority, and therefore there is\r\nnothing on which, as _against_ the majority resistance or lengthened\r\nopposition can lean.\"[179] This statement was made with reference to\r\nFrance, but it would apply as well to England, Switzerland, and all\r\nother countries in which the principle of majority rule has received\r\nfull recognition.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand American constitutional and legal literature still\r\ninculcates and keeps alive fear and distrust of majority rule. The\r\nofficial and ruling class in this country has been profoundly influenced\r\nby political ideas which have long been discarded in the countries which\r\nhave made the most rapid strides in the direction of popular government.\r\nThe influence which our constitutional and legal literature, based as it\r\nis upon a profound distrust of majority rule, has had upon the lawyers,\r\npoliticians, and public men of this country can hardly be overestimated.\r\nIt is true that many who have been most influenced by this spirit of\r\ndistrust toward popular government would be unwilling to admit that they\r\nare opposed to majority rule--in fact, they may regard themselves as\r\nsincere believers in democracy. This is not to be wondered at when we\r\nconsider that throughout our history under the Constitution the old and\r\nthe new have been systematically jumbled in our political literature. In\r\nfact, the main effort of our constitutional writers would appear to be\r\nto give to the undemocratic eighteenth-century political ideas a garb\r\nand setting that would in a measure reconcile them with the democratic\r\npoint of view. The natural and inevitable result has followed. The\r\nstudents of American political literature have imbibed the fundamental\r\nidea of the old system--its distrust of majority rule--along with a\r\ncertain sentimental attachment to and acceptance of the outward forms of\r\ndemocracy. This irreconcilable contradiction between the form and the\r\nsubstance, the body and the spirit of our political institutions is not\r\ngenerally recognized even by the American students of government.\r\nConstitutional writers have been too much preoccupied with the thought\r\nof defending and glorifying the work of the fathers and not enough\r\ninterested in disclosing its true relation to present-day thought and\r\ntendencies. As a consequence of this, the political ideas of our\r\neducated classes represent a curious admixture of democratic beliefs\r\nsuperimposed upon a hardly conscious substratum of eighteenth-century\r\ndoctrines. It is this contradiction in our thinking that has been one of\r\nour chief sources of difficulty in dealing with political problems.\r\nWhile honestly believing that we have been endeavoring to make democracy\r\na success, we have at the same time tenaciously held on to the essential\r\nfeatures of a political system designed for the purpose of defeating the\r\nends of popular government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nINDIVIDUAL LIBERTY AND THE ECONOMIC SYSTEM\r\n\r\n\r\nThe American doctrine of individual liberty had its origin in economic\r\nconditions widely different from those which prevail to-day. The tools\r\nof production were simple and inexpensive and their ownership widely\r\ndiffused. There was no capital-owning class in the modern sense.\r\nBusiness was carried on upon a small scale. The individual was his own\r\nemployer, or, if working for another, could look forward to the time\r\nwhen, by the exercise of ordinary ability and thrift, he might become an\r\nindependent producer. The way was open by which every intelligent and\r\nindustrious wage-earner could become his own master. Industrially\r\nsociety was democratic to a degree which it is difficult for us to\r\nrealize at the present day. This economic independence which the\r\nindustrial classes enjoyed ensured a large measure of individual liberty\r\nin spite of the fact that political control was in the hands of a class.\r\n\r\nThe degree of individual freedom and initiative which a community may\r\nenjoy is not wholly, or even mainly, a matter of constitutional forms.\r\nThe actual liberty of the individual may vary greatly without any change\r\nin the legal or constitutional organization of society. A political\r\nsystem essentially undemocratic would be much less destructive of\r\nindividual liberty in a society where the economic life was simple and\r\nownership widely diffused than in a community possessing a wealthy\r\ncapitalist class on the one hand and an army of wage-earners on the\r\nother. The political system reacts, it is true, upon the economic\r\norganization, but the influence of the latter upon the individual is\r\nmore direct and immediate than that of the former. The control exerted\r\nover the individual directly by the government may, as a matter of fact,\r\nbe slight in comparison with that which is exercised through the various\r\nagencies which control the economic system. But the close\r\ninterdependence between the political and the business organization of\r\nsociety can not be overlooked. Each is limited and conditioned by the\r\nother, though constitutional forms are always largely the product and\r\nexpression of economic conditions.\r\n\r\nIndividual liberty in any real sense implies much more than the\r\nrestriction of governmental authority. In fact, true liberty consists,\r\nas we have seen, not in divesting the government of effective power, but\r\nin making it an instrument for the unhampered expression and prompt\r\nenforcement of public opinion. The old negative conception of liberty\r\nwould in practice merely result in limiting the power of the government\r\nto control social conditions. This would not necessarily mean, however,\r\nthe immunity of the individual from external control. To limit the power\r\nof the government may permit the extension over the individual of some\r\nother form of control even more irresponsible than that of the\r\ngovernment itself--the control which inevitably results from the\r\neconomic supremacy of a class who own the land and the capital.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the factory system forced the great majority of\r\nsmall independent producers down into the ranks of mere wage-earners,\r\nand subjected them in their daily work to a class rule under which\r\neverything was subordinated to the controlling purpose of the\r\nemployers--the desire for profits.\r\n\r\nThe significance of this change from the old handicraft system of\r\nindustry to present-day capitalistic production is fully understood by\r\nall students of modern industry. Even Herbert Spencer, the great\r\nexpounder of individualism, admitted that the so-called liberty of the\r\nlaborer \"amounts in practice to little more than the ability to exchange\r\none slavery for another\" and that \"the coercion of circumstances often\r\nbears more hardly on him than the coercion of a master does on one in\r\nbondage.\"[180] This dependence of the laborer, however, he regarded as\r\nunfortunate, and looked forward to the gradual amelioration of present\r\nconditions through the growth of co-operation in production.\r\n\r\nIndividualism as an economic doctrine was advocated in the eighteenth\r\ncentury by those who believed in a larger measure of freedom for the\r\nindustrial classes. The small business which was then the rule meant the\r\nwide diffusion of economic power. A _laissez faire_ policy would have\r\nfurthered the interests of that large body of small independent\r\nproducers who had but little representation in and but little influence\r\nupon the government. It would have contributed materially to the\r\nprogress of the democratic movement by enlarging the sphere of\r\nindustrial freedom for all independent producers. It does not follow,\r\nhowever, that this doctrine which served a useful purpose in connection\r\nwith the eighteenth-century movement to limit the power of the ruling\r\nclass is sound in view of the political and economic conditions which\r\nexist to-day. The so-called industrial revolution has accomplished\r\nsweeping and far-reaching changes in economic organization. It has\r\nresulted in a transfer of industrial power from the many to the few, who\r\nnow exercise in all matters relating to production an authority as\r\nabsolute and irresponsible as that which the ruling class exercised in\r\nthe middle of the eighteenth century over the state itself. The simple\r\ndecentralized and more democratic system of production which formerly\r\nprevailed has thus been supplanted by a highly centralized and\r\nthoroughly oligarchic form of industrial organization. At the same time\r\npolitical development has been tending strongly in the direction of\r\ndemocracy. The few have been losing their hold upon the state, which has\r\ncome to rest, in theory at least, upon the wall of the many. A political\r\ntransformation amounting to a revolution has placed the many in the same\r\nposition in relation to the government which was formerly held by the\r\nfavored few.\r\n\r\nAs a result of these political and economic changes the policy of\r\ngovernment regulation of industry is likely to be regarded by the masses\r\nwith increasing favor. A society organized as a political democracy can\r\nnot be expected to tolerate an industrial aristocracy. As soon, then, as\r\nthe masses come to feel that they really control the political\r\nmachinery, the irresponsible power which the few now exercise in the\r\nmanagement of industry will be limited or destroyed as it has already\r\nbeen largely overthrown in the state itself. In fact the doctrine of\r\n_laissez faire_ no longer expresses the generally accepted view of state\r\nfunctions, but merely the selfish view of that relatively small class\r\nwhich, though it controls the industrial system, feels the reins of\r\npolitical control slipping out of its hands. The limitation of\r\ngovernmental functions which was the rallying-cry of the liberals a\r\ncentury ago has thus become the motto of the present-day conservative.\r\n\r\nThe opponents of government regulation of industry claim that it will\r\nretard or arrest progress by restricting the right of individual\r\ninitiative. They profess to believe that the best results for society as\r\na whole are obtained when every corporation or industrial combination is\r\nallowed to manage its business with a free hand. It is assumed by those\r\nwho advocate this policy that there is no real conflict of interests\r\nbetween the capitalists who control the present-day aggregations of\r\ncorporate wealth and the general public. No argument is needed, however,\r\nto convince any one familiar with the facts of recent industrial\r\ndevelopment that this assumption is not true.\r\n\r\nThe change in the attitude of the people toward the let-alone theory of\r\ngovernment is, as a matter of fact, the outcome of an intelligently\r\ndirected effort to enlarge and democratize--not abridge--the right of\r\ninitiative in its relation to the management of industry. The right of\r\nindividual initiative in the sense of the right to exercise a real\r\ncontrol over production was lost by the masses when the substitution of\r\nmachinery for tools made them directly dependent upon a class of\r\ncapital-owning employers. The subsequent growth of large scale\r\nproduction has centralized the actual control of industry in the hands\r\nof a small class of large capitalists. The small capitalists as\r\nseparate and independent producers are being rapidly crushed or absorbed\r\nby the great corporation. They may still belong to the capitalist class\r\nin that they live upon an income derived from the ownership of stock or\r\nbonds. But they have no real control over the business in which their\r\ncapital is invested. They no longer have the power to organize and\r\ndirect any part of the industrial process. They enjoy the benefits which\r\naccrue from the ownership of wealth, but they can no longer take an\r\nactive part in the management of industry. For them individual\r\ninitiative in the sense of an effective control over the industrial\r\nprocess has disappeared almost as completely as it has in the case of\r\nthe mere wage-earner. Individual initiative even for the capital-owning\r\nclass has thus largely disappeared. It has been superseded by corporate\r\ninitiative which means the extinguishment of individual initiative\r\nexcept in those cases where it is secured to the large capitalist\r\nthrough the ownership of a controlling interest in the business.\r\n\r\nThe abandonment of the _laissez faire_ policy, then, in favor of the\r\nprinciple of government regulation of industry is the outgrowth, not of\r\nany hostility to individual initiative, but of the conviction that the\r\nmonopoly of industrial power by the few is a serious evil. It is\r\nmanifestly impossible to restore to the masses the right of individual\r\ninitiative. Industry is too complex and too highly organized to permit a\r\nreturn to the old system of decentralized control. And since the only\r\nsubstitute for the old system of individual control is collective\r\ncontrol, it appears to be inevitable that government regulation of\r\nbusiness will become a fixed policy in all democratic states.\r\n\r\nThe _laissez faire_ policy is supposed to favor progress by allowing\r\nproducers to make such changes in business methods as may be prompted by\r\nthe desire for larger profits. The doctrine as ordinarily accepted\r\ncontains at least two erroneous assumptions, viz., (1) that any\r\ninnovation in production which makes it possible for the capitalist to\r\nsecure a larger return is necessarily an improvement in the sense of\r\naugmenting the average efficiency of labor, and (2) that policies are to\r\nbe judged solely by their economic effects. Even if non-interference\r\nresulted in industrial changes which in all cases increase the\r\nefficiency of labor, it would not follow that such changes are, broadly\r\nconsidered, always beneficial. Before drawing any sweeping conclusion we\r\nmust consider all the consequences direct and indirect, immediate and\r\nremote, political and social as well as economic. Hence the ordinary\r\ntest--the direct and immediate effect upon productive efficiency--is not\r\na satisfactory one. Moreover, many changes in the methods or\r\norganization of business are designed primarily to alter distribution in\r\nthe interest of the capitalist by decreasing wages or by raising\r\nprices. In so far as a policy of non-interference permits changes of\r\nthis sort, it is clearly harmful to the community at large, though\r\nadvantageous to a small class.\r\n\r\nIn all democratic countries the conservative classes are beginning to\r\nrealize that their ascendency in production is imperiled by the\r\nascendency of the masses in the state. It thus happens that in the hope\r\nof checking or retarding the movement toward regulation of business in\r\nthe interest of the people generally, they have taken refuge behind that\r\nabandoned tenet of democracy, the doctrine of non-interference.\r\n\r\nAt the same time they strongly favor any deviation from this policy\r\nwhich will benefit themselves. This is exemplified in their attitude in\r\nthis country toward our protective tariff system, which, as originally\r\nadopted, was designed to encourage the development of our national\r\nresources by offering the prospect of larger profit to those who would\r\ninvest their capital in the protected industries. Under a capitalistic\r\nsystem development naturally follows the line of greatest profit, and\r\nfor this reason any protective tariff legislation which did not augment\r\nthe profits of the capitalist would fail to accomplish its purpose. This\r\nwas recognized and frankly admitted when the policy was first adopted.\r\nLater, however, when the suffrage was extended and the laboring class\r\nbecame an important factor in national elections the champions of\r\nprotection saw that the system would have to be given a more democratic\r\ninterpretation. Thus the Whig platform of 1844 favored a tariff\r\n\"discriminating with special reference to the protection of the domestic\r\nlabor of the country.\" This was, however, the only political platform in\r\nwhich the labor argument was used until 1872, when the Republican party\r\ndemanded that \"duties upon importations ... should be so adjusted as to\r\naid in securing remunerative wages to labor, and promote the industries,\r\nprosperity, and growth of the whole country.\" Protection, since that\r\ntime, has been defended, not as a means of augmenting profits, but as a\r\nmeans of ensuring high wages to American workers. The interests of the\r\nwage-receiving class, however, were far from being the chief concern of\r\nthose who were seeking to maintain and develop the policy of protection.\r\nIt was to the capitalist rather than the wage-earner that the system of\r\nprotection as originally established made a direct appeal, and it was\r\nprimarily in the interest of this class that it was maintained even\r\nafter the labor argument came to be generally used in its defense. The\r\ncapitalist naturally favored a policy that would discourage the\r\nimportation of foreign goods and at the same time encourage the\r\nimportation of foreign labor. It was to his advantage to keep the labor\r\nmarket open to all who might wish to compete for employment, since this\r\nwould tend to force wages down and thus give him the benefit of high\r\nprices.\r\n\r\nAny system of protection established in the interest of labor would have\r\nexcluded all immigrants accustomed to a low standard of living. But as a\r\nmatter of fact the immigration of cheap foreign labor was actively\r\nencouraged by the employers in whose interest the high tariff on foreign\r\ngoods was maintained. The efforts of the wage-earning class to secure\r\nfor themselves some of the benefits of protection by organizing to\r\nobtain an advance or prevent a reduction in wages was largely defeated\r\nthrough the wholesale importation of cheap foreign labor by the large\r\nmanufacturing, mining and transportation companies. The agitation\r\nagainst this evil carried on by the labor unions finally resulted in the\r\nenactment by Congress of legislation forbidding the importation of labor\r\nunder contract of employment. This, however, did not, and even if it had\r\nbeen efficiently enforced, would not have given the American workingman\r\nany real protection against cheap foreign labor. The incoming tide of\r\nforeign immigration has been rising and the civic quality of the\r\nimmigrant has visibly declined. The free lands which formerly attracted\r\nthe best class of European immigrants are now practically a thing of the\r\npast, and with the disappearance of this opportunity for remunerative\r\nself-employment the last support of high wages has been removed. With\r\nunrestricted immigration the American laboring man must soon be deprived\r\nof any economic advantage which he has heretofore enjoyed over the\r\nlaboring classes of other countries.\r\n\r\nThere has been one notable exception to this immigration policy. The\r\ninvasion of cheap Asiatic labor upon the Pacific coast aroused a storm\r\nof protest from the laboring population, which compelled Congress to\r\npass the Chinese Exclusion Act. But this legislation, while shutting out\r\nChinese laborers, has not checked the immigration from other countries\r\nwhere a low standard of living prevails. In fact the most noticeable\r\nfeature of the labor conditions in this country has been the continual\r\ndisplacement of the earlier and better class of immigrants and native\r\nworkers by recent immigrants who have a lower standard of living and are\r\nwilling to work for lower wages. This has occurred, too, in some of the\r\nindustries in which the employer has been most effectually protected\r\nagainst the competition of foreign goods.[181]\r\n\r\nThe time has certainly arrived when the policy of protection ought to be\r\nmore broadly considered and dealt with in a public-spirited and\r\nstatesman-like manner. If it is to be continued as a national policy,\r\nthe interests of employees as well as employers must be taken into\r\naccount. The chief evils of the protective system have been due to the\r\nfact that it has been too largely a class policy, and while maintained\r\nin the interest of a class, it has been adroitly defended as a means of\r\nbenefiting the classes who derived little or no benefit--who were,\r\nindeed, often injured by our tariff legislation.\r\n\r\nThe large capitalist may grow eloquent in defense of that broad\r\nhumanitarian policy under which the weak, the oppressed, and the\r\nignorant of all nations are invited to come among us and share in the\r\neconomic and political opportunities and privileges of American\r\ncitizens. Such high-sounding and professedly disinterested\r\ncosmopolitanism appeals to a certain class of sentimental believers in\r\ndemocracy. It does not appeal, however, to any one who fully understands\r\npresent-day industrial and political conditions. This capitalistic\r\nsympathy for the weak and the oppressed of other nations may be regarded\r\nby some as the expression of a broader patriotism, but its tap-root is\r\nclass selfishness--the desire to secure high profits through maintaining\r\nactive competition among laborers. As a matter of fact, all legislation\r\ndoes, and always must, appeal to the interest of those without whose\r\ninfluence and support it could not be enacted, and nothing is ever\r\ngained for true progress by making the pretence of disinterested love\r\nfor humanity the cloak for class greed.\r\n\r\nThe desire of the employing class for cheap labor has been responsible\r\nfor the greatest dangers which menace this country to-day. It was the\r\ndemand for cheap labor which led to the importation of the African slave\r\nand perpetuated the institution of slavery until, with the voluntary\r\nimmigration of foreign labor, it was no longer an economic necessity\r\nfrom the standpoint of the employing class. Indeed the very existence of\r\nslavery, by discouraging immigration, tended to limit the supply of\r\nlabor, and by so doing, to cripple all enterprises in which free labor\r\nwas employed. In this sense the abolition of slavery was the result of\r\nan economic movement. It was to the advantage of the employing class as\r\na whole who found in the free labor hired under competitive conditions a\r\nmore efficient and cheaper instrument of production than the slave whom\r\nthey had to buy and for whose support they were responsible.\r\n\r\nHad it not been for this eagerness on the part of the employing class to\r\nsecure cheap labor at first through the importation of the African slave\r\nand later through the active encouragement of indiscriminate foreign\r\nimmigration, we would not now have the serious political, social and\r\neconomic problems which owe their existence to the presence among us of\r\nvast numbers of alien races who have little in common with the better\r\nclass of American citizens. This element of our population, while\r\nbenefiting the employing class by keeping wages down, has at the same\r\ntime made it more difficult to bring about that intelligent political\r\nco-operation so much needed to check the greed of organized wealth.\r\n\r\nThe limitation of governmental powers in the Constitution of the United\r\nStates was not designed to prevent all interference in business, but\r\nonly such as was conceived to be harmful to the dominant class. The\r\nnature of these limitations as well as the means of enforcing them\r\nindicate their purpose. The provision relating to direct taxes is a good\r\nexample. The framers of the Constitution were desirous of preventing any\r\nuse of the taxing power by the general government that would be\r\nprejudicial to the interests of the well-to-do classes. This is the\r\nsignificance of the provision that no direct taxes shall be laid unless\r\nin proportion to population.[182] The only kind of a direct tax which\r\nthe framers intended that the general government should have power to\r\nlevy was the poll tax which would demand as much from the poor man as\r\nfrom the rich. This was indeed one of the reasons for opposing the\r\nratification of the Constitution.\r\n\r\n\"Many specters,\" said Hamilton, \"have been raised out of this power of\r\ninternal taxation to excite the apprehensions of the people: double sets\r\nof revenue officers, a duplication of their burdens by double taxations,\r\nand the frightful forms of odious and oppressive poll-taxes, have been\r\nplayed off with all the ingenious dexterity of political legerdemain....\r\n\r\n\"As little friendly as I am to the species of imposition [poll-taxes], I\r\nstill feel a thorough conviction that the power of having recourse to it\r\nought to exist in the Federal government. There are certain emergencies\r\nof nations, in which expedients, that in the ordinary state of things\r\nought to be forborne, become essential to the public weal. And the\r\ngovernment, from the possibility of such emergencies, ought ever to have\r\nthe option of making use of them.\"[183]\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to observe that Hamilton's argument in defense of the\r\npower to levy poll-taxes would have been much more effective if it had\r\nbeen urged in support of the power to levy a direct tax laid in\r\nproportion to wealth. But this kind of a tax would, in the opinion of\r\nthe framers, have placed too heavy a burden upon the well-to-do. Hence\r\nthey were willing to deprive the general government of the power to levy\r\nit even at the risk of crippling it in some great emergency when there\r\nmight be urgent need of a large revenue.\r\n\r\nThis is not strange, however, when we remember that it was the\r\nproperty-owning class that framed and secured the adoption of the\r\nConstitution. That they had their own interests in view when they\r\nconfined the general government practically to indirect taxes levied\r\nupon articles of general consumption, and forbade direct taxes levied in\r\nproportion to wealth, seems highly probable. It appears, then, that the\r\nrecent decision of the United States Supreme Court declaring the Federal\r\nIncome Tax unconstitutional merely gave effect to the original spirit\r\nand purpose of this provision.\r\n\r\nThe disposition to guard the interests of the property-holding class\r\nrather than to prevent legislation for their advantage is also seen in\r\nthe interpretation which has been given to the provision forbidding the\r\nstates to pass any laws impairing the obligation of contracts. The\r\nframers of the Constitution probably did not have in mind the extended\r\napplication which the courts have since made of this limitation on the\r\npower of the states. Perhaps they intended nothing more than that the\r\nstates should be prevented from repudiating their just debts. But\r\nwhatever may have been the intention of the framers themselves, the\r\nreactionary movement in which they were the recognized leaders, finally\r\nbrought about a much broader and, from the point of view of the\r\ncapitalist class, more desirable interpretation of this provision.\r\n\r\nThere is evidence of a desire to limit the power of the states in this\r\ndirection even before the Constitutional Convention of 1787 assembled.\r\nThe legislature of Pennsylvania in 1785 passed a bill repealing an act\r\nof 1782 which granted a charter to the Bank of North America. James\r\nWilson, who is said to have suggested the above-mentioned clause of the\r\nFederal Constitution, made an argument against the repeal of the\r\ncharter, in which he claimed that the power, or at least the right of\r\nthe legislature, to modify or repeal did not apply to all kinds of\r\nlegislation. It could safely be exercised, he thought, in the case of \"a\r\nlaw respecting the rights and properties of all the citizens of the\r\nstate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very different,\" he says, \"is the case with regard to a law, by which\r\nthe state grants privileges to a congregation or other society.... Still\r\nmore different is the case with regard to a law by which an estate is\r\nvested or confirmed in an individual: if, in this case, the legislature\r\nmay, at discretion, and without any reason assigned, divest or destroy\r\nhis estate, then a person seized of an estate in fee-simple, under\r\nlegislative sanction, is, in truth, nothing more than a solemn tenant at\r\nwill....\r\n\r\n\"To receive the legislative stamp of stability and permanency, acts of\r\nincorporation are applied for from the legislature. If these acts may be\r\nrepealed without notice, without accusation, without hearing, without\r\nproof, without forfeiture, where is the stamp of their stability?... If\r\nthe act for incorporating the subscribers to the Bank of North America\r\nshall be repealed in this manner, a precedent will be established for\r\nrepealing, in the same manner, every other legislative charter in\r\nPennsylvania.... Those acts of the state, which have hitherto been\r\nconsidered as the sure anchors of privilege and of property, will become\r\nthe sport of every varying gust of politics, and will float wildly\r\nbackwards and forwards on the irregular and impetuous tides of party and\r\nfaction.\"[184]\r\n\r\nIn 1810 the case of Fletcher v. Peck[185] was decided in the Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States. Chief Justice Marshall, in delivering the\r\nopinion of the court, said:\r\n\r\n\"The principle asserted is that one legislature is competent to repeal\r\nany act which a former legislature was competent to pass; and that one\r\nlegislature can not abridge the powers of a succeeding legislature. The\r\ncorrectness of this principle, so far as respects general legislation,\r\ncan never be controverted. But if an act be done under a law, a\r\nsucceeding legislature can not undo it....\r\n\r\n\"When then a law is in the nature of a contract, when absolute rights\r\nhave vested under that contract, a repeal of the law can not devest\r\nthose rights; ...\r\n\r\n\"It may well be doubted whether the nature of society and of government\r\ndoes not prescribe some limits to the legislative power; ...\r\n\r\n\"It is, then, the unanimous opinion of the court, that, in this case,\r\nthe estate having passed into the hands of a purchaser for a valuable\r\nconsideration, without notice, the state of Georgia was restrained,\r\neither by general principles, which are common to our free institutions,\r\nor by the particular provisions of the Constitution of the United\r\nStates, from passing a law whereby the estate of the plaintiff in the\r\npremises so purchased could be constitutionally and legally impaired and\r\nrendered null and void.\"\r\n\r\nIt is evident from this opinion that the court would have been disposed\r\nat that time to declare state laws impairing property rights null and\r\nvoid, even if there had been nothing in the Constitution of the United\r\nStates to justify the exercise of such a power. Justice Johnson, in a\r\nseparate opinion, said:\r\n\r\n\"I do not hesitate to declare that a state does not possess the power of\r\nrevoking its own grants. But I do it on a general principle, on the\r\nreason and nature of things: a principle which will impose laws even on\r\nthe Deity....\r\n\r\n\"I have thrown out these ideas that I may have it distinctly understood\r\nthat my opinion on this point is not founded on the provision in the\r\nConstitution of the United States, relative to laws impairing the\r\nobligation of contracts.\"\r\n\r\nIt was contended in this case that the state of Georgia had the right to\r\nrevoke the grant on the ground that it was secured by corrupt means.\r\nThis argument evidently failed to appeal to the court. It was referred\r\nto by Justice Johnson who said \"as to the idea that the grants of a\r\nlegislature may be void because the legislature are corrupt, it appears\r\nto me to be subject to insuperable difficulties.... The acts of the\r\nsupreme power of a country must be considered pure....\"\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to observe that the Federalist judges in the early\r\nyears of our history under the Constitution did not deem it necessary to\r\nfind a constitutional ground for decisions of this sort. But with the\r\noverthrow of the Federalist party and the progress of belief in popular\r\ngovernment, there is an evident disposition on the part of the court to\r\nextend the protection of the Federal Constitution to all the powers\r\nwhich it claimed the right to exercise. Thus in the Dartmouth College\r\ncase, decided in 1819, the United States Supreme Court appears to have\r\nabandoned its earlier position and to have recognized the Constitution\r\nas the source of its power to annul state laws.\r\n\r\n\"It is under the protection of the decision in the Dartmouth College\r\ncase,\" says Judge Cooley, \"that the most enormous and threatening powers\r\nin our country have been created; some of the great and wealthy\r\ncorporations actually having greater influence in the country at large,\r\nand upon the legislation of the country than the states to which they\r\nowe their corporate existence. Every privilege granted or right\r\nconferred--no matter by what means or on what pretence--being made\r\ninviolable by the Constitution, the government is frequently found\r\nstripped of its authority in very important particulars, by unwise,\r\ncareless, or corrupt legislation; and a clause of the Federal\r\nConstitution, whose purpose was to preclude the repudiation of debts and\r\njust contracts, protects and perpetuates the evil.\"[186]\r\n\r\nAny government framed and set up to guard and promote the interests of\r\nthe people generally ought to have full power to modify or revoke all\r\nrights or privileges granted in disregard of the public welfare. But the\r\nSupreme Court, while permitting the creation or extension of property\r\nrights, has prevented the subsequent abridgment of such rights, even\r\nwhen the interests of the general public demanded it. The effect of this\r\nhas been to make the corporations take an active part in corrupting\r\nstate politics. Special legislation was not prohibited. In fact, it was\r\na common way of creating property rights. If a bank, an insurance\r\ncompany, or a railway corporation was organized, it was necessary to\r\nobtain a charter from the legislature which defined its powers and\r\nprivileges. The corporation came into existence by virtue of a special\r\nact of the legislature and could exercise only such powers and enjoy\r\nonly such rights and privileges as that body saw fit to confer upon it.\r\nThe legislature might refuse to grant a charter, but having granted it,\r\nit became a vested right which could not be revoked. The charter thus\r\ngranted by the legislature was a special privilege. In many instances it\r\nwas secured as a reward for political services by favorites of the party\r\nmachine, or through the corrupt expenditure of money or the equally\r\ncorrupt distribution of stock in the proposed corporation among those\r\nwho controlled legislation. Not only did this system invite corruption\r\nin the granting of such charters, but it also created a motive for the\r\nfurther use of corrupt means to keep possible competitors from securing\r\nlike privileges. It was worth the while to spend money to secure a\r\nvaluable privilege if when once obtained the legislature could not\r\nrevoke it. And it was also worth the while to spend more money to keep\r\ndangerous competitors out of the field if by so doing it could enjoy\r\nsome of the benefits of monopoly. By thus holding that a privilege\r\ngranted to an individual or a private corporation by special act of the\r\nlegislature was a contract which could not be revoked by that body, the\r\ncourts in their effort to protect property rights opened the door which\r\nallowed corporation funds to be brought into our state legislatures\r\nearly in our history for purposes of corruption.\r\n\r\nBut little attention has been given as yet to this early species of\r\ncorruption which in some of the states at least assumed the proportions\r\nof a serious political evil.\r\n\r\n\"During the first half century banking in New York,\" says Horace White,\r\n\"was an integral part of the spoils of politics. Federalists would grant\r\nno charters to Republicans, and Republicans none to Federalists. After a\r\nfew banks had been established they united, regardless of politics, to\r\ncreate a monopoly by preventing other persons from getting charters.\r\nWhen charters were applied for and refused, the applicants began\r\nbusiness on the common-law plan. Then, at the instigation of the favored\r\nones, the politicians passed a law to suppress all unchartered banks.\r\nThe latter went to Albany and bribed the legislature. In short,\r\npolitics, monopoly, and bribery constitute the key to banking in the\r\nearly history of the state.\"[187]\r\n\r\nThe intervention of the courts which made the conditions above described\r\npossible, while ostensibly limiting the power of the state legislature,\r\nin reality enlarged and extended it in the interest of the\r\ncapital-owning class. It gave to the state legislature a power which up\r\nto that time it had not possessed--the power to grant rights and\r\nprivileges of which the grantees could not be deprived by subsequent\r\nlegislation. Before the adoption of the Federal Constitution no act of\r\nthe legislature could permanently override the will of the qualified\r\nvoters. It was subject to modification or repeal at the hands of any\r\nsucceeding legislature. The voters of the state thus had what was in\r\neffect an indirect veto on all legislative acts--a power which they\r\nmight exercise through a subsequent legislature or constitutional\r\nconvention. But with the adoption of the Constitution of the United\r\nStates the Federal courts were able to deprive them of this power where\r\nit was most needed. This removed the only effective check on corruption\r\nand class legislation, thus placing the people at the mercy of their\r\nstate legislatures and any private interests that might temporarily\r\ncontrol them.\r\n\r\nThe power which the legislatures thus acquired to grant charters which\r\ncould not be amended or repealed made it necessary for the people to\r\ndevise some new method of protecting themselves against this abuse of\r\nlegislative authority. The outcome of this movement to re-establish some\r\neffective popular check on the legislature has taken the form in a\r\nmajority of the states of a constitutional amendment by which the right\r\nis reserved to amend or repeal all laws conferring corporate powers.\r\nSuch constitutional changes provide no remedy, however, for the evils\r\nresulting from legislative grants made previous to their adoption. The\r\ngranting of special charters is now also prohibited in many states, the\r\nconstitution requiring that all corporations shall be formed under\r\ngeneral laws. These constitutional changes may be regarded as in the\r\ninterest of the capitalist class as a whole, whose demand was for a\r\nbroader and more liberal policy--one which would extend the advantages\r\nof the corporate form of organization to all capitalists in every line\r\nof business. But even our general corporation laws have been enacted too\r\nlargely in the interest of those who control our business undertakings\r\nand without due regard to the rights of the general public.\r\n\r\nA study of our political history shows that the attitude of the courts\r\nhas been responsible for much of our political immorality. By protecting\r\nthe capitalist in the possession and enjoyment of privileges unwisely\r\nand even corruptly granted, they have greatly strengthened the motive\r\nfor employing bribery and other corrupt means in securing the grant of\r\nspecial privileges. If the courts had all along held that any proof of\r\nfraud or corruption in obtaining a franchise or other legislative grant\r\nwas sufficient to justify its revocation, the lobbyist, the bribe-giver,\r\nand the \"innocent purchaser\" of rights and privileges stolen from the\r\npeople, would have found the traffic in legislative favors a precarious\r\nand much less profitable mode of acquiring wealth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE INFLUENCE OF DEMOCRACY UPON THE CONSTITUTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe distinguishing feature of the Constitution, as shown in the\r\npreceding chapters of this book, was the elaborate provisions which it\r\ncontained for limiting the power of the majority. The direction of its\r\ndevelopment, however, has in many respects been quite different from\r\nthat for which the more conservative of its framers hoped.[188] The\r\nchecks upon democracy which it contained were nevertheless so skilfully\r\ncontrived and so effective that the progress of the popular movement has\r\nbeen more seriously hampered and retarded here than in any other country\r\nwhere the belief in majority rule has come to be widely accepted. In\r\nsome important respects the system as originally set up has yielded to\r\nthe pressure of present-day tendencies in political thought; but many of\r\nits features are at variance with what has come to be regarded as\r\nessential in any well-organized democracy.\r\n\r\nIt is not so much in formal changes made in the Constitution as in the\r\nchanges introduced through interpretation and usage that we must look\r\nfor the influence of nineteenth-century democracy. In fact, the formal\r\namendment of the Constitution, as shown in Chapter IV, is practically\r\nimpossible. But no scheme of government set up for eighteenth-century\r\nsociety could have survived throughout the nineteenth and into the\r\ntwentieth century without undergoing important modifications. No century\r\nof which we have any knowledge has witnessed so much progress along\r\nnearly every line of thought and activity. An industrial and social\r\nrevolution has brought a new type of society into existence and changed\r\nour point of view with reference to nearly every important economic and\r\npolitical question. Our constitutional and legal system, however, has\r\nstubbornly resisted the influence of this newer thought, although enough\r\nhas been conceded to the believers in majority rule from time to time to\r\nkeep the system of checks from breaking down.\r\n\r\nSome of the checks which the founders of our government established no\r\nlonger exist except in form. This is true of the electoral college\r\nthrough which the framers of the Constitution hoped and expected to\r\nprevent the majority of the qualified voters from choosing the\r\nPresident. In this case democracy has largely defeated the end of the\r\nframers, though the small states, through their disproportionately\r\nlarge representation in the electoral college, exert an influence in\r\nPresidential elections out of proportion to their population.\r\n\r\nThe most important change in the practical operation of the system has\r\nbeen accomplished indirectly through the extension of the suffrage in\r\nthe various states. Fortunately, the qualifications of electors were not\r\nfixed by the Federal Constitution. If they had been, it is altogether\r\nprobable that the suffrage would have been much restricted, since the\r\nright to vote was at that time limited to the minority. The state\r\nconstitutions responded in time to the influence of the democratic\r\nmovement and manhood suffrage became general. This placed not only the\r\nvarious state governments but also the President and the House of\r\nRepresentatives upon a basis which was popular in theory if not in fact.\r\nMuch remained and still remains to be done in the matter of perfecting\r\nthe party system and the various organs for formulating and expressing\r\npublic opinion with reference to political questions, before there will\r\nbe any assurance that even these branches of the general government will\r\nalways represent public sentiment.\r\n\r\nThere is one serious defect in the method of choosing the President. The\r\nsystem makes possible the election of an executive to whom a majority\r\nand even a large majority of the voters might be bitterly opposed. From\r\nthe point of view of the framers of the Constitution the choice of a\r\nmere popular favorite was undesirable and even dangerous; but according\r\nto the view now generally accepted the chief executive of the nation\r\nshould represent those policies which have the support of a majority of\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that the candidate receiving a majority of all the votes\r\ncast may be defeated,[189] while it often happens that the successful\r\ncandidate receives less than a majority of the popular vote.[190] When\r\nthree or more tickets are placed in the field, the candidate having a\r\nmajority in the electoral college may fall far short of a majority of\r\nthe popular vote. This was the case when Lincoln was elected President\r\nin 1860. There were four candidates for the Presidency, and while\r\nLincoln received a larger popular vote than any other one candidate, he\r\nreceived less than the combined vote for either Douglas and\r\nBreckenridge, or Douglas and Bell. In fact, he received less than\r\ntwo-fifths of the total popular vote.\r\n\r\nIt is easily seen that a system is fraught with grave danger, especially\r\nin times of bitter sectional and party strife, which makes possible the\r\nelection of a minority President. At such times opposition to\r\ngovernmental policies is most likely to assume the form of active\r\nresistance when a minority secures control of the government. In other\r\nwords, a majority is more likely to resist a minority than a minority is\r\nto resist a majority. This would be true especially in a country where\r\nthe people generally accept the principle of majority rule.\r\n\r\nIt can not be claimed that Lincoln was, or that the South regarded him\r\nas, the choice of a majority of the people. A different system which\r\nwould have precluded the election of a President who did not have a\r\nclear majority of the popular vote might have done much toward\r\ndiscouraging active resistance on the part of the Southern States.\r\n\r\nNo one, in fact, has stated the case against minority rule more clearly\r\nor forcefully than Lincoln himself. In a speech made in the House of\r\nRepresentatives January 12, 1848, on \"The War with Mexico,\" he said:\r\n\r\n\"Any people anywhere, being inclined and having the power, have the\r\n_right_ to rise up and shake off the existing government, and form a new\r\none that suits them better. This is a most valuable, a most sacred\r\nright--a right which, we hope and believe, is to liberate the world. Nor\r\nis this right confined to cases in which the whole people of an existing\r\ngovernment may choose to exercise it. Any portion of such people that\r\n_can may_ revolutionize, and make their _own_ of so much of the\r\nterritory as they inhabit. More than this, a _majority_ of any portion\r\nof such people may revolutionize, putting down a _minority_,\r\nintermingled with, or near about them, who may oppose their movements.\r\nSuch minority was precisely the case of the Tories of our own\r\nRevolution.\"[191]\r\n\r\nThis was quoted in defense of the right of secession by Alexander H.\r\nStephens in his \"Constitutional View of the Late War between the\r\nStates.\"[192]\r\n\r\nThe chief remaining obstacles to popular legislation are the Senate and\r\nthe Supreme Court. Some means must be found to make these two branches\r\nof the government responsible to the majority before the government as a\r\nwhole can be depended upon to give prompt and effective expression to\r\npublic opinion. The Senate presents the most difficult problem for\r\ndemocracy to solve. The present method of choosing senators is\r\naltogether unsatisfactory. It has resulted in making the upper house of\r\nour Federal legislature representative of those special interests over\r\nwhich there is urgent need of effective public control. It has also had\r\nthe effect of subordinating the making of laws in our state legislatures\r\nto that purely extraneous function--the election of United States\r\nsenators. The exercise of the latter function has done more than\r\nanything else to confuse state politics by making it necessary for those\r\ninterests that would control the United States Senate to secure the\r\nnomination and election of such men to the state legislatures as can be\r\nrelied upon to choose senators who will not be too much in sympathy with\r\nanti-corporation sentiments.\r\n\r\nThe Senate has fulfilled in larger measure than any other branch of the\r\ngovernment the expectation of the founders. It was intended to be\r\nrepresentative of conservatism and wealth and a solid and enduring\r\nbulwark against democracy. That it has accomplished this purpose of the\r\nframers can scarcely be denied. But the political beliefs of the framers\r\nare not the generally accepted political beliefs of to-day. It is\r\nimmaterial to the people generally that the attitude of the Senate on\r\npublic questions is in line with the purpose for which that body was\r\noriginally established. The criticism of the Senate's policy expressed\r\nin the phrase \"all brakes and no steam\"[193] indicates not so much a\r\nchange in the character and influence of that body as in the attitude of\r\nthe people toward the checks which the Constitution imposed upon\r\ndemocracy. Conservatism has always been characteristic of the United\r\nStates Senate, which, as Sir Henry Maine says, is \"the one thoroughly\r\nsuccessful institution [upper house] which has been established since\r\nthe tide of modern democracy began to run.\"[194] Measuring success by\r\nthe degree of resistance offered to the will of the majority, as this\r\nwriter does, the conclusion is correct. This is the standard of judgment\r\nwhich the framers of the Constitution would have applied, but it is not\r\nthe generally accepted standard according to which the success of that\r\nbody would be judged to-day. We have now come to accept the view that\r\nevery organ of government must be approved or condemned according as it\r\nfurthers or thwarts the ends of democracy. Applying this test, the\r\nconclusion is inevitable that the Senate as now constituted is out of\r\nharmony with present-day political thought.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, can be done to make that body an organ of democracy? There\r\nare three distinct evils in the Senate as it is now organized. The first\r\npertains to the irresponsibility of its members due to their method of\r\nelection and long term of office. But inasmuch as this could be remedied\r\nonly by a constitutional amendment, it is not likely that anything short\r\nof a revolutionary public sentiment in favor of such change could compel\r\nthe preliminary two-thirds majority in that body which the Constitution\r\nmakes necessary. A body made up of men who for the most part realize\r\nthat they owe their political advancement to a minority would naturally\r\nbe loth to support a change in the system which would place the election\r\nto membership in that body directly in the hands of the people. It is\r\nimprobable that any such reform can be accomplished at present. Any\r\nsuch direct attack upon the system would under present conditions be\r\nalmost certain to fail. Some method of accomplishing this object must be\r\nemployed which does not require the co-operation of the Senate, and\r\nwhich, without any constitutional amendment, really deprives the\r\nlegislature of the power to select United States Senators as the\r\nelectoral college has been deprived of all power in the choice of\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nThe second defect in the Senate is the equal representation of the\r\nstates in that body. It is not only absurd but manifestly unjust that a\r\nsmall state like Nevada should have as much representation in the\r\ncontrolling branch of Congress as New York with more than one hundred\r\nand seventy-one times as much population. A more inequitable\r\ndistribution of representation it would be difficult to imagine; yet\r\nthis evil could not be removed even by constitutional amendment, since\r\nthis matter does not come within the scope of the amending power, unless\r\nthe state or states affected by such proposed change should all give\r\ntheir assent.\r\n\r\nThe third defect in the Senate is the extraordinary power which the\r\nConstitution has conferred upon it. If it were a directly elected body\r\nwhose members were apportioned among the states according to population,\r\nthe overshadowing influence of the Senate would not be a serious\r\nmatter. But, as shown in Chapter VI, that body controls jointly with the\r\nPresident the appointing and the treaty-making power. Moreover, the\r\nlatter power may be exercised with reference to many things concerning\r\nwhich Congress has or could legislate. The Senate and the President may\r\nthus repeal what Congress has enacted. We thus have the peculiar\r\nsituation that a law enacted with the concurrence of the House may be\r\nrepealed without its consent, while a law which takes the form of a\r\ntreaty can not be repealed without the consent of the Senate.\r\n\r\nTheoretically, the Constitution could be amended so as to diminish the\r\npower of the Senate, but as a matter of fact no change in the\r\nConstitution would be more difficult to bring about. Any proposal to\r\nreduce the power of the Senate would jeopardize the prestige and\r\ninfluence of the smaller states no less than the proposal to deprive\r\nthem of equal representation in that body. The small states approach\r\npolitical equality with the large, just in proportion as the influence\r\nof the Senate is a dominating factor in the policy of the government.\r\nAny attack on this equality of representation would ally the small\r\nstates together in defense of this privilege, and make it impossible to\r\nobtain the assent of three-fourths of the states to any such change.\r\n\r\nThere is still another respect in which this equality of representation\r\nin the Senate is unfortunate. It tends to make it easier for\r\ncorporation influences to dominate that body. This arises out of the\r\nfact that it is more difficult and more expensive to control the\r\nelection of senators in a large than in a small state. This tends to\r\nmake the small states a favorite field for political activity on the\r\npart of those corporations which wish to secure or prevent Federal\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court is generally regarded as the most effective of all our\r\nconstitutional checks upon democracy. Still, if the Senate were once\r\ndemocratized, it would not be a difficult matter to bring the Federal\r\njudiciary into line with the popular movement. In fact, the means\r\nemployed in England to subordinate the House of Lords to the Commons\r\nindicates the method which might be employed here to subordinate the\r\nSupreme Court to Congress. The Ministry in England, virtually appointed\r\nby and responsible to the majority in the House of Commons, secured\r\ncontrol of the prerogatives of the Crown, one of which was the right to\r\nappoint peers. No sooner did the House of Commons come into possession\r\nof this power through a responsible Ministry than it realized the\r\npossibility of making use of it to overcome opposition to their policies\r\non the part of the Lords. If the House of Lords did not yield to the\r\nHouse of Commons, the latter, through its Cabinet, could create new\r\npeers in sufficient number to break down all resistance in that body.\r\nThe possession of that power by the Commons and the warning that it\r\nwould be used if necessary has been sufficient to ensure compliance on\r\nthe part of the Lords. In a similar manner Congress and the President\r\ncould control the Supreme Court. The Constitution does not fix the\r\nnumber of Supreme judges. This is a matter of detail which was left to\r\nCongress, which may at any time provide for the addition of as many new\r\njudges to the Supreme Court as it may see fit. Thus Congress, with the\r\nco-operation of the President, could control the policy of the Supreme\r\nCourt in exactly the same way and to the same extent that the House of\r\nCommons controls the House of Lords.\r\n\r\nThat the Federalists who were in possession of our general government\r\nduring the early years of its history appreciated the advantage of\r\ncontrolling the policy of the Supreme Court was pointed out in the\r\nchapter on the Federal judiciary. They accomplished their purpose,\r\nhowever, by selecting for membership in that body, men whose political\r\nrecord was satisfactory and whose views concerning judicial functions\r\nwere in harmony with the general plan and purpose of the Federalist\r\nparty. In fact, the scheme of government which they set up contemplated\r\nno such possibility as the democratization of the Executive or the\r\nSenate. If their expectation in this regard had been fully realized, a\r\njudicious use of the appointing power would have been all that was\r\nnecessary to ensure a conservative court. Perhaps the framers of the\r\nConstitution did not imagine that the power to increase the number of\r\njudges would ever be needed to enable the President and Senate to secure\r\nthe co-operation of the Supreme Court. At any rate, the power given to\r\nCongress and the President to enlarge the membership of that body was\r\nnot, in the opinion of the framers, a power that could ever be employed\r\nagainst the conservative class, since the radical element, it was\r\nbelieved, would never be able to control more than one branch of the\r\ngovernment, the House of Representatives. But, although it can not be\r\ndetermined whether the Federalists had in mind the possibility of using\r\nthis power to control the policy of the court, it should be noted that,\r\naccording to their view of the government, it might be used by, but not\r\nagainst, the conservative class. Nor is it likely that they would have\r\nhesitated to use this power had it been necessary to the success of\r\ntheir plan.\r\n\r\nThe failure of the Federalists to check the growth of democratic ideas\r\nand the success of the more liberal party in bringing about the election\r\nof Jefferson alarmed the conservative class. It was seen that if all\r\nother branches of the government should come under the influence of the\r\nliberal movement, the judicial check could be broken down. To guard\r\nagainst this danger, an effort was made by the conservative interests\r\nto mold a public sentiment that would protect the Supreme Court against\r\npolitical interference at the hands of those who might wish to override\r\njudicial opposition to radical measures. This took the form of what\r\nmight be called the doctrine of judicial infallibility. The judiciary in\r\ngeneral and the Supreme Court in particular were held up as the guardian\r\nand protector of American liberty. The security of the people was\r\nrepresented as bound up with the freedom of the courts from political\r\ninterference. At the same time it was proclaimed that the Supreme Court\r\nexercised only judicial functions and that any attempt on the part of\r\nthe President or Congress to interfere with them would make that body\r\nthe organ of faction or class. But, as a matter of fact, the danger\r\nwhich they foresaw to the Supreme Court was not a danger growing out of\r\nits judicial, but out of its legislative functions. It was not because\r\nthe Supreme Court was a purely judicial body, but because it exercised a\r\nsupremely important legislative function, that they were so solicitous\r\nto guard it against anything approaching popular control. The threefold\r\ndivision of governmental powers into legislative, executive, and\r\njudicial, as shown in a preceding chapter, has no logical basis. There\r\nare, as Professor Goodnow has said,[195] but two functions of\r\ngovernment, that of expressing and that of executing the will of the\r\nstate. The Supreme Court, in so far as it is a purely judicial\r\nbody--that is, a body for hearing and deciding cases--is simply a means\r\nof executing the will of the state. With the performance of this\r\nfunction there was little danger that any democratic movement would\r\ninterfere. Nor was this the danger which the conservative classes really\r\nfeared, or which they wished to guard against. What they desired above\r\nall else was to give the Supreme Court a final voice in expressing the\r\nwill of the state, and by so doing to make it operate as an effective\r\ncheck upon democratic legislation. It is this power of expressing the\r\nwill of the state which our conservative writers defend as the\r\npre-eminently meritorious feature of our judicial system. Indeed, this\r\nis, in the opinion of the conservative class, the most important of all\r\nthe checks on democracy. Any suggestion of using the power vested in\r\nCongress and the President to reorganize the Supreme Court is naturally\r\nenough denounced as the most dangerous and revolutionary of political\r\nheresies. It is not probable, however, that the Supreme Court would much\r\nlonger be permitted to thwart the will of the majority if the other\r\nbranches of the Federal government were thoroughly imbued with the\r\nbelief in democracy. As explained in Chapter V, the Constitution\r\ncontains no hint of this power to declare acts of Congress null and\r\nvoid. It was injected into the Constitution, as the framers intended, by\r\njudicial interpretation, and under the influence of a thoroughly\r\ndemocratic President, and Congress might be eliminated in the same way.\r\n\r\nThe most important feature of the Constitution from the standpoint of\r\ndemocracy is the provision contained in article V, requiring Congress\r\n\"on the application of the legislatures of two-thirds of the several\r\nstates\" to \"call a convention for proposing amendments.\" The progress of\r\ndemocracy in the various state governments is likely to compel resort to\r\nthis method of changing the Federal Constitution if the Senate much\r\nlonger persists in disregarding the will of the people. In fact, this\r\nis, in the opinion of the conservative class, the one fatal defect in\r\nthe scheme of constitutional checks established by our forefathers. It\r\nin reality opens the door to the most revolutionary changes in our\r\npolitical arrangements. Congress can not refuse to call a general\r\nconstitutional convention when two-thirds of the states demand it, and\r\nthis convention might propose an entirely new constitution framed in\r\naccord with the most advanced ideas of democracy. It might also follow\r\nthe precedent, set by the framers of our present Constitution and\r\nprescribe an entirely new method of ratification as our more\r\nconservative forefathers did when they disregarded the then existing\r\nprovision governing the amendment of the Articles of Confederation. It\r\nis true that they ignored the established method of amending as well as\r\nthe instructions from the states by which they were appointed, in order\r\nto bring about the adoption of a political system more acceptable to the\r\nconservative classes. But what has been done in the interest of the\r\nminority may also be done in the interest of the majority. A new Federal\r\nconstitution might be framed which would eliminate the whole system of\r\nchecks on the people and provide for direct ratification by a majority\r\nof the voters, as has already been done in the case of most of our state\r\nconstitutions. If the Constitution does not yield sufficiently to\r\nsatisfy the popular demand for reform, it is possible that the\r\nreactionary forces will, in their anxiety to defeat moderate democratic\r\nmeasures, arouse sufficient opposition on the part of the people to\r\ncompel sweeping constitutional changes.\r\n\r\nThe fact that two-thirds of the states can require Congress to call a\r\nconvention of all the states to propose changes in the Constitution is a\r\nmatter of no small importance. True, even this method of initiating\r\nchanges in the system would be very difficult, since the smaller states\r\nwould naturally fear an attempt to establish a more equitable plan of\r\nrepresentation, and the special and privileged interests of all sorts\r\nwhich have found the present system satisfactory would use every means\r\nat their command to prevent the states from resorting to this power. It\r\nis possible, if not indeed probable, that a serious and concerted\r\nattempt by the people to force changes in the Constitution by this\r\nmethod would sufficiently alarm the opponents of democracy to convince\r\nthem of the wisdom and expediency of such amendments as would appease\r\nthe popular clamor for reform without going too far in the direction of\r\nmajority rule. To prevent the complete overthrow of the system, which\r\nmight be the outcome if the states were compelled to assume the\r\ninitiative in amending the Constitution, the minority may accept the\r\ninevitable, and, choosing what appears to them to be the lesser of two\r\nevils, allow Congress to propose such amendments as the people are\r\ndetermined to bring about.\r\n\r\nIt is in the state and in the municipal governments, however, that the\r\ninfluence of democracy has been greatest. Yet even here much still\r\nremains to be done before the practical operation of the system will be\r\nin accord with the principle of majority rule. Direct election and\r\nuniversal suffrage have not under our scheme of checks and balances\r\nsecured any large measure of political responsibility. The logical\r\nresult of this system has been the growing distrust of public officials\r\nand especially of such representative bodies as state legislatures and\r\ncity councils. This lack of confidence in the local governmental\r\nmachinery, due to the irresponsibility of public officials, is certain\r\nto lead to the adoption of radical changes in the organization of our\r\nstate and municipal governments. Either the tenure of public officials\r\nwill be made to depend in some more effective way upon the will of the\r\nmajority, or the power which they now have and which they often use to\r\nfurther private interests at the expense of the people will be taken\r\nfrom them and conferred directly upon the majority of the voters.\r\n\r\nThe movement to give the people greater control over the officials whom\r\nthey have elected is really just beginning. Heretofore the effort to\r\nmake the government truly representative of the people has been mainly\r\nalong the line of broadening the suffrage and perfecting the method of\r\nvoting. This, the people are just beginning to realize, does not\r\nguarantee political responsibility. The secret ballot under present\r\nconditions is important, but it is by no means adequate. The right of\r\nthe majority to elect one or the other of two men, both of whom may have\r\nbeen nominated through the machinations of a corrupt and selfish\r\nminority, does not give the people any real control over the officials\r\nwhom they vote into office. What they need, to ensure responsibility, is\r\nthe power to make a real, not a merely nominal choice, coupled with the\r\npower to remove in case the person selected should lose the confidence\r\nof the majority.\r\n\r\nThe plan for depriving the minority of the power to control the\r\nselection of public officials, which is now rapidly gaining adherents\r\namong the advocates of political reform, is the direct primary. That\r\nsome such change in our method of nominating candidates is necessary to\r\nmake the so-called popular election of public officials anything more\r\nthan an empty form is apparent to any intelligent student of American\r\npolitics. But any proposal to deprive the minority of this power must\r\nencounter the determined opposition of the party machine and the various\r\nprivate interests which now prosper at the expense of the people. These\r\nopponents of political reform are continually declaiming against the\r\ncorruption and incapacity of the people and trying to make it appear\r\nthat a government can be no better than its source--those who elect the\r\npublic officials. That a government is not likely to be better than the\r\npeople whom it represents may be admitted. But this is aside from the\r\nquestion. Our present system in its practical operation is not a\r\ndemocracy. It is not truly representative, but misrepresentative. To\r\nprevent this evil--this betrayal of public trust in the interest of the\r\nminority--is the aim of the direct primary. That it will go far toward\r\nbreaking the power of the machine may be safely predicted, and that it\r\nwill be generally adopted as soon as the people realize its significance\r\nthere is scarcely room for doubt.\r\n\r\nBut while the direct nomination of candidates would doubtless go far\r\ntoward making public officials respect the wishes of the people, it\r\nwould not provide adequate protection against misconduct in office under\r\nour plan of election for a definite term without any effective power of\r\nremoval. A corrupt official may often find that by favoring private\r\ninterests at the expense of the people who have elected him, he can\r\nafford to forfeit all chance of re-election. The independence of public\r\nofficials which our forefathers were so anxious to secure has been found\r\nto be a fruitful source of corruption. A realization of this fact has\r\nbeen responsible for the introduction of the recall system under which\r\nthe people enforce official responsibility through their power to remove\r\nby a vote of lack of confidence in the form of a petition signed by a\r\ncertain percentage of the voters. Such an expression of popular\r\ndisapproval has the effect of suspending from office the offending\r\nofficial who can regain the office only by offering himself again as a\r\ncandidate at an election called for that purpose. This is as yet merely\r\nan innovation in municipal government, but if it proves to be\r\nsatisfactory, the principle will doubtless be incorporated, not only in\r\nmunicipal charters generally, but in our state constitutions as well.\r\n\r\nSimultaneous with this movement to make government really representative\r\nby enforcing official responsibility is another movement which also\r\naims to make the will of the majority supreme, but by a totally\r\ndifferent method of procedure. This is the movement looking toward the\r\nestablishment of the initiative and the referendum. Instead of leaving\r\npower in the hands of representative bodies and seeking to make them\r\nresponsible as the first plan of reform contemplates, the second plan\r\nwould guard representative bodies against temptation by divesting them\r\nof all powers which they are liable to misuse and conferring them\r\ndirectly upon the people. This is merely an attempt to get back to the\r\nbasic idea of the old town meeting, where local measures were directly\r\nproposed and adopted or rejected by the people. It is, moreover, the\r\nlogical outcome of the struggle which the advocates of majority rule\r\nhave been and are now making to secure control of our state and\r\nmunicipal governments. The constitutional checks on democracy have\r\ngreatly obstructed and delayed the progress of political reform. Some of\r\nthem have been removed, it is true, but enough still remain to make it\r\npossible for the minority to defeat the will of the majority with\r\nreference to many questions of vital importance.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted, when we review the course of our political\r\ndevelopment, that much progress has been made. But the evolution has\r\nbeen toward a direct rather than toward a representative democracy. The\r\nreason for this is not far to seek. The system of checks which limited\r\nthe power of the majority made the legislature largely an irresponsible\r\nbody; and since it could not be trusted, it was necessary to take out of\r\nits hands the powers it was most likely to abuse.\r\n\r\nThe legislature was first deprived of its power to enact constitutional\r\nlegislation, though it was allowed to retain an effective veto on such\r\nchanges through its refusal to take the initiative. With the progress of\r\nthe democratic movement some of the legislative powers most frequently\r\nabused were, like the state constitution itself, made subject to popular\r\nratification. This submission of constitutional and certain kinds of\r\nstatutory legislation to the people before it could go into effect\r\nmerely gave them to this extent a veto on the recommendations of their\r\nlegislatures and constitutional conventions. There was still no way to\r\nprevent the legislature from misrepresenting the people with respect to\r\nthose measures which did not require popular ratification. The tendency\r\nwas to diminish the power of the legislature by including in the\r\nconstitution itself much that might have taken the form of ordinary\r\nstatutory legislation, as well as by requiring that some of the more\r\nimportant acts passed by the legislature should receive the direct\r\nassent of the voters. This merely gave to the people a partial negative.\r\nIt enabled them to reject some measures which they did not approve of,\r\nbut not all, since in those cases where popular ratification was not\r\nrequired, public sentiment could be disregarded by the law-making body.\r\nMoreover, the people did not have the right to initiate measures--a\r\nright which is indispensable if the people are to have any real power to\r\nmold the policy of the state. The logical outcome of this line of\r\ndevelopment is easily seen. As pointed out in an earlier part of this\r\nvolume, constitutional development first limits and eventually destroys\r\nirresponsible power, and in the end makes the responsible power in the\r\nstate supreme. The prevalent lack of confidence in our state\r\nlegislatures is no indication of hostility to the principle of\r\nrepresentative government; for representative government in the true\r\nsense means government that is responsible to the people. The popular\r\nmovement has in modifying our state and municipal governments merely\r\ntaken the line of least resistance, and that has involved the transfer\r\nof legislative powers to the people themselves.\r\n\r\nJust how far this movement will go it is impossible to foresee. A\r\ngovernment of the representative type, if responsive to public\r\nsentiment, would answer all the requirements of a democratic state. It\r\nwould at the same time be merely carrying out in practice what has long\r\nbeen the generally accepted, if mistaken, view of our political system.\r\nThe adoption of some effective plan of direct nomination and recall of\r\nofficials would accomplish much in the way of restoring confidence in\r\nlegislative bodies. To this extent it would check the tendency to place\r\nthe law-making power directly in the hands of the people. Popular\r\nratification of all important laws would be unnecessary, if our\r\nlegislative bodies were really responsible to the people. Nevertheless,\r\nthe popular veto is a power which the people should have the right to\r\nuse whenever occasion demands. This would prevent the possibility of\r\nlegislation in the interest of the minority as now often happens. The\r\npopular veto through the referendum is not, however, of itself\r\nsufficient. The people need the power to initiate legislation as well as\r\nthe power to defeat it. The initiative combined with the referendum\r\nwould make the majority in fact, as it now is in name only, the final\r\nauthority in all matters of legislation.\r\n\r\nIt is in our state and municipal governments that democracy is likely to\r\nwin its first victories. The minority, however, will make a desperate\r\nstruggle to prevent the overthrow of the system which has been and still\r\nis the source of its power. The political machine supported by every\r\nprivileged interest will oppose by every means in its power the efforts\r\nof the people to break down the checks upon the majority. To this end we\r\nmust expect them to make large use in the near future, as they have in\r\nthe past, of the extraordinary powers exercised by our courts. In fact\r\nthe courts as the least responsible and most conservative of our organs\r\nof government have been the last refuge of the minority when defeated in\r\nthe other branches of the government. The disposition so generally seen\r\namong the opponents of democracy to regard all measures designed to\r\nbreak down the checks upon the majority as unconstitutional points to\r\nthe judiciary as the chief reliance of the conservative classes. Indeed,\r\nthe people are beginning to see that the courts are in possession of\r\npolitical powers of supreme importance--that they can, and often do,\r\ndefeat the will of the majority after it has successfully overcome\r\nopposition in all other branches of the government. If the will of the\r\nmajority is to prevail, the courts must be deprived of the power which\r\nthey now have to declare laws null and void. Popular government can not\r\nreally exist so long as judges who are politically irresponsible have\r\npower to override the will of the majority. The democratic movement will\r\neither deprive the judicial branch of the government of its political\r\npowers or subject it to the same degree of popular control applied to\r\nother political organs. The extension of direct nomination and recall to\r\nthe members of our state judiciary would deprive the special interests\r\nof the power to use the courts as the means of blocking the way to\r\npopular reforms. In any democratic community the final interpreter of\r\nthe constitution must be the majority. With the evolution of complete\r\npopular government, then, the judicial veto must disappear, or the\r\ncourt must become a democratic body.\r\n\r\nIt is through our state governments that we must approach the problem of\r\nreforming the national government. Complete control of the former will\r\nopen the door that leads to eventual control of the latter. Democratize\r\nthe state governments, and it will be possible even to change the\r\ncharacter of the United States Senate. With a state legislature directly\r\nnominated and subject to removal through the use of the recall, it will\r\nbe possible to deprive that body of any real power in the selection of\r\nUnited States senators. Under these conditions the legislature would\r\nmerely ratify the candidate receiving a majority of the popular vote\r\njust as the electoral college has come to ratify the popular choice of\r\nthe President. In this way direct nomination and direct election of\r\nUnited States senators could be made really effective while at the same\r\ntime preserving the form but not the substance of election by the state\r\nlegislatures.[196]\r\n\r\nThis would make possible that much needed separation of state and\r\nmunicipal from national politics. Candidates for the state legislature\r\nare now nominated and elected largely with reference to the influence of\r\nthat body upon the composition of the United States Senate. This has a\r\ntendency to, and in fact does, make state legislation in no small degree\r\na by-product of senatorial elections. By divesting the legislature of\r\nthis function, it would cease to be, as it is now, one of the organs of\r\nthe Federal government, and in assuming its proper role of a local\r\nlegislative body, it would become in fact what it has hardly been even\r\nin theory--a body mainly interested in formulating and carrying out\r\npurely local policies. Experience has shown beyond question that its\r\nfunction as an electoral college for the choice of United States\r\nsenators is incompatible with the satisfactory exercise of local\r\nlegislative functions. The latter will be sacrificed in the interest of\r\nthe former. This of itself is no small evil. For if there is any\r\nadvantage in our Federal form of government, it is in the opportunity\r\nthus provided for the faithful expression of local public opinion in\r\nlocal legislation. But in addition to this subordination of state to\r\nnational politics, which might be justified under existing conditions on\r\nthe ground that local measures and local interests should be sacrificed\r\nwhenever by so doing it would contribute to the success of the larger\r\nand more important matters of national policy, it has become a prolific\r\nsource of corruption.\r\n\r\nIt is not a mere accident that the United States Senate is to-day the\r\nstronghold of railway and other corporate interests. Possessing as it\r\ndoes more extended powers than the House of Representatives, it is for\r\nthat very reason the body in which every privileged interest will make\r\nthe greatest effort to obtain representation. Moreover, the indirect\r\nmethod of election is one that readily lends itself to purposes of\r\ncorruption. It is a notorious fact that it is much easier to buy the\r\nrepresentatives of the people than to buy the people themselves. Money\r\nexpended in influencing elections always has in view certain benefits\r\ndirect or indirect which those who contribute the funds for that purpose\r\nexpect to receive. Such funds invariably come in the main from special\r\ninterests which expect to get back from the people more than the amount\r\nof their political investments. If they had to deal with the people\r\ndirectly, the latter would demand an equivalent for any concession\r\ngranted, since it would not be to their advantage to enrich special\r\ninterests at their own expense. But where the concession can be granted\r\nby a small body such as a state legislature, the latter may find that it\r\nis to its advantage to co-operate with a selfish and unscrupulous class\r\nin furthering purely private interests at the expense of the public. The\r\nopportunity for the successful employment of corrupt means is greatly\r\naugmented, too, through the confusion of state and national issues under\r\nthe present system. Many measures may be sacrificed by the party in\r\ncontrol of the state legislature under the plea that it is necessary in\r\norder to advance the general interests of the party by the election of a\r\nUnited States senator. This possibility of evading responsibility for\r\nthe nonfulfillment of its duty as a local legislative body would\r\ndisappear as soon as it is deprived of the part which it now plays in\r\nthe choice of United States senators.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF THE TRANSITION FROM MINORITY TO MAJORITY RULE UPON MORALITY\r\n\r\n\r\nIn tracing the influence which the growth of democracy has had upon\r\nmorality, we should be careful to look below the surface of present-day\r\naffairs. The deeper and more enduring social movements and tendencies\r\nare not always obvious to the superficial observer. For this reason much\r\nthat has been written in recent years concerning our alleged decline in\r\npublic morality is far from convincing. Facts tending to show the\r\nprevalence of fraud and corruption in politics and business are not in\r\nthemselves sufficient to warrant any sweeping conclusions as to present\r\ntendencies. Paradoxical as it may seem, an increase in crime and other\r\nsurface manifestations of immorality, is no proof of a decline, but may\r\nas a matter of fact be merely a transient effect of substantial and\r\npermanent advance toward higher standards of morality.\r\n\r\nBefore making any comparison between the morality of two different\r\nperiods, we should first find out whether, in passing from the one\r\nperiod to the other, there has been any change in the accepted ideas of\r\nright and wrong. Now, if such is the case, it is manifestly an important\r\nfactor in the problem--one that should not be ignored; and yet this is\r\njust what many writers are doing who imagine that they are proving by\r\nstatistics a decline in morality. Their error consists in overlooking\r\nthe one fact of paramount importance, viz., that the accepted standard\r\nof morality has itself been raised. We are not judging conduct to-day\r\naccording to the ideas of civic duty in vogue a century, or even a\r\ngeneration ago. We are insisting upon higher standards of conduct both\r\nin politics and in business. Our ideas of right and wrong in their\r\nmanifold applications to social life have been profoundly changed, and\r\nin many respects for the better. We are trying to realize a new\r\nconception of justice. Many things which a century ago were sanctioned\r\nby law, or at least not forbidden, are no longer tolerated. Moreover,\r\nenlightened public opinion now condemns many things which have not yet\r\nbeen brought under the ban of the law.\r\n\r\nDuring any period, such as that in which we are now living, when society\r\nis rapidly assuming a higher ethical type, it is inevitable that much\r\nresistance should be made to the enforcement of the new standard of\r\njustice. Old methods of business and old political practices are not\r\neasily repressed, even when the public opinion of the community has come\r\nto regard them as socially injurious. Forms of conduct once permitted,\r\nbut now regarded as anti-social, tend to persist in spite of the effort\r\nof law and public opinion to dislodge them. The more rapid the ethical\r\nprogress of society, the more frequent and the more pronounced will be\r\nthe failure of the morally backward individuals to meet the requirements\r\nof the new social standard. At such a time we always see an increase in\r\ncrimes, misdemeanors and acts which enlightened public opinion condemns.\r\nThis is due, however, not to any decline in public morality, but to the\r\nfact that the ethical progress of society as a whole has been more rapid\r\nthan that of the offending class.\r\n\r\nThere is another source of error which we must guard against. Social\r\nimmorality is not always detected even when it exists. Much that is\r\nsocially immoral both in politics and in business escapes observation.\r\nNevertheless, the agencies for ferreting out and holding up to public\r\ncondemnation offences against society, are far more efficient and active\r\nto-day than they have ever been in the past. Both the corrupt public\r\nofficial and the unscrupulous business man dread the searchlight of\r\npublic opinion, which is becoming more and more effective as a regulator\r\nof conduct with the growth of intelligence among the masses. Nor is it\r\nsurprising that when the hitherto dark recesses of politics and business\r\nare exposed to view, an alarming amount of fraud and corruption should\r\nbe revealed. We are too prone to forget, however, that publicity is\r\nsomething new--that in our day the seen may bear a much larger\r\nproportion to the unseen than it has in the past. What appears, then, to\r\nbe an increase in business and political immorality may, after all, be\r\nlargely accounted for as the result of more publicity. Here, again, we\r\nsee that the facts usually taken to indicate a decline in public\r\nmorality are susceptible of a very different interpretation.\r\n\r\nAnother feature of present-day society which deserves careful\r\nconsideration by reason of its far-reaching effect upon public morality\r\nis the change now taking place in theological beliefs. Heretofore the\r\nchurch has been by far the most important agency for enforcing\r\nconformity to the accepted moral standard. The hope of reward or fear of\r\npunishment in the world to come has been the chief support upon which\r\nthe church has in the past rested its system of social control. But this\r\nother-world sanction is now losing its compelling force in consequence\r\nof the growing disbelief in the old doctrine of rewards and punishments.\r\nThe fear of the supernatural, which has its highest development in the\r\nsavage, steadily declines with the progress of the race. When the\r\ngeneral level of intelligence is low, the supernatural sanction is a far\r\nmore potent means of regulating conduct than any purely temporal\r\nauthority. But, just in proportion as society advances, the other-world\r\nsanction loses its potency and increasing reliance must, therefore, be\r\nplaced upon purely human agencies.\r\n\r\nThe immediate effect of this change in our attitude toward the hereafter\r\nand the supernatural has been to remove or at least to weaken an\r\nimportant restraint upon anti-social tendencies. There is no reason,\r\nhowever, for apprehension as to the final outcome. Society always\r\nexperiences some difficulty, it is true, in making the transition from\r\nthe old to the new. In every period of social readjustment old\r\ninstitutions and beliefs lose their efficacy before the new social\r\nagencies have been perfected. But if the new is higher and better than\r\nthe old, the good that will accrue to society will in the long run\r\ngreatly outweigh any temporary evil.\r\n\r\nBut great as has been the change in our point of view with reference to\r\nthe church, our attitude toward the state has been even more profoundly\r\nchanged. We do not have to go very far back into the past to find\r\ngovernment everywhere controlled by a king and privileged class. The\r\nascendency of the few was everywhere established by the sword, but it\r\ncould not be long maintained by force alone. The ignorance of the masses\r\nwas in the past, as it is now, the main reliance of those who wished to\r\nperpetuate minority rule. Fraud and deception have always been an\r\nindispensable means of maintaining class ascendency in government. The\r\nprimitive politician no less than his present-day successor saw the\r\npossibility of utilizing the credulity of the masses for the purpose of\r\nfurthering his own selfish ends. This explains the long-continued\r\nsurvival of that interesting political superstition which for so many\r\ncenturies protected class rule under the pretended sanction of a\r\nGod-given right.\r\n\r\nThe growth of intelligence among the masses by discrediting the doctrine\r\nof divine right made it necessary to abandon the old defense of class\r\nrule. From that time down to the present the disintegration of the old\r\npolitical order has been rapid. Every effort has been made by the\r\ndefenders of the old system to find some means of justifying and\r\nmaintaining class rule--a task which is becoming more and more difficult\r\nwith the growing belief in democracy. At the present time we are in a\r\ntransition stage. The divine theory of the state, which was the\r\nfoundation and support of the old system of class rule, is no longer\r\naccepted by intelligent people in any civilized country. But class rule\r\nstill has its advocates, even in the countries that have advanced\r\nfarthest in the direction of popular government. The opponents of\r\ndemocracy, however, comprise but a small part of the population\r\nnumerically, yet, owing to their great wealth and effective\r\norganization, their influence as a class is everywhere very great. Over\r\nagainst these is arrayed the bulk of the population, who are struggling,\r\nthough not very intelligently always, to overcome the opposition of the\r\nfew and make the political organization and the policy of the state a\r\ncomplete and faithful expression of the popular will. No modern state\r\nhas yet passed entirely through this transition stage. Everywhere the\r\nmovement toward democracy has been and is now being energetically\r\nresisted by those who fear that thoroughgoing popular government would\r\ndeprive them of economic or political privileges which they now enjoy.\r\nLet us not deceive ourselves by thinking that the old system of class\r\nrule has been entirely overthrown. No fundamental change in government\r\nor any other social institution ever comes about suddenly. Time, often\r\nmuch time, is required for those intellectual and moral readjustments\r\nwithout which no great change in social institutions can be made. And\r\nwhen we remember that only a century ago every government in the Western\r\nworld was avowedly organized on the basis of minority rule, we can\r\nreadily understand that society has not yet had sufficient time to\r\noutgrow the influence of the old political order.\r\n\r\nNo one can discuss intelligently the question of political morality if\r\nhe ignores the effect of this struggle between the old system of\r\nminority domination and the new system of majority rule. And yet\r\nscarcely ever do our text-books or magazine articles dealing with\r\npresent political evils even so much as allude to this most important\r\nfact--the one, indeed, on which hinges our whole system of business\r\nfraud and political corruption. We often hear the opinion expressed by\r\npeople of more than ordinary intelligence that the public immorality so\r\nmuch in evidence in this country is the natural and inevitable result of\r\npopular government. This view is industriously encouraged by the\r\nconservative and even accepted by not a few of those whose sympathies\r\nare with democracy. Yet no conclusion could be more erroneous. It would\r\nbe just as logical to attribute the religious persecutions of the Middle\r\nAges to the growth of religious dissent. If there had been no\r\ndissenters, there would have been no persecution; neither would there\r\nhave been any reformation or any progress toward a system of religious\r\nliberty. Persecution was the means employed to repress dissent and\r\ndefeat the end which the dissenters had in view. Corruption sustains\r\nexactly the same relation to the democratic movement of modern times. It\r\nhas been employed, not to promote, but to defeat the ends of popular\r\ngovernment. No intelligent person should any longer be in doubt as to\r\nthe real source of corruption. It is to be eradicated, not by placing\r\nadditional restrictions on the power of the people, but by removing\r\nthose political restraints upon the majority which now preclude any\r\neffective popular control of public officials. We forget that when our\r\ngovernment was established the principle of majority rule was nowhere\r\nrecognized--that until well along into the nineteenth century the\r\nmajority of our forefathers did not even have the right to vote. The\r\nminority governed under the sanction of the Constitution and the law of\r\nthe land. Then a great popular movement swept over the country, and in\r\nthe political upheaval which followed, the masses secured the right of\r\nsuffrage. But universal suffrage, though essential to, does not ensure\r\npopular government. The right to vote for some, or even all, public\r\nofficials, does not necessarily involve any effective control over such\r\nofficials by, or any real responsibility to, the majority of the voters.\r\nNor is any constitutional system set up to achieve the purpose of\r\nminority rule likely to contain those provisions which are necessary for\r\nthe enforcement of public opinion in the management of political\r\naffairs. It was thought by the masses, of course, when they acquired the\r\nsuffrage that they acquired the substance of political power. Their\r\nexpectation, however, was but partially realized. Indirect election,\r\nofficial independence, and the rigidity of the constitutional system as\r\na whole, with its lack of responsiveness to popular demands, largely\r\ncounteracted the results expected from universal suffrage. But the\r\nextension of the suffrage to the masses, though having much less direct\r\nand immediate influence upon the policy of the state than is generally\r\nsupposed, was in one respect supremely important. In popular thought it\r\nworked a transformation in the form of the government. The old view\r\nwhich recognized the political supremacy of the minority was now largely\r\nsuperseded by the new view that the will of the majority ought to be the\r\nsupreme law of the land.\r\n\r\nThe minority, however, still continue to exert a controlling influence\r\nin most matters of public policy directly affecting their interests as a\r\nclass, although the extension of the suffrage made the exercise of that\r\ncontrol a much more difficult matter and left little room for doubt that\r\nactual majority rule would ultimately prevail. A large measure of\r\nprotection was afforded them through the checks which the Constitution\r\nimposed upon the power of the majority. There was no certainty, however,\r\nthat these checks could be permanently maintained. A political party\r\norganized in the interest of majority rule, and supported by a strong\r\npublic sentiment, might find some way of breaking through or evading the\r\nconstitutional provisions designed to limit its power. Certain features\r\nof the Constitution, however, afforded excellent opportunities for\r\noffering effective resistance to the progress of democratic legislation.\r\nEntrenched behind these constitutional bulwarks, an active, intelligent\r\nand wealthy minority might hope to defeat many measures earnestly\r\ndesired by the majority and even secure the adoption of some policies\r\nthat would directly benefit themselves. Here we find the cause that has\r\nbeen mainly responsible for the growth of that distinctively American\r\nproduct, the party machine, with its political bosses, its army of paid\r\nworkers and its funds for promoting or opposing legislation, supplied by\r\nvarious special interests which expect to profit thereby. With the\r\npractical operation of this system we are all familiar. We see the\r\nresults of its work in every phase of our political life--in municipal,\r\nstate and national affairs. We encounter its malign influence every time\r\nan effort is made to secure any adequate regulation of railways, to\r\nprotect the people against the extortion of the trusts, or to make the\r\ngreat privileged industries of the country bear their just share of\r\ntaxation. But the chief concern of those in whose interest the party\r\nmachine is run is to defeat any popular attack on those features of the\r\nsystem which are the real source of the great power which the minority\r\nis able to exert. Try, for example, to secure a constitutional amendment\r\nproviding for the direct election of United States senators, the\r\nadoption of the initiative and the referendum, a direct primary scheme,\r\na measure depriving a city council of the power to enrich private\r\ncorporations by giving away valuable franchises, or any provision\r\nintended to give the people an effective control over their so-called\r\npublic servants, and we find that nothing less than an overwhelming\r\npublic sentiment and sustained social effort is able to make any headway\r\nagainst the small but powerfully entrenched minority.\r\n\r\nMany changes will be required before efficient democratic government can\r\nexist. The greatest and most pressing need at the present time, however,\r\nis for real publicity, which is the only means of making public opinion\r\neffective as an instrument of social control. The movement toward\r\npublicity has been in direct proportion to the growth of democracy.\r\nFormerly the masses were not regarded by the ruling class as having any\r\ncapacity for political affairs, or right to criticise governmental\r\npolicies and methods. With the acceptance of the idea of popular\r\nsovereignty, however, the right of the people to be kept informed\r\nconcerning the management of governmental business received recognition;\r\nbut practice has lagged far behind theory.\r\n\r\nMuch would be gained for good government by extending publicity to the\r\nrelations existing between public officials and private business\r\ninterests. This would discourage the corrupt alliance which now too\r\noften exists between unscrupulous politicians and corporate wealth. The\r\npublic have a right and ought to know to what extent individuals and\r\ncorporations have contributed money for the purpose of carrying\r\nelections. The time has come when the political party should be\r\ngenerally recognized and dealt with as a public agency--as an essential\r\npart or indispensable organ of the government itself. The amount of its\r\nrevenue, the sources from which it is obtained, the purposes for which\r\nit is expended, vitally concern the people and should be exposed to a\r\npublicity as thorough and searching as that which extends to the\r\nfinancial transactions of the government itself. The enforcement of\r\npublicity in this direction would not be open to the objection that the\r\ngovernment was invading the field of legitimate private activity, though\r\nit would bring to light the relations which now exist between the party\r\nmachine and private business, and in so doing would expose the true\r\nsource of much political corruption.\r\n\r\nBut this is not all that the people need to know concerning party\r\nmanagement. They can not be expected to make an intelligent choice of\r\npublic officials, unless they are supplied with all the facts which have\r\na direct bearing upon the fitness of the various candidates. Popular\r\nelections will not be entirely successful until some plan is devised\r\nunder which no man can become a candidate for office without expecting\r\nto have all the facts bearing upon his fitness, whether relating to his\r\nprivate life or official conduct, made public. Publicity of this sort\r\nwould do much toward securing a better class of public officials.\r\n\r\nPublicity concerning that which directly pertains to the management of\r\nthe government is not all that will be required. The old idea that all\r\nbusiness is private must give way to the new and sounder view that no\r\nbusiness is entirely private. It is true that the business world is not\r\nyet ready for the application of this doctrine, since deception is a\r\nfeature of present-day business methods. It is employed with reference\r\nto business rivals on the one hand and consumers on the other. This\r\npolicy of deception often degenerates into down-right fraud, as in the\r\ncase of secret rebates and other forms of discrimination through which\r\none competitor obtains an undue and perhaps crushing advantage over\r\nothers; or it may take the form of adulteration or other trade frauds by\r\nwhich the business man may rob the general public.\r\n\r\n\"Deception,\" says Lester F. Ward, \"may almost be called the foundation\r\nof business. It is true that if all business men would altogether\r\ndiscard it, matters would probably be far better even for them than they\r\nare; but, taking the human character as it is, it is frankly avowed by\r\nbusiness men themselves that no business could succeed for a single year\r\nif it were to attempt single-handed and alone to adopt such an\r\ninnovation. The particular form of deception characteristic of business\r\nis called _shrewdness_, and it is universally considered proper and\r\nupright. There is a sort of code that fixes the limit beyond which this\r\nform of deception must not be carried, and those who exceed that limit\r\nare looked upon somewhat as a pugilist who 'hits below the belt,' But\r\nwithin these limits every one expects every other to suggest the false\r\nand suppress the true, while _caveat emptor_ is lord of all, and 'the\r\ndevil take the hind-most.'\"[197]\r\n\r\nUnder this system the strong, the unscrupulous and the cunning may\r\npursue business tactics which enable them to accumulate wealth at the\r\nexpense of consumers or business rivals, but which, if generally known,\r\nwould not be tolerated. The great profits which fraudulent manufacturers\r\nand merchants have made out of adulterated goods would have been\r\nimpossible under a system which required that all goods should be\r\nproperly labeled and sold for what they really were. Such abuses as now\r\nexist in the management of railroads and other corporations could not,\r\nor at least would not long be permitted to exist, if the general public\r\nsaw the true source, character, extent and full effects of these evils.\r\n\r\nThe greatest obstacle to publicity at the present time is the control\r\nwhich corporate wealth is able to, and as a matter of fact does,\r\nexercise over those agencies upon which the people must largely depend\r\nfor information and guidance regarding contemporary movements and\r\nevents. The telegraph and the newspaper are indispensable in any\r\npresent-day democratic society. The ownership and unregulated control of\r\nthe former by the large corporate interests of the country, and the\r\ninfluence which they can bring to bear upon the press by this means, as\r\nwell as the direct control which they have over a large part of the\r\ndaily press by actual ownership, does much to hinder the progress of the\r\ndemocratic movement. This hold which organized wealth has upon the\r\nagencies through which public opinion is formed, is an important check\r\non democracy. It does much to secure a real, though not generally\r\nrecognized, class ascendency under the form and appearance of government\r\nby public opinion.\r\n\r\nThis great struggle now going on between the progressive and the\r\nreactionary forces, between the many and the few, has had a profound\r\ninfluence upon public morality. We have here a conflict between two\r\npolitical systems--between two sets of ethical standards. The supporters\r\nof minority rule no doubt often feel that the whole plan and purpose of\r\nthe democratic movement is revolutionary--that its ultimate aim is the\r\ncomplete overthrow of all those checks designed for the protection of\r\nthe minority. The only effective means which they could employ to retard\r\nthe progress of the popular movement involved the use of money or its\r\nequivalent in ways that have had a corrupting influence upon our\r\nnational life. Of course this need not, and as a rule does not, take the\r\ncoarse, crude form of a direct purchase of public officials. The methods\r\nused may in the main conform to all our accepted criteria of business\r\nhonesty, but their influence is none the less insidious and deadly. It\r\nis felt in many private institutions of learning; it is clearly seen in\r\nthe attitude of a large part of our daily press, and even in the church\r\nitself. This subtle influence which a wealthy class is able to exert by\r\nowning or controlling the agencies for molding public opinion is doing\r\nfar more to poison the sources of our national life than all the more\r\ndirect and obvious forms of corruption combined. The general public may\r\nnot see all this or understand its full significance, but the conviction\r\nis gaining ground that it is difficult to enact and still more difficult\r\nto enforce any legislation contemplating just and reasonable regulation\r\nof corporate wealth. The conservative classes themselves are not\r\nsatisfied with the political system as it now is, believing that the\r\nmajority, by breaking through restraints imposed by the Constitution,\r\nhave acquired more power than they should be permitted to exercise under\r\nany well-regulated government. It is but a step, and a short one at\r\nthat, from this belief that the organization of the government is wrong\r\nand its policy unjust, to the conclusion that one is justified in using\r\nevery available means of defeating the enactment or preventing the\r\nenforcement of pernicious legislation. On the other hand, the supporters\r\nof majority rule believe that the government is too considerate of the\r\nfew and not sufficiently responsive to the wishes of the many. As a\r\nresult of this situation neither the advocates nor the opponents of\r\nmajority rule have that entire faith in the reasonableness and justice\r\nof present political arrangements, which is necessary to ensure real\r\nrespect for, or even ready compliance with the laws.\r\n\r\nHere we find the real explanation of that widespread disregard of law\r\nwhich characterizes American society to-day. We are witnessing and\r\ntaking part in the final struggle between the old and the new--a\r\nstruggle which will not end until one or the other of these\r\nirreconcilable theories of government is completely overthrown, and a\r\nnew and harmonious political structure evolved. Every age of\r\nepoch-making change is a time of social turmoil. To the superficial\r\nonlooker this temporary relaxation of social restraints may seem to\r\nindicate a period of decline, but as a matter of fact the loss of faith\r\nin and respect for the old social agencies is a necessary part of that\r\nprocess of growth through which society reaches a higher plane of\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nDEMOCRACY OF THE FUTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe growth of the democratic spirit is one of the most important facts\r\nin the political life of the nineteenth century. All countries under the\r\ninfluence of Western civilization show the same tendency. New political\r\nideas irreconcilably opposed to the view of government generally\r\naccepted in the past are everywhere gaining recognition. Under the\r\ninfluence of this new conception of the state the monarchies and\r\naristocracies of the past are being transformed into the democracies of\r\nthe future. We of the present day, however, are still largely in the\r\ntrammels of the old, though our goal is the freedom of the new. We have\r\nnot yet reached, but are merely traveling toward democracy. The progress\r\nwhich we have made is largely a progress in thought and ideals. We have\r\nimbibed more of the spirit of popular government. In our way of\r\nthinking, our point of view, our accepted political philosophy, there\r\nhas been a marked change. Everywhere, too, with the progress of\r\nscientific knowledge and the spread of popular education, the masses are\r\ncoming to a consciousness of their strength. They are circumscribing\r\nthe power of ruling classes and abolishing their exclusive privileges\r\nwhich control of the state has made it possible for them to defend in\r\nthe past. From present indications we are at the threshold of a new\r\nsocial order under which the few will no longer rule the many.\r\n\r\nDemocracy may be regarded, according to the standpoint from which we\r\nview it, either as an intellectual or as a moral movement. It is\r\nintellectual in that it presupposes a more or less general diffusion of\r\nintelligence, and moral in that its aim is justice. It could not have\r\nappeared or become a social force until man became a thinker and critic\r\nof existing social arrangements. It was first necessary that he should\r\nacquire a point of view and a habit of thought that give him a measure\r\nof intellectual independence and enable him to regard social\r\ninstitutions and arrangements as human devices more or less imperfect\r\nand unjust. This thought can not be grasped without its correlative--the\r\npossibility of improvement. Hence democracy everywhere stands for\r\npolitical and social reform.\r\n\r\nDemocracy is modern, since it is only within recent times that the\r\ngeneral diffusion of knowledge has been possible. The invention of\r\nprinting, by making possible a cheap popular literature, contributed\r\nmore than any other one fact to the intellectual and moral awakening\r\nwhich marks the beginning of modern times. The introduction of\r\nprinting, however, did not find a democratic literature ready for\r\ngeneral distribution, or the people ready for its appearance. A long\r\nperiod of slow preparation followed, during which the masses were being\r\neducated. Moreover, it is only within recent times that governments\r\nwould have permitted the creation and diffusion of a democratic\r\nliterature. For a long time after printing was invented the ruling\r\nclasses carefully guarded against any use of the newly discovered art\r\nthat might be calculated to undermine their authority. Books containing\r\nnew and dangerous doctrines were rigorously proscribed and the people\r\ncarefully protected from the disturbing influence of such views as might\r\nshake their faith in the wisdom and justice of the existing social\r\norder.[198]\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps fortunate for the world that the political and social\r\nresults of printing were not comprehended at the time of its\r\nintroduction. Had the ruling classes foreseen that it would lead to the\r\ngradual shifting of political power from themselves to the masses, it is\r\nnot unlikely that they would have regarded it as a pernicious\r\ninnovation.\r\n\r\nBut, as is the case with all great inventions, its full significance was\r\nnot at first understood. Silently and almost imperceptibly it paved the\r\nway for a social and political revolution. The gradual diffusion of\r\nknowledge among the people prepared them for the contemplation of a new\r\nsocial order. They began to think, to question and to doubt, and\r\nthenceforth the power and prestige of the ruling classes began to\r\ndecline. From that time on there has been an unceasing struggle between\r\nthe privileged few and the unprivileged many. We see it in the peaceful\r\nprocess of legislation as well as in the more violent contest of war.\r\nAfter each success the masses have demanded still greater concessions,\r\nuntil now, with a broader outlook and a larger conception of human\r\ndestiny, they demand the complete and untrammeled control of the state.\r\n\r\nTo the student of political science, then, the spirit and temper, the\r\naims and ideals of the new social order now coming into existence, are a\r\nmatter of supreme importance. That our industrial system will be\r\nprofoundly modified may be conceded. Other consequences more difficult\r\nto foresee because less direct and immediate, but not necessarily less\r\nimportant, may be regarded as not unlikely. That our ideas of right and\r\nwrong, our conception of civic duty, and human character itself will be\r\nmodified as a result of such far-reaching changes in social relations,\r\nmay be expected. But while the more remote and indirect consequences of\r\ndemocracy may not be foreseen, some of its immediate results are\r\nreasonably certain.\r\n\r\nThe immediate aim of democracy is political. It seeks to overthrow every\r\nform of class rule and bring about such changes in existing governments\r\nas will make the will of the people supreme. But political reform is\r\nregarded not as an end in itself. It is simply a means. Government is a\r\ncomplex and supremely important piece of social machinery. Through it\r\nthe manifold activities of society are organized, directed and\r\ncontrolled. In a very real sense it is the most important of all social\r\ninstitutions, since from its very nature it is the embodiment of social\r\nforce, asserting and maintaining a recognized supremacy over all other\r\nsocial institutions and agencies whatever, modifying and adapting them\r\nto suit the purposes and achieve the ends of those who control the\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nThe form or type of government is all-important, since it involves the\r\nquestion as to the proper end of government as well as the proper means\r\nof attaining it. Our notion of what constitutes the best political\r\nsystem depends on our general theory of society--our conception of\r\njustice, progress and social well-being. As government by the few\r\ninevitably results in the welfare of the few being regarded as the chief\r\nconcern of the state, the widest possible diffusion of political power\r\nis the only guarantee that government will seek the welfare of the many.\r\n\r\nThe advocate of democracy does not think that it will be a perfect\r\ngovernment, but he does believe that it will in the long run be the\r\nbest, most equitable and most progressive which it is possible to\r\nestablish. Government by the few and government by the many stand for\r\nwidely divergent and irreconcilable theories of progress and social\r\nwell-being. As the methods, aims, and social ideals of an aristocracy\r\nare not those of which a democratic society would approve, it\r\nnecessarily follows that the purposes of democracy can be accomplished\r\nonly through a government which the people control.\r\n\r\nModern science has given a decided impetus to the democratic movement by\r\nmaking a comfortable existence possible for the many. It has explored\r\nthe depths of the earth and revealed hidden treasures of which previous\r\nages did not even dream. Inventions and discoveries far-reaching in\r\ninfluence and revolutionary in character have followed each other in\r\nrapid succession. With the progress of the sciences and mechanical arts,\r\nman's power to control and utilize the forces and materials which nature\r\nhas so bountifully provided has been enormously increased; and yet, much\r\nas has been accomplished in this field of human endeavor, there is\r\nreason to believe that the conquest of the material world has but just\r\nbegun. The future may hold in store for us far greater achievements\r\nalong this line than any the world has yet seen.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising, then, that the masses should feel that they have\r\nreceived too little benefit from this marvelous material progress. For\r\njust in proportion as the old political system has survived, with its\r\nprivileged classes, its checks on the people and its class ascendency in\r\ngovernment, the benefits of material progress have been monopolized by\r\nthe few. Against this intrusion of the old order into modern society the\r\nspirit of democracy revolts. It demands control of the state to the end\r\nthat the product of industry may be equitably distributed. As the\r\nuncompromising enemy of monopoly in every form, it demands first of all\r\nequality of opportunity.\r\n\r\nDemocracy, however, is not a mere scheme for the redistribution of\r\nwealth. It is fundamentally a theory of social progress. In so far as it\r\ninvolves the distribution of wealth, it does so as a necessary condition\r\nor means of progress, and not as an end in itself.\r\n\r\nDemocracy would raise government to the rank and dignity of a science by\r\nmaking it appeal to the reason instead of the fear and superstition of\r\nthe people. The governments of the past, basing their claims upon divine\r\nright, bear about the same relation to democracy that astrology and\r\nalchemy do to the modern sciences of astronomy and chemistry. The old\r\npolitical order everywhere represented itself as superimposed on man\r\nfrom above, and, thus clothed with a sort of divine sanction, it was\r\nexalted above the reach of criticism. The growth of intelligence has\r\ndispelled one by one the crude political superstitions upon which the\r\nold governmental arrangements rested. More and more man is coming to\r\nlook upon government as a purely human agency which he may freely modify\r\nand adapt to his purposes. The blind unthinking reverence with which he\r\nregarded it in the past is giving way to a critical scientific spirit.\r\nNor has this change in our point of view in any way degraded government.\r\nIn stripping it of the pretence of divine authority, it has in reality\r\nbeen placed upon a more enduring basis. In so far as it can no longer\r\nclaim respect to which it is not entitled we have a guarantee that it\r\ncan not persistently disregard the welfare of the people.\r\n\r\nDemocracy owes much to modern scientific research. With the advance of\r\nknowledge we have gained a new view of the world. Physics, astronomy,\r\nand geology have shown us that the physical universe is undergoing a\r\nprocess of continual change. Biology, too, has revolutionized our notion\r\nof life. Nothing is fixed and immutable as was once supposed, but change\r\nis universal. The contraction of the earth's crust with its resultant\r\nchanges in the distribution of land and water, and the continual\r\nmodification of climate and physical conditions generally have\r\nthroughout the past wrought changes in the form and character of all\r\nanimal and vegetable life. Every individual organism and every species\r\nmust change as the world around it changes, or death is the penalty. No\r\nform of life can long survive which does not possess in a considerable\r\ndegree the power of adaptation. Innumerable species have disappeared\r\nbecause of their inability to adjust themselves to a constantly changing\r\nenvironment. It is from this point of view of continuous adjustment that\r\nmodern science regards the whole problem of life individual and\r\ncollective.\r\n\r\nWe must not, however, assume that what is true of the lower forms of\r\nlife is equally true of the higher. In carrying the conceptions of\r\nbiology over into the domain of social science we must be careful to\r\nobserve that here the process of adapting life to its environment\r\nassumes a new and higher phase. In the lower animal world the\r\nlife-sustaining activities are individual. Division of labor is either\r\nentirely absent or plays a part so unimportant that we may for purposes\r\nof comparison assume its absence. The individual animal has free access\r\nto surrounding nature, unrestrained by social institutions or private\r\nproperty in the environment. For the members of a given group there is\r\nwhat may be described as equality of opportunity. Hence it follows that\r\nthe individuals which are best suited to the environment will thrive\r\nbest and will tend to crowd out the others.\r\n\r\nBut when we come to human society this is not necessarily true. Here a\r\nsocial environment has been created--a complex fabric of laws, usages,\r\nand institutions which envelopes completely the life of the individual\r\nand intervenes everywhere between him and physical nature. To this all\r\nhis industrial activities must conform. The material environment is no\r\nlonger the common possession of the group. It has become private\r\nproperty and has passed under the control of individuals in whose\r\ninterests the laws and customs of every community ancient and modern\r\nhave been largely molded. This is a fact which all history attests.\r\nWherever the few acquire a monopoly of political power it always tends\r\nto develop into a monopoly of the means and agents of production. Not\r\ncontent with making the physical environment their own exclusive\r\nproperty, the few have often gone farther and by reducing the many to\r\nslavery have established and legalized property in human beings\r\nthemselves. But even when all men are nominally free and legalized\r\ncoercion does not exist, the fact nevertheless remains that those who\r\ncontrol the means of production in reality control the rest. As Mr. W.H.\r\nMallock, the uncompromising opponent of democracy and staunch defender\r\nof aristocracy, puts it: \"The larger part of the progressive activities\r\nof peace, and the arts and products of civilization, result from and\r\nimply the influence of kings and leaders in essentially the same sense\r\nas do the successes of primitive war, the only difference being that the\r\nkings are here more numerous, and though they do not wear any arms or\r\nuniforms, are incomparably more autocratic than the kings and czars who\r\ndo.\"[199] \"Slavery, feudalism, and capitalism,\" he tells us, \"agree with\r\none another in being systems under which the few\"[200] control the\r\nactions of the many.\r\n\r\nThis feature of modern capitalism--the control of the many by the\r\nfew--which constitutes its chief merit in the eyes of writers like Mr.\r\nMallock is what all democratic thinkers consider its chief vice. Under\r\nsuch a system success or failure is no longer proof of natural fitness\r\nor unfitness. Where every advantage that wealth and influence afford is\r\nenjoyed by the few and denied to the many an essential condition of\r\nprogress is lacking. Many of the ablest, best, and socially fittest are\r\nhopelessly handicapped by lack of opportunity, while their inferiors\r\nequipped with every artificial advantage easily defeat them in the\r\ncompetitive struggle.\r\n\r\nThis lack of a just distribution of opportunity under existing\r\nindustrial arrangements, the defenders of the established social order\r\npersistently ignore. Taking no account of the unequal conditions under\r\nwhich the competitive struggle is carried on in human society, they\r\nwould make success proof of fitness to survive and failure evidence of\r\nunfitness. This is treating the complex problem of social adjustment as\r\nif it were simply a question of mere animal struggle for existence.\r\nWriters of this class naturally accept the Malthusian doctrine of\r\npopulation, and ascribe misery and want to purely natural causes, viz.,\r\nthe pressure of population on the means of subsistence. Not only is this\r\npressure with its attendant evils unavoidable, they tell us, but,\r\nregarded from the standpoint of the highest interests of the race it is\r\ndesirable and beneficent in that it is the method of evolution--the\r\nmeans which nature makes use of to produce, through the continual\r\nelimination of the weak, a higher human type. To relieve this pressure\r\nthrough social arrangements would arrest by artificial contrivances the\r\nprogress which the free play of natural forces tends to bring about. If\r\nprogress is made only through the selection of the fit and the rejection\r\nof the unfit, it would follow that the keener the struggle for existence\r\nand the more rapid and relentless the elimination of the weak, the\r\ngreater would be the progress made. This is exactly the contention of\r\nKidd in his Social Evolution. He claims that if the pressure of\r\npopulation on the means of subsistence were arrested, and all\r\nindividuals were allowed equally to propagate their kind, the human race\r\nwould not only not progress, but actually retrograde.[201] If we accept\r\nthis as true, it would follow that a high birth rate and a high death\r\nrate are necessary in order that the process of selection and rejection\r\nmay go on. This is indeed a pleasant prospect for all except the\r\nfortunate few. But the question, of course, is not whether this is\r\npleasant to contemplate or unpleasant, but whether it is true. Is the\r\nevolution of a higher human type the same kind of a process as that of a\r\nhigher animal or vegetable type? Is progress achieved only through the\r\npreservation of the fit and the elimination of the unfit? If it could be\r\nshown that this is the case, then certainly the conditions under which\r\nthis struggle to the death is carried on would be a matter of supreme\r\nimportance. Are our social adjustments such as to facilitate, or at\r\nleast not interfere with it? Do they make the question of success or\r\nfailure, survival or elimination, depend upon individual fitness or\r\nunfitness? This, as we have seen, is not the case, though the partisans\r\nof the biological theory of human progress have constantly assumed it.\r\nMr. Mallock takes even a more extreme position than most writers of this\r\nclass, and actually says \"that the social conditions of a time are the\r\nsame for all, but that it is only exceptional men who can make\r\nexceptional use of them.\"[202] The unequal distribution of wealth he\r\nseeks to justify on the ground that \"the ordinary man's talents as a\r\nproducer ... have not appreciably increased in the course of two\r\nthousand years and have certainly not increased within the past three\r\ngenerations.\"[203]\r\n\r\n\"In the domain of modern industrial activity the many\" ... he tells us,\r\n\"produce only an insignificant portion of the total, ... and in the\r\ndomain of intellectual and speculative progress the many produce or\r\nachieve nothing.\"[204] If we accept his premises, we must agree with\r\nhis conclusion that democracy's indictment of our modern industrial\r\nsystem falls to the ground. This view of the matter is acceptable, of\r\ncourse, to those who are satisfied with present social arrangements. It\r\nfurnishes a justification for the system under which they have prospered\r\nwhile others have failed. It relieves their conscience of any misgiving\r\nand soothes them with the assurance that only through the poverty and\r\nmisery of the unfit can a higher civilization be evolved. This largely\r\nexplains the popularity among the well-to-do classes of such books as\r\nMalthus' Principle of Population and Kidd's Social Evolution.\r\n\r\nSuch a treatment of the social problem, however, will not bear the test\r\nof analysis, since it assumes that the present distribution of\r\nopportunity is just. To ignore or treat as unimportant the influence of\r\nsocial arrangements upon the struggle for existence between individuals,\r\nas apologists for the existing social order are too much inclined to do,\r\nis like ignoring the modern battle-ship as a factor in the efficiency of\r\nthe modern navy.\r\n\r\nBut while this biological theory of evolution has been made to serve the\r\npurpose of defending existing social arrangements, it is in reality no\r\nadequate explanation of human progress. Selection and rejection do not,\r\nas a matter of fact, play any important part in the progress of\r\ncivilized communities. Here the struggle for existence has assumed the\r\nform of a struggle for domination. The vanquished are no longer\r\neliminated as a result of the competitive struggle; for, as Mr. Spencer\r\nsays, social institutions preserve the incapables.[205] Not only are the\r\nunsuccessful not eliminated but, as sociological students well know,\r\nthey increase more rapidly than the successful few. If, then, we accept\r\nthe biological theory of social evolution, we are forced to the\r\nconclusion that the human race, instead of advancing, is really\r\nretrograding. Seeing that this is not a satisfactory explanation of\r\nhuman progress, Mr. Mallock supplements it with a new factor which he\r\ndescribes as \"the unintended results of the intentions of great\r\nmen.\"[206] But, like all of these writers, he makes progress depend\r\nentirely on the biological struggle for existence or the industrial\r\nstruggle for supremacy, not recognizing the all-important part which\r\nsocial ideals and conscious social choice play in human evolution.\r\n\r\nThere is, then, as we have seen, ample justification for the hostility\r\nto privilege which the democratic movement everywhere exhibits. In\r\nmaking equality of opportunity a feature of the new social order, the\r\nadvocates of reform are proceeding in harmony with the teaching of\r\nmodern science. Such changes must be brought about in the organization\r\nof industry, the laws of property, the scope and character of public and\r\nprivate activities, as will sweep away entirely the whole ancient system\r\nof special privileges, and by placing all individuals upon the same\r\nfooting, make success the unfailing reward of merit. To accomplish this\r\nis to solve the monopoly problem. Some progress has been made in this\r\ndirection, but it consists for the most part in discovering that such a\r\nproblem exists. Just how posterity will deal with it, it is impossible\r\nto foresee; but of one thing we may be sure--this new conception of\r\njustice will exert a profound influence upon the legislation of the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nThe attention of the democratic movement has up to the present time been\r\noccupied almost exclusively with the question of a just distribution of\r\nopportunity; yet this is not the only problem which democracy will have\r\nto solve. Indeed, it is but the first step in a continuous process of\r\nconscious social readjustment. This fact many writers on social science\r\nhave not fully grasped. There is still a tendency to regard society as a\r\nsort of divinely ordered mechanism, which, if properly started, will\r\nautomatically work out the process of social evolution. * * * * From\r\nthis point of view it is easy to conclude that \"whatever is, is right.\"\r\n* * * * If we accept this belief in the beneficent and progressive\r\ncharacter of all natural processes, the conclusion is irresistible that\r\nnature's methods should not be interfered with.\r\n\r\nThis is largely the point of view of the earlier English political\r\neconomists, and it partly explains their belief in the policy of\r\nnon-interference. The best and most comprehensive statement of this view\r\nof social progress is found in Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations. In this\r\nwork he attempted to show that legislative interference with industry is\r\nunnecessary. Therefore he advocated the repeal of all laws which\r\ninterfered with or in any way restricted the liberty of the individual.\r\nHe believed that the natural principle of competition would of itself\r\neffectually regulate industrial life. The desire of each individual to\r\npursue his own interests made state interference, in his opinion,\r\nunnecessary. In the absence of legal restraints industrial matters would\r\nspontaneously regulate themselves. The varied economic activities of\r\nindividuals in society would be adequately controlled and harmonized\r\nwith the general interests of society, if statute or human law did not\r\ninterfere with natural or divine law. Reliance on competition would\r\nensure order, harmony and continuous progress in society, just as in the\r\nrealm of matter the influence of gravitation has transformed by a\r\nlong-continued development the original chaos into an orderly universe.\r\nEach individual acting in obedience to this law would be \"led by an\r\ninvisible hand to promote\"[207] the well-being of society, even though\r\nhe was conscious only of a selfish desire to further his own ends.\r\n\r\nSuch was the industrial philosophy of Adam Smith. It was in harmony with\r\nand the natural outcome of the movement which had already revolutionized\r\nreligious and philosophic thought. In every department of human activity\r\nemphasis was being put on the individual. Liberty was the watchword of\r\nsociety--the panacea for all social ills. The Western world was breaking\r\nthrough the old system of restraints under which the individual had been\r\nfettered in religion, politics and business. A new conception of the\r\nstate, its duties and its functions, had been evolved. Mere human law\r\nwas being discredited. Philosophers, distrusting the coercive\r\narrangements of society, were looking into the nature of man and the\r\ncharacter of the environment for the principles of social organization\r\nand order. Belief in the curative power of legislation was being\r\nsupplanted by a growing faith in the sufficiency of natural law.\r\n\r\nThe underlying motives for advocating the _laissez faire_ policy were,\r\nhowever, mainly political and economic.[208] The ready acceptance of\r\nthis doctrine must be attributed largely to the fact that it offered a\r\nplausible ground for opposing the burdensome restraints of the old\r\nsystem of class rule.\r\n\r\nThis is the origin of our modern doctrine of _laissez faire_ which has\r\nso profoundly influenced our political and economic life. But as\r\nmovements of this character are likely to do, it carried society too far\r\nin the opposite direction. This is recognized by that most eminent\r\nexpounder of the let-alone theory of government, Mr. Herbert Spencer,\r\nwho, in the third volume of his Principles of Sociology, admits that\r\n\"there has been a change from excess of restriction to deficiency of\r\nrestriction.\"[209] This means that in our accepted political and\r\neconomic philosophy we have overvalued the organizing power of\r\nunregulated natural law, and have consequently undervalued the state as\r\nan agency for controlling and organizing industrial forces.\r\n\r\nAll new ideas have to be harmonized with much that is old. As at first\r\naccepted they are only partially true. A new philosophy requires time\r\nbefore its benefits can be fully realized. It must pass through a\r\nprocess of adaptation by which it is gradually modified, broadened and\r\nbrought into orderly relations with life in general.\r\n\r\nThe theory of industrial freedom has during the nineteenth century been\r\npassing through just such a stage of development. The contention of Adam\r\nSmith and his followers that the mere desire for gain would of itself\r\nensure adequate regulation of industry is certainly not true under\r\nexisting conditions. Natural law is not, as he assumed, always\r\nbeneficent in its operation. It is just as liable to produce harm as\r\nbenefit unless it is regulated, controlled and directed by appropriate\r\nhuman agencies. It needs no argument to convince one that this is true\r\nso far as the forces of the physical world are concerned. Gravitation,\r\nsteam and electricity contributed nothing to human progress until man\r\ndiscovered the means whereby they could be harnessed and controlled.\r\nMaterial civilization means nothing else but the development of control\r\nover and the consequent utilization of the materials and forces of the\r\nphysical world. The important part played by mere human agencies is the\r\nonly feature that distinguishes civilization from barbarism. Everything\r\nwhich in any way contributes to material progress augments the power of\r\nman to control, modify and adapt his environment.\r\n\r\nAnd though it may not be so obvious, this general principle is just as\r\ntrue in the moral and spiritual world as in the physical. All progress,\r\nmaterial and moral, consists in the due subordination of natural to\r\nhuman agencies. Laws, institutions and systems of government are in a\r\nsense artificial creations, and must be judged in relation to the ends\r\nwhich they have in view. They are good or bad according as they are well\r\nor poorly adapted to social needs. Civilization in its highest sense\r\nmeans much more than the mere mastery of mind over inanimate nature; it\r\nimplies a more or less effective social control over individual conduct.\r\nCertain impulses, instincts and tendencies must be repressed; others\r\nmust be encouraged, strengthened, and developed.\r\n\r\nIt is a mistake to suppose that the unrestrained play of mere natural\r\nforces ensures progress. Occasional advance is the outcome, but so also\r\nis frequent retrogression. There is no scientific basis for the belief\r\nin a natural order that everywhere and always makes for progress.\r\nCompetition or the struggle for existence ensures at most merely the\r\nsurvival of the fittest; but survival of the fittest does not always\r\nmean survival of the best. Competition is nature's means of adapting\r\nlife to its environment. If the environment is such as to give the more\r\nhighly organized individuals the advantage, progress is the result. But\r\nif it is such as to place them at a disadvantage, retrogression, not\r\nprogress, is the outcome. The higher types of character, no less than\r\nthe higher organic forms, presuppose external conditions favorable to\r\ntheir development. Competition is merely the means through which\r\nconformity to these external conditions is enforced. It eliminates alike\r\nthat which is better than the environment and that which is worse. It is\r\nindifferent to good or bad, to high or low. It simply picks out,\r\npreserves and perpetuates those types best suited to environing\r\nconditions. Both progress and retrogression are a process of adaptation,\r\nand their cause must be sought, not in the principle of competition\r\nitself, but in the general external conditions to which it enforces\r\nconformity. Success, then, is a matter of adaptation to the environment,\r\nor the power to use it for individual ends--not the power to improve and\r\nenrich it. The power to take from, is nature's sole test of fitness to\r\nlive; but the power to enrich is a higher test, and one which society\r\nmust enforce through appropriate legislation.\r\n\r\nLaws, institutions and methods of trade which make it possible for the\r\nindividual to take from more than he adds to the general resources of\r\nsociety tend inevitably toward general social deterioration. Competition\r\nis wholesome only when all our social arrangements are such as to\r\ndiscourage and repress all individual activities not in harmony with the\r\ngeneral interests of society. This is the point of view from which all\r\nsocial and industrial questions must be studied. The problem which\r\ndemocracy has to solve is the problem of so organizing the environment\r\nas to assure progress through the success and survival of the best.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Sebohm, English Village Community, Ch.
