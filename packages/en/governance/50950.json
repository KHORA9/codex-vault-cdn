If\r\nyou haven't been personally affected by this recession, you probably\r\nknow someone who has: a friend, a neighbor, a member of your family.\r\nYou don't need to hear another list of statistics to know that our\r\neconomy is in crisis, because you live it every day. It's the worry you\r\nwake up with and the source of sleepless nights. It's the job you\r\nthought you'd retire from but now have lost, the business you built\r\nyour dreams upon that's now hanging by a thread, the college acceptance\r\nletter your child had to put back in the envelope. The impact of this\r\nrecession is real, and it is everywhere.\r\n\r\nBut while our economy may be weakened and our confidence shaken, though\r\nwe are living through difficult and uncertain times, tonight I want\r\nevery American to know this: We will rebuild, we will recover, and the\r\nUnited States of America will emerge stronger than before.\r\n\r\nThe weight of this crisis will not determine the destiny of this Nation.\r\nThe answers to our problems don't lie beyond our reach. They exist in\r\nour laboratories and our universities, in our fields and our factories,\r\nin the imaginations of our entrepreneurs and the pride of the hardest\r\nworking people on Earth. Those qualities that have made America the\r\ngreatest force of progress and prosperity in human history, we still\r\npossess in ample measure. What is required now is for this country to\r\npull together, confront boldly the challenges we face, and take\r\nresponsibility for our future once more.\r\n\r\nNow, if we're honest with ourselves, we'll admit that for too long, we\r\nhave not always met these responsibilities as a Government or as a\r\npeople. I say this not to lay blame or to look backwards, but because\r\nit is only by understanding how we arrived at this moment that we'll be\r\nable to lift ourselves out of this predicament.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, our economy did not fall into decline overnight, nor did\r\nall of our problems begin when the housing market collapsed or the\r\nstock market sank. We have known for decades that our survival depends\r\non finding new sources of energy, yet we import more oil today than\r\never before. The cost of health care eats up more and more of our\r\nsavings each year, yet we keep delaying reform. Our children will\r\ncompete for jobs in a global economy that too many of our schools do\r\nnot prepare them for. And though all these challenges went unsolved, we\r\nstill managed to spend more money and pile up more debt, both as\r\nindividuals and through our Government, than ever before.\r\n\r\nIn other words, we have lived through an era where too often short-term\r\ngains were prized over long-term prosperity, where we failed to look\r\nbeyond the next payment, the next quarter, or the next election. A\r\nsurplus became an excuse to transfer wealth to the wealthy instead of\r\nan opportunity to invest in our future. Regulations were gutted for the\r\nsake of a quick profit at the expense of a healthy market. People\r\nbought homes they knew they couldn't afford from banks and lenders who\r\npushed those bad loans anyway. And all the while, critical debates and\r\ndifficult decisions were put off for some other time, on some other day.\r\nWell, that day of reckoning has arrived, and the time to take charge of\r\nour future is here.\r\n\r\nNow is the time to act boldly and wisely to not only revive this\r\neconomy, but to build a new foundation for lasting prosperity. Now is\r\nthe time to jump-start job creation, restart lending, and invest in\r\nareas like energy, health care, and education that will grow our\r\neconomy, even as we make hard choices to bring our deficit down. That\r\nis what my economic agenda is designed to do, and that is what I'd like\r\nto talk to you about tonight. It's an agenda that begins with jobs.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I took office, I asked this Congress to send me a recovery\r\nplan by President's Day that would put people back to work and put\r\nmoney in their pockets, not because I believe in bigger Government--I\r\ndon't--not because I'm not mindful of the massive debt we've inherited-\r\n-I am. I called for action because the failure to do so would have cost\r\nmore jobs and caused more hardship. In fact, a failure to act would\r\nhave worsened our long-term deficit by assuring weak economic growth\r\nfor years. And that's why I pushed for quick action. And tonight I am\r\ngrateful that this Congress delivered and pleased to say that the\r\nAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act is now law.\r\n\r\nOver the next 2 years, this plan will save or create 3.5 million jobs.\r\nMore than 90 percent of these jobs will be in the private sector: jobs\r\nrebuilding our roads and bridges, constructing wind turbines and solar\r\npanels, laying broadband and expanding mass transit.\r\n\r\nBecause of this plan, there are teachers who can now keep their jobs\r\nand educate our kids, health care professionals can continue caring for\r\nour sick. There are 57 police officers who are still on the streets of\r\nMinneapolis tonight because this plan prevented the layoffs their\r\ndepartment was about to make. Because of this plan, 95 percent of\r\nworking households in America will receive a tax cut; a tax cut that\r\nyou will see in your paychecks beginning on April 1st. Because of this\r\nplan, families who are struggling to pay tuition costs will receive a\r\n$2,500 tax credit for all 4 years of college, and Americans who have\r\nlost their jobs in this recession will be able to receive extended\r\nunemployment benefits and continued health care coverage to help them\r\nweather this storm.\r\n\r\nNow, I know there are some in this Chamber and watching at home who are\r\nskeptical of whether this plan will work, and I understand that\r\nskepticism. Here in Washington, we've all seen how quickly good\r\nintentions can turn into broken promises and wasteful spending. And\r\nwith a plan of this scale comes enormous responsibility to get it right.\r\n\r\nAnd that's why I've asked Vice President Biden to lead a tough,\r\nunprecedented oversight effort; because nobody messes with Joe. I--am I\r\nright? They don't mess with him. I have told each of my Cabinet, as\r\nwell as mayors and Governors across the country, that they will be held\r\naccountable by me and the American people for every dollar they spend.\r\nI've appointed a proven and aggressive Inspector General to ferret out\r\nany and all cases of waste and fraud. And we have created a new web\r\nsite called recovery.gov, so that every American can find out how and\r\nwhere their money is being spent.\r\n\r\nSo the recovery plan we passed is the first step in getting our economy\r\nback on track. But it is just the first step. Because even if we manage\r\nthis plan flawlessly, there will be no real recovery unless we clean up\r\nthe credit crisis that has severely weakened our financial system.\r\n\r\nI want to speak plainly and candidly about this issue tonight, because\r\nevery American should know that it directly affects you and your\r\nfamily's well-being. You should also know that the money you've\r\ndeposited in banks across the country is safe, your insurance is secure,\r\nyou can rely on the continued operation of our financial system. That's\r\nnot the source of concern. The concern is that if we do not restart\r\nlending in this country, our recovery will be choked off before it even\r\nbegins.\r\n\r\nYou see, the flow of credit is the lifeblood of our economy. The\r\nability to get a loan is how you finance the purchase of everything\r\nfrom a home to a car to a college education, how stores stock their\r\nshelves, farms buy equipment, and businesses make payroll.\r\n\r\nBut credit has stopped flowing the way it should. Too many bad loans\r\nfrom the housing crisis have made their way onto the books of too many\r\nbanks. And with so much debt and so little confidence, these banks are\r\nnow fearful of lending out any more money to households, to businesses,\r\nor even to each other. And when there is no lending, families can't\r\nafford to buy homes or cars, so businesses are forced to make layoffs.\r\nOur economy suffers even more, and credit dries up even further. That\r\nis why this administration is moving swiftly and aggressively to break\r\nthis destructive cycle, to restore confidence, and restart lending. And\r\nwe will do so in several ways.\r\n\r\nFirst, we are creating a new lending fund that represents the largest\r\neffort ever to help provide auto loans, college loans, and small-\r\nbusiness loans to the consumers and entrepreneurs who keep this economy\r\nrunning.\r\n\r\nSecond, we have launched a housing plan that will help responsible\r\nfamilies facing the threat of foreclosure lower their monthly payments\r\nand refinance their mortgages. It's a plan that won't help speculators\r\nor that neighbor down the street who bought a house he could never hope\r\nto afford, but it will help millions of Americans who are struggling\r\nwith declining home values; Americans who will now be able to take\r\nadvantage of the lower interest rates that this plan has already helped\r\nto bring about. In fact, the average family who refinances today can\r\nsave nearly $2,000 per year on their mortgage.\r\n\r\nThird, we will act with the full force of the Federal Government to\r\nensure that the major banks that Americans depend on have enough\r\nconfidence and enough money to lend even in more difficult times. And\r\nwhen we learn that a major bank has serious problems, we will hold\r\naccountable those responsible, force the necessary adjustments, provide\r\nthe support to clean up their balance sheets, and assure the continuity\r\nof a strong, viable institution that can serve our people and our\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\nNow, I understand that on any given day, Wall Street may be more\r\ncomforted by an approach that gives bank bailouts with no strings\r\nattached and that holds nobody accountable for their reckless decisions.\r\nBut such an approach won't solve the problem, and our goal is to\r\nquicken the day when we restart lending to the American people and\r\nAmerican business and end this crisis once and for all.\r\n\r\nAnd I intend to hold these banks fully accountable for the assistance\r\nthey receive, and this time, they will have to clearly demonstrate how\r\ntaxpayer dollars result in more lending for the American taxpayer. This\r\ntime, CEOs won't be able to use taxpayer money to pad their paychecks\r\nor buy fancy drapes or disappear on a private jet. Those days are over.\r\n\r\nStill, this plan will require significant resources from the Federal\r\nGovernment--and, yes, probably more than we've already set aside. But\r\nwhile the cost of action will be great, I can assure you that the cost\r\nof inaction will be far greater, for it could result in an economy that\r\nsputters along for not months or years, but perhaps a decade. That\r\nwould be worse for our deficit, worse for business, worse for you, and\r\nworse for the next generation. And I refuse to let that happen.\r\n\r\nNow, I understand that when the last administration asked this Congress\r\nto provide assistance for struggling banks, Democrats and Republicans\r\nalike were infuriated by the mismanagement and the results that\r\nfollowed. So were the American taxpayers; so was I. So I know how\r\nunpopular it is to be seen as helping banks right now, especially when\r\neveryone is suffering in part from their bad decisions. I promise you,\r\nI get it.\r\n\r\nBut I also know that in a time of crisis, we cannot afford to govern\r\nout of anger or yield to the politics of the moment. My job--our job is\r\nto solve the problem. Our job is to govern with a sense of\r\nresponsibility. I will not send--I will not spend a single penny for\r\nthe purpose of rewarding a single Wall Street executive, but I will do\r\nwhatever it takes to help the small business that can't pay its workers\r\nor the family that has saved and still can't get a mortgage. That's\r\nwhat this is about. It's not about helping banks; it's about helping\r\npeople. [Applause]\r\n\r\nIt's not about helping banks; it's about helping people. Because when\r\ncredit is available again, that young family can finally buy a new home.\r\nAnd then some company will hire workers to build it. And then those\r\nworkers will have money to spend. And if they can get a loan too, maybe\r\nthey'll finally buy that car or open their own business. Investors will\r\nreturn to the market, and American families will see their retirement\r\nsecured once more. Slowly but surely, confidence will return and our\r\neconomy will recover.\r\n\r\nSo I ask this Congress to join me in doing whatever proves necessary,\r\nbecause we cannot consign our Nation to an open-ended recession. And to\r\nensure that a crisis of this magnitude never happens again, I ask\r\nCongress to move quickly on legislation that will finally reform our\r\noutdated regulatory system. It is time to put in place tough, new,\r\ncommonsense rules of the road so that our financial market rewards\r\ndrive and innovation, and punishes shortcuts and abuse.\r\n\r\nThe recovery plan and the financial stability plan are the immediate\r\nsteps we're taking to revive our economy in the short term. But the\r\nonly way to fully restore America's economic strength is to make the\r\nlong-term investments that will lead to new jobs, new industries, and a\r\nrenewed ability to compete with the rest of the world. The only way\r\nthis century will be another American century is if we confront at last\r\nthe price of our dependence on oil and the high cost of health care,\r\nthe schools that aren't preparing our children and the mountain of debt\r\nthey stand to inherit. That is our responsibility.\r\n\r\nIn the next few days, I will submit a budget to Congress. So often,\r\nwe've come to view these documents as simply numbers on a page or a\r\nlaundry list of programs. I see this document differently. I see it as\r\na vision for America, as a blueprint for our future.\r\n\r\nMy budget does not attempt to solve every problem or address every\r\nissue. It reflects the stark reality of what we've inherited, a\r\ntrillion-dollar deficit, a financial crisis, and a costly recession.\r\nGiven these realities, everyone in this Chamber, Democrats and\r\nRepublicans, will have to sacrifice some worthy priorities for which\r\nthere are no dollars. And that includes me. But that does not mean we\r\ncan afford to ignore our long-term challenges. I reject the view that\r\nsays our problems will simply take care of themselves, that says\r\nGovernment has no role in laying the foundation for our common\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\nFor history tells a different story. History reminds us that at every\r\nmoment of economic upheaval and transformation, this Nation has\r\nresponded with bold action and big ideas. In the midst of Civil War, we\r\nlaid railroad tracks from one coast to another that spurred commerce\r\nand industry. From the turmoil of the Industrial Revolution came a\r\nsystem of public high schools that prepared our citizens for a new age.\r\nIn the wake of war and depression, the GI bill sent a generation to\r\ncollege and created the largest middle class in history. And a twilight\r\nstruggle for freedom led to a nation of highways, an American on the\r\nMoon, and an explosion of technology that still shapes our world. In\r\neach case, Government didn't supplant private enterprise; it catalyzed\r\nprivate enterprise. It created the conditions for thousands of\r\nentrepreneurs and new businesses to adapt and to thrive.\r\n\r\nWe are a nation that has seen promise amid peril and claimed\r\nopportunity from ordeal. Now we must be that nation again, and that is\r\nwhy, even as it cuts back on programs we don't need, the budget I\r\nsubmit will invest in the three areas that are absolutely critical to\r\nour economic future: energy, health care, and education.\r\n\r\nIt begins with energy. We know the country that harnesses the power of\r\nclean, renewable energy will lead the 21st century. And yet, it is\r\nChina that has launched the largest effort in history to make their\r\neconomy energy efficient. We invented solar technology, but we've\r\nfallen behind countries like Germany and Japan in producing it. New\r\nplug-in hybrids roll off our assembly lines, but they will run on\r\nbatteries made in Korea. Well, I do not accept a future where the jobs\r\nand industries of tomorrow take root beyond our borders, and I know you\r\ndon't either. It is time for America to lead again.\r\n\r\nThanks to our recovery plan, we will double this Nation's supply of\r\nrenewable energy in the next 3 years. We've also made the largest\r\ninvestment in basic research funding in American history, an investment\r\nthat will spur not only new discoveries in energy but breakthroughs in\r\nmedicine and science and technology.\r\n\r\nWe will soon lay down thousands of miles of power lines that can carry\r\nnew energy to cities and towns across this country. And we will put\r\nAmericans to work making our homes and buildings more efficient so that\r\nwe can save billions of dollars on our energy bills.\r\n\r\nBut to truly transform our economy, to protect our security, and save\r\nour planet from the ravages of climate change, we need to ultimately\r\nmake clean, renewable energy the profitable kind of energy. So I ask\r\nthis Congress to send me legislation that places a market-based cap on\r\ncarbon pollution and drives the production of more renewable energy in\r\nAmerica. That's what we need. And to support that innovation, we will\r\ninvest $15 billion a year to develop technologies like wind power and\r\nsolar power, advanced biofuels, clean coal, and more efficient cars and\r\ntrucks built right here in America.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of our auto industry, everyone recognizes that years of bad\r\ndecisionmaking and a global recession have pushed our automakers to the\r\nbrink. We should not, and will not, protect them from their own bad\r\npractices. But we are committed to the goal of a retooled, reimagined\r\nauto industry that can compete and win. Millions of jobs depend on it;\r\nscores of communities depend on it. And I believe the Nation that\r\ninvented the automobile cannot walk away from it.\r\n\r\nNow, none of this will come without cost, nor will it be easy. But this\r\nis America. We don't do what's easy. We do what's necessary to move\r\nthis country forward.\r\n\r\nAnd for that same reason, we must also address the crushing cost of\r\nhealth care. This is a cost that now causes a bankruptcy in America\r\nevery 30 seconds. By the end of the year, it could cause 1.5 million\r\nAmericans to lose their homes. In the last 8 years, premiums have grown\r\nfour times faster than wages. And in each of these years, 1 million\r\nmore Americans have lost their health insurance. It is one of the major\r\nreasons why small businesses close their doors and corporations ship\r\njobs overseas. And it's one of the largest and fastest growing parts of\r\nour budget. Given these facts, we can no longer afford to put health\r\ncare reform on hold. We can't afford to do it. It's time.\r\n\r\nAlready, we've done more to advance the cause of health care reform in\r\nthe last 30 days than we've done in the last decade. When it was days\r\nold, this Congress passed a law to provide and protect health insurance\r\nfor 11 million American children whose parents work full time. Our\r\nrecovery plan will invest in electronic health records, a new\r\ntechnology that will reduce errors, bring down costs, ensure privacy,\r\nand save lives. It will launch a new effort to conquer a disease that\r\nhas touched the life of nearly every American, including me, by seeking\r\na cure for cancer in our time. And it makes the largest investment ever\r\nin preventive care, because that's one of the best ways to keep our\r\npeople healthy and our costs under control.\r\n\r\nThis budget builds on these reforms. It includes a historic commitment\r\nto comprehensive health care reform, a down payment on the principle\r\nthat we must have quality, affordable health care for every American.\r\nIt's a commitment that's paid for in part by efficiencies in our system\r\nthat are long overdue. And it's a step we must take if we hope to bring\r\ndown our deficit in the years to come.\r\n\r\nNow, there will be many different opinions and ideas about how to\r\nachieve reform, and that's why I'm bringing together businesses and\r\nworkers, doctors and health care providers, Democrats and Republicans\r\nto begin work on this issue next week.\r\n\r\nI suffer no illusions that this will be an easy process. Once again, it\r\nwill be hard. But I also know that nearly a century after Teddy\r\nRoosevelt first called for reform, the cost of our health care has\r\nweighed down our economy and our conscience long enough. So let there\r\nbe no doubt: Health care reform cannot wait, it must not wait, and it\r\nwill not wait another year.\r\n\r\nThe third challenge we must address is the urgent need to expand the\r\npromise of education in America. In a global economy where the most\r\nvaluable skill you can sell is your knowledge, a good education is no\r\nlonger just a pathway to opportunity, it is a prerequisite. Right now,\r\nthree-quarters of the fastest growing occupations require more than a\r\nhigh school diploma. And yet, just over half of our citizens have that\r\nlevel of education. We have one of the highest high school dropout\r\nrates of any industrialized nation, and half of the students who begin\r\ncollege never finish.\r\n\r\nThis is a prescription for economic decline, because we know the\r\ncountries that out-teach us today will outcompete us tomorrow. That is\r\nwhy it will be the goal of this administration to ensure that every\r\nchild has access to a complete and competitive education, from the day\r\nthey are born to the day they begin a career. That is a promise we have\r\nto make to the children of America.\r\n\r\nAlready, we've made historic investment in education through the\r\neconomic recovery plan. We've dramatically expanded early childhood\r\neducation and will continue to improve its quality, because we know\r\nthat the most formative learning comes in those first years of life.\r\nWe've made college affordable for nearly 7 million more students--7\r\nmillion. And we have provided the resources necessary to prevent\r\npainful cuts and teacher layoffs that would set back our children's\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nBut we know that our schools don't just need more resources, they need\r\nmore reform. And that is why this budget creates new teachers--new\r\nincentives for teacher performance, pathways for advancement, and\r\nrewards for success. We'll invest in innovative programs that are\r\nalready helping schools meet high standards and close achievement gaps,\r\nand we will expand our commitment to charter schools.\r\n\r\nIt is our responsibility as lawmakers and as educators to make this\r\nsystem work. But it is the responsibility of every citizen to\r\nparticipate in it. So tonight I ask every American to commit to at\r\nleast 1 year or more of higher education or career training. This can\r\nbe community college or a 4-year school, vocational training or an\r\napprenticeship. But whatever the training may be, every American will\r\nneed to get more than a high school diploma.\r\n\r\nAnd dropping out of high school is no longer an option. It's not just\r\nquitting on yourself, it's quitting on your country, and this country\r\nneeds and values the talents of every American. That's why we will\r\nsupport--we will provide the support necessary for all young Americans\r\nto complete college and meet a new goal. By 2020, America will once\r\nagain have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world.\r\nThat is a goal we can meet. That's a goal we can meet.\r\n\r\nNow, I know that the price of tuition is higher than ever, which is why\r\nif you are willing to volunteer in your neighborhood or give back to\r\nyour community or serve your country, we will make sure that you can\r\nafford a higher education. And to encourage a renewed spirit of\r\nnational service for this and future generations, I ask Congress to\r\nsend me the bipartisan legislation that bears the name of Senator Orrin\r\nHatch, as well as an American who has never stopped asking what he can\r\ndo for his country, Senator Edward Kennedy.\r\n\r\nThese education policies will open the doors of opportunity for our\r\nchildren, but it is up to us to ensure they walk through them. In the\r\nend, there is no program or policy that can substitute for a parent,\r\nfor a mother or father who will attend those parent-teacher conferences\r\nor help with homework or turn off the TV, put away the video games,\r\nread to their child. I speak to you not just as a President, but as a\r\nfather, when I say that responsibility for our children's education\r\nmust begin at home. That is not a Democratic issue or a Republican\r\nissue; that's an American issue.\r\n\r\nThere is, of course, another responsibility we have to our children.\r\nAnd that's the responsibility to ensure that we do not pass on to them\r\na debt they cannot pay. That is critical. [Applause] I agree,\r\nabsolutely. See, I know we can get some consensus in here. [Laughter]\r\nWith the deficit we inherited, the cost of the crisis we face, and the\r\nlong-term challenges we must meet, it has never been more important to\r\nensure that as our economy recovers, we do what it takes to bring this\r\ndeficit down. That is critical.\r\n\r\nNow, I'm proud that we passed a recovery plan free of earmarks, and I\r\nwant to pass a budget next year that ensures that each dollar we spend\r\nreflects only our most important national priorities.\r\n\r\nAnd yesterday I held a fiscal summit where I pledged to cut the deficit\r\nin half by the end of my first term in office. My administration has\r\nalso begun to go line by line through the Federal budget in order to\r\neliminate wasteful and ineffective programs. As you can imagine, this\r\nis a process that will take some time. But we have already identified\r\n$2 trillion in savings over the next decade.\r\n\r\nIn this budget, we will end education programs that don't work and end\r\ndirect payments to large agribusiness that don't need them. We'll\r\neliminate the no-bid contracts that have wasted billions in Iraq and\r\nreform our defense budget so that we're not paying for cold war-era\r\nweapons systems we don't use. We will root out the waste and fraud and\r\nabuse in our Medicare program that doesn't make our seniors any\r\nhealthier. We will restore a sense of fairness and balance to our Tax\r\nCode by finally ending the tax breaks for corporations that ship our\r\njobs overseas.\r\n\r\nIn order to save our children from a future of debt, we will also end\r\nthe tax breaks for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans. Now, let me\r\nbe clear--let me be absolutely clear, because I know you'll end up\r\nhearing some of the same claims that rolling back these tax breaks\r\nmeans a massive tax increase on the American people: If your family\r\nearns less than $250,000 a year, a quarter million dollars a year, you\r\nwill not see your taxes increased a single dime. I repeat: Not one\r\nsingle dime. In fact--not a dime--in fact, the recovery plan provides a\r\ntax cut--that's right, a tax cut--for 95 percent of working families.\r\nAnd by the way, these checks are on the way.\r\n\r\nNow, to preserve our long-term fiscal health, we must also address the\r\ngrowing costs in Medicare and Social Security. Comprehensive health\r\ncare reform is the best way to strengthen Medicare for years to come.\r\nAnd we must also begin a conversation on how to do the same for Social\r\nSecurity, while creating tax-free universal savings accounts for all\r\nAmericans.\r\n\r\nFinally, because we're also suffering from a deficit of trust, I am\r\ncommitted to restoring a sense of honesty and accountability to our\r\nbudget. That is why this budget looks ahead 10 years and accounts for\r\nspending that was left out under the old rules. And for the first time,\r\nthat includes the full cost of fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. For 7\r\nyears, we have been a nation at war. No longer will we hide its price.\r\n\r\nAlong with our outstanding national security team, I'm now carefully\r\nreviewing our policies in both wars, and I will soon announce a way\r\nforward in Iraq that leaves Iraq to its people and responsibly ends\r\nthis war.\r\n\r\nAnd with our friends and allies, we will forge a new and comprehensive\r\nstrategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan to defeat Al Qaida and combat\r\nextremism, because I will not allow terrorists to plot against the\r\nAmerican people from safe havens halfway around the world. We will not\r\nallow it.\r\n\r\nAs we meet here tonight, our men and women in uniform stand watch\r\nabroad and more are readying to deploy. To each and every one of them\r\nand to the families who bear the quiet burden of their absence,\r\nAmericans are united in sending one message: We honor your service; we\r\nare inspired by your sacrifice; and you have our unyielding support.\r\n\r\nTo relieve the strain on our forces, my budget increases the number of\r\nour soldiers and marines. And to keep our sacred trust with those who\r\nserve, we will raise their pay and give our veterans the expanded\r\nhealth care and benefits that they have earned.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo overcome extremism, we must also be vigilant in upholding the values\r\nour troops defend, because there is no force in the world more powerful\r\nthan the example of America. And that is why I have ordered the closing\r\nof the detention center at Guantanamo Bay and will seek swift and\r\ncertain justice for captured terrorists. Because living our values\r\ndoesn't make us weaker, it makes us safer and it makes us stronger. And\r\nthat is why I can stand here tonight and say without exception or\r\nequivocation that the United States of America does not torture. We can\r\nmake that commitment here tonight.\r\n\r\nIn words and deeds, we are showing the world that a new era of\r\nengagement has begun. For we know that America cannot meet the threats\r\nof this century alone, but the world cannot meet them without America.\r\nWe cannot shun the negotiating table, nor ignore the foes or forces\r\nthat could do us harm. We are instead called to move forward with the\r\nsense of confidence and candor that serious times demand.\r\n\r\nTo seek progress towards a secure and lasting peace between Israel and\r\nher neighbors, we have appointed an envoy to sustain our effort. To\r\nmeet the challenges of the 21st century--from terrorism to nuclear\r\nproliferation, from pandemic disease to cyber threats to crushing\r\npoverty--we will strengthen old alliances, forge new ones, and use all\r\nelements of our national power.\r\n\r\nAnd to respond to an economic crisis that is global in scope, we are\r\nworking with the nations of the G-20 to restore confidence in our\r\nfinancial system, avoid the possibility of escalating protectionism,\r\nand spur demand for American goods in markets across the globe. For the\r\nworld depends on us having a strong economy, just as our economy\r\ndepends on the strength of the world's.\r\n\r\nAs we stand at this crossroads of history, the eyes of all people in\r\nall nations are once again upon us, watching to see what we do with\r\nthis moment, waiting for us to lead. Those of us gathered here tonight\r\nhave been called to govern in extraordinary times. It is a tremendous\r\nburden, but also a great privilege, one that has been entrusted to few\r\ngenerations of Americans. For in our hands lies the ability to shape\r\nour world for good or for ill.\r\n\r\nI know that it's easy to lose sight of this truth, to become cynical\r\nand doubtful, consumed with the petty and the trivial. But in my life,\r\nI have also learned that hope is found in unlikely places, that\r\ninspiration often comes not from those with the most power or celebrity,\r\nbut from the dreams and aspirations of ordinary Americans who are\r\nanything but ordinary.\r\n\r\nI think of Leonard Abess, a bank president from Miami who reportedly\r\ncashed out of his company, took a $60 million bonus, and gave it out to\r\nall 399 people who worked for him, plus another 72 who used to work for\r\nhim. He didn't tell anyone, but when the local newspaper found out, he\r\nsimply said, \"I knew some of these people since I was 7 years old. It\r\ndidn't feel right getting the money myself.\"\r\n\r\nI think about Greensburg, Kansas, a town that was completely destroyed\r\nby a tornado, but is being rebuilt by its residents as a global example\r\nof how clean energy can power an entire community, how it can bring\r\njobs and businesses to a place where piles of bricks and rubble once\r\nlay. \"The tragedy was terrible,\" said one of the men who helped them\r\nrebuild. \"But the folks here know that it also provided an incredible\r\nopportunity.\"\r\n\r\nI think about Ty'Sheoma Bethea, the young girl from that school I\r\nvisited in Dillon, South Carolina, a place where the ceilings leak, the\r\npaint peels off the walls, and they have to stop teaching six times a\r\nday because the train barrels by their classroom. She had been told\r\nthat her school is hopeless, but the other day after class she went to\r\nthe public library and typed up a letter to the people sitting in this\r\nChamber. She even asked her principal for the money to buy a stamp. The\r\nletter asks us for help and says: \"We are just students trying to\r\nbecome lawyers, doctors, Congressmen like yourself, and one day\r\nPresident, so we can make a change to not just the State of South\r\nCarolina, but also the world. We are not quitters.\" That's what she\r\nsaid: \"We are not quitters.\"\r\n\r\nThese words and these stories tell us something about the spirit of the\r\npeople who sent us here. They tell us that even in the most trying\r\ntimes, amid the most difficult circumstances, there is a generosity, a\r\nresilience, a decency, and a determination that perseveres, a\r\nwillingness to take responsibility for our future and for posterity.\r\nTheir resolve must be our inspiration. Their concerns must be our cause.\r\nAnd we must show them and all our people that we are equal to the task\r\nbefore us.\r\n\r\nI know--look, I know that we haven't agreed on every issue thus far.\r\n[Laughter] There are surely times in the future where we will part ways.\r\nBut I also know that every American who is sitting here tonight loves\r\nthis country and wants it to succeed. I know that. That must be the\r\nstarting point for every debate we have in the coming months and where\r\nwe return after those debates are done. That is the foundation on which\r\nthe American people expect us to build common ground.\r\n\r\nAnd if we do, if we come together and lift this Nation from the depths\r\nof this crisis, if we put our people back to work and restart the\r\nengine of our prosperity, if we confront without fear the challenges of\r\nour time and summon that enduring spirit of an America that does not\r\nquit, then someday years from now our children can tell their children\r\nthat this was the time when we performed, in the words that are carved\r\ninto this very Chamber, \"something worthy to be remembered.\"\r\n\r\nThank you. God bless you, and may God bless the United States of\r\nAmerica. Thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\nAddress Before a Joint Session of the Congress on the State of the Union\r\nBarack Obama\r\nJanuary 27, 2010\r\n\r\n\r\nMadam Speaker, Vice President Biden, Members of Congress, distinguished\r\nguests, and fellow Americans: Our Constitution declares that from time\r\nto time, the President shall give to Congress information about the\r\nstate of our Union. For 220 years, our leaders have fulfilled this duty.\r\nThey've done so during periods of prosperity and tranquility, and\r\nthey've done so in the midst of war and depression, at moments of great\r\nstrife and great struggle.\r\n\r\nIt's tempting to look back on these moments and assume that our\r\nprogress was inevitable, that America was always destined to succeed.\r\nBut when the Union was turned back at Bull Run and the Allies first\r\nlanded at Omaha Beach, victory was very much in doubt. When the market\r\ncrashed on Black Tuesday and marchers were beaten on Bloody Sunday, the\r\nfuture was anything but certain. These were the times that tested the\r\ncourage of our convictions and the strength of our Union. And despite\r\nall our divisions and disagreements, our hesitations and our fears,\r\nAmerica prevailed because we chose to move forward as one Nation, as\r\none people. Again, we are tested. And again, we must answer history's\r\ncall.\r\n\r\nOne year ago, I took office amid two wars, an economy rocked by a\r\nsevere recession, a financial system on the verge of collapse, and a\r\nGovernment deeply in debt. Experts from across the political spectrum\r\nwarned that if we did not act, we might face a second depression. So we\r\nacted, immediately and aggressively. And 1 year later, the worst of the\r\nstorm has passed.\r\n\r\nBut the devastation remains. One in 10 Americans still cannot find work.\r\nMany businesses have shuttered. Home values have declined. Small towns\r\nand rural communities have been hit especially hard. And for those\r\nwho'd already known poverty, life's become that much harder.\r\n\r\nThis recession has also compounded the burdens that America's families\r\nhave been dealing with for decades: the burden of working harder and\r\nlonger for less, of being unable to save enough to retire or help kids\r\nwith college.\r\n\r\nSo I know the anxieties that are out there right now. They're not new.\r\nThese struggles are the reason I ran for President. These struggles are\r\nwhat I've witnessed for years, in places like Elkhart, Indiana;\r\nGalesburg, Illinois. I hear about them in the letters that I read each\r\nnight. The toughest to read are those written by children asking why\r\nthey have to move from their home, asking when their mom or dad will be\r\nable to go back to work.\r\n\r\nFor these Americans and so many others, change has not come fast enough.\r\nSome are frustrated, some are angry. They don't understand why it seems\r\nlike bad behavior on Wall Street is rewarded, but hard work on Main\r\nStreet isn't, or why Washington has been unable or unwilling to solve\r\nany of our problems. They're tired of the partisanship and the shouting\r\nand the pettiness. They know we can't afford it. Not now.\r\n\r\nSo we face big and difficult challenges. And what the American people\r\nhope, what they deserve, is for all of us, Democrats and Republicans,\r\nto work through our differences, to overcome the numbing weight of our\r\npolitics. For while the people who sent us here have different\r\nbackgrounds, different stories, different beliefs, the anxieties they\r\nface are the same. The aspirations they hold are shared: a job that\r\npays the bills, a chance to get ahead, most of all, the ability to give\r\ntheir children a better life.\r\n\r\nAnd you know what else they share? They share a stubborn resilience in\r\nthe face of adversity. After one of the most difficult years in our\r\nhistory, they remain busy building cars and teaching kids, starting\r\nbusinesses and going back to school. They're coaching Little League and\r\nhelping their neighbors. One woman wrote to me and said, \"We are\r\nstrained but hopeful, struggling but encouraged.\"\r\n\r\nIt's because of this spirit, this great decency and great strength,\r\nthat I have never been more hopeful about America's future than I am\r\ntonight. Despite our hardships, our Union is strong. We do not give up.\r\nWe do not quit. We do not allow fear or division to break our spirit.\r\nIn this new decade, it's time the American people get a Government that\r\nmatches their decency, that embodies their strength. And tonight I'd\r\nlike to talk about how together we can deliver on that promise.\r\n\r\nIt begins with our economy. Our most urgent task upon taking office was\r\nto shore up the same banks that helped cause this crisis. It was not\r\neasy to do. And if there's one thing that has unified Democrats and\r\nRepublicans and everybody in between, it's that we all hated the bank\r\nbailout. I hated it. I hated it; you hated it. It was about as popular\r\nas a root canal. [Laughter]\r\n\r\nBut when I ran for President, I promised I wouldn't just do what was\r\npopular; I would do what was necessary. And if we had allowed the\r\nmeltdown of the financial system, unemployment might be double what it\r\nis today. More businesses would certainly have closed. More homes would\r\nhave surely been lost.\r\n\r\nSo I supported the last administration's efforts to create the\r\nfinancial rescue program. And when we took that program over, we made\r\nit more transparent and more accountable. And as a result, the markets\r\nare now stabilized, and we've recovered most of the money we spent on\r\nthe banks--most but not all.\r\n\r\nTo recover the rest, I've proposed a fee on the biggest banks. Now, I\r\nknow Wall Street isn't keen on this idea. But if these firms can afford\r\nto hand out big bonuses again, they can afford a modest fee to pay back\r\nthe taxpayers who rescued them in their time of need.\r\n\r\nNow, as we stabilized the financial system, we also took steps to get\r\nour economy growing again, save as many jobs as possible, and help\r\nAmericans who had become unemployed. That's why we extended or\r\nincreased unemployment benefits for more than 18 million Americans,\r\nmade health insurance 65 percent cheaper for families who get their\r\ncoverage through COBRA, and passed 25 different tax cuts.\r\n\r\nNow, let me repeat: We cut taxes. We cut taxes for 95 percent of\r\nworking families. We cut taxes for small businesses. We cut taxes for\r\nfirst-time home buyers. We cut taxes for parents trying to care for\r\ntheir children. We cut taxes for 8 million Americans paying for college.\r\n[Applause] I thought I'd get some applause on that one. [Laughter]\r\n\r\nAs a result, millions of Americans had more to spend on gas and food\r\nand other necessities, all of which helped businesses keep more workers.\r\nAnd we haven't raised income taxes by a single dime on a single person-\r\n-not a single dime.\r\n\r\nNow, because of the steps we took, there are about 2 million Americans\r\nworking right now who would otherwise be unemployed. Two hundred\r\nthousand work in construction and clean energy. Three hundred thousand\r\nare teachers and other education workers. Tens of thousands are cops,\r\nfirefighters, correctional officers, first-responders. And we're on\r\ntrack to add another 1 1/2 million jobs to this total by the end of the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThe plan that has made all of this possible, from the tax cuts to the\r\njobs, is the Recovery Act. That's right, the Recovery Act, also known\r\nas the stimulus bill. Economists on the left and the right say this\r\nbill has helped save jobs and avert disaster. But you don't have to\r\ntake their word for it. Talk to the small business in Phoenix that will\r\ntriple its workforce because of the Recovery Act. Talk to the window\r\nmanufacturer in Philadelphia who said he used to be skeptical about the\r\nRecovery Act, until he had to add two more work shifts just because of\r\nthe business it created. Talk to the single teacher raising two kids\r\nwho was told by her principal in the last week of school that because\r\nof the Recovery Act, she wouldn't be laid off after all.\r\n\r\nThere are stories like this all across America. And after 2 years of\r\nrecession, the economy is growing again. Retirement funds have started\r\nto gain back some of their value. Businesses are beginning to invest\r\nagain, and slowly some are starting to hire again.\r\n\r\nBut I realize that for every success story, there are other stories, of\r\nmen and women who wake up with the anguish of not knowing where their\r\nnext paycheck will come from, who send out resumes week after week and\r\nhear nothing in response. That is why jobs must be our number-one focus\r\nin 2010, and that's why I'm calling for a new jobs bill tonight.\r\n\r\nNow, the true engine of job creation in this country will always be\r\nAmerica's businesses. [Applause] I agree, absolutely. But Government\r\ncan create the conditions necessary for businesses to expand and hire\r\nmore workers. We should start where most new jobs do, in small\r\nbusinesses, companies that begin when an entrepreneur takes a chance on\r\na dream or a worker decides it's time she became her own boss. Through\r\nsheer grit and determination, these companies have weathered the\r\nrecession, and they're ready to grow. But when you talk to small-\r\nbusiness owners in places like Allentown, Pennsylvania, or Elyria, Ohio,\r\nyou find out that even though banks on Wall Street are lending again,\r\nthey're mostly lending to bigger companies. Financing remains difficult\r\nfor small-business owners across the country, even those that are\r\nmaking a profit.\r\n\r\nSo tonight I'm proposing that we take $30 billion of the money Wall\r\nStreet banks have repaid and use it to help community banks give small\r\nbusinesses the credit they need to stay afloat. I'm also proposing a\r\nnew small business tax credit, one that will go to over 1 million small\r\nbusinesses who hire new workers or raise wages. While we're at it,\r\nlet's also eliminate all capital gains taxes on small-business\r\ninvestment and provide a tax incentive for all large businesses and all\r\nsmall businesses to invest in new plants and equipment.\r\n\r\nNext, we can put Americans to work today building the infrastructure of\r\ntomorrow. From the first railroads to the Interstate Highway System,\r\nour Nation has always been built to compete. There's no reason Europe\r\nor China should have the fastest trains or the new factories that\r\nmanufacture clean energy products. Tomorrow I'll visit Tampa, Florida,\r\nwhere workers will soon break ground on a new high-speed railroad\r\nfunded by the Recovery Act. There are projects like that all across\r\nthis country that will create jobs and help move our Nation's goods,\r\nservices, and information.\r\n\r\nWe should put more Americans to work building clean energy facilities\r\nand give rebates to Americans who make their homes more energy\r\nefficient, which supports clean energy jobs. And to encourage these and\r\nother businesses to stay within our borders, it is time to finally\r\nslash the tax breaks for companies that ship our jobs overseas and give\r\nthose tax breaks to companies that create jobs right here in the United\r\nStates of America.\r\n\r\nNow, the House has passed a jobs bill that includes some of these steps.\r\nAs the first order of business this year, I urge the Senate to do the\r\nsame, and I know they will. They will. People are out of work. They're\r\nhurting. They need our help. And I want a jobs bill on my desk without\r\ndelay.\r\n\r\nBut the truth is, these steps won't make up for the 7 million jobs that\r\nwe've lost over the last 2 years. The only way to move to full\r\nemployment is to lay a new foundation for long-term economic growth and\r\nfinally address the problems that America's families have confronted\r\nfor years.\r\n\r\nWe can't afford another so-called economic expansion like the one from\r\nthe last decade, what some call the \"lost decade,\" where jobs grew more\r\nslowly than during any prior expansion, where the income of the average\r\nAmerican household declined while the cost of health care and tuition\r\nreached record highs, where prosperity was built on a housing bubble\r\nand financial speculation.\r\n\r\nFrom the day I took office, I've been told that addressing our larger\r\nchallenges is too ambitious; such an effort would be too contentious.\r\nI've been told that our political system is too gridlocked and that we\r\nshould just put things on hold for a while. For those who make these\r\nclaims, I have one simple question: How long should we wait? How long\r\nshould America put its future on hold?\r\n\r\nYou see, Washington has been telling us to wait for decades, even as\r\nthe problems have grown worse. Meanwhile, China's not waiting to revamp\r\nits economy. Germany's not waiting. India's not waiting. These nations\r\nare--they're not standing still. These nations aren't playing for\r\nsecond place. They're putting more emphasis on math and science.\r\nThey're rebuilding their infrastructure. They're making serious\r\ninvestments in clean energy because they want those jobs. Well, I do\r\nnot accept second place for the United States of America. As hard as it\r\nmay be, as uncomfortable and contentious as the debates may become,\r\nit's time to get serious about fixing the problems that are hampering\r\nour growth.\r\n\r\nNow, one place to start is serious financial reform. Look, I am not\r\ninterested in punishing banks. I'm interested in protecting our economy.\r\nA strong, healthy financial market makes it possible for businesses to\r\naccess credit and create new jobs. It channels the savings of families\r\ninto investments that raise incomes. But that can only happen if we\r\nguard against the same recklessness that nearly brought down our entire\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\nWe need to make sure consumers and middle class families have the\r\ninformation they need to make financial decisions. We can't allow\r\nfinancial institutions, including those that take your deposits, to\r\ntake risks that threaten the whole economy.\r\n\r\nNow, the House has already passed financial reform with many of these\r\nchanges, and the lobbyists are trying to kill it. But we cannot let\r\nthem win this fight. And if the bill that ends up on my desk does not\r\nmeet the test of real reform, I will send it back until we get it right.\r\nWe've got to get it right.\r\n\r\nNext, we need to encourage American innovation. Last year, we made the\r\nlargest investment in basic research funding in history, an investment\r\nthat could lead to the world's cheapest solar cells or treatment that\r\nkills cancer cells, but leaves healthy ones untouched. And no area is\r\nmore ripe for such innovation than energy. You can see the results of\r\nlast year's investments in clean energy in the North Carolina company\r\nthat will create 1,200 jobs nationwide helping to make advanced\r\nbatteries or in the California business that will put a thousand people\r\nto work making solar panels.\r\n\r\nBut to create more of these clean energy jobs, we need more production,\r\nmore efficiency, more incentives. And that means building a new\r\ngeneration of safe, clean nuclear power plants in this country. It\r\nmeans making tough decisions about opening new offshore areas for oil\r\nand gas development. It means continued investment in advanced biofuels\r\nand clean coal technologies. And yes, it means passing a comprehensive\r\nenergy and climate bill with incentives that will finally make clean\r\nenergy the profitable kind of energy in America. Now, I am grateful to\r\nthe House for passing such a bill last year. And this year, I'm eager\r\nto help advance the bipartisan effort in the Senate.\r\n\r\nI know there have been questions about whether we can afford such\r\nchanges in a tough economy. I know that there are those who disagree\r\nwith the overwhelming scientific evidence on climate change. But here's\r\nthe thing: Even if you doubt the evidence, providing incentives for\r\nenergy efficiency and clean energy are the right thing to do for our\r\nfuture, because the nation that leads the clean energy economy will be\r\nthe nation that leads the global economy. And America must be that\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nThird, we need to export more of our goods, because the more products\r\nwe make and sell to other countries, the more jobs we support right\r\nhere in America. So tonight we set a new goal: We will double our\r\nexports over the next 5 years, an increase that will support 2 million\r\njobs in America. To help meet this goal, we're launching a National\r\nExport Initiative that will help farmers and small businesses increase\r\ntheir exports and reform export controls consistent with national\r\nsecurity.\r\n\r\nWe have to seek new markets aggressively, just as our competitors are.\r\nIf America sits on the sidelines while other nations sign trade deals,\r\nwe will lose the chance to create jobs on our shores. But realizing\r\nthose benefits also means enforcing those agreements so our trading\r\npartners play by the rules. And that's why we'll continue to shape a\r\nDoha trade agreement that opens global markets and why we will\r\nstrengthen our trade relations in Asia and with key partners like South\r\nKorea and Panama and Colombia.\r\n\r\nFourth, we need to invest in the skills and education of our people.\r\nNow, this year, we've broken through the stalemate between left and\r\nright by launching a national competition to improve our schools. And\r\nthe idea here is simple: Instead of rewarding failure, we only reward\r\nsuccess. Instead of funding the status quo, we only invest in reform,\r\nreform that raises student achievement, inspires students to excel in\r\nmath and science, and turns around failing schools that steal the\r\nfuture of too many young Americans, from rural communities to the inner\r\ncity. In the 21st century, the best antipoverty program around is a\r\nworld-class education. And in this country, the success of our children\r\ncannot depend more on where they live than on their potential. When we\r\nrenew the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, we will work with\r\nCongress to expand these reforms to all 50 States.\r\n\r\nStill, in this economy, a high school diploma no longer guarantees a\r\ngood job. That's why I urge the Senate to follow the House and pass a\r\nbill that will revitalize our community colleges, which are a career\r\npathway to the children of so many working families.\r\n\r\nTo make college more affordable, this bill will finally end the\r\nunwarranted taxpayer subsidies that go to banks for student loans.\r\nInstead, let's take that money and give families a $10,000 tax credit\r\nfor 4 years of college and increase Pell grants. And let's tell another\r\n1 million students that when they graduate, they will be required to\r\npay only 10 percent of their income on student loans and all of their\r\ndebt will be forgiven after 20 years and forgiven after 10 years if\r\nthey choose a career in public service, because in the United States of\r\nAmerica, no one should go broke because they chose to go to college.\r\nAnd by the way, it's time for colleges and universities to get serious\r\nabout cutting their own costs, because they too have a responsibility\r\nto help solve this problem.\r\n\r\nNow, the price of college tuition is just one of the burdens facing the\r\nmiddle class. That's why last year, I asked Vice President Biden to\r\nchair a task force on middle class families. That's why we're nearly\r\ndoubling the childcare tax credit and making it easier to save for\r\nretirement by giving access to every worker a retirement account and\r\nexpanding the tax credit for those who start a nest egg. That's why\r\nwe're working to lift the value of a family's single largest investment,\r\ntheir home. The steps we took last year to shore up the housing market\r\nhave allowed millions of Americans to take out new loans and save an\r\naverage of $1,500 on mortgage payments. This year, we will step up\r\nrefinancing so that homeowners can move into more affordable mortgages.\r\n\r\nAnd it is precisely to relieve the burden on middle class families that\r\nwe still need health insurance reform. Yes, we do.\r\n\r\nNow, let's clear a few things up. I didn't choose to tackle this issue\r\nto get some legislative victory under my belt. And by now it should be\r\nfairly obvious that I didn't take on health care because it was good\r\npolitics. [Laughter] I took on health care because of the stories I've\r\nheard from Americans with preexisting conditions whose lives depend on\r\ngetting coverage, patients who've been denied coverage, families, even\r\nthose with insurance, who are just one illness away from financial ruin.\r\n\r\nAfter nearly a century of trying--Democratic administrations,\r\nRepublican administrations--we are closer than ever to bringing more\r\nsecurity to the lives of so many Americans. The approach we've taken\r\nwould protect every American from the worst practices of the insurance\r\nindustry. It would give small businesses and uninsured Americans a\r\nchance to choose an affordable health care plan in a competitive market.\r\nIt would require every insurance plan to cover preventive care.\r\n\r\nAnd by the way, I want to acknowledge our First Lady, Michelle Obama,\r\nwho this year is creating a national movement to tackle the epidemic of\r\nchildhood obesity and make kids healthier. [Applause] Thank you, honey.\r\nShe gets embarrassed. [Laughter]\r\n\r\nOur approach would preserve the right of Americans who have insurance\r\nto keep their doctor and their plan. It would reduce costs and premiums\r\nfor millions of families and businesses. And according to the\r\nCongressional Budget Office, the independent organization that both\r\nparties have cited as the official scorekeeper for Congress, our\r\napproach would bring down the deficit by as much as $1 trillion over\r\nthe next two decades.\r\n\r\nStill, this is a complex issue, and the longer it was debated, the more\r\nskeptical people became. I take my share of the blame for not\r\nexplaining it more clearly to the American people. And I know that with\r\nall the lobbying and horse-trading, the process left most Americans\r\nwondering, \"What's in it for me?\"\r\n\r\nBut I also know this problem is not going away. By the time I'm\r\nfinished speaking tonight, more Americans will have lost their health\r\ninsurance. Millions will lose it this year. Our deficit will grow.\r\nPremiums will go up. Patients will be denied the care they need. Small-\r\nbusiness owners will continue to drop coverage altogether. I will not\r\nwalk away from these Americans, and neither should the people in this\r\nChamber.\r\n\r\nSo as temperatures cool, I want everyone to take another look at the\r\nplan we've proposed. There's a reason why many doctors, nurses, and\r\nhealth care experts who know our system best consider this approach a\r\nvast improvement over the status quo. But if anyone from either party\r\nhas a better approach that will bring down premiums, bring down the\r\ndeficit, cover the uninsured, strengthen Medicare for seniors, and stop\r\ninsurance company abuses, let me know. Let me know. Let me know. I'm\r\neager to see it.\r\n\r\nHere's what I ask Congress, though: Don't walk away from reform. Not\r\nnow. Not when we are so close. Let us find a way to come together and\r\nfinish the job for the American people. Let's get it done. Let's get it\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nNow, even as health care reform would reduce our deficit, it's not\r\nenough to dig us out of a massive fiscal hole in which we find\r\nourselves. It's a challenge that makes all others that much harder to\r\nsolve and one that's been subject to a lot of political posturing. So\r\nlet me start the discussion of Government spending by setting the\r\nrecord straight.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the last decade, the year 2000, America had a\r\nbudget surplus of over $200 billion. By the time I took office, we had\r\na 1-year deficit of over $1 trillion and projected deficits of $8\r\ntrillion over the next decade. Most of this was the result of not\r\npaying for two wars, two tax cuts, and an expensive prescription drug\r\nprogram. On top of that, the effects of the recession put a $3 trillion\r\nhole in our budget. All this was before I walked in the door. [Laughter]\r\n\r\nNow--[applause]--just stating the facts. Now, if we had taken office in\r\nordinary times, I would have liked nothing more than to start bringing\r\ndown the deficit. But we took office amid a crisis. And our efforts to\r\nprevent a second depression have added another $1 trillion to our\r\nnational debt. That too is a fact.\r\n\r\nI'm absolutely convinced that was the right thing to do. But families\r\nacross the country are tightening their belts and making tough\r\ndecisions. The Federal Government should do the same. So tonight I'm\r\nproposing specific steps to pay for the trillion dollars that it took\r\nto rescue the economy last year.\r\n\r\nStarting in 2011, we are prepared to freeze Government spending for 3\r\nyears. Spending related to our national security, Medicare, Medicaid,\r\nand Social Security will not be affected. But all other discretionary\r\nGovernment programs will. Like any cash-strapped family, we will work\r\nwithin a budget to invest in what we need and sacrifice what we don't.\r\nAnd if I have to enforce this discipline by veto, I will.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to go through the budget, line by line, page by page,\r\nto eliminate programs that we can't afford and don't work. We've\r\nalready identified $20 billion in savings for next year. To help\r\nworking families, we'll extend our middle class tax cuts. But at a time\r\nof record deficits, we will not continue tax cuts for oil companies,\r\nfor investment fund managers, and for those making over $250,000 a year.\r\nWe just can't afford it.\r\n\r\nNow, even after paying for what we spent on my watch, we'll still face\r\nthe massive deficit we had when I took office. More importantly, the\r\ncost of Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security will continue to\r\nskyrocket. That's why I've called for a bipartisan fiscal commission,\r\nmodeled on a proposal by Republican Judd Gregg and Democrat Kent Conrad.\r\nThis can't be one of those Washington gimmicks that lets us pretend we\r\nsolve a problem. The commission will have to provide a specific set of\r\nsolutions by a certain deadline.\r\n\r\nNow, yesterday the Senate blocked a bill that would have created this\r\ncommission, so I'll issue an Executive order that will allow us to go\r\nforward, because I refuse to pass this problem on to another generation\r\nof Americans. And when the vote comes tomorrow, the Senate should\r\nrestore the pay-as-you-go law that was a big reason for why we had\r\nrecord surpluses in the 1990s.\r\n\r\nNow, I know that some in my own party will argue that we can't address\r\nthe deficit or freeze Government spending when so many are still\r\nhurting. And I agree, which is why this freeze won't take effect until\r\nnext year, when the economy is stronger. That's how budgeting works.\r\n[Laughter] But understand, if we don't take meaningful steps to rein in\r\nour debt, it could damage our markets, increase the cost of borrowing,\r\nand jeopardize our recovery, all of which would have an even worse\r\neffect on our job growth and family incomes.\r\n\r\nFrom some on the right, I expect we'll hear a different argument, that\r\nif we just make fewer investments in our people, extend tax cuts,\r\nincluding those for the wealthier Americans, eliminate more regulations,\r\nmaintain the status quo on health care, our deficits will go away. The\r\nproblem is, that's what we did for 8 years. That's what helped us into\r\nthis crisis. It's what helped lead to these deficits. We can't do it\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nRather than fight the same tired battles that have dominated Washington\r\nfor decades, it's time to try something new. Let's invest in our people\r\nwithout leaving them a mountain of debt. Let's meet our responsibility\r\nto the citizens who sent us here. Let's try common sense--[Laughter]--a\r\nnovel concept.\r\n\r\nNow, to do that, we have to recognize that we face more than a deficit\r\nof dollars right now. We face a deficit of trust, deep and corrosive\r\ndoubts about how Washington works that have been growing for years. To\r\nclose that credibility gap, we have to take action on both ends of\r\nPennsylvania Avenue to end the outsized influence of lobbyists, to do\r\nour work openly, to give our people the Government they deserve.\r\n\r\nNow, that's what I came to Washington to do. That's why, for the first\r\ntime in history, my administration posts on--our White House visitors\r\nonline. That's why we've excluded lobbyists from policymaking jobs or\r\nseats on Federal boards and commissions. But we can't stop there. It's\r\ntime to require lobbyists to disclose each contact they make on behalf\r\nof a client, with my administration or with Congress. It's time to put\r\nstrict limits on the contributions that lobbyists give to candidates\r\nfor Federal office.\r\n\r\nWith all due deference to separation of powers, last week, the Supreme\r\nCourt reversed a century of law that I believe will open the floodgates\r\nfor special interests, including foreign corporations, to spend without\r\nlimit in our elections. I don't think American elections should be\r\nbankrolled by America's most powerful interests, or worse, by foreign\r\nentities. They should be decided by the American people. And I'd urge\r\nDemocrats and Republicans to pass a bill that helps correct some of\r\nthese problems.\r\n\r\nI'm also calling on Congress to continue down the path of earmark\r\nreform, Democrats and Republicans--Democrats and Republicans. Look,\r\nyou've trimmed some of this spending, you've embraced some meaningful\r\nchange, but restoring the public trust demands more. For example, some\r\nMembers of Congress post some earmark requests online. Tonight I'm\r\ncalling on Congress to publish all earmark requests on a single web\r\nsite before there's a vote so that the American people can see how\r\ntheir money is being spent.\r\n\r\nOf course, none of these reforms will even happen if we don't also\r\nreform how we work with one another. Now, I'm not naive. I never\r\nthought that the mere fact of my election would usher in peace and\r\nharmony and--[Laughter]--some postpartisan era. I knew that both\r\nparties have fed divisions that are deeply entrenched. And on some\r\nissues, there are simply philosophical differences that will always\r\ncause us to part ways. These disagreements, about the role of\r\ngovernment in our lives, about our national priorities and our national\r\nsecurity, they've been taking place for over 200 years. They're the\r\nvery essence of our democracy.\r\n\r\nBut what frustrates the American people is a Washington where every day\r\nis election day. We can't wage a perpetual campaign where the only goal\r\nis to see who can get the most embarrassing headlines about the other\r\nside, a belief that if you lose, I win. Neither party should delay or\r\nobstruct every single bill just because they can. The confirmation of--\r\nI'm speaking to both parties now--the confirmation of well-qualified\r\npublic servants shouldn't be held hostage to the pet projects or\r\ngrudges of a few individual Senators.\r\n\r\nWashington may think that saying anything about the other side, no\r\nmatter how false, no matter how malicious, is just part of the game.\r\nBut it's precisely such politics that has stopped either party from\r\nhelping the American people. Worse yet, it's sowing further division\r\namong our citizens, further distrust in our Government. So no, I will\r\nnot give up on trying to change the tone of our politics. I know it's\r\nan election year. And after last week, it's clear that campaign fever\r\nhas come even earlier than usual. But we still need to govern.\r\n\r\nTo Democrats, I would remind you that we still have the largest\r\nmajority in decades and the people expect us to solve problems, not run\r\nfor the hills. And if the Republican leadership is going to insist that\r\n60 votes in the Senate are required to do any business at all in this\r\ntown--a supermajority--then the responsibility to govern is now yours\r\nas well. Just saying no to everything may be good short-term politics,\r\nbut it's not leadership. We were sent here to serve our citizens, not\r\nour ambitions. So let's show the American people that we can do it\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nThis week, I'll be addressing a meeting of the House Republicans. I'd\r\nlike to begin monthly meetings with both Democratic and Republican\r\nleadership. I know you can't wait. [Laughter]\r\n\r\nNow, throughout our history, no issue has united this country more than\r\nour security. Sadly, some of the unity we felt after 9/11 has\r\ndissipated. And we can argue all we want about who's to blame for this,\r\nbut I'm not interested in relitigating the past. I know that all of us\r\nlove this country. All of us are committed to its defense. So let's put\r\naside the schoolyard taunts about who's tough. Let's reject the false\r\nchoice between protecting our people and upholding our values. Let's\r\nleave behind the fear and division and do what it takes to defend our\r\nNation and forge a more hopeful future for America and for the world.\r\n\r\nThat's the work we began last year. Since the day I took office, we've\r\nrenewed our focus on the terrorists who threaten our Nation. We've made\r\nsubstantial investments in our homeland security and disrupted plots\r\nthat threatened to take American lives. We are filling unacceptable\r\ngaps revealed by the failed Christmas attack, with better airline\r\nsecurity and swifter action on our intelligence. We've prohibited\r\ntorture and strengthened partnerships from the Pacific to South Asia to\r\nthe Arabian Peninsula. And in the last year, hundreds of Al Qaida's\r\nfighters and affiliates, including many senior leaders, have been\r\ncaptured or killed, far more than in 2008.\r\n\r\nAnd in Afghanistan, we're increasing our troops and training Afghan\r\nsecurity forces so they can begin to take the lead in July of 2011 and\r\nour troops can begin to come home. We will reward good governance, work\r\nto reduce corruption, and support the rights of all Afghans, men and\r\nwomen alike. We're joined by allies and partners who have increased\r\ntheir own commitments and who will come together tomorrow in London to\r\nreaffirm our common purpose. There will be difficult days ahead, but I\r\nam absolutely confident we will succeed.\r\n\r\nAs we take the fight to Al Qaida, we are responsibly leaving Iraq to\r\nits people. As a candidate, I promised that I would end this war, and\r\nthat is what I am doing as President. We will have all of our combat\r\ntroops out of Iraq by the end of this August. We will support the Iraqi\r\nGovernment as they hold elections, and we will continue to partner with\r\nthe Iraqi people to promote regional peace and prosperity. But make no\r\nmistake: This war is ending, and all of our troops are coming home.\r\n\r\nTonight all of our men and women in uniform, in Iraq, in Afghanistan,\r\nand around the world, they have to know that we--that they have our\r\nrespect, our gratitude, our full support. And just as they must have\r\nthe resources they need in war, we all have a responsibility to support\r\nthem when they come home. That's why we made the largest increase in\r\ninvestments for veterans in decades last year. That's why we're\r\nbuilding a 21st-century VA. And that's why Michelle has joined with\r\nJill Biden to forge a national commitment to support military families.\r\n\r\nNow, even as we prosecute two wars, we're also confronting perhaps the\r\ngreatest danger to the American people, the threat of nuclear weapons.\r\nI've embraced the vision of John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan through a\r\nstrategy that reverses the spread of these weapons and seeks a world\r\nwithout them. To reduce our stockpiles and launchers, while ensuring\r\nour deterrent, the United States and Russia are completing negotiations\r\non the farthest reaching arms control treaty in nearly two decades. And\r\nat April's Nuclear Security Summit, we will bring 44 nations together\r\nhere in Washington, DC, behind a clear goal: securing all vulnerable\r\nnuclear materials around the world in 4 years so that they never fall\r\ninto the hands of terrorists.\r\n\r\nNow, these diplomatic efforts have also strengthened our hand in\r\ndealing with those nations that insist on violating international\r\nagreements in pursuit of nuclear weapons. That's why North Korea now\r\nfaces increased isolation and stronger sanctions, sanctions that are\r\nbeing vigorously enforced. That's why the international community is\r\nmore united and the Islamic Republic of Iran is more isolated. And as\r\nIran's leaders continue to ignore their obligations, there should be no\r\ndoubt: They too will face growing consequences. That is a promise.\r\n\r\nThat's the leadership we are providing: engagement that advances the\r\ncommon security and prosperity of all people. We're working through the\r\nG-20 to sustain a lasting global recovery. We're working with Muslim\r\ncommunities around the world to promote science and education and\r\ninnovation. We have gone from a bystander to a leader in the fight\r\nagainst climate change. We're helping developing countries to feed\r\nthemselves and continuing the fight against HIV/AIDS. And we are\r\nlaunching a new initiative that will give us the capacity to respond\r\nfaster and more effectively to bioterrorism or an infectious disease, a\r\nplan that will counter threats at home and strengthen public health\r\nabroad.\r\n\r\nAs we have for over 60 years, America takes these actions because our\r\ndestiny is connected to those beyond our shores. But we also do it\r\nbecause it is right. That's why, as we meet here tonight, over 10,000\r\nAmericans are working with many nations to help the people of Haiti\r\nrecover and rebuild. That's why we stand with the girl who yearns to go\r\nto school in Afghanistan, why we support the human rights of the women\r\nmarching through the streets of Iran, why we advocate for the young man\r\ndenied a job by corruption in Guinea. For America must always stand on\r\nthe side of freedom and human dignity--always.\r\n\r\nAbroad, America's greatest source of strength has always been our\r\nideals. The same is true at home. We find unity in our incredible\r\ndiversity, drawing on the promise enshrined in our Constitution: The\r\nnotion that we're all created equal; that no matter who you are or what\r\nyou look like, if you abide by the law, you should be protected by it;\r\nif you adhere to our common values, you should be treated no different\r\nthan anyone else.\r\n\r\nWe must continually renew this promise. My administration has a\r\nDivision that is once again prosecuting violations and employment\r\ndiscrimination. We finally strengthened our laws to protect against\r\ncrimes driven by hate. This year, I will work with Congress and our\r\nmilitary to finally repeal the law that denies gay Americans the right\r\nto serve the country they love because of who they are. It's the right\r\nthing to do.\r\n\r\nWe're going to crack down on violations of equal pay laws so that women\r\nget equal pay for an equal day's work. And we should continue the work\r\nof fixing our broken immigration system, to secure our borders and\r\nenforce our laws and ensure that everyone who plays by the rules can\r\ncontribute to our economy and enrich our Nation.\r\n\r\nIn the end, it's our ideals, our values that built America, values that\r\nallowed us to forge a nation made up of immigrants from every corner of\r\nthe globe, values that drive our citizens still. Every day, Americans\r\nmeet their responsibilities to their families and their employers. Time\r\nand again, they lend a hand to their neighbors and give back to their\r\ncountry. They take pride in their labor and are generous in spirit.\r\nThese aren't Republican values or Democratic values that they're living\r\nby, business values or labor values, they're American values.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, too many of our citizens have lost faith that our\r\nbiggest institutions--our corporations, our media, and, yes, our\r\nGovernment--still reflect these same values. Each of these institutions\r\nare full of honorable men and women doing important work that helps our\r\ncountry prosper. But each time a CEO rewards himself for failure or a\r\nbanker puts the rest of us at risk for his own selfish gain, people's\r\ndoubts grow. Each time lobbyists game the system or politicians tear\r\neach other down instead of lifting this country up, we lose faith. The\r\nmore that TV pundits reduce serious debates to silly arguments, big\r\nissues into sound bites, our citizens turn away. No wonder there's so\r\nmuch cynicism out there. No wonder there's so much disappointment.\r\n\r\nI campaigned on the promise of change. Change we can believe in, the\r\nslogan went. And right now I know there are many Americans who aren't\r\nsure if they still believe we can change or that I can deliver it.\r\n\r\nBut remember this: I never suggested that change would be easy or that\r\nI could do it alone. Democracy in a nation of 300 million people can be\r\nnoisy and messy and complicated. And when you try to do big things and\r\nmake big changes, it stirs passions and controversy. That's just how it\r\nis.\r\n\r\nThose of us in public office can respond to this reality by playing it\r\nsafe and avoid telling hard truths and pointing fingers. We can do\r\nwhat's necessary to keep our poll numbers high and get through the next\r\nelection, instead of doing what's best for the next generation.\r\n\r\nBut I also know this: If people had made that decision 50 years ago or\r\n100 years ago or 200 years ago, we wouldn't be here tonight. The only\r\nreason we are here is because generations of Americans were unafraid to\r\ndo what was hard, to do what was needed even when success was uncertain,\r\nto do what it took to keep the dream of this Nation alive for their\r\nchildren and their grandchildren.\r\n\r\nNow, our administration has had some political setbacks this year, and\r\nsome of them were deserved. But I wake up every day knowing that they\r\nare nothing compared to the setbacks that families all across this\r\ncountry have faced this year. And what keeps me going, what keeps me\r\nfighting, is that despite all these setbacks, that spirit of\r\ndetermination and optimism, that fundamental decency that has always\r\nbeen at the core of the American people, that lives on.\r\n\r\nIt lives on in the struggling small-business owner who wrote to me of\r\nhis company, \"None of us,\" he said, \". . . are willing to consider,\r\neven slightly, that we might fail.\" It lives on in the woman who said\r\nthat even though she and her neighbors have felt the pain of recession,\r\n\"We are strong. We are resilient. We are American.\" It lives on in the\r\n8-year-old boy in Louisiana who just sent me his allowance and asked if\r\nI would give it to the people of Haiti. And it lives on in all the\r\nAmericans who've dropped everything to go someplace they've never been\r\nand pull people they've never known from the rubble, prompting chants\r\nof \"U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\" when another life was saved.\r\n\r\nThe spirit that has sustained this Nation for more than two centuries\r\nlives on in you, its people. We have finished a difficult year. We have\r\ncome through a difficult decade. But a new year has come. A new decade\r\nstretches before us. We don't quit. I don't quit. Let's seize this\r\nmoment to start anew, to carry the dream forward, and to strengthen our\r\nUnion once more.\r\n\r\nThank you. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\nAddress Before a Joint Session of the Congress on the State of the Union\r\nBarack Obama\r\nJanuary 25, 2011\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, distinguished\r\nguests, and fellow Americans: Tonight I want to begin by congratulating\r\nthe men and women of the 112th Congress, as well as your new Speaker,\r\nJohn Boehner. And as we mark this occasion, we're also mindful of the\r\nempty chair in this Chamber, and we pray for the health of our\r\ncolleague and our friend Gabby Giffords.\r\n\r\nIt's no secret that those of us here tonight have had our differences\r\nover the last 2 years. The debates have been contentious; we have\r\nfought fiercely for our beliefs. And that's a good thing. That's what a\r\nrobust democracy demands. That's what helps set us apart as a nation.\r\n\r\nBut there's a reason the tragedy in Tucson gave us pause. Amid all the\r\nnoise and passion and rancor of our public debate, Tucson reminded us\r\nthat no matter who we are or where we come from, each of us is a part\r\nof something greater, something more consequential than party or\r\npolitical preference.\r\n\r\nWe are part of the American family. We believe that in a country where\r\nevery race and faith and point of view can be found, we are still bound\r\ntogether as one people, that we share common hopes and a common creed,\r\nthat the dreams of a little girl in Tucson are not so different than\r\nthose of our own children, that they all deserve the chance to be\r\nfulfilled. That too is what sets us apart as a nation.\r\n\r\nNow, by itself, this simple recognition won't usher in a new era of\r\ncooperation. What comes of this moment is up to us. What comes of this\r\nmoment will be determined not by whether we can sit together tonight,\r\nbut whether we can work together tomorrow.\r\n\r\nI believe we can, and I believe we must. That's what the people who\r\nsent us here expect of us. With their votes, they've determined that\r\ngoverning will now be a shared responsibility between parties. New laws\r\nwill only pass with support from Democrats and Republicans. We will\r\nmove forward together or not at all, for the challenges we face are\r\nbigger than party and bigger than politics.\r\n\r\nAt stake right now is not who wins the next election. After all, we\r\njust had an election. At stake is whether new jobs and industries take\r\nroot in this country or somewhere else. It's whether the hard work and\r\nindustry of our people is rewarded. It's whether we sustain the\r\nleadership that has made America not just a place on a map, but the\r\nlight to the world.\r\n\r\nWe are poised for progress. Two years after the worst recession most of\r\nus have ever known, the stock market has come roaring back, corporate\r\nprofits are up, the economy is growing again.\r\n\r\nBut we have never measured progress by these yardsticks alone. We\r\nmeasure progress by the success of our people, by the jobs they can\r\nfind and the quality of life those jobs offer, by the prospects of a\r\nsmall-business owner who dreams of turning a good idea into a thriving\r\nenterprise, by the opportunities for a better life that we pass on to\r\nour children.\r\n\r\nThat's the project the American people want us to work on--together.\r\n\r\nNow, we did that in December. Thanks to the tax cuts we passed,\r\nAmericans' paychecks are a little bigger today. Every business can\r\nwrite off the full cost of new investments that they make this year.\r\nAnd these steps, taken by Democrats and Republicans, will grow the\r\neconomy and add to the more than 1 million private sector jobs created\r\nlast year.\r\n\r\nBut we have to do more. These steps we've taken over the last 2 years\r\nmay have broken the back of this recession, but to win the future,\r\nwe'll need to take on challenges that have been decades in the making.\r\n\r\nMany people watching tonight can probably remember a time when finding\r\na good job meant showing up at a nearby factory or a business downtown.\r\nYou didn't always need a degree, and your competition was pretty much\r\nlimited to your neighbors. If you worked hard, chances are you'd have a\r\njob for life, with a decent paycheck and good benefits and the\r\noccasional promotion. Maybe you'd even have the pride of seeing your\r\nkids work at the same company.\r\n\r\nThat world has changed. And for many, the change has been painful. I've\r\nseen it in the shuttered windows of once booming factories and the\r\nvacant storefronts on once busy Main Streets. I've heard it in the\r\nfrustrations of Americans who've seen their paychecks dwindle or their\r\njobs disappear, proud men and women who feel like the rules have been\r\nchanged in the middle of the game.\r\n\r\nThey're right. The rules have changed. In a single generation,\r\nrevolutions in technology have transformed the way we live, work, and\r\ndo business. Steel mills that once needed 1,000 workers can now do the\r\nsame work with 100. Today, just about any company can set up shop, hire\r\nworkers, and sell their products wherever there's an Internet\r\nconnection.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, nations like China and India realized that with some changes\r\nof their own, they could compete in this new world. And so they started\r\neducating their children earlier and longer, with greater emphasis on\r\nmath and science. They're investing in research and new technologies.\r\nJust recently, China became the home to the world's largest private\r\nsolar research facility and the world's fastest computer.\r\n\r\nSo yes, the world is changed. The competition for jobs is real. But\r\nthis shouldn't discourage us. It should challenge us. Remember, for all\r\nthe hits we've taken these last few years, for all the naysayers\r\npredicting our decline, America still has the largest, most prosperous\r\neconomy in the world. No workers are more productive than ours. No\r\ncountry has more successful companies or grants more patents to\r\ninventors and entrepreneurs. We're the home to the world's best\r\ncolleges and universities, where more students come to study than any\r\nplace on Earth.\r\n\r\nWhat's more, we are the first nation to be founded for the sake of an\r\nidea: the idea that each of us deserves the chance to shape our own\r\ndestiny. That's why centuries of pioneers and immigrants have risked\r\neverything to come here. It's why our students don't just memorize\r\nequations, but answer questions like: \"What do you think of that idea?\r\nWhat would you change about the world? What do you want to be when you\r\ngrow up?\"\r\n\r\nThe future is ours to win. But to get there, we can't just stand still.\r\nAs Robert Kennedy told us: \"The future is not a gift. It is an\r\nachievement.\" Sustaining the American Dream has never been about\r\nstanding pat. It has required each generation to sacrifice and struggle\r\nand meet the demands of a new age.\r\n\r\nAnd now it's our turn. We know what it takes to compete for the jobs\r\nand industries of our time. We need to outinnovate, outeducate, and\r\noutbuild the rest of the world. We have to make America the best place\r\non Earth to do business. We need to take responsibility for our deficit\r\nand reform our Government. That's how our people will prosper. That's\r\nhow we'll win the future. And tonight I'd like to talk about how we get\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nThe first step in winning the future is encouraging American innovation.\r\nNone of us can predict with certainty what the next big industry will\r\nbe or where the new jobs will come from. Thirty years ago, we couldn't\r\nknow that something called the Internet would lead to an economic\r\nrevolution. What we can do--what America does better than anyone else--\r\nis spark the creativity and imagination of our people. We're the nation\r\nthat put cars in driveways and computers in offices; the nation of\r\nEdison and the Wright brothers, of Google and Facebook. In America,\r\ninnovation doesn't just change our lives. It is how we make our living.\r\n\r\nOur free enterprise system is what drives innovation. But because it's\r\nnot always profitable for companies to invest in basic research,\r\nthroughout our history, our Government has provided cutting-edge\r\nscientists and inventors with the support that they need. That's what\r\nplanted the seeds for the Internet. That's what helped make possible\r\nthings like computer chips and GPS. Just think of all the good jobs--\r\nfrom manufacturing to retail--that have come from these breakthroughs.\r\n\r\nHalf a century ago, when the Soviets beat us into space with the launch\r\nof a satellite called Sputnik, we had no idea how we would beat them to\r\nthe Moon. The science wasn't even there yet. NASA didn't exist. But\r\nafter investing in better research and education, we didn't just\r\nsurpass the Soviets, we unleashed a wave of innovation that created new\r\nindustries and millions of new jobs.\r\n\r\nThis is our generation's Sputnik moment. Two years ago, I said that we\r\nneeded to reach a level of research and development we haven't seen\r\nsince the height of the space race. And in a few weeks, I will be\r\nsending a budget to Congress that helps us meet that goal. We'll invest\r\nin biomedical research, information technology, and especially clean\r\nenergy technology, an investment that will strengthen our security,\r\nprotect our planet, and create countless new jobs for our people.\r\n\r\nAlready, we're seeing the promise of renewable energy. Robert and Gary\r\nAllen are brothers who run a small Michigan roofing company. After\r\nSeptember 11, they volunteered their best roofers to help repair the\r\nPentagon. But half of their factory went unused, and the recession hit\r\nthem hard. Today, with the help of a Government loan, that empty space\r\nis being used to manufacture solar shingles that are being sold all\r\nacross the country. In Robert's words, \"We reinvented ourselves.\"\r\n\r\nThat's what Americans have done for over 200 years: reinvented\r\nourselves. And to spur on more success stories like the Allen Brothers,\r\nwe've begun to reinvent our energy policy. We're not just handing out\r\nmoney. We're issuing a challenge. We're telling America's scientists\r\nand engineers that if they assemble teams of the best minds in their\r\nfields and focus on the hardest problems in clean energy, we'll fund\r\nthe Apollo projects of our time.\r\n\r\nAt the California Institute of Technology, they're developing a way to\r\nturn sunlight and water into fuel for our cars. At Oak Ridge National\r\nLaboratory, they're using supercomputers to get a lot more power out of\r\nour nuclear facilities. With more research and incentives, we can break\r\nour dependence on oil with biofuels and become the first country to\r\nhave a million electric vehicles on the road by 2015.\r\n\r\nWe need to get behind this innovation. And to help pay for it, I'm\r\nasking Congress to eliminate the billions in taxpayer dollars we\r\ncurrently give to oil companies. I don't know if you've noticed, but\r\nthey're doing just fine on their own. [Laughter] So instead of\r\nsubsidizing yesterday's energy, let's invest in tomorrow's.\r\n\r\nNow, clean energy breakthroughs will only translate into clean energy\r\njobs if businesses know there will be a market for what they're selling.\r\nSo tonight I challenge you to join me in setting a new goal: By 2035,\r\n80 percent of America's electricity will come from clean energy sources.\r\n\r\nSome folks want wind and solar. Others want nuclear, clean coal, and\r\nnatural gas. To meet this goal, we will need them all, and I urge\r\nDemocrats and Republicans to work together to make it happen.\r\n\r\nMaintaining our leadership in research and technology is crucial to\r\nAmerica's success. But if we want to win the future, if we want\r\ninnovation to produce jobs in America and not overseas, then we also\r\nhave to win the race to educate our kids.\r\n\r\nThink about it. Over the next 10 years, nearly half of all new jobs\r\nwill require education that goes beyond a high school education. And\r\nyet as many as a quarter of our students aren't even finishing high\r\nschool. The quality of our math and science education lags behind many\r\nother nations. America has fallen to ninth in the proportion of young\r\npeople with a college degree. And so the question is whether all of us,\r\nas citizens and as parents, are willing to do what's necessary to give\r\nevery child a chance to succeed.\r\n\r\nThat responsibility begins not in our classrooms, but in our homes and\r\ncommunities. It's family that first instills the love of learning in a\r\nchild. Only parents can make sure the TV is turned off and homework\r\ngets done. We need to teach our kids that it's not just the winner of\r\nthe Super Bowl who deserves to be celebrated, but the winner of the\r\nscience fair. We need to teach them that success is not a function of\r\nfame or PR, but of hard work and discipline.\r\n\r\nOur schools share this responsibility. When a child walks into a\r\nclassroom, it should be a place of high expectations and high\r\nperformance. But too many schools don't meet this test. That's why\r\ninstead of just pouring money into a system that's not working, we\r\nlaunched a competition called Race to the Top. To all 50 States, we\r\nsaid, \"If you show us the most innovative plans to improve teacher\r\nquality and student achievement, we'll show you the money.\"\r\n\r\nRace to the Top is the most meaningful reform of our public schools in\r\na generation. For less than 1 percent of what we spend on education\r\neach year, it has led over 40 States to raise their standards for\r\nteaching and learning. And these standards were developed, by the way,\r\nnot by Washington, but by Republican and Democratic Governors\r\nthroughout the country. And Race to the Top should be the approach we\r\nfollow this year as we replace No Child Left Behind with a law that's\r\nmore flexible and focused on what's best for our kids.\r\n\r\nYou see, we know what's possible from our children when reform isn't\r\njust a top-down mandate, but the work of local teachers and principals,\r\nschool boards and communities. Take a school like Bruce Randolph in\r\nDenver. Three years ago, it was rated one of the worst schools in\r\nColorado, located on turf between two rival gangs. But last May, 97\r\npercent of the seniors received their diploma. Most will be the first\r\nin their families to go to college. And after the first year of the\r\nschool's transformation, the principal who made it possible wiped away\r\ntears when a student said, \"Thank you, Ms. Waters, for showing that we\r\nare smart and we can make it.\" That's what good schools can do, and we\r\nwant good schools all across the country.\r\n\r\nLet's also remember that after parents, the biggest impact on a child's\r\nsuccess comes from the man or woman at the front of the classroom. In\r\nSouth Korea, teachers are known as nation builders. Here in America,\r\nit's time we treated the people who educate our children with the same\r\nlevel of respect. We want to reward good teachers and stop making\r\nexcuses for bad ones. And over the next 10 years, with so many baby\r\nboomers retiring from our classrooms, we want to prepare 100,000 new\r\nteachers in the fields of science and technology and engineering and\r\nmath.\r\n\r\nIn fact, to every young person listening tonight who's contemplating\r\ntheir career choice: If you want to make a difference in the life of\r\nour Nation, if you want to make a difference in the life of a child,\r\nbecome a teacher. Your country needs you.\r\n\r\nOf course, the education race doesn't end with a high school diploma.\r\nTo compete, higher education must be within the reach of every American.\r\nThat's why we've ended the unwarranted taxpayer subsidies that went to\r\nbanks and used the savings to make college affordable for millions of\r\nstudents. And this year, I ask Congress to go further and make\r\npermanent our tuition tax credit, worth $10,000 for 4 years of college.\r\nIt's the right thing to do.\r\n\r\nBecause people need to be able to train for new jobs and careers in\r\ntoday's fast-changing economy, we're also revitalizing America's\r\ncommunity colleges. Last month, I saw the promise of these schools at\r\nForsyth Tech in North Carolina. Many of the students there used to work\r\nin the surrounding factories that have since left town. One mother of\r\ntwo, a woman named Kathy Proctor, had worked in the furniture industry\r\nsince she was 18 years old. And she told me she's earning her degree in\r\nbiotechnology now, at 55 years old, not just because the furniture jobs\r\nare gone, but because she wants to inspire her children to pursue their\r\ndreams too. As Kathy said, \"I hope it tells them to never give up.\"\r\n\r\nIf we take these steps, if we raise expectations for every child and\r\ngive them the best possible chance at an education, from the day they\r\nare born until the last job they take, we will reach the goal that I\r\nset 2 years ago: By the end of the decade, America will once again have\r\nthe highest proportion of college graduates in the world.\r\n\r\nOne last point about education: Today, there are hundreds of thousands\r\nof students excelling in our schools who are not American citizens.\r\nSome are the children of undocumented workers, who had nothing to do\r\nwith the actions of their parents. They grew up as Americans and pledge\r\nallegiance to our flag, and yet they live every day with the threat of\r\ndeportation. Others come here from abroad to study in our colleges and\r\nuniversities. But as soon as they obtain advanced degrees, we send them\r\nback home to compete against us. It makes no sense.\r\n\r\nNow, I strongly believe that we should take on, once and for all, the\r\nissue of illegal immigration. And I am prepared to work with\r\nRepublicans and Democrats to protect our borders, enforce our laws, and\r\naddress the millions of undocumented workers who are now living in the\r\nshadows. I know that debate will be difficult. I know it will take time.\r\nBut tonight, let's agree to make that effort. And let's stop expelling\r\ntalented, responsible young people who could be staffing our research\r\nlabs or starting a new business, who could be further enriching this\r\nNation.\r\n\r\nThe third step in winning the future is rebuilding America. To attract\r\nnew businesses to our shores, we need the fastest, most reliable ways\r\nto move people, goods, and information, from high-speed rail to high-\r\nspeed Internet.\r\n\r\nOur infrastructure used to be the best, but our lead has slipped. South\r\nKorean homes now have greater Internet access than we do. Countries in\r\nEurope and Russia invest more in their roads and railways than we do.\r\nChina is building faster trains and newer airports. Meanwhile, when our\r\nown engineers graded our Nation's infrastructure, they gave us a D.\r\n\r\nWe have to do better. America is the nation that built the\r\ntranscontinental railroad, brought electricity to rural communities,\r\nconstructed the Interstate Highway System. The jobs created by these\r\nprojects didn't just come from laying down track or pavement. They came\r\nfrom businesses that opened near a town's new train station or the new\r\noff-ramp.\r\n\r\nSo over the last 2 years, we've begun rebuilding for the 21st century,\r\na project that has meant thousands of good jobs for the hard-hit\r\nconstruction industry. And tonight I'm proposing that we redouble those\r\nefforts.\r\n\r\nWe'll put more Americans to work repairing crumbling roads and bridges.\r\nWe'll make sure this is fully paid for, attract private investment, and\r\npick projects based [on]* what's best for the economy, not politicians.\r\n\r\nWithin 25 years, our goal is to give 80 percent of Americans access to\r\nhigh-speed rail. This could allow you to go places in half the time it\r\ntakes to travel by car. For some trips, it will be faster than flying,\r\nwithout the pat-down. [Laughter] As we speak, routes in California and\r\nthe Midwest are already underway.\r\n\r\nWithin the next 5 years, we'll make it possible for businesses to\r\ndeploy the next generation of high-speed wireless coverage to 98\r\npercent of all Americans. This isn't just about--this isn't about\r\nfaster Internet or fewer dropped calls. It's about connecting every\r\npart of America to the digital age. It's about a rural community in\r\nIowa or Alabama where farmers and small-business owners will be able to\r\nsell their products all over the world. It's about a firefighter who\r\ncan download the design of a burning building onto a handheld device, a\r\nstudent who can take classes with a digital textbook, or a patient who\r\ncan have face-to-face video chats with her doctor.\r\n\r\nAll these investments--in innovation, education, and infrastructure--\r\nwill make America a better place to do business and create jobs. But to\r\nhelp our companies compete, we also have to knock down barriers that\r\nstand in the way of their success.\r\n\r\nFor example, over the years, a parade of lobbyists has rigged the Tax\r\nCode to benefit particular companies and industries. Those with\r\naccountants or lawyers to work the system can end up paying no taxes at\r\nall. But all the rest are hit with one of the highest corporate tax\r\nrates in the world. It makes no sense, and it has to change.\r\n\r\nSo tonight I'm asking Democrats and Republicans to simplify the system,\r\nget rid of the loopholes, level the playing field, and use the savings\r\nto lower the corporate tax rate for the first time in 25 years without\r\nadding to our deficit. It can be done.\r\n\r\nTo help businesses sell more products abroad, we set a goal of doubling\r\nour exports by 2014. Because the more we export, the more jobs we\r\ncreate here at home. Already, our exports are up. Recently, we signed\r\nagreements with India and China that will support more than 250,000\r\njobs here in the United States. And last month, we finalized a trade\r\nagreement with South Korea that will support at least 70,000 American\r\njobs. This agreement has unprecedented support from business and labor,\r\nDemocrats and Republicans, and I ask this Congress to pass it as soon\r\nas possible.\r\n\r\nNow, before I took office, I made it clear that we would enforce our\r\ntrade agreements and that I would only sign deals that keep faith with\r\nAmerican workers and promote American jobs. That's what we did with\r\nKorea, and that's what I intend to do as we pursue agreements with\r\nPanama and Colombia and continue our Asia-Pacific and global trade\r\ntalks.\r\n\r\nTo reduce barriers to growth and investment, I've ordered a review of\r\nGovernment regulations. When we find rules that put an unnecessary\r\nburden on businesses, we will fix them. But I will not hesitate to\r\ncreate or enforce commonsense safeguards to protect the American people.\r\nThat's what we've done in this country for more than a century. It's\r\nwhy our food is safe to eat, our water is safe to drink, and our air is\r\nsafe to breathe. It's why we have speed limits and child labor laws.\r\nIt's why last year, we put in place consumer protections against hidden\r\nfees and penalties by credit card companies and new rules to prevent\r\nanother financial crisis. And it's why we passed reform that finally\r\nprevents the health insurance industry from exploiting patients.\r\n\r\nNow, I have heard rumors that a few of you still have concerns about\r\nour new health care law. [Laughter] So let me be the first to say that\r\nanything can be improved. If you have ideas about how to improve this\r\nlaw by making care better or more affordable, I am eager to work with\r\nyou. We can start right now by correcting a flaw in the legislation\r\nthat has placed an unnecessary bookkeeping burden on small businesses.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm not willing to do--what I'm not willing to do--is go back to\r\nthe days when insurance companies could deny someone coverage because\r\nof a preexisting condition.\r\n\r\nI'm not willing to tell James Howard, a brain cancer patient from Texas,\r\nthat his treatment might not be covered. I'm not willing to tell Jim\r\nHouser, a small-businessman from Oregon, that he has to go back to\r\npaying $5,000 more to cover his employees. As we speak, this law is\r\nmaking prescription drugs cheaper for seniors and giving uninsured\r\nstudents a chance to stay on their patients'--parents' coverage.\r\n\r\nSo I say to this Chamber tonight: Instead of refighting the battles of\r\nthe last 2 years, let's fix what needs fixing, and let's move forward.\r\n\r\nNow, the final critical step in winning the future is to make sure we\r\naren't buried under a mountain of debt.\r\n\r\nWe are living with a legacy of deficit spending that began almost a\r\ndecade ago. And in the wake of the financial crisis, some of that was\r\nnecessary to keep credit flowing, save jobs, and put money in people's\r\npockets.\r\n\r\nBut now that the worst of the recession is over, we have to confront\r\nthe fact that our Government spends more than it takes in. That is not\r\nsustainable. Every day, families sacrifice to live within their means.\r\nThey deserve a Government that does the same.\r\n\r\nSo tonight I am proposing that starting this year, we freeze annual\r\ndomestic spending for the next 5 years. Now, this would reduce the\r\ndeficit by more than $400 billion over the next decade and will bring\r\ndiscretionary spending to the lowest share of our economy since Dwight\r\nEisenhower was President.\r\n\r\nThis freeze will require painful cuts. Already, we've frozen the\r\nsalaries of hard-working Federal employees for the next 2 years. I've\r\nproposed cuts to things I care deeply about, like community action\r\nprograms. The Secretary of Defense has also agreed to cut tens of\r\nbillions of dollars in spending that he and his generals believe our\r\nmilitary can do without.\r\n\r\nNow, I recognize that some in this Chamber have already proposed deeper\r\ncuts, and I'm willing to eliminate whatever we can honestly afford to\r\ndo without. But let's make sure that we're not doing it on the backs of\r\nour most vulnerable citizens. And let's make sure that what we're\r\ncutting is really excess weight. Cutting the deficit by gutting our\r\ninvestments in innovation and education is like lightening an\r\noverloaded airplane by removing its engine. It may make you feel like\r\nyou're flying high at first, but it won't take long before you feel the\r\nimpact. [Laughter]\r\n\r\nNow, most of the cuts and savings I've proposed only address annual\r\ndomestic spending, which represents a little more than 12 percent of\r\nour budget. To make further progress, we have to stop pretending that\r\ncutting this kind of spending alone will be enough. It won't.\r\n\r\nThe bipartisan fiscal commission I created last year made this crystal\r\nclear. I don't agree with all their proposals, but they made important\r\nprogress. And their conclusion is that the only way to tackle our\r\ndeficit is to cut excessive spending wherever we find it, in domestic\r\nspending, defense spending, health care spending, and spending through\r\ntax breaks and loopholes.\r\n\r\nThis means further reducing health care costs, including programs like\r\nMedicare and Medicaid, which are the single biggest contributor to our\r\nlong-term deficit. The health insurance law we passed last year will\r\nslow these rising costs, which is part of the reason that nonpartisan\r\neconomists have said that repealing the health care law would add a\r\nquarter of a trillion dollars to our deficit. Still, I'm willing to\r\nlook at other ideas to bring down costs, including one that Republicans\r\nsuggested last year: medical malpractice reform to rein in frivolous\r\nlawsuits.\r\n\r\nTo put us on solid ground, we should also find a bipartisan solution to\r\nstrengthen Social Security for future generations. We must do it\r\nwithout putting at risk current retirees, the most vulnerable, or\r\npeople with disabilities, without slashing benefits for future\r\ngenerations, and without subjecting Americans' guaranteed retirement\r\nincome to the whims of the stock market.\r\n\r\nAnd if we truly care about our deficit, we simply can't afford a\r\npermanent extension of the tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of\r\nAmericans. Before we take money away from our schools or scholarships\r\naway from our students, we should ask millionaires to give up their tax\r\nbreak. It's not a matter of punishing their success, it's about\r\npromoting America's success.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the best thing we could do on taxes for all Americans is to\r\nsimplify the individual Tax Code. This will be a tough job, but members\r\nof both parties have expressed an interest in doing this, and I am\r\nprepared to join them.\r\n\r\nSo now is the time to act. Now is the time for both sides and both\r\nHouses of Congress, Democrats and Republicans, to forge a principled\r\ncompromise that gets the job done. If we make the hard choices now to\r\nrein in our deficits, we can make the investments we need to win the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nLet me take this one step further. We shouldn't just give our people a\r\nGovernment that's more affordable, we should give them a Government\r\nthat's more competent and more efficient. We can't win the future with\r\na Government of the past.\r\n\r\nWe live and do business in the Information Age, but the last major\r\nreorganization of the Government happened in the age of black-and-white\r\nTV. There are 12 different agencies that deal with exports. There are\r\nat least five different agencies that deal with housing policy. Then\r\nthere's my favorite example: The Interior Department is in charge of\r\nsalmon while they're in fresh water, but the Commerce Department\r\nhandles them when they're in saltwater. [Laughter] I hear it gets even\r\nmore complicated once they're smoked. [Laughter]\r\n\r\nNow, we've made great strides over the last 2 years in using technology\r\nand getting rid of waste. Veterans can now download their electronic\r\nmedical records with a click of the mouse. We're selling acres of\r\nFederal office space that hasn't been used in years, and we'll cut\r\nthrough redtape to get rid of more. But we need to think bigger. In the\r\ncoming months, my administration will develop a proposal to merge,\r\nconsolidate, and reorganize the Federal Government in a way that best\r\nserves the goal of a more competitive America. I will submit that\r\nproposal to Congress for a vote, and we will push to get it passed.\r\n\r\nIn the coming year, we'll also work to rebuild people's faith in the\r\ninstitution of Government. Because you deserve to know exactly how and\r\nwhere your tax dollars are being spent, you'll be able to go to a web\r\nsite and get that information for the very first time in history.\r\nBecause you deserve to know when your elected officials are meeting\r\nwith lobbyists, I ask Congress to do what the White House has already\r\ndone: put that information online. And because the American people\r\ndeserve to know that special interests aren't larding up legislation\r\nwith pet projects, both parties in Congress should know this: If a bill\r\ncomes to my desk with earmarks inside, I will veto it. I will veto it.\r\n\r\nThe 21st-century Government that's open and competent, a government\r\nthat lives within its means, an economy that's driven by new skills and\r\nnew ideas--our success in this new and changing world will require\r\nreform, responsibility, and innovation. It will also require us to\r\napproach that world with a new level of engagement in our foreign\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nJust as jobs and businesses can now race across borders, so can new\r\nthreats and new challenges. No single wall separates East and West. No\r\none rival superpower is aligned against us.\r\n\r\nAnd so we must defeat determined enemies, wherever they are, and build\r\ncoalitions that cut across lines of region and race and religion. And\r\nAmerica's moral example must always shine for all who yearn for freedom\r\nand justice and dignity. And because we've begun this work, tonight we\r\ncan say that American leadership has been renewed and America's\r\nstanding has been restored.\r\n\r\nLook to Iraq, where nearly 100,000 of our brave men and women have left\r\nwith their heads held high. American combat patrols have ended,\r\nviolence is down, and a new Government has been formed. This year, our\r\ncivilians will forge a lasting partnership with the Iraqi people, while\r\nwe finish the job of bringing our troops out of Iraq. America's\r\ncommitment has been kept. The Iraq war is coming to an end.\r\n\r\nOf course, as we speak, Al Qaida and their affiliates continue to plan\r\nattacks against us. Thanks to our intelligence and law enforcement\r\nprofessionals, we're disrupting plots and securing our cities and skies.\r\nAnd as extremists try to inspire acts of violence within our borders,\r\nwe are responding with the strength of our communities, with respect\r\nfor the rule of law, and with the conviction that American Muslims are\r\na part of our American family.\r\n\r\nWe've also taken the fight to Al Qaida and their allies abroad. In\r\nAfghanistan, our troops have taken Taliban strongholds and trained\r\nAfghan security forces. Our purpose is clear: By preventing the Taliban\r\nfrom reestablishing a stranglehold over the Afghan people, we will deny\r\nAl Qaida the safe haven that served as a launching pad for 9/11.\r\n\r\nThanks to our heroic troops and civilians, fewer Afghans are under the\r\ncontrol of the insurgency. There will be tough fighting ahead, and the\r\nAfghan Government will need to deliver better governance. But we are\r\nstrengthening the capacity of the Afghan people and building an\r\nenduring partnership with them. This year, we will work with nearly 50\r\ncountries to begin a transition to an Afghan lead, and this July, we\r\nwill begin to bring our troops home.\r\n\r\nIn Pakistan, Al Qaida's leadership is under more pressure than at any\r\npoint since 2001. Their leaders and operatives are being removed from\r\nthe battlefield. Their safe havens are shrinking. And we've sent a\r\nmessage from the Afghan border to the Arabian Peninsula to all parts of\r\nthe globe: We will not relent, we will not waver, and we will defeat\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nAmerican leadership can also be seen in the effort to secure the worst\r\nweapons of war. Because Republicans and Democrats approved the new\r\nSTART Treaty, far fewer nuclear weapons and launchers will be deployed.\r\nBecause we rallied the world, nuclear materials are being locked down\r\non every continent so they never fall into the hands of terrorists.\r\n\r\nBecause of a diplomatic effort to insist that Iran meet its obligations,\r\nthe Iranian Government now faces tougher sanctions, tighter sanctions\r\nthan ever before. And on the Korean Peninsula, we stand with our ally\r\nSouth Korea and insist that North Korea keeps its commitment to abandon\r\nnuclear weapons.\r\n\r\nThis is just a part of how we're shaping a world that favors peace and\r\nprosperity. With our European allies, we revitalized NATO and increased\r\nour cooperation on everything from counterterrorism to missile defense.\r\nWe've reset our relationship with Russia, strengthened Asian alliances,\r\nbuilt new partnerships with nations like India.\r\n\r\nThis March, I will travel to Brazil, Chile, and El Salvador to forge\r\nnew alliances across the Americas. Around the globe, we're standing\r\nwith those who take responsibility, helping farmers grow more food,\r\nsupporting doctors who care for the sick, and combating the corruption\r\nthat can rot a society and rob people of opportunity.\r\n\r\nRecent events have shown us that what sets us apart must not just be\r\nour power; it must also be the purpose behind it. In south Sudan--with\r\nour assistance--the people were finally able to vote for independence\r\nafter years of war. Thousands lined up before dawn. People danced in\r\nthe streets. One man who lost four of his brothers at war summed up the\r\nscene around him. \"This was a battlefield for most of my life,\" he said.\r\n\"Now we want to be free.\"\r\n\r\nAnd we saw that same desire to be free in Tunisia, where the will of\r\nthe people proved more powerful than the writ of a dictator. And\r\ntonight let us be clear: The United States of America stands with the\r\npeople of Tunisia and supports the democratic aspirations of all people.\r\n\r\nWe must never forget that the things we've struggled for and fought for\r\nlive in the hearts of people everywhere. And we must always remember\r\nthat the Americans who have borne the greatest burden in this struggle\r\nare the men and women who serve our country.\r\n\r\nTonight let us speak with one voice in reaffirming that our Nation is\r\nunited in support of our troops and their families. Let us serve them\r\nas well as they've served us, by giving them the equipment they need,\r\nby providing them with the care and benefits that they have earned, and\r\nby enlisting our veterans in the great task of building our own Nation.\r\n\r\nOur troops come from every corner of this country. They're Black, White,\r\nLatino, Asian, Native American. They are Christian and Hindu, Jewish\r\nand Muslim. And yes, we know that some of them are gay. Starting this\r\nyear, no American will be forbidden from serving the country they love\r\nbecause of who they love. And with that change, I call on all our\r\ncollege campuses to open their doors to our military recruiters and\r\nROTC. It is time to leave behind the divisive battles of the past. It\r\nis time to move forward as one Nation.\r\n\r\nWe should have no illusions about the work ahead of us. Reforming our\r\nschools, changing the way we use energy, reducing our deficit, none of\r\nthis will be easy. All of it will take time. And it will be harder\r\nbecause we will argue about everything: the costs, the details, the\r\nletter of every law.\r\n\r\nOf course, some countries don't have this problem. If the central\r\ngovernment wants a railroad, they build a railroad, no matter how many\r\nhomes get bulldozed. If they don't want a bad story in the newspaper,\r\nit doesn't get written.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, as contentious and frustrating and messy as our democracy can\r\nsometimes be, I know there isn't a person here who would trade places\r\nwith any other nation on Earth.\r\n\r\nWe may have differences in policy, but we all believe in the rights\r\nenshrined in our Constitution. We may have different opinions, but we\r\nbelieve in the same promise that says this is a place where you can\r\nmake it if you try. We may have different backgrounds, but we believe\r\nin the same dream that says this is a country where anything is\r\npossible, no matter who you are, no matter where you come from.\r\n\r\nThat dream is why I can stand here before you tonight. That dream is\r\nwhy a working class kid from Scranton can sit behind me. [Laughter]\r\nThat dream is why someone who began by sweeping the floors of his\r\nfather's Cincinnati bar can preside as Speaker of the House in the\r\ngreatest nation on Earth.\r\n\r\nThat dream--that American Dream--is what drove the Allen Brothers to\r\nreinvent their roofing company for a new era. It's what drove those\r\nstudents at Forsyth Tech to learn a new skill and work towards the\r\nfuture. And that dream is the story of a small-business owner named\r\nBrandon Fisher.\r\n\r\nBrandon started a company in Berlin, Pennsylvania, that specializes in\r\na new kind of drilling technology. And one day last summer, he saw the\r\nnews that halfway across the world, 33 men were trapped in a Chilean\r\nmine, and no one knew how to save them.\r\n\r\nBut Brandon thought his company could help. And so he designed a rescue\r\nthat would come to be known as Plan B. His employees worked around the\r\nclock to manufacture the necessary drilling equipment, and Brandon left\r\nfor Chile.\r\n\r\nAlong with others, he began drilling a 2,000-foot hole into the ground,\r\nworking 3 or 4 hour--3 or 4 days at a time without any sleep. Thirty-\r\nseven days later, Plan B succeeded and the miners were rescued. But\r\nbecause he didn't want all of the attention, Brandon wasn't there when\r\nthe miners emerged. He'd already gone back home, back to work on his\r\nnext project.\r\n\r\nAnd later, one of his employees said of the rescue, \"We proved that\r\nCenter Rock is a little company, but we do big things.\"\r\n\r\nWe do big things.\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest days of our founding, America has been the story of\r\nordinary people who dare to dream. That's how we win the future.\r\n\r\nWe're a nation that says, \"I might not have a lot of money, but I have\r\nthis great idea for a new company.\" \"I might not come from a family of\r\ncollege graduates, but I will be the first to get my degree.\" \"I might\r\nnot know those people in trouble, but I think I can help them, and I\r\nneed to try.\" \"I'm not sure how we'll reach that better place beyond\r\nthe horizon, but I know we'll get there. I know we will.\"\r\n\r\nWe do big things.\r\n\r\nThe idea of America endures. Our destiny remains our choice. And\r\ntonight, more than two centuries later, it's because of our people that\r\nour future is hopeful, our journey goes forward, and the state of our\r\nUnion is strong.\r\n\r\nThank you. God bless you, and may God bless the United States of\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\nAddress Before a Joint Session of Congress on the State of the Union\r\nBarack Obama\r\nJanuary 24, 2012\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, distinguished\r\nguests, and fellow Americans: Last month, I went to Andrews Air Force\r\nBase and welcomed home some of our last troops to serve in Iraq.\r\nTogether, we offered a final, proud salute to the colors under which\r\nmore than a million of our fellow citizens fought and several thousand\r\ngave their lives.\r\n\r\nWe gather tonight knowing that this generation of heroes has made the\r\nUnited States safer and more respected around the world. For the first\r\ntime in 9 years, there are no Americans fighting in Iraq. For the first\r\ntime in two decades, Usama bin Laden is not a threat to this country.\r\nMost of Al Qaida's top lieutenants have been defeated. The Taliban's\r\nmomentum has been broken, and some troops in Afghanistan have begun to\r\ncome home.\r\n\r\nThese achievements are a testament to the courage, selflessness, and\r\nteamwork of America's Armed Forces. At a time when too many of our\r\ninstitutions have let us down, they exceed all expectations. They're\r\nnot consumed with personal ambition. They don't obsess over their\r\ndifferences. They focus on the mission at hand. They work together.\r\n\r\nImagine what we could accomplish if we followed their example. Think\r\nabout the America within our reach: a country that leads the world in\r\neducating its people; an America that attracts a new generation of\r\nhigh-tech manufacturing and high-paying jobs; a future where we're in\r\ncontrol of our own energy and our security and prosperity aren't so\r\ntied to unstable parts of the world; an economy built to last, where\r\nhard work pays off and responsibility is rewarded.\r\n\r\nWe can do this. I know we can, because we've done it before. At the end\r\nof World War II, when another generation of heroes returned home from\r\ncombat, they built the strongest economy and middle class the world has\r\never known. My grandfather, a veteran of Patton's army, got the chance\r\nto go to college on the GI bill. My grandmother, who worked on a bomber\r\nassembly line, was part of a workforce that turned out the best\r\nproducts on Earth.\r\n\r\nThe two of them shared the optimism of a nation that had triumphed over\r\na depression and fascism. They understood they were part of something\r\nlarger, that they were contributing to a story of success that every\r\nAmerican had a chance to share, the basic American promise that if you\r\nworked hard, you could do well enough to raise a family, own a home,\r\nsend your kids to college, and put a little away for retirement.\r\n\r\nThe defining issue of our time is how to keep that promise alive. No\r\nchallenge is more urgent. No debate is more important. We can either\r\nsettle for a country where a shrinking number of people do really well\r\nwhile a growing number of Americans barely get by. Or we can restore an\r\neconomy where everyone gets a fair shot and everyone does their fair\r\nshare and everyone plays by the same set of rules. What's at stake\r\naren't Democratic values or Republican values, but American values. And\r\nwe have to reclaim them.\r\n\r\nLet's remember how we got here. Long before the recession, jobs and\r\nmanufacturing began leaving our shores. Technology made businesses more\r\nefficient, but also made some jobs obsolete. Folks at the top saw their\r\nincomes rise like never before, but most hard-working Americans\r\nstruggled with costs that were growing, paychecks that weren't, and\r\npersonal debt that kept piling up.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, the house of cards collapsed. We learned that mortgages had\r\nbeen sold to people who couldn't afford or understand them. Banks had\r\nmade huge bets and bonuses with other people's money. Regulators had\r\nlooked the other way or didn't have the authority to stop the bad\r\nbehavior.\r\n\r\nIt was wrong, it was irresponsible, and it plunged our economy into a\r\ncrisis that put millions out of work, saddled us with more debt, and\r\nleft innocent, hard-working Americans holding the bag. In the 6 months\r\nbefore I took office, we lost nearly 4 million jobs. And we lost\r\nanother 4 million before our policies were in full effect.\r\n\r\nThose are the facts. But so are these: In the last 22 months,\r\nbusinesses have created more than 3 million jobs. Last year, they\r\ncreated the most jobs since 2005. American manufacturers are hiring\r\nagain, creating jobs for the first time since the late 1990s. Together,\r\nwe've agreed to cut the deficit by more than $2 trillion. And we've put\r\nin place new rules to hold Wall Street accountable so a crisis like\r\nthis never happens again.\r\n\r\nThe state of our Union is getting stronger. And we've come too far to\r\nturn back now. As long as I'm President, I will work with anyone in\r\nthis Chamber to build on this momentum. But I intend to fight\r\nobstruction with action, and I will oppose any effort to return to the\r\nvery same policies that brought on this economic crisis in the first\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nNo, we will not go back to an economy weakened by outsourcing, bad debt,\r\nand phony financial profits. Tonight I want to speak about how we move\r\nforward and lay out a blueprint for an economy that's built to last, an\r\neconomy built on American manufacturing, American energy, skills for\r\nAmerican workers, and a renewal of American values.\r\n\r\nNow, this blueprint begins with American manufacturing.\r\n\r\nOn the day I took office, our auto industry was on the verge of\r\ncollapse. Some even said we should let it die. With a million jobs at\r\nstake, I refused to let that happen. In exchange for help, we demanded\r\nresponsibility. We got workers and automakers to settle their\r\ndifferences. We got the industry to retool and restructure. Today,\r\nGeneral Motors is back on top as the world's number-one automaker.\r\nChrysler has grown faster in the U.S. than any major car company. Ford\r\nis investing billions in U.S. plants and factories. And together, the\r\nentire industry added nearly a hundred and sixty thousand jobs.\r\n\r\nWe bet on American workers. We bet on American ingenuity. And tonight,\r\nthe American auto industry is back.\r\n\r\nWhat's happening in Detroit can happen in other industries. It can\r\nhappen in Cleveland and Pittsburgh and Raleigh. We can't bring every\r\njob back that's left our shore. But right now it's getting more\r\nexpensive to do business in places like China. Meanwhile, America is\r\nmore productive. A few weeks ago, the CEO of Master Lock told me that\r\nit now makes business sense for him to bring jobs back home. Today, for\r\nthe first time in 15 years, Master Lock's unionized plant in Milwaukee\r\nis running at full capacity.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo we have a huge opportunity at this moment to bring manufacturing\r\nback. But we have to seize it. Tonight my message to business leaders\r\nis simple: Ask yourselves what you can do to bring jobs back to your\r\ncountry, and your country will do everything we can to help you succeed.\r\n\r\nWe should start with our Tax Code. Right now companies get tax breaks\r\nfor moving jobs and profits overseas. Meanwhile, companies that choose\r\nto stay in America get hit with one of the highest tax rates in the\r\nworld. It makes no sense, and everyone knows it. So let's change it.\r\n\r\nFirst, if you're a business that wants to outsource jobs, you shouldn't\r\nget a tax deduction for doing it. That money should be used to cover\r\nmoving expenses for companies like Master Lock that decide to bring\r\njobs home.\r\n\r\nSecond, no American company should be able to avoid paying its fair\r\nshare of taxes by moving jobs and profits overseas. From now on, every\r\nmultinational company should have to pay a basic minimum tax. And every\r\npenny should go towards lowering taxes for companies that choose to\r\nstay here and hire here in America.\r\n\r\nThird, if you're an American manufacturer, you should get a bigger tax\r\ncut. If you're a high-tech manufacturer, we should double the tax\r\ndeduction you get for making your products here. And if you want to\r\nrelocate in a community that was hit hard when a factory left town, you\r\nshould get help financing a new plant, equipment, or training for new\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\nSo my message is simple: It is time to stop rewarding businesses that\r\nship jobs overseas, and start rewarding companies that create jobs\r\nright here in America. Send me these tax reforms, and I will sign them\r\nright away.\r\n\r\nWe're also making it easier for American businesses to sell products\r\nall over the world. Two years ago, I set a goal of doubling U.S.\r\nexports over 5 years. With the bipartisan trade agreements we signed\r\ninto law, we're on track to meet that goal ahead of schedule. And soon\r\nthere will be millions of new customers for American goods in Panama,\r\nColombia, and South Korea. Soon there will be new cars on the streets\r\nof Seoul imported from Detroit and Toledo and Chicago.\r\n\r\nI will go anywhere in the world to open new markets for American\r\nproducts. And I will not stand by when our competitors don't play by\r\nthe rules. We've brought trade cases against China at nearly twice the\r\nrate as the last administration, and it's made a difference. Over a\r\nthousand Americans are working today because we stopped a surge in\r\nChinese tires. But we need to do more. It's not right when another\r\ncountry lets our movies, music, and software be pirated. It's not fair\r\nwhen foreign manufacturers have a leg up on ours only because they're\r\nheavily subsidized.\r\n\r\nTonight I'm announcing the creation of a trade enforcement unit that\r\nwill be charged with investigating unfair trading practices in\r\ncountries like China. There will be more inspections to prevent\r\ncounterfeit or unsafe goods from crossing our borders. And this\r\nCongress should make sure that no foreign company has an advantage over\r\nAmerican manufacturing when it comes to accessing financing or new\r\nmarkets like Russia. Our workers are the most productive on Earth, and\r\nif the playing field is level, I promise you, America will always win.\r\n\r\nI also hear from many business leaders who want to hire in the United\r\nStates, but can't find workers with the right skills. Growing\r\nindustries in science and technology have twice as many openings as we\r\nhave workers who can do the job. Think about that: openings at a time\r\nwhen millions of Americans are looking for work. It's inexcusable, and\r\nwe know how to fix it.\r\n\r\nJackie Bray is a single mom from North Carolina who was laid off from\r\nher job as a mechanic. Then Siemens opened a gas turbine factory in\r\nCharlotte and formed a partnership with Central Piedmont Community\r\nCollege. The company helped the college design courses in laser and\r\nrobotics training. It paid Jackie's tuition, then hired her to help\r\noperate their plant.\r\n\r\nI want every American looking for work to have the same opportunity as\r\nJackie did. Join me in a national commitment to train 2 million\r\nAmericans with skills that will lead directly to a job. My\r\nadministration has already lined up more companies that want to help.\r\nModel partnerships between businesses like Siemens and community\r\ncolleges in places like Charlotte and Orlando and Louisville are up and\r\nrunning. Now you need to give more community colleges the resources\r\nthey need to become community career centers, places that teach people\r\nskills that businesses are looking for right now, from data management\r\nto high-tech manufacturing.\r\n\r\nAnd I want to cut through the maze of confusing training programs so\r\nthat from now on, people like Jackie have one program, one web site,\r\nand one place to go for all the information and help that they need. It\r\nis time to turn our unemployment system into a reemployment system that\r\nputs people to work.\r\n\r\nThese reforms will help people get jobs that are open today. But to\r\nprepare for the jobs of tomorrow, our commitment to skills and\r\neducation has to start earlier.\r\n\r\nFor less than 1 percent of what our Nation spends on education each\r\nyear, we've convinced nearly every State in the country to raise their\r\nstandards for teaching and learning, the first time that's happened in\r\na generation. But challenges remain, and we know how to solve them.\r\n\r\nAt a time when other countries are doubling down on education, tight\r\nbudgets have forced States to lay off thousands of teachers. We know a\r\ngood teacher can increase the lifetime income of a classroom by over\r\n$250,000. A great teacher can offer an escape from poverty to the child\r\nwho dreams beyond his circumstance. Every person in this Chamber can\r\npoint to a teacher who changed the trajectory of their lives. Most\r\nteachers work tirelessly, with modest pay, sometimes digging into their\r\nown pocket for school supplies, just to make a difference.\r\n\r\nTeachers matter. So instead of bashing them or defending the status quo,\r\nlet's offer schools a deal. Give them the resources to keep good\r\nteachers on the job and reward the best ones. And in return, grant\r\nschools flexibility to teach with creativity and passion, to stop\r\nteaching to the test, and to replace teachers who just aren't helping\r\nkids learn. That's a bargain worth making.\r\n\r\nWe also know that when students don't walk away from their education,\r\nmore of them walk the stage to get their diploma. When students are not\r\nallowed to drop out, they do better. So tonight I am proposing that\r\nevery State--every State--requires that all students stay in high school\r\nuntil they graduate or turn 18.\r\n\r\nWhen kids do graduate, the most daunting challenge can be the cost of\r\ncollege. At a time when Americans owe more in tuition debt than credit\r\ncard debt, this Congress needs to stop the interest rates on student\r\nloans from doubling in July.\r\n\r\nExtend the tuition tax credit we started that saves millions of middle\r\nclass families thousands of dollars and give more young people the\r\nchance to earn their way through college by doubling the number of\r\nwork-study jobs in the next 5 years.\r\n\r\nOf course, it's not enough for us to increase student aid. We can't\r\njust keep subsidizing skyrocketing tuition; we'll run out of money.\r\nStates also need to do their part by making higher education a higher\r\npriority in their budgets. And colleges and universities have to do\r\ntheir part by working to keep costs down.\r\n\r\nRecently, I spoke with a group of college presidents who have done just\r\nthat. Some schools redesign courses to help students finish more\r\nquickly. Some use better technology. The point is, it's possible. So\r\nlet me put colleges and universities on notice: If you can't stop\r\ntuition from going up, the funding you get from taxpayers will go down.\r\nHigher education can't be a luxury. It is an economic imperative that\r\nevery family in America should be able to afford.\r\n\r\nLet's also remember that hundreds of thousands of talented, hard-\r\nworking students in this country face another challenge: the fact that\r\nthey aren't yet American citizens. Many were brought here as small\r\nchildren, are American through and through, yet they live every day\r\nwith the threat of deportation. Others came more recently, to study\r\nbusiness and science and engineering, but as soon as they get their\r\ndegree, we send them home to invent new products and create new jobs\r\nsomewhere else. That doesn't make sense.\r\n\r\nI believe as strongly as ever that we should take on illegal\r\nimmigration. That's why my administration has put more boots on the\r\nborder than ever before. That's why there are fewer illegal crossings\r\nthan when I took office. The opponents of action are out of excuses. We\r\nshould be working on comprehensive immigration reform right now.\r\n\r\nBut if election-year politics keeps Congress from acting on a\r\ncomprehensive plan, let's at least agree to stop expelling responsible\r\nyoung people who want to staff our labs, start new businesses, defend\r\nthis country. Send me a law that gives them the chance to earn their\r\ncitizenship. I will sign it right away.\r\n\r\nYou see, an economy built to last is one where we encourage the talent\r\nand ingenuity of every person in this country. That means women should\r\nearn equal pay for equal work. It means we should support everyone\r\nwho's willing to work and every risk taker and entrepreneur who aspires\r\nto become the next Steve Jobs.\r\n\r\nAfter all, innovation is what America has always been about. Most new\r\njobs are created in startups and small businesses. So let's pass an\r\nagenda that helps them succeed. Tear down regulations that prevent\r\naspiring entrepreneurs from getting the financing to grow. Expand tax\r\nrelief to small businesses that are raising wages and creating good\r\njobs. Both parties agree on these ideas. So put them in a bill and get\r\nit on my desk this year.\r\n\r\nInnovation also demands basic research. Today, the discoveries taking\r\nplace in our federally financed labs and universities could lead to new\r\ntreatments that kill cancer cells, but leave healthy ones untouched,\r\nnew lightweight vests for cops and soldiers that can stop any bullet.\r\nDon't gut these investments in our budget. Don't let other countries\r\nwin the race for the future. Support the same kind of research and\r\ninnovation that led to the computer chip and the Internet, to new\r\nAmerican jobs and new American industries.\r\n\r\nAnd nowhere is the promise of innovation greater than in American-made\r\nenergy. Over the last 3 years, we've opened millions of new acres for\r\noil and gas exploration, and tonight I'm directing my administration to\r\nopen more than 75 percent of our potential offshore oil and gas\r\nresources. Right now--right now--American oil production is the highest\r\nthat it's been in 8 years. That's right, 8 years. Not only that, last\r\nyear, we relied less on foreign oil than in any of the past 16 years.\r\n\r\nBut with only 2 percent of the world's oil reserves, oil isn't enough.\r\nThis country needs an all-out, all-of-the-above strategy that develops\r\nevery available source of American energy, a strategy that's cleaner,\r\ncheaper, and full of new jobs.\r\n\r\nWe have a supply of natural gas that can last America nearly 100 years.\r\nAnd my administration will take every possible action to safely develop\r\nthis energy. Experts believe this will support more than 600,000 jobs\r\nby the end of the decade. And I'm requiring all companies that drill\r\nfor gas on public lands to disclose the chemicals they use. Because\r\nAmerica will develop this resource without putting the health and\r\nsafety of our citizens at risk.\r\n\r\nThe development of natural gas will create jobs and power trucks and\r\nfactories that are cleaner and cheaper, proving that we don't have to\r\nchoose between our environment and our economy. And by the way, it was\r\npublic research dollars, over the course of 30 years, that helped\r\ndevelop the technologies to extract all this natural gas out of shale\r\nrock, reminding us that Government support is critical in helping\r\nbusinesses get new energy ideas off the ground.\r\n\r\nNow, what's true for natural gas is just as true for clean energy. In 3\r\nyears, our partnership with the private sector has already positioned\r\nAmerica to be the world's leading manufacturer of high-tech batteries.\r\nBecause of Federal investments, renewable energy use has nearly doubled,\r\nand thousands of Americans have jobs because of it.\r\n\r\nWhen Bryan Ritterby was laid off from his job making furniture, he said\r\nhe worried that at 55 no one would give him a second chance. But he\r\nfound work at Energetx, a wind turbine manufacturer in Michigan. Before\r\nthe recession, the factory only made luxury yachts. Today, it's hiring\r\nworkers like Bryan, who said, \"I'm proud to be working in the industry\r\nof the future.\"\r\n\r\nOur experience with shale gas, our experience with natural gas, shows\r\nus that the payoffs on these public investments don't always come right\r\naway. Some technologies don't pan out, some companies fail. But I will\r\nnot walk away from the promise of clean energy. I will not walk away\r\nfrom workers like Bryan. I will not cede the wind or solar or battery\r\nindustry to China or Germany because we refuse to make the same\r\ncommitment here.\r\n\r\nWe've subsidized oil companies for a century. That's long enough. It's\r\ntime to end the taxpayer giveaways to an industry that rarely has been\r\nmore profitable and double down on a clean energy industry that never\r\nhas been more promising. Pass clean energy tax credits. Create these\r\njobs.\r\n\r\nWe can also spur energy innovation with new incentives. The differences\r\nin this Chamber may be too deep right now to pass a comprehensive plan\r\nto fight climate change. But there's no reason why Congress shouldn't\r\nat least set a clean energy standard that creates a market for\r\ninnovation. So far, you haven't acted. Well, tonight I will. I'm\r\ndirecting my administration to allow the development of clean energy on\r\nenough public land to power 3 million homes. And I'm proud to announce\r\nthat the Department of Defense, working with us, the world's largest\r\nconsumer of energy, will make one of the largest commitments to clean\r\nenergy in history, with the Navy purchasing enough capacity to power a\r\nquarter of a million homes a year.\r\n\r\nOf course, the easiest way to save money is to waste less energy. So\r\nhere's a proposal: Help manufacturers eliminate energy waste in their\r\nfactories and give businesses incentives to upgrade their buildings.\r\nTheir energy bills will be a hundred billion dollars lower over the\r\nnext decade, and America will have less pollution, more manufacturing,\r\nmore jobs for construction workers who need them. Send me a bill that\r\ncreates these jobs.\r\n\r\nBuilding this new energy future should be just one part of a broader\r\nagenda to repair America's infrastructure. So much of America needs to\r\nbe rebuilt. We've got crumbling roads and bridges, a power grid that\r\nwastes too much energy, an incomplete high-speed broadband network that\r\nprevents a small-business owner in rural America from selling her\r\nproducts all over the world.\r\n\r\nDuring the Great Depression, America built the Hoover Dam and the\r\nGolden Gate Bridge. After World War II, we connected our States with a\r\nsystem of highways. Democratic and Republican administrations invested\r\nin great projects that benefited everybody, from the workers who built\r\nthem to the businesses that still use them today.\r\n\r\nIn the next few weeks, I will sign an Executive order clearing away the\r\nredtape that slows down too many construction projects. But you need to\r\nfund these projects. Take the money we're no longer spending at war,\r\nuse half of it to pay down our debt, and use the rest to do some\r\nnation-building right here at home.\r\n\r\nThere's never been a better time to build, especially since the\r\nconstruction industry was one of the hardest hit when the housing\r\nbubble burst. Of course, construction workers weren't the only ones who\r\nwere hurt. So were millions of innocent Americans who've seen their\r\nhome values decline. And while Government can't fix the problem on its\r\nown, responsible homeowners shouldn't have to sit and wait for the\r\nhousing market to hit bottom to get some relief.\r\n\r\nAnd that's why I'm sending this Congress a plan that gives every\r\nresponsible homeowner the chance to save about $3,000 a year on their\r\nmortgage by refinancing at historically low rates. No more redtape. No\r\nmore runaround from the banks. A small fee on the largest financial\r\ninstitutions will ensure that it won't add to the deficit and will give\r\nthose banks that were rescued by taxpayers a chance to repay a deficit\r\nof trust.\r\n\r\nLet's never forget: Millions of Americans who work hard and play by the\r\nrules every day deserve a Government and a financial system that do the\r\nsame. It's time to apply the same rules from top to bottom. No bailouts,\r\nno handouts, and no copouts. An America built to last insists on\r\nresponsibility from everybody.\r\n\r\nWe've all paid the price for lenders who sold mortgages to people who\r\ncouldn't afford them and buyers who knew they couldn't afford them.\r\nThat's why we need smart regulations to prevent irresponsible behavior.\r\nRules to prevent financial fraud or toxic dumping or faulty medical\r\ndevices, these don't destroy the free market. They make the free market\r\nwork better.\r\n\r\nThere's no question that some regulations are outdated, unnecessary, or\r\ntoo costly. In fact, I've approved fewer regulations in the first 3\r\nyears of my Presidency than my Republican predecessor did in his. I've\r\nordered every Federal agency to eliminate rules that don't make sense.\r\nWe've already announced over 500 reforms, and just a fraction of them\r\nwill save business and citizens more than $10 billion over the next 5\r\nyears. We got rid of one rule from 40 years ago that could have forced\r\nsome dairy farmers to spend $10,000 a year proving that they could\r\ncontain a spill, because milk was somehow classified as an oil. With a\r\nrule like that, I guess it was worth crying over spilled milk.\r\n[Laughter]\r\n\r\nNow, I'm confident a farmer can contain a milk spill without a Federal\r\nagency looking over his shoulder. Absolutely. But I will not back down\r\nfrom making sure an oil company can contain the kind of oil spill we\r\nsaw in the Gulf 2 years ago. I will not back down from protecting our\r\nkids from mercury poisoning or making sure that our food is safe and\r\nour water is clean. I will not go back to the days when health\r\ninsurance companies had unchecked power to cancel your policy, deny\r\nyour coverage, or charge women differently than men.\r\n\r\nAnd I will not go back to the days when Wall Street was allowed to play\r\nby its own set of rules. The new rules we passed restore what should be\r\nany financial system's core purpose: getting funding to entrepreneurs\r\nwith the best ideas and getting loans to responsible families who want\r\nto buy a home or start a business or send their kids to college.\r\n\r\nSo if you are a big bank or financial institution, you're no longer\r\nallowed to make risky bets with your customers' deposits. You're\r\nrequired to write out a \"living will\" that details exactly how you'll\r\npay the bills if you fail, because the rest of us are not bailing you\r\nout ever again. And if you're a mortgage lender or a payday lender or a\r\ncredit card company, the days of signing people up for products they\r\ncan't afford with confusing forms and deceptive practices, those days\r\nare over. Today, American consumers finally have a watchdog in Richard\r\nCordray, with one job: to look out for them.\r\n\r\nWe'll also establish a financial crimes unit of highly trained\r\ninvestigators to crack down on large-scale fraud and protect people's\r\ninvestments. Some financial firms violate major antifraud laws because\r\nthere's no real penalty for being a repeat offender. That's bad for\r\nconsumers, and it's bad for the vast majority of bankers and financial\r\nservice professionals who do the right thing. So pass legislation that\r\nmakes the penalties for fraud count.\r\n\r\nAnd tonight I'm asking my Attorney General to create a special unit of\r\nFederal prosecutors and leading State attorney general to expand our\r\ninvestigations into the abusive lending and packaging of risky\r\nmortgages that led to the housing crisis. This new unit will hold\r\naccountable those who broke the law, speed assistance to homeowners,\r\nand help turn the page on an era of recklessness that hurt so many\r\nAmericans.\r\n\r\nNow, a return to the American values of fair play and shared\r\nresponsibility will help protect our people and our economy. But it\r\nshould also guide us as we look to pay down our debt and invest in our\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nRight now our most immediate priority is stopping a tax hike on a\r\nhundred and sixty million working Americans while the recovery is still\r\nfragile. People cannot afford losing $40 out of each paycheck this year.\r\nThere are plenty of ways to get this done. So let's agree right here,\r\nright now. No side issues. No drama. Pass the payroll tax cut without\r\ndelay. Let's get it done.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to the deficit, we've already agreed to more than $2\r\ntrillion in cuts and savings. But we need to do more, and that means\r\nmaking choices. Right now we're poised to spend nearly $1 trillion more\r\non what was supposed to be a temporary tax break for the wealthiest 2\r\npercent of Americans. Right now because of loopholes and shelters in\r\nthe Tax Code, a quarter of all millionaires pay lower tax rates than\r\nmillions of middle class households. Right now Warren Buffett pays a\r\nlower tax rate than his secretary.\r\n\r\nDo we want to keep these tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans? Or do\r\nwe want to keep our investments in everything else, like education and\r\nmedical research, a strong military and care for our veterans? Because\r\nif we're serious about paying down our debt, we can't do both.\r\n\r\nThe American people know what the right choice is. So do I. As I told\r\nthe Speaker this summer, I'm prepared to make more reforms that rein in\r\nthe long-term costs of Medicare and Medicaid and strengthen Social\r\nSecurity, so long as those programs remain a guarantee of security for\r\nseniors. But in return, we need to change our Tax Code so that people\r\nlike me, and an awful lot of Members of Congress, pay our fair share of\r\ntaxes.\r\n\r\nTax reform should follow the Buffett rule. If you make more than a\r\nmillion dollars a year, you should not pay less than 30 percent in\r\ntaxes. And my Republican friend Tom Coburn is right: Washington should\r\nstop subsidizing millionaires. In fact, if you're earning a million\r\ndollars a year, you shouldn't get special tax subsidies or deductions.\r\nOn the other hand, if you make under $250,000 a year, like 98 percent\r\nof American families, your taxes shouldn't go up. You're the ones\r\nstruggling with rising costs and stagnant wages. You're the ones who\r\nneed relief.\r\n\r\nNow, you can call this class warfare all you want. But asking a\r\nbillionaire to pay at least as much as his secretary in taxes? Most\r\nAmericans would call that common sense.\r\n\r\nWe don't begrudge financial success in this country. We admire it. When\r\nAmericans talk about folks like me paying my fair share of taxes, it's\r\nnot because they envy the rich. It's because they understand that when\r\nI get a tax break I don't need and the country can't afford, it either\r\nadds to the deficit or somebody else has to make up the difference,\r\nlike a senior on a fixed income or a student trying to get through\r\nschool or a family trying to make ends meet. That's not right.\r\nAmericans know that's not right. They know that this generation's\r\nsuccess is only possible because past generations felt a responsibility\r\nto each other and to the future of their country, and they know our way\r\nof life will only endure if we feel that same sense of shared\r\nresponsibility. That's how we'll reduce our deficit. That's an America\r\nbuilt to last.\r\n\r\nNow, I recognize that people watching tonight have differing views\r\nabout taxes and debt, energy and health care. But no matter what party\r\nthey belong to, I bet most Americans are thinking the same thing right\r\nabout now: Nothing will get done in Washington this year or next year\r\nor maybe even the year after that, because Washington is broken.\r\n\r\nCan you blame them for feeling a little cynical?\r\n\r\nThe greatest blow to our confidence in our economy last year didn't\r\ncome from events beyond our control. It came from a debate in\r\nWashington over whether the United States would pay its bills or not.\r\nWho benefited from that fiasco?\r\n\r\nI've talked tonight about the deficit of trust between Main Street and\r\nWall Street. But the divide between this city and the rest of the\r\ncountry is at least as bad, and it seems to get worse every year.\r\n\r\nNow, some of this has to do with the corrosive influence of money in\r\npolitics. So together, let's take some steps to fix that. Send me a\r\nbill that bans insider trading by Members of Congress. I will sign it\r\ntomorrow. Let's limit any elected official from owning stocks in\r\nindustries they impact. Let's make sure people who bundle campaign\r\ncontributions for Congress can't lobby Congress and vice versa, an idea\r\nthat has bipartisan support, at least outside of Washington.\r\n\r\nSome of what's broken has to do with the way Congress does its business\r\nthese days. A simple majority is no longer enough to get anything--even\r\nroutine business--passed through the Senate. Neither party has been\r\nblameless in these tactics. Now both parties should put an end to it.\r\nFor starters, I ask the Senate to pass a simple rule that all judicial\r\nand public service nominations receive a simple up-or-down vote within\r\n90 days.\r\n\r\nThe executive branch also needs to change. Too often, it's inefficient,\r\noutdated, and remote. That's why I've asked this Congress to grant me\r\nthe authority to consolidate the Federal bureaucracy so that our\r\nGovernment is leaner, quicker, and more responsive to the needs of the\r\nAmerican people.\r\n\r\nFinally, none of this can happen unless we also lower the temperature\r\nin this town. We need to end the notion that the two parties must be\r\nlocked in a perpetual campaign of mutual destruction, that politics is\r\nabout clinging to rigid ideologies instead of building consensus around\r\ncommonsense ideas.\r\n\r\nI'm a Democrat, but I believe what Republican Abraham Lincoln believed:\r\nThat Government should do for people only what they cannot do better by\r\nthemselves and no more. That's why my education reform offers more\r\ncompetition and more control for schools and States. That's why we're\r\ngetting rid of regulations that don't work. That's why our health care\r\nlaw relies on a reformed private market, not a Government program.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, even my Republican friends who complain the most\r\nabout Government spending have supported federally financed roads and\r\nclean energy projects and Federal offices for the folks back home.\r\n\r\nThe point is, we should all want a smarter, more effective Government.\r\nAnd while we may not be able to bridge our biggest philosophical\r\ndifferences this year, we can make real progress. With or without this\r\nCongress, I will keep taking actions that help the economy grow. But I\r\ncan do a whole lot more with your help. Because when we act together,\r\nthere's nothing the United States of America can't achieve.\r\n\r\nThat's the lesson we've learned from our actions abroad over the last\r\nfew years. Ending the Iraq war has allowed us to strike decisive blows\r\nagainst our enemies. From Pakistan to Yemen, the Al Qaida operatives\r\nwho remain are scrambling, knowing that they can't escape the reach of\r\nthe United States of America.\r\n\r\nFrom this position of strength, we've begun to wind down the war in\r\nAfghanistan. Ten thousand of our troops have come home. Twenty-three\r\nthousand more will leave by the end of this summer. This transition to\r\nAfghan lead will continue, and we will build an enduring partnership\r\nwith Afghanistan so that it is never again a source of attacks against\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nAs the tide of war recedes, a wave of change has washed across the\r\nMiddle East and North Africa, from Tunis to Cairo, from Sana'a to\r\nTripoli. A year ago, Qadhafi was one of the world's longest serving\r\ndictators, a murderer with American blood on his hands. Today, he is\r\ngone. And in Syria, I have no doubt that the Asad regime will soon\r\ndiscover that the forces of change cannot be reversed and that human\r\ndignity cannot be denied.\r\n\r\nHow this incredible transformation will end remains uncertain. But we\r\nhave a huge stake in the outcome. And while it's ultimately up to the\r\npeople of the region to decide their fate, we will advocate for those\r\nvalues that have served our own country so well. We will stand against\r\nviolence and intimidation. We will stand for the rights and dignity of\r\nall human beings: men and women; Christians, Muslims, and Jews. We will\r\nsupport policies that lead to strong and stable democracies and open\r\nmarkets, because tyranny is no match for liberty.\r\n\r\nAnd we will safeguard America's own security against those who threaten\r\nour citizens, our friends, and our interests. Look at Iran. Through the\r\npower of our diplomacy, a world that was once divided about how to deal\r\nwith Iran's nuclear program now stands as one. The regime is more\r\nisolated than ever before. Its leaders are faced with crippling\r\nsanctions, and as long as they shirk their responsibilities, this\r\npressure will not relent.\r\n\r\nLet there be no doubt: America is determined to prevent Iran from\r\ngetting a nuclear weapon, and I will take no options off the table to\r\nachieve that goal. But a peaceful resolution of this issue is still\r\npossible, and far better. And if Iran changes course and meets its\r\nobligations, it can rejoin the community of nations.\r\n\r\nThe renewal of American leadership can be felt across the globe. Our\r\noldest alliances in Europe and Asia are stronger than ever. Our ties to\r\nthe Americas are deeper. Our ironclad commitment--and I mean ironclad--to\r\nIsrael's security has meant the closest military cooperation between\r\nour two countries in history.\r\n\r\nWe've made it clear that America is a Pacific power, and a new\r\nbeginning in Burma has lit a new hope. From the coalitions we've built\r\nto secure nuclear materials, to the missions we've led against hunger\r\nand disease, from the blows we've dealt to our enemies, to the enduring\r\npower of our moral example, America is back.\r\n\r\nAnyone who tells you otherwise, anyone who tells you that America is in\r\ndecline or that our influence has waned, doesn't know what they're\r\ntalking about. That's not the message we get from leaders around the\r\nworld who are eager to work with us. That's not how people feel from\r\nTokyo to Berlin, from Cape Town to Rio, where opinions of America are\r\nhigher than they've been in years. Yes, the world is changing. No, we\r\ncan't control every event. But America remains the one indispensable\r\nnation in world affairs, and as long as I'm President, I intend to keep\r\nit that way.\r\n\r\nThat's why, working with our military leaders, I've proposed a new\r\ndefense strategy that ensures we maintain the finest military in the\r\nworld, while saving nearly half a trillion dollars in our budget. To\r\nstay one step ahead of our adversaries, I've already sent this Congress\r\nlegislation that will secure our country from the growing dangers of\r\ncyber threats.\r\n\r\nAbove all, our freedom endures because of the men and women in uniform\r\nwho defend it. As they come home, we must serve them as well as they've\r\nserved us. That includes giving them the care and the benefits they\r\nhave earned, which is why we've increased annual VA spending every year\r\nI've been President. And it means enlisting our veterans in the work of\r\nrebuilding our Nation.\r\n\r\nWith the bipartisan support of this Congress, we're providing new tax\r\ncredits to companies that hire vets. Michelle and Jill Biden have\r\nworked with American businesses to secure a pledge of 135,000 jobs for\r\nveterans and their families. And tonight I'm proposing a veterans jobs\r\ncorps that will help our communities hire veterans as cops and\r\nfirefighters, so that America is as strong as those who defend her.\r\n\r\nWhich brings me back to where I began. Those of us who've been sent\r\nhere to serve can learn a thing or two from the service of our troops.\r\nWhen you put on that uniform, it doesn't matter if you're Black or\r\nWhite, Asian, Latino, Native American; conservative, liberal; rich,\r\npoor; gay, straight. When you're marching into battle, you look out for\r\nthe person next to you or the mission fails. When you're in the thick\r\nof the fight, you rise or fall as one unit, serving one nation, leaving\r\nno one behind.\r\n\r\nYou know, one of my proudest possessions is the flag that the SEAL team\r\ntook with them on the mission to get bin Laden. On it are each of their\r\nnames. Some may be Democrats, some may be Republicans, but that doesn't\r\nmatter. Just like it didn't matter that day in the Situation Room, when\r\nI sat next to Bob Gates, a man who was George Bush's Defense Secretary,\r\nand Hillary Clinton, a woman who ran against me for President.\r\n\r\nAll that mattered that day was the mission. No one thought about\r\npolitics. No one thought about themselves. One of the young men\r\ninvolved in the raid later told me that he didn't deserve credit for\r\nthe mission. It only succeeded, he said, because every single member of\r\nthat unit did their job: the pilot who landed the helicopter that spun\r\nout of control, the translator who kept others from entering the\r\ncompound, the troops who separated the women and children from the\r\nfight, the SEALs who charged up the stairs. More than that, the mission\r\nonly succeeded because every member of that unit trusted each other,\r\nbecause you can't charge up those stairs into darkness and danger\r\nunless you know that there's somebody behind you, watching your back.\r\n\r\nSo it is with America. Each time I look at that flag, I'm reminded that\r\nour destiny is stitched together like those 50 stars and those 13\r\nstripes. No one built this country on their own. This Nation is great\r\nbecause we built it together. This Nation is great because we worked as\r\na team. This Nation is great because we get each other's backs. And if\r\nwe hold fast to that truth, in this moment of trial, there is no\r\nchallenge too great, no mission too hard. As long as we are joined in\r\ncommon purpose, as long as we maintain our common resolve, our journey\r\nmoves forward, and our future is hopeful, and the state of our Union\r\nwill always be strong.\r\n\r\nThank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\nAddress Before a Joint Session of Congress on the State of the Union\r\nBarack Obama\r\nFebruary 12, 2013\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease, everybody, have a seat. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President,\r\nMembers of Congress, fellow Americans: Fifty-one years ago, John F.\r\nKennedy declared to this Chamber that \"the Constitution makes us not\r\nrivals for power, but partners for progress.\" \"It is my task,\" he said,\r\n\"to report the state of the Union; to improve it is the task of us\r\nall.\"\r\n\r\nTonight, thanks to the grit and determination of the American people,\r\nthere is much progress to report. After a decade of grinding war, our\r\nbrave men and women in uniform are coming home. After years of grueling\r\nrecession, our businesses have created over 6 million new jobs. We buy\r\nmore American cars than we have in 5 years and less foreign oil than we\r\nhave in 20. Our housing market is healing, our stock market is\r\nrebounding, and consumers, patients, and homeowners enjoy stronger\r\nprotections than ever before.\r\n\r\nSo together, we have cleared away the rubble of crisis, and we can say\r\nwith renewed confidence that the state of our Union is stronger.\r\n\r\nBut we gather here knowing that there are millions of Americans whose\r\nhard work and dedication have not yet been rewarded. Our economy is\r\nadding jobs, but too many people still can't find full-time employment.\r\nCorporate profits have skyrocketed to alltime highs, but for more than\r\na decade, wages and incomes have barely budged.\r\n\r\nIt is our generation's task, then, to reignite the true engine of\r\nAmerica's economic growth: a rising, thriving middle class.\r\n\r\nIt is our unfinished task to restore the basic bargain that built this\r\ncountry: the idea that if you work hard and meet your responsibilities,\r\nyou can get ahead, no matter where you come from, no matter what you\r\nlook like or who you love.\r\n\r\nIt is our unfinished task to make sure that this Government works on\r\nbehalf of the many, and not just the few; that it encourages free\r\nenterprise, rewards individual initiative, and opens the doors of\r\nopportunity to every child across this great Nation.\r\n\r\nThe American people don't expect government to solve every problem.\r\nThey don't expect those of us in this Chamber to agree on every issue.\r\nBut they do expect us to put the Nation's interests before party. They\r\ndo expect us to forge reasonable compromise where we can. For they know\r\nthat America moves forward only when we do so together and that the\r\nresponsibility of improving this Union remains the task of us all.\r\n\r\nNow, our work must begin by making some basic decisions about our\r\nbudget, decisions that will have a huge impact on the strength of our\r\nrecovery.\r\n\r\nOver the last few years, both parties have worked together to reduce\r\nthe deficit by more than $2.5 trillion, mostly through spending cuts,\r\nbut also by raising tax rates on the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans.\r\nAs a result, we are more than halfway towards the goal of $4 trillion\r\nin deficit reduction that economists say we need to stabilize our\r\nfinances.\r\n\r\nNow we need to finish the job. And the question is, how?\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Congress passed a law saying that if both parties couldn't\r\nagree on a plan to reach our deficit goal, about a trillion dollars'\r\nworth of budget cuts would automatically go into effect this year.\r\nThese sudden, harsh, arbitrary cuts would jeopardize our military\r\nreadiness. They'd devastate priorities like education and energy and\r\nmedical research. They would certainly slow our recovery and cost us\r\nhundreds of thousands of jobs. And that's why Democrats, Republicans,\r\nbusiness leaders, and economists have already said that these cuts--\r\nknown here in Washington as the sequester--are a really bad idea.\r\n\r\nNow, some in Congress have proposed preventing only the defense cuts by\r\nmaking even bigger cuts to things like education and job training,\r\nMedicare, and Social Security benefits. That idea is even worse.\r\n\r\nYes, the biggest driver of our long-term debt is the rising cost of\r\nhealth care for an aging population. And those of us who care deeply\r\nabout programs like Medicare must embrace the need for modest reforms;\r\notherwise, our retirement programs will crowd out the investments we\r\nneed for our children and jeopardize the promise of a secure retirement\r\nfor future generations.\r\n\r\nBut we can't ask senior citizens and working families to shoulder the\r\nentire burden of deficit reduction while asking nothing more from the\r\nwealthiest and the most powerful. We won't grow the middle class simply\r\nby shifting the cost of health care or college onto families that are\r\nalready struggling or by forcing communities to lay off more teachers\r\nand more cops and more firefighters. Most Americans--Democrats,\r\nRepublicans, and Independents--understand that we can't just cut our way\r\nto prosperity. They know that broad-based economic growth requires a\r\nbalanced approach to deficit reduction, with spending cuts and revenue\r\nand with everybody doing their fair share. And that's the approach I\r\noffer tonight.\r\n\r\nOn Medicare, I'm prepared to enact reforms that will achieve the same\r\namount of health care savings by the beginning of the next decade as\r\nthe reforms proposed by the bipartisan Simpson-Bowles Commission.\r\n\r\nAlready, the Affordable Care Act is helping to slow the growth of\r\nhealth care costs. And the reforms I'm proposing go even further. We'll\r\nreduce taxpayer subsidies to prescription drug companies and ask more\r\nfrom the wealthiest seniors. We'll bring down costs by changing the way\r\nour Government pays for Medicare, because our medical bills shouldn't\r\nbe based on the number of tests ordered or days spent in the hospital;\r\nthey should be based on the quality of care that our seniors receive.\r\nAnd I am open to additional reforms from both parties, so long as they\r\ndon't violate the guarantee of a secure retirement. Our Government\r\nshouldn't make promises we cannot keep, but we must keep the promises\r\nwe've already made.\r\n\r\nTo hit the rest of our deficit reduction target, we should do what\r\nleaders in both parties have already suggested and save hundreds of\r\nbillions of dollars by getting rid of tax loopholes and deductions for\r\nthe well-off and the well-connected. After all, why would we choose to\r\nmake deeper cuts to education and Medicare just to protect special\r\ninterest tax breaks? How is that fair? Why is it that deficit reduction\r\nis a big emergency justifying making cuts in Social Security benefits,\r\nbut not closing some loopholes? How does that promote growth?\r\n\r\nNow is our best chance for bipartisan, comprehensive tax reform that\r\nencourages job creation and helps bring down the deficit. We can get\r\nthis done. The American people deserve a Tax Code that helps small\r\nbusinesses spend less time filling out complicated forms and more time\r\nexpanding and hiring; a Tax Code that ensures billionaires with high-\r\npowered accountants can't work the system and pay a lower rate than\r\ntheir hard-working secretaries; a Tax Code that lowers incentives to\r\nmove jobs overseas and lowers tax rates for businesses and\r\nmanufacturers that are creating jobs right here in the United States of\r\nAmerica. That's what tax reform can deliver. That's what we can do\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nI realize that tax reform and entitlement reform will not be easy. The\r\npolitics will be hard for both sides. None of us will get a hundred\r\npercent of what we want. But the alternative will cost us jobs, hurt\r\nour economy, visit hardship on millions of hard-working Americans. So\r\nlet's set party interests aside and work to pass a budget that replaces\r\nreckless cuts with smart savings and wise investments in our future.\r\nAnd let's do it without the brinksmanship that stresses consumers and\r\nscares off investors. The greatest nation on Earth cannot keep\r\nconducting its business by drifting from one manufactured crisis to the\r\nnext. We can't do it.\r\n\r\nLet's agree right here, right now to keep the people's Government open\r\nand pay our bills on time and always uphold the full faith and credit\r\nof the United States of America. The American people have worked too\r\nhard, for too long, rebuilding from one crisis to see their elected\r\nofficials cause another.\r\n\r\nNow, most of us agree that a plan to reduce the deficit must be part of\r\nour agenda. But let's be clear: Deficit reduction alone is not an\r\neconomic plan. A growing economy that creates good, middle class jobs,\r\nthat must be the north star that guides our efforts. Every day, we\r\nshould ask ourselves three questions as a nation: How do we attract\r\nmore jobs to our shores? How do we equip our people with the skills\r\nthey need to get those jobs? And how do we make sure that hard work\r\nleads to a decent living?\r\n\r\nNow, a year and a half ago, I put forward an American Jobs Act that\r\nindependent economists said would create more than 1 million new jobs.\r\nAnd I thank the last Congress for passing some of that agenda. I urge\r\nthis Congress to pass the rest. But tonight I'll lay out additional\r\nproposals that are fully paid for and fully consistent with the budget\r\nframework both parties agreed to just 18 months ago. Let me repeat:\r\nNothing I'm proposing tonight should increase our deficit by a single\r\ndime. It is not a bigger Government we need, but a smarter Government\r\nthat sets priorities and invests in broad-based growth. That's what we\r\nshould be looking for.\r\n\r\nOur first priority is making America a magnet for new jobs and\r\nmanufacturing. After shedding jobs for more than 10 years, our\r\nmanufacturers have added about 500,000 jobs over the past 3.\r\nCaterpillar is bringing jobs back from Japan. Ford is bringing jobs\r\nback from Mexico. And this year, Apple will start making Macs in\r\nAmerica again.\r\n\r\nThere are things we can do right now to accelerate this trend. Last\r\nyear, we created our first manufacturing innovation institute in\r\nYoungstown, Ohio. A once-shuttered warehouse is now a state-of-the-art\r\nlab where new workers are mastering the 3-D printing that has the\r\npotential to revolutionize the way we make almost everything. There's\r\nno reason this can't happen in other towns.\r\n\r\nSo tonight I'm announcing the launch of three more of these\r\nmanufacturing hubs, where businesses will partner with the Department\r\nof Defense and Energy to turn regions left behind by globalization into\r\nglobal centers of high-tech jobs. And I ask this Congress to help\r\ncreate a network of 15 of these hubs and guarantee that the next\r\nrevolution in manufacturing is made right here in America. We can get\r\nthat done.\r\n\r\nNow, if we want to make the best products, we also have to invest in\r\nthe best ideas. Every dollar we invested to map the human genome\r\nreturned $140 to our economy--every dollar. Today, our scientists are\r\nmapping the human brain to unlock the answers to Alzheimer's. They're\r\ndeveloping drugs to regenerate damaged organs, devising new materials\r\nto make batteries 10 times more powerful. Now is not the time to gut\r\nthese job-creating investments in science and innovation, now is the\r\ntime to reach a level of research and development not seen since the\r\nheight of the space race. We need to make those investments.\r\n\r\nToday, no area holds more promise than our investments in American\r\nenergy. After years of talking about it, we're finally poised to\r\ncontrol our own energy future. We produce more oil at home than we have\r\nin 15 years. We have doubled the distance our cars will go on a gallon\r\nof gas and the amount of renewable energy we generate from sources like\r\nwind and solar, with tens of thousands of good American jobs to show\r\nfor it. We produce more natural gas than ever before, and nearly\r\neveryone's energy bill is lower because of it. And over the last 4\r\nyears, our emissions of the dangerous carbon pollution that threatens\r\nour planet have actually fallen.\r\n\r\nBut for the sake of our children and our future, we must do more to\r\ncombat climate change. Now, it's true that no single event makes a\r\ntrend. But the fact is, the 12 hottest years on record have all come in\r\nthe last 15. Heat waves, droughts, wildfires, floods--all are now more\r\nfrequent and more intense. We can choose to believe that Superstorm\r\nSandy and the most severe drought in decades and the worst wildfires\r\nsome States have ever seen were all just a freak coincidence. Or we can\r\nchoose to believe in the overwhelming judgment of science and act\r\nbefore it's too late.\r\n\r\nNow, the good news is we can make meaningful progress on this issue\r\nwhile driving strong economic growth. I urge this Congress to get\r\ntogether, pursue a bipartisan, market-based solution to climate change,\r\nlike the one John McCain and Joe Lieberman worked on together a few\r\nyears ago. But if Congress won't act soon to protect future generations,\r\nI will. I will direct my Cabinet to come up with executive actions we\r\ncan take, now and in the future, to reduce pollution, prepare our\r\ncommunities for the consequences of climate change, and speed the\r\ntransition to more sustainable sources of energy.\r\n\r\nAnd 4 years ago, other countries dominated the clean energy market and\r\nthe jobs that came with it. And we've begun to change that. Last year,\r\nwind energy added nearly half of all new power capacity in America. So\r\nlet's generate even more. Solar energy gets cheaper by the year; let's\r\ndrive down costs even further. As long as countries like China keep\r\ngoing all in on clean energy, so must we.\r\n\r\nNow, in the meantime, the natural gas boom has led to cleaner power and\r\ngreater energy independence. We need to encourage that. And that's why\r\nmy administration will keep cutting redtape and speeding up new oil and\r\ngas permits. That's got to be part of an all-of-the-above plan. But I\r\nalso want to work with this Congress to encourage the research and\r\ntechnology that helps natural gas burn even cleaner and protects our\r\nair and our water.\r\n\r\nIn fact, much of our new-found energy is drawn from lands and waters\r\nthat we, the public, own together. So tonight I propose we use some of\r\nour oil and gas revenues to fund an energy security trust that will\r\ndrive new research and technology to shift our cars and trucks off oil\r\nfor good. If a nonpartisan coalition of CEOs and retired generals and\r\nadmirals can get behind this idea, then so can we. Let's take their\r\nadvice and free our families and businesses from the painful spikes in\r\ngas prices we've put up with for far too long.\r\n\r\nI'm also issuing a new goal for America: Let's cut in half the energy\r\nwasted by our homes and businesses over the next 20 years. We'll work\r\nwith the States to do it. Those States with the best ideas to create\r\njobs and lower energy bills by constructing more efficient buildings\r\nwill receive Federal support to help make that happen.\r\n\r\nAmerica's energy sector is just one part of an aging infrastructure\r\nbadly in need of repair. Ask any CEO where they'd rather locate and\r\nhire, a country with deteriorating roads and bridges or one with high-\r\nspeed rail and Internet, high-tech schools, self-healing power grids.\r\nThe CEO of Siemens America--a company that brought hundreds of new jobs\r\nto North Carolina--said that if we upgrade our infrastructure, they'll\r\nbring even more jobs. And that's the attitude of a lot of companies all\r\naround the world. And I know you want these job-creating projects in\r\nyour district. I've seen all those ribbon-cuttings. [Laughter]\r\n\r\nSo tonight I propose a Fix-It-First program to put people to work as\r\nsoon as possible on our most urgent repairs, like the nearly 70,000\r\nstructurally deficient bridges across the country. And to make sure\r\ntaxpayers don't shoulder the whole burden, I'm also proposing a\r\npartnership to rebuild America that attracts private capital to upgrade\r\nwhat our businesses need most: modern ports to move our goods, modern\r\npipelines to withstand a storm, modern schools worthy of our children.\r\nLet's prove there's no better place to do business than here in the\r\nUnited States of America, and let's start right away. We can get this\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nAnd part of our rebuilding effort must also involve our housing sector.\r\nThe good news is, our housing market is finally healing from the\r\ncollapse of 2007. Home prices are rising at the fastest pace in 6 years.\r\nHome purchases are up nearly 50 percent, and construction is expanding\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nBut even with mortgage rates near a 50-year low, too many families with\r\nsolid credit who want to buy a home are being rejected. Too many\r\nfamilies who never missed a payment and want to refinance are being\r\ntold no. That's holding our entire economy back. We need to fix it.\r\n\r\nRight now there's a bill in this Congress that would give every\r\nresponsible homeowner in America the chance to save $3,000 a year by\r\nrefinancing at today's rates. Democrats and Republicans have supported\r\nit before, so what are we waiting for? Take a vote and send me that\r\nbill. Why are--why would we be against that? Why would that be a\r\npartisan issue, helping folks refinance? Right now overlapping\r\nregulations keep responsible young families from buying their first\r\nhome. What's holding us back? Let's streamline the process and help our\r\neconomy grow.\r\n\r\nThese initiatives in manufacturing, energy, infrastructure, housing,\r\nall these things will help entrepreneurs and small-business owners\r\nexpand and create new jobs. But none of it will matter unless we also\r\nequip our citizens with the skills and training to fill those jobs.\r\n\r\nAnd that has to start at the earliest possible age. Study after study\r\nshows that the sooner a child begins learning, the better he or she\r\ndoes down the road. But today, fewer than 3 in 10 4-year-olds are\r\nenrolled in a high-quality preschool program. Most middle class parents\r\ncan't afford a few hundred bucks a week for a private preschool. And\r\nfor poor kids who need help the most, this lack of access to preschool\r\neducation can shadow them for the rest of their lives. So tonight I\r\npropose working with States to make high-quality preschool available to\r\nevery single child in America. That's something we should be able to do.\r\n\r\nEvery dollar we invest in high-quality early childhood education can\r\nsave more than 7 dollars later on: by boosting graduation rates,\r\nreducing teen pregnancy, even reducing violent crime. In States that\r\nmake it a priority to educate our youngest children, like Georgia or\r\nOklahoma, studies show students grow up more likely to read and do math\r\nat grade level, graduate high school, hold a job, form more stable\r\nfamilies of their own. We know this works. So let's do what works and\r\nmake sure none of our children start the race of life already behind.\r\nLet's give our kids that chance.\r\n\r\nLet's also make sure that a high school diploma puts our kids on a path\r\nto a good job. Right now countries like Germany focus on graduating\r\ntheir high school students with the equivalent of a technical degree\r\nfrom one of our community colleges. So those German kids, they're ready\r\nfor a job when they graduate high school. They've been trained for the\r\njobs that are there. Now at schools like P-TECH in Brooklyn, a\r\ncollaboration between New York Public Schools and City University of\r\nNew York and IBM, students will graduate with a high school diploma and\r\nan associate's degree in computers or engineering. We need to give\r\nevery American student opportunities like this.\r\n\r\nAnd 4 years ago, we started Race to the Top, a competition that\r\nconvinced almost every State to develop smarter curricula and higher\r\nstandards, all for about 1 percent of what we spend on education each\r\nyear. Tonight I'm announcing a new challenge to redesign America's high\r\nschools so they better equip graduates for the demands of a high-tech\r\neconomy. And we'll reward schools that develop new partnerships with\r\ncolleges and employers and create classes that focus on science,\r\ntechnology, engineering, and math: the skills today's employers are\r\nlooking for to fill the jobs that are there right now and will be there\r\nin the future.\r\n\r\nNow, even with better high schools, most young people will need some\r\nhigher education. It's a simple fact: The more education you've got,\r\nthe more likely you are to have a good job and work your way into the\r\nmiddle class. But today, skyrocketing costs price too many young people\r\nout of a higher education or saddle them with unsustainable debt.\r\n\r\nThrough tax credits, grants, and better loans, we've made college more\r\naffordable for millions of students and families over the last few\r\nyears. But taxpayers can't keep on subsidizing higher and higher and\r\nhigher costs for higher education. Colleges must do their part to keep\r\ncosts down, and it's our job to make sure that they do.\r\n\r\nSo tonight I ask Congress to change the Higher Education Act so that\r\naffordability and value are included in determining which colleges\r\nreceive certain types of Federal aid. And tomorrow my administration\r\nwill release a new college scorecard that parents and students can use\r\nto compare schools based on a simple criterion: where you can get the\r\nmost bang for your educational buck.\r\n\r\nNow, to grow our middle class, our citizens have to have access to the\r\neducation and training that today's jobs require. But we also have to\r\nmake sure that America remains a place where everyone who's willing to\r\nwork--everybody who's willing to work hard--has the chance to get ahead.\r\n\r\nOur economy is stronger when we harness the talents and ingenuity of\r\nstriving, hopeful immigrants. And right now leaders from the business,\r\nlabor, law enforcement, faith communities, they all agree that the time\r\nhas come to pass comprehensive immigration reform. Now is the time to\r\ndo it. Now is the time to get it done. [Applause] Now is the time to\r\nget it done.\r\n\r\nReal reform means stronger border security, and we can build on the\r\nprogress my administration has already made: putting more boots on the\r\nsouthern border than at any time in our history and reducing illegal\r\ncrossings to their lowest levels in 40 years.\r\n\r\nReal reform means establishing a responsible pathway to earned\r\ncitizenship, a path that includes passing a background check, paying\r\ntaxes and a meaningful penalty, learning English, and going to the back\r\nof the line behind the folks trying to come here legally.\r\n\r\nAnd real reform means fixing the legal immigration system to cut\r\nwaiting periods and attract the highly skilled entrepreneurs and\r\nengineers that will help create jobs and grow our economy.\r\n\r\nIn other words, we know what needs to be done. And as we speak,\r\nbipartisan groups in both Chambers are working diligently to draft a\r\nbill, and I applaud their efforts. So let's get this done. Send me a\r\ncomprehensive immigration reform bill in the next few months, and I\r\nwill sign it right away. And America will be better for it. Let's get\r\nit done. [Applause] Let's get it done.\r\n\r\nBut we can't stop there. We know our economy is stronger when our wives,\r\nour mothers, our daughters can live their lives free from\r\ndiscrimination in the workplace and free from the fear of domestic\r\nviolence. Today the Senate passed the \"Violence Against Women's Act\"\r\nthat Joe Biden originally wrote almost 20 years ago. And I now urge the\r\nHouse to do the same. Good job, Joe. And I ask this Congress to declare\r\nthat women should earn a living equal to their efforts, and finally\r\npass the \"Paycheck Fairness Act\" this year.\r\n\r\nWe know our economy is stronger when we reward an honest day's work\r\nwith honest wages. But today, a full-time worker making the minimum\r\nwage earns $14,500 a year. Even with the tax relief we put in place, a\r\nfamily with two kids that earns the minimum wage still lives below the\r\npoverty line. That's wrong. That's why, since the last time this\r\nCongress raised the minimum wage, 19 States have chosen to bump theirs\r\neven higher.\r\n\r\nTonight let's declare that in the wealthiest nation on Earth, no one\r\nwho works full-time should have to live in poverty and raise the\r\nFederal minimum wage to $9 an hour. We should be able to get that done.\r\n\r\nThis single step would raise the incomes of millions of working\r\nfamilies. It could mean the difference between groceries or the food\r\nbank, rent or eviction, scraping by or finally getting ahead. For\r\nbusinesses across the country, it would mean customers with more money\r\nin their pockets. And a whole lot of folks out there would probably\r\nneed less help from government. In fact, working folks shouldn't have\r\nto wait year after year for the minimum wage to go up while CEO pay has\r\nnever been higher. So here's an idea that Governor Romney and I\r\nactually agreed on last year: Let's tie the minimum wage to the cost of\r\nliving so that it finally becomes a wage you can live on.\r\n\r\nTonight let's also recognize that there are communities in this country\r\nwhere no matter how hard you work, it is virtually impossible to get\r\nahead: factory towns decimated from years of plants packing up;\r\ninescapable pockets of poverty, urban and rural, where young adults are\r\nstill fighting for their first job. America is not a place where the\r\nchance of birth or circumstance should decide our destiny. And that's\r\nwhy we need to build new ladders of opportunity into the middle class\r\nfor all who are willing to climb them.\r\n\r\nLet's offer incentives to companies that hire Americans who've got what\r\nit takes to fill that job opening, but have been out of work so long\r\nthat no one will give them a chance anymore. Let's put people back to\r\nwork rebuilding vacant homes in rundown neighborhoods. And this year,\r\nmy administration will begin to partner with 20 of the hardest hit\r\ntowns in America to get these communities back on their feet. Now,\r\nwe'll work with local leaders to target resources at public safety and\r\neducation and housing.\r\n\r\nWe'll give new tax credits to businesses that hire and invest. And\r\nwe'll work to strengthen families by removing the financial deterrents\r\nto marriage for low-income couples and do more to encourage fatherhood,\r\nbecause what makes you a man isn't the ability to conceive a child,\r\nit's having the courage to raise one. And we want to encourage that. We\r\nwant to help that.\r\n\r\nStronger families. Stronger communities. A stronger America. It is this\r\nkind of prosperity--broad, shared, built on a thriving middle class--that\r\nhas always been the source of our progress at home. It's also the\r\nfoundation of our power and influence throughout the world.\r\n\r\nTonight we stand united in saluting the troops and civilians who\r\nsacrifice every day to protect us. Because of them, we can say with\r\nconfidence that America will complete its mission in Afghanistan and\r\nachieve our objective of defeating the core of Al Qaida.\r\n\r\nAlready, we have brought home 33,000 of our brave service men and women.\r\nThis spring, our forces will move into a support role, while Afghan\r\nsecurity forces take the lead. Tonight I can announce that over the\r\nnext year, another 34,000 American troops will come home from\r\nAfghanistan. This drawdown will continue, and by the end of next year,\r\nour war in Afghanistan will be over.\r\n\r\nBeyond 2014, America's commitment to a unified and sovereign\r\nAfghanistan will endure, but the nature of our commitment will change.\r\nWe're negotiating an agreement with the Afghan Government that focuses\r\non two missions: training and equipping Afghan forces so that the\r\ncountry does not again slip into chaos and counterterrorism efforts\r\nthat allow us to pursue the remnants of Al Qaida and their affiliates.\r\n\r\nToday, the organization that attacked us on 9/11 is a shadow of its\r\nformer self. It's true, different Al Qaida affiliates and extremist\r\ngroups have emerged, from the Arabian Peninsula to Africa. The threat\r\nthese groups pose is evolving. But to meet this threat, we don't need\r\nto send tens of thousands of our sons and daughters abroad or occupy\r\nother nations. Instead, we'll need to help countries like Yemen and\r\nLibya and Somalia provide for their own security and help allies who\r\ntake the fight to terrorists, as we have in Mali. And where necessary,\r\nthrough a range of capabilities, we will continue to take direct action\r\nagainst those terrorists who pose the gravest threat to Americans.\r\n\r\nNow, as we do, we must enlist our values in the fight. That's why my\r\nadministration has worked tirelessly to forge a durable legal and\r\npolicy framework to guide our counterterrorism efforts. Throughout, we\r\nhave kept Congress fully informed of our efforts. I recognize that in\r\nour democracy, no one should just take my word for it that we're doing\r\nthings the right way. So, in the months ahead, I will continue to\r\nengage Congress to ensure not only that our targeting, detention, and\r\nprosecution of terrorists remains consistent with our laws and system\r\nof checks and balances, but that our efforts are even more transparent\r\nto the American people and to the world.\r\n\r\nOf course, our challenges don't end with Al Qaida. America will\r\ncontinue to lead the effort to prevent the spread of the world's most\r\ndangerous weapons. The regime in North Korea must know they will only\r\nachieve security and prosperity by meeting their international\r\nobligations. Provocations of the sort we saw last night will only\r\nfurther isolate them, as we stand by our allies, strengthen our own\r\nmissile defense, and lead the world in taking firm action in response\r\nto these threats.\r\n\r\nLikewise, the leaders of Iran must recognize that now is the time for a\r\ndiplomatic solution, because a coalition stands united in demanding\r\nthat they meet their obligations, and we will do what is necessary to\r\nprevent them from getting a nuclear weapon.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, we'll engage Russia to seek further reductions in our\r\nnuclear arsenals and continue leading the global effort to secure\r\nnuclear materials that could fall into the wrong hands, because our\r\nability to influence others depends on our willingness to lead and meet\r\nour obligations.\r\n\r\nAmerica must also face the rapidly growing threat from cyber attacks.\r\nNow, we know hackers steal people's identities and infiltrate private\r\ne-mails. We know foreign countries and companies swipe our corporate\r\nsecrets. Now our enemies are also seeking the ability to sabotage our\r\npower grid, our financial institutions, our air traffic control systems.\r\nWe cannot look back years from now and wonder why we did nothing in the\r\nface of real threats to our security and our economy.\r\n\r\nAnd that's why, earlier today, I signed a new Executive order that will\r\nstrengthen our cyber defenses by increasing information sharing and\r\ndeveloping standards to protect our national security, our jobs, and\r\nour privacy.\r\n\r\nBut now Congress must act as well, by passing legislation to give our\r\nGovernment a greater capacity to secure our networks and deter attacks.\r\nThis is something we should be able to get done on a bipartisan basis.\r\n\r\nNow, even as we protect our people, we should remember that today's\r\nworld presents not just dangers, not just threats, it presents\r\nopportunities. To boost American exports, support American jobs and\r\nlevel the playing field in the growing markets of Asia, we intend to\r\ncomplete negotiations on a Trans-Pacific Partnership. And tonight I'm\r\nannouncing that we will launch talks on a comprehensive transatlantic\r\ntrade and investment partnership with the European Union, because trade\r\nthat is fair and free across the Atlantic supports millions of good-\r\npaying American jobs.\r\n\r\nWe also know that progress in the most impoverished parts of our world\r\nenriches us all, not only because it creates new markets, more stable\r\norder in certain regions of the world, but also because it's the right\r\nthing to do. In many places, people live on little more than a dollar a\r\nday. So the United States will join with our allies to eradicate such\r\nextreme poverty in the next two decades by connecting more people to\r\nthe global economy, by empowering women, by giving our young and\r\nbrightest minds new opportunities to serve and helping communities to\r\nfeed and power and educate themselves, by saving the world's children\r\nfrom preventable deaths, and by realizing the promise of an AIDS-free\r\ngeneration, which is within our reach.\r\n\r\nYou see, America must remain a beacon to all who seek freedom during\r\nthis period of historic change. I saw the power of hope last year in\r\nRangoon, in Burma, when Aung San Suu Kyi welcomed an American President\r\ninto the home where she had been imprisoned for years; when thousands\r\nof Burmese lined the streets, waving American flags, including a man\r\nwho said: \"There is justice and law in the United States. I want our\r\ncountry to be like that.\"\r\n\r\nIn defense of freedom, we'll remain the anchor of strong alliances from\r\nthe Americas to Africa, from Europe to Asia. In the Middle East, we\r\nwill stand with citizens as they demand their universal rights and\r\nsupport stable transitions to democracy.\r\n\r\nWe know the process will be messy, and we cannot presume to dictate the\r\ncourse of change in countries like Egypt, but we can and will insist on\r\nrespect for the fundamental rights of all people. We'll keep the\r\npressure on a Syrian regime that has murdered its own people and\r\nsupport opposition leaders that respect the rights of every Syrian. And\r\nwe will stand steadfast with Israel in pursuit of security and a\r\nlasting peace.\r\n\r\nThese are the messages I'll deliver when I travel to the Middle East\r\nnext month. And all this work depends on the courage and sacrifice of\r\nthose who serve in dangerous places at great personal risk: our\r\ndiplomats, our intelligence officers, and the men and women of the\r\nUnited States Armed Forces. As long as I'm Commander in Chief, we will\r\ndo whatever we must to protect those who serve their country abroad,\r\nand we will maintain the best military the world has ever known.\r\n\r\nWe'll invest in new capabilities, even as we reduce waste and wartime\r\nspending. We will ensure equal treatment for all servicemembers and\r\nequal benefits for their families, gay and straight. We will draw upon\r\nthe courage and skills of our sisters and daughters and moms, because\r\nwomen have proven under fire that they are ready for combat.\r\n\r\nWe will keep faith with our veterans, investing in world-class care--\r\nincluding mental health care--for our wounded warriors, supporting our\r\nmilitary families, giving our veterans the benefits and education and\r\njob opportunities that they have earned. And I want to thank my wife\r\nMichelle and Dr. Jill Biden for their continued dedication to serving\r\nour military families as well as they have served us. Thank you, honey.\r\nThank you, Jill.\r\n\r\nDefending our freedom, though, is not just the job of our military\r\nalone. We must all do our part to make sure our God-given rights are\r\nprotected here at home. That includes one of the most fundamental\r\nrights of a democracy: the right to vote. Now, when any American, no\r\nmatter where they live or what their party, are denied that right\r\nbecause they can't afford to wait for 5 or 6 or 7 hours just to cast\r\ntheir ballot, we are betraying our ideals.\r\n\r\nSo tonight I'm announcing a nonpartisan commission to improve the\r\nvoting experience in America. And it definitely needs improvement. I'm\r\nasking two long-time experts in the field--who, by the way, recently\r\nserved as the top attorneys for my campaign and for Governor Romney's\r\ncampaign--to lead it. We can fix this, and we will. The American people\r\ndemand it, and so does our democracy.\r\n\r\nOf course, what I've said tonight matters little if we don't come\r\ntogether to protect our most precious resource: our children. It has\r\nbeen 2 months since Newtown. I know this is not the first time this\r\ncountry has debated how to reduce gun violence. But this time is\r\ndifferent. Overwhelming majorities of Americans--Americans who believe\r\nin the Second Amendment--have come together around commonsense reform,\r\nlike background checks that will make it harder for criminals to get\r\ntheir hands on a gun. Senators of both parties are working together on\r\ntough new laws to prevent anyone from buying guns for resale to\r\ncriminals. Police chiefs are asking our help to get weapons of war and\r\nmassive ammunition magazines off our streets, because these police\r\nchiefs, they're tired of seeing their guys and gals being outgunned.\r\n\r\nEach of these proposals deserves a vote in Congress. Now, if you want\r\nto vote no, that's your choice. But these proposals deserve a vote.\r\nBecause in the 2 months since Newtown, more than a thousand birthdays,\r\ngraduations, anniversaries have been stolen from our lives by a bullet\r\nfrom a gun--more than a thousand.\r\n\r\nOne of those we lost was a young girl named Hadiya Pendleton. She was\r\n15 years old. She loved Fig Newtons and lip gloss. She was a majorette.\r\nShe was so good to her friends, they all thought they were her best\r\nfriend. Just 3 weeks ago, she was here, in Washington, with her\r\nclassmates, performing for her country at my Inauguration. And a week\r\nlater, she was shot and killed in a Chicago park after school, just a\r\nmile away from my house.\r\n\r\nHadiya's parents, Nate and Cleo, are in this Chamber tonight, along\r\nwith more than two dozen Americans whose lives have been torn apart by\r\ngun violence. They deserve a vote. They deserve a vote. [Applause] They\r\ndeserve a vote. Gabby Giffords deserves a vote. The families of Newtown\r\ndeserve a vote. The families of Aurora deserve a vote. The families of\r\nOak Creek and Tucson and Blacksburg, and the countless other\r\ncommunities ripped open by gun violence, they deserve a simple vote.\r\nThey deserve a simple vote.\r\n\r\nOur actions will not prevent every senseless act of violence in this\r\ncountry. In fact, no laws, no initiatives, no administrative acts will\r\nperfectly solve all the challenges I've outlined tonight. But we were\r\nnever sent here to be perfect. We were sent here to make what\r\ndifference we can, to secure this Nation, expand opportunity, uphold\r\nour ideals through the hard, often frustrating, but absolutely\r\nnecessary work of self-government.\r\n\r\nWe were sent here to look out for our fellow Americans the same way\r\nthey look out for one another, every single day, usually without\r\nfanfare, all across this country. We should follow their example.\r\n\r\nWe should follow the example of a New York City nurse named Menchu\r\nSanchez. When Hurricane Sandy plunged her hospital into darkness, she\r\nwasn't thinking about how her own home was faring. Her mind was on the\r\n20 precious newborns in her care and the rescue plan she devised that\r\nkept them all safe.\r\n\r\nWe should follow the example of a North Miami woman named Desiline\r\nVictor. When Desiline arrived at her polling place, she was told the\r\nwait to vote might be 6 hours. And as time ticked by, her concern was\r\nnot with her tired body or aching feet, but whether folks like her\r\nwould get to have their say. And hour after hour, a throng of people\r\nstayed in line to support her, because Desiline is 102 years old. And\r\nthey erupted in cheers when she finally put on a sticker that read, \"I\r\nvoted.\" [Applause] There's Desiline.\r\n\r\nWe should follow the example of a police officer named Brian Murphy.\r\nWhen a gunman opened fire on a Sikh temple in Wisconsin and Brian was\r\nthe first to arrive--and he did not consider his own safety. He fought\r\nback until help arrived and ordered his fellow officers to protect the\r\nsafety of the Americans worshiping inside, even as he lay bleeding from\r\n12 bullet wounds. And when asked how he did that, Brian said, \"That's\r\njust the way we're made.\"\r\n\r\nThat's just the way we're made. We may do different jobs and wear\r\ndifferent uniforms and hold different views than the person beside us.\r\nBut as Americans, we all share the same proud title: We are citizens.\r\nIt's a word that doesn't just describe our nationality or legal status.\r\nIt describes the way we're made. It describes what we believe. It\r\ncaptures the enduring idea that this country only works when we accept\r\ncertain obligations to one another and to future generations; that our\r\nrights are wrapped up in the rights of others; and that well into our\r\nthird century as a nation, it remains the task of us all, as citizens\r\nof these United States, to be the authors of the next great chapter of\r\nour American story.\r\n\r\nThank you. God bless you, and God bless these United States of America.\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\nAddress Before a Joint Session of the Congress on the State of the Union\r\nBarack Obama\r\nJanuary 28, 2014\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, my\r\nfellow Americans: Today in America, a teacher spent extra time with a\r\nstudent who needed it and did her part to lift America's graduation\r\nrate to its highest levels in more than three decades. An entrepreneur\r\nflipped on the lights in her tech startup and did her part to add to\r\nthe more than 8 million new jobs our businesses have created over the\r\npast 4 years. An autoworker fine-tuned some of the best, most fuel-\r\nefficient cars in the world and did his part to help America wean\r\nitself off foreign oil.\r\n\r\nA farmer prepared for the spring after the strongest 5-year stretch of\r\nfarm exports in our history. A rural doctor gave a young child the\r\nfirst prescription to treat asthma that his mother could afford. A man\r\ntook the bus home from the graveyard shift, bone-tired, but dreaming\r\nbig dreams for his son. And in tight-knit communities all across\r\nAmerica, fathers and mothers will tuck in their kids, put an arm around\r\ntheir spouse, remember fallen comrades, and give thanks for being home\r\nfrom a war that after 12 long years is finally coming to an end.\r\n\r\nTonight this Chamber speaks with one voice to the people we represent:\r\nIt is you, our citizens, who make the state of our Union strong.\r\n\r\nAnd here are the results of your efforts: the lowest unemployment rate\r\nin over 5 years; a rebounding housing market; a manufacturing sector\r\nthat's adding jobs for the first time since the 1990s; more oil\r\nproduced at home than we buy from the rest of the world, the first time\r\nthat's happened in nearly 20 years; our deficits cut by more than half.\r\nAnd for the first time in over a decade, business leaders around the\r\nworld have declared that China is no longer the world's number-one\r\nplace to invest, America is.\r\n\r\nThat's why I believe this can be a breakthrough year for America. After\r\n5 years of grit and determined effort, the United States is better\r\npositioned for the 21st century than any other nation on Earth.\r\n\r\nThe question for everyone in this Chamber, running through every\r\ndecision we make this year, is whether we are going to help or hinder\r\nthis progress. For several years now, this town has been consumed by a\r\nrancorous argument over the proper size of the Federal Government. It's\r\nan important debate, one that dates back to our very founding. But when\r\nthat debate prevents us from carrying out even the most basic functions\r\nof our democracy--when our differences shut down Government or threaten\r\nthe full faith and credit of the United States--then we are not doing\r\nright by the American people.\r\n\r\nNow, as President, I'm committed to making Washington work better and\r\nrebuilding the trust of the people who sent us here. And I believe most\r\nof you are too. Last month, thanks to the work of Democrats and\r\nRepublicans, Congress finally produced a budget that undoes some of\r\nlast year's severe cuts to priorities like education. Nobody got\r\neverything they wanted, and we can still do more to invest in this\r\ncountry's future while bringing down our deficit in a balanced way, but\r\nthe budget compromise should leave us freer to focus on creating new\r\njobs, not creating new crises.\r\n\r\nAnd in the coming months, let's see where else we can make progress\r\ntogether. Let's make this a year of action. That's what most Americans\r\nwant: for all of us in this Chamber to focus on their lives, their\r\nhopes, their aspirations. And what I believe unites the people of this\r\nNation--regardless of race or region or party, young or old, rich or\r\npoor--is the simple, profound belief in opportunity for all: the notion\r\nthat if you work hard and take responsibility, you can get ahead in\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nNow, let's face it, that belief has suffered some serious blows. Over\r\nmore than three decades, even before the great recession hit, massive\r\nshifts in technology and global competition had eliminated a lot of\r\ngood, middle class jobs and weakened the economic foundations that\r\nfamilies depend on.\r\n\r\nToday, after 4 years of economic growth, corporate profits and stock\r\nprices have rarely been higher, and those at the top have never done\r\nbetter. But average wages have barely budged. Inequality has deepened.\r\nUpward mobility has stalled. The cold, hard fact is that even in the\r\nmidst of recovery, too many Americans are working more than ever just\r\nto get by, let alone to get ahead. And too many still aren't working at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nSo our job is to reverse these trends. It won't happen right away, and\r\nwe won't agree on everything. But what I offer tonight is a set of\r\nconcrete, practical proposals to speed up growth, strengthen the middle\r\nclass, and build new ladders of opportunity into the middle class. Some\r\nrequire congressional action, and I am eager to work with all of you.\r\nBut America does not stand still, and neither will I. So wherever and\r\nwhenever I can take steps without legislation to expand opportunity for\r\nmore American families, that's what I'm going to do.\r\n\r\nAs usual, our First Lady sets a good example. [Applause] Well--\r\n[applause]. Michelle's \"Let's Move!\" partnership with schools,\r\nbusinesses, local leaders has helped bring down childhood obesity rates\r\nfor the first time in 30 years. And that's an achievement that will\r\nimprove lives and reduce health care costs for decades to come. The\r\nJoining Forces alliance that Michelle and Jill Biden launched has\r\nalready encouraged employers to hire or train nearly 400,000 veterans\r\nand military spouses.\r\n\r\nTaking a page from that playbook, the White House just organized a\r\nCollege Opportunity Summit, where already, 150 universities, businesses,\r\nnonprofits have made concrete commitments to reduce inequality in\r\naccess to higher education and to help every hard-working kid go to\r\ncollege and succeed when they get to campus. And across the country,\r\nwe're partnering with mayors, Governors, and State legislatures on\r\nissues from homelessness to marriage equality.\r\n\r\nThe point is, there are millions of Americans outside of Washington who\r\nare tired of stale political arguments and are moving this country\r\nforward. They believe--and I believe--that here in America, our success\r\nshould depend not on accident of birth, but the strength of our work\r\nethic and the scope of our dreams. That's what drew our forebears here.\r\nThat's how the daughter of a factory worker is CEO of America's largest\r\nautomaker; how the son of a barkeep is Speaker of the House; how the\r\nson of a single mom can be President of the greatest nation on Earth.\r\n\r\nOpportunity is who we are. And the defining project of our generation\r\nmust be to restore that promise. We know where to start: The best\r\nmeasure of opportunity is access to a good job. With the economy\r\npicking up speed, companies say they intend to hire more people this\r\nyear. And over half of big manufacturers say they're thinking of\r\ninsourcing jobs from abroad.\r\n\r\nSo let's make that decision easier for more companies. Both Democrats\r\nand Republicans have argued that our Tax Code is riddled with wasteful,\r\ncomplicated loopholes that punish businesses investing here and reward\r\ncompanies that keep profits abroad. Let's flip that equation. Let's\r\nwork together to close those loopholes, end those incentives to ship\r\njobs overseas, and lower tax rates for businesses that create jobs\r\nright here at home.\r\n\r\nMoreover, we can take the money we save from this transition to tax\r\nreform to create jobs rebuilding our roads, upgrading our ports,\r\nunclogging our commutes, because in today's global economy, first-class\r\njobs gravitate to first-class infrastructure. We'll need Congress to\r\nprotect more than 3 million jobs by finishing transportation and\r\nwaterways bills this summer. That can happen. But I'll act on my own to\r\nslash bureaucracy and streamline the permitting process for key\r\nprojects so we can get more construction workers on the job as fast as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nWe also have the chance, right now, to beat other countries in the race\r\nfor the next wave of high-tech manufacturing jobs. My administration\r\nhas launched two hubs for high-tech manufacturing in Raleigh, North\r\nCarolina, and Youngstown, Ohio, where we've connected businesses to\r\nresearch universities that can help America lead the world in advanced\r\ntechnologies. Tonight I'm announcing, we'll launch six more this year.\r\nBipartisan bills in both Houses could double the number of these hubs\r\nand the jobs they create. So get those bills to my desk. Put more\r\nAmericans back to work.\r\n\r\nLet's do more to help the entrepreneurs and small-business owners who\r\ncreate most new jobs in America. Over the past 5 years, my\r\nadministration has made more loans to small-business owners than any\r\nother. And when 98 percent of our exporters are small businesses, new\r\ntrade partnerships with Europe and Asia--the Asia-Pacific will help them\r\ncreate more jobs. We need to work together on tools like bipartisan\r\ntrade promotion authority to protect our workers, protect our\r\nenvironment, and open new markets to new goods stamped \"Made in the\r\nU.S.A.\"\r\n\r\nListen, China and Europe aren't standing on the sidelines, and neither\r\nshould we. We know that the nation that goes all-in on innovation today\r\nwill own the global economy tomorrow. This is an edge America cannot\r\nsurrender. Federally funded research helped lead to the ideas and\r\ninventions behind Google and smartphones. And that's why Congress\r\nshould undo the damage done by last year's cuts to basic research so we\r\ncan unleash the next great American discovery. There are entire\r\nindustries to be built based on vaccines that stay ahead of drug-\r\nresistant bacteria or paper-thin material that's stronger than steel.\r\nAnd let's pass a patent reform bill that allows our businesses to stay\r\nfocused on innovation, not costly and needless litigation.\r\n\r\nNow, one of the biggest factors in bringing more jobs back is our\r\ncommitment to American energy. The all-of-the-above energy strategy I\r\nannounced a few years ago is working, and today, America is closer to\r\nenergy independence than we have been in decades.\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons why is natural gas. If extracted safely, it's the\r\nbridge fuel that can power our economy with less of the carbon\r\npollution that causes climate change. Businesses plan to invest almost\r\n$100 billion in new factories that use natural gas. I'll cut redtape to\r\nhelp States get those factories built and put folks to work, and this\r\nCongress can help by putting people to work building fueling stations\r\nthat shift more cars and trucks from foreign oil to American natural\r\ngas.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, my administration will keep working with the industry to\r\nsustain production and jobs growth while strengthening protection of\r\nour air, our water, our communities. And while we're at it, I'll use my\r\nauthority to protect more of our pristine Federal lands for future\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\nWell, it's not just oil and natural gas production that's booming,\r\nwe're becoming a global leader in solar too. Every 4 minutes, another\r\nAmerican home or business goes solar, every panel pounded into place by\r\na worker whose job cannot be outsourced. Let's continue that progress\r\nwith a smarter tax policy that stops giving $4 billion a year to fossil\r\nfuel industries that don't need it so we can invest more in fuels of\r\nthe future that do.\r\n\r\nAnd even as we've increased energy production, we've partnered with\r\nbusinesses, builders, and local communities to reduce the energy we\r\nconsume. When we rescued our automakers, for example, we worked with\r\nthem to set higher fuel efficiency standards for our cars. In the\r\ncoming months, I'll build on that success by setting new standards for\r\nour trucks so we can keep driving down oil imports and what we pay at\r\nthe pump.\r\n\r\nAnd taken together, our energy policy is creating jobs and leading to a\r\ncleaner, safer planet. Over the past 8 years, the United States has\r\nreduced our total carbon pollution more than any other nation on Earth.\r\nBut we have to act with more urgency, because a changing climate is\r\nalready harming Western communities struggling with drought and coastal\r\ncities dealing with floods. That's why I directed my administration to\r\nwork with States, utilities, and others to set new standards on the\r\namount of carbon pollution our power plants are allowed to dump into\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\nThe shift to a cleaner energy economy won't happen overnight, and it\r\nwill require some tough choices along the way. But the debate is\r\nsettled. Climate change is a fact. And when our children's children\r\nlook us in the eye and ask if we did all we could to leave them a safer,\r\nmore stable world, with new sources of energy, I want us to be able to\r\nsay, yes, we did.\r\n\r\nFinally, if we're serious about economic growth, it is time to heed the\r\ncall of business leaders, labor leaders, faith leaders, law enforcement\r\nand fix our broken immigration system. Republicans and Democrats in the\r\nSenate have acted, and I know that members of both parties in the House\r\nwant to do the same. Independent economists say immigration reform will\r\ngrow our economy and shrink our deficits by almost $1 trillion in the\r\nnext two decades. And for good reason: When people come here to fulfill\r\ntheir dreams--to study, invent, contribute to our culture--they make our\r\ncountry a more attractive place for businesses to locate and create\r\njobs for everybody. So let's get immigration reform done this year.\r\n[Applause] Let's get it done. It's time.\r\n\r\nThe ideas I've outlined so far can speed up growth and create more jobs.\r\nBut in this rapidly changing economy, we have to make sure that every\r\nAmerican has the skills to fill those jobs. The good news is, we know\r\nhow to do it.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago, as the auto industry came roaring back, Andra Rush\r\nopened up a manufacturing firm in Detroit. She knew that Ford needed\r\nparts for the best selling truck in America, and she knew how to make\r\nthose parts. She just needed the workforce. So she dialed up what we\r\ncall an American Job Center, places where folks can walk in to get the\r\nhelp or training they need to find a new job or a better job. She was\r\nflooded with new workers. And today, Detroit Manufacturing Systems has\r\nmore than 700 employees. And what Andra and her employees experienced\r\nis how it should be for every employer and every job seeker.\r\n\r\nSo tonight I've asked Vice President Biden to lead an across-the-board\r\nreform of America's training programs to make sure they have one\r\nmission: train Americans with the skills employers need and match them\r\nto good jobs that need to be filled right now. That means more on-the-\r\njob training and more apprenticeships that set a young worker on an\r\nupward trajectory for life. It means connecting companies to community\r\ncolleges that can help design training to fill their specific needs.\r\nAnd if Congress wants to help, you can concentrate funding on proven\r\nprograms that connect more ready-to-work Americans with ready-to-be-\r\nfilled jobs.\r\n\r\nI'm also convinced we can help Americans return to the workforce faster\r\nby reforming unemployment insurance so that it's more effective in\r\ntoday's economy. But first, this Congress needs to restore the\r\nunemployment insurance you just let expire for 1.6 million people.\r\n\r\nLet me tell you why. Misty DeMars is a mother of two young boys. She'd\r\nbeen steadily employed since she was a teenager, put herself through\r\ncollege. She'd never collected unemployment benefits, but she'd been\r\npaying taxes. In May, she and her husband used their life savings to\r\nbuy their first home. A week later, budget cuts claimed the job she\r\nloved. Last month, when their unemployment insurance was cut off, she\r\nsat down and wrote me a letter, the kind I get every day. \"We are the\r\nface of the unemployment crisis,\" she wrote. \"I'm not dependent on the\r\ngovernment. Our country depends on people like us who build careers,\r\ncontribute to society, care about our neighbors. I'm confident that in\r\ntime, I will find a job, I will pay my taxes, and we will raise our\r\nchildren in their own home in the community we love. Please give us\r\nthis chance.\"\r\n\r\nCongress, give these hard-working, responsible Americans that chance.\r\nGive them that chance. [Applause] Give them the chance. They need our\r\nhelp right now. But more important, this country needs them in the game.\r\nThat's why I've been asking CEOs to give more long-term unemployed\r\nworkers a fair shot at new jobs, a new chance to support their families.\r\nAnd in fact, this week, many will come to the White House to make that\r\ncommitment real. Tonight I ask every business leader in America to join\r\nus and to do the same, because we are stronger when America fields a\r\nfull team.\r\n\r\nOf course, it's not enough to train today's workforce. We also have to\r\nprepare tomorrow's workforce, by guaranteeing every child access to a\r\nworld-class education. Estiven Rodriguez couldn't speak a word of\r\nEnglish when he moved to New York City at age 9. But last month, thanks\r\nto the support of great teachers and an innovative tutoring program, he\r\nled a march of his classmates through a crowd of cheering parents and\r\nneighbors from their high school to the post office, where they mailed\r\noff their college applications. And this son of a factory worker just\r\nfound out, he's going to college this fall.\r\n\r\nFive years ago, we set out to change the odds for all our kids. We\r\nworked with lenders to reform student loans, and today, more young\r\npeople are earning college degrees than ever before. Race to the Top,\r\nwith the help of Governors from both parties, has helped States raise\r\nexpectations and performance. Teachers and principals in schools from\r\nTennessee to Washington, DC, are making big strides in preparing\r\nstudents with the skills for the new economy: problem solving, critical\r\nthinking, science, technology, engineering, math.\r\n\r\nNow, some of this change is hard. It requires everything from more\r\nchallenging curriculums and more demanding parents to better support\r\nfor teachers and new ways to measure how well our kids think, not how\r\nwell they can fill in a bubble on a test. But it is worth it, and it is\r\nworking. The problem is, we're still not reaching enough kids, and\r\nwe're not reaching them in time. And that has to change.\r\n\r\nResearch shows that one of the best investments we can make in a\r\nchild's life is high-quality early education. Last year, I asked this\r\nCongress to help States make high-quality pre-K available to every 4-\r\nyear-old. And as a parent as well as a President, I repeat that request\r\ntonight. But in the meantime, 30 States have raised pre-K funding on\r\ntheir own. They know we can't wait. So just as we worked with States to\r\nreform our schools, this year, we'll invest in new partnerships with\r\nStates and communities across the country in a Race to the Top for our\r\nyoungest children. And as Congress decides what it's going to do, I'm\r\ngoing to pull together a coalition of elected officials, business\r\nleaders, and philanthropists willing to help more kids access the high-\r\nquality pre-K that they need. It is right for America. We need to get\r\nthis done.\r\n\r\nLast year, I also pledged to connect 99 percent of our students to\r\nhigh-speed broadband over the next 4 years. Tonight I can announce that\r\nwith the support of the FCC and companies like Apple, Microsoft, Sprint,\r\nand Verizon, we've got a down payment to start connecting more than\r\n15,000 schools and 20 million students over the next 2 years, without\r\nadding a dime to the deficit.\r\n\r\nWe're working to redesign high schools and partner them with colleges\r\nand employers that offer the real-world education and hands-on training\r\nthat can lead directly to a job and career. We're shaking up our system\r\nof higher education to give parents more information and colleges more\r\nincentive to offer better value so that no middle class kid is priced\r\nout of a college education.\r\n\r\nWe're offering millions the opportunity to cap their monthly student\r\nloan payments to 10 percent of their income, and I want to work with\r\nCongress to see how we can help even more Americans who feel trapped by\r\nstudent loan debt. And I'm reaching out to some of America's leading\r\nfoundations and corporations on a new initiative to help more young men\r\nof color facing especially tough odds to stay on track and reach their\r\nfull potential.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line is, Michelle and I want every child to have the same\r\nchance this country gave us. But we know our opportunity agenda won't\r\nbe complete, and too many young people entering the workforce today\r\nwill see the American Dream as an empty promise, unless we also do more\r\nto make sure our economy honors the dignity of work and hard work pays\r\noff for every single American.\r\n\r\nToday, women make up about half our workforce, but they still make 77\r\ncents for every dollar a man earns. That is wrong, and in 2014, it's an\r\nembarrassment. Women deserve equal pay for equal work. She deserves to\r\nhave a baby without sacrificing her job. A mother deserves a day off to\r\ncare for a sick child or a sick parent without running into hardship.\r\nAnd you know what, a father does too. It is time to do away with\r\nworkplace policies that belong in a \"Mad Men\" episode. [Laughter] This\r\nyear, let's all come together--Congress, the White House, businesses\r\nfrom Wall Street to Main Street--to give every woman the opportunity she\r\ndeserves. Because I believe when women succeed, America succeeds.\r\n\r\nNow, women hold a majority of lower wage jobs, but they're not the only\r\nones stifled by stagnant wages. Americans understand that some people\r\nwill earn more money than others, and we don't resent those who, by\r\nvirtue of their efforts, achieve incredible success. That's what\r\nAmerica is all about. But Americans overwhelmingly agree that no one\r\nwho works full-time should ever have to raise a family in poverty.\r\n\r\nIn the year since I asked this Congress to raise the minimum wage, five\r\nStates have passed laws to raise theirs. Many businesses have done it\r\non their own. Nick Chute is here today with his boss, John Soranno.\r\nJohn's an owner of Punch Pizza in Minneapolis, and Nick helps make the\r\ndough. [Laughter] Only now he makes more of it. [Laughter] John just\r\ngave his employees a raise to 10 bucks an hour, and that's a decision\r\nthat has eased their financial stress and boosted their morale.\r\n\r\nTonight I ask more of America's business leaders to follow John's lead:\r\nDo what you can to raise your employees' wages. It's good for the\r\neconomy. It's good for America. To every mayor, Governor, State\r\nlegislator in America, I say: You don't have to wait for Congress to\r\nact; Americans will support you if you take this on.\r\n\r\nAnd as a chief executive, I intend to lead by example. Profitable\r\ncorporations like Costco see higher wages as the smart way to boost\r\nproductivity and reduce turnover. We should too. In the coming weeks, I\r\nwill issue an Executive order requiring Federal contractors to pay\r\ntheir federally funded employees a fair wage of at least 10 dollars and\r\n10 cents an hour. Because if you cook our troops' meals or wash their\r\ndishes, you should not have to live in poverty.\r\n\r\nOf course, to reach millions more, Congress does need to get on board.\r\nToday, the Federal minimum wage is worth about 20 percent less than it\r\nwas when Ronald Reagan first stood here. And Tom Harkin and George\r\nMiller have a bill to fix that by lifting the minimum wage to 10\r\ndollars and 10 cents. It's easy to remember: 10-10. This will help\r\nfamilies. It will give businesses customers with more money to spend.\r\nIt does not involve any new bureaucratic program. So join the rest of\r\nthe country. Say yes. Give America a raise. Give them a raise.\r\n\r\nThere are other steps we can take to help families make ends meet, and\r\nfew are more effective at reducing inequality and helping families pull\r\nthemselves up through hard work than the earned-income tax credit.\r\nRight now it helps about half of all parents at some point. Think about\r\nthat: It helps about half of all parents in America at some point in\r\ntheir lives. But I agree with Republicans like Senator Rubio that it\r\ndoesn't do enough for single workers who don't have kids. So let's work\r\ntogether to strengthen the credit, reward work, help more Americans get\r\nahead.\r\n\r\nLet's do more to help Americans save for retirement. Today, most\r\nworkers don't have a pension. A Social Security check often isn't\r\nenough on its own. And while the stock market has doubled over the last\r\n5 years, that doesn't help folks who don't have 401(k)s. That's why,\r\ntomorrow, I will direct the Treasury to create a new way for working\r\nAmericans to start their own retirement savings: MyI--MyRA.\r\n\r\nIt's a new savings bond that encourages folks to build a nest egg. MyRA\r\nguarantees a decent return with no risk of losing what you put in. And\r\nif this Congress wants to help, work with me to fix an upside-down Tax\r\nCode that gives big tax breaks to help the wealthy save, but does\r\nlittle or nothing for middle class Americans. Offer every American\r\naccess to an automatic IRA on the job so they can save at work just\r\nlike everybody in this Chamber can.\r\n\r\nAnd since the most important investment many families make is their\r\nhome, send me legislation that protects taxpayers from footing the bill\r\nfor a housing crisis ever again and keeps the dream of homeownership\r\nalive for future generations.\r\n\r\nOne last point on financial security: For decades, few things exposed\r\nhard-working families to economic hardship more than a broken health\r\ncare system. And in case you haven't heard, we're in the process of\r\nfixing that. Now, a preexisting condition used to mean that someone\r\nlike Amanda Shelley, a physician's assistant and single mom from\r\nArizona, couldn't get health insurance. But on January 1, she got\r\ncovered. On January 3, she felt a sharp pain. On January 6, she had\r\nemergency surgery. Just one week earlier, Amanda said, and that surgery\r\nwould have meant bankruptcy.\r\n\r\nThat's what health insurance reform is all about: the peace of mind\r\nthat if misfortune strikes, you don't have to lose everything. Already,\r\nbecause of the Affordable Care Act, more than 3 million Americans under\r\nage 26 have gained coverage under their parent's plan. More than 9\r\nmillion Americans have signed up for private health insurance or\r\nMedicaid coverage. Nine million.\r\n\r\nAnd here's another number: zero. Because of this law, no American--none,\r\nzero--can ever again be dropped or denied coverage for a preexisting\r\ncondition like asthma or back pain or cancer. No woman can ever be\r\ncharged more just because she's a woman. And we did all this while\r\nadding years to Medicare's finances, keeping Medicare premiums flat,\r\nand lowering prescription costs for millions of seniors.\r\n\r\nNow, I do not expect to convince my Republican friends on the merits of\r\nthis law. [Laughter] But I know that the American people are not\r\ninterested in refighting old battles. So again, if you have specific\r\nplans to cut costs, cover more people, increase choice, tell America\r\nwhat you'd do differently. Let's see if the numbers add up. But let's\r\nnot have another 40-something votes to repeal a law that's already\r\nhelping millions of Americans like Amanda. The first 40 were plenty.\r\n[Laughter]\r\n\r\nWe all owe it to the American people to say what we're for, not just\r\nwhat we're against. And if you want to know the real impact this law is\r\nhaving, just talk to Governor Steve Beshear of Kentucky, who's here\r\ntonight. Now, Kentucky is not the most liberal part of the country.\r\nThat's not where I got my highest vote totals. [Laughter] But he's like\r\na man possessed when it comes to covering his Commonwealth's families.\r\nThey're our neighbors and our friends, he said: \"They're people we shop\r\nand go to church with, farmers out on the tractor, grocery clerks.\r\nThey're people who go to work every morning praying they don't get sick.\r\nNo one deserves to live that way.\"\r\n\r\nSteve's right. That's why tonight I ask every American who knows\r\nsomeone without health insurance to help them get covered by March 31.\r\n[Applause] Help them get covered. Moms, get on your kids to sign up.\r\nKids, call your mom and walk her through the application. It will give\r\nher some peace of mind, and plus, she'll appreciate hearing from you.\r\n[Laughter]\r\n\r\nAfter all, that's the spirit that has always moved this Nation forward.\r\nIt's the spirit of citizenship, the recognition that through hard work\r\nand responsibility, we can pursue our individual dreams, but still come\r\ntogether as one American family to make sure the next generation can\r\npursue its dreams as well.\r\n\r\nCitizenship means standing up for everyone's right to vote. Last year,\r\npart of the Voting Rights Act was weakened, but conservative\r\nRepublicans and liberal Democrats are working together to strengthen it.\r\nAnd the bipartisan Commission I appointed, chaired by my campaign\r\nlawyer and Governor Romney's campaign lawyer, came together and have\r\noffered reforms so that no one has to wait more than a half hour to\r\nvote. Let's support these efforts. It should be the power of our vote,\r\nnot the size of our bank accounts, that drives our democracy.\r\n\r\nCitizenship means standing up for the lives that gun violence steals\r\nfrom us each day. I've seen the courage of parents, students, pastors,\r\npolice officers all over this country who say, \"We are not afraid.\" And\r\nI intend to keep trying, with or without Congress, to help stop more\r\ntragedies from visiting innocent Americans in our movie theaters, in\r\nour shopping malls, or schools like Sandy Hook.\r\n\r\nCitizenship demands a sense of common purpose, participation in the\r\nhard work of self-government, an obligation to serve our communities.\r\nAnd I know this Chamber agrees that few Americans give more to their\r\ncountry than our diplomats and the men and women of the United States\r\nArmed Forces. Thank you. Tonight, because of the extraordinary troops\r\nand civilians who risk and lay down their lives to keep us free, the\r\nUnited States is more secure. When I took office, nearly 180,000\r\nAmericans were serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. Today, all our troops\r\nare out of Iraq. More than 60,000 of our troops have already come home\r\nfrom Afghanistan. With Afghan forces now in the lead for their own\r\nsecurity, our troops have moved to a support role. Together with our\r\nallies, we will complete our mission there by the end of this year, and\r\nAmerica's longest war will finally be over.\r\n\r\nAfter 2014, we will support a unified Afghanistan as it takes\r\nresponsibility for its own future. If the Afghan Government signs a\r\nsecurity agreement that we have negotiated, a small force of Americans\r\ncould remain in Afghanistan with NATO allies to carry out two narrow\r\nmissions: training and assisting Afghan forces and counterterrorism\r\noperations to pursue any remnants of Al Qaida. For while our\r\nrelationship with Afghanistan will change, one thing will not: our\r\nresolve that terrorists do not launch attacks against our country.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, that danger remains. While we've put Al Qaida's core\r\nleadership on a path to defeat, the threat has evolved as Al Qaida\r\naffiliates and other extremists take root in different parts of the\r\nworld. In Yemen, Somalia, Iraq, Mali, we have to keep working with\r\npartners to disrupt and disable those networks. In Syria, we'll support\r\nthe opposition that rejects the agenda of terrorist networks. Here at\r\nhome, we'll keep strengthening our defenses and combat new threats like\r\ncyber attacks. And as we reform our defense budget, we will have to\r\nkeep faith with our men and women in uniform and invest in the\r\ncapabilities they need to succeed in future missions.\r\n\r\nWe have to remain vigilant. But I strongly believe our leadership and\r\nour security cannot depend on our outstanding military alone. As\r\nCommander in Chief, I have used force when needed to protect the\r\nAmerican people, and I will never hesitate to do so as long as I hold\r\nthis office. But I will not send our troops into harm's way unless it\r\nis truly necessary, nor will I allow our sons and daughters to be mired\r\nin open-ended conflicts. We must fight the battles that need to be\r\nfought, not those that terrorists prefer from us: large-scale\r\ndeployments that drain our strength and may ultimately feed extremism.\r\n\r\nSo even as we actively and aggressively pursue terrorist networks\r\nthrough more targeted efforts and by building the capacity of our\r\nforeign partners, America must move off a permanent war footing. That's\r\nwhy I've imposed prudent limits on the use of drones. For we will not\r\nbe safer if people abroad believe we strike within their countries\r\nwithout regard for the consequence.\r\n\r\nThat's why, working with this Congress, I will reform our surveillance\r\nprograms, because the vital work of our intelligence community depends\r\non public confidence, here and abroad, that privacy of ordinary people\r\nis not being violated.\r\n\r\nAnd with the Afghan war ending, this needs to be the year Congress\r\nlifts the remaining restrictions on detainee transfers and we close the\r\nprison at Guantanamo Bay. Because we counter terrorism not just through\r\nintelligence and military actions, but by remaining true to our\r\nconstitutional ideals and setting an example for the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nYou see, in a world of complex threats, our security, our leadership,\r\ndepends on all elements of our power, including strong and principled\r\ndiplomacy. American diplomacy has rallied more than 50 countries to\r\nprevent nuclear materials from falling into the wrong hands and allowed\r\nus to reduce our own reliance on cold war stockpiles. American\r\ndiplomacy, backed by the threat of force, is why Syria's chemical\r\nweapons are being eliminated.\r\n\r\nAnd we will continue to work with the international community to usher\r\nin the future the Syrian people deserve, a future free of dictatorship,\r\nterror, and fear. As we speak, American diplomacy is supporting\r\nIsraelis and Palestinians as they engage in the difficult but necessary\r\ntalks to end the conflict there, to achieve dignity and an independent\r\nstate for Palestinians and lasting peace and security for the State of\r\nIsrael, a Jewish state that knows America will always be at their side.\r\n\r\nAnd it is American diplomacy, backed by pressure, that has halted the\r\nprogress of Iran's nuclear program and rolled back parts of that\r\nprogram for the very first time in a decade. As we gather here tonight,\r\nIran has begun to eliminate its stockpile of higher levels of enriched\r\nuranium. It's not installing advanced centrifuges. Unprecedented\r\ninspections help the world verify every day that Iran is not building a\r\nbomb. And with our allies and partners, we're engaged in negotiations\r\nto see if we can peacefully achieve a goal we all share: preventing\r\nIran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\r\n\r\nThese negotiations will be difficult. They may not succeed. We are\r\nclear eyed about Iran's support for terrorist organizations like\r\nHizballah, which threatens our allies. And we're clear about the\r\nmistrust between our nations, mistrust that cannot be wished away. But\r\nthese negotiations don't rely on trust. Any long-term deal we agree to\r\nmust be based on verifiable action that convinces us and the\r\ninternational community that Iran is not building a nuclear bomb. If\r\nJohn F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan could negotiate with the Soviet Union,\r\nthen surely a strong and confident America can negotiate with less\r\npowerful adversaries today.\r\n\r\nThe sanctions that we put in place helped make this opportunity\r\npossible. But let me be clear: If this Congress sends me a new\r\nsanctions bill now that threatens to derail these talks, I will veto it.\r\nFor the sake of our national security, we must give diplomacy a chance\r\nto succeed. If Iran's leaders do not seize this opportunity, then I\r\nwill be the first to call for more sanctions and stand ready to\r\nexercise all options to make sure Iran does not build a nuclear weapon.\r\nBut if Iran's leaders do seize the chance--and we'll know soon enough--\r\nthen Iran could take an important step to rejoin the community of\r\nnations, and we will have resolved one of the leading security\r\nchallenges of our time without the risks of war.\r\n\r\nNow, finally, let's remember that our leadership is defined not just by\r\nour defense against threats, but by the enormous opportunities to do\r\ngood and promote understanding around the globe: to forge greater\r\ncooperation, to expand new markets, to free people from fear and want.\r\nAnd no one is better positioned to take advantage of those\r\nopportunities than America.\r\n\r\nOur alliance with Europe remains the strongest the world has ever known.\r\nFrom Tunisia to Burma, we're supporting those who are willing to do the\r\nhard work of building democracy. In Ukraine, we stand for the principle\r\nthat all people have the right to express themselves freely and\r\npeacefully and to have a say in their country's future. Across Africa,\r\nwe're bringing together businesses and governments to double access to\r\nelectricity and help end extreme poverty. In the Americas, we're\r\nbuilding new ties of commerce, but we're also expanding cultural and\r\neducational exchanges among young people. And we will continue to focus\r\non the Asia-Pacific, where we support our allies, shape a future of\r\ngreater security and prosperity, and extend a hand to those devastated\r\nby disaster, as we did in the Philippines, when our Marines and\r\ncivilians rushed to aid those battered by a typhoon, and who were\r\ngreeted with words like, \"We will never forget your kindness\" and \"God\r\nbless America.\"\r\n\r\nWe do these things because they help promote our long-term security,\r\nand we do them because we believe in the inherent dignity and equality\r\nof every human being, regardless of race or religion, creed or sexual\r\norientation. And next week, the world will see one expression of that\r\ncommitment, when Team U.S.A. marches the red, white, and blue into the\r\nOlympic Stadium and brings home the gold. [Laughter]\r\n\r\nAudience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\r\n\r\nThe President. My fellow Americans, no other country in the world does\r\nwhat we do. On every issue, the world turns to us, not simply because\r\nof the size of our economy or our military might, but because of the\r\nideals we stand for and the burdens we bear to advance them. No one\r\nknows this better than those who serve in uniform.\r\n\r\nAs this time of war draws to a close, a new generation of heroes\r\nreturns to civilian life. We'll keep slashing that backlog so our\r\nveterans receive the benefits they've earned and our wounded warriors\r\nreceive the health care--including the mental health care--that they need.\r\nWe'll keep working to help all our veterans translate their skills and\r\nleadership into jobs here at home. And we will all continue to join\r\nforces to honor and support our remarkable military families.\r\n\r\nLet me tell you about one of those families I've come to know. I first\r\nmet Cory Remsburg, a proud Army Ranger, at Omaha Beach on the 65th\r\nanniversary of D-day. Along with some of his fellow Rangers, he walked\r\nme through the program and the ceremony. He was a strong, impressive\r\nyoung man, had an easy manner, he was sharp as a tack. And we joked\r\naround and took pictures, and I told him to stay in touch.\r\n\r\nA few months later, on his 10th deployment, Cory was nearly killed by a\r\nmassive roadside bomb in Afghanistan. His comrades found him in a canal,\r\nface down, underwater, shrapnel in his brain. For months, he lay in a\r\ncoma. And the next time I met him, in the hospital, he couldn't speak,\r\ncould barely move. Over the years, he's endured dozens of surgeries and\r\nprocedures, hours of grueling rehab every day.\r\n\r\nEven now, Cory is still blind in one eye, still struggles on his left\r\nside. But slowly, steadily, with the support of caregivers like his dad\r\nCraig and the community around him, Cory has grown stronger. And day by\r\nday, he's learned to speak again and stand again and walk again. And\r\nhe's working toward the day when he can serve his country again. \"My\r\nrecovery has not been easy,\" he says. \"Nothing in life that's worth\r\nanything is easy.\" Cory is here tonight. And like the Army he loves,\r\nlike the America he serves, Sergeant First Class Cory Remsburg never\r\ngives up, and he does not quit. Cory.\r\n\r\nMy fellow Americans, men and women like Cory remind us that America has\r\nnever come easy. Our freedom, our democracy, has never been easy.\r\nSometimes, we stumble, we make mistakes; we get frustrated or\r\ndiscouraged. But for more than 200 years, we have put those things\r\naside and placed our collective shoulder to the wheel of progress: to\r\ncreate and build and expand the possibilities of individual achievement,\r\nto free other nations from tyranny and fear, to promote justice and\r\nfairness and equality under the law so that the words set to paper by\r\nour Founders are made real for every citizen. The America we want for\r\nour kids--a rising America where honest work is plentiful and\r\ncommunities are strong, where prosperity is widely shared and\r\nopportunity for all lets us go as far as our dreams and toil will take\r\nus--none of it is easy. But if we work together--if we summon what is\r\nbest in us, the way Cory summoned what is best in him--with our feet\r\nplanted firmly in today, but our eyes cast toward tomorrow, I know it\r\nis within our reach. Believe it.\r\n\r\nGod bless you, and God bless the United States of America.\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\nAddress Before a Joint Session of the Congress on the State of the Union\r\nBarack Obama\r\nJanuary 20, 2015\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, my\r\nfellow Americans: We are 15 years into this new century. Fifteen years\r\nthat dawned with terror touching our shores, that unfolded with a new\r\ngeneration fighting two long and costly wars, that saw a vicious\r\nrecession spread across our Nation and the world. It has been and still\r\nis a hard time for many.\r\n\r\nBut tonight we turn the page. Tonight, after a breakthrough year for\r\nAmerica, our economy is growing and creating jobs at the fastest pace\r\nsince 1999. Our unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the\r\nfinancial crisis. More of our kids are graduating than ever before.\r\nMore of our people are insured than ever before. And we are as free\r\nfrom the grip of foreign oil as we've been in almost 30 years.\r\n\r\nTonight, for the first time since 9/11, our combat mission in\r\nAfghanistan is over. Six years ago, nearly 180,000 American troops\r\nserved in Iraq and Afghanistan. Today, fewer than 15,000 remain. And we\r\nsalute the courage and sacrifice of every man and woman in this 9/11\r\ngeneration who has served to keep us safe. We are humbled and grateful\r\nfor your service.\r\n\r\nAmerica, for all that we have endured, for all the grit and hard work\r\nrequired to come back, for all the tasks that lie ahead, know this: The\r\nshadow of crisis has passed, and the State of the Union is strong.\r\n\r\nAt this moment--with a growing economy, shrinking deficits, bustling\r\nindustry, booming energy production--we have risen from recession freer\r\nto write our own future than any other nation on Earth. It's now up to\r\nus to choose who we want to be over the next 15 years and for decades\r\nto come.\r\n\r\nWill we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well?\r\nOr will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes\r\nand chances for everyone who makes the effort?\r\n\r\nWill we approach the world fearful and reactive, dragged into costly\r\nconflicts that strain our military and set back our standing? Or will\r\nwe lead wisely, using all elements of our power to defeat new threats\r\nand protect our planet?\r\n\r\nWill we allow ourselves to be sorted into factions and turned against\r\none another? Or will we recapture the sense of common purpose that has\r\nalways propelled America forward?\r\n\r\nIn 2 weeks, I will send this Congress a budget filled with ideas that\r\nare practical, not partisan. And in the months ahead, I'll crisscross\r\nthe country making a case for those ideas. So tonight I want to focus\r\nless on a checklist of proposals and focus more on the values at stake\r\nin the choices before us.\r\n\r\nIt begins with our economy. Seven years ago, Rebekah and Ben Erler of\r\nMinneapolis were newlyweds. [Laughter] She waited tables. He worked\r\nconstruction. Their first child Jack was on the way. They were young\r\nand in love in America. And it doesn't get much better than that. \"If\r\nonly we had known,\" Rebekah wrote to me last spring, \"what was about to\r\nhappen to the housing and construction market.\" As the crisis worsened,\r\nBen's business dried up, so he took what jobs he could find, even if\r\nthey kept him on the road for long stretches of time. Rebekah took out\r\nstudent loans and enrolled in community college and retrained for a new\r\ncareer. They sacrificed for each other. And slowly, it paid off. They\r\nbought their first home. They had a second son Henry. Rebekah got a\r\nbetter job and then a raise. Ben is back in construction and home for\r\ndinner every night.\r\n\r\n\"It is amazing,\" Rebekah wrote, \"what you can bounce back from when you\r\nhave to. . . . We are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it\r\nthrough some very, very hard times.\" We are a strong, tight-knit family\r\nwho has made it through some very, very hard times.\r\n\r\nAmerica, Rebekah and Ben's story is our story. They represent the\r\nmillions who have worked hard and scrimped and sacrificed and retooled.\r\nYou are the reason that I ran for this office. You are the people I was\r\nthinking of 6 years ago today, in the darkest months of the crisis,\r\nwhen I stood on the steps of this Capitol and promised we would rebuild\r\nour economy on a new foundation. And it has been your resilience, your\r\neffort that has made it possible for our country to emerge stronger.\r\n\r\nWe believed we could reverse the tide of outsourcing and draw new jobs\r\nto our shores. And over the past 5 years, our businesses have created\r\nmore than 11 million new jobs.\r\n\r\nWe believed we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil and protect\r\nour planet. And today, America is number one in oil and gas. America is\r\nnumber one in wind power. Every 3 weeks, we bring online as much solar\r\npower as we did in all of 2008. And thanks to lower gas prices and\r\nhigher fuel standards, the typical family this year should save about\r\n$750 at the pump.\r\n\r\nWe believed we could prepare our kids for a more competitive world. And\r\ntoday, our younger students have earned the highest math and reading\r\nscores on record. Our high school graduation rate has hit an alltime\r\nhigh. More Americans finish college than ever before.\r\n\r\nWe believed that sensible regulations could prevent another crisis,\r\nshield families from ruin, and encourage fair competition. Today, we\r\nhave new tools to stop taxpayer-funded bailouts and a new consumer\r\nwatchdog to protect us from predatory lending and abusive credit card\r\npractices. And in the past year alone, about 10 million uninsured\r\nAmericans finally gained the security of health coverage.\r\n\r\nAt every step, we were told our goals were misguided or too ambitious,\r\nthat we would crush jobs and explode deficits. Instead, we've seen the\r\nfastest economic growth in over a decade, our deficits cut by two-\r\nthirds, a stock market that has doubled, and health care inflation at\r\nits lowest rate in 50 years. This is good news, people. [Laughter]\r\n\r\nSo the verdict is clear. Middle class economics works. Expanding\r\nopportunity works. And these policies will continue to work as long as\r\npolitics don't get in the way. We can't slow down businesses or put our\r\neconomy at risk with Government shutdowns or fiscal showdowns. We can't\r\nput the security of families at risk by taking away their health\r\ninsurance or unraveling the new rules on Wall Street or refighting past\r\nbattles on immigration when we've got to fix a broken system. And if a\r\nbill comes to my desk that tries to do any of these things, I will veto\r\nit. It will have earned my veto.\r\n\r\nToday, thanks to a growing economy, the recovery is touching more and\r\nmore lives. Wages are finally starting to rise again. We know that more\r\nsmall-business owners plan to raise their employees' pay than at any\r\ntime since 2007. But here's the thing: Those of us here tonight, we\r\nneed to set our sights higher than just making sure Government doesn't\r\nscrew things up--[laughter]--that Government doesn't halt the progress\r\nwe're making. We need to do more than just do no harm. Tonight,\r\ntogether, let's do more to restore the link between hard work and\r\ngrowing opportunity for every American.\r\n\r\nBecause families like Rebekah's still need our help. She and Ben are\r\nworking as hard as ever, but they've had to forego vacations and a new\r\ncar so that they can pay off student loans and save for retirement.\r\nFriday night pizza, that's a big splurge. Basic childcare for Jack and\r\nHenry costs more than their mortgage and almost as much as a year at\r\nthe University of Minnesota. Like millions of hard-working Americans,\r\nRebekah isn't asking for a handout, but she is asking that we look for\r\nmore ways to help families get ahead.\r\n\r\nAnd in fact, at every moment of economic change throughout our history,\r\nthis country has taken bold action to adapt to new circumstances and to\r\nmake sure everyone gets a fair shot. We set up worker protections,\r\nSocial Security, Medicare, Medicaid to protect ourselves from the\r\nharshest adversity. We gave our citizens schools and colleges,\r\ninfrastructure and the Internet, tools they needed to go as far as\r\ntheir efforts and their dreams will take them.\r\n\r\nThat's what middle class economics is: the idea that this country does\r\nbest when everyone gets their fair shot, everyone does their fair share,\r\neveryone plays by the same set of rules. We don't just want everyone to\r\nshare in America's success, we want everyone to contribute to our\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nSo what does middle class economics require in our time? First, middle\r\nclass economics means helping working families feel more secure in a\r\nworld of constant change. That means helping folks afford childcare,\r\ncollege, health care, a home, retirement. And my budget will address\r\neach of these issues, lowering the taxes of working families and\r\nputting thousands of dollars back into their pockets each year.\r\n\r\nHere's one example. During World War II, when men like my grandfather\r\nwent off to war, having women like my grandmother in the workforce was\r\na national security priority, so this country provided universal\r\nchildcare. In today's economy, when having both parents in the\r\nworkforce is an economic necessity for many families, we need\r\naffordable, high-quality childcare more than ever.\r\n\r\nIt's not a nice-to-have, it's a must-have. So it's time we stop\r\ntreating childcare as a side issue, or as a women's issue, and treat it\r\nlike the national economic priority that it is for all of us. And\r\nthat's why my plan will make quality childcare more available and more\r\naffordable for every middle class and low-income family with young\r\nchildren in America, by creating more slots and a new tax cut of up to\r\n$3,000 per child, per year.\r\n\r\nHere's another example. Today, we are the only advanced country on\r\nEarth that doesn't guarantee paid sick leave or paid maternity leave to\r\nour workers. Forty-three million workers have no paid sick leave--43\r\nmillion. Think about that. And that forces too many parents to make the\r\ngut-wrenching choice between a paycheck and a sick kid at home. So I'll\r\nbe taking new action to help States adopt paid leave laws of their own.\r\nAnd since paid sick leave won where it was on the ballot last November,\r\nlet's put it to a vote right here in Washington. Send me a bill that\r\ngives every worker in America the opportunity to earn 7 days of paid\r\nsick leave. It's the right thing to do. [Applause] It's the right thing\r\nto do.\r\n\r\nOf course, nothing helps families make ends meet like higher wages.\r\nThat's why this Congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a\r\nwoman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work. I mean, it's\r\n2015. [Laughter] It's time. We still need to make sure employees get\r\nthe overtime they've earned. And to everyone in this Congress who still\r\nrefuses to raise the minimum wage, I say this: If you truly believe you\r\ncould work full time and support a family on less than $15,000 a year,\r\ntry it. If not, vote to give millions of the hardest working people in\r\nAmerica a raise.\r\n\r\nNow, these ideas won't make everybody rich, won't relieve every\r\nhardship. That's not the job of government. To give working families a\r\nfair shot, we still need more employers to see beyond next quarter's\r\nearnings and recognize that investing in their workforce is in their\r\ncompany's long-term interest. We still need laws that strengthen rather\r\nthan weaken unions, and give American workers a voice.\r\n\r\nBut you know, things like childcare and sick leave and equal pay,\r\nthings like lower mortgage premiums and a higher minimum wage--these\r\nideas will make a meaningful difference in the lives of millions of\r\nfamilies. That's a fact. And that's what all of us, Republicans and\r\nDemocrats alike, were sent here to do.\r\n\r\nNow, second, to make sure folks keep earning higher wages down the road,\r\nwe have to do more to help Americans upgrade their skills. America\r\nthrived in the 20th century because we made high school free, sent a\r\ngeneration of GIs to college, trained the best workforce in the world.\r\nWe were ahead of the curve. But other countries caught on. And in a\r\n21st-century economy that rewards knowledge like never before, we need\r\nto up our game. We need to do more.\r\n\r\nBy the end of this decade, two in three job openings will require some\r\nhigher education--two in three. And yet we still live in a country where\r\ntoo many bright, striving Americans are priced out of the education\r\nthey need. It's not fair to them, and it's sure not smart for our\r\nfuture. And that's why I'm sending this Congress a bold new plan to\r\nlower the cost of community college to zero.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind, 40 percent of our college students choose community\r\ncollege. Some are young and starting out. Some are older and looking\r\nfor a better job. Some are veterans and single parents trying to\r\ntransition back into the job market. Whoever you are, this plan is your\r\nchance to graduate ready for the new economy without a load of debt.\r\nUnderstand, you've got to earn it. You've got to keep your grades up\r\nand graduate on time.\r\n\r\nTennessee, a State with Republican leadership, and Chicago, a city with\r\nDemocratic leadership, are showing that free community college is\r\npossible. I want to spread that idea all across America so that 2 years\r\nof college becomes as free and universal in America as high school is\r\ntoday. Let's stay ahead of the curve. And I want to work with this\r\nCongress to make sure those already burdened with student loans can\r\nreduce their monthly payments so that student debt doesn't derail\r\nanyone's dreams.\r\n\r\nThanks to Vice President Biden's great work to update our job training\r\nsystem, we're connecting community colleges with local employers to\r\ntrain workers to fill high-paying jobs like coding and nursing and\r\nrobotics. Tonight I'm also asking more businesses to follow the lead of\r\ncompanies like CVS and UPS and offer more educational benefits and paid\r\napprenticeships, opportunities that give workers the chance to earn\r\nhigher paying jobs even if they don't have a higher education.\r\n\r\nAnd as a new generation of veterans comes home, we owe them every\r\nopportunity to live the American Dream they helped defend. Already,\r\nwe've made strides towards ensuring that every veteran has access to\r\nthe highest quality care. We're slashing the backlog that had too many\r\nveterans waiting years to get the benefits they need. And we're making\r\nit easier for vets to translate their training and experience into\r\ncivilian jobs. And Joining Forces, the national campaign launched by\r\nMichelle and Jill Biden--[applause]--thank you, Michelle; thank you,\r\nJill--has helped nearly 700,000 veterans and military spouses get a new\r\njob. So to every CEO in America, let me repeat: If you want somebody\r\nwho's going to get the job done and done right, hire a veteran.\r\n\r\nFinally, as we better train our workers, we need the new economy to\r\nkeep churning out high-wage jobs for our workers to fill. Since 2010,\r\nAmerica has put more people back to work than Europe, Japan, and all\r\nadvanced economies combined.\r\n\r\nOur manufacturers have added almost 800,000 new jobs. Some of our\r\nbedrock sectors, like our auto industry, are booming. But there are\r\nalso millions of Americans who work in jobs that didn't even exist 10\r\nor 20 years ago, jobs at companies like Google and eBay and Tesla.\r\n\r\nSo no one knows for certain which industries will generate the jobs of\r\nthe future. But we do know we want them here in America. We know that.\r\nAnd that's why the third part of middle class economics is all about\r\nbuilding the most competitive economy anywhere, the place where\r\nbusinesses want to locate and hire.\r\n\r\nTwenty-first century businesses need 21st-century infrastructure:\r\nmodern ports and stronger bridges, faster trains and the fastest\r\nInternet. Democrats and Republicans used to agree on this. So let's set\r\nour sights higher than a single oil pipeline. Let's pass a bipartisan\r\ninfrastructure plan that could create more than 30 times as many jobs\r\nper year and make this country stronger for decades to come. Let's do\r\nit. Let's get it done. [Applause] Let's get it done.\r\n\r\nTwenty-first century businesses, including small businesses, need to\r\nsell more American products overseas. Today, our businesses export more\r\nthan ever, and exporters tend to pay their workers higher wages. But as\r\nwe speak, China wants to write the rules for the world's fastest\r\ngrowing region. That would put our workers and our businesses at a\r\ndisadvantage. Why would we let that happen? We should write those rules.\r\nWe should level the playing field. And that's why I'm asking both\r\nparties to give me trade promotion authority to protect American\r\nworkers, with strong new trade deals from Asia to Europe that aren't\r\njust free, but are also fair. It's the right thing to do.\r\n\r\nLook, I'm the first one to admit that past trade deals haven't always\r\nlived up to the hype, and that's why we've gone after countries that\r\nbreak the rules at our expense. But 95 percent of the world's customers\r\nlive outside our borders. We can't close ourselves off from those\r\nopportunities. More than half of manufacturing executives have said\r\nthey're actively looking to bring jobs back from China. So let's give\r\nthem one more reason to get it done.\r\n\r\nTwenty-first century businesses will rely on American science and\r\ntechnology, research and development. I want the country that\r\neliminated polio and mapped the human genome to lead a new era of\r\nmedicine, one that delivers the right treatment at the right time.\r\n\r\nIn some patients with cystic fibrosis, this approach has reversed a\r\ndisease once thought unstoppable. So tonight I'm launching a new\r\nprecision medicine initiative to bring us closer to curing diseases\r\nlike cancer and diabetes and to give all of us access to the\r\npersonalized information we need to keep ourselves and our families\r\nhealthier. We can do this.\r\n\r\nI intend to protect a free and open Internet, extend its reach to every\r\nclassroom and every community and help folks build the fastest networks\r\nso that the next generation of digital innovators and entrepreneurs\r\nhave the platform to keep reshaping our world. I want Americans to win\r\nthe race for the kinds of discoveries that unleash new jobs: converting\r\nsunlight into liquid fuel; creating revolutionary prosthetics so that a\r\nveteran who gave his arms for his country can play catch with his kids\r\nagain; pushing out into the solar system not just to visit, but to stay.\r\nLast month, we launched a new spacecraft as part of a reenergized space\r\nprogram that will send American astronauts to Mars. And in 2 months, to\r\nprepare us for those missions, Scott Kelly will begin a year-long stay\r\nin space. So good luck, Captain. Make sure to Instagram it. We're proud\r\nof you.\r\n\r\nNow, the truth is, when it comes to issues like infrastructure and\r\nbasic research, I know there's bipartisan support in this Chamber.\r\nMembers of both parties have told me so. Where we too often run onto\r\nthe rocks is how to pay for these investments. As Americans, we don't\r\nmind paying our fair share of taxes as long as everybody else does too.\r\nBut for far too long, lobbyists have rigged the Tax Code with loopholes\r\nthat let some corporations pay nothing while others pay full freight.\r\nThey've riddled it with giveaways that the super-rich don't need, while\r\ndenying a break to middle class families who do.\r\n\r\nThis year, we have an opportunity to change that. Let's close loopholes\r\nso we stop rewarding companies that keep profits abroad and reward\r\nthose that invest here in America. Let's use those savings to rebuild\r\nour infrastructure and to make it more attractive for companies to\r\nbring jobs home. Let's simplify the system and let a small-business\r\nowner file based on her actual bank statement, instead of the number of\r\naccountants she can afford. And let's close the loopholes that lead to\r\ninequality by allowing the top 1 percent to avoid paying taxes on their\r\naccumulated wealth. We can use that money to help more families pay for\r\nchildcare and send their kids to college. We need a Tax Code that truly\r\nhelps working Americans trying to get a leg up in the new economy, and\r\nwe can achieve that together. [Applause] We can achieve it together.\r\n\r\nHelping hard-working families make ends meet, giving them the tools\r\nthey need for good-paying jobs in this new economy, maintaining the\r\nconditions of growth and competitiveness--this is where America needs to\r\ngo. I believe it's where the American people want to go. It will make\r\nour economy stronger a year from now, 15 years from now, and deep into\r\nthe century ahead.\r\n\r\nOf course, if there's one thing this new century has taught us, it's\r\nthat we cannot separate our work here at home from challenges beyond\r\nour shores. My first duty as Commander in Chief is to defend the United\r\nStates of America. In doing so, the question is not whether America\r\nleads in the world, but how. When we make rash decisions, reacting to\r\nthe headlines instead of using our heads, when the first response to a\r\nchallenge is to send in our military, then we risk getting drawn into\r\nunnecessary conflicts and neglect the broader strategy we need for a\r\nsafer, more prosperous world. That's what our enemies want us to do.\r\n\r\nI believe in a smarter kind of American leadership. We lead best when\r\nwe combine military power with strong diplomacy, when we leverage our\r\npower with coalition building, when we don't let our fears blind us to\r\nthe opportunities that this new century presents. That's exactly what\r\nwe're doing right now. And around the globe, it is making a difference.\r\n\r\nFirst, we stand united with people around the world who have been\r\ntargeted by terrorists, from a school in Pakistan to the streets of\r\nParis. We will continue to hunt down terrorists and dismantle their\r\nnetworks, and we reserve the right to act unilaterally, as we have done\r\nrelentlessly since I took office, to take out terrorists who pose a\r\ndirect threat to us and our allies. At the same time, we've learned\r\nsome costly lessons over the last 13 years. Instead of Americans\r\npatrolling the valleys of Afghanistan, we've trained their security\r\nforces, who have now taken the lead, and we've honored our troops'\r\nsacrifice by supporting that country's first democratic transition.\r\nInstead of sending large ground forces overseas, we're partnering with\r\nnations from South Asia to North Africa to deny safe haven to\r\nterrorists who threaten America.\r\n\r\nIn Iraq and Syria, American leadership--including our military power--is\r\nstopping ISIL's advance. Instead of getting dragged into another ground\r\nwar in the Middle East, we are leading a broad coalition, including\r\nArab nations, to degrade and ultimately destroy this terrorist group.\r\nWe're also supporting a moderate opposition in Syria that can help us\r\nin this effort and assisting people everywhere who stand up to the\r\nbankrupt ideology of violent extremism.\r\n\r\nNow, this effort will take time. It will require focus. But we will\r\nsucceed. And tonight I call on this Congress to show the world that we\r\nare united in this mission by passing a resolution to authorize the use\r\nof force against ISIL. We need that authority.\r\n\r\nSecond, we're demonstrating the power of American strength and\r\ndiplomacy. We're upholding the principle that bigger nations can't\r\nbully the small, by opposing Russian aggression and supporting\r\nUkraine's democracy and reassuring our NATO allies.\r\n\r\nLast year, as we were doing the hard work of imposing sanctions along\r\nwith our allies, as we were reinforcing our presence with frontline\r\nstates, Mr. Putin's aggression, it was suggested, was a masterful\r\ndisplay of strategy and strength. That's what I heard from some folks.\r\n[Laughter] Well, today, it is America that stands strong and united\r\nwith our allies, while Russia is isolated with its economy in tatters.\r\nThat's how America leads: not with bluster, but with persistent, steady\r\nresolve.\r\n\r\nIn Cuba, we are ending a policy that was long past its expiration date.\r\nWhen what you're doing doesn't work for 50 years, it's time to try\r\nsomething new. [Laughter] And our shift in Cuba policy has the\r\npotential to end a legacy of mistrust in our hemisphere. It removes a\r\nphony excuse for restrictions in Cuba. It stands up for democratic\r\nvalues and extends the hand of friendship to the Cuban people. And this\r\nyear, Congress should begin the work of ending the embargo.\r\n\r\nAs His Holiness Pope Francis has said, diplomacy is the work of \"small\r\nsteps.\" And these small steps have added up to new hope for the future\r\nin Cuba. And after years in prison, we are overjoyed that Alan Gross is\r\nback where he belongs. Welcome home, Alan. We're glad you're here.\r\n\r\nOur diplomacy is at work with respect to Iran, where, for the first\r\ntime in a decade, we've halted the progress of its nuclear program and\r\nreduced its stockpile of nuclear material. Between now and this spring,\r\nwe have a chance to negotiate a comprehensive agreement that prevents a\r\nnuclear-armed Iran, secures America and our allies, including Israel,\r\nwhile avoiding yet another Middle East conflict. There are no\r\nguarantees that negotiations will succeed, and I keep all options on\r\nthe table to prevent a nuclear Iran.\r\n\r\nBut new sanctions passed by this Congress, at this moment in time, will\r\nall but guarantee that diplomacy fails: alienating America from its\r\nallies, making it harder to maintain sanctions, and ensuring that Iran\r\nstarts up its nuclear program again. It doesn't make sense. And that's\r\nwhy I will veto any new sanctions bill that threatens to undo this\r\nprogress. The American people expect us only to go to war as a last\r\nresort, and I intend to stay true to that wisdom. Third, we're looking\r\nbeyond the issues that have consumed us in the past to shape the coming\r\ncentury. No foreign nation, no hacker, should be able to shut down our\r\nnetworks, steal our trade secrets, or invade the privacy of American\r\nfamilies, especially our kids. So we're making sure our Government\r\nintegrates intelligence to combat cyber threats, just as we have done\r\nto combat terrorism.\r\n\r\nAnd tonight I urge this Congress to finally pass the legislation we\r\nneed to better meet the evolving threat of cyber attacks, combat\r\nidentity theft, and protect our children's information. That should be\r\na bipartisan effort. If we don't act, we'll leave our Nation and our\r\neconomy vulnerable. If we do, we can continue to protect the\r\ntechnologies that have unleashed untold opportunities for people around\r\nthe globe.\r\n\r\nIn West Africa, our troops, our scientists, our doctors, our nurses,\r\nour health care workers are rolling back Ebola, saving countless lives\r\nand stopping the spread of disease. I could not be prouder of them, and\r\nI thank this Congress for your bipartisan support of their efforts. But\r\nthe job is not yet done, and the world needs to use this lesson to\r\nbuild a more effective global effort to prevent the spread of future\r\npandemics, invest in smart development, and eradicate extreme poverty.\r\n\r\nIn the Asia-Pacific, we are modernizing alliances while making sure\r\nthat other nations play by the rules: in how they trade, how they\r\nresolve maritime disputes, how they participate in meeting common\r\ninternational challenges like nonproliferation and disaster relief. And\r\nno challenge--no challenge--poses a greater threat to future generations\r\nthan climate change.\r\n\r\nTwo thousand fourteen was the planet's warmest year on record. Now, 1\r\nyear doesn't make a trend, but this does: 14 of the 15 warmest years on\r\nrecord have all fallen in the first 15 years of this century.\r\n\r\nNow, I've heard some folks try to dodge the evidence by saying they're\r\nnot scientists, that we don't have enough information to act. Well, I'm\r\nnot a scientist, either. But you know what, I know a lot of really good\r\nscientists--[laughter]--at NASA and at NOAA and at our major universities.\r\nAnd the best scientists in the world are all telling us that our\r\nactivities are changing the climate, and if we don't act forcefully,\r\nwe'll continue to see rising oceans, longer, hotter heat waves,\r\ndangerous droughts and floods, and massive disruptions that can trigger\r\ngreater migration and conflict and hunger around the globe. The\r\nPentagon says that climate change poses immediate risks to our national\r\nsecurity. We should act like it.\r\n\r\nAnd that's why, over the past 6 years, we've done more than ever to\r\ncombat climate change, from the way we produce energy to the way we use\r\nit. That's why we've set aside more public lands and waters than any\r\nadministration in history. And that's why I will not let this Congress\r\nendanger the health of our children by turning back the clock on our\r\nefforts. I am determined to make sure that American leadership drives\r\ninternational action.\r\n\r\nIn Beijing, we made a historic announcement: The United States will\r\ndouble the pace at which we cut carbon pollution. And China committed,\r\nfor the first time, to limiting their emissions. And because the\r\nworld's two largest economies came together, other nations are now\r\nstepping up and offering hope that this year the world will finally\r\nreach an agreement to protect the one planet we've got.\r\n\r\nAnd there's one last pillar of our leadership, and that's the example\r\nof our values. As Americans, we respect human dignity, even when we're\r\nthreatened, which is why I have prohibited torture and worked to make\r\nsure our use of new technology like drones is properly constrained.\r\nIt's why we speak out against the deplorable anti-Semitism that has\r\nresurfaced in certain parts of the world. It's why we continue to\r\nreject offensive stereotypes of Muslims, the vast majority of whom\r\nshare our commitment to peace. That's why we defend free speech and\r\nadvocate for political prisoners and condemn the persecution of women\r\nor religious minorities or people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or\r\ntransgender. We do these things not only because they are the right\r\nthing to do, but because ultimately, they will make us safer.\r\n\r\nAs Americans, we have a profound commitment to justice. So it makes no\r\nsense to spend $3 million per prisoner to keep open a prison that the\r\nworld condemns and terrorists use to recruit. Since I've been President,\r\nwe've worked responsibly to cut the population of Gitmo in half. Now it\r\nis time to finish the job. And I will not relent in my determination to\r\nshut it down. It is not who we are. It's time to close Gitmo.\r\n\r\nAs Americans, we cherish our civil liberties, and we need to uphold\r\nthat commitment if we want maximum cooperation from other countries and\r\nindustry in our fight against terrorist networks. So while some have\r\nmoved on from the debates over our surveillance programs, I have not.\r\nAs promised, our intelligence agencies have worked hard, with the\r\nrecommendations of privacy advocates, to increase transparency and\r\nbuild more safeguards against potential abuse. And next month, we'll\r\nissue a report on how we're keeping our promise to keep our country\r\nsafe while strengthening privacy.\r\n\r\nLooking to the future instead of the past, making sure we match our\r\npower with diplomacy and use force wisely, building coalitions to meet\r\nnew challenges and opportunities, leading always with the example of\r\nour values--that's what makes us exceptional. That's what keeps us\r\nstrong. That's why we have to keep striving to hold ourselves to the\r\nhighest of standards: our own.\r\n\r\nYou know, just over a decade ago, I gave a speech in Boston where I\r\nsaid there wasn't a liberal America or a conservative America, a Black\r\nAmerica or a White America, but a United States of America. I said this\r\nbecause I had seen it in my own life, in a nation that gave someone\r\nlike me a chance; because I grew up in Hawaii, a melting pot of races\r\nand customs; because I made Illinois my home, a State of small towns,\r\nrich farmland, one of the world's great cities, a microcosm of the\r\ncountry where Democrats and Republicans and Independents, good people\r\nof every ethnicity and every faith, share certain bedrock values.\r\n\r\nOver the past 6 years, the pundits have pointed out more than once that\r\nmy Presidency hasn't delivered on this vision. How ironic, they say,\r\nthat our politics seems more divided than ever. It's held up as proof\r\nnot just of my own flaws--of which there are many--but also as proof that\r\nthe vision itself is misguided, naive, that there are too many people\r\nin this town who actually benefit from partisanship and gridlock for us\r\nto ever do anything about it.\r\n\r\nI know how tempting such cynicism may be. But I still think the cynics\r\nare wrong. I still believe that we are one people. I still believe that\r\ntogether, we can do great things, even when the odds are long.\r\n\r\nI believe this because over and over in my 6 years in office, I have\r\nseen America at its best. I've seen the hopeful faces of young\r\ngraduates from New York to California and our newest officers at West\r\nPoint, Annapolis, Colorado Springs, New London. I've mourned with\r\ngrieving families in Tucson and Newtown, in Boston, in West, Texas, and\r\nWest Virginia. I've watched Americans beat back adversity from the Gulf\r\nCoast to the Great Plains, from Midwest assembly lines to the Mid-\r\nAtlantic seaboard. I've seen something like gay marriage go from a\r\nwedge issue used to drive us apart to a story of freedom across our\r\ncountry, a civil right now legal in States that 7 in 10 Americans call\r\nhome. So I know the good and optimistic and big-hearted generosity of\r\nthe American people who every day live the idea that we are our\r\nbrother's keeper and our sister's keeper. And I know they expect those\r\nof us who serve here to set a better example.\r\n\r\nSo the question for those of us here tonight is how we, all of us, can\r\nbetter reflect America's hopes. I've served in Congress with many of\r\nyou. I know many of you well. There are a lot of good people here on\r\nboth sides of the aisle. And many of you have told me that this isn't\r\nwhat you signed up for: arguing past each other on cable shows, the\r\nconstant fundraising, always looking over your shoulder at how the base\r\nwill react to every decision.\r\n\r\nImagine if we broke out of these tired old patterns. Imagine if we did\r\nsomething different. Understand, a better politics isn't one where\r\nDemocrats abandon their agenda or Republicans simply embrace mine. A\r\nbetter politics is one where we appeal to each other's basic decency\r\ninstead of our basest fears. A better politics is one where we debate\r\nwithout demonizing each other, where we talk issues and values and\r\nprinciples and facts rather than \"gotcha\" moments or trivial gaffes or\r\nfake controversies that have nothing to do with people's daily lives.\r\n\r\nA politics--a better politics is one where we spend less time drowning\r\nin dark money for ads that pull us into the gutter and spend more time\r\nlifting young people up with a sense of purpose and possibility, asking\r\nthem to join in the great mission of building America.\r\n\r\nIf we're going to have arguments, let's have arguments, but let's make\r\nthem debates worthy of this body and worthy of this country. We still\r\nmay not agree on a woman's right to choose, but surely we can agree\r\nit's a good thing that teen pregnancies and abortions are nearing\r\nalltime lows and that every woman should have access to the health care\r\nthat she needs.\r\n\r\nYes, passions still fly on immigration, but surely we can all see\r\nsomething of ourselves in the striving young student and agree that no\r\none benefits when a hard-working mom is snatched from her child and\r\nthat it's possible to shape a law that upholds our tradition as a\r\nnation of laws and a nation of immigrants. I've talked to Republicans\r\nand Democrats about that. That's something that we can share.\r\n\r\nWe may go at it in campaign season, but surely we can agree that the\r\nright to vote is sacred, that it's being denied to too many, and that\r\non this 50th anniversary of the great march from Selma to Montgomery\r\nand the passage of the Voting Rights Act, we can come together,\r\nDemocrats and Republicans, to make voting easier for every single\r\nAmerican.\r\n\r\nWe may have different takes on the events of Ferguson and New York. But\r\nsurely we can understand a father who fears his son can't walk home\r\nwithout being harassed. And surely we can understand the wife who won't\r\nrest until the police officer she married walks through the front door\r\nat the end of his shift. And surely we can agree that it's a good thing\r\nthat for the first time in 40 years, the crime rate and the\r\nincarceration rate have come down together, and use that as a starting\r\npoint for Democrats and Republicans, community leaders and law\r\nenforcement, to reform America's criminal justice system so that it\r\nprotects and serves all of us.\r\n\r\nThat's a better politics. That's how we start rebuilding trust. That's\r\nhow we move this country forward. That's what the American people want.\r\nAnd that's what they deserve.\r\n\r\nI have no more campaigns to run.\r\n\r\n[At this point, some audience members applauded.]\r\n\r\nMy only agenda--[laughter]. Audience member. [Inaudible]\r\n\r\nThe President. I know because I won both of them. [Laughter] My only\r\nagenda for the next 2 years is the same as the one I've had since the\r\nday I swore an oath on the steps of this Capitol: to do what I believe\r\nis best for America. If you share the broad vision I outlined tonight,\r\nI ask you to join me in the work at hand. If you disagree with parts of\r\nit, I hope you'll at least work with me where you do agree. And I\r\ncommit to every Republican here tonight that I will not only seek out\r\nyour ideas, I will seek to work with you to make this country stronger.\r\n\r\nBecause I want this Chamber, I want this city to reflect the truth:\r\nthat for all our blind spots and shortcomings, we are a people with the\r\nstrength and generosity of spirit to bridge divides, to unite in common\r\neffort, to help our neighbors, whether down the street or on the other\r\nside of the world.\r\n\r\nI want our actions to tell every child in every neighborhood, your life\r\nmatters, and we are committed to improving your life chances, as\r\ncommitted as we are to working on behalf of our own kids. I want future\r\ngenerations to know that we are a people who see our differences as a\r\ngreat gift, that we're a people who value the dignity and worth of\r\nevery citizen: man and woman, young and old, Black and White, Latino,\r\nAsian, immigrant, Native American, gay, straight, Americans with mental\r\nillness or physical disability. Everybody matters. I want them to grow\r\nup in a country that shows the world what we still know to be true:\r\nthat we are still more than a collection of red States and blue States,\r\nthat we are the United States of America.\r\n\r\nI want them to grow up in a country where a young mom can sit down and\r\nwrite a letter to her President with a story that sums up these past 6\r\nyears: \"It's amazing what you can bounce back from when you have\r\nto. . . . We are a strong, tight-knit family who's made it through some\r\nvery, very hard times.\"\r\n\r\nMy fellow Americans, we too are a strong, tight-knit family. We too\r\nhave made it through some hard times. Fifteen years into this new\r\ncentury, we have picked ourselves up, dusted ourselves off, and begun\r\nagain the work of remaking America. We have laid a new foundation. A\r\nbrighter future is ours to write. Let's begin this new chapter together,\r\nand let's start the work right now.\r\n\r\nThank you. God bless you. God bless this country we love. Thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\nAddress Before a Joint Session of the Congress on the State of the Union\r\nBarack Obama\r\nJanuary 12, 2016\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, my\r\nfellow Americans: Tonight marks the eighth year that I've come here to\r\nreport on the State of the Union. And for this final one, I'm going to\r\ntry to make it a little shorter. I know some of you are antsy to get\r\nback to Iowa. [Laughter] I've been there. I'll be shaking hands\r\nafterwards if you want some tips. [Laughter]\r\n\r\nNow, I understand that because it's an election season, expectations\r\nfor what we will achieve this year are low. But, Mr. Speaker, I\r\nappreciate the constructive approach that you and other leaders took at\r\nthe end of last year to pass a budget and make tax cuts permanent for\r\nworking families. So I hope we can work together this year on some\r\nbipartisan priorities like criminal justice reform and helping people\r\nwho are battling prescription drug abuse and heroin abuse. So, who\r\nknows, we might surprise the cynics again.\r\n\r\nBut tonight I want to go easy on the traditional list of proposals for\r\nthe year ahead. Don't worry, I've got plenty--[laughter]--from helping\r\nstudents learn to write computer code to personalizing medical\r\ntreatments for patients. And I will keep pushing for progress on the\r\nwork that I believe still needs to be done: fixing a broken immigration\r\nsystem, protecting our kids from gun violence, equal pay for equal work,\r\npaid leave, raising the minimum wage. All these things still matter to\r\nhard-working families. They're still the right thing to do. And I won't\r\nlet up until they get done.\r\n\r\nBut for my final address to this Chamber, I don't want to just talk\r\nabout next year. I want to focus on the next 5 years, the next 10 years,\r\nand beyond. I want to focus on our future.\r\n\r\nWe live in a time of extraordinary change, change that's reshaping the\r\nway we live, the way we work, our planet, our place in the world. It's\r\nchange that promises amazing medical breakthroughs, but also economic\r\ndisruptions that strain working families. It promises this education\r\nfor girls in the most remote villages, but also connects terrorists\r\nplotting an ocean away. It's change that can broaden opportunity or\r\nwiden inequality. And whether we like it or not, the pace of this\r\nchange will only accelerate.\r\n\r\nAmerica has been through big changes before: wars and depression, the\r\ninflux of new immigrants, workers fighting for a fair deal, movements\r\nto expand civil rights. Each time, there have been those who told us to\r\nfear the future; who claimed we could slam the brakes on change; who\r\npromised to restore past glory if we just got some group or idea that\r\nwas threatening America under control. And each time, we overcame those\r\nfears. We did not, in the words of Lincoln, adhere to the \"dogmas of\r\nthe quiet past.\" Instead, we thought anew and acted anew. We made\r\nchange work for us, always extending America's promise outward, to the\r\nnext frontier, to more people. And because we did, because we saw\r\nopportunity with a--where others saw peril, we emerged stronger and\r\nbetter than before.\r\n\r\nWhat was true then can be true now. Our unique strengths as a nation--\r\nour optimism and work ethic, our spirit of discovery, our diversity,\r\nour commitment to rule of law--these things give us everything we need\r\nto ensure prosperity and security for generations to come.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it's in that spirit that we have made progress these past 7\r\nyears. That's how we recovered from the worst economic crisis in\r\ngenerations. That's how we reformed our health care system and\r\nreinvented our energy sector. That's how we delivered more care and\r\nbenefits to our troops coming home and our veterans. That's how we\r\nsecured the freedom in every State to marry the person we love.\r\n\r\nBut such progress is not inevitable. It's the result of choices we make\r\ntogether. And we face such choices right now. Will we respond to the\r\nchanges of our time with fear, turning inward as a nation, turning\r\nagainst each other as a people? Or will we face the future with\r\nconfidence in who we are, in what we stand for, in the incredible\r\nthings that we can do together?\r\n\r\nSo let's talk about the future and four big questions that I believe we\r\nas a country have to answer, regardless of who the next President is or\r\nwho controls the next Congress. First, how do we give everyone a fair\r\nshot at opportunity and security in this new economy? Second, how do we\r\nmake technology work for us and not against us, especially when it\r\ncomes to solving urgent challenges like climate change? Third, how do\r\nwe keep America safe and lead the world without becoming its policeman?\r\nAnd finally, how can we make our politics reflect what's best in us and\r\nnot what's worst?\r\n\r\nLet me start with the economy and a basic fact: The United States of\r\nAmerica right now has the strongest, most durable economy in the world.\r\nWe're in the middle of the longest streak of private sector job\r\ncreation in history. More than 14 million new jobs, the strongest 2\r\nyears of job growth since the 1990s, an unemployment rate cut in half.\r\nOur auto industry just had its best year ever. That's just part of a\r\nmanufacturing surge that's created nearly 900,000 new jobs in the past\r\n6 years. And we've done all this while cutting our deficits by almost\r\nthree-quarters.\r\n\r\nAnyone claiming that America's economy is in decline is peddling\r\nfiction. Now, what is true--and the reason that a lot of Americans feel\r\nanxious--is that the economy has been changing in profound ways, changes\r\nthat started long before the great recession hit, changes that have not\r\nlet up.\r\n\r\nToday, technology doesn't just replace jobs on the assembly line, but\r\nany job where work can be automated. Companies in a global economy can\r\nlocate anywhere, and they face tougher competition. As a result,\r\nworkers have less leverage for a raise. Companies have less loyalty to\r\ntheir communities. And more and more wealth and income is concentrated\r\nat the very top.\r\n\r\nAll these trends have squeezed workers, even when they have jobs, even\r\nwhen the economy is growing. It's made it harder for a hard-working\r\nfamily to pull itself out of poverty, harder for young people to start\r\ntheir careers, tougher for workers to retire when they want to. And\r\nalthough none of these trends are unique to America, they do offend our\r\nuniquely American belief that everybody who works hard should get a\r\nfair shot.\r\n\r\nFor the past 7 years, our goal has been a growing economy that also\r\nworks better for everybody. We've made progress, but we need to make\r\nmore. And despite all the political arguments that we've had these past\r\nfew years, there are actually some areas where Americans broadly agree.\r\n\r\nWe agree that real opportunity requires every American to get the\r\neducation and training they need to land a good-paying job. The\r\nbipartisan reform of No Child Left Behind was an important start, and\r\ntogether, we've increased early childhood education, lifted high school\r\ngraduation rates to new highs, boosted graduates in fields like\r\nengineering. In the coming years, we should build on that progress, by\r\nproviding pre-K for all and offering every student the hands-on\r\ncomputer science and math classes that make them job-ready on day one.\r\nWe should recruit and support more great teachers for our kids.\r\n\r\nAnd we have to make college affordable for every American. No hard-\r\nworking student should be stuck in the red. We've already reduced\r\nstudent loan payments by--to 10 percent of a borrower's income. And\r\nthat's good. But now we've actually got to cut the cost of college.\r\nProviding 2 years of community college at no cost for every responsible\r\nstudent is one of the best ways to do that, and I'm going to keep\r\nfighting to get that started this year. It's the right thing to do.\r\n\r\nBut a great education isn't all we need in this new economy. We also\r\nneed benefits and protections that provide a basic measure of security.\r\nIt's not too much of a stretch to say that some of the only people in\r\nAmerica who are going to work the same job, in the same place, with a\r\nhealth and retirement package for 30 years are sitting in this Chamber.\r\n[Laughter] For everyone else, especially folks in their forties and\r\nfifties, saving for retirement or bouncing back from job loss has\r\ngotten a lot tougher. Americans understand that at some point in their\r\ncareers, in this new economy, they may have to retool, they may have to\r\nretrain. But they shouldn't lose what they've already worked so hard to\r\nbuild in the process.\r\n\r\nThat's why Social Security and Medicare are more important than ever.\r\nWe shouldn't weaken them, we should strengthen them. And for Americans\r\nshort of retirement, basic benefits should be just as mobile as\r\neverything else is today. That, by the way, is what the Affordable Care\r\nAct is all about. It's about filling the gaps in employer-based care so\r\nthat when you lose a job or you go back to school or you strike out and\r\nlaunch that new business, you'll still have coverage. Nearly 18 million\r\npeople have gained coverage so far. And in the process, health care\r\ninflation has slowed. And our businesses have created jobs every single\r\nmonth since it became law.\r\n\r\nNow, I'm guessing we won't agree on health care anytime soon, but--\r\n[laughter]--a little applause back there. [Laughter] Just a guess. But\r\nthere should be other ways parties can work together to improve\r\neconomic security. Say a hard-working American loses his job. We\r\nshouldn't just make sure that he can get unemployment insurance, we\r\nshould make sure that program encourages him to retrain for a business\r\nthat's ready to hire him. If that new job doesn't pay as much, there\r\nshould be a system of wage insurance in place so that he can still pay\r\nhis bills. And even if he's going from job to job, he should still be\r\nable to save for retirement and take his savings with him. That's the\r\nway we make the new economy work better for everybody.\r\n\r\nI also know Speaker Ryan has talked about his interest in tackling\r\npoverty. America is about giving everybody willing to work a chance, a\r\nhand up. And I'd welcome a serious discussion about strategies we can\r\nall support, like expanding tax cuts for low-income workers who don't\r\nhave children.\r\n\r\nBut there are some areas where--we just have to be honest--it has been\r\ndifficult to find agreement over the last 7 years. And a lot of them\r\nfall under the category of what role the Government should play in\r\nmaking sure the system's not rigged in favor of the wealthiest and\r\nbiggest corporations. And it's an honest disagreement, and the American\r\npeople have a choice to make.\r\n\r\nI believe a thriving private sector is the lifeblood of our economy. I\r\nthink there are outdated regulations that need to be changed. There is\r\nredtape that needs to be cut. [Applause] There you go! Yes! See? But\r\nafter years now of record corporate profits, working families won't get\r\nmore opportunity or bigger paychecks just by letting big banks or big\r\noil or hedge funds make their own rules at everybody else's expense.\r\nMiddle class families are not going to feel more secure because we\r\nallowed attacks on collective bargaining to go unanswered. Food stamp\r\nrecipients did not cause the financial crisis; recklessness on Wall\r\nStreet did. Immigrants aren't the principal reason wages haven't gone\r\nup; those decisions are made in the boardrooms that all too often put\r\nquarterly earnings over long-term returns. It's sure not the average\r\nfamily watching tonight that avoids paying taxes through offshore\r\naccounts. [Laughter]\r\n\r\nThe point is, I believe that in this new economy, workers and startups\r\nand small businesses need more of a voice, not less. The rules should\r\nwork for them. And I'm not alone in this. This year, I plan to lift up\r\nthe many businesses who have figured out that doing right by their\r\nworkers or their customers or their communities ends up being good for\r\ntheir shareholders. And I want to spread those best practices across\r\nAmerica. That's part of a brighter future.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it turns, out many of our best corporate citizens are also our\r\nmost creative. And this brings me to the second big question we as a\r\ncountry have to answer: How do we reignite that spirit of innovation to\r\nmeet our biggest challenges?\r\n\r\nSixty years ago, when the Russians beat us into space, we didn't deny\r\nSputnik was up there. [Laughter] We didn't argue about the science or\r\nshrink our research and development budget. We built a space program\r\nalmost overnight. And 12 years later, we were walking on the Moon.\r\n\r\nNow, that spirit of discovery is in our DNA. America is Thomas Edison\r\nand the Wright Brothers and George Washington Carver. America is Grace\r\nHopper and Katherine Johnson and Sally Ride. America is every immigrant\r\nand entrepreneur from Boston to Austin to Silicon Valley, racing to\r\nshape a better future. That's who we are.\r\n\r\nAnd over the past 7 years, we've nurtured that spirit. We've protected\r\nan open Internet and taken bold new steps to get more students and low-\r\nincome Americans online. We've launched next-generation manufacturing\r\nhubs and online tools that give an entrepreneur everything he or she\r\nneeds to start a business in a single day. But we can do so much more.\r\n\r\nLast year, Vice President Biden said that with a new moonshot, America\r\ncan cure cancer. Last month, he worked with this Congress to give\r\nscientists at the National Institutes of Health the strongest resources\r\nthat they've had in over a decade. Well--so tonight I'm announcing a new\r\nnational effort to get it done. And because he's gone to the mat for\r\nall of us on so many issues over the past 40 years, I'm putting Joe in\r\ncharge of mission control. For the loved ones we've all lost, for the\r\nfamilies that we can still save, let's make America the country that\r\ncures cancer once and for all. What do you say, Joe? Let's make it\r\nhappen.\r\n\r\nNow, medical research is critical. We need the same level of commitment\r\nwhen it comes to developing clean energy sources. Look, if anybody\r\nstill wants to dispute the science around climate change, have at it.\r\n[Laughter] You will be pretty lonely, because you'll be debating our\r\nmilitary, most of America's business leaders, the majority of the\r\nAmerican people, almost the entire scientific community, and 200\r\nnations around the world who agree it's a problem and intend to solve\r\nit. But even if the planet wasn't at stake, even if 2014 wasn't the\r\nwarmest year on record--until 2015 turned out to be even hotter--why\r\nwould we want to pass up the chance for American businesses to produce\r\nand sell the energy of the future? Listen, 7 years ago, we made the\r\nsingle biggest investment in clean energy in our history. Here are the\r\nresults. In fields from Iowa to Texas, wind power is now cheaper than\r\ndirtier, conventional power. On rooftops from Arizona to New York,\r\nsolar is saving Americans tens of millions of dollars a year on their\r\nenergy bills and employs more Americans than coal in jobs that pay\r\nbetter than average. We're taking steps to give homeowners the freedom\r\nto generate and store their own energy, something, by the way, that\r\nenvironmentalists and Tea Partiers have teamed up to support. And\r\nmeanwhile, we've cut our imports of foreign oil by nearly 60 percent\r\nand cut carbon pollution more than any other country on Earth. Gas\r\nunder 2 bucks a gallon ain't bad either. [Laughter]\r\n\r\nNow we've got to accelerate the transition away from old, dirtier\r\nenergy sources. Rather than subsidize the past, we should invest in the\r\nfuture, especially in communities that rely on fossil fuels. We do them\r\nno favor when we don't show them where the trends are going. And that's\r\nwhy I'm going to push to change the way we manage our oil and coal\r\nresources so that they better reflect the costs they impose on\r\ntaxpayers and our planet. And that way, we put money back into those\r\ncommunities and put tens of thousands of Americans to work building a\r\n21st-century transportation system.\r\n\r\nNow, none of this is going to happen overnight. And yes, there are\r\nplenty of entrenched interests who want to protect the status quo. But\r\nthe jobs we'll create, the money we'll save, the planet we'll preserve--\r\nthat is the kind of future our kids and our grandkids deserve. And it's\r\nwithin our grasp.\r\n\r\nNow, climate change is just one of many issues where our security is\r\nlinked to the rest of the world. And that's why the third big question\r\nthat we have to answer together is how to keep America safe and strong\r\nwithout either isolating ourselves or trying to nation-build everywhere\r\nthere's a problem.\r\n\r\nNow, I told you earlier all the talk of America's economic decline is\r\npolitical hot air. Well, so is all the rhetoric you hear about our\r\nenemies getting stronger and America getting weaker. Let me tell you\r\nsomething: The United States of America is the most powerful nation on\r\nEarth. Period. [Applause] Period. It's not even close. [Applause] It's\r\nnot even close. It's not even close. We spend more on our military than\r\nthe next eight nations combined. Our troops are the finest fighting\r\nforce in the history of the world. [Applause] All right. No nation\r\nattacks us directly, or our allies, because they know that's the path\r\nto ruin. Surveys show our standing around the world is higher than when\r\nI was elected to this office, and when it comes to every important\r\ninternational issue, people of the world do not look to Beijing or\r\nMoscow to lead. They call us. So I think it's useful to level set here,\r\nbecause when we don't, we don't make good decisions.\r\n\r\nNow, as someone who begins every day with an intelligence briefing, I\r\nknow this is a dangerous time. But that's not primarily because of some\r\nlooming superpower out there, and it's certainly not because of\r\ndiminished American strength. In today's world, we're threatened less\r\nby evil empires and more by failing states.\r\n\r\nThe Middle East is going through a transformation that will play out\r\nfor a generation, rooted in conflicts that date back millennia.\r\nEconomic headwinds are blowing in from a Chinese economy that is in\r\nsignificant transition. Even as their economy severely contracts,\r\nRussia is pouring resources in to prop up Ukraine and Syria, client\r\nstates that they saw slipping away from their orbit. And the\r\ninternational system we built after World War II is now struggling to\r\nkeep pace with this new reality. It's up to us, the United States of\r\nAmerica, to help remake that system. And to do that well, it means that\r\nwe've got to set priorities. Priority number one is protecting the\r\nAmerican people and going after terrorist networks. Both Al Qaida and\r\nnow ISIL pose a direct threat to our people, because in today's world,\r\neven a handful of terrorists who place no value on human life,\r\nincluding their own, can do a lot of damage. They use the Internet to\r\npoison the minds of individuals inside our country. Their actions\r\nundermine and destabilize our allies. We have to take them out.\r\n\r\nBut as we focus on destroying ISIL, over-the-top claims that this is\r\nworld war III just play into their hands. Masses of fighters on the\r\nback of pickup trucks, twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages,\r\nthey pose an enormous danger to civilians; they have to be stopped. But\r\nthey do not threaten our national existence. That is the story ISIL\r\nwants to tell. That's the kind of propaganda they use to recruit. We\r\ndon't need to build them up to show that we're serious, and we sure\r\ndon't need to push away vital allies in this fight by echoing the lie\r\nthat ISIL is somehow representative of one of the world's largest\r\nreligions. We just need to call them what they are: killers and\r\nfanatics who have to be rooted out, hunted down, and destroyed.\r\n\r\nAnd that's exactly what we're doing. For more than a year, America has\r\nled a coalition of more than 60 countries to cut off ISIL's financing,\r\ndisrupt their plots, stop the flow of terrorist fighters, and stamp out\r\ntheir vicious ideology. With nearly 10,000 airstrikes, we're taking out\r\ntheir leadership, their oil, their training camps, their weapons. We're\r\ntraining, arming, and supporting forces who are steadily reclaiming\r\nterritory in Iraq and Syria.\r\n\r\nIf this Congress is serious about winning this war and wants to send a\r\nmessage to our troops and the world, authorize the use of military\r\nforce against ISIL. Take a vote. [Applause] Take a vote. But the\r\nAmerican people should know that with or without congressional action,\r\nISIL will learn the same lessons as terrorists before them. If you\r\ndoubt America's commitment--or mine--to see that justice is done, just\r\nask Usama bin Laden. Ask the leader of Al Qaida in Yemen, who was taken\r\nout last year, or the perpetrator of the Benghazi attacks, who sits in\r\na prison cell. When you come after Americans, we go after you. And it\r\nmay take time, but we have long memories, and our reach has no limits.\r\n\r\nOur foreign policy has to be focused on the threat from ISIL and Al\r\nQaida, but it can't stop there. For even without ISIL, even without Al\r\nQaida, instability will continue for decades in many parts of the world:\r\nin the Middle East, in Afghanistan and parts of Pakistan, in parts of\r\nCentral America, in Africa and Asia. Some of these places may become\r\nsafe havens for new terrorist networks. Others will just fall victim to\r\nethnic conflict or famine, feeding the next wave of refugees. The world\r\nwill look to us to help solve these problems, and our answer needs to\r\nbe more than tough talk or calls to carpet-bomb civilians. That may\r\nwork as a TV sound bite, but it doesn't pass muster on the world stage.\r\n\r\nWe also can't try to take over and rebuild every country that falls\r\ninto crisis, even if it's done with the best of intentions. That's not\r\nleadership; that's a recipe for quagmire, spilling American blood and\r\ntreasure that ultimately will weaken us. It's the lesson of Vietnam;\r\nit's the lesson of Iraq. And we should have learned it by now.\r\n\r\nNow, fortunately there is a smarter approach: a patient and disciplined\r\nstrategy that uses every element of our national power. It says America\r\nwill always act, alone if necessary, to protect our people and our\r\nallies, but on issues of global concern, we will mobilize the world to\r\nwork with us and make sure other countries pull their own weight.\r\nThat's our approach to conflicts like Syria, where we're partnering\r\nwith local forces and leading international efforts to help that broken\r\nsociety pursue a lasting peace. That's why we built a global coalition,\r\nwith sanctions and principled diplomacy, to prevent a nuclear-armed\r\nIran. And as we speak, Iran has rolled back its nuclear program,\r\nshipped out its uranium stockpile, and the world has avoided another\r\nwar.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat's how we stopped the spread of Ebola in West Africa. Our military,\r\nour doctors, our development workers--they were heroic; they set up the\r\nplatform that then allowed other countries to join in behind us and\r\nstamp out that epidemic. Hundreds of thousands, maybe a couple million,\r\nlives were saved.\r\n\r\nThat's how we forged a Trans-Pacific Partnership to open markets and\r\nprotect workers and the environment and advance American leadership in\r\nAsia. It cuts 18,000 taxes on products made in America, which will then\r\nsupport more good jobs here in America. With TPP, China does not set\r\nthe rules in that region, we do. You want to show our strength in this\r\nnew century? Approve this agreement. Give us the tools to enforce it.\r\nIt's the right thing to do.\r\n\r\nLet me give you another example. Fifty years of isolating Cuba had\r\nfailed to promote democracy. It set us back in Latin America. That's\r\nwhy we restored diplomatic relations, opened the door to travel and\r\ncommerce, positioned ourselves to improve the lives of the Cuban people.\r\nSo if you want to consolidate our leadership and credibility in the\r\nhemisphere, recognize that the cold war is over. Lift the embargo.\r\n\r\nThe point is, American leadership in the 21st century is not a choice\r\nbetween ignoring the rest of the world--except when we kill terrorists--\r\nor occupying and rebuilding whatever society is unraveling. Leadership\r\nmeans a wise application of military power and rallying the world\r\nbehind causes that are right. It means seeing our foreign assistance as\r\na part of our national security, not something separate, not charity.\r\n\r\nWhen we lead nearly 200 nations to the most ambitious agreement in\r\nhistory to fight climate change, yes, that helps vulnerable countries,\r\nbut it also protects our kids. When we help Ukraine defend its\r\ndemocracy or Colombia resolve a decades-long war, that strengthens the\r\ninternational order we depend on. When we help African countries feed\r\ntheir people and care for the sick, it's the right thing to do, and it\r\nprevents the next pandemic from reaching our shores. Right now we're on\r\ntrack to end the scourge of HIV/AIDS. That's within our grasp. And we\r\nhave the chance to accomplish the same thing with malaria, something\r\nI'll be pushing this Congress to fund this year.\r\n\r\nThat's American strength. That's American leadership. And that kind of\r\nleadership depends on the power of our example. That's why I will keep\r\nworking to shut down the prison at Guantanamo. It is expensive, it is\r\nunnecessary, and it only serves as a recruitment brochure for our\r\nenemies. There's a better way.\r\n\r\nAnd that's why we need to reject any politics--any politics--that targets\r\npeople because of race or religion. Let me just say this. This is not a\r\nmatter of political correctness, this is a matter of understanding just\r\nwhat it is that makes us strong. The world respects us not just for our\r\narsenal, it respects us for our diversity and our openness and the way\r\nwe respect every faith.\r\n\r\nHis Holiness Pope Francis told this body from the very spot that I'm\r\nstanding on tonight that \"to imitate the hatred and violence of tyrants\r\nand murderers is the best way to take their place.\" When politicians\r\ninsult Muslims, whether abroad or our fellow citizens, when a mosque is\r\nvandalized or a kid is called names, that doesn't make us safer. That's\r\nnot telling it what--telling it like it is. It's just wrong. It\r\ndiminishes us in the eyes of the world. It makes it harder to achieve\r\nour goals. It betrays who we are as a country. \"We the People.\" Our\r\nConstitution begins with those three simple words, words we've come to\r\nrecognize mean all the people, not just some; words that insist we rise\r\nand fall together, that that's how we might perfect our Union. And that\r\nbrings me to the fourth and maybe most important thing that I want to\r\nsay tonight.\r\n\r\nThe future we want--all of us want--opportunity and security for our\r\nfamilies, a rising standard of living, a sustainable, peaceful planet\r\nfor our kids--all that is within our reach. But it will only happen if\r\nwe work together. It will only happen if we can have rational,\r\nconstructive debates. It will only happen if we fix our politics.\r\n\r\nA better politics doesn't mean we have to agree on everything. This is\r\na big country: different regions, different attitudes, different\r\ninterests. That's one of our strengths too. Our Founders distributed\r\npower between States and branches of government and expected us to\r\nargue, just as they did, fiercely, over the size and shape of\r\ngovernment, over commerce and foreign relations, over the meaning of\r\nliberty and the imperatives of security.\r\n\r\nBut democracy does require basic bonds of trust between its citizens.\r\nIt doesn't work if we think the people who disagree with us are all\r\nmotivated by malice. It doesn't work if we think that our political\r\nopponents are unpatriotic or trying to weaken America. Democracy grinds\r\nto a halt without a willingness to compromise or when even basic facts\r\nare contested or when we listen only to those who agree with us. Our\r\npublic life withers when only the most extreme voices get all the\r\nattention. And most of all, democracy breaks down when the average\r\nperson feels their voice doesn't matter, that the system is rigged in\r\nfavor of the rich or the powerful or some special interest.\r\n\r\nToo many Americans feel that way right now. It's one of the few regrets\r\nof my Presidency: that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has\r\ngotten worse instead of better. I have no doubt, a President with the\r\ngifts of Lincoln or Roosevelt might have better bridged the divide, and\r\nI guarantee, I'll keep trying to be better so long as I hold this\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nBut, my fellow Americans, this cannot be my task--or any President's--\r\nalone. There are a whole lot of folks in this Chamber, good people, who\r\nwould like to see more cooperation, would like to see a more elevated\r\ndebate in Washington, but feel trapped by the imperatives of getting\r\nelected, by the noise coming out of your base. I know; you've told me.\r\nIt's the worst kept secret in Washington. And a lot of you aren't\r\nenjoying being trapped in that kind of rancor.\r\n\r\nBut that means if we want a better politics--and I'm addressing the\r\nAmerican people now--if we want a better politics, it's not enough just\r\nto change a Congressman or change a Senator or even change a President.\r\nWe have to change the system to reflect our better selves.\r\n\r\nI think we've got to end the practice of drawing our congressional\r\ndistricts so that politicians can pick their voters and not the other\r\nway around. Let a bipartisan group do it.\r\n\r\nI believe we've got to reduce the influence of money in our politics so\r\nthat a handful of families or hidden interests can't bankroll our\r\nelections. And if our existing approach to campaign finance reform\r\ncan't pass muster in the courts, we need to work together to find a\r\nreal solution. Because it's a problem. And most of you don't like\r\nraising money. [Laughter] I know. I've done it.\r\n\r\nWe've got to make it easier to vote, not harder. We need to modernize\r\nit for the way we live now. This is America: We want to make it easier\r\nfor people to participate. And over the course of this year, I intend\r\nto travel the country to push for reforms that do just that. But I\r\ncan't do these things on my own. Changes in our political process--in\r\nnot just who gets elected, but how they get elected--that will only\r\nhappen when the American people demand it. It depends on you. That's\r\nwhat's meant by a government of, by, and for the people.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm suggesting is hard. It's a lot easier to be cynical; to accept\r\nthat change is not possible and politics is hopeless and the problem is,\r\nall the folks who are elected don't care; and to believe that our\r\nvoices and our actions don't matter. But if we give up now, then we\r\nforsake a better future. Those with money and power will gain greater\r\ncontrol over the decisions that could send a young soldier to war or\r\nallow another economic disaster or roll back the equal rights and\r\nvoting rights that generations of Americans have fought, even died, to\r\nsecure. And then, as frustration grows, there will be voices urging us\r\nto fall back into our respective tribes, to scapegoat fellow citizens\r\nwho don't look like us or pray like us or vote like we do or share the\r\nsame background.\r\n\r\nWe can't afford to go down that path. It won't deliver the economy we\r\nwant. It will not produce the security we want. But most of all, it\r\ncontradicts everything that makes us the envy of the world.\r\n\r\nSo, my fellow Americans, whatever you may believe, whether you prefer\r\none party or no party, whether you supported my agenda or fought as\r\nhard as you could against it, our collective futures depends on your\r\nwillingness to uphold your duties as a citizen. To vote. To speak out.\r\nTo stand up for others, especially the weak, especially the vulnerable,\r\nknowing that each of us is only here because somebody, somewhere, stood\r\nup for us. We need every American to stay active in our public life--and\r\nnot just during election time--so that our public life reflects the\r\ngoodness and the decency that I see in the American people every single\r\nday.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy. Our brand of democracy is hard. But I can promise that\r\na little over a year from now, when I no longer hold this office, I\r\nwill be right there with you as a citizen, inspired by those voices of\r\nfairness and vision, of grit and good humor and kindness, that have\r\nhelped America travel so far. Voices that help us see ourselves not,\r\nfirst and foremost, as Black or White or Asian or Latino, not as gay or\r\nstraight, immigrant or native born, not Democrat or Republican, but as\r\nAmericans first, bound by a common creed. Voices Dr. King believed\r\nwould have the final word: voices of \"unarmed truth and unconditional\r\nlove.\"\r\n\r\nAnd they're out there, those voices. They don't get a lot of attention;\r\nthey don't seek a lot of fanfare; but they're busy doing the work this\r\ncountry needs doing. I see them everywhere I travel in this incredible\r\ncountry of ours. I see you, the American people. And in your daily acts\r\nof citizenship, I see our future unfolding.\r\n\r\nI see it in the worker on the assembly line who clocked extra shifts to\r\nkeep his company open and the boss who pays him higher wages instead of\r\nlaying him off. I see it in the dreamer who stays up late at night to\r\nfinish her science project and the teacher who comes in early, maybe\r\nwith some extra supplies that she bought because she knows that that\r\nyoung girl might someday cure a disease.\r\n\r\nI see it in the American who served his time, made bad mistakes as a\r\nchild, but now is dreaming of starting over. And I see it in the\r\nbusiness owner who gives him that second chance. The protester\r\ndetermined to prove that justice matters and the young cop walking the\r\nbeat, treating everybody with respect, doing the brave, quiet work of\r\nkeeping us safe.\r\n\r\nI see it in the soldier who gives almost everything to save his\r\nbrothers, the nurse who tends to him till he can run a marathon, the\r\ncommunity that lines up to cheer him on. It's the son who finds the\r\ncourage to come out as who he is and the father whose love for that son\r\noverrides everything he's been taught.\r\n\r\nI see it in the elderly woman who will wait in line to cast her vote as\r\nlong as she has to, the new citizen who casts his vote for the first\r\ntime, the volunteers at the polls who believe every vote should count.\r\nBecause each of them, in different ways, know how much that precious\r\nright is worth.\r\n\r\nThat's the America I know. That's the country we love: clear eyed, big\r\nhearted, undaunted by challenge. Optimistic that unarmed truth and\r\nunconditional love will have the final word. That's what makes me so\r\nhopeful about our future. I believe in change because I believe in you,\r\nthe American people. And that's why I stand here as confident as I have\r\never been that the state of our Union is strong.\r\n\r\nThank you. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. Thank\r\nyou.",
