Clinton\r\nJanuary 25, 1994\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker, Mr. President, members of the 103rd Congress, my fellow\r\nAmericans:\r\n\r\nI am not sure what speech is in the TelePrompTer tonight, but I hope we can\r\ntalk about the State of the Union.\r\n\r\nI ask you to begin by recalling the memory of the giant who presided over\r\nthis chamber with such force and grace. Tip O'Neill liked to call himself\r\n\"A Man of the House\" and he surely was that. But even more, he was a man of\r\nthe people, a bricklayer's son who helped to build the great American\r\nmiddle class. Tip O'Neill never forgot who he was, where he came from, or\r\nwho sent him here. Tonight he's smiling down on us for the first time from\r\nthe Lord's gallery. But in his honor, may we too also remember who we are,\r\nwhere we come from, and who sent us here.\r\n\r\nIf we do that we will return over and over again to the principle that if\r\nwe simply give ordinary people equal opportunity, quality education, and a\r\nfair shot at the American dream, they will do extraordinary things.\r\n\r\nWe gather tonight in a world of changes so profound and rapid that all\r\nnations are tested. Our American heritage has always been to master such\r\nchange, to use it to expand opportunity at home, and our leadership abroad.\r\nBut for too long and in too many ways, that heritage was abandoned, and our\r\ncountry drifted.\r\n\r\nFor 30 years family life in America has been breaking down. For 20 years\r\nthe wages of working people have been stagnant or declining. For the 12\r\nyears of trickle down economics we built a false prosperity on a hollow\r\nbase as our national debt quadrupled. From 1989 to 1992 we experienced the\r\nslowest growth in a half century. For too many families, even when both\r\nparents were working, the American dream has been slipping away.\r\n\r\nIn 1992 the American people demanded that we change. I year ago I asked all\r\nof you to join me in accepting responsibility for the future of our\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nWell, we did. We replaced drift and deadlock with renewal and reform. And I\r\nwant to thank every one of you here who heard the American people, who\r\nbroke gridlock, who gave them the most successful teamwork between a\r\npresident and a Congress in 30 years.\r\n\r\nAccomplishments\r\n\r\nThis Congress produced a budget that cut the deficit by half a trillion\r\ndollars, cut spending and raised income taxes on only the wealthiest\r\nAmericans. This Congress produced tax relief for millions of low-income\r\nworkers to reward work over welfare. It produced NAFTA. It produced the\r\nBrady bill, now the Brady law.\r\n\r\nAnd thank you, Jim Brady, for being here, and God bless you, Sarah. This\r\nCongress produced tax cuts to reduce the taxes of nine out of 10 small\r\nbusinesses who use the money to invest more and create more jobs. It\r\nproduced more research and treatment for AIDS, more childhood\r\nimmunizations, more support for women's health research, more affordable\r\ncollege loans for the middle class, a new national service program for\r\nthose who want to give something back to their country and their\r\ncommunities for higher education, a dramatic increase in high-tech\r\ninvestments to move us from a defense to a domestic high-tech economy. This\r\nCongress produced a new law--the motor voter bill--to help millions of\r\npeople register to vote. It produced family and medical leave--all passed,\r\nall signed into law, with not one single veto.\r\n\r\nThese accomplishments were all commitments I made when I sought this\r\noffice, and in fairness, they all had to be passed by you in this Congress.\r\nBut I am persuaded that the real credit belongs to the people who sent us\r\nhere, who pay our salaries, who hold our feet to the fire. But what we do\r\nhere is really beginning to change lives. Let me just give you one\r\nexample.\r\n\r\nFamily And Medical Leave\r\n\r\nI will never forget what the family and medical leave law meant to just one\r\nfather I met early one Sunday morning in the White House. It was unusual to\r\nsee a family there touring early Sunday morning, but he had his wife and\r\nhis three children there, one of them in a wheelchair. And I came up, and\r\nafter we had our picture taken and had a little visit, I was walking off,\r\nand that man grabbed me by the arm and he said, \"Mr. President, let me tell\r\nyou something. My little girl here is desperately ill. She's probably not\r\ngoing to make it. But because of the family leave law, I was able to take\r\ntime off to spend with her, the most important I ever spent in my life,\r\nwithout losing my job and hurting the rest of my family. It means more to\r\nme than I will ever be able to say. Don't you people up here ever think\r\nwhat you do doesn't make a difference. It does.\"\r\n\r\nThough we are making a difference, our work has just begun. Many Americans\r\nstill haven't felt the impact of what we've done. The recovery still hasn't\r\ntouched every community or created enough jobs. Incomes are still stagnant.\r\nThere's still too much violence and not enough hope in too many places.\r\n\r\nAbroad, the young democracies we are strongly supporting still face very\r\ndifficult times and look to us for leadership.\r\n\r\nAnd so tonight, let us resolve to continue the journey of renewal, to\r\ncreate more and better jobs, to guarantee health security for all, to\r\nreward welfare--work over welfare, to promote democracy abroad and to\r\nbegin to reclaim our streets from violent crime and drugs and gangs to\r\nrenew our own American community.\r\n\r\nDeficit Reduction\r\n\r\nLast year, we began to put our house in order by tackling the budget\r\ndeficit that was driving us toward bankruptcy. We cut $255 billion in\r\nspending, including entitlements, in over 340 separate budget items. We\r\nfroze domestic spending and used honest budget numbers.\r\n\r\nLed by the vice president, we've launched a campaign to reinvent\r\ngovernment. We've cut staff, cut perks, even trimmed the fleet of federal\r\nlimousines. After years of leaders whose rhetoric attacked bureaucracy but\r\nwhose actions expanded it, we will actually reduce it by 252,000 people\r\nover the next five years. By the time we have finished, the federal\r\nbureaucracy will be at its lowest point in 30 years.\r\n\r\nBecause the deficit was so large and because they benefited from tax cuts\r\nin the 1980s, we did ask the wealthiest Americans to pay more to reduce the\r\ndeficit. So on April the 15th, the American people will discover the truth\r\nabout what we did last year on taxes. Only the top one--the top 1.2\r\npercent of Americans, as I said all along, will face higher income tax\r\nrates--let me repeat, only the wealthiest 1.2 percent of Americans will\r\nface higher income tax rates and no one else will, and that is the truth.\r\nOf course, there were, as there always are in politics, naysayers who said\r\nthis plan wouldn't work, but they were wrong. When I became president, the\r\nexperts predicted that next year's deficit would be $300 billion, but\r\nbecause we acted, those same people now say the deficit's going to be under\r\n$180 billion, 40 percent lower than was previously predicted.\r\n\r\nThe Economy\r\n\r\nOur economic program has helped to produce the lowest core inflation rate\r\nand the lowest interest rates in 20 years, and because those interest rates\r\nare down, business investment and equipment is growing at seven times the\r\nrate of the previous four years. Auto sales are way up, home sales at a\r\nrecord high. Millions of Americans have refinanced their homes and our\r\neconomy has produced 1.6 million private-sector jobs in 1993, more than\r\nwere created in the previous four years combined.\r\n\r\nThe people who supported this economic plan should be proud of its early\r\nresults--proud. But everyone in this chamber should know and acknowledge\r\nthat there is more to do. Next month I will send you one of the toughest\r\nbudgets ever presented to Congress. It will cut spending in more than 300\r\nprograms, eliminate 100 domestic programs, and reforms the way in which\r\ngovernments buy goods and services.\r\n\r\nThis year we must again make the hard choices to live within the hard\r\nspending ceilings we have set. We must do it. We have proved we can bring\r\nthe deficit down without choking off recovery, without punishing seniors or\r\nthe middle class, and without putting our national security at risk. If you\r\nwill stick with this plan, we will post three consecutive years of\r\ndeclining deficits for the first time since Harry Truman lived in the White\r\nHouse. And once again, the buck stops here.\r\n\r\nTrade\r\n\r\nOur economic plan also bolsters our strength and our credibility around the\r\nworld. Once we reduced the deficit and put the steel back into our\r\ncompetitive edge, the world echoed with the sound of falling trade\r\nbarriers. In one year, with NAFTA, with GATT, with our efforts in Asia and\r\nthe national export strategy, we did more to open world markets to American\r\nproducts than at any time in the last two generations. That means more jobs\r\nand rising living standards for the American people, low deficits, low\r\ninflation, low interest rates, low trade barriers and high investments.\r\nThese are the building blocks of our recovery. But if we want to take full\r\nadvantage of the opportunities before us in the global economy, you all\r\nknow we must do more.\r\n\r\nAs we reduce defense spending, I ask Congress to invest more in the\r\ntechnologies of tomorrow. Defense conversion will keep us strong militarily\r\nand create jobs for our people here at home.\r\n\r\nAs we protect our environment, we must invest in the environmental\r\ntechnologies of the future which will create jobs. This year we will fight\r\nfor a revitalized Clean Water Act and a Safe Drinking Water Act and a\r\nreformed Superfund program.\r\n\r\nAnd the vice president is right; we must also work with the private sector\r\nto connect every classroom, every clinic, every library, every hospital in\r\nAmerica into a national information superhighway by the year 2000. Think of\r\nit. Instant access to information will increase productivity. It will help\r\nto educate our children. It will provide better medical care. It will\r\ncreate jobs. And I call on the Congress to pass legislation to establish\r\nthat information superhighway this year.\r\n\r\nAs we expand opportunity and create jobs, no one can be left out. We must\r\ncontinue to enforce fair lending and fair housing and all civil rights\r\nlaws, because America will never be complete in its renewal until everyone\r\nshares in its bounty. But we all know, too, we can do all these things--\r\nput our economic house in order, expand world trade, target the jobs of the\r\nfuture, guarantee equal opportunity.\r\n\r\nBut if we're honest, we'll all admit that this strategy still cannot work\r\nunless we also give our people the education, training and skills they need\r\nto seize the opportunities of tomorrow. We must set tough, world-class\r\nacademic and occupational standards for all our children and give our\r\nteachers and students the tools they need to meet them.\r\n\r\nEducation\r\n\r\nOur Goals 2000 proposal will empower individual school districts to\r\nexperiment with ideas like chartering their schools to be run by private\r\ncorporations or having more public school choice, to do whatever they wish\r\nto do as long as we measure every school by one high standard: Are our\r\nchildren learning what they need to know to compete and win in the global\r\neconomy?\r\n\r\nGoals 2000 links world-class standards to grassroots reforms and I hope\r\nCongress will pass it without delay. Our school to work initiative will for\r\nthe first time link school to the world of work, providing at least one\r\nyear of apprenticeship beyond high school. After all, most of the people\r\nwe're counting on to build our economic future won't graduate from college.\r\nIt's time to stop ignoring them and start empowering them. We must\r\nliterally transform our outdated unemployment system into a new\r\nreemployment system. The old unemployment system just sort of kept you\r\ngoing while you waited for your old job to come back. We've got to have a\r\nnew system to move people into new and better jobs because most of those\r\nold jobs just don't come back. And we know that the only way to have real\r\njob security in the future, to get a good job with a growing income, is to\r\nhave real skills and the ability to learn new ones. So we've got to\r\nstreamline today's patchwork of training programs and make them a source of\r\nnew skill for our people who lose their jobs. Reemployment, not\r\nunemployment, must become the centerpiece of our economic renewal. I urge\r\nyou to pass it in this session of Congress.\r\n\r\nWelfare\r\n\r\nAnd just as we must transform our unemployment system, so must we also\r\nrevolutionize our welfare system. It doesn't work; it defies our values as\r\na nation. If we value work, we can't justify a system that makes welfare\r\nmore attractive than work if people are worried about losing their health\r\ncare.\r\n\r\nIf we value responsibility, we can't ignore the $34 billion in child\r\nsupport absent parents out to be paying to millions of parents who are\r\ntaking care of their children--. If we value strong families, we can't\r\nperpetuate a system that actually penalizes those who stay together. Can\r\nyou believe that a child who has a child gets more money from the\r\ngovernment for leaving home than for staying home with a parent or a\r\ngrandparent? That's not just bad policy, it's wrong and we ought to change\r\nit.\r\n\r\nI worked on this problem for years before I became president, with other\r\ngovernors and with members of Congress in both parties and with the\r\nprevious administration of another party. I worked on it with people who\r\nwere on welfare, lots of them. And I want to say something to everybody\r\nhere who cares about this issue. The people who most want to change this\r\nsystem are the people who are dependent on it. They want to get off\r\nwelfare; they want to go back to work; they want to do right by their\r\nkids.\r\n\r\nI once had a hearing when I was a governor and I brought in people on\r\nwelfare from all over America who had found their way to work and a woman\r\nfrom my state who testified was asked this question. What's the best thing\r\nabout being off welfare and in a job. And without blinking an eye, she\r\nlooked at 40 governors and she said, when my boy goes to school and they\r\nsay \"What does your mother do for a living?\" he can give an answer. These\r\npeople want a better system and we ought to give it to them.\r\n\r\nLast year, we began this. We gave the states more power to innovate because\r\nwe know that a lot of great ideas come from outside Washington and many\r\nstates are already using it. Then this Congress took a dramatic step.\r\nInstead of taxing people with modest incomes into poverty, we helped them\r\nto work their way out of poverty by dramatically increasing the earned\r\nincome tax credit. It will lift 15 million working families out of poverty,\r\nrewarding work over welfare, making it possible for people to be successful\r\nworkers and successful parents. Now that's real welfare reform.\r\n\r\nBut there is more to be done. This spring I will send you a comprehensive\r\nwelfare reform bill that builds on the Family Support Act of 1988 and\r\nrestores the basic values of work and responsibility. We will say to\r\nteenagers if you have a child out of wedlock, we'll no longer give you a\r\ncheck to set up a separate household, we want families to stay together;\r\nsay to absent parents who aren't paying their child support if you're not\r\nproviding for your children we'll garnish your wages, suspend your license,\r\ntrack you across state lines, and if necessary make some of you work off\r\nwhat you owe.\r\n\r\nPeople who bring children into this world cannot and must not walk away\r\nfrom them.\r\n\r\nBut to all those who depend on welfare, we should offer ultimately a simple\r\ncompact. We will provide the support, the job training, the child care you\r\nneed for up to two years, but after that anyone who can work, must, in the\r\nprivate sector wherever possible, in community service if necessary. That's\r\nthe only way we'll ever make welfare what it ought to be, a second chance,\r\nnot a way of life.\r\n\r\nI know it will be difficult to tackle welfare reform in 1994 at the same\r\ntime we tackle health care. But let me point out, I think it is inevitable\r\nand imperative. It is estimated that one million people are on welfare\r\ntoday because it's the only way they can get health care coverage for their\r\nchildren. Those who choose to leave welfare for jobs without health\r\nbenefits, and many entry level jobs don't have health benefits, find\r\nthemselves in the incredible position of paying taxes that help to pay for\r\nhealth care coverage for those who made the other choice, to stay on\r\nwelfare. No wonder people leave work and go back to welfare, to get health\r\ncare coverage. We've got to solve the health care problem to have real\r\nwelfare reform.\r\n\r\nHealth Care Reform\r\n\r\nSo this year we will make history by reforming the health care system. And\r\nI would say to you, all of you my fellow public servants, this is another\r\nissue where the people are way ahead of the politicians.\r\n\r\nThat may not be popular with either party, but it happens to be the truth.\r\n\r\nYou know, the first lady has received now almost a million letters from\r\npeople all across America and from all walks of life. I'd like to share\r\njust one of them with you. Richard Anderson of Reno, Nevada, lost his job\r\nand, with it, his health insurance. Two weeks later, his wife, Judy,\r\nsuffered a cerebral aneurysm. He rushed her to the hospital, where she\r\nstayed in intensive care for 21 days. The Anderson's bills were over\r\n$120,000. Although Judy recovered and Richard went back to work at $8 an\r\nhour, the bills were too much for them and they were literally forced into\r\nbankruptcy.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Clinton,\" he wrote to Hillary, \"no one in the United States of\r\nAmerica should have to lose everything they've worked for all their lives\r\nbecause they were unfortunate enough to become ill.\" It was to help the\r\nRichard and Judy Andersons of America that the first lady and so many\r\nothers have worked so hard and so long on this health care reform issue. We\r\nowe them our thanks and our action.\r\n\r\nI know there are people here who say there's no health care crisis. Tell it\r\nto Richard and Judy Anderson. Tell it to the 58 million Americans who have\r\nno coverage at all for some time each year. Tell it to the 81 million\r\nAmericans with those preexisting conditions; those folks are paying more or\r\nthey can't get insurance at all or they can't ever change their jobs\r\nbecause they or someone in their family has one of those preexisting\r\nconditions. Tell it to the small businesses burdened by skyrocketing costs\r\nof insurance. Most small businesses cover their employers, and they pay on\r\naverage 35 percent more in premiums than big businesses or government. Or\r\ntell it to the 76 percent of insured Americans, three out of four whose\r\npolicies have lifetime limits, and that means they can find themselves\r\nwithout any coverage at all just when they need it the most.\r\n\r\nSo, if any of you believe there's no crisis, you tell it to those people,\r\nbecause I can't.\r\n\r\nThere are some people who literally do not understand the impact of this\r\nproblem on people's lives, but all you have to do is go out and listen to\r\nthem. Just go talk to them anywhere, in any congressional district in this\r\ncountry. They're Republicans and Democrats and independents. It doesn't\r\nhave a lick to do with party. They think we don't get it, and it's time we\r\nshow that we do get it.\r\n\r\nFrom the day we began, our health care initiative has been designed to\r\nstrengthen what is good about our health care system--the world's best\r\nhealth care professionals, cutting edge research, and wonderful research\r\ninstitutions, Medicare for older Americans. None of this--none of it\r\nshould be put at risk. But we're paying more and more money for less and\r\nless care. Every year, fewer and fewer Americans even get to choose their\r\ndoctors. Every year, doctors and nurses spend more time on paperwork and\r\nless time with patients because of the absolute bureaucratic nightmare the\r\npresent system has become.\r\n\r\nThis system is riddled with inefficiency, with abuse, with fraud, and\r\neverybody knows it. In today's health care system, insurance companies call\r\nthe shots. They pick whom they cover and how they cover them. They can cut\r\noff your benefits when you need your coverage the most. They are in\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\nWhat does it mean? It means every night millions of well-insured Americans\r\ngo to bed just an illness, an accident, or a pink slip away from having no\r\ncoverage or financial ruin. It means every morning millions of Americans go\r\nto work without any health insurance at all--something the workers in no\r\nother advanced country in the world do. It means that every year more and\r\nmore hard working people are told to pick a new doctor because their boss\r\nhas had to pick a new plan. And countless others turndown better jobs\r\nbecause they know, if they take the better job, they'll lose their health\r\ninsurance.\r\n\r\nIf we just let the health care system continue to drift, our country will\r\nhave people with less care, fewer choices, and higher bill.\r\n\r\nNow, our approach protects the quality of care and people's choices. It\r\nbuilds on what works today in the private sector, to expand employer based\r\ncoverage, to guarantee private insurance for every American. And I might\r\nsay, employer based private insurance for every American was proposed 20\r\nyears ago by President Richard Nixon to the United States Congress. It was\r\na good idea then, and it's a better idea today.\r\n\r\nWhy do we want guaranteed private insurance? Because right now, nine out of\r\nten people who have insurance get it through their employers--and that\r\nshould continue. And if your employer is providing good benefits at\r\nreasonable prices, that should continue too. And that ought to make the\r\nCongress and the president feel better. Our goal is health insurance\r\neverybody can depend on--comprehensive benefits that cover preventive care\r\nand prescription drugs, health premiums that don't just explode when you\r\nget sick or you get older, the power--no matter how small your business is\r\n--to choose dependable insurance at the same competitive rates that\r\ngovernments and big business get today, one simple form for people who are\r\nsick, and most of all, the freedom to choose a plan and the right to choose\r\nyour own doctor.\r\n\r\nOur approach protects older Americans. Every plan before the Congress\r\nproposes to slow the growth of Medicare. The difference is this. We believe\r\nthose savings should be used to improve health care for senior citizens.\r\nMedicare must be protected, and it should cover prescription drugs, and we\r\nshould take the first steps in covering long-term care.\r\n\r\nTo those who would cut Medicare without protecting seniors, I say the\r\nsolution to today's squeeze on middle class working people's health care is\r\nnot to put the squeeze on middle class retired people's health care. We can\r\ndo better than that. When it's all said and done, it's pretty simple to me.\r\nInsurance ought to mean what it used to mean. You pay a fair price for\r\nsecurity, and when you get sick, health care is always there--no matter\r\nwhat.\r\n\r\nAlong with the guarantee of health security, we all have to admit, too,\r\nthere must be more responsibility on the part of all of us in how we use\r\nthis system. People have to take their kids to get immunized. We should all\r\ntake advantage of preventive care. We must all work together to stop the\r\nviolence that explodes our emergency rooms. We have to practice better\r\nhealth habits, and we can't abuse the system. And those who don't have\r\ninsurance under our approach will get coverage, but they will have to pay\r\nsomething for it, too. The minority of businesses that provide no insurance\r\nat all, and in so doing, shift the cost of the care of their employees to\r\nothers, should contribute something. People who smoke should pay more for a\r\npack of cigarettes. Everybody can contribute something if we want to solve\r\nthe health care crisis. There can't be anymore something for nothing. It\r\nwill not be easy, but it can be done. Now in the coming months I hope very\r\nmuch to work with both Democrats and Republicans to reform a health care\r\nsystem by using the market to bring down costs and to achieve lasting\r\nhealth security. But if you look at history, we see that for 60 years this\r\ncountry has tried to reform health care. President Roosevelt tried,\r\nPresident Truman tried, President Nixon tried, President Carter tried.\r\nEvery time the special interests were powerful enough to defeat them, but\r\nnot this time.\r\n\r\nCampaign Finance Reform\r\n\r\nI know that facing up to these interests will require courage. It will\r\nraise critical questions about the way we finance our campaigns and how\r\nlobbyists yield their influence. The work of change, frankly, will never\r\nget any easier until we limit the influence of well financed interests who\r\nprofit from this current system. So I also must now call on you to finish\r\nthe job both houses began last year, by passing tough and meaningful\r\ncampaign finance reform and lobby reform legislation this year.\r\n\r\nYou know, my fellow Americans, this is really a test for all of us. The\r\nAmerican people provide those of us in government service with terrific\r\nhealth care benefits at reasonable costs. We have health care that's always\r\nthere. I think we need to give every hard working, taxpaying American the\r\nsame health care security they have already given to us.\r\n\r\nI want to make this very clear: I am open, as I have said repeatedly, to\r\nthe best ideas of concerned members of both parties. I have no special\r\nbrief for any specific approach, even in our own bill, except this: if you\r\nsend me legislation that does not guarantee every American private health\r\ninsurance that can never be taken away, you will force me to take this pen,\r\nveto the legislation, and we'll come right back here and start all over\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nBut I don't think that's going to happen. I think we're ready to act now. I\r\nbelieve that you're ready to act now. And if you're ready to guarantee\r\nevery American the same health care that you have, health care that can\r\nnever be taken away--now, not next year or the year after, now is the time\r\nto stand with the people who sent us here. Now.\r\n\r\nForeign Policy\r\n\r\nAs we take these steps together to renew our strength at home, we cannot\r\nturn away from our obligations to renew our leadership abroad. This is a\r\npromising moment. Because of the agreements we have reached this year, last\r\nyear, Russia's strategic nuclear missiles soon will no longer be pointed at\r\nthe United States. Nor will we point ours at them.\r\n\r\nInstead of building weapons in space, Russian scientists will help us to\r\nbuild the international space station.\r\n\r\nAnd of course there are still dangers in the world: rampant arms\r\nproliferation, bitter regional conflicts, ethnic and nationalist tensions\r\nin many new democracies, severe environmental degradation the world over,\r\nand fanatics who seek to cripple the world's cities with terror. As the\r\nworld's greatest power, we must therefore maintain our defenses and our\r\nresponsibilities. This year we secured indictments against terrorists and\r\nsanctions against those harbor them. We worked to promote\r\nenvironmentally-sustainable economic growth. We achieved agreements with\r\nUkraine, with Belarus, with Kazakhstan, to eliminate completely their\r\nnuclear arsenals. We are working to achieve a Korean Peninsula free of\r\nnuclear weapons. We will seek early ratification of the treaty to ban\r\nchemical weapons worldwide. And earlier today we joined with over 30\r\nnations to begin negotiations on a comprehensive ban to stop all nuclear\r\ntesting.\r\n\r\nBut nothing--nothing--is more important to our security than our nation's\r\narmed forces. We honor their contributions, including those who are\r\ncarrying out the longest humanitarian airlift in history in Bosnia----\r\nthose who will complete their mission in Somalia this year and their brave\r\ncomrades who gave their lives there. Our forces are the finest military our\r\nnation has ever had, and I have pledged that as long as I am president they\r\nwill remain the best-equipped, the best-trained and the best-prepared\r\nfighting force on the face of the earth.\r\n\r\nDefense\r\n\r\nLast year, I proposed a defense plan that maintains our post-Cold War\r\nsecurity at a lower cost. This year, many people urged me to cut our\r\ndefense spending further to pay for other government programs. I said no.\r\nThe budget I send to Congress draws the line against further defense cuts.\r\nIt protects the readiness and quality of our forces. Ultimately, the best\r\nstrategy is to do that. We must not cut defense further. I hope the\r\nCongress without regard to party will support that position.\r\n\r\nUltimately, the best strategy to ensure our security and to build a durable\r\npeace is to support the advance of democracy elsewhere. Democracies don't\r\nattack each other. They make better trading partners and partners in\r\ndiplomacy. That is why we have supported, you and I, the democratic\r\nreformers in Russia and in the other states of the former Soviet bloc. I\r\napplaud the bipartisan support this Congress provided last year for our\r\ninitiatives to help Russia, Ukraine and the other states through their epic\r\ntransformations.\r\n\r\nOur support of reform must combine patience for the enormity of the task\r\nand vigilance for our fundamental interest and values. We will continue to\r\nurge Russia and the other states to press ahead with economic reforms, and\r\nwe will seek to cooperate with Russia to solve regional problems while\r\ninsisting that, if Russian troops operate in neighboring states, they do so\r\nonly when those states agree to their presence and in strict accord with\r\ninternational standards.\r\n\r\nBut we must also remember as these nations chart their own futures, and\r\nthey must chart their own futures, how much more secure and more prosperous\r\nour own people will be if democratic and market reform succeed all across\r\nthe former communist bloc. Our policy has been to support that move and\r\nthat has been the policy of the Congress. We should continue it.\r\n\r\nEurope\r\n\r\nThat is why I went to Europe earlier this month, to work with our European\r\npartners to help to integrate all the former communist countries into a\r\nEurope that has the possibility of becoming unified for the first time in\r\nits entire history, it's entire history, based on the simple commitments of\r\nall nations in Europe to democracy, to free markets, and to respect for\r\nexisting borders.\r\n\r\nWith our allies, we have created a partnership for peace that invites\r\nstates from the former Soviet bloc and other non-NATO members to work with\r\nNATO in military cooperation. When I met with Central Europe's leaders,\r\nincluding Lech Walesa and Vaclav Havel, men who put their lives on the line\r\nfor freedom, I told them that the security of their region is important to\r\nour country's security.\r\n\r\nThis year, we must also do more to support democratic renewal and human\r\nrights and sustainable development all around the world. We will ask\r\nCongress to ratify the new GATT accord, we will continue standing by South\r\nAfrica as it works its way through its bold and hopeful and difficult\r\ntransition to democracy. We will convene a summit of the Western\r\nhemisphere's democratic leaders from Canada to the tip of South America.\r\nAnd we will continue to press for the restoration of true democracy in\r\nHaiti.\r\n\r\nAnd as we build a more constructive relationship with China, we must\r\ncontinue to insist on clear signs of improvement in that nation's human\r\nrights record.\r\n\r\nMiddle East\r\n\r\nWe will also work for new progress toward the Middle East peace. Last year\r\nthe world watched Yitzhak Rabin and Yasir Arafat at the White House when\r\nthey had their historic handshake of reconciliation. But there is a long,\r\nhard road ahead. And on that road I am determined that I and our\r\nadministration will do all we can to achieve a comprehensive and lasting\r\npeace for all the peoples of the region.\r\n\r\nNow, there are some in our country who argue that with the Cold War,\r\nAmerica should turn its back on the rest of the world. Many around the\r\nworld were afraid we would do just that. But I took this office on a pledge\r\nthat had no partisan tinge to keep our nation secure by remaining engaged\r\nin the rest of the world. And this year, because of our work together,\r\nenacting NAFTA, keeping our military strong and prepared, supporting\r\ndemocracy abroad, we have reaffirmed America's leadership, America's\r\nengagement, and as a result, the American people are more secure than they\r\nwere before.\r\n\r\nCrime\r\n\r\nBut while Americans are more secure from threats abroad, I think we all now\r\nthat in many ways we are less secure from threats here at home. Everyday\r\nthe national peace is shattered by crime.\r\n\r\nIn Petaluma, California, an innocent slumber party gives way to agonizing\r\ntragedy for the family of Polly Klaas. An ordinary train ride on Long\r\nIsland ends in a hail of nine millimeter rounds. A tourist in Florida is\r\nnearly burned alive by bigots simply because he is black. Right here in our\r\nnation's capital, a brave young man named Jason White, a policeman, the son\r\nand grandson of policemen, is ruthlessly gunned down.\r\n\r\nViolent crime and the fear it provokes are crippling our society, limiting\r\npersonal freedom, and fraying the ties that bind us.\r\n\r\nThe crime bill before Congress gives you a chance to do something about it,\r\na chance to be tough and smart. What does that mean? Let me begin by saying\r\nI care a lot about this issue. Many years ago, when I started out in public\r\nlife, I was the attorney general of my state. I served as a governor for a\r\ndozen years. I know what it's like to sign laws increasing penalties, to\r\nbuild more prison cells, to carry out the death penalty. I understand this\r\nissue and it is not a simple thing.\r\n\r\nFirst, we must recognize that most violent crimes are committed by a small\r\npercentage of criminals who too often break the laws even when they are on\r\nparole. Now those who commit crimes should be punished, and those who\r\ncommit repeated violent crimes should be told when you commit a third\r\nviolent crime, you will be put away and put away for good, three strikes\r\nand you are out.\r\n\r\nSecond, we must take serious steps to reduce violence and prevent crime,\r\nbeginning with more police officers and more community policing. We know\r\nright now that police who work the streets, know the folks, have the\r\nrespect of the neighborhood kids, focus on high crime areas, we know that\r\nthey are more likely to prevent crime as well as catch criminals. Look at\r\nthe experience of Houston, where the crime rate dropped 17 percent in one\r\nyear when that approach was taken. Here tonight is one of those community\r\npolicemen, a brave, young detective, Kevin Jett, whose beat is eight square\r\nblocks in one of the toughest neighborhoods in New York. Every day he\r\nrestores some sanity and safety, and a sense of values and connection to\r\nthe people whose lives he protects. I'd like to ask him to stand up and be\r\nrecognized tonight.\r\n\r\nYou will be given a chance to give the children of this country, the law\r\nabiding working people of this country, and don't forget, in the toughest\r\nneighborhoods in this country, in the highest crime neighborhoods in this\r\ncountry the vast majority of people get up every day and obey the law, pay\r\ntheir taxes, do their best to raise their kids. They deserve people like\r\nKevin Jett, and you're going to be given the chance to give the American\r\npeople another 100,000 of them, well trained, and I urge you to do it.\r\n\r\nYou have before you crime legislation which also establishes a police corps\r\nto encourage young people to get an education, and pay it off by serving as\r\npolice officers, which encourages retiring military personnel to move into\r\npolice forces--and enormous resources for our country, one which has a\r\nsafe schools provisions which will give our young people the chance to walk\r\nto school in safety and to be in school in safety instead of dodging\r\nbullets. These are important things.\r\n\r\nThe third thing we have to do is to build on the Brady Bill--the Brady Law\r\nto take further steps----to take further steps to keep guns out of the\r\nhands of criminals.\r\n\r\nNow, I want to say something about this issue. Hunters must always be free\r\nto hunt, law abiding adults should always be free to own guns and protect\r\ntheir homes. I respect that part of our culture. I grew up in it. But I\r\nwant to ask the sportsmen and others who lawfully own guns to join us in\r\nthis campaign to reduce gun violence. I say to you, I know you didn't\r\ncreate this problem, but we need your help to solve it. There is no\r\nsporting purpose on earth that should stop the United States Congress from\r\nbanishing assault weapons that outgun police and cut down children.\r\n\r\nFourth, we must remember that drugs are a factor in an enormous percentage\r\nof crimes. Recent studies indicate, sadly, that drug use is on the rise\r\nagain among our young people. The Crime Bill contains--all the crime bills\r\ncontain--more money for drug treatment, for criminal addicts, and boot\r\ncamps for youthful offenders that include incentives to get off drugs and\r\nto stay off drugs. Our administration's budget, with all its cuts, contains\r\na large increase in funding for drug treatment and drug education. You must\r\npass them both. We need then desperately.\r\n\r\nMy fellow Americans, the problem of violence is an un-American problem. It\r\nhas no partisan or philosophical element. Therefore, I urge you find ways\r\nas quickly as possible to set aside partisan differences and pass a strong,\r\nsmart, tough crime bill.\r\n\r\nBut further, I urge you to consider this: As you demand tougher penalties\r\nfor those who choose violence, let us also remember how we came to this sad\r\npoint. In our toughest neighborhoods, on our meanest streets, in our\r\npoorest rural areas, we have seen a stunning and simultaneous breakdown of\r\ncommunity, family, and work, the heart and soul of civilized society. This\r\nhas created a vast vacuum which has been filled by violence and drugs and\r\ngangs. So I ask you to remember that even as we say no to crime, we must\r\ngive people, especially our young people something to say yes to. Many of\r\nour initiatives, from job training to welfare reform to health care to\r\nnational service will help to rebuild distressed communities, to strengthen\r\nfamilies, to provide work, but more needs to be done. That's what our\r\ncommunity empowerment agenda is all about--challenging businesses to\r\nprovide more investment through empowerment zones, ensuring banks will make\r\nloans in the same communities their deposits come from, passing legislation\r\nto unleash the power of capital through community development banks to\r\ncreate jobs, opportunity, and hope where they're needed most.\r\n\r\nBut I think you know that to really solve this problem, we'll all have to\r\nput our heads together, leave our ideological armor aside, and find some\r\nnew ideas to do even more.\r\n\r\nThe Role Of Government\r\n\r\nAnd let's be honest, we all know something else, too. Our problems go way\r\nbeyond the reach of government. They're rooted in the loss of values and\r\nthe disappearance of work and the breakdown of our families and our\r\ncommunities. My fellow Americans, we can cut the deficit, create jobs,\r\npromote democracy around the world, pass welfare reform and health care,\r\npass the toughest crime bill in history and still leave too many of our\r\npeople behind.\r\n\r\nThe American people have got to want to change from within if we're going\r\nto bring back work and family and community. We cannot renew our country\r\nwhen, within a decade, more than half of the children will be born into\r\nfamilies where there has been no marriage. We cannot renew this country\r\nwhen 13-year-old boys get semi-automatic weapons to shoot 9 year olds for\r\nkicks. We can't renew our country when children are having children and the\r\nfathers walk away as if the kids don't amount to anything. We can't renew\r\nthe country when our businesses eagerly look for new investments and new\r\ncustomers abroad but ignore those people right here at home who'd give\r\nanything to have their jobs and would gladly buy their products if they had\r\nthe money to do it.\r\n\r\nWe can't renew our country unless more of us--I mean all of us--are\r\nwilling to join the churches and the other good citizens, people like all\r\nthe black ministers I've worked with over the years or the priests and the\r\nnuns I met at Our Lady of Help in East Los Angeles or my good friend Tony\r\nCampolo in Philadelphia, unless we're willing to work with people like\r\nthat, people who are saving kids, adopting schools, making streets safer.\r\nAll of us can do that.\r\n\r\nWe can't renew our country until we realize that governments don't raise\r\nchildren; parents do. Parents who know their children's teachers and turn\r\noff the television and help with the homework and teach their kids right\r\nfrom wrong--those kind of parents can make all the difference. I know. I\r\nhad one. And I'm telling you we have got to stop pointing our fingers at\r\nthese kids who have no future and reach our hands out to them. Our country\r\nneeds it. We need it. And they deserve it.\r\n\r\nAnd so I say to you tonight let's give our children a future. Let us take\r\naway their guns and give them books. Let us overcome their despair and\r\nreplace it with hope. Let us, by our example, teach them to obey the law,\r\nrespect our neighbors, and cherish our values. Let us weave these sturdy\r\nthreads into a new American community that once more stand strong against\r\nthe forces of despair and evil because everybody has a chance to walk into\r\na better tomorrow.\r\n\r\nOh, there will be naysayers who fear that we won't be equal to the\r\nchallenges of this time, but they misread our history, our heritage, even\r\ntoday's headlines. All those things tell us we can and we will overcome any\r\nchallenge.\r\n\r\nWhen the earth shook and fires raged in California; when I saw the\r\nMississippi deluge the farmlands of the Midwest in a 500 year flood; when\r\nthe century's bitterest cold swept from North Dakota to Newport News it\r\nseemed as though the world itself was coming apart at the seams. But the\r\nAmerican people, they just came together. They rose to the occasion,\r\nneighbor helping neighbor, strangers risking life and limb to stay total\r\nstrangers, showing the better angels of our nature.\r\n\r\nLet us not reserve the better angels only for natural disasters, leaving\r\nour deepest and most profound problems to petty political fighting.\r\n\r\nLet us instead by true to our spirit, facing facts, coming together,\r\nbringing hope and moving forward.\r\n\r\nTonight, my fellow Americans, we are summoned to answer a question as old\r\nas the republic itself, what is the state of our union?\r\n\r\nIt is growing stronger but it must be stronger still. With your help and\r\nGod's help it will be.\r\n\r\nThank you and God Bless America.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nWilliam J. Clinton\r\nJanuary 24, 1995\r\n\r\nMr. President, Mr. Speaker, members of the 104th Congress, my fellow\r\nAmericans:\r\n\r\nAgain we are here in the sanctuary of democracy. And once again, our\r\ndemocracy has spoken.\r\n\r\nSo let me begin by congratulating all of you here in the 104th Congress,\r\nand congratulating you, Mr. Speaker.\r\n\r\nIf we agree on nothing else tonight, we must agree that the American people\r\ncertainly voted for change in 1992 and in 1994.\r\n\r\nAnd as I look out at you, I know how some of you must have felt in 1992.\r\n\r\nI must say that in both years we didn't hear America singing, we heard\r\nAmerica shouting. And now all of us, Republicans and Democrats alike, must\r\nsay: We hear you. We will work together to earn the jobs you have given us.\r\nFor we are the keepers of the sacred trust and we must be faithful to it in\r\nthis new and very demanding era.\r\n\r\nOver 200 years ago, our founders changed the entire course of human history\r\nby joining together to create a new country based on a single, powerful\r\nidea. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created\r\nequal, endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights. Among\r\nthese are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\r\n\r\nIt has fallen to every generation since then to preserve that idea--the\r\nAmerican idea--and to deepen and expand its meaning in new and different\r\ntimes. To Lincoln and to his Congress, to preserve the Union and to end\r\nslavery. To Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson, to restrain the abuses\r\nand excesses of the Industrial Revolution and to assert our leadership in\r\nthe world. To Franklin Roosevelt, to fight the failure and pain of the\r\nGreat Depression and to win our country's great struggle against fascism.\r\n\r\nAnd to all our Presidents since, to fight the cold war. Especially, I\r\nrecall two who struggled to fight that cold war in partnership with\r\nCongresses where the majority was of a different party. To Harry Truman,\r\nwho summoned us to unparalleled prosperity at home and who built the\r\narchitecture of the cold war. And to Ronald Reagan, whom we wish well\r\ntonight, and who exhorted us to carry on until the twilight struggle\r\nagainst Communism was won.\r\n\r\nIn another time of change and challenge, I had the honor to be the first\r\nPresident to be elected in the post-cold-war era, an era marked by the\r\nglobal economy, the information revolution, unparalleled change in\r\nopportunity and in security for the American people.\r\n\r\nI came to this hallowed chamber two years ago on a mission: To restore the\r\nAmerican dream for all our people and to make sure that we move into the\r\n21st century still the strongest force for freedom and democracy in the\r\nentire world.\r\n\r\nI was determined then to tackle the tough problems too long ignored. In\r\nthis effort I am frank to say that I have made my mistakes. And I have\r\nlearned again the importance of humility in all human endeavor.\r\n\r\nBut I am also proud to say tonight that our country is stronger than it was\r\ntwo years ago.\r\n\r\nAccomplishments\r\n\r\nRecord numbers, record numbers of Americans are succeeding in the new\r\nglobal economy. We are at peace, and we are a force for peace and freedom\r\nthroughout the world. We have almost six million new jobs since I became\r\nPresident, and we have the lowest combined rate of unemployment and\r\ninflation in 25 years.\r\n\r\nOur businesses are more productive and here we have worked to bring the\r\ndeficit down, to expand trade, to put more police on our streets, to give\r\nour citizens more of the tools they need to get an education and to rebuild\r\ntheir own communities. But the rising tide is not lifting all the boats.\r\n\r\nWhile our nation is enjoying peace and prosperity, too many of our people\r\nare still working harder and harder for less and less. While our businesses\r\nare restructuring and growing more productive and competitive, too many of\r\nour people still can't be sure of having a job next year or even next\r\nmonth. And far more than our material riches are threatened, things far\r\nmore precious to us: our children, our families, our values.\r\n\r\nOur civil life is suffering in America today. Citizens are working together\r\nless and shouting at each other more. The common bonds of community which\r\nhave been the great strength of our country from its very beginning are\r\nbadly frayed.\r\n\r\nWhat are we to do about it?\r\n\r\nMore than 60 years ago at the dawn of another new era, President Roosevelt\r\ntold our nation new conditions impose new requirements on Government and\r\nthose who conduct Government. And from that simple proposition he shaped\r\nthe New Deal, which helped to restore our nation to prosperity and defined\r\nthe relationship between our people and their Government for half a\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThat approach worked in its time but today we face a very different time\r\nand very different conditions. We are moving from an industrial age built\r\non gears and sweat to an information age demanding skills and learning and\r\nflexibility.\r\n\r\nOur Government, once a champion of national purpose, is now seen by many as\r\nsimply a captive of narrow interests putting more burdens on our citizens\r\nrather than equipping them to get ahead. The values that used to hold us\r\nall together seem to be coming apart.\r\n\r\nSo tonight we must forge a new social compact to meet the challenges of\r\nthis time. As we enter a new era, we need a new set of understandings not\r\njust with Government but, even more important, with one another as\r\nAmericans.\r\n\r\nNew Covenant\r\n\r\nThat's what I want to talk with you about tonight. I call it the New\r\nCovenant but it's grounded in a very, very old idea that all Americans have\r\nnot just a right but a solemn responsibility to rise as far as their\r\nGod-given talents and determination can take them. And to give something\r\nback to their communities and their country in return.\r\n\r\nOpportunity and responsibility--they go hand in hand; we can't have one\r\nwithout the other, and our national community can't hold together without\r\nboth.\r\n\r\nOur New Covenant is a new set of understandings for how we can equip our\r\npeople to meet the challenges of the new economy, how we can change the way\r\nour Government works to fit a different time and, above all, how we can\r\nrepair the damaged bonds in our society and come together behind our common\r\npurpose. We must have dramatic change in our economy, our Government and\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\nMy fellow Americans, without regard to party, let us rise to the occasion.\r\nLet us put aside partisanship and pettiness and pride. As we embark on this\r\ncourse, let us put our country first, remembering that regardless of party\r\nlabel we are all Americans. And let the final test of everything we do be a\r\nsimple one: Is it good for the American people?\r\n\r\nLet me begin by saying that we cannot ask Americans to be better citizens\r\nif we are not better servants. You made a good start by passing that law\r\nwhich applies to Congress all the laws you put on the private sector--and\r\nI was proud to sign it yesterday.\r\n\r\nBut we have a lot more to do before people really trust the way things work\r\naround here. Three times as many lobbyists are in the streets and corridors\r\nof Washington as were here 20 years ago. The American people look at their\r\ncapital and they see a city where the well-connected and the well-protected\r\ncan work the system, but the interests of ordinary citizens are often left\r\nout.\r\n\r\nAs the new Congress opened its doors, lobbyists were still doing business\r\nas usual--the gifts, the trips--all the things that people are concerned\r\nabout haven't stopped.\r\n\r\nTwice this month you missed opportunities to stop these practices. I know\r\nthere were other considerations in those votes, but I want to use something\r\nthat I've heard my Republican friends say from time to time: There doesn't\r\nhave to be a law for everything.\r\n\r\nSo tonight I ask you to just stop taking the lobbyists' perks, just stop.\r\n\r\nWe don't have to wait for legislation to pass to send a strong signal to\r\nthe American people that things are really changing. But I also hope you\r\nwill send me the strongest possible lobby reform bill, and I'll sign that,\r\ntoo. We should require lobbyists to tell the people for whom they work what\r\nthey're spending, what they want. We should also curb the role of big money\r\nin elections by capping the cost of campaigns and limiting the influence of\r\nPAC's.\r\n\r\nAnd as I have said for three years, we should work to open the air waves so\r\nthat they can be an instrument of democracy not a weapon of destruction by\r\ngiving free TV time to candidates for public office.\r\n\r\nWhen the last Congress killed political reform last year, it was reported\r\nin the press that the lobbyists actually stood in the halls of this sacred\r\nbuilding and cheered. This year, let's give the folks at home something to\r\ncheer about.\r\n\r\nMore important, I think we all agree that we have to change the way the\r\nGovernment works. Let's make it smaller, less costly and smarter. Leaner\r\nnot meaner.\r\n\r\nI just told the Speaker the equal time doctrine's alive and well.\r\n\r\nThe Role Of Government\r\n\r\nThe New Covenant approach to governing is as different from the old\r\nbureaucratic way as the computer is from the manual typewriter. The old way\r\nof governing around here protected organized interests; we should look out\r\nfor the interests of ordinary people. The old way divided us by interests,\r\nconstituency or class; the New Covenant way should unite us behind a common\r\nvision of what's best for our country.\r\n\r\nThe old way dispensed services through large, top-down, inflexible\r\nbureaucracies. The New Covenant way should shift these resources and\r\ndecision making from bureaucrats to citizens, injecting choice and\r\ncompetition and individual responsibility into national policy.\r\n\r\nThe old way of governing around here actually seemed to reward failure. The\r\nNew Covenant way should have built-in incentives to reward success.\r\n\r\nThe old way was centralized here in Washington. The New Covenant way must\r\ntake hold in the communities all across America, and we should help them to\r\ndo that.\r\n\r\nOur job here is to expand opportunity, not bureaucracy, to empower people\r\nto make the most of their own lives and to enhance our security here at\r\nhome and abroad.\r\n\r\nWe must not ask Government to do what we should do for ourselves. We should\r\nrely on Government as a partner to help us to do more for ourselves and for\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nI hope very much that as we debate these specific and exciting matters, we\r\ncan go beyond the sterile discussion between the illusion that there is\r\nsomehow a program for every problem, on the one hand, and the other\r\nillusion that the Government is the source of every problem that we have.\r\n\r\nOur job is to get rid of yesterday's Government so that our own people can\r\nmeet today's and tomorrow's needs.\r\n\r\nAnd we ought to do it together.\r\n\r\nYou know, for years before I became President, I heard others say they\r\nwould cut Government and how bad it was. But not much happened.\r\n\r\nWe actually did it. We cut over a quarter of a trillion dollars in\r\nspending, more than 300 domestic programs, more than 100,000 positions from\r\nthe Federal bureaucracy in the last two years alone.\r\n\r\nBased on decisions already made, we will have cut a total of more than a\r\nquarter of a million positions from the Federal Government, making it the\r\nsmallest it has been since John Kennedy was president, by the time I come\r\nhere again next year.\r\n\r\nUnder the leadership of Vice President Gore, our initiatives have already\r\nsaved taxpayers $ 63 billion. The age of the $ 500 hammer and the ashtray\r\nyou can break on David Letterman is gone. Deadwood programs like mohair\r\nsubsidies are gone. We've streamlined the Agriculture Department by\r\nreducing it by more than 1,200 offices. We've slashed the small-business\r\nloan form from an inch thick to a single page. We've thrown away the\r\nGovernment's 10,000-page personnel manual.\r\n\r\nAnd the Government is working better in important ways. FEMA, the Federal\r\nEmergency Management Agency, has gone from being a disaster to helping\r\npeople in disaster.\r\n\r\nYou can ask the farmers in the Middle West who fought the flood there or\r\nthe people in California who've dealt with floods and earthquakes and fires\r\nand they'll tell you that.\r\n\r\nGovernment workers, working hand-in-hand with private business, rebuilt\r\nSouthern California's fractured freeways in record time and under budget.\r\n\r\nAnd because the Federal Government moved fast, all but one of the 5,600\r\nschools damaged in the earthquake are back in business.\r\n\r\nNow, there are a lot of other things that I could talk about. I want to\r\njust mention one because it'll be discussed here in the next few weeks.\r\n\r\nUniversity administrators all over the country have told me that they are\r\nsaving weeks and weeks of bureaucratic time now because of our direct\r\ncollege loan program, which makes college loans cheaper and more affordable\r\nwith better repayment terms for students, costs the Government less and\r\ncuts out paperwork and bureaucracy for the Government and for the\r\nuniversities.\r\n\r\nWe shouldn't cap that program, we should give every college in America the\r\nopportunity to be a part of it.\r\n\r\nPrevious Government programs gather dust; the reinventing Government report\r\nis getting results. And we're not through--there's going to be a second\r\nround of reinventing Government.\r\n\r\nWe propose to cut $ 130 billion in spending by shrinking departments,\r\nextending our freeze on domestic spending, cutting 60 public housing\r\nprograms down to 3, getting rid of over a hundred programs we do not need\r\nlike the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Helium Reserve Program.\r\n\r\nAnd we're working on getting rid of unnecessary regulations and making them\r\nmore sensible. The programs and regulations that have outlived their\r\nusefulness should go. We have to cut yesterday's Government to help solve\r\ntomorrow's problems.\r\n\r\nAnd we need to get Government closer to the people it's meant to serve. We\r\nneed to help move programs down to the point where states and communities\r\nand private citizens in the private sector can do a better job. If they can\r\ndo it, we ought to let them do it. We should get out of the way and let\r\nthem do what they can do better.\r\n\r\nCommunity Empowerment\r\n\r\nTaking power away from Federal bureaucracies and giving it back to\r\ncommunities and individuals is something everyone should be able to be for.\r\nIt's time for Congress to stop passing onto the states the cost of\r\ndecisions we make here in Washington.\r\n\r\nI know there are still serious differences over the details of the unfunded\r\nmandates legislation but I want to work with you to make sure we pass a\r\nreasonable bill which will protect the national interest and give justified\r\nrelief where we need to give it.\r\n\r\nFor years, Congress concealed in the budget scores of pet spending\r\nprojects. Last year was no different. There was a million dollars to study\r\nstress in plants and $ 12 million for a tick removal program that didn't\r\nwork. It's hard to remove ticks; those of us who've had them know.\r\n\r\nBut I'll tell you something, if you'll give me the line-item veto, I'll\r\nremove some of that unnecessary spending.\r\n\r\nBut, I think we should all remember, and almost all of us would agree, that\r\nGovernment still has important responsibilities.\r\n\r\nOur young people--we should think of this when we cut--our young people\r\nhold our future in their hands. We still owe a debt to our veterans. And\r\nour senior citizens have made us what we are.\r\n\r\nBudget\r\n\r\nNow, my budget cuts a lot. But it protects education, veterans, Social\r\nSecurity and Medicare, and I hope you will do the same thing. You should,\r\nand I hope you will.\r\n\r\nAnd when we give more flexibility to the states, let us remember that there\r\nare certain fundamental national needs that should be addressed in every\r\nstate, north and south, east and west.\r\n\r\nImmunization against childhood disease, school lunches in all our schools,\r\nHead Start, medical care and nutrition for pregnant women and infants--all\r\nthese things are in the national interest.\r\n\r\nI applaud your desire to get rid of costly and unnecessary regulations, but\r\nwhen we deregulate let's remember what national action in the national\r\ninterest has given us: safer food for our families, safer toys for our\r\nchildren, safer nursing homes for our parents, safer cars and highways and\r\nsafer workplaces, cleaner air and cleaner water. Do we need common sense\r\nand fairness in our regulations? You bet we do. But we can have common\r\nsense and still provide for safe drinking water. We can have fairness and\r\nstill clean up toxic dumps and we ought to do it.\r\n\r\nShould we cut the deficit more? Well of course we should. Of course we\r\nshould. But we can bring it down in a way that still protects our economic\r\nrecovery and does not unduly punish people who should not be punished, but\r\ninstead should be helped.\r\n\r\nI know many of you in this chamber support the balanced-budget amendment. I\r\ncertainly want to balance the budget. Our Administration has done more to\r\nbring the budget down and to save money than any in a very, very long\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nIf you believe passing this amendment is the right thing to do, then you\r\nhave to be straight with the American people. They have a right to know\r\nwhat you're going to cut, what taxes you're going to raise, how it's going\r\nto affect them.\r\n\r\nAnd we should be doing things in the open around here. For example,\r\neverybody ought to know if this proposal is going to endanger Social\r\nSecurity. I would oppose that, and I think most Americans would.\r\n\r\nWelfare\r\n\r\nNothing is done more to undermine our sense of common responsibility than\r\nour failed welfare system. This is one of the problems we have to face here\r\nin Washington in our New Covenant. It rewards welfare over work, it\r\nundermines family values, it lets millions of parents get away without\r\npaying their child support, it keeps a minority--but a significant\r\nminority--of the people on welfare trapped on it for a very long time.\r\n\r\nI worked on this problem for a long time--nearly 15 years now. As a\r\nGovernor I had the honor of working with the Reagan Administration to write\r\nthe last welfare reform bill back in 1988.\r\n\r\nIn the last two years we made a good start in continuing the work of\r\nwelfare reform. Our Administration gave two dozen states the right to slash\r\nthrough Federal rules and regulations to reform their own welfare systems\r\nand to try to promote work and responsibility over welfare and dependency.\r\n\r\nLast year, I introduced the most sweeping welfare reform plan ever\r\npresented by an Administration. We have to make welfare what it was meant\r\nto be--a second chance, not a way of life.\r\n\r\nWe have to help those on welfare move to work as quickly as possible, to\r\nprovide child care and teach them skills, if that's what they need, for up\r\nto two years. But after that, there ought to be a simple, hard rule. Anyone\r\nwho can work must go to work.\r\n\r\nIf a parent isn't paying child support, they should be forced to pay.\r\n\r\nWe should suspend driver's licenses, track them across state lines, make\r\nthem work off what they owe. That is what we should do. Governments do not\r\nraise children, people do. And the parents must take responsibility for the\r\nchildren they bring into this world.\r\n\r\nI want to work with you, with all of you, to pass welfare reform. But our\r\ngoal must be to liberate people and lift them from dependence to\r\nindependence, from welfare to work, from mere childbearing to responsible\r\nparenting. Our goal should not be to punish them because they happen to be\r\npoor.\r\n\r\nWe should--we should require work and mutual responsibility. But we\r\nshouldn't cut people off just because they're poor, they're young or even\r\nbecause they're unmarried. We should promote responsibility by requiring\r\nyoung mothers to live at home with their parents or in other supervised\r\nsettings, by requiring them to finish school. But we shouldn't put them and\r\ntheir children out on the street.\r\n\r\nAnd I know all the arguments pro and con and I have read and thought about\r\nthis for a long time: I still don't think we can, in good conscience,\r\npunish poor children for the mistakes of their parents.\r\n\r\nMy fellow Americans, every single survey shows that all the American people\r\ncare about this, without regard to party or race or region. So let this be\r\nthe year we end welfare as we know it.\r\n\r\nBut also let this be the year that we are all able to stop using this issue\r\nto divide America.\r\n\r\nNo one is more eager to end welfare.\r\n\r\nI may be the only President who's actually had the opportunity to sit in\r\nthe welfare office, who's actually spent hours and hours talking to people\r\non welfare, and I am telling you the people who are trapped on it know it\r\ndoesn't work. They also want to get off.\r\n\r\nSo we can promote, together, education and work and good parenting. I have\r\nno problem with punishing bad behavior or the refusal to be a worker or a\r\nstudent or a responsible parent. I just don't want to punish poverty and\r\npast mistakes. All of us have made our mistakes and none of us can change\r\nour yesterdays, but every one of us can change our tomorrows.\r\n\r\nAnd America's best example of that may be Lynn Woolsey, who worked her way\r\noff welfare to become a Congresswoman from the state of California.\r\n\r\nCrime\r\n\r\nI know the members of this Congress are concerned about crime, as are all\r\nthe citizens of our country. But I remind you that last year we passed a\r\nvery tough crime bill--longer sentences, three strikes and you're out,\r\nalmost 60 new capital punishment offenses, more prisons, more prevention,\r\n100,000 more police--and we paid for it all by reducing the size of the\r\nFederal bureaucracy and giving the money back to local communities to lower\r\nthe crime rate.\r\n\r\nThere may be other things we can do to be tougher on crime, to be smarter\r\nwith crime, to help to lower that rate first. Well if there are, let's talk\r\nabout them and let's do them. But let's not go back on the things that we\r\ndid last year that we know work--that we know work because the local\r\nlaw-enforcement officers tell us that we did the right thing. Because local\r\ncommunity leaders, who've worked for years and years to lower the crime\r\nrate, tell us that they work.\r\n\r\nLet's look at the experience of our cities and our rural areas where the\r\ncrime rate has gone down and ask the people who did it how they did it and\r\nif what we did last year supports the decline in the crime rate, and I am\r\nconvinced that it does, let us not go back on it, let's stick with it,\r\nimplement it--we've got four more hard years of work to do to do that.\r\n\r\nI don't want to destroy the good atmosphere in the room or in the country\r\ntonight, but I have to mention one issue that divided this body greatly\r\nlast year. The last Congress also passed the Brady bill and in the crime\r\nbill the ban on 19 assault weapons.\r\n\r\nI don't think it's a secret to anybody in this room that several members of\r\nthe last Congress who voted for that aren't here tonight because they voted\r\nfor it. And I know, therefore, that some of you that are here because they\r\nvoted for it are under enormous pressure to repeal it. I just have to tell\r\nyou how I feel about it.\r\n\r\nThe members who voted for that bill and I would never do anything to\r\ninfringe on the right to keep and bear arms to hunt and to engage in other\r\nappropriate sporting activities. I've done it since I was a boy, and I'm\r\ngoing to keep right on doing it until I can't do it anymore.\r\n\r\nBut a lot of people laid down their seats in Congress so that police\r\nofficers and kids wouldn't have to lay down their lives under a hail of\r\nassault-weapon attacks, and I will not let that be repealed. I will not let\r\nit be repealed.\r\n\r\nI'd like to talk about a couple of other issues we have to deal with. I\r\nwant us to cut more spending, but I hope we won't cut Government programs\r\nthat help to prepare us for the new economy, promote responsibility and are\r\norganized from the grass roots up, not by Federal bureaucracy.\r\n\r\nThe very best example of this is the National Service Corps--AmeriCorps.\r\nIt passed with strong bipartisan support and now there are 20,000 Americans\r\n--more than ever served in one year in the Peace Corps--working all over\r\nthis country, helping person to person in local grass-roots volunteer\r\ngroups, solving problems and in the process earning some money for their\r\neducation.\r\n\r\nThis is citizenship at its best. It's good for the AmeriCorps members, but\r\nit's good for the rest of us, too. It's the essence of the New Covenant and\r\nwe shouldn't stop it.\r\n\r\nIllegal Immigration\r\n\r\nAll Americans, not only in the states most heavily affected, but in every\r\nplace in this country are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal\r\naliens entering our country.\r\n\r\nThe jobs they hold might otherwise be held by citizens or legal immigrants.\r\nThe public services they use impose burdens on our taxpayers. That's why\r\nour Administration has moved aggressively to secure our borders more, by\r\nhiring a record number of new border guards, by deporting twice as many\r\ncriminal aliens as ever before, by cracking down on illegal hiring, by\r\nbarring welfare benefits to illegal aliens.\r\n\r\nIn the budget I will present to you, we will try to do more to speed the\r\ndeportation of illegal aliens who are arrested for crimes, to better\r\nidentify illegal aliens in the workplace as recommended by the commission\r\nheaded by former Congresswoman Barbara Jordan.\r\n\r\nWe are a nation of immigrants, but we are also a nation of laws. It is\r\nwrong and ultimately self-defeating for a nation of immigrants to permit\r\nthe kind of abuse of our immigration laws we have seen in recent years, and\r\nwe must do more to stop it.\r\n\r\nThe most important job of our Government in this new era is to empower the\r\nAmerican people to succeed in the global economy. America has always been a\r\nland of opportunity, a land where, if you work hard, you can get ahead.\r\nWe've become a great middle-class country; middle-class values sustain us.\r\nWe must expand that middle class and shrink the underclass even as we do\r\neverything we can to support the millions of Americans who are already\r\nsuccessful in the new economy.\r\n\r\nAmerica is once again the world's strongest economic power: almost six\r\nmillion new jobs in the last two years, exports booming, inflation down,\r\nhigh-wage jobs are coming back. A record number of American entrepreneurs\r\nare living the American dream.\r\n\r\nIf we want it to stay that way, those who work and lift our nation must\r\nhave more of its benefits.\r\n\r\nToday, too many of those people are being left out. They're working harder\r\nfor less. They have less security, less income, less certainty that they\r\ncan even afford a vacation, much less college for their kids or retirement\r\nfor themselves.\r\n\r\nWe cannot let this continue. If we don't act, our economy will probably\r\nkeep doing what it's been doing since about 1978, when the income growth\r\nbegan to go to those at the very top of our economic scale. And the people\r\nin the vast middle got very little growth and people who worked like crazy\r\nbut were on the bottom then, fell even further and further behind in the\r\nyears afterward, no matter how hard they worked.\r\n\r\nWe've got to have a Government that can be a real partner in making this\r\nnew economy work for all of our people, a Government that helps each and\r\nevery one of us to get an education and to have the opportunity to renew\r\nour skills.\r\n\r\nEducation\r\n\r\nThat's why we worked so hard to increase educational opportunities in the\r\nlast two years from Head Start to public schools to apprenticeships for\r\nyoung people who don't go to college, to making college loans more\r\navailable and more affordable.\r\n\r\nThat's the first thing we have to do: We've got to do something to empower\r\npeople to improve their skills.\r\n\r\nTaxes\r\n\r\nSecond thing we ought to do is to help people raise their incomes\r\nimmediately by lowering their taxes.\r\n\r\nWe took the first step in 1993 with a working family tax cut for 15 million\r\nfamilies with incomes under $ 27,000, a tax cut that this year will average\r\nabout $ 1,000 a family.\r\n\r\nAnd we also gave tax reductions to most small and new businesses. Before we\r\ncould do more than that, we first had to bring down the deficit we\r\ninherited and we had to get economic growth up. Now we've done both, and\r\nnow we can cut taxes in a more comprehensive way.\r\n\r\nBut tax cuts should reinforce and promote our first obligation: to empower\r\nour citizens through education and training to make the most of their own\r\nlives. The spotlight should shine on those who make the right choices for\r\nthemselves, their families and their communities.\r\n\r\nMiddle Class Bill Of Rights\r\n\r\nI have proposed a middle-class bill of rights, which should properly be\r\ncalled the bill of rights and responsibilities, because its provisions only\r\nbenefit those who are working to educate and raise their children and to\r\neducate themselves. It will, therefore, give needed tax relief and raise\r\nincomes, in both the short run and the long run, in a way that benefits all\r\nof us.\r\n\r\nThere are four provisions:\r\n\r\nFirst, a tax deduction for all education and training after high school. If\r\nyou think about it, we permit businesses to deduct their investment, we\r\npermit individuals to deduct interest on their home mortgages, but today an\r\neducation is even more important to the economic well-being of our whole\r\ncountry than even those things are. We should do everything we can to\r\nencourage it, and I hope you will support it.\r\n\r\nSecond, we ought to cut taxes $ 500 for families with children under 13.\r\n\r\nThird, we ought to foster more savings and personal responsibility by\r\npermitting people to establish an individual retirement account and\r\nwithdraw from it tax free for the cost of education, health care,\r\nfirst-time home buying or the care of a parent.\r\n\r\nAnd fourth, we should pass a G.I. bill for America's workers. We propose to\r\ncollapse nearly 70 Federal programs and not give the money to the states\r\nbut give the money directly to the American people, offer vouchers to them\r\nso that they--if they're laid off or if they're working for a very low\r\nwage--can get a voucher worth $ 2,600 a year for up to two years to go to\r\ntheir local community colleges or wherever else they want to get the skills\r\nthey need to improve their lives. Let's empower people in this way. Move it\r\nfrom the Government directly to the workers of America.\r\n\r\nCutting The Deficit Now\r\n\r\nAny one of us can call for a tax cut, but I won't accept one that explodes\r\nthe deficit or puts our recovery at risk. We ought to pay for our tax cuts\r\nfully and honestly. Just two years ago it was an open question whether we\r\nwould find the strength to cut the deficit.\r\n\r\nThanks to the courage of the people who were here then, many of whom didn't\r\nreturn, we did cut the deficit. We began to do what others said would not\r\nbe done: We cut the deficit by over $ 600 billion, about $ 10,000 for every\r\nfamily in this country. It's coming down three years in a row for the first\r\ntime since Mr. Truman was President and I don't think anybody in America\r\nwants us to let it explode again.\r\n\r\nIn the budget I will send you, the middle-class bill of rights is fully\r\npaid for by budget cuts in bureaucracy, cuts in programs, cuts in special\r\ninterest subsidies. And the spending cuts will more than double the tax\r\ncuts. My budget pays for the middle-class bill of rights without any cuts\r\nin Medicare, and I will oppose any attempts to pay for tax cuts with\r\nMedicare cuts. That's not the right thing to do.\r\n\r\nI know that a lot of you have your own ideas about tax relief. And some of\r\nthem, I find quite interesting. I really want to work with all of you.\r\n\r\nMy tests for our proposals will be: Will it create jobs and raise incomes?\r\nWill it strengthen our families and support our children? Is it paid for?\r\nWill it build the middle class and shrink the underclass?\r\n\r\nIf it does, I'll support it. But if it doesn't, I won't.\r\n\r\nMinimum Wage\r\n\r\nThe goal of building the middle class and shrinking the underclass is also\r\nwhy I believe that you should raise the minimum wage.\r\n\r\nIt rewards work--two and a half million Americans, often women with\r\nchildren, are working out there today for four-and-a-quarter an hour. In\r\nterms of real buying power, by next year, that minimum wage will be at a\r\n40-year low. That's not my idea of how the new economy ought to work.\r\n\r\nNow I studied the arguments and the evidence for and against a minimum-wage\r\nincrease. I believe the weight of the evidence is that a modest increase\r\ndoes not cost jobs and may even lure people back into the job market. But\r\nthe most important thing is you can't make a living on $ 4.25 an hour. Now\r\n--especially if you have children, even with the working families tax cut\r\nwe passed last year.\r\n\r\nIn the past, the minimum wage has been a bipartisan issue and I think it\r\nshould be again. So I want to challenge you to have honest hearings on\r\nthis, to get together to find a way to make the minimum wage a living\r\nwage.\r\n\r\nMembers of Congress have been here less than a month but by the end of the\r\nweek--28 days into the new year--every member of Congress will have\r\nearned as much in congressional salary as a minimum-wage worker makes all\r\nyear long.\r\n\r\nEverybody else here, including the President, has something else that too\r\nmany Americans do without and that's health care.\r\n\r\nHealth Care\r\n\r\nNow, last year we almost came to blows over health care, but we didn't do\r\nanything. And the cold, hard fact is that since last year--since I was\r\nhere--another 1.1 million Americans in working families have lost their\r\nhealth care. And the cold, hard fact is that many millions more--most of\r\nthem farmers and small business people and self-employed people--have\r\nseen their premiums skyrocket, their co-pays and deductibles go up.\r\n\r\nThere's a whole bunch of people in this country that in the statistics have\r\nhealth insurance but really what they've got is a piece of paper that says\r\nthey won't lose their home if they get sick.\r\n\r\nNow I still believe our country has got to move toward providing health\r\nsecurity for every American family, but--but I know that last year, as the\r\nevidence indicates, we bit off more than we could chew.\r\n\r\nSo I'm asking you that we work together. Let's do it step by step. Let's do\r\nwhatever we have to do to get something done. Let's at least pass\r\nmeaningful insurance reform so that no American risks losing coverage for\r\nfacing skyrocketing prices but that nobody loses their coverage because\r\nthey face high prices or unavailable insurance when they change jobs or\r\nlose a job or a family member gets sick.\r\n\r\nI want to work together with all of you who have an interest in this: with\r\nthe Democrats who worked on it last time, with the Republican leaders like\r\nSenator Dole who has a longtime commitment to health care reform and made\r\nsome constructive proposals in this area last year. We ought to make sure\r\nthat self-employed people in small businesses can buy insurance at more\r\naffordable rates through voluntary purchasing pools. We ought to help\r\nfamilies provide long-term care for a sick parent to a disabled child. We\r\ncan work to help workers who lose their jobs at least keep their health\r\ninsurance coverage for a year while they look for work, and we can find a\r\nway--it may take some time, but we can find a way--to make sure that our\r\nchildren have health care.\r\n\r\nYou know, I think everybody in this room, without regard to party, can be\r\nproud of the fact that our country was rated as having the world's most\r\nproductive economy for the first time in nearly a decade, but we can't be\r\nproud of the fact that we're the only wealthy country in the world that has\r\na smaller percentage of the work force and their children with health\r\ninsurance today than we did 10 years ago--the last time we were the most\r\nproductive economy in the world.\r\n\r\nSo let's work together on this. It is too important for politics as usual.\r\n\r\nMuch of what the American people are thinking about tonight is what we've\r\nalready talked about. A lot of people think that the security concerns of\r\nAmerica today are entirely internal to our borders, they relate to the\r\nsecurity of our jobs and our homes and our incomes and our children, our\r\nstreets, our health and protecting those borders.\r\n\r\nForeign Policy\r\n\r\nNow that the Cold War has passed, it's tempting to believe that all the\r\nsecurity issues, with the possible exception of trade, reside here at home.\r\nBut it's not so. Our security still depends on our continued world\r\nleadership for peace and freedom and democracy. We still can't be strong at\r\nhome unless we're strong abroad.\r\n\r\nMexico\r\n\r\nThe financial crisis in Mexico is a case in point. I know it's not popular\r\nto say it tonight but we have to act, not for the Mexican people but for\r\nthe sake of the millions of Americans whose livelihoods are tied to\r\nMexico's well-being. If we want to secure American jobs, preserve American\r\nexports, safeguard America's borders then we must pass the stabilization\r\nprogram and help to put Mexico back on track.\r\n\r\nNow let me repeat: it's not a loan, it's not foreign aid, it's not a\r\nbail-out. We'll be given a guarantee like co-signing a note with good\r\ncollateral that will cover our risk.\r\n\r\nThis legislation is the right thing for America. That's why the bipartisan\r\nleadership has supported it. And I hope you in Congress will pass it\r\nquickly. It is in our interest and we can explain it to the American\r\npeople, because we're going to do it in the right way.\r\n\r\nRussia\r\n\r\nYou know, tonight this is the first State of the Union address ever\r\ndelivered since the beginning of the cold war when not a single Russian\r\nmissile is pointed at the children of America.\r\n\r\nAnd along with the Russians, we're on our way to destroying the missiles\r\nand the bombers that carry 9,000 nuclear warheads. We've come so far so\r\nfast in this post-cold-war world that it's easy to take the decline of the\r\nnuclear threat for granted. But it's still there, and we aren't finished\r\nyet.\r\n\r\nThis year, I'll ask the Senate to approve START II to eliminate weapons\r\nthat carry 5,000 more warheads. The United States will lead the charge to\r\nextend indefinitely the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, to enact a\r\ncomprehensive nuclear test ban, and to eliminate chemical weapons.\r\n\r\nNorth Korea\r\n\r\nTo stop and roll back North Korea's potentially deadly nuclear program,\r\nwe'll continue to implement the agreement we have reached with that nation.\r\nIt's smart, it's tough, it's a deal based on continuing inspection with\r\nsafeguards for our allies and ourselves.\r\n\r\nThis year, I'll submit to Congress comprehensive legislation to strengthen\r\nour hand in combating terrorists, whether they strike at home or abroad. As\r\nthe cowards who bombed the World Trade Center found out, this country will\r\nhunt down terrorists and bring them to justice.\r\n\r\nMiddle East\r\n\r\nJust this week, another horrendous terrorist act in Israel killed 19 and\r\ninjured scores more. On behalf of the American people and all of you, I\r\nsend our deepest sympathy to the families of the victims. I know that in\r\nthe face of such evil, it is hard for the people in the Middle East to go\r\nforward. But the terrorists represent the past, not the future. We must and\r\nwe will pursue a comprehensive peace between Israel and all her neighbors\r\nin the Middle East.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, last night I signed an executive order that will block the\r\nassets in the United States of terrorist organizations that threaten to\r\ndisrupt the peace process. It prohibits financial transactions with these\r\ngroups.\r\n\r\nAnd tonight I call on all our allies in peace-loving nations throughout the\r\nworld to join us with renewed fervor in a global effort to combat\r\nterrorism, we cannot permit the future to be marred by terror and fear and\r\nparalysis.\r\n\r\nDefense\r\n\r\nFrom the day I took the oath of office, I pledged that our nation would\r\nmaintain the best-equipped, best-trained and best-prepared military on\r\nearth. We have and they are. They have managed the dramatic downsizing of\r\nour forces after the cold war with remarkable skill and spirit. But to make\r\nsure our military is ready for action and to provide the pay and the\r\nquality of life the military and their families deserve, I'm asking the\r\nCongress to add $ 25 billion in defense spending over the next six years.\r\n\r\nI have visited many bases at home and around the world since I became\r\nPresident. Tonight I repeat that request with renewed conviction. We ask a\r\nvery great deal of our armed forces. Now that they are smaller in number,\r\nwe ask more of them. They go out more often to more different places and\r\nstay longer. They are called to service in many, many ways, and we must\r\ngive them and their families what the times demand and what they have\r\nearned.\r\n\r\nJust think about what our troops have done in the last year, showing\r\nAmerica at its best, helping to save hundreds of thousands of people in\r\nRwanda, moving with lightning speed to head off another threat to Kuwait,\r\ngiving freedom and democracy back to the people of Haiti.\r\n\r\nWe have proudly supported peace and prosperity and freedom from South\r\nAfrica to Northern Ireland, from Central and Eastern Europe to Asia, from\r\nLatin America to the Middle East. All these endeavors are good in those\r\nplaces but they make our future more confident and more secure.\r\n\r\nWell, my fellow Americans, that's my agenda for America's future: expanding\r\nopportunity not bureaucracy, enhancing security at home and abroad,\r\nempowering our people to make the most of their own lives.\r\n\r\nIt's ambitious and achievable. But it's not enough.\r\n\r\nWe even need more than new ideas for changing the world or equipping\r\nAmericans to compete in the new economy, more than a Government that's\r\nsmaller, smarter and wiser, more than all the changes we can make in\r\nGovernment and in the private sector from the outside in.\r\n\r\nValues And Voices\r\n\r\nOur fortunes and our prosperity also depend upon our ability to answer some\r\nquestions from within--from the values and voices that speak to our hearts\r\nas well as our heads, voices that tell us we have to do more to accept\r\nresponsibility for ourselves and our families, for our communities, and\r\nyes, for our fellow citizens.\r\n\r\nWe see our families and our communities all over this country coming apart.\r\nAnd we feel the common ground shifting from under us. The PTA, the town\r\nhall meeting, the ball park--it's hard for a lot of overworked parents to\r\nfind the time and space for those things that strengthen the bonds of trust\r\nand cooperation.\r\n\r\nToo many of our children don't even have parents and grandparents who can\r\ngive them those experiences that they need to build their own character and\r\ntheir sense of identity. We all know that while we here in this chamber can\r\nmake a difference on those things, that the real differences will be made\r\nby our fellow citizens where they work and where they live.\r\n\r\nAnd it'll be made almost without regard to party. When I used to go to the\r\nsoftball park in Little Rock to watch my daughter's league and people would\r\ncome up to me--fathers and mothers--and talk to me, I can honestly say I\r\nhad no idea whether 90 percent of them were Republicans or Democrats.\r\n\r\nWhen I visited the relief centers after the floods in California, Northern\r\nCalifornia, last week, a woman came up to me and did something that very\r\nfew of you would do. She hugged me and said, \"Mr. President, I'm a\r\nRepublican, but I'm glad you're here.\"\r\n\r\nNow, why? We can't wait for disasters to act the way we used to act every\r\nday. Because as we move into this next century, everybody matters. We don't\r\nhave a person to waste. And a lot of people are losing a lot of chances to\r\ndo better.\r\n\r\nThat means that we need a New Covenant for everybody--for our corporate\r\nand business leaders, we're going to work here to keep bringing the deficit\r\ndown, to expand markets, to support their success in every possible way.\r\nBut they have an obligation: when they're doing well, to keep jobs in our\r\ncommunities and give their workers a fair share of the prosperity they\r\ngenerate.\r\n\r\nFor people in the entertainment industry in this country, we applaud your\r\ncreativity and your worldwide success and we support your freedom of\r\nexpression but you do have a responsibility to assess the impact of your\r\nwork and to understand the damage that comes from the incessant,\r\nrepetitive, mindless violence and irresponsible conduct that permeates our\r\nmedia all the time.\r\n\r\nWe've got to ask our community leaders and all kinds of organizations to\r\nhelp us stop our most serious social problem: the epidemic of teen\r\npregnancies and births where there is no marriage. I have sent to Congress\r\na plan to target schools all over this country with anti-pregnancy programs\r\nthat work. But government can only do so much. Tonight, I call on parents\r\nand leaders all across this country to join together in a national campaign\r\nagainst teen pregnancy to make a difference. We can do this and we must.\r\n\r\nAnd I would like to say a special word to our religious leaders. You know,\r\nI'm proud of the fact that the United States has more house of worship per\r\ncapita than any country in the world. These people, who lead our houses of\r\nworship, can ignite their congregations to carry their faith into action,\r\ncan reach out to all of our children, to all of the people in distress, to\r\nthose who have been savaged by the breakdown of all we hold dear, because\r\nso much of what must be done must come from the inside out. And our\r\nreligious leaders and their congregations can make all the difference. They\r\nhave a role in the New Covenant as well.\r\n\r\nThere must be more responsibility for all of our citizens. You know it\r\ntakes a lot of people to help all the kids in trouble stay off the streets\r\nand in school. It takes a lot of people to build the Habitat for Humanity\r\nhouses that the Speaker celebrates on his lapel pin. It takes a lot of\r\npeople to provide the people power for all the civic organizations in this\r\ncountry that made our communities mean so much to most of us when we were\r\nkids. It takes every parent to teach the children the difference between\r\nright and wrong and to encourage them to learn and grow and to say no to\r\nthe wrong things but also to believe that they can be whatever they want to\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nI know it's hard when you're working harder for less, when you're under\r\ngreat stress, to do these things. A lot of our people don't have the time\r\nor the emotional stress they think to do the work of citizenship. Most of\r\nus in politics haven't helped very much. For years, we've mostly treated\r\ncitizens like they were consumers or spectators, sort of political couch\r\npotatoes who were supposed to watch the TV ads--either promise them\r\nsomething for nothing or play on their fears and frustrations. And more and\r\nmore of our citizens now get most of their information in very negative and\r\naggressive ways that is hardly conducive to honest and open conversations.\r\nBut the truth is we have got to stop seeing each other as enemies just\r\nbecause we have different views.\r\n\r\nIf you go back to the beginning of this country, the great strength of\r\nAmerica, as de Tocqueville pointed out when he came here a long time ago,\r\nhas always been our ability to associate with people who were different\r\nfrom ourselves and to work together to find common ground. And in this day\r\neverybody has a responsibility to do more of that. We simply cannot wait\r\nfor a tornado, a fire or a flood to behave like Americans ought to behave\r\nin dealing with one another.\r\n\r\nI want to finish up here by pointing out some folks that are up with the\r\nFirst Lady that represent what I'm trying to talk about. Citizens. I have\r\nno idea what their party affiliation is or who they voted for in the last\r\nelection, but they represent what we ought to be doing.\r\n\r\nCindy Perry teaches second-graders to read in AmeriCorps in rural Kentucky.\r\nShe gains when she gives. She's a mother of four.\r\n\r\nShe says that her service inspired her to get her high school equivalency\r\nlast year. She was married when she was a teen-ager. Stand up, Cindy. She\r\nmarried when she was a teen-ager. She had four children, but she had time\r\nto serve other people, to get her high school equivalency and she's going\r\nto use her AmeriCorps money to go back to college.\r\n\r\nSteven Bishop is the police chief of Kansas City. He's been a national\r\nleader--stand up Steve. He's been a national leader in using more police\r\nin community policing and he's worked with AmeriCorps to do it, and the\r\ncrime rate in Kansas City has gone down as a result of what he did.\r\n\r\nCpl. Gregory Depestre went to Haiti as part of his adopted country's force\r\nto help secure democracy in his native land. And I might add we must be the\r\nonly country in the world that could have gone to Haiti and taken\r\nHaitian-Americans there who could speak the language and talk to the\r\npeople, and he was one of them and we're proud of him.\r\n\r\nThe next two folks I've had the honor of meeting and getting to know a\r\nlittle bit. The Rev. John and the Rev. Diana Cherry of the A.M.E. Zion\r\nChurch in Temple Hills, Md. I'd like to ask them to stand. I want to tell\r\nyou about them. In the early 80's they left Government service and formed a\r\nchurch in a small living room in a small house in the early 80's. Today\r\nthat church has 17,000 members. It is one of the three or four biggest\r\nchurches in the entire United States. It grows by 200 a month.\r\n\r\nThey do it together. And the special focus of their ministry is keeping\r\nfamilies together. They are--Two things they did make a big impression on\r\nme. I visited their church once and I learned they were building a new\r\nsanctuary closer to the Washington, D.C., line, in a higher-crime,\r\nhigher-drug-rate area because they thought it was part of their ministry to\r\nchange the lives of the people who needed them. Second thing I want to say\r\nis that once Reverend Cherry was at a meeting at the White House with some\r\nother religious leaders and he left early to go back to his church to\r\nminister to 150 couples that he had brought back to his church from all\r\nover America to convince them to come back together to save their marriages\r\nand to raise their kids. This is the kind of work that citizens are doing\r\nin America. We need more of it and it ought to be lifted up and supported.\r\n\r\nThe last person I want to introduce is Jack Lucas from Hattiesburg,\r\nMississippi. Jack, would you stand up. Fifty years ago in the sands of Iwo\r\nJima, Jack Lucas taught and learned the lessons of citizenship. On February\r\nthe 20th, 1945, he and three of his buddies encountered the enemy and two\r\ngrenades at their feet. Jack Lucas threw himself on both of them. In that\r\nmoment he saved the lives of his companions and miraculously in the next\r\ninstant a medic saved his life. He gained a foothold for freedom and at the\r\nage of 17, just a year older than his grandson, who's up there with him\r\ntoday, and his son, who is a West Point graduate and a veteran, at 17, Jack\r\nLucas became the youngest marine in history and the youngest soldier in\r\nthis century to win the Congressional Medal of Honor. All these years\r\nlater, yesterday, here's what he said about that day: Didn't matter where\r\nyou were from or who you were. You relied on one another. You did it for\r\nyour country. We all gain when we give and we reap what we sow. That's at\r\nthe heart of this New Covenant. Responsibility, opportunity and\r\ncitizenship.\r\n\r\nMore than stale chapters in some remote civic book they're still the virtue\r\nby which we can fulfill ourselves and reach our God-given potential and be\r\nlike them. And also to fulfill the eternal promise of this country, the\r\nenduring dream from that first and most-sacred covenant. I believe every\r\nperson in this country still believes that we are created equal and given\r\nby our creator the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\r\n\r\nThis is a very, very great country and our best days are still to come.\r\nThank you and God bless you all.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nWilliam J. Clinton\r\nJanuary 23, 1996\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of the 104th Congress,\r\ndistinguished guests, my fellow Americans all across our land:\r\n\r\nLet me begin tonight by saying to our men and women in uniform around the\r\nworld, and especially those helping peace take root in Bosnia and to their\r\nfamilies, I thank you. America is very, very proud of you.\r\n\r\nMy duty tonight is to report on the state of the Union--not the state of\r\nour government, but of our American community; and to set forth our\r\nresponsibilities, in the words of our Founders, to form a more perfect\r\nunion.\r\n\r\nThe state of the Union is strong. Our economy is the healthiest it has been\r\nin three decades. We have the lowest combined rates of unemployment and\r\ninflation in 27 years. We have created nearly 8 million new jobs, over a\r\nmillion of them in basic industries, like construction and automobiles.\r\nAmerica is selling more cars than Japan for the first time since the 1970s.\r\nAnd for three years in a row, we have had a record number of new businesses\r\nstarted in our country.\r\n\r\nOur leadership in the world is also strong, bringing hope for new peace.\r\nAnd perhaps most important, we are gaining ground in restoring our\r\nfundamental values. The crime rate, the welfare and food stamp rolls, the\r\npoverty rate and the teen pregnancy rate are all down. And as they go down,\r\nprospects for America's future go up.\r\n\r\nWe live in an age of possibility. A hundred years ago we moved from farm to\r\nfactory. Now we move to an age of technology, information, and global\r\ncompetition. These changes have opened vast new opportunities for our\r\npeople, but they have also presented them with stiff challenges. While more\r\nAmericans are living better, too many of our fellow citizens are working\r\nharder just to keep up, and they are rightly concerned about the security\r\nof their families.\r\n\r\nThe Role Of Government\r\n\r\nWe must answer here three fundamental questions: First, how do we make the\r\nAmerican Dream of opportunity for all a reality for all Americans who are\r\nwilling to work for it? Second, how do we preserve our old and enduring\r\nvalues as we move into the future? And, third, how do we meet these\r\nchallenges together, as one America?\r\n\r\nWe know big government does not have all the answers. We know there's not a\r\nprogram for every problem. We have worked to give the American people a\r\nsmaller, less bureaucratic government in Washington. And we have to give\r\nthe American people one that lives within its means.\r\n\r\nThe era of big government is over. But we cannot go back to the time when\r\nour citizens were left to fend for themselves. Instead, we must go forward\r\nas one America, one nation working together to meet the challenges we face\r\ntogether. Self-reliance and teamwork are not opposing virtues; we must have\r\nboth.\r\n\r\nI believe our new, smaller government must work in an old-fashioned\r\nAmerican way, together with all of our citizens through state and local\r\ngovernments, in the workplace, in religious, charitable and civic\r\nassociations. Our goal must be to enable all our people to make the most of\r\ntheir own lives--with stronger families, more educational opportunity,\r\neconomic security, safer streets, a cleaner environment in a safer world.\r\n\r\nTo improve the state of our Union, we must ask more of ourselves, we must\r\nexpect more of each other, and we must face our challenges together.\r\n\r\nHere, in this place, our responsibility begins with balancing the budget in\r\na way that is fair to all Americans. There is now broad bipartisan\r\nagreement that permanent deficit spending must come to an end.\r\n\r\nI compliment the Republican leadership and the membership for the energy\r\nand determination you have brought to this task of balancing the budget.\r\nAnd I thank the Democrats for passing the largest deficit reduction plan in\r\nhistory in 1993, which has already cut the deficit nearly in half in three\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nDeficit\r\n\r\nSince 1993, we have all begun to see the benefits of deficit reduction.\r\nLower interest rates have made it easier for businesses to borrow and to\r\ninvest and to create new jobs. Lower interest rates have brought down the\r\ncost of home mortgages, car payments and credit card rates to ordinary\r\ncitizens. Now, it is time to finish the job and balance the budget.\r\n\r\nThough differences remain among us which are significant, the combined\r\ntotal of the proposed savings that are common to both plans is more than\r\nenough, using the numbers from your Congressional Budget Office to balance\r\nthe budget in seven years and to provide a modest tax cut.\r\n\r\nThese cuts are real. They will require sacrifice from everyone. But these\r\ncuts do not undermine our fundamental obligations to our parents, our\r\nchildren, and our future, by endangering Medicare, or Medicaid, or\r\neducation, or the environment, or by raising taxes on working families.\r\n\r\nI have said before, and let me say again, many good ideas have come out of\r\nour negotiations. I have learned a lot about the way both Republicans and\r\nDemocrats view the debate before us. I have learned a lot about the good\r\nideas that we could all embrace.\r\n\r\nWe ought to resolve our remaining differences. I am willing to work to\r\nresolve them. I am ready to meet tomorrow. But I ask you to consider that\r\nwe should at least enact these savings that both plans have in common and\r\ngive the American people their balanced budget, a tax cut, lower interest\r\nrates, and a brighter future. We should do that now, and make permanent\r\ndeficits yesterday's legacy.\r\n\r\nNow it is time for us to look also to the challenges of today and tomorrow,\r\nbeyond the burdens of yesterday. The challenges are significant. But\r\nAmerica was built on challenges, not promises. And when we work together to\r\nmeet them, we never fail. That is the key to a more perfect Union. Our\r\nindividual dreams must be realized by our common efforts.\r\n\r\nTonight I want to speak to you about the challenges we all face as a\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nStrengthening Families\r\n\r\nOur first challenge is to cherish our children and strengthen America's\r\nfamilies. Family is the foundation of American life. If we have stronger\r\nfamilies, we will have a stronger America.\r\n\r\nBefore I go on, I would like to take just a moment to thank my own family,\r\nand to thank the person who has taught me more than anyone else over 25\r\nyears about the importance of families and children--a wonderful wife, a\r\nmagnificent mother and a great First Lady. Thank you, Hillary.\r\n\r\nAll strong families begin with taking more responsibility for our children.\r\nI have heard Mrs. Gore say that it's hard to be a parent today, but it's\r\neven harder to be a child. So all of us, not just as parents, but all of us\r\nin our other roles--our media, our schools, our teachers, our communities,\r\nour churches and synagogues, our businesses, our governments--all of us\r\nhave a responsibility to help our children to make it and to make the most\r\nof their lives and their God-given capacities.\r\n\r\nTo the media, I say you should create movies and CDs and television shows\r\nyou'd want your own children and grandchildren to enjoy.\r\n\r\nI call on Congress to pass the requirement for a V-chip in TV sets so that\r\nparents can screen out programs they believe are inappropriate for their\r\nchildren. When parents control what their young children see, that is not\r\ncensorship; that is enabling parents to assume more personal responsibility\r\nfor their children's upbringing. And I urge them to do it. The V-chip\r\nrequirement is part of the important telecommunications bill now pending in\r\nthis Congress. It has bipartisan support, and I urge you to pass it now.\r\n\r\nTo make the V-chip work, I challenge the broadcast industry to do what\r\nmovies have done--to identify your programming in ways that help parents\r\nto protect their children. And I invite the leaders of major media\r\ncorporations in the entertainment industry to come to the White House next\r\nmonth to work with us in a positive way on concrete ways to improve what\r\nour children see on television. I am ready to work with you.\r\n\r\nI say to those who make and market cigarettes: every year a million\r\nchildren take up smoking, even though it is against the law. Three hundred\r\nthousand of them will have their lives shortened as a result. Our\r\nadministration has taken steps to stop the massive marketing campaigns that\r\nappeal to our children. We are simply saying: Market your products to\r\nadults, if you wish, but draw the line on children.\r\n\r\nI say to those who are on welfare, and especially to those who have been\r\ntrapped on welfare for a long time: For too long our welfare system has\r\nundermined the values of family and work, instead of supporting them. The\r\nCongress and I are near agreement on sweeping welfare reform. We agree on\r\ntime limits, tough work requirements, and the toughest possible child\r\nsupport enforcement. But I believe we must also provide child care so that\r\nmothers who are required to go to work can do so without worrying about\r\nwhat is happening to their children.\r\n\r\nI challenge this Congress to send me a bipartisan welfare reform bill that\r\nwill really move people from welfare to work and do the right thing by our\r\nchildren. I will sign it immediately.\r\n\r\nLet us be candid about this difficult problem. Passing a law, even the best\r\npossible law, is only a first step. The next step is to make it work. I\r\nchallenge people on welfare to make the most of this opportunity for\r\nindependence. I challenge American businesses to give people on welfare the\r\nchance to move into the work force. I applaud the work of religious groups\r\nand others who care for the poor. More than anyone else in our society,\r\nthey know the true difficulty of the task before us, and they are in a\r\nposition to help. Every one of us should join them. That is the only way we\r\ncan make real welfare reform a reality in the lives of the American\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nTo strengthen the family we must do everything we can to keep the teen\r\npregnancy rate going down. I am gratified, as I'm sure all Americans are,\r\nthat it has dropped for two years in a row. But we all know it is still far\r\ntoo high.\r\n\r\nTonight I am pleased to announce that a group of prominent Americans is\r\nresponding to that challenge by forming an organization that will support\r\ngrass-roots community efforts all across our country in a national campaign\r\nagainst teen pregnancy. And I challenge all of us and every American to\r\njoin their efforts.\r\n\r\nI call on American men and women in families to give greater respect to one\r\nanother. We must end the deadly scourge of domestic violence in our\r\ncountry. And I challenge America's families to work harder to stay\r\ntogether. For families who stay together not only do better economically,\r\ntheir children do better as well.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I challenge the fathers of this country to love and care for\r\ntheir children. If your family has separated, you must pay your child\r\nsupport. We're doing more than ever to make sure you do, and we're going to\r\ndo more, but let's all admit something about that, too: A check will not\r\nsubstitute for a parent's love and guidance. And only you--only you can\r\nmake the decision to help raise your children. No matter who you are, how\r\nlow or high your station in life, it is the most basic human duty of every\r\nAmerican to do that job to the best of his or her ability.\r\n\r\nEducation\r\n\r\nOur second challenge is to provide Americans with the educational\r\nopportunities we will all need for this new century. In our schools, every\r\nclassroom in America must be connected to the information superhighway,\r\nwith computers and good software, and well-trained teachers. We are working\r\nwith the telecommunications industry, educators and parents to connect 20\r\npercent of California's classrooms by this spring, and every classroom and\r\nevery library in the entire United States by the year 2000. I ask Congress\r\nto support this education technology initiative so that we can make sure\r\nthis national partnership succeeds.\r\n\r\nEvery diploma ought to mean something. I challenge every community, every\r\nschool and every state to adopt national standards of excellence; to\r\nmeasure whether schools are meeting those standards; to cut bureaucratic\r\nred tape so that schools and teachers have more flexibility for grass-roots\r\nreform; and to hold them accountable for results. That's what our Goals\r\n2000 initiative is all about.\r\n\r\nI challenge every state to give all parents the right to choose which\r\npublic school their children will attend; and to let teachers form new\r\nschools with a charter they can keep only if they do a good job.\r\n\r\nI challenge all our schools to teach character education, to teach good\r\nvalues and good citizenship. And if it means that teenagers will stop\r\nkilling each other over designer jackets, then our public schools should be\r\nable to require their students to wear school uniforms.\r\n\r\nI challenge our parents to become their children's first teachers. Turn off\r\nthe TV. See that the homework is done. And visit your children's classroom.\r\nNo program, no teacher, no one else can do that for you.\r\n\r\nMy fellow Americans, higher education is more important today than ever\r\nbefore. We've created a new student loan program that's made it easier to\r\nborrow and repay those loans, and we have dramatically cut the student loan\r\ndefault rate. That's something we should all be proud of, because it was\r\nunconscionably high just a few years ago. Through AmeriCorps, our national\r\nservice program, this year 25,000 young people will earn college money by\r\nserving their local communities to improve the lives of their friends and\r\nneighbors. These initiatives are right for America and we should keep them\r\ngoing.\r\n\r\nAnd we should also work hard to open the doors of college even wider. I\r\nchallenge Congress to expand work-study and help one million young\r\nAmericans work their way through college by the year 2000; to provide a\r\n$1000 merit scholarship for the top five percent of graduates in every high\r\nschool in the United States; to expand Pell Grant scholarships for\r\ndeserving and needy students; and to make up to $10,000 a year of college\r\ntuition tax deductible. It's a good idea for America.\r\n\r\nOur third challenge is to help every American who is willing to work for\r\nit, achieve economic security in this new age. People who work hard still\r\nneed support to get ahead in the new economy. They need education and\r\ntraining for a lifetime. They need more support for families raising\r\nchildren. They need retirement security. They need access to health care.\r\nMore and more Americans are finding that the education of their childhood\r\nsimply doesn't last a lifetime.\r\n\r\nG.I. Bill For Workers\r\n\r\nSo I challenge Congress to consolidate 70 overlapping, antiquated\r\njob-training programs into a simple voucher worth $2,600 for unemployed or\r\nunderemployed workers to use as they please for community college tuition\r\nor other training. This is a G.I. Bill for America's workers we should all\r\nbe able to agree on.\r\n\r\nMore and more Americans are working hard without a raise. Congress sets the\r\nminimum wage. Within a year, the minimum wage will fall to a 40-year low in\r\npurchasing power. Four dollars and 25 cents an hour is no longer a living\r\nwage, but millions of Americans and their children are trying to live on\r\nit. I challenge you to raise their minimum wage.\r\n\r\nIn 1993, Congress cut the taxes of 15 million hard-pressed working families\r\nto make sure that no parents who work full-time would have to raise their\r\nchildren in poverty, and to encourage people to move from welfare to work.\r\nThis expanded earned income tax credit is now worth about $1,800 a year to\r\na family of four living on $20,000. The budget bill I vetoed would have\r\nreversed this achievement and raised taxes on nearly 8 million of these\r\npeople. We should not do that.\r\n\r\nI also agree that the people who are helped under this initiative are not\r\nall those in our country who are working hard to do a good job raising\r\ntheir children and at work. I agree that we need a tax credit for working\r\nfamilies with children. That's one of the things most of us in this\r\nChamber, I hope, can agree on. I know it is strongly supported by the\r\nRepublican majority. And it should be part of any final budget agreement.\r\n\r\nI want to challenge every business that can possibly afford it to provide\r\npensions for your employees. And I challenge Congress to pass a proposal\r\nrecommended by the White House Conference on Small Business that would make\r\nit easier for small businesses and farmers to establish their own pension\r\nplans. That is something we should all agree on.\r\n\r\nWe should also protect existing pension plans. Two years ago, with\r\nbipartisan support that was almost unanimous on both sides of the aisle, we\r\nmoved to protect the pensions of 8 million working people and to stabilize\r\nthe pensions of 32 million more. Congress should not now let companies\r\nendanger those workers' pension funds. I know the proposal to liberalize\r\nthe ability of employers to take money out of pension funds for other\r\npurposes would raise money for the treasury. But I believe it is false\r\neconomy. I vetoed that proposal last year, and I would have to do so\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nHealth Care\r\n\r\nFinally, if our working families are going to succeed in the new economy,\r\nthey must be able to buy health insurance policies that they do not lose\r\nwhen they change jobs or when someone in their family gets sick. Over the\r\npast two years, over one million Americans in working families have lost\r\ntheir health insurance. We have to do more to make health care available to\r\nevery American. And Congress should start by passing the bipartisan bill\r\nsponsored by Senator Kennedy and Senator Kassebaum that would require\r\ninsurance companies to stop dropping people when they switch jobs, and stop\r\ndenying coverage for preexisting conditions. Let's all do that.\r\n\r\nAnd even as we enact savings in these programs, we must have a common\r\ncommitment to preserve the basic protections of Medicare and Medicaid--not\r\njust to the poor, but to people in working families, including children,\r\npeople with disabilities, people with AIDS, and senior citizens in nursing\r\nhomes.\r\n\r\nIn the past three years, we've saved $15 billion just by fighting health\r\ncare fraud and abuse. We have all agreed to save much more. We have all\r\nagreed to stabilize the Medicare Trust Fund. But we must not abandon our\r\nfundamental obligations to the people who need Medicare and Medicaid.\r\nAmerica cannot become stronger if they become weaker.\r\n\r\nThe G.I. Bill for workers, tax relief for education and child rearing,\r\npension availability and protection, access to health care, preservation of\r\nMedicare and Medicaid--these things, along with the Family and Medical\r\nLeave Act passed in 1993--these things will help responsible, hard-working\r\nAmerican families to make the most of their own lives.\r\n\r\nBut employers and employees must do their part, as well, as they are doing\r\nin so many of our finest companies--working together, putting the\r\nlong-term prosperity ahead of the short-term gain. As workers increase\r\ntheir hours and their productivity, employers should make sure they get the\r\nskills they need and share the benefits of the good years, as well as the\r\nburdens of the bad ones. When companies and workers work as a team they do\r\nbetter, and so does America.\r\n\r\nCrime\r\n\r\nOur fourth great challenge is to take our streets back from crime and gangs\r\nand drugs. At last we have begun to find a way to reduce crime, forming\r\ncommunity partnerships with local police forces to catch criminals and\r\nprevent crime. This strategy, called community policing, is clearly\r\nworking. Violent crime is coming down all across America. In New York City\r\nmurders are down 25 percent; in St. Louis, 18 percent; in Seattle, 32\r\npercent. But we still have a long way to go before our streets are safe and\r\nour people are free from fear.\r\n\r\nThe Crime Bill of 1994 is critical to the success of community policing. It\r\nprovides funds for 100,000 new police in communities of all sizes. We're\r\nalready a third of the way there. And I challenge the Congress to finish\r\nthe job. Let us stick with a strategy that's working and keep the crime\r\nrate coming down.\r\n\r\nCommunity policing also requires bonds of trust between citizens and\r\npolice. I ask all Americans to respect and support our law enforcement\r\nofficers. And to our police, I say, our children need you as role models\r\nand heroes. Don't let them down.\r\n\r\nThe Brady Bill has already stopped 44,000 people with criminal records from\r\nbuying guns. The assault weapons ban is keeping 19 kinds of assault weapons\r\nout of the hands of violent gangs. I challenge the Congress to keep those\r\nlaws on the books.\r\n\r\nOur next step in the fight against crime is to take on gangs the way we\r\nonce took on the mob. I'm directing the FBI and other investigative\r\nagencies to target gangs that involve juveniles in violent crime, and to\r\nseek authority to prosecute as adults teenagers who maim and kill like\r\nadults.\r\n\r\nAnd I challenge local housing authorities and tenant associations: Criminal\r\ngang members and drug dealers are destroying the lives of decent tenants.\r\nFrom now on, the rule for residents who commit crime and peddle drugs\r\nshould be one strike and you're out.\r\n\r\nI challenge every state to match federal policy to assure that serious\r\nviolent criminals serve at least 85 percent of their sentence.\r\n\r\nMore police and punishment are important, but they're not enough. We have\r\ngot to keep more of our young people out of trouble, with prevention\r\nstrategies not dictated by Washington, but developed in communities. I\r\nchallenge all of our communities, all of our adults, to give our children\r\nfutures to say yes to. And I challenge Congress not to abandon the Crime\r\nBill's support of these grass-roots prevention efforts.\r\n\r\nFinally, to reduce crime and violence we have to reduce the drug problem.\r\nThe challenge begins in our homes, with parents talking to their children\r\nopenly and firmly. It embraces our churches and synagogues, our youth\r\ngroups and our schools.\r\n\r\nI challenge Congress not to cut our support for drug-free schools. People\r\nlike the D.A.R.E. officers are making a real impression on grade\r\nschoolchildren that will give them the strength to say no when the time\r\ncomes.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, we continue our efforts to cut the flow of drugs into America.\r\nFor the last two years, one man in particular has been on the front lines\r\nof that effort. Tonight I am nominating him--a hero of the Persian Gulf\r\nWar and the Commander in Chief of the United States Military Southern\r\nCommand--General Barry McCaffrey, as America's new Drug Czar.\r\n\r\nGeneral McCaffrey has earned three Purple Hearts and two Silver Stars\r\nfighting for this country. Tonight I ask that he lead our nation's battle\r\nagainst drugs at home and abroad. To succeed, he needs a force far larger\r\nthan he has ever commanded before. He needs all of us. Every one of us has\r\na role to play on this team.\r\n\r\nThank you, General McCaffrey, for agreeing to serve your country one more\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nEnvironment\r\n\r\nOur fifth challenge: to leave our environment safe and clean for the next\r\ngeneration. Because of a generation of bipartisan effort we do have cleaner\r\nwater and air, lead levels in children's blood has been cut by 70 percent,\r\ntoxic emissions from factories cut in half. Lake Erie was dead, and now\r\nit's a thriving resource. But 10 million children under 12 still live\r\nwithin four miles of a toxic waste dump. A third of us breathe air that\r\nendangers our health. And in too many communities, the water is not safe to\r\ndrink. We still have much to do.\r\n\r\nYet Congress has voted to cut environmental enforcement by 25 percent. That\r\nmeans more toxic chemicals in our water, more smog in our air, more\r\npesticides in our food. Lobbyists for polluters have been allowed to write\r\ntheir own loopholes into bills to weaken laws that protect the health and\r\nsafety of our children. Some say that the taxpayer should pick up the tab\r\nfor toxic waste and let polluters who can afford to fix it off the hook. I\r\nchallenge Congress to reexamine those policies and to reverse them.\r\n\r\nThis issue has not been a partisan issue. The most significant\r\nenvironmental gains in the last 30 years were made under a Democratic\r\nCongress and President Richard Nixon. We can work together. We have to\r\nbelieve some basic things. Do you believe we can expand the economy without\r\nhurting the environment? I do. Do you believe we can create more jobs over\r\nthe long run by cleaning the environment up? I know we can. That should be\r\nour commitment.\r\n\r\nWe must challenge businesses and communities to take more initiative in\r\nprotecting the environment, and we have to make it easier for them to do\r\nit. To businesses this administration is saying: If you can find a cheaper,\r\nmore efficient way than government regulations require to meet tough\r\npollution standards, do it--as long as you do it right. To communities we\r\nsay: We must strengthen community right-to-know laws requiring polluters to\r\ndisclose their emissions, but you have to use the information to work with\r\nbusiness to cut pollution. People do have a right to know that their air\r\nand their water are safe.\r\n\r\nForeign Policy\r\n\r\nOur sixth challenge is to maintain America's leadership in the fight for\r\nfreedom and peace throughout the world. Because of American leadership,\r\nmore people than ever before live free and at peace. And Americans have\r\nknown 50 years of prosperity and security.\r\n\r\nWe owe thanks especially to our veterans of World War II. I would like to\r\nsay to Senator Bob Dole and to all others in this Chamber who fought in\r\nWorld War II, and to all others on both sides of the aisle who have fought\r\nbravely in all our conflicts since: I salute your service, and so do the\r\nAmerican people.\r\n\r\nAll over the world, even after the Cold War, people still look to us and\r\ntrust us to help them seek the blessings of peace and freedom. But as the\r\nCold War fades into memory, voices of isolation say America should retreat\r\nfrom its responsibilities. I say they are wrong.\r\n\r\nThe threats we face today as Americans respect no nation's borders. Think\r\nof them: terrorism, the spread of weapons of mass destruction, organized\r\ncrime, drug trafficking, ethnic and religious hatred, aggression by rogue\r\nstates, environmental degradation. If we fail to address these threats\r\ntoday, we will suffer the consequences in all our tomorrows.\r\n\r\nOf course, we can't be everywhere. Of course, we can't do everything. But\r\nwhere our interests and our values are at stake, and where we can make a\r\ndifference, America must lead. We must not be isolationist.\r\n\r\nWe must not be the world's policeman. But we can and should be the world's\r\nvery best peacemaker. By keeping our military strong, by using diplomacy\r\nwhere we can and force where we must, by working with others to share the\r\nrisk and the cost of our efforts, America is making a difference for people\r\nhere and around the world. For the first time since the dawn of the nuclear\r\nage, there is not a single Russian missile pointed at America's children.\r\n\r\nNorth Korea\r\n\r\nNorth Korea has now frozen its dangerous nuclear weapons program. In Haiti,\r\nthe dictators are gone, democracy has a new day, the flow of desperate\r\nrefugees to our shores has subsided. Through tougher trade deals for\r\nAmerica--over 80 of them--we have opened markets abroad, and now exports\r\nare at an all-time high, growing faster than imports and creating good\r\nAmerican jobs.\r\n\r\nNorthern Ireland\r\n\r\nWe stood with those taking risks for peace: In Northern Ireland, where\r\nCatholic and Protestant children now tell their parents, violence must\r\nnever return. In the Middle East, where Arabs and Jews who once seemed\r\ndestined to fight forever now share knowledge and resources, and even\r\ndreams.\r\n\r\nBosnia\r\n\r\nAnd we stood up for peace in Bosnia. Remember the skeletal prisoners, the\r\nmass graves, the campaign to rape and torture, the endless lines of\r\nrefugees, the threat of a spreading war. All these threats, all these\r\nhorrors have now begun to give way to the promise of peace. Now, our troops\r\nand a strong NATO, together with our new partners from Central Europe and\r\nelsewhere, are helping that peace to take hold.\r\n\r\nAs all of you know, I was just there with a bipartisan congressional group,\r\nand I was so proud not only of what our troops were doing, but of the pride\r\nthey evidenced in what they were doing. They knew what America's mission in\r\nthis world is, and they were proud to be carrying it out.\r\n\r\nThrough these efforts, we have enhanced the security of the American\r\npeople. But make no mistake about it: important challenges remain.\r\n\r\nRussia\r\n\r\nThe START II Treaty with Russia will cut our nuclear stockpiles by another\r\n25 percent. I urge the Senate to ratify it--now. We must end the race to\r\ncreate new nuclear weapons by signing a truly comprehensive nuclear test\r\nban treaty--this year.\r\n\r\nAs we remember what happened in the Japanese subway, we can outlaw poison\r\ngas forever if the Senate ratifies the Chemical Weapons Convention--this\r\nyear. We can intensify the fight against terrorists and organized criminals\r\nat home and abroad if Congress passes the anti-terrorism legislation I\r\nproposed after the Oklahoma City bombing--now. We can help more people\r\nmove from hatred to hope all across the world in our own interest if\r\nCongress gives us the means to remain the world's leader for peace.\r\n\r\nMy fellow Americans, the six challenges I have just discussed are for all\r\nof us. Our seventh challenge is really America's challenge to those of us\r\nin this hallowed hall tonight: to reinvent our government and make our\r\ndemocracy work for them.\r\n\r\nReform\r\n\r\nLast year this Congress applied to itself the laws it applies to everyone\r\nelse. This Congress banned gifts and meals from lobbyists. This Congress\r\nforced lobbyists to disclose who pays them and what legislation they are\r\ntrying to pass or kill. This Congress did that, and I applaud you for it.\r\n\r\nNow I challenge Congress to go further--to curb special interest influence\r\nin politics by passing the first truly bipartisan campaign reform bill in a\r\ngeneration. You, Republicans and Democrats alike, can show the American\r\npeople that we can limit spending and open the airwaves to all candidates.\r\n\r\nI also appeal to Congress to pass the line-item veto you promised the\r\nAmerican people.\r\n\r\nOur administration is working hard to give the American people a government\r\nthat works better and costs less. Thanks to the work of Vice President\r\nGore, we are eliminating 16,000 pages of unnecessary rules and regulations,\r\nshifting more decision-making out of Washington, back to states and local\r\ncommunities.\r\n\r\nAs we move into the era of balanced budgets and smaller government, we must\r\nwork in new ways to enable people to make the most of their own lives. We\r\nare helping America's communities, not with more bureaucracy, but with more\r\nopportunities. Through our successful Empowerment Zones and Community\r\nDevelopment Banks, we are helping people to find jobs, to start businesses.\r\nAnd with tax incentives for companies that clean up abandoned industrial\r\nproperty, we can bring jobs back to places that desperately, desperately\r\nneed them.\r\n\r\nBut there are some areas that the federal government should not leave and\r\nshould address and address strongly. One of these areas is the problem of\r\nillegal immigration. After years of neglect, this administration has taken\r\na strong stand to stiffen the protection of our borders. We are increasing\r\nborder controls by 50 percent. We are increasing inspections to prevent the\r\nhiring of illegal immigrants. And tonight, I announce I will sign an\r\nexecutive order to deny federal contracts to businesses that hire illegal\r\nimmigrants.\r\n\r\nLet me be very clear about this: We are still a nation of immigrants; we\r\nshould be proud of it. We should honor every legal immigrant here, working\r\nhard to become a new citizen. But we are also a nation of laws.\r\n\r\nI want to say a special word now to those who work for our federal\r\ngovernment. Today our federal government is 200,000 employees smaller than\r\nit was the day I took office as President.\r\n\r\nOur federal government today is the smallest it has been in 30 years, and\r\nit's getting smaller every day. Most of our fellow Americans probably don't\r\nknow that. And there is a good reason: The remaining federal work force is\r\ncomposed of Americans who are now working harder and working smarter than\r\never before, to make sure the quality of our services does not decline.\r\n\r\nI'd like to give you one example. His name is Richard Dean. He is a 49\r\nyear-old Vietnam veteran who's worked for the Social Security\r\nAdministration for 22 years now. Last year he was hard at work in the\r\nFederal Building in Oklahoma City when the blast killed 169 people and\r\nbrought the rubble down all around him. He reentered that building four\r\ntimes. He saved the lives of three women. He's here with us this evening,\r\nand I want to recognize Richard and applaud both his public service and his\r\nextraordinary personal heroism.\r\n\r\nBut Richard Dean's story doesn't end there. This last November, he was\r\nforced out of his office when the government shut down. And the second time\r\nthe government shut down he continued helping Social Security recipients,\r\nbut he was working without pay.\r\n\r\nOn behalf of Richard Dean and his family, and all the other people who are\r\nout there working every day doing a good job for the American people, I\r\nchallenge all of you in this Chamber: Never, ever shut the federal\r\ngovernment down again.\r\n\r\nOn behalf of all Americans, especially those who need their Social Security\r\npayments at the beginning of March, I also challenge the Congress to\r\npreserve the full faith and credit of the United States--to honor the\r\nobligations of this great nation as we have for 220 years; to rise above\r\npartisanship and pass a straightforward extension of the debt limit and\r\nshow people America keeps its word.\r\n\r\nI know that this evening I have asked a lot of Congress, and even more from\r\nAmerica. But I am confident: When Americans work together in their homes,\r\ntheir schools, their churches, their synagogues, their civic groups, their\r\nworkplace, they can meet any challenge.\r\n\r\nI say again, the era of big government is over. But we can't go back to the\r\nera of fending for yourself. We have to go forward to the era of working\r\ntogether as a community, as a team, as one America, with all of us reaching\r\nacross these lines that divide us--the division, the discrimination, the\r\nrancor--we have to reach across it to find common ground. We have got to\r\nwork together if we want America to work.\r\n\r\nI want you to meet two more people tonight who do just that. Lucius Wright\r\nis a teacher in the Jackson, Mississippi, public school system. A Vietnam\r\nveteran, he has created groups to help inner-city children turn away from\r\ngangs and build futures they can believe in. Sergeant Jennifer Rodgers is a\r\npolice officer in Oklahoma City. Like Richard Dean, she helped to pull her\r\nfellow citizens out of the rubble and deal with that awful tragedy. She\r\nreminds us that in their response to that atrocity the people of Oklahoma\r\nCity lifted all of us with their basic sense of decency and community.\r\n\r\nLucius Wright and Jennifer Rodgers are special Americans. And I have the\r\nhonor to announce tonight that they are the very first of several thousand\r\nAmericans who will be chosen to carry the Olympic torch on its long journey\r\nfrom Los Angeles to the centennial of the modern Olympics in Atlanta this\r\nsummer--not because they are star athletes, but because they are star\r\ncitizens, community heroes meeting America's challenges. They are our real\r\nchampions.\r\n\r\nNow, each of us must hold high the torch of citizenship in our own lives.\r\nNone of us can finish the race alone. We can only achieve our destiny\r\ntogether--one hand, one generation, one American connecting to another.\r\n\r\nThere have always been things we could do together--dreams we could make\r\nreal--which we could never have done on our own. We Americans have forged\r\nour identity, our very union, from every point of view and every point on\r\nthe planet, every different opinion. But we must be bound together by a\r\nfaith more powerful than any doctrine that divides us--by our belief in\r\nprogress, our love of liberty, and our relentless search for common\r\nground.\r\n\r\nAmerica has always sought and always risen to every challenge. Who would\r\nsay that, having come so far together, we will not go forward from here?\r\nWho would say that this age of possibility is not for all Americans?\r\n\r\nOur country is and always has been a great and good nation. But the best is\r\nyet to come, if we all do our part.\r\n\r\nThank you, God bless you and God bless the United States of America. Thank\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nWilliam J. Clinton\r\nFebruary 4, 1997\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of the 105th Congress,\r\ndistinguished guests, my fellow Americans:\r\n\r\nI think I should start by saying thanks for inviting me back.\r\n\r\nI come before you tonight with a challenge as great as any in our peacetime\r\nhistory--and a plan of action to meet that challenge, to prepare our\r\npeople for the bold new world of the 21st century.\r\n\r\nWe have much to be thankful for. With four years of growth, we have won\r\nback the basic strength of our economy. With crime and welfare rolls\r\ndeclining, we are winning back our optimism, the enduring faith that we can\r\nmaster any difficulty. With the Cold War receding and global commerce at\r\nrecord levels, we are helping to win an unrivaled peace and prosperity all\r\nacross the world.\r\n\r\nMy fellow Americans, the state of our union is strong, but now we must rise\r\nto the decisive moment, to make a nation and a world better than any we\r\nhave ever known.\r\n\r\nThe new promise of the global economy, the Information Age, unimagined new\r\nwork, life-enhancing technology--all these are ours to seize. That is our\r\nhonor and our challenge. We must be shapers of events, not observers, for\r\nif we do not act, the moment will pass and we will lose the best\r\npossibilities of our future.\r\n\r\nWe face no imminent threat, but we do have an enemy. The enemy of our time\r\nis inaction.\r\n\r\nSo tonight I issue a call to action--action by this Congress, action by\r\nour states, by our people to prepare America for the 21st century; action\r\nto keep our economy and our democracy strong and working for all our\r\npeople; action to strengthen education and harness the forces of technology\r\nand science; action to build stronger families and stronger communities and\r\na safer environment; action to keep America the world's strongest force for\r\npeace, freedom and prosperity; and above all, action to build a more\r\nperfect union here at home.\r\n\r\nThe spirit we bring to our work will make all the difference.\r\n\r\nWe must be committed to the pursuit of opportunity for all Americans,\r\nresponsibility from all Americans in a community of all Americans. And we\r\nmust be committed to a new kind of government: not to solve all our\r\nproblems for us, but to give our people--all our people--the tools they\r\nneed to make the most of their own lives. And we must work together.\r\n\r\nThe people of this nation elected us all. They want us to be partners, not\r\npartisans. They put us all right here in the same boat. They gave us all\r\noars, and they told us to row. Now, here is the direction I believe we\r\nshould take.\r\n\r\nFirst, we must move quickly to complete the unfinished business of our\r\ncountry: to balance the budget, renew our democracy, and finish the job of\r\nwelfare reform.\r\n\r\nOver the last four years we have brought new economic growth by investing\r\nin our people, expanding our exports, cutting our deficits, creating over\r\n11 million new jobs, a four-year record.\r\n\r\nNow we must keep our economy the strongest in the world. We here tonight\r\nhave an historic opportunity. Let this Congress be the Congress that\r\nfinally balances the budget. Thank you.\r\n\r\nIn two days I will propose a detailed plan to balance the budget by 2002.\r\nThis plan will balance the budget and invest in our people while protecting\r\nMedicare, Medicaid, education and the environment. It will balance the\r\nbudget and build on the vice president's efforts to make our government\r\nwork better--even as it costs less.\r\n\r\nIt will balance the budget and provide middle-class tax relief to pay for\r\neducation and health care, to help to raise a child, to buy and sell a\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nBalancing the budget requires only your vote and my signature. It does not\r\nrequire us to rewrite our Constitution. I believe, I believe it is both\r\nunnecessary, unwise to adopt a balanced budget amendment that could cripple\r\nour country in time of economic crisis and force unwanted results such as\r\njudges halting Social Security checks or increasing taxes.\r\n\r\nLet us at least agree we should not pass any measure, no measure should be\r\npassed that threatens Social Security. We don't need, whatever your view on\r\nthat, we all must concede we don't need a constitutional amendment, we need\r\naction. Whatever our differences, we should balance the budget now, and\r\nthen, for the long-term health of our society, we must agree to a\r\nbipartisan process to preserve Social Security and reform Medicare for the\r\nlong run, so that these fundamental programs will be as strong for our\r\nchildren as they are for our parents.\r\n\r\nAnd let me say something that's not in my script tonight. I know this is\r\nnot going to be easy. But I really believe one of the reasons the American\r\npeople gave me a second term was to take the tough decisions in the next\r\nfour years that will carry our country through the next 50 years. I know it\r\nis easier for me than for you to say or do. But another reason I was\r\nelected is to support all of you, without regard to party, to give you what\r\nis necessary to join in these decisions. We owe it to our country and to\r\nour future.\r\n\r\nOur second piece of unfinished business requires us to commit ourselves\r\ntonight, before the eyes of America, to finally enacting bipartisan\r\ncampaign finance reform.\r\n\r\nNow, Senators McCain and Feingold, Representatives Shays and Meehan have\r\nreached across party lines here to craft tough and fair reform. Their\r\nproposal would curb spending, reduce the role of special interests, create\r\na level playing field between challengers and incumbents, and ban\r\ncontributions from non-citizens, all corporate sources, and the other large\r\nsoft-money contributions that both parties receive.\r\n\r\nYou know and I know that this can be delayed, and you know and I know that\r\ndelay will mean the death of reform.\r\n\r\nSo let's set our own deadline. Let's work together to write bipartisan\r\ncampaign finance reform into law and pass McCain-Feingold by the day we\r\ncelebrate the birth of our democracy, July the 4th.\r\n\r\nThere is a third piece of unfinished business. Over the last four years we\r\nmoved a record two and a quarter million people off the welfare roles. Then\r\nlast year Congress enacted landmark welfare reform legislation demanding\r\nthat all able-bodied recipients assume the responsibility of moving from\r\nwelfare to work. Now each and every one of us has to fulfill our\r\nresponsibility, indeed our moral obligation, to make sure that people who\r\nnow must work can work. And now we must act to meet a new goal: two million\r\nmore people off the welfare rolls by the year 2000.\r\n\r\nHere is my plan: Tax credits and other incentives for businesses that hire\r\npeople off welfare; Incentives for job placement firms in states to create\r\nmore jobs for welfare recipients; Training, transportation and child care\r\nto help people go to work. Now I challenge every state--turn those welfare\r\nchecks into private sector paychecks. I challenge every religious\r\ncongregation, every community nonprofit, every business to hire someone off\r\nwelfare. And I'd like to say especially to every employer in our country\r\nwho ever criticized the old welfare system, you can't blame that old system\r\nanymore; we have torn it down. Now, do your part. Give someone on welfare\r\nthe chance to go to work.\r\n\r\nTonight I am pleased to announce that five major corporations--Sprint,\r\nMonsanto, UPS, Burger King and United Airlines--will be the first to join\r\nin a new national effort to marshal America's businesses large and small to\r\ncreate jobs so that people can move from welfare to work.\r\n\r\nWe passed welfare reform. All of you know I believe we were right to do it.\r\nBut no one can walk out of this chamber with a clear conscience unless you\r\nare prepared to finish the job.\r\n\r\nAnd we must join together to do something else, too, something both\r\nRepublican and Democratic governors have asked us to do: to restore basic\r\nhealth and disability benefits when misfortune strikes immigrants who came\r\nto this country legally, who work hard, pay taxes, and obey the law. To do\r\notherwise is simply unworthy of a great nation of immigrants.\r\n\r\nNow, looking ahead, the greatest step of all, the high threshold to the\r\nfuture we must now cross, and my number one priority for the next four\r\nyears, is to ensure that all Americans have the best education in the\r\nworld. Thank you.\r\n\r\nLet's work together to meet these three goals: every eight-year-old must be\r\nable to read, every 12-year-old must be able to log on to the Internet,\r\nevery 18-year-old must be able to go to college, and every adult American\r\nmust be able to keep on learning for a lifetime.\r\n\r\nMy balanced budget makes an unprecedented commitment to these goals--$51\r\nbillion next year--but far more than money is required. I have a plan, a\r\ncall to action for American education based on these 10 principles:\r\n\r\nFirst, a national crusade for education standards--not federal government\r\nstandards, but national standards, representing what all our students must\r\nknow to succeed in the knowledge economy of the 21st century. Every state\r\nand school must shape the curriculum to reflect these standards and train\r\nteachers to lift students up to them. To help schools meet the standards\r\nand measure their progress, we will lead an effort over the next two years\r\nto develop national tests of student achievement in reading and math.\r\n\r\nTonight I issue a challenge to the nation. Every state should adopt high\r\nnational standards, and by 1999, every state should test every 4th grader\r\nin reading and every 8th grader in math to make sure these standards are\r\nmet.\r\n\r\nRaising standards will not be easy, and some of our children will not be\r\nable to meet them at first. The point is not to put our children down, but\r\nto lift them up. Good tests will show us who needs help, what changes in\r\nteaching to make, and which schools need to improve. They can help us end\r\nsocial promotion, for no child should move from grade school to junior high\r\nor junior high to high school until he or she is ready.\r\n\r\nLast month our secretary of education, Dick Riley, and I visited northern\r\nIllinois, where 8th grade students from 20 school districts, in a project\r\naptly called First in the World, took the third International Math and\r\nScience Study.\r\n\r\nThat's a test that reflects the world-class standards our children must\r\nmeet for the new era. And those students in Illinois tied for first in the\r\nworld in science and came in second in math. Two of them, Kristen Tanner\r\nand Chris Getsla, are here tonight along with their teacher, Sue Winski.\r\nThey're up there with the first lady, and they prove that when we aim high\r\nand challenge our students, they will be the best in the world. Let's give\r\nthem a hand. Stand up, please.\r\n\r\nSecond, to have the best schools, we must have the best teachers. Most of\r\nus in this chamber would not be here tonight without the help of those\r\nteachers. I know that I wouldn't be here.\r\n\r\nFor years many of our educators, led by North Carolina's governor, Jim\r\nHunt, and the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, have\r\nworked very hard to establish nationally accepted credentials for\r\nexcellence in teaching.\r\n\r\nJust 500 of these teachers have been certified since 1995. My budget will\r\nenable 100,000 more to seek national certification as master teachers. We\r\nshould reward and recognize our best teachers. And as we reward them, we\r\nshould quickly and fairly remove those few who don't measure up, and we\r\nshould challenge more of our finest young people to consider teaching as a\r\ncareer.\r\n\r\nThird, we must do more to help all our children read. Forty percent--40\r\npercent--of our 8-year-olds cannot read on their own. That's why we have\r\njust launched the America Reads initiative, to build a citizen army of one\r\nmillion volunteer tutors to make sure every child can read independently by\r\nthe end of the 3rd grade. We will use thousands of AmeriCorps volunteers to\r\nmobilize this citizen army. We want at least 100,000 college students to\r\nhelp.\r\n\r\nAnd tonight I'm pleased that 60 college presidents have answered my call,\r\npledging that thousands of their work-study students will serve for one\r\nyear as reading tutors.\r\n\r\nThis is also a challenge to every teacher and every principal.\r\n\r\nYou must use these tutors to help your students read. And it is especially\r\na challenge to our parents. You must read with your children every night.\r\n\r\nThis leads to the fourth principle: Learning begins in the first days of\r\nlife. Scientists are now discovering how young children develop emotionally\r\nand intellectually from their very first days and how important it is for\r\nparents to begin immediately talking, singing, even reading to their\r\ninfants. The first lady has spent years writing about this issue, studying\r\nit. And she and I are going to convene a White House conference on early\r\nlearning and the brain this spring to explore how parents and educators can\r\nbest use these startling new findings.\r\n\r\nWe already know we should start teaching children before they start school.\r\nThat's why this balanced budget expands Head Start to one million children\r\nby 2002. And that is why the vice president and Mrs. Gore will host their\r\nannual family conference this June on what we can do to make sure that\r\nparents are an active part of their children's learning all the way through\r\nschool.\r\n\r\nThey've done a great deal to highlight the importance of family in our\r\nlife, and now they're turning their attention to getting more parents\r\ninvolved in their children's learning all the way through school. I thank\r\nyou, Mr. Vice President, and I thank you especially, Tipper, for what\r\nyou're doing.\r\n\r\nFifth, every state should give parents the power to choose the right public\r\nschool for their children. Their right to choose will foster competition\r\nand innovation that can make public schools better. We should also make it\r\npossible for more parents and teachers to start charter schools, schools\r\nthat set and meet the highest standards and exist only as long as they do.\r\n\r\nOur plan will help America to create 3,000 of these charter schools by the\r\nnext century, nearly seven times as there are in the country today, so that\r\nparents will have even more choices in sending their children to the best\r\nschools.\r\n\r\nSixth, character education must be taught in our schools. We must teach our\r\nchildren to be good citizens. And we must continue to promote order and\r\ndiscipline; supporting communities that introduce school uniforms, impose\r\ncurfews, enforce truancy laws, remove disruptive students from the\r\nclassroom, and have zero tolerance for guns and drugs in schools.\r\n\r\nSeventh, we cannot expect our children to raise themselves up in schools\r\nthat are literally falling down. With the student population at an all-time\r\nhigh, and record numbers of school buildings falling into disrepair, this\r\nhas now become a serious national concern. Therefore, my budget includes a\r\nnew initiative: $5 billion to help communities finance $20 billion in\r\nschool construction over the next four years.\r\n\r\nEighth, we must make the 13th and 14th years of education--at least two\r\nyears of college--just as universal in America by the 21st century as a\r\nhigh school education is today, and we must open the doors of college to\r\nall Americans.\r\n\r\nTo do that, I propose America's Hope Scholarship, based on Georgia's\r\npioneering program--two years of a $1,500 tax credit for college tuition,\r\nenough to pay for the typical community college. I also propose a tax\r\ndeduction of up to $10,000 a year for all tuition after high school, an\r\nexpanded IRA you can withdraw from tax free for education, and the largest\r\nincrease in Pell Grant scholarship in 20 years.\r\n\r\nNow this plan will give most families the ability to pay no taxes on money\r\nthey save for college tuition. I ask you to pass it and give every American\r\nwho works hard the chance to go to college.\r\n\r\nNinth, in the 21st century we must expand the frontiers of learning across\r\na lifetime. All our people, of whatever age, must have the chance to learn\r\nnew skills.\r\n\r\nMost Americans live near a community college. The roads that take them\r\nthere can be paths to a better future. My GI bill for America's workers\r\nwill transform the confusing tangle of federal training programs into a\r\nsimple skill grant to go directly into eligible workers' hands.\r\n\r\nFor too long this bill has been sitting on that desk there, without action.\r\nI ask you to pass it now. Let's give more of our workers the ability to\r\nlearn and to earn for a lifetime.\r\n\r\nTenth, we must bring the power of the Information Age into all our\r\nschools.\r\n\r\nLast year I challenged America to connect every classroom and library to\r\nthe Internet by the year 2000, so that for the first time in our history,\r\nchildren in the most isolated rural town, the most comfortable suburbs, the\r\npoorest inner-city schools will have the same access to the same universe\r\nof knowledge.\r\n\r\nThat is my plan--a call to action for American education. Some may say\r\nthat it is unusual for a president to pay this kind of attention to\r\neducation. Some may say it is simply because the president and his\r\nwonderful wife have been obsessed with this subject for more years than\r\nthey can recall. That is not what is driving these proposals. We must\r\nunderstand the significance of this endeavor.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest sources of our strength throughout the Cold War was a\r\nbipartisan foreign policy. Because our future was at stake, politics\r\nstopped at the water's edge. Now I ask you, and I ask all our nation's\r\ngovernors, I ask parents, teachers and citizens all across America, for a\r\nnew nonpartisan commitment to education, because education is a critical\r\nnational security issue for our future and politics must stop at the\r\nschoolhouse door.\r\n\r\nTo prepare America for the 21st century, we must harness the powerful\r\nforces of science and technology to benefit all Americans. This is the\r\nfirst State of the Union carried live in video over the Internet, but we've\r\nonly begun to spread the benefits of a technology revolution that should\r\nbecome the modern birthright of every citizen.\r\n\r\nOur effort to connect every classroom is just the beginning. Now we should\r\nconnect every hospital to the Internet so that doctors can instantly share\r\ndata about their patients with the best specialists in the field.\r\n\r\nAnd I challenge the private sector tonight to start by connecting every\r\nchildren's hospital as soon as possible so that a child in bed can stay in\r\ntouch with school, family and friends. A sick child need no longer be a\r\nchild alone.\r\n\r\nWe must build the second generation of the Internet so that our leading\r\nuniversities and national laboratories can communicate in speeds a thousand\r\ntimes faster than today to develop new medical treatments, new sources of\r\nenergy, new ways of working together. But we cannot stop there.\r\n\r\nAs the Internet becomes our new town square, a computer in every home: a\r\nteacher of all subjects, a connection to all cultures. This will no longer\r\nbe a dream, but a necessity. And over the next decade, that must be our\r\ngoal.\r\n\r\nWe must continue to explore the heavens, pressing on with the Mars probes\r\nand the International Space Station, both of which will have practical\r\napplications for our everyday living.\r\n\r\nWe must speed the remarkable advances in medical science. The human genome\r\nproject is now decoding the genetic mysteries of life. American scientists\r\nhave discovered genes linked to breast cancer and ovarian cancer and\r\nmedication that stops a stroke in progress and begins to reverse its\r\neffects, and treatments that dramatically lengthen the lives of people with\r\nHIV and AIDS.\r\n\r\nSince I took office, funding for AIDS research at the National Institutes\r\nof Health has increased dramatically to $1.5 billion. With new resources,\r\nNIH will now become the most powerful discovery engine for an AIDS vaccine,\r\nworking with other scientists, to finally end the threat of AIDS. Thank\r\nyou. Remember that every year, every year we move up the discovery of an\r\nAIDS vaccine we'll save millions of lives around the world. We must\r\nreinforce our commitment to medical science.\r\n\r\nTo prepare America for the 21st century we must build stronger families.\r\nOver the past four years the Family and Medical Leave Law has helped\r\nmillions of Americans to take time off to be with their families.\r\n\r\nWith new pressures on people and the way they work and live, I believe we\r\nmust expand family leave so that workers can take time off for teacher\r\nconferences and a child's medical checkup. We should pass flex time so\r\nworkers can choose to be paid for overtime in income or trade it in for\r\ntime off to be with their families.\r\n\r\nWe must continue--we must continue, step by step, to give more families\r\naccess to affordable quality health care. Forty million Americans still\r\nlack health insurance. Ten million children still lack health insurance.\r\nEighty percent of them have working parents who pay taxes. That is wrong.\r\n\r\nMy--my balanced budget will extend health coverage to up to 5 million of\r\nthose children. Since nearly half of all children who lose their insurance\r\ndo so because their parents lose or change a job, my budget will also\r\nensure that people who temporarily lose their jobs can still afford to keep\r\ntheir health insurance. No child should be without a doctor just because a\r\nparent is without a job.\r\n\r\nMy Medicare plan modernizes Medicare, increases the life of the trust fund\r\nto 10 years, provides support for respite care for the many families with\r\nloved ones afflicted with Alzheimer's, and, for the first time, it would\r\nfully pay for annual mammograms.\r\n\r\nJust as we ended drive-through deliveries of babies last year, we must now\r\nend the dangerous and demeaning practice of forcing women home from the\r\nhospital only hours after a mastectomy.\r\n\r\nI ask your support for bipartisan legislation to guarantee that a woman can\r\nstay in the hospital for 48 hours after a mastectomy. With us tonight is\r\nDr. Kristen Zarfos, a Connecticut surgeon whose outrage at this practice\r\nspurred a national movement and inspired this legislation. I'd like her to\r\nstand so we can thank her for her efforts. Dr. Zarfos, thank you.\r\n\r\nIn the last four years, we have increased child support collections by 50\r\npercent. Now we should go further and do better by making it a felony for\r\nany parent to cross a state line in an attempt to flee from this, his or\r\nher most sacred obligation.\r\n\r\nFinally, we must also protect our children by standing firm in our\r\ndetermination to ban the advertising and marketing of cigarettes that\r\nendanger their lives.\r\n\r\nTo prepare America for the 21st century, we must build stronger\r\ncommunities. We should start with safe streets. Serious crime has dropped\r\nfive years in a row. The key has been community policing. We must finish\r\nthe job of putting 100,000 community police on the streets of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nWe should pass the Victims' Rights Amendment to the Constitution, and I ask\r\nyou to mount a full-scale assault on juvenile crime, with legislation that\r\ndeclares war on gangs with new prosecutors and tougher penalties, extends\r\nthe Brady bill so violent teen criminals will not be able to buy handguns,\r\nrequires child safety locks on handguns to prevent unauthorized use, and\r\nhelps to keep our schools open after hours, on weekends and in the summer\r\nso our young people will have someplace to go and something to say yes to.\r\n\r\nThis balanced budget includes the largest anti-drug effort ever--to stop\r\ndrugs at their source; punish those who push them; and teach our young\r\npeople that drugs are wrong, drugs are illegal, and drugs will kill them. I\r\nhope you will support it.\r\n\r\nOur growing economy has helped to revive poor urban and rural\r\nneighborhoods, but we must do more to empower them to create the conditions\r\nin which all families can flourish and to create jobs through investment by\r\nbusiness and loans by banks.\r\n\r\nWe should double the number of empowerment zones. They've already brought\r\nso much hope to communities like Detroit, where the unemployment rate has\r\nbeen cut in half in four years. We should restore contaminated urban land\r\nand buildings to constructive use. We should expand the network of\r\ncommunity development banks.\r\n\r\nAnd together, we must pledge tonight that we will use this empowerment\r\napproach, including private sector tax incentives, to renew our capital\r\ncity so that Washington is a great place to work and live--and once again\r\nthe proud face America shows the world!\r\n\r\nWe must protect our environment in every community. In the last four years,\r\nwe cleaned up 250 toxic waste sites, as many as in the previous 12. Now we\r\nshould clean up 500 more so that our children grow up next to parks, not\r\npoison. I urge to pass my proposal to make big polluters live by a simple\r\nrule: If you pollute our environment, you should pay to clean it up.\r\n\r\nIn the last four years, we strengthened our nation's safe food and clean\r\ndrinking water laws; we protected some of America's rarest, most beautiful\r\nland in Utah's Red Rocks region; created three new national parks in the\r\nCalifornia desert; and began to restore the Florida Everglades.\r\n\r\nNow we must be as vigilant with our rivers as we are with our lands.\r\nTonight I announce that this year I will designate 10 American Heritage\r\nRivers to help communities alongside them revitalize their waterfronts and\r\nclean up pollution in the rivers, proving once again that we can grow the\r\neconomy as we protect the environment.\r\n\r\nWe must also protect our global environment, working to ban the worst toxic\r\nchemicals and to reduce the greenhouse gases that challenge our health even\r\nas they change our climate.\r\n\r\nNow, we all know that in all of our communities some of our children simply\r\ndon't have what they need to grow and learn in their own homes or schools\r\nor neighborhoods. And that means the rest of us must do more, for they are\r\nour children, too. That's why President Bush, General Colin Powell, former\r\nHousing Secretary Henry Cisneros will join the vice president and me to\r\nlead the President's Summit of Service in Philadelphia in April.\r\n\r\nOur national service program, AmeriCorps, has already helped 70,000 young\r\npeople to work their way through college as they serve America. Now we\r\nintend to mobilize millions of Americans to serve in thousands of ways.\r\nCitizen service is an American responsibility which all Americans should\r\nembrace. And I ask your support for that endeavor.\r\n\r\nI'd like to make just one last point about our national community. Our\r\neconomy is measured in numbers and statistics. And it's very important. But\r\nthe enduring worth of our nation lies in our shared values and our soaring\r\nspirit. So instead of cutting back on our modest efforts to support the\r\narts and humanities I believe we should stand by them and challenge our\r\nartists, musicians, and writers, challenge our museums, libraries, and\r\ntheaters.\r\n\r\nWe should challenge all Americans in the arts and humanities to join with\r\ntheir fellow citizens to make the year 2000 a national celebration of the\r\nAmerican spirit in every community, a celebration of our common culture in\r\nthe century that is past and in the new one to come in a new millennium so\r\nthat we can remain the world's beacon not only of liberty but of creativity\r\nlong after the fireworks have faded.\r\n\r\nTo prepare America for the 21st century we must master the forces of change\r\nin the world and keep American leadership strong and sure for an uncharted\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nFifty years ago, a farsighted America led in creating the institutions that\r\nsecured victory in the Cold War and built a growing world economy. As a\r\nresult, today more people than ever embrace our ideals and share our\r\ninterests. Already we have dismantled many of the blocks and barriers that\r\ndivided our parents' world. For the first time, more people live under\r\ndemocracy than dictatorship including every nation in our own hemisphere\r\nbut one, and its day, too, will come.\r\n\r\nNow we stand at another moment of change and choice, and another time to be\r\nfarsighted, to bring America 50 more years of security and prosperity.\r\n\r\nIn this endeavor, our first task is to help to build for the very first\r\ntime an undivided, democratic Europe. When Europe is stable, prosperous,\r\nand at peace, America is more secure.\r\n\r\nTo that end, we must expand NATO by 1999, so that countries that were once\r\nour adversaries can become our allies. At the special NATO summit this\r\nsummer, that is what we will begin to do. We must strengthen NATO's\r\nPartnership for Peace with non-member allies. And we must build a stable\r\npartnership between NATO and a democratic Russia.\r\n\r\nAn expanded NATO is good for America, and a Europe in which all democracies\r\ndefine their future not in terms of what they can do to each other, but in\r\nterms of what they can do together for the good of all--that kind of\r\nEurope is good for America.\r\n\r\nSecond, America must look to the East no less than to the West.\r\n\r\nOur security demands it. Americans fought three wars in Asia in this\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nOur prosperity requires it. More than 2 million American jobs depend upon\r\ntrade with Asia. There, too, we are helping to shape an Asia Pacific\r\ncommunity of cooperation, not conflict.\r\n\r\nLet our--let our progress there not mask the peril that remains. Together\r\nwith South Korea, we must advance peace talks with North Korea and bridge\r\nthe Cold War's last divide. And I call on Congress to fund our share of the\r\nagreement under which North Korea must continue to freeze and then\r\ndismantle its nuclear weapons program.\r\n\r\nWe must pursue a deeper dialogue with China for the sake of our interests\r\nand our ideals. An isolated China is not good for America. A China playing\r\nits proper role in the world is. I will go to China, and I have invited\r\nChina's president to come here, not because we agree on everything, but\r\nbecause engaging China is the best way to work on our common challenges,\r\nlike ending nuclear testing, and to deal frankly with our fundamental\r\ndifferences, like human rights.\r\n\r\nThe American people must prosper in the global economy. We've worked hard\r\nto tear down trade barriers abroad so that we can create good jobs at home.\r\nI'm proud to say that today America is once again the most competitive\r\nnation and the No. 1 exporter in the world.\r\n\r\nNow we must act to expand our exports, especially to Asia and Latin\r\nAmerica, two of the fastest-growing regions on earth, or be left behind as\r\nthese emerging economies forge new ties with other nations. That is why we\r\nneed the authority now to conclude new trade agreements that open markets\r\nto our goods and services even as we preserve our values.\r\n\r\nWe need not shrink from the challenge of the global economy. After all, we\r\nhave the best workers and the best products. In a truly open market, we can\r\nout-compete anyone, anywhere on earth.\r\n\r\nBut this is about more than economics. By expanding trade, we can advance\r\nthe cause of freedom and democracy around the world. There is no better\r\nexample of this truth than Latin America where democracy and open markets\r\nare on the march together. That is why I will visit there in the spring to\r\nreinforce our important ties.\r\n\r\nWe should all be proud that America led the effort to rescue our neighbor,\r\nMexico, from its economic crisis. And we should all be proud that last\r\nmonth Mexico repaid the United States, three full years ahead of schedule,\r\nwith half a billion dollar profit to us.\r\n\r\nAmerica must continue to be an unrelenting force for peace. From the Middle\r\nEast to Haiti, from Northern Ireland to Africa, taking reasonable risks for\r\npeace keeps us from being drawn into far more costly conflicts later. With\r\nAmerican leadership, the killing has stopped in Bosnia. Now the habits of\r\npeace must take hold.\r\n\r\nThe new NATO force will allow reconstruction and reconciliation to\r\naccelerate. Tonight I ask Congress to continue its strong support of our\r\ntroops. They are doing a remarkable job there for America, and America must\r\ndo right by them.\r\n\r\nFifth, we must move strongly against new threats to our security. In the\r\npast four years, we agreed to ban--we led the way to a worldwide agreement\r\nto ban nuclear testing.\r\n\r\nWith Russia, we dramatically cut nuclear arsenals and we stopped targeting\r\neach other's citizens. We are acting to prevent nuclear materials from\r\nfalling into the wrong hands, and to rid the world of land mines.\r\n\r\nWe are working with other nations with renewed intensity to fight drug\r\ntraffickers and to stop terrorists before they act and hold them fully\r\naccountable if they do.\r\n\r\nNow we must rise to a new test of leadership--ratifying the Chemical\r\nWeapons Convention. Make no mistake about it, it will make our troops safer\r\nfrom chemical attack. It will help us to fight terrorism. We have no more\r\nimportant obligations, especially in the wake of what we now know about the\r\nGulf War.\r\n\r\nThis treaty has been bipartisan from the beginning, supported by Republican\r\nand Democratic administrations, and Republican and Democratic members of\r\nCongress, and already approved by 68 nations. But if we do not act by April\r\nthe 29th, when this convention goes into force--with or without us--we\r\nwill lose the chance to have Americans leading and enforcing this effort.\r\nTogether we must make the Chemical Weapons Convention law so that at last\r\nwe can begin to outlaw poisoned gas from the earth.\r\n\r\nFinally, we must have the tools to meet all these challenges. We must\r\nmaintain a strong and ready military. We must increase funding for weapons\r\nmodernization by the year 2000. And we must take good care of our men and\r\nwomen in uniform. They are the world's finest.\r\n\r\nWe must also renew our commitment to America's diplomacy and pay our debts\r\nand dues to international financial institutions like the World Bank--and\r\nto a reforming United Nations. Every dollar--every dollar we devote to\r\npreventing conflicts, to promoting democracy, to stopping the spread of\r\ndisease and starvation brings a sure return in security and savings. Yet\r\ninternational affairs spending today is just 1 percent of the federal\r\nbudget, a small fraction of what America invested in diplomacy to choose\r\nleadership over escapism at the start of the cold war.\r\n\r\nIf America is to continue to lead the world, we here who lead America\r\nsimply must find the will to pay our way. A farsighted America moved the\r\nworld to a better place over these last 50 years. And so it can be for\r\nanother 50 years. But a shortsighted America will soon find its words\r\nfalling on deaf ears all around the world.\r\n\r\nAlmost exactly 50 years ago in the first winter of the Cold War President\r\nTruman stood before a Republican Congress and called upon our country to\r\nmeet its responsibilities of leadership. This was his warning. He said, \"If\r\nwe falter, we may endanger the peace of the world, and we shall surely\r\nendanger the welfare of this nation.\"\r\n\r\nThat Congress, led by Republicans like Senator Arthur Vandenburg, answered\r\nPresident Truman's call. Together, they made the commitments that\r\nstrengthened our country for 50 years. Now let us do the same. Let us do\r\nwhat it takes to remain the indispensable nation, to keep America strong,\r\nsecure and prosperous for another 50 years.\r\n\r\nIn the end, more than anything else, our world leadership grows out of the\r\npower of our example here at home, out of our ability to remain strong as\r\none America.\r\n\r\nAll over the world people are being torn asunder by racial, ethnic and\r\nreligious conflicts that fuel fanaticism and terror. We are the world's\r\nmost diverse democracy, and the world looks to us to show that it is\r\npossible to live and advance together across those kinds of differences.\r\nAmerica has always been a nation of immigrants.\r\n\r\nFrom the start, a steady stream of people in search of freedom and\r\nopportunity have left their own lands to make this land their home. We\r\nstarted as an experiment in democracy fueled by Europeans. We have grown\r\ninto an experiment in democratic diversity fueled by openness and promise.\r\n\r\nMy fellow Americans, we must never, ever believe that our diversity is a\r\nweakness; it is our greatest strength.\r\n\r\nAmericans speak every language, know every country. People on every\r\ncontinent can look to us and see the reflection of their own great\r\npotential, and they always will, as long as we strive to give all our\r\ncitizens, whatever their background, an opportunity to achieve their own\r\ngreatness.\r\n\r\nWe're not there yet. We still see evidence of a biting bigotry and\r\nintolerance in ugly words and awful violence, in burned churches and bombed\r\nbuildings. We must fight against this in our country and in our hearts.\r\n\r\nJust a few days before my second inauguration, one of our country's\r\nbest-known pastors, Reverend Robert Schuller, suggested that I read Isaiah\r\n58:12. Here's what it says: \"Thou shalt raise up the foundations of many\r\ngenerations, and thou shalt be called the repairer of the breach, the\r\nrestorer of paths to dwell in.\"\r\n\r\nI placed my hand on that verse when I took the oath of office, on behalf of\r\nall Americans, for no matter what our differences in our faiths, our\r\nbackgrounds, our politics, we must all be repairers of the breach.\r\n\r\nI want to say a word about two other Americans who show us how. Congressman\r\nFrank Tejeda was buried yesterday, a proud American whose family came from\r\nMexico. He was only 51 years old. He was awarded the Silver Star, the\r\nBronze Star and the Purple Heart fighting for his country in Vietnam. And\r\nhe went on to serve Texas and America fighting for our future here in this\r\nchamber.\r\n\r\nWe are grateful for his service and honored that his mother, Lillie Tejeda,\r\nand his sister, Mary Alice, have come from Texas to be with us here\r\ntonight. And we welcome you. Thank you.\r\n\r\nGary Locke, the newly-elected governor of Washington state, is the first\r\nChinese-American governor in the history of our country. He's the proud son\r\nof two of the millions of Asian American immigrants who strengthened\r\nAmerica with their hard work, family values and good citizenship.\r\n\r\nHe represents the future we can all achieve. Thank you, governor, for being\r\nhere. Please stand up.\r\n\r\nReverend Schuller, Congressman Tejeda, Governor Locke, along with Kristen\r\nTanner and Chris Getsla, Sue Winski and Dr. Kristen Zarfos--they're all\r\nAmericans from different roots whose lives reflect the best of what we can\r\nbecome when we are one America.\r\n\r\nWe may not share a common past, but we surely do share a common future.\r\nBuilding one America is our most important mission, the foundation for many\r\ngenerations of every other strength we must build for this new century.\r\nMoney cannot buy it, power cannot compel it, technology cannot create it.\r\nIt can only come from the human spirit.\r\n\r\nAmerica is far more than a place; it is an idea--the most powerful idea in\r\nthe history of nations, and all of us in this chamber, we are now the\r\nbearers of that idea, leading a great people into a new world.\r\n\r\nA child born tonight will have almost no memory of the 20th century.\r\nEverything that child will know about America will be because of what we do\r\nnow to build a new century. We don't have a moment to waste.\r\n\r\nTomorrow there will be just over 1,000 days until the year 2000. One\r\nthousand days to prepare our people. One thousand days to work together.\r\nOne thousand days to build a bridge to a land of new promise.\r\n\r\nMy fellow Americans, we have work to do. Let us seize those days and the\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThank you. God bless you. And God bless America.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nWilliam J. Clinton\r\nJanuary 27, 1998\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of the 105th Congress,\r\ndistinguished guests, my fellow Americans:\r\n\r\nSince the last time we met in this chamber, America has lost two patriots\r\nand fine public servants. Though they sat on opposite sides of the aisle,\r\nRepresentatives Walter Capps and Sonny Bono shared a deep love for this\r\nHouse and an unshakable commitment to improving the lives of all our\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nIn the past few weeks, they have both been eulogized. Tonight, I think we\r\nshould begin by sending a message to their families and their friends that\r\nwe celebrate their lives, and give thanks for their service to our nation.\r\n\r\nFor 209 years, it has been the president's duty to report to you on the\r\nstate of the union. Because of the hard work and high purpose of the\r\nAmerican people, these are good times for America. We have more than 14\r\nmillion new jobs, the lowest unemployment in 24 years, the lowest core\r\ninflation in 30 years, incomes are rising and we have the highest home\r\nownership in history. Crime has dropped for a record five years in a row,\r\nand the welfare rolls are at their lowest levels in 27 years. Our\r\nleadership in the world is unrivaled. Ladies and gentlemen, the state of\r\nour union is strong.\r\n\r\nBut with barely 700 days left in the 20th century, this is not a time to\r\nrest. It is a time to build--to build the America within reach, an America\r\nwhere everybody has a chance to get ahead, with hard work; where every\r\ncitizen can live in a safe community; where families are strong, schools\r\nare good, and all our young people can go on to college; an America where\r\nscientists find cures for diseases from diabetes to Alzheimer's to AIDS; an\r\nAmerica where every child can stretch a hand across a keyboard and reach\r\nevery book ever written, every painting ever painted, every symphony ever\r\ncomposed; where government provides opportunity and citizens honor the\r\nresponsibility to give something back to their communities; an America\r\nwhich leads the world to new heights of peace and prosperity.\r\n\r\nThis is the America we have begun to build. This is the America we can\r\nleave to our children--if we join together to finish the work at hand. Let\r\nus strengthen our nation for the 21st century.\r\n\r\nRarely have Americans lived through so much change in so many ways in so\r\nshort a time. Quietly, but with gathering force, the ground has shifted\r\nbeneath our feet as we have moved into an information age, a global\r\neconomy, a truly new world.\r\n\r\nFor five years now, we have met the challenge of these changes as Americans\r\nhave at every turning point in our history, by renewing the very idea of\r\nAmerica, widening the circle of opportunity, deepening the meaning of our\r\nfreedom, forging a more perfect union. We shaped a new kind of government\r\nfor the information age. I thank the vice president for his leadership, and\r\nthe Congress for its support, in building a government that is leaner, more\r\nflexible, a catalyst for new ideas, and most of all, a government that\r\ngives the American people the tools they need to make the most of their own\r\nlives.\r\n\r\nWe have moved past the sterile debate between those who say government is\r\nthe enemy and those who say government is the answer. My fellow Americans,\r\nwe have found a third way. We have the smallest government in 35 years, but\r\na more progressive one. We have a smaller government but a stronger\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nWe are moving steadily toward a an even stronger America in the 21st\r\ncentury--an economy that offers opportunity, a society rooted in\r\nresponsibility, and a nation that lives as a community.\r\n\r\nFirst, Americans in this chamber and across this nation have pursued a new\r\nstrategy for prosperity: fiscal discipline to cut interest rates and spur\r\ngrowth; investments in education and skills, in science and technology and\r\ntransportation, to prepare our people for the new economy; new markets for\r\nAmerican products and American workers.\r\n\r\nWhen I took office, the deficit for 1998 was projected to be $357 billion,\r\nand heading higher. This year, our deficit is projected to be $10 billion,\r\nand heading lower.\r\n\r\nFor three decades, six presidents have come before you to warn of the\r\ndamage deficits pose to our nation. Tonight, I come before you to announce\r\nthat the federal deficit, once so incomprehensively large that it had 11\r\nzeros, will be simply zero.\r\n\r\nI will submit to Congress, for 1999, the first balanced budget in 30\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nAnd if we hold fast to fiscal discipline, we may balance the budget this\r\nyear--four years ahead of schedule.\r\n\r\nYou can all be proud of that, because turning a sea of red ink into black\r\nis no miracle. It is the product of hard work by the American people, and\r\nof two visionary actions in Congress: The courageous vote in 1993 that led\r\nto a cut in the deficit of 90 percent and the truly historic bipartisan\r\nbalanced budget agreement passed by this Congress.\r\n\r\nHere's the really good news: If we maintain our resolve, we will produce\r\nbalanced budgets as far as the eye can see.\r\n\r\nWe must not go back to unwise spending or untargeted tax cuts that risk\r\nreopening the deficit. Last year, together, we enacted targeted tax cuts so\r\nthat the typical middle class family will now have the lowest tax rates in\r\n20 years.\r\n\r\nMy plan to balance the budget next year includes both new investments and\r\nnew tax cuts targeted to the needs of working families: for education, for\r\nchild care, for the environment.\r\n\r\nBut whether the issue is tax cuts or spending, I ask all of you to meet\r\nthis test: approve only those priorities that can actually be accomplished\r\nwithout adding a dime to the deficit.\r\n\r\nNow, if we balance the budget for next year, it is projected that we'll\r\nthen have a sizeable surplus in the years that immediately follow. What\r\nshould we do with this projected surplus?\r\n\r\nI have a simple four-word answer: Save Social Security first.\r\n\r\nTonight, I propose that we reserve 100 percent of the surplus--that's\r\nevery penny of any surplus--until we have taken all the necessary measures\r\nto strengthen the Social Security system for the 21st century.\r\n\r\nLet us say--let us say to all Americans watching tonight, whether you're\r\n70 or 50, or whether you just started paying into the system, Social\r\nSecurity will be there when you need it. Let us make this commitment:\r\nSocial Security first. Let's do that--together.\r\n\r\nI also want to say that all the American people who are watching us tonight\r\nshould be invited to join in this discussion, in facing these issues\r\nsquarely and forming a true consensus on how we should proceed. We'll start\r\nby conducting nonpartisan forums in every region of the country, and I hope\r\nthat lawmakers of both parties will participate. We'll hold a White House\r\nconference on Social Security in December. And one year from now, I will\r\nconvene the leaders of Congress to craft historic bipartisan legislation to\r\nachieve a landmark for our generation, a Social Security system that is\r\nstrong in the 21st century.\r\n\r\nIn an economy that honors opportunity, all Americans must be able to reap\r\nthe rewards of prosperity. Because these times are good, we can afford to\r\ntake one simple, sensible step to help millions of workers struggling to\r\nprovide for their families. We should raise the minimum wage.\r\n\r\nThe information age is first and foremost an education age, in which\r\neducation will start at birth and continue throughout a lifetime. Last\r\nyear, from this podium, I said that education has to be our highest\r\npriority. I laid out a 10-point plan to move us forward, and urged all of\r\nus to let politics stop at the schoolhouse door.\r\n\r\nSince then, this Congress--across party lines--and the American people\r\nhave responded, in the most important year for education in a generation--\r\nexpanding public school choice, opening the way to 3,000 charter schools,\r\nworking to connect every classroom in the country to the information\r\nsuperhighway, committing to expand Head Start to a million children,\r\nlaunching America Reads, sending literally thousands of college students\r\ninto our elementary schools to make sure all our 8-year-olds can read.\r\n\r\nLast year I proposed--and you passed--220,000 new Pell Grant scholarships\r\nfor deserving students. Student loans, already less expensive and easier to\r\nrepay--now you get to deduct the interest. Families all over America now can\r\nput their savings into new, tax-free education IRAs.\r\n\r\nAnd this year, for the first two years of college, families will get a\r\n$1500 tax credit--a Hope Scholarship that will cover the cost of most\r\ncommunity college tuition. And for junior and senior year, graduate school,\r\nand job training, there is a lifetime learning credit. You did that, and\r\nyou should be very proud of it.\r\n\r\nAnd because of these actions, I have something to say to every family\r\nlistening to us tonight: your children can go on to college. If you know a\r\nchild from a poor family, tell her not to give up, she can go on to\r\ncollege. If you know a young couple struggling with bills, worried they\r\nwon't be able to send their children to college, tell them not to give up,\r\ntheir children can go on to college. If you know somebody who's caught in a\r\ndead-end job and afraid he can't afford the classes necessary to get better\r\njobs for the rest of his life, tell him not to give up, he can go on to\r\ncollege.\r\n\r\nBecause of the things that have been done, we can make college as universal\r\nin the 21st century as high school is today. And, my friends, that will\r\nchange the face and future of America.\r\n\r\nWe have opened wide the doors of the world's best system of higher\r\neducation. Now we must make our public elementary and secondary schools the\r\nworld's best as well--by raising standards, raising expectations and raising\r\naccountability.\r\n\r\nThanks to the actions of this Congress last year, we will soon have, for\r\nthe very first time, a voluntary national test based on national standards\r\nin fourth grade reading and eighth grade math.\r\n\r\nParents have a right to know whether their children are mastering the\r\nbasics. And every parent already knows the key; good teachers and small\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\nTonight, I propose the first ever national effort to reduce class size in\r\nthe early grades. My balanced budget will help to hire a hundred thousand\r\nnew teachers who have passed the state competency tests. Now with these\r\nteachers--listen--with these teachers, we will actually be able to reduce\r\nclass size in the first, second and third grades to an average of 18\r\nstudents a class all across America.\r\n\r\nNow, if I've got the math right, more teachers teaching smaller classes\r\nrequires more classrooms. So I also propose a school construction tax cut\r\nto help communities modernize or build 5,000 schools.\r\n\r\nWe must also demand greater accountability. When we promote a child from\r\ngrade to grade who hasn't mastered the work, we don't do that child any\r\nfavors. It is time to end social promotion in America's schools.\r\n\r\nLast year, in Chicago, they made that decision--not to hold our children\r\nback, but to lift them up. Chicago stopped social promotion and started\r\nmandatory summer school to help students who are behind to catch up.\r\n\r\nI propose to help other communities follow Chicago's lead. Let's say to\r\nthem stop promoting children who don't learn, and we will give you the\r\ntools to make sure they do.\r\n\r\nI also ask this Congress to support our efforts to enlist colleges and\r\nuniversities to reach out to disadvantaged children starting in the sixth\r\ngrade so that they can get the guidance and hope they need so they can know\r\nthat they, too, will be able to go on to college.\r\n\r\nAs we enter the 21st century, the global economy requires us to seek\r\nopportunity not just at home, but in all the markets of the world. We must\r\nshape this global economy, not shrink from it.\r\n\r\nIn the last five years, we have led the way in opening new markets, with\r\n240 trade agreements that remove foreign barriers to products bearing the\r\nproud stamp, \"Made in the USA.\" Today, record high exports account for\r\nfully one-third of our economic growth. I want to keep them going, because\r\nthat's the way to keep America growing and to advance a safer, more stable\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nNow, all of you know, whatever your views are, that I think this is a great\r\nopportunity for America. I know there is opposition to more comprehensive\r\ntrade agreements. I have listened carefully, and I believe that the\r\nopposition is rooted in two fears: first, that our trading partners will\r\nhave lower environmental and labor standards, which will give them an\r\nunfair advantage in our market and do their own people no favors, even if\r\nthere's more business; and second, that if we have more trade, more of our\r\nworkers will lose their jobs and have to start over.\r\n\r\nI think we should seek to advance worker and environmental standards around\r\nthe world. It should--I have made it abundantly clear that it should be a\r\npart of our trade agenda, but we cannot influence other countries'\r\ndecisions if we send them a message that we're backing away from trade with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThis year I will send legislation to Congress, and ask other nations to\r\njoin us, to fight the most intolerable labor practice of all-abusive child\r\nlabor.\r\n\r\nWe should also offer help and hope to those Americans temporarily left\r\nbehind with the global marketplace or by the march of technology, which may\r\nhave nothing to do with trade. That's why we have more than doubled funding\r\nfor training dislocated workers since 1993. And if my new budget is\r\nadopted, we will triple funding. That's why we must do more, and more\r\nquickly, to help workers who lose their jobs for whatever reason.\r\n\r\nYou know, we help communities in a special way when their military base\r\ncloses. We ought to help them in the same way if their factory closes.\r\nAgain, I ask the Congress to continue its bipartisan work to consolidate\r\nthe tangle of training programs we have today into one single GI Bill for\r\nWorkers, a simple skills grant so people can, on their own, move quickly to\r\nnew jobs, to higher incomes and brighter futures.\r\n\r\nNow, we all know in every way in life change is not always easy, but we\r\nhave to decide whether we're going to try to hold it back and hide from it,\r\nor reap its benefits. And remember the big picture here: while we've been\r\nentering into hundreds of new trade agreements, we've been creating\r\nmillions of new jobs. So this year we will forge new partnerships with\r\nLatin America, Asia and Europe, and we should pass the new African Trade\r\nAct. It has bipartisan support.\r\n\r\nI will also renew my request for the fast-track negotiating authority\r\nnecessary to open more new markets, created more new jobs, which every\r\npresident has had for two decades.\r\n\r\nYou know, whether we like it or not, in ways that are mostly positive, the\r\nworld's economies are more and more interconnected and interdependent.\r\nToday, an economic crisis anywhere can affect economies everywhere. Recent\r\nmonths have brought serious financial problems to Thailand, Indonesia,\r\nSouth Korea and beyond.\r\n\r\nNow why should Americans be concerned about this?\r\n\r\nFirst, these countries are our customers. If they sink into recession, they\r\nwon't be able to buy the goods we'd like to sell them.\r\n\r\nSecond, they're also our competitors, so if their currencies lose their\r\nvalue and go down, then the price of their goods will drop, flooding our\r\nmarket and others with much cheaper goods, which makes it a lot tougher for\r\nour people to compete.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, they are our strategic partners. Their stability bolsters our\r\nsecurity.\r\n\r\nThe American economy remains sound and strong, and I want to keep it that\r\nway. But because the turmoil in Asia will have an impact on all the world's\r\neconomies, including ours, making that negative impact as small as possible\r\nis the right thing to do for America, and the right thing to do for a safer\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nOur policy is clear: no nation can recover if it does not reform itself,\r\nbut when nations are willing to undertake serious economic reform, we\r\nshould help them do it. So I call on Congress to renew America's commitment\r\nto the International Monetary Fund.\r\n\r\nAnd I think we should say to all the people we're trying to represent here,\r\nthat preparing for a far off storm that may reach our shores is far wiser\r\nthan ignoring the thunder 'til the clouds are just overhead.\r\n\r\nA strong nation rests on the rock of responsibility. A society rooted in\r\nresponsibility must first promote the value of work, not welfare. We could\r\nbe proud that after decades of finger-pointing and failure, together we\r\nended the old welfare system. And we're now replacing welfare checks with\r\npaychecks.\r\n\r\nLast year, after a record four-year decline in welfare rolls I challenged\r\nour nation to move two million more Americans off welfare by the year 2000.\r\nI'm pleased to report we have also met that goal two full years ahead of\r\nschedule.\r\n\r\nThis is a grand achievement, the sum of many acts of individual courage,\r\npersistence and hope.\r\n\r\nFor 13 years, Elaine Kinslow of Indianapolis, Indiana was on and off\r\nwelfare. Today she's a dispatcher with a van company. She's saved enough\r\nmoney to move her family into a good neighborhood. And she's helping other\r\nwelfare recipients go to work.\r\n\r\nElaine Kinslow and all those like her are the real heroes of the welfare\r\nrevolution. There are millions like her all across America, and I am happy\r\nshe could join the first lady tonight. Elaine, we're very proud of you.\r\nPlease stand up.\r\n\r\nWe still have a lot more to do, all of us, to make welfare reform a\r\nsuccess; providing child care, helping families move closer to available\r\njobs, challenging more companies to join our Welfare to Work Partnership,\r\nincreasing child-support collections from deadbeat parents who have a duty\r\nto support their own children. I also want to thank Congress for restoring\r\nsome of the benefits to immigrants who are here legally and working hard.\r\nAnd I hope you will finish that job this year.\r\n\r\nWe have to make it possible for all hard-working families to meet their\r\nmost important responsibilities. Two years ago, we helped guarantee that\r\nAmericans can keep their health insurance when they changed jobs. Last\r\nyear, we extended health care to up to 5 million children. This year, I\r\nchallenge Congress to take the next historic steps. A hundred and sixty\r\nmillion of our fellow citizens are in managed care plans. These plans save\r\nmoney, and they can improve care. But medical decisions ought to be made by\r\nmedical doctors, not insurance company accountants.\r\n\r\nI urge this Congress to reach across the aisle and write into law a\r\nconsumer bill of rights that says this: You have the right to know all your\r\nmedical options, not just the cheapest. You have the right to choose the\r\ndoctor you want for the care you need. You have the right to emergency room\r\ncare wherever and whenever you need it. You have the right to keep your\r\nmedical records confidential.\r\n\r\nNow, traditional care or managed care, every American deserves quality\r\ncare. Millions of Americans between the ages of 55 and 65 have lost their\r\nhealth insurance. Some are retired. Some are laid off. Some lose their\r\ncoverage when their spouses retire. After a lifetime of work, they're left\r\nwith nowhere to turn.\r\n\r\nSo I ask the Congress, let these hard-working Americans buy into the\r\nMedicare system. It won't add a dime to the deficit, but the peace of mind\r\nit will provide will be priceless.\r\n\r\nNext, we must help parents protect their children from the gravest health\r\nthreat that they face: an epidemic of teen smoking spread by multimillion\r\ndollar marketing campaigns. I challenge Congress. Let's pass bipartisan,\r\ncomprehensive legislation that will improve public health, protect our\r\ntobacco farmers, and change the way tobacco companies do business forever.\r\n\r\nLet's do what it takes to bring teen smoking down. Let's raise the price of\r\ncigarettes by up to $1.50 a pack over the next 10 years, with penalties on\r\nthe tobacco industry if it keeps marketing to our children.\r\n\r\nNow tomorrow, like every day, 3,000 children will start smoking, and a\r\nthousand will die early as a result. Let this Congress be remembered as the\r\nCongress that saved their lives.\r\n\r\nIn the new economy, most parents work harder than ever. They face a\r\nconstant struggle to balance their obligations to be good workers, and\r\ntheir even more important obligations to be good parents.\r\n\r\nThe Family and Medical Leave Act was the very first bill I was privileged\r\nto sign into law as president in 1993. Since then, about 15 million people\r\nhave taken advantage of it, and I've met a lot of them all across this\r\ncountry. I ask you to extend the law to cover 10 million more workers, and\r\nto give parents time off when they have to go see their children's teachers\r\nor take them to the doctor.\r\n\r\nChild care is the next frontier we must face to enable people to succeed at\r\nhome and at work. Last year, I co-hosted the very first White House\r\nconference on child care with one of our foremost experts, America's first\r\nlady. From all corners of America, we heard the same message--without regard\r\nto region or income or political affiliation--we've got to raise the quality\r\nof child care, we've got to make it safer, we've got to make it more\r\naffordable.\r\n\r\nSo here's my plan: Help families to pay for child care for a million more\r\nchildren; scholarships and background checks for child-care workers, and a\r\nnew emphasis on early learning; tax credits for businesses that provide\r\nchild care for their employees; and a larger child-care tax credit for\r\nworking families.\r\n\r\nNow, if you pass my plan, what this means is that a family of four with an\r\nincome of $35,000 and high child-care costs will no longer pay a single\r\npenny of federal income tax.\r\n\r\nYou know, I think this is such a big issue with me because of my own\r\npersonal experience. I have often wondered how my mother, when she was a\r\nyoung widow, would have been able to go away to school and get an education\r\nand come back and support me, if my grandparents hadn't been able to take\r\ncare of me. She and I were really very lucky.\r\n\r\nHow many other families have never had that same opportunity? The truth is,\r\nwe don't know the answer to that question, but we do know what the answer\r\nshould be. Not a single American family should ever have to choose between\r\nthe job they need and the child they love.\r\n\r\nA society rooted in responsibility must provide safe streets, safe schools,\r\nand safe neighborhoods. We pursued a strategy of more police, tougher\r\npunishment, smarter prevention with crime-fighting partnerships, with local\r\nlaw enforcement and citizen groups, where the rubber hits the road.\r\n\r\nI can report to you tonight that it's working. Violent crime is down,\r\nrobbery is down, assault is down, burglary is down for five years in a row\r\nall across America. Now, we need to finish the job of putting 100,000 more\r\npolice on our streets.\r\n\r\nAgain, I ask Congress to pass a juvenile crime bill that provides more\r\nprosecutors and probation officers to crack down on gangs and guns and\r\ndrugs and bar violent juveniles from buying guns for life. And I ask you to\r\ndramatically expand our support for after-school programs. I think every\r\nAmerican should know that most juvenile crime is committed between the\r\nhours of 3:00 in the afternoon and 8:00 at night. We can keep so many of\r\nour children out of trouble in the first place if we give them some place\r\nto go other than the streets, and we ought to do it.\r\n\r\nDrug use is on the decline. I thank General McCaffrey for his leadership,\r\nand I thank this Congress for passing the largest anti-drug budget in\r\nhistory. Now I ask you to join me in a ground-breaking effort to hire a\r\nthousand new Border Patrol agents and to deploy the most sophisticated\r\navailable new technologies to help close the door on drugs at our borders.\r\n\r\nPolice, prosecutors, and prevention programs, good as they are, they can't\r\nwork if our court system doesn't work. Today, there are large numbers of\r\nvacancies in our federal courts. Here is what the chief justice of the\r\nUnited States wrote: \"Judicial vacancies cannot remain at such high levels\r\nindefinitely without eroding the quality of justice.\"\r\n\r\nI simply ask the United States Senate to heed this plea and vote on the\r\nhighly qualified nominees before you, up or down.\r\n\r\nWe must exercise responsibility not just at home but around the world. On\r\nthe eve of a new century, we have the power and the duty to build a new era\r\nof peace and security. But make no mistake about it; today's possibilities\r\nare not tomorrow's guarantees. America must stand against the poisoned\r\nappeals of extreme nationalism. We must combat an unholy access of new\r\nthreats from terrorists, international criminals and drug traffickers.\r\n\r\nThese 21st century predators feed on technology and the free flow of\r\ninformation and ideas and people, and they will be all the more lethal if\r\nweapons of mass destruction fall into their hands. To meet these\r\nchallenges, we are helping to write international rules of the road for the\r\n21st century, protecting those who join the family of nations and isolating\r\nthose who do not.\r\n\r\nWithin days, I will ask the Senate for its advice and consent to make\r\nHungary, Poland and the Czech Republic the newest members of NATO. For 50\r\nyears, NATO contained communism and kept America and Europe secure. Now\r\nthese three formerly communist countries have said yes to democracy. I ask\r\nthe Senate to say yes to them, our new allies.\r\n\r\nBy taking in new members and working closely with new partners, including\r\nRussia and Ukraine, NATO can help to assure that Europe is a stronghold for\r\npeace in the 21st century.\r\n\r\nNext, I will ask Congress to continue its support for our troops and their\r\nmission in Bosnia. This Christmas, Hillary and I traveled to Sarajevo with\r\nSenator and Mrs. Dole and a bipartisan congressional delegation. We saw\r\nchildren playing in the streets where, two years ago, they were hiding from\r\nsnipers and shells. The shops were filled with food. The cafes were alive\r\nwith conversation. The progress there is unmistakable; but it is not yet\r\nirreversible.\r\n\r\nTo take firm root, Bosnia's fragile peace still needs the support of\r\nAmerican and allied troops when the current NATO mission ends in June. I\r\nthink Senator Dole actually said it best. He said: \"This is like being\r\nahead in the fourth quarter of a football game; now is not the time to walk\r\noff the field and forfeit the victory.\"\r\n\r\nI wish all of you could have seen our troops in Tuzla. They're very proud\r\nof what they are doing in Bosnia, and we're all very proud of them. One of\r\nthose--one of those brave soldiers is sitting with the first lady tonight:\r\nArmy Sergeant Michael Tolbert. His father was a decorated Vietnam vet.\r\nAfter college in Colorado, he joined the Army. Last year he led an infantry\r\nunit that stopped a mob of extremists from taking over a radio station that\r\nis a voice of democracy and tolerance in Bosnia. Thank you very much,\r\nSergeant, for what you represent.\r\n\r\nIn Bosnia and around the world, our men and women in uniform always do\r\ntheir mission well. Our mission must be to keep them well-trained and\r\nready, to improve their quality of life, and to provide the 21st century\r\nweapons they need to defeat any enemy.\r\n\r\nI ask Congress to join me in pursuing an ambitious agenda to reduce the\r\nserious threat of weapons of mass destruction. This year, four decades\r\nafter it was first proposed by President Eisenhower, a Comprehensive\r\nNuclear Test Ban is within reach. By ending nuclear testing, we can help to\r\nprevent the development of new and more dangerous weapons, and make it more\r\ndifficult for non-nuclear states to build them.\r\n\r\nI am pleased to announce that four former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of\r\nStaff--Generals John Shalikashvili, Colin Powell and David Jones, and\r\nAdmiral William Crowe--have endorsed this treaty, and I ask the Senate to\r\napprove it this year.\r\n\r\nTogether we must also confront the new hazards of chemical and biological\r\nweapons, and the outlaw states, terrorists and organized criminals seeking\r\nto acquire them.\r\n\r\nSaddam Hussein has spent the better part of this decade, and much of his\r\nnation's wealth, not on providing for the Iraqi people, but on developing\r\nnuclear, chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them.\r\n\r\nThe United Nations weapons inspectors have done a truly remarkable job,\r\nfinding and destroying more of Iraq's arsenal than was destroyed during the\r\nentire gulf war. Now, Saddam Hussein wants to stop them from completing\r\ntheir mission.\r\n\r\nI know I speak for everyone in this chamber, Republicans and Democrats,\r\nwhen I say to Saddam Hussein, \"You cannot defy the will of the world,\" and\r\nwhen I say to him, \"You have used weapons of mass destruction before; we\r\nare determined to deny you the capacity to use them again.\"\r\n\r\nLast year, the Senate ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention to protect\r\nour soldiers and citizens from poison gas. Now we must act to prevent the\r\nuse of disease as a weapon of war and terror. The Biological Weapons\r\nConvention has been in effect for 23 years now. The rules are good, but the\r\nenforcement is weak. We must strengthen it with a new international\r\ninspection system to detect and deter cheating. In the months ahead, I will\r\npursue our security strategy with old allies in Asia and Europe, and new\r\npartners from Africa to India and Pakistan, from South America to China.\r\nAnd from Belfast to Korea to the Middle East, America will continue to\r\nstand with those who stand for peace.\r\n\r\nFinally, it's long past time to make good on our debt to the United\r\nNations.\r\n\r\nMore and more we are working with other nations to achieve common goals. If\r\nwe want America to lead, we've got to set a good example. As we see--as we\r\nsee so clearly in Bosnia, allies who share our goals can also share our\r\nburdens. In this new era, our freedom and independence are actually\r\nenriched, not weakened, by our increasing interdependence with other\r\nnations. But we have to do our part.\r\n\r\nOur founders set America on a permanent course toward a more perfect union.\r\nTo all of you, I say, it is a journey we can only make together, living as\r\none community.\r\n\r\nFirst, we have to continue to reform our government, the instrument of our\r\nnational community. Everyone knows elections have become too expensive,\r\nfueling a fund-raising arms race.\r\n\r\nThis year, by March the 6th, at long last the Senate will actually vote on\r\nbipartisan campaign finance reform proposed by senators McCain and\r\nFeingold. Let's be clear; a vote against McCain-Feingold is a vote for soft\r\nmoney and for the status quo. I ask you to strengthen our democracy and\r\npass campaign finance reform this year.\r\n\r\nBut at least equally important, we have to address the real reason for the\r\nexplosion in campaign costs: the high cost of media advertising. I will--\r\nfor the folks watching at home, those were the groans of pain in the\r\naudience--I will formally request that the Federal Communications\r\nCommission act to provide free or reduced-cost television time--for\r\ncandidates who observe spending limits voluntarily. The airwaves are a\r\npublic trust, and broadcasters also have to help us in this effort to\r\nstrengthen our democracy.\r\n\r\nUnder the leadership of Vice President Gore, we have reduced the federal\r\npayroll by 300,000 workers, cut 16,000 pages of regulation, eliminated\r\nhundreds of programs and improved the operations of virtually every\r\ngovernment agency. But we can do more.\r\n\r\nLike every taxpayer, I'm outraged by the reports of abuses by the IRS. We\r\nneed some changes there: new citizen advocacy panels, a stronger taxpayer\r\nadvocate, phone lines open 24 hours a day, relief for innocent taxpayers.\r\n\r\nLast year, by an overwhelming bipartisan margin, the House of\r\nRepresentatives passed sweeping IRS reforms. This bill must not now\r\nlanguish in the Senate. Tonight, I ask the Senate: Follow the House; pass\r\nthe bipartisan package as your first order of business. I hope to goodness\r\nbefore I finish I can think of something to say 'Follow the Senate' on so\r\nI'll be out of trouble!\r\n\r\nA nation that lives as a community must value all its communities. For the\r\npast five years, we have worked to bring the spark of private enterprise to\r\ninner city and poor rural areas with community development banks, more\r\ncommercial loans into poor neighborhoods, cleanup of polluted sites for\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nUnder the continued leadership of the vice president, we propose to triple\r\nthe number of empowerment zones to give business incentives to invest in\r\nthose areas. We should. We should also give poor families more help to move\r\ninto homes of their own, and we should use tax cuts to spur the\r\nconstruction of more low-income housing.\r\n\r\nLast year, this Congress took strong action to help the District of\r\nColumbia. Let us renew our resolve to make our capital city a great city\r\nfor all who live and visit here.\r\n\r\nOur cities are the vibrant hubs of great metropolitan areas. They are still\r\nthe gateway for new immigrants from every continent who come here to work\r\nfor their own American dreams. Let's keep our cities going strong into the\r\n21st Century. They're a very important part of our future.\r\n\r\nOur communities are only as healthy as the air our children breathe, the\r\nwater they drink, the Earth they will inherit. Last year we put in place\r\nthe toughest-ever controls on smog and soot. We moved to protect\r\nYellowstone, the Everglades, Lake Tahoe. We expanded every community's\r\nright to know about toxics that threaten their children.\r\n\r\nJust yesterday, our food safety plan took effect, using new science to\r\nprotect consumers from dangers like e. coli and salmonella.\r\n\r\nTonight, I ask you to join me in launching a new Clean Water initiative, a\r\nfar-reaching effort to clean our rivers, our lakes and our coastal waters\r\nfor our children.\r\n\r\nOur overriding environmental challenge tonight is the worldwide problem of\r\nclimate change, global warming, the gathering crisis that requires\r\nworldwide action. The vast majority of scientists have concluded\r\nunequivocally that if we don't reduce the emission of greenhouse gases at\r\nsome point in the next century, we'll disrupt our climate and put our\r\nchildren and grandchildren at risk.\r\n\r\nThis past December, America led the world to reach a historic agreement\r\ncommitting our nation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through market\r\nforces, new technologies, energy efficiency.\r\n\r\nWe have it in our power to act right here, right now. I propose $6 billion\r\nin tax cuts, in research and development, to encourage innovation,\r\nrenewable energy, fuel-efficient cars, energy-efficient homes. Every time\r\nwe have acted to heal our environment, pessimists have told us it would\r\nhurt the economy. Well, today our economy is the strongest in a generation,\r\nand our environment is the cleanest in a generation. We have always found a\r\nway to clean the environment and grow the economy at the same time. And\r\nwhen it comes to global warming, we'll do it again.\r\n\r\nFinally, community means living by the defining American value, the ideal\r\nheard 'round the world: that we're all created equal. Throughout our\r\nhistory, we haven't always honored that ideal, and we've never fully lived\r\nup to it. Often it's easier to believe that our differences matter more\r\nthan what we have in common. It may be easier, but it's wrong.\r\n\r\nWhat we have to do in our day and generation to make sure that America\r\ntruly becomes one nation, what do we have to do? We're becoming more and\r\nmore and more diverse. Do you believe we can become one nation? The answer\r\ncannot be to dwell on our differences, but to build on our shared values.\r\n\r\nAnd we all cherish family and faith, freedom and responsibility. We all\r\nwant our children to grow up in the world where their talents are matched\r\nby their opportunities.\r\n\r\nI've launched this national initiative on race to help us recognize our\r\ncommon interests and to bridge the opportunity gaps that are keeping us\r\nfrom becoming one America. Let us begin by recognizing what we still must\r\novercome.\r\n\r\nDiscrimination against any American is un-American. We must vigorously\r\nenforce the laws that make it illegal. I ask your help to end the backlog\r\nat the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Sixty thousand of our\r\nfellow citizens are waiting in line for justice, and we should act now to\r\nend their wait.\r\n\r\nWe should also recognize that the greatest progress we can make toward\r\nbuilding one America lies in the progress we make for all Americans,\r\nwithout regard to race. When we open the doors of college to all Americans,\r\nwhen we rid all our streets of crime, when there are jobs available to\r\npeople from all our neighborhoods, when we make sure all parents have the\r\nchild care they need, we're helping to build one nation.\r\n\r\nWe in this chamber and in this government must do all we can to address the\r\ncontinuing American challenge to build one America. But we'll only move\r\nforward if all our fellow citizens, including every one of you at home\r\nwatching tonight, is also committed to this cause.\r\n\r\nWe must work together, learn together, live together, serve together. On\r\nthe forge of common enterprise, Americans of all backgrounds can hammer out\r\na common identity.\r\n\r\nWe see it today in the United States military, in the Peace Corps, in\r\nAmeriCorps. Wherever people of all races and backgrounds come together in a\r\nshared endeavor and get a fair chance, we do just fine. With shared values\r\nand meaningful opportunities and honest communications and citizen service,\r\nwe can unite a diverse people in freedom and mutual respect. We are many.\r\nWe must be one.\r\n\r\nIn that spirit, let us lift our eyes to the new millennium. How will we\r\nmark that passage? It just happens once every thousand years. This year,\r\nHillary and I launched the White House Millennium Program to promote\r\nAmerica's creativity and innovation and to preserve our heritage and\r\nculture into the 21st century. Our culture lives in every community, and\r\nevery community has places of historic value that tell our stories as\r\nAmericans. We should protect them.\r\n\r\nI am proposing a public-private partnership to advance our arts and\r\nhumanities and to celebrate the millennium by saving America's treasures\r\ngreat and small. And while we honor the past, let us imagine the future.\r\n\r\nNow, think about this. The entire store of human knowledge now doubles\r\nevery five years. In the 1980s, scientists identified the gene causing\r\ncystic fibrosis; it took nine years. Last year, scientists located the gene\r\nthat causes Parkinson's disease--in only nine days! Within a decade, gene\r\nchips will offer a road map for prevention of illnesses throughout a\r\nlifetime. Soon, we'll be able to carry all the phone calls on Mother's Day\r\non a single strand of fiber the width of a human hair. A child born in 1998\r\nmay well live to see the 22nd century.\r\n\r\nTonight, as part of our gift to the millennium, I propose a 21st Century\r\nresearch fund for pathbreaking scientific inquiry, the largest funding\r\nincrease in history for the National Institutes of Health, the National\r\nScience Foundation, and the National Cancer Institute. We have already\r\ndiscovered we have already discovered genes for breast cancer and diabetes.\r\nI ask you to support this initiative so ours will be the generation that\r\nfinally wins the war against cancer and begins a revolution in our fight\r\nagainst all deadly diseases.\r\n\r\nAs important as all this scientific progress is, we must continue to see\r\nthat science serves humanity, not the other way around. We must prevent the\r\nmisuse of genetic tests to discriminate against any American, and we must\r\nratify the ethical consensus of the scientific and religious communities,\r\nand ban the cloning of human beings.\r\n\r\nWe should enable all the world's people to explore the far reaches of\r\ncyberspace. Think of this: the first time I made a State of the Union\r\nspeech to you, only a handful of physicists used the World Wide Web--\r\nliterally just a handful of people.\r\n\r\nNow in schools and libraries, homes and businesses, millions and millions\r\nof Americans surf the Net every day.\r\n\r\nWe must give parents the tools they need to help protect their children\r\nfrom inappropriate material on the Net, but we also must make sure that we\r\nprotect the exploding, global commercial potential of the Internet. We can\r\ndo the kinds of things that we need to do and still protect our kids. For\r\none thing, I ask Congress to step up support for building the next\r\ngeneration Internet. It's getting kind of clogged, you know. And the next\r\ngeneration Internet will operate at speeds up to a thousand times faster\r\nthan today.\r\n\r\nEven as we explore this inner space, in the new millennium we're going to\r\nopen new frontiers in outer space.\r\n\r\nThroughout all history, human kind has had only one place to call home: our\r\nplanet Earth. Beginning this year, 1998, men and women from 16 countries\r\nwill build a foothold in the heavens--the International Space Station. With\r\nits vast expanses, scientists and engineers will actually set sail on an\r\nuncharted sea of limitless mystery and unlimited potential.\r\n\r\nAnd this October, a true American hero, a veteran pilot of 149 combat\r\nmissions and one five-hour space flight that changed the world, will return\r\nto the heavens. Godspeed, John Glenn!\r\n\r\nJohn, you will carry with you America's hopes, and on your uniform once\r\nagain you will carry America's flag, marking the unbroken connection\r\nbetween the deeds of America's past and the daring of America's future.\r\n\r\nNearly 200 years ago, a tattered flag, its broad stripes and bright stars\r\nstill gleaming through the smoke of a fierce battle, moved Francis Scott\r\nKey to scribble a few words on the back of an envelope, the words that\r\nbecame our National Anthem. Today, that Star-Spangled Banner, along with\r\nthe Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights,\r\nare on display just a short walk from here. They are America's treasures.\r\nAnd we must also save them for the ages.\r\n\r\nI ask all Americans to support our project to restore all our treasures so\r\nthat the generations of the 21st century can see for themselves the images\r\nand the words that are the old and continuing glory of America, an America\r\nthat has continued to rise through every age against every challenge, a\r\npeople of great works and greater possibilities, who have always, always\r\nfound the wisdom and strength to come together as one nation, to widen the\r\ncircle of opportunity, to deepen the meaning of our freedom, to form that\r\nmore perfect union.\r\n\r\nLet that be our gift to the 21st century.\r\n\r\nGod bless you, and God bless the United States.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nWilliam J. Clinton\r\nJanuary 19, 1999\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, honored guests, my\r\nfellow Americans:\r\n\r\nTonight I have the honor of reporting to you on the State of the Union.\r\n\r\nLet me begin by saluting the new speaker of the House and thanking him\r\nespecially tonight for extending an invitation to two guests sitting in the\r\ngallery with Mrs. Hastert. Lyn Gibson and Wei Ling Chestnut are the widows\r\nof the two brave Capitol Hill police officers who gave their lives to\r\ndefend freedom's house.\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker, at your swearing in you asked us all to work together in a\r\nspirit of civility and bipartisanship. Mr. Speaker, let's do exactly that.\r\n\r\nTonight, I stand before you to report that America has created the longest\r\npeacetime economic expansion in our history. With nearly 18 million new\r\njobs, wages rising at more than twice the rate of inflation, the highest\r\nhomeownership in history, the smallest welfare roles in 30 years, and the\r\nlowest peacetime unemployment since 1957.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in three decades, the budget is balanced. From a deficit\r\nof $290 billion in 1992, we had a surplus of $70 billion last year. And\r\nnow, we are on course for budget surpluses for the next 25 years.\r\n\r\nThanks to the pioneering leadership of all of you, we have the lowest\r\nviolent crime rate in a quarter century and the cleanest environment in a\r\nquarter century.\r\n\r\nAmerica is a strong force for peace--from Northern Ireland to Bosnia to\r\nthe Middle East.\r\n\r\nThanks to the leadership of Vice President Gore, we have a government for\r\nthe Information Age, once again a government that is a progressive\r\ninstrument of the common good, rooted in our oldest values of opportunity,\r\nresponsibility and community, devoted to fiscal responsibility, determined\r\nto give our people the tools they need to make the most of their own lives\r\nin the 21st century, a 21st century government for 21st century America.\r\n\r\nMy fellow Americans, I stand before you tonight to report that the state of\r\nour union is strong. Now, America is working again. The promise of our\r\nfuture is limitless. But we cannot realize that promise if we allow the hum\r\nof our prosperity to lull us into complacency. How we fare as a nation far\r\ninto the 21st century depends upon what we do as a nation today.\r\n\r\nSo, with our budget surplus growing, our economy expanding, our confidence\r\nrising, now is the moment for this generation to meet our historic\r\nresponsibility to the 21st century.\r\n\r\nOur fiscal discipline gives us an unsurpassed opportunity to address a\r\nremarkable new challenge, the aging of America. With the number of elderly\r\nAmericans set to double by 2030, the baby boom will become a senior boom.\r\n\r\nSo first and above all, we must save Social Security for the 21st century.\r\n\r\nEarly in this century, being old meant being poor. When President Roosevelt\r\ncreated Social Security, thousands wrote to thank him for eliminating what\r\none woman called \"the stark terror of penniless, helpless old age.\" Even\r\ntoday, without Social Security, half our nation's elderly would be forced\r\ninto poverty.\r\n\r\nToday, Social Security is strong, but by 2013, payroll taxes will no longer\r\nbe sufficient to cover monthly payments. By 2032, the trust fund will be\r\nexhausted and Social Security will be unable to pay the full benefits older\r\nAmericans have been promised.\r\n\r\nThe best way to keep Social Security a rock solid guarantee is not to make\r\ndrastic cuts in benefits; not to raise payroll tax rates; not to drain\r\nresources from Social Security in the name of saving it. Instead, I propose\r\nthat we make the historic decision to invest the surplus to save Social\r\nSecurity.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I propose that we commit 60 percent of the budget surplus for\r\nthe next 15 years to Social Security, investing a small portion in the\r\nprivate sector just as any private or state government pension would do.\r\nThis will earn a higher return and keep Social Security sound for 55\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nBut we must aim higher. We should put Social Security on a sound footing\r\nfor the next 75 years. We should reduce poverty among elderly women, who\r\nare nearly twice as likely to be poor as are other seniors. And we should\r\neliminate the limits on what seniors on Social Security can earn.\r\n\r\nNow, these changes will require difficult, but fully achievable choices\r\nover and above the dedication of the surplus. They must be made on a\r\nbipartisan basis. They should be made this year. So let me say to you\r\ntonight, I reach out my hand to all of you in both houses in both parties\r\nand ask that we join together in saying to the American people, we will\r\nsave Social Security now.\r\n\r\nNow, last year, we wisely reserved all of the surplus until we knew what it\r\nwould take to save Social Security. Again, I say, we shouldn't spend any of\r\nit, not any of it, until after Social Security is truly saved. First\r\nthing's first.\r\n\r\nSecond, once we have saved Social Security, we must fulfill our obligation\r\nto save and improve Medicare. Already we have extended the life of the\r\nMedicare trust fund by 10 years, but we should extend it for at least\r\nanother decade. Tonight, I propose that we use one out of every six dollars\r\nin the surplus for the next 15 years to guarantee the soundness of Medicare\r\nuntil the year 2020.\r\n\r\nBut, again--but, again, we should aim higher. We must be willing to work\r\nin a bipartisan way and look at new ideas, including the upcoming report of\r\nthe Bipartisan Medicare Commission. If we work together, we can secure\r\nMedicare for the next two decades and cover the greatest growing need of\r\nseniors--affordable prescription drugs.\r\n\r\nThird, we must help all Americans from their first day on the job to save,\r\nto invest, to create wealth.\r\n\r\nFrom its beginnings, Americans have supplemented Social Security with\r\nprivate pensions and savings. Yet today millions of people retire with\r\nlittle to live on other than Social Security. Americans living longer than\r\never simply must save more than ever.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in addition to saving Social Security and Medicare, I propose a\r\nnew pension initiative for retirement security in the 21st century. I\r\npropose that we use a little over 11 percent of the surplus to establish\r\nuniversal savings accounts--USA accounts--to give all Americans the means\r\nto save.\r\n\r\nWith these new accounts, Americans can invest as they choose and receive\r\nfunds to match a portion of their savings with extra help for those least\r\nable to save. USA accounts will help all Americans to share in our nation's\r\nwealth and to enjoy a more secure retirement. I ask you to support them.\r\n\r\nFourth, we must invest in long-term care.\r\n\r\nI propose a tax credit of $1,000 for the aged, ailing or disabled and the\r\nfamilies who care for them. Long-term care will become a bigger and bigger\r\nchallenge with the aging of America--and we must do more to help our\r\nfamilies deal with it.\r\n\r\nI was born in 1946, the first year of the baby boom. I can tell you that\r\none of the greatest concerns of our generation is our absolute\r\ndetermination not to let our growing old place an intolerable burden on our\r\nchildren and their ability to raise our grandchildren.\r\n\r\nOur economic success and our fiscal discipline now give us the opportunity\r\nto lift that burden from their shoulders, and we should take it.\r\n\r\nSaving Social Security, Medicare, creating U.S. accounts, this is the right\r\nway to use the surplus. If we do so, if we do so, we will still have\r\nresources to meet critical needs and education and defense.\r\n\r\nAnd I want to point out that this proposal is fiscally sound. Listen to\r\nthis, if we set aside 60 percent of the surplus for Social Security and 16\r\npercent for Medicare over the next 15 years, that savings will achieve the\r\nlowest level of publicly-held debt since right before World War I in 1917.\r\n\r\nSo with these four measures; saving Social Security, strengthening\r\nMedicare, establishing the USA accounts, supporting long-term care, we can\r\nbegin to meet our generation's historic responsibility to establish true\r\nsecurity for 21st century seniors.\r\n\r\nNow, there are more children, from more diverse backgrounds, in our public\r\nschools that any time in our history. Their education must provide the\r\nknowledge and nurture the creativity that will allow our entire nation to\r\nthrive in the new economy.\r\n\r\nToday we can say something we couldn't say six years ago. With tax credits\r\nand more affordable student loans, with more work-study grants and more\r\nPell Grants, with education IRAs, the new HOPE Scholarship tax cut that\r\nmore than five million Americans will receive this year, we have finally\r\nopened the doors of college to all Americans.\r\n\r\nWith our support, nearly every state has set higher academic standards for\r\npublic schools and a voluntary national test is being developed to measure\r\nthe progress of our students. With over $1 billion in discounts available\r\nthis year, we are well on our way to our goal of connecting every classroom\r\nand library to the Internet.\r\n\r\nLast fall, you passed our proposal to start hiring 100,000 new teachers to\r\nreduce class size in the early grades. Now I ask you to finish the job.\r\n\r\nYou know our children are doing better. SAT scores are up. Math scores have\r\nrisen in nearly all grades. But there's a problem. While our fourth-graders\r\nout performed their peers in other countries in math and science, our\r\neighth-graders are around average, and our 12th-graders rank near the\r\nbottom. We must do better.\r\n\r\nNow each year the national government invests more than $15 billion in our\r\npublic schools. I believe we must change the way we invest that money to\r\nsupport what works and to stop supporting what does not work.\r\n\r\nFirst, later this year I will send to Congress a plan that for the first\r\ntime holds states and school districts accountable for progress and rewards\r\nthem for results. My Education Accountability Act will require every school\r\ndistrict receiving federal help to take the following five steps:\r\n\r\nFirst, all schools must end social promotion.\r\n\r\nNow, no child, no child should graduate from high school with a diploma he\r\nor she can't read. We do our children no favors when we allow them to pass\r\nfrom grade to grade without mastering the material. But we can't just hold\r\nstudents back because the system fails them.\r\n\r\nSo my balanced budget triples the funding for summer school and\r\nafter-school programs to keep a million children learning. Now, if--if you\r\ndoubt this will work, just look at Chicago, which ended social promotion\r\nand made summer school mandatory for those who don't master the basics.\r\nMath and reading scores are up three years running with some of the biggest\r\ngains in some of the poorest neighborhoods. It will work, and we should do\r\nit.\r\n\r\nSecond, all states and school districts must turn around their worst\r\nperforming schools or shut them down. That's the policy established in\r\nNorth Carolina by Governor Jim Hunt. North Carolina made the biggest gains\r\nin test scores in the nation last year. Our budget includes $200 million to\r\nhelp states turn around their own failing schools.\r\n\r\nThird, all states and school districts must be held responsible for the\r\nquality of their teachers. The great majority of our teachers do a fine\r\njob, but in too many schools teachers don't have college majors or even\r\nminors in the subjects they teach. New teachers should be required to pass\r\nperformance exams, and all teachers should know the subject their\r\nteaching.\r\n\r\nThis year's balanced budget contains resources to help them reach higher\r\nstandards. And to attract talented young teachers to the toughest\r\nassignments, I recommend a six-fold increase in our program for college\r\nscholarships for students who commit to teach in the inner-cities and\r\nisolated rural areas and in Indian communities. Let us bring excellence to\r\nevery part of America.\r\n\r\nFourth, we must empower parents with more information and more choices. In\r\ntoo many communities it's easier to get information on the quality of the\r\nlocal restaurants than on the quality of the local schools.\r\n\r\nEvery school district should issue report cards on every school. And\r\nparents should be given more choices in selecting their public schools.\r\n\r\nWhen I became president, there was just one independent public charter\r\nschool in all America. With our support on a bipartisan basis, today there\r\nare 1,100. My budget assures that early in the next century, there will be\r\n3,000.\r\n\r\nFifth, to assure that our classrooms are truly places of learning, and to\r\nrespond to what teachers have been asking us to do for years, we should say\r\nthat all states and school districts must both adopt and implement sensible\r\ndiscipline policies.\r\n\r\nNow let's do one more thing for our children. Today, too many schools are\r\nso old they're falling apart, or so overcrowded students are learning in\r\ntrailers. Last fall, Congress missed the opportunity to change that. This\r\nyear, with 53 million children in our schools, Congress must not miss that\r\nopportunity again. I ask you to help our communities build or modernize\r\n5,000 schools.\r\n\r\nIf we do these things--end social promotion, turn around failing schools,\r\nbuild modern ones, support qualified teachers, promote innovation,\r\ncompetition and discipline--then we will begin to meet our generation's\r\nhistoric responsibility to create to 21st century schools.\r\n\r\nNow, we also have to do more to support the millions of parents who give\r\ntheir all every day at home and at work.\r\n\r\nThe most basic tool of all is a decent income. So let's raise the minimum\r\nwage by a dollar an hour over the next two years.\r\n\r\nAnd let's make sure that women and men get equal pay for equal work by\r\nstrengthening enforcement of the equal pay laws.\r\n\r\nThat was encouraging, you know? There was more balance on the seesaw. I\r\nlike that. Let's give them a hand. That's great.\r\n\r\nWorking parents also need quality child care. So, again this year, I ask\r\nCongress to support our plan for tax credits and subsidies for working\r\nfamilies, for improved safety and quality, for expanded after-school\r\nprogram. And our plan also includes a new tax credit for stay-at-home\r\nparents, too. They need support as well.\r\n\r\nParents should never have to worry about choosing between their children\r\nand their work. Now, the Family and Medical Leave Act, the very first bill\r\nI signed into law, has now, since 1993, helped millions and millions of\r\nAmericans to care for a newborn baby or an ailing relative without risking\r\ntheir jobs. I think it's time, with all of the evidence that it has been so\r\nlittle burdensome to employers, to extend family leave to 10 million more\r\nAmericans working for smaller companies, and I hope you will support it.\r\n\r\nFinally, on the matter of work, parents should never have to face\r\ndiscrimination in the workplace. So I want to ask Congress to prohibit\r\ncompanies from refusing to hire or promote workers simply because they have\r\nchildren. That is not right.\r\n\r\nAmerica's families deserve the world's best medical care. Thanks to\r\nbipartisan federal support for medical research, we are not on the verge of\r\nnew treatments to prevent or delay diseases from Parkinson's to Alzheimer's\r\nto arthritis to cancer. But as we continue our advances in medical science,\r\nwe can't let our medical system lag behind.\r\n\r\nManaged care has literally transformed medicine in America, driving down\r\ncosts, but threatening to drive down quality as well.\r\n\r\nI think we ought to say to every American, you should have the right to\r\nknow all you medical options, not just the cheapest. If you need a\r\nspecialist, you should have a right to see one. You have a right to the\r\nnearest emergency care if you're in an accident. These are things that we\r\nought to say. And I think we ought to say you should have a right to keep\r\nyour doctor during a period of treatment whether it's a pregnancy or a\r\nchemotherapy treatment or anything else. I believe this.\r\n\r\nNow I've ordered these rights to be extended to the 85 million Americans\r\nserved by Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health programs. But only\r\nCongress can pass a Patients' Bill of Rights for all Americans.\r\n\r\nLast year, Congress missed that opportunity, and we must not miss that\r\nopportunity again. For the sake of our families, I ask us to join together\r\nacross party lines and pass a strong enforceable Patients' Bill of Rights.\r\n\r\nAs more of our medical records are stored electronically, the threats to\r\nall of our privacy increase. Because Congress has given me the authority to\r\nact if it does not do so by August, one way or another, we can all say to\r\nthe American people, we will protect the privacy of medical records this\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nNow, two years ago, we acted to extend health coverage to up to five\r\nmillion children. Now we should go beyond that. We should make it easier\r\nfor small businesses to offer health insurance. We should give people\r\nbetween the ages of 55 and 65 who lose their health insurance the chance to\r\nbuy into Medicare.\r\n\r\nAnd we should continue to ensure access to family planning. No one should\r\nhave to choose between keeping health care and taking a job. And therefore,\r\nI especially ask you tonight to join hands to pass the landmark bipartisan\r\nlegislation proposed by Sens. Kennedy and Jeffords, Roth and Moynihan, to\r\nallow people with disabilities to keep their health insurance when they go\r\nto work.\r\n\r\nWe need to enable our public hospitals, our community, our university\r\nhealth centers to provide basic, affordable care for all the millions of\r\nworking families who don't have any insurance. They do a lot of that today,\r\nbut much more can be done. And my balanced budget makes a good down payment\r\ntoward that goal. I hope you will think about them and support that\r\nprovision.\r\n\r\nLet me say we must step up our efforts to treat and prevent mental illness.\r\nNo American should ever be able--afraid ever to address this disease. This\r\nyear we will host a White House Conference on Mental Health. With\r\nsensitivity, commitment and passion, Tipper Gore is leading our efforts\r\nhere, and I'd like to thank her for what she's done. Thank you. Thank you.\r\n\r\nAs everyone knows, our children are targets of a massive media campaign to\r\nhook them on cigarettes. Now, I ask this Congress to resist the tobacco\r\nlobby, to reaffirm the FDA's authority to protect our children from tobacco\r\nand to hold tobacco companies accountable, while protecting tobacco\r\nfarmers.\r\n\r\nSmoking has cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars under Medicare\r\nand other programs. You know, the states have been right about this.\r\nTaxpayers shouldn't pay for the cost of lung cancer, emphysema, and other\r\nsmoking-related illnesses, the tobacco companies should.\r\n\r\nSo tonight I announce that the Justice Department is preparing a litigation\r\nplan to take the tobacco companies to court and with the funds we recover\r\nto strengthen Medicare.\r\n\r\nNow, if we act in these areas--minimum wage, family leave, child care,\r\nhealth care, the safety of our children--then we will begin to meet our\r\ngeneration's historic responsibilities to strengthen our families for the\r\n21st century.\r\n\r\nToday, America is the most dynamic, competitive, job-creating economy in\r\nhistory, but we can do even better in building a 21st century economy that\r\nembraces all Americans.\r\n\r\nToday's income gap is largely a skills gap. Last year, the Congress passed\r\na law enabling workers to get a skills grant to choose the training they\r\nneed. And I applaud all of you here who were part of that.\r\n\r\nThis year, I recommend a five-year commitment to the new system, so that we\r\ncan provide over the next five years appropriate training opportunities for\r\nall Americans who lose their jobs and expand rapid response teams to help\r\nall towns which have been really hurt when businesses close. I hope you\r\nwill support this.\r\n\r\nAlso, I ask your support for a dramatic increase in federal support for\r\nadult literacy to mount a national campaign aimed at helping the millions\r\nand millions of working people who still read at less than a fifth-grade\r\nlevel. We need to do this.\r\n\r\nHere's some good news. In the past six years, we have cut the welfare rolls\r\nnearly in half.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago, from this podium, I asked five companies to lead a national\r\neffort to hire people off welfare. Tonight our welfare-to-work partnership\r\nincludes 10,000 companies who have hired hundreds of thousands of people,\r\nand our balanced budget will help another 200,000 people move to the\r\ndignity and pride of work. I hope you will support it.\r\n\r\nWe must bring the spark of private enterprise to every corner of America,\r\nto build a bridge from Wall Street to Appalachia to the Mississippi Delta,\r\nto our Native American communities, with more support for community\r\ndevelopment banks for empowerment zones, for 100,000 more vouchers for\r\naffordable housing.\r\n\r\nAnd I ask Congress to support our bold new plan to help businesses raise up\r\nto $15 billion in private sector capital, to bring jobs and opportunities\r\nand inner cities, rural areas, with tax credits, loan guarantees, including\r\nthe new American Private Investment Companies, modeled on the Overseas\r\nPrivate Investment Companies.\r\n\r\nNow, for years and years we've had this OPIC, this Overseas Private\r\nInvestment Corporation, because we knew we had untapped markets overseas.\r\nBut our greatest untapped markets are not overseas--they are right here at\r\nhome. And we should go after them.\r\n\r\nWe must work hard to help bring prosperity back to the family farm.\r\n\r\nAs this Congress knows very well, dropping prices and the loss of foreign\r\nmarkets have devastated too many family farmers. Last year, the Congress\r\nprovided substantial assistance to help stave off a disaster in American\r\nagriculture, and I am ready to work with lawmakers of both parties to\r\ncreate a farm safety net that will include crop insurance reform and farm\r\nincome assistance.\r\n\r\nI ask you to join with me and do this. This should not be a political\r\nissue. Everyone knows what an economic problem is going on out there in\r\nrural America today, and we need an appropriate means to address it.\r\n\r\nWe must strengthen our lead in technology. It was government investment\r\nthat led to the creation of the Internet. I propose a 28-percent increase\r\nin long-term computing research.\r\n\r\nWe also must be ready for the 21st century from its very first moment by\r\nsolving the so-called Y2K computer problem. We had one member of Congress\r\nstand up and applaud. And we may have about that ration out there\r\napplauding at home in front of their television sets. But remember, this is\r\na big, big problem, and we've been working hard on it. Already we've made\r\nsure that the Social Security checks will come on time.\r\n\r\nBut I want all the folks at home listening to this to know that we need\r\nevery state and local government, every business large and small to work\r\nwith us to make sure that this Y2K computer bug will be remembered as the\r\nlast headache of the 20th century, not the first crisis of the 21st.\r\n\r\nFor our own prosperity, we must support economic growth abroad. You know,\r\nuntil recently a third of our economic growth came from exports. But over\r\nthe past year and a half, financial turmoil has put that growth at risk.\r\nToday, much of the world is in recession, with Asia hit especially hard.\r\nThis is the most serious financial crisis in half a century.\r\n\r\nTo meet it, the U.S. and other nations have reduced interest rates and\r\nstrengthened the International Monetary Fund and while the turmoil is not\r\nover, we have worked very hard with other nations to contain it.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, we will continue to work on the long-term project:\r\nbuilding a global financial system for the 21st century that promotes\r\nprosperity and tames the cycle of boom and bust that has engulfed so much\r\nof Asia. This June, I will meet with other world leaders to advance this\r\nhistoric purpose and I ask all of you to support our endeavors. I also ask\r\nyou to support creating a freer and fairer trading system for 21st century\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nYou know, I'd like to say something really serious to everyone in this\r\nchamber in both parties. I think trade has divided us and divided Americans\r\noutside this chamber for too long. Somehow, we have to find a common ground\r\non which business and workers and environmentalists and farmers and\r\ngovernment can stand together. I believe these are the things we ought to\r\nall agree on. So, let me try.\r\n\r\nFirst, we ought to tear down barriers, open markets and expand trade, but\r\nat the same time, we must ensure that ordinary citizens in all countries\r\nactually benefit from trade; a trade that promotes the dignity of work and\r\nthe rights of workers and protects the environment.\r\n\r\nWe must insist that international trade organizations be open to public\r\nscrutiny instead of mysterious, secret things subject to wild criticism.\r\n\r\nWhen you come right down to it, now that the world economy is becoming more\r\nand more integrated, we have to do in the world what we spent the better\r\npart of this century doing here at home. We have got to put a human face on\r\nthe global economy.\r\n\r\nNow, we must enforce our trade laws when imports unlawfully flood our\r\nnation. I have already informed the government of Japan if that nation's\r\nsudden surge of steel imports into our country is not reversed, America\r\nwill respond.\r\n\r\nWe must help all manufacturers hit hard by the present crisis with loan\r\nguarantees, and other incentives to increase American exports by nearly $2\r\nbillion. I'd like to believe we can achieve a new consensus on trade based\r\non these principles. And I ask the Congress to join me again in this common\r\napproach and to give the president the trade authority long used and now\r\noverdue and necessary to advance our prosperity in the 21st century.\r\n\r\nTonight, I issue a call to the nations of the world to join the United\r\nStates in a new round of global trade negotiation to expand exports of\r\nservices, manufactures and farm products.\r\n\r\nTonight, I say, we will work with the International Labor Organization on a\r\nnew initiative to raise labor standards around the world. And this year, we\r\nwill lead the international community to conclude a treaty to ban abusive\r\nchild labor everywhere in the world.\r\n\r\nIf we do these things--invest in our people, our communities, our\r\ntechnology--and lead in the global economy, then we will begin to meet our\r\nhistoric responsibility to build a 21st century prosperity for America.\r\n\r\nYou know, no nation in history has had the opportunity and the\r\nresponsibility we now have to shape a world that is more peaceful, more\r\nsecure, more free.\r\n\r\nAll Americans can be proud that our leadership helped to bring peace in\r\nNorthern Ireland.\r\n\r\nAll Americans can be proud that our leadership has put Bosnia on the path\r\nto peace. And with our NATO allies we are pressing the Serbian government\r\nto stop its brutal repression in Kosovo--to bring those responsible to\r\njustice and to give the people of Kosovo the self-government they deserve.\r\n\r\nAll Americans can be proud that our leadership renewed hope for lasting\r\npeace in the Middle East. Some of you were with me last December as we\r\nwatched the Palestinian National Council completely renounce its call for\r\nthe destruction of Israel.\r\n\r\nNow, I ask Congress to provide resources so that all parties can implement\r\nthe Wye Agreement, to protect Israel's security, to stimulate the\r\nPalestinian economy, to support our friends in Jordan. We must not, we dare\r\nnot, let them down. I hope you will help me.\r\n\r\nAs we work for peace, we must also meet threats to our nation's security,\r\nincluding increased danger from outlaw nations and terrorism.\r\n\r\nWe will defend our security wherever we are threatened, as we did this\r\nsummer when we struck at Osama bin Laden's network of terror. The bombing\r\nof our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania reminds us again of the risks faced\r\nevery day by those who represent America to the world. So let's give them\r\nthe support they need, the safest possible workplaces, and the resources\r\nthey must have so America can continue to lead.\r\n\r\nWe must work to keep terrorists from disrupting computer networks. We must\r\nwork to prepare local communities for biological and chemical emergencies,\r\nto support research into vaccines and treatments. We must increase our\r\nefforts to restrain the spread of nuclear weapons and missiles, from Korea\r\nto India and Pakistan. We must expand our work with Russia, Ukraine and\r\nother former Soviet nations to safeguard nuclear materials and technology\r\nso they never fall into the wrong hands. Our balanced budget will increase\r\nfunding for these critical efforts by almost two-thirds over the next five\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nWith Russia we must continue to reduce our nuclear arsenals. The START II\r\nTreaty and the framework we have already agreed to for START III could cut\r\nthem by 80 percent from their Cold War height.\r\n\r\nIt's been two years since I signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. If we\r\ndon't do the right thing, other nations won't either. I ask the Senate to\r\ntake this vital step, approve the treaty now to make it harder for other\r\nnations to develop nuclear arms, and to make sure we can end nuclear\r\ntesting for ever.\r\n\r\nFor nearly a decade, Iraq has defied its obligations to destroy its weapons\r\nof terror and the missiles to deliver them.\r\n\r\nAmerica will continue to contain [Iraqi President] Saddam [Hussein] and we\r\nwill work for the day when Iraq has a government worthy of its people. Now,\r\nlast month, in our action over Iraq, our troops were superb. Their mission\r\nwas so flawlessly executed, that we risk taking for granted the bravery and\r\nskill it required. Captain Jeff Taliaferro, a 10-year Air Force veteran of\r\nthe Air Force, flew a B-1B bomber over Iraq as we attacked Saddam's war\r\nmachine. He is here with us tonight. I would like to ask you to honor him\r\nand all the 33,000 men and women of Operation Desert Fox.\r\n\r\nIt is time to reverse the decline in defense spending that began in 1985.\r\n\r\nSince April, together we have added nearly $6 billion to maintain our\r\nmilitary readiness. My balanced budget calls for a sustained increase over\r\nthe next six years for readiness, for modernization, and for pay and\r\nbenefits for our troops and their families.\r\n\r\nYou know, we are the heirs of a legacy of bravery represented in every\r\ncommunity in America by millions of our veterans. America's defenders today\r\nstill stand ready at a moments notice to go where comforts are few and\r\ndangers are many, to do what needs to be done as no one else can. They\r\nalways come through for America. We must come through for them.\r\n\r\nThe new century demands new partnerships for peace and security. The United\r\nNations plays a crucial role, with allies sharing burdens America might\r\notherwise bear alone. America needs a strong and effective U.N. I want to\r\nwork with this new Congress to pay our dues and our debts.\r\n\r\nWe must continue to support security and stability in Europe and Asia--\r\nexpanding NATO and defining its new missions, maintaining our alliance with\r\nJapan, with Korea, with our other Asian allies, and engaging China.\r\n\r\nIn China last year, I said to the leaders and the people what I'd like to\r\nsay again tonight: Stability can no longer be bought at the expense of\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nBut I'd also like to say again to the American people, it's important not\r\nto isolate China. The more we bring China into the world, the more the\r\nworld will bring change and freedom to China.\r\n\r\nLast spring, with some of you, I traveled to Africa, where I saw democracy\r\nand reform rising, but still held back by violence and disease. We must\r\nfortify African democracy and peace by launching radio democracy for\r\nAfrica, supporting the transition to democracy now beginning to take place\r\nin Nigeria, and passing the African Trade and Development Act.\r\n\r\nWe must continue to deepen our ties to the Americas and the Caribbean, our\r\ncommon work to educate children, fight drugs, strengthen democracy and\r\nincrease trade. In this hemisphere, every government but one is freely\r\nchosen by its people. We are determined that Cuba, too, will know the\r\nblessings of liberty.\r\n\r\nThe American people have opened their arms and their hearts and their arms\r\nto our Central American and Caribbean neighbors who have been so devastated\r\nby the recent hurricanes. Working with Congress, I am committed to help\r\nthem rebuild.\r\n\r\nWhen the first lady and Tipper Gore visited the region, they saw thousands\r\nof our troops and thousands of American volunteers. In the Dominican\r\nRepublic, Hillary helped to rededicate a hospital that had been rebuilt by\r\nDominicans and Americans working side by side. With her was some one else\r\nwho has been very important to the relief efforts. You know sports records\r\nare made and sooner or later, they're broken. But making other people's\r\nlives better and showing our children the true meaning of brotherhood, that\r\nlasts forever. So for far more than baseball, Sammy Sosa, you're a hero in\r\ntwo countries tonight. Thank you.\r\n\r\nSo I say to all of you, if we do these things, if we pursue peace, fight\r\nterrorism, increase our strength, renew our alliances, we will begin to\r\nmeet our generation's historic responsibility to build a stronger 21st\r\ncentury America in a freer, more peaceful world.\r\n\r\nAs the world has changed, so have our own communities. We must make the\r\nsafer, more livable, and more united. This year, we will reach our goal of\r\n100,000 community police officers ahead of schedule and under budget.\r\n\r\nThe Brady Bill has stopped a quarter million felons, fugitives, and\r\nstalkers from buying handguns and now, the murder rate is the lowest in 30\r\nyears, and the crime rate has dropped for six straight years.\r\n\r\nTonight, I propose a 21st Century Crime Bill to deploy the latest\r\ntechnologies and tactics to make our communities even safer. Our balanced\r\nbudget will help put up to 50,000 more police on the street in the areas\r\nhardest hit by crime, and then to equip them with new tools from\r\ncrime-mapping computers to digital mug shots. We must break the deadly\r\ncycle of drugs and crime.\r\n\r\nOur budget expands support for drug testing and treatment, saying to\r\nprisoners, \"If you stay on drugs, you have to stay behind bars.\" And to\r\nthose on parole, \"If you want to keep your freedom, you must stay free of\r\ndrugs.\"\r\n\r\nI ask Congress to restore the five-day waiting period for buying a handgun\r\nand extend the Brady Bill to prevent juveniles who commit violent crimes\r\nfrom buying a gun.\r\n\r\nWe must do more to keep our schools the safest places in our communities.\r\nLast year, every American was horrified and heartbroken by the tragic\r\nkillings in Jonesboro, Paducah, Pearl, Edinboro, Springfield. We were\r\ndeeply moved by the courageous parents now working to keep guns out of the\r\nhands of children and to make other efforts so that other parents don't\r\nhave to live through their loss.\r\n\r\nAfter she lost her daughter, Suzann Wilson of Jonesboro, Arkansas, came\r\nhere to the White House with a powerful plea. She said \"Please, please for\r\nthe sake of your children, lock up your guns. Don't let what happened in\r\nJonesboro, happen in your town.\"\r\n\r\nIt's a message she is passionately advocating every day. Suzann is here\r\nwith us tonight, with the first lady. I would like to thank her for her\r\ncourage and her commitment.\r\n\r\nIn memory of all the children who lost their lives to school violence, I\r\nask you to strengthen the Safe And Drug Free School Act, to pass\r\nlegislation to require child trigger locks, to do everything possible to\r\nkeep our children safe.\r\n\r\nToday, we're--excuse me--a century ago, President Theodore Roosevelt\r\ndefined our great central task as leaving this land even a better land for\r\nour descendants than it is for us. Today, we're restoring the Florida\r\nEverglades, saving Yellowstone, preserving the red rock canyons of Utah,\r\nprotecting California's redwoods, and our precious coasts.\r\n\r\nBut our most fateful new challenge is the threat of global warming.\r\nNineteen ninety-eight was the warmest year ever recorded. Last year's heat\r\nwaves, floods and storm are but a hint of what future generations may\r\nendure if we do not act now.\r\n\r\nTonight, I propose a new clean air fund to help communities reduce\r\ngreenhouse and other pollutions, and tax incentives and investment to spur\r\nclean energy technologies. And I want to work with members of Congress in\r\nboth parties to reward companies that take early, voluntary action to\r\nreduce greenhouse gases.\r\n\r\nNow, all our communities face a preservation challenge as they grow, and\r\ngreen space shrinks. Seven thousand acres of farmland and open space are\r\nlost every day. In response, I propose two major initiatives. First, a $1\r\nbillion livability agenda to help communities save open space, ease traffic\r\ncongestion, and grow in ways that enhance every citizen's quality of life.\r\nAnd second, a $1 billion lands legacy initiative to preserve places of\r\nnatural beauty all across America, from the most remote wilderness to the\r\nnearest city park.\r\n\r\nThese are truly landmark initiatives, which could not have been developed\r\nwithout the visionary leadership of the vice president and I want to thank\r\nhim very much for his commitment here. Thank you.\r\n\r\nNow, to get the most out of your community, you have to give something\r\nback. That's why we created AmeriCorps, our national service program that\r\ngives today's generation a chance to serve their communities and earn money\r\nfor college.\r\n\r\nSo far, in just four years, 100,000 young Americans have built low-income\r\nhomes with Habitat for Humanity, helped tutor children with churches, work\r\nwith FEMA to ease the burden of natural disasters and performed countless\r\nother acts of service that has made America better. I ask Congress to give\r\nmore young Americans the chance to follow their lead and serve America in\r\nAmeriCorps.\r\n\r\nNow, we must work to renew our national community as well for the 21st\r\ncentury. Last year, the House passed the bipartisan campaign finance reform\r\nlegislation sponsored by Representatives [Christopher] Shays (R-Conn.) and\r\n[Martin T.] Meehan (D-Mass.) and Sens. [John] McCain (R-Ariz.) and\r\n[Russell] Feingold (D-Wis.). But a partisan minority in the Senate blocked\r\nreform. So I would like to say to the House, pass it again--quickly.\r\n\r\nAnd I'd like to say to the Senate, I hope you will say yes to a stronger\r\nAmerican democracy in the year 2000.\r\n\r\nSince 1997, our Initiative on Race has sought to bridge the divides between\r\nand among our people. In its report last fall, the Initiatives Advisory\r\nBoard found that Americans really do want to bring our people together\r\nacross racial lines.\r\n\r\nWe know it's been a long journey. For some it goes back to before the\r\nbeginning of our republic. For others, back since the Civil War; for\r\nothers, throughout the 21st century. But for most of us alive today, in a\r\nvery real sense this journey began 43 years ago, when a woman named Rosa\r\nParks sat down on a bus in Alabama and wouldn't get up.\r\n\r\nShe's sitting down with the first lady tonight, and she may get up or not\r\nas she chooses.\r\n\r\nWe know that our continuing racial problems are aggravated, as the\r\npresidential initiative said, by opportunity gaps.\r\n\r\nThe initiative I've outlined tonight will help to close them. But we know\r\nthat the discrimination gap has not been fully closed either.\r\nDiscrimination or violence because of race or religion, ancestry or gender,\r\ndisability or sexual orientation, is wrong and it ought to be illegal.\r\nTherefore, I ask Congress to make the Employment Non-Discrimination Act and\r\nthe Hate Crimes Prevention Act the law of the land.\r\n\r\nYou know, now since every person in America counts, every American ought to\r\nbe counted. We need a census that uses modern scientific methods to do\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nOur new immigrants must be part of our one America. After all, they're\r\nrevitalizing our cities, they're energizing our culture, they're building\r\nup our economy. We have a responsibility to make them welcome here, and\r\nthey have a responsibility to enter the mainstream of American life.\r\n\r\nThat means learning English and learning about our democratic system of\r\ngovernment. There are now long waiting lines of immigrants that are trying\r\nto do just that.\r\n\r\nTherefore, our budget significantly expands our efforts to help them meet\r\ntheir responsibility. I hope you will support it.\r\n\r\nWhether our ancestors came here on the Mayflower, on slave ships; whether\r\nthey came to Ellis Island or LAX in Los Angeles; whether they came\r\nyesterday or walked this land 1,000 years ago, our great challenge for the\r\n21st century is to find a way to be one America. We can meet all the other\r\nchallenges if we can go forward as one America.\r\n\r\nYou know, barely more than 300 days from now we will cross that bridge into\r\nthe new millennium. This is a moment, as the first lady has said, to honor\r\nthe past and imagine the future.\r\n\r\nI'd like to take just a minute to honor her, for leading our Millennium\r\nProject, for all she's done for our children. For all she has done in her\r\nhistoric role to serve our nation and our best ideals at home and abroad, I\r\nhonor her.\r\n\r\nLast year--last year I called on Congress and every citizen to mark the\r\nmillennium by saving America's treasures. Hillary's traveled all across the\r\ncountry to inspire recognition and support for saving places like Thomas\r\nEdison's invention factory or Harriet Tubman's home.\r\n\r\nNow we have to preserve our treasures in every community. And tonight,\r\nbefore I close, I want to invite every town, every city, every community to\r\nbecome a nationally recognized millennium community by launching projects\r\nthat save our history, promote our arts and humanities, prepare our\r\nchildren for the 21st century.\r\n\r\nAlready the response has been remarkable. And I want to say a special word\r\nof thanks to our private sector partners and to members in Congress of both\r\nparties for their support. Just one example. Because of you, the Star\r\nSpangled Banner will be preserved for the ages.\r\n\r\nIn ways large and small, as we look to the millennium, we are keeping alive\r\nwhat George Washington called the \"sacred fire of liberty.\"\r\n\r\nSix years ago, I came to office in a time of doubt for America, with our\r\neconomy troubled, our deficit high, our people divided. Some even wondered\r\nwhether our best days were behind us. But across this nation, in a thousand\r\nneighborhoods, I have seen, even amidst the pain and uncertainty of\r\nrecession, the real heart and character of America.\r\n\r\nI knew then we Americans could renew this country.\r\n\r\nTonight, as I deliver the last State of the Union Address for the 20th\r\ncentury, no one anywhere in the world can doubt the enduring resolve and\r\nboundless capacity of the American people to work toward that \"more perfect\r\nunion\" of our founders' dreams.\r\n\r\nWe are now, at the end of a century, when generation after generation of\r\nAmericans answered the call to greatness, overcoming Depression, lifting up\r\nthe dispossessed, bringing down barriers to racial prejudice, building the\r\nlargest middle class in history, winning two world wars and the \"long\r\ntwilight struggle\" of the Cold War.\r\n\r\nWe must all be profoundly grateful for the magnificent achievements of our\r\nforbearers in this century.\r\n\r\nYet perhaps in the daily press of events, in the clash of controversy, we\r\ndon't see our own time for what it truly is--a new dawn for America.\r\n\r\nA hundred years from tonight, another American president will stand in this\r\nplace and report on the State of the Union. He--or she--will look back on\r\nthe 21st century shaped in so many ways by the decisions we make here and\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nSo let it be said of us then that we were thinking not only of our time,\r\nbut of their time; that we reached as high as our ideals; that we put aside\r\nour divisions and found a new hour of healing and hopefulness; that we\r\njoined together to serve and strengthen the land we love.\r\n\r\nMy fellow Americans, this is our moment. Let us lift our eyes as one\r\nnation, and from the mountaintop of this American century, look ahead to\r\nthe next one--asking God's blessing on our endeavors and on our beloved\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThank you, and good evening.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nWilliam J. Clinton\r\nJanuary 27, 2000\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, honored guests, my\r\nfellow Americans:\r\n\r\nWe are fortunate to be alive at this moment in history. Never before has\r\nour nation enjoyed, at once, so much prosperity and social progress with so\r\nlittle internal crisis or so few external threats. Never before have we had\r\nsuch a blessed opportunity--and, therefore, such a profound obligation--\r\nto build the more perfect union of our founders' dreams.\r\n\r\nWe begin the new century with over 20 million new jobs. The fastest\r\neconomic growth in more than 30 years; the lowest unemployment rates in 30\r\nyears; the lowest poverty rates in 20 years; the lowest African-American\r\nand Hispanic unemployment rates on record; the first back-to-back budget\r\nsurpluses in 42 years.\r\n\r\nNext month, America will achieve the longest period of economic growth in\r\nour entire history.\r\n\r\nWe have built a new economy.\r\n\r\nOur economic revolution has been matched by a revival of the American\r\nspirit: Crime down by 20 percent, to its lowest level in 25 years. Teen\r\nbirths down seven years in a row and adoptions up by 30 percent. Welfare\r\nrolls cut in half to their lowest levels in 30 years.\r\n\r\nMy fellow Americans, the state of our union is the strongest it has ever\r\nbeen.\r\n\r\nAs always, the credit belongs to the American people.\r\n\r\nMy gratitude also goes to those of you in this chamber who have worked with\r\nus to put progress above partisanship.\r\n\r\nEight years ago, it was not so clear to most Americans there would be much\r\nto celebrate in the year 2000. Then our nation was gripped by economic\r\ndistress, social decline, political gridlock. The title of a best-selling\r\nbook asked: \"America: What went wrong?\"\r\n\r\nIn the best traditions of our nation, Americans determined to set things\r\nright. We restored the vital center, replacing outdated ideologies with a\r\nnew vision anchored in basic, enduring values: opportunity for all,\r\nresponsibility from all, and a community of all Americans.\r\n\r\nWe reinvented government, transforming it into a catalyst for new ideas\r\nthat stress both opportunity and responsibility, and give our people the\r\ntools to solve their own problems.\r\n\r\nWith the smallest federal workforce in 40 years, we turned record deficits\r\ninto record surpluses, and doubled our investment in education. We cut\r\ncrime: with 100,000 community police and the Brady Law, which has kept guns\r\nout of the hands of half a million criminals.\r\n\r\nWe ended welfare as we knew it--requiring work while protecting health\r\ncare and nutrition for children, and investing more in child care,\r\ntransportation, and housing to help their parents go to work. We have\r\nhelped parents to succeed at work and at home--with family leave, which 20\r\nmillion Americans have used to care for a newborn child or a sick loved\r\none. We have engaged 150,000 young Americans in citizen service through\r\nAmeriCorps--while also helping them earn their way through college.\r\n\r\nIn 1992, we had a roadmap. Today, we have results. More important, America\r\nagain has the confidence to dream big dreams. But we must not let our\r\nrenewed confidence grow into complacency. We will be judged by the dreams\r\nand deeds we pass on to our children. And on that score, we will be held to\r\na high standard, indeed. Because our chance to do good is so great.\r\n\r\nMy fellow Americans, we have crossed the bridge we built to the 21st\r\nCentury. Now, we must shape a 21st-Century American revolution--of\r\nopportunity, responsibility, and community. We must be, as we were in the\r\nbeginning, a new nation.\r\n\r\nAt the dawn of the last century, Theodore Roosevelt said, \"the one\r\ncharacteristic more essential than any other is foresight. . . It should be\r\nthe growing nation with a future which takes the long look ahead.\"\r\n\r\nTonight let us take our look long ahead--and set great goals for our\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nTo 21st Century America, let us pledge that:\r\n\r\nEvery child will begin school ready to learn and graduate ready to succeed.\r\nEvery family will be able to succeed at home and at work--and no child\r\nwill be raised in poverty. We will meet the challenge of the aging of\r\nAmerica. We will assure quality, affordable healthcare for all Americans.\r\nWe will make America the safest big country on earth. We will bring\r\nprosperity to every American community. We will reverse the course of\r\nclimate change and leave a cleaner, safer planet. America will lead the\r\nworld toward shared peace and prosperity, and the far frontiers of science\r\nand technology. And we will become at last what our founders pledged us to\r\nbe so long ago--one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and\r\njustice for all.\r\n\r\nThese are great goals, worthy of a great nation. We will not reach them all\r\nthis year. Not even in this decade. But we will reach them. Let us remember\r\nthat the first American revolution was not won with a single shot. The\r\ncontinent was not settled in a single year. The lesson of our history--and\r\nthe lesson of the last seven years--is that great goals are reached step\r\nby step: always building on our progress, always gaining ground.\r\n\r\nOf course, you can't gain ground if you're standing still. For too long\r\nthis Congress has been standing still on some of our most pressing national\r\npriorities. Let's begin with them.\r\n\r\nI ask you again to pass a real patient's bill of rights. Pass common-sense\r\ngun-safety legislation. Pass campaign finance reform. Vote on long overdue\r\njudicial nominations and other important appointees. And, again, I ask you\r\nto raise the minimum wage.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago, as we reached our first balanced budget, I asked that we\r\nmeet our responsibility to the next generation by maintaining our fiscal\r\ndiscipline. Because we refused to stray from that path, we are doing\r\nsomething that would have seemed unimaginable seven years ago: We are\r\nactually paying down the national debt. If we stay on this path, we can pay\r\ndown the debt entirely in 13 years and make America debt-free for the first\r\ntime since Andrew Jackson was president in 1835.\r\n\r\nIn 1993, we began to put our fiscal house in order with the Deficit\r\nReduction Act, winning passage in both houses by just one vote. Your former\r\ncolleague, my first Secretary of the Treasury, led that effort. He is here\r\ntonight. Lloyd Bentsen, you have served America well.\r\n\r\nBeyond paying off the debt, we must ensure that the benefits of debt\r\nreduction go to preserving two of the most important guarantees we make to\r\nevery American--Social Security and Medicare. I ask you tonight to work\r\nwith me to make a bipartisan down payment on Social Security reform by\r\ncrediting the interest savings from debt reduction to the Social Security\r\nTrust Fund to ensure that it is strong and sound for the next 50 years.\r\n\r\nBut this is just the start of our journey. Now we must take the right steps\r\ntoward reaching our great goals.\r\n\r\nOpportunity and Responsibility in Education\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, we need a 21st Century revolution in education, guided\r\nby our faith that every child can learn. Because education is more than\r\never the key to our children's future, we must make sure all our children\r\nhave that key. That means quality preschool and afterschool, the best\r\ntrained teachers in every classroom, and college opportunities for all our\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nFor seven years, we have worked hard to improve our schools, with\r\nopportunity and responsibility: Investing more, but demanding more in\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nReading, math, and college entrance scores are up. And some of the most\r\nimpressive gains are in schools in poor neighborhoods.\r\n\r\nAll successful schools have followed the same proven formula: higher\r\nstandards, more accountability, so all children can reach those standards.\r\nI have sent Congress a reform plan based on that formula. It holds states\r\nand school districts accountable for progress, and rewards them for\r\nresults. Each year, the national government invests more than $15 billion\r\nin our schools. It's time to support what works and stop supporting what\r\ndoesn't.\r\n\r\nAs we demand more than ever from our schools, we should invest more than\r\never in our schools.\r\n\r\nLet's double our investment to help states and districts turn around their\r\nworst-performing schools--or shut them down.\r\n\r\nLet's double our investment in afterschool and summer school programs--\r\nboosting achievement, and keeping children off the street and out of\r\ntrouble. If we do, we can give every child in every failing school in\r\nAmerica the chance to meet high standards.\r\n\r\nSince 1993, we've nearly doubled our investment in Head Start and improved\r\nits quality. Tonight, I ask for another $1 billion to Head Start, the\r\nlargest increase in the program's history.\r\n\r\nWe know that children learn best in smaller classes with good teachers. For\r\ntwo years in a row, Congress has supported my plan to hire 100,000 new,\r\nqualified teachers, to lower class sizes in the early grades. This year, I\r\nask you to make it three in a row.\r\n\r\nAnd to make sure all teachers know the subjects they teach, tonight I\r\npropose a new teacher quality initiative--to recruit more talented people\r\ninto the classroom, reward good teachers for staying there, and give all\r\nteachers the training they need.\r\n\r\nWe know charter schools provide real public school choice. When I became\r\nPresident, there was just one independent public charter school in all\r\nAmerica. Today there are 1,700. I ask you to help us meet our goal of 3,000\r\nby next year.\r\n\r\nWe know we must connect all our classrooms to the Internet. We're getting\r\nthere. In 1994, only three percent of our classrooms were connected. Today,\r\nwith the help of the Vice President's E-rate program, more than half of\r\nthem are; and 90 percent of our schools have at least one connection to the\r\nInternet.\r\n\r\nBut we can't finish the job when a third of all schools are in serious\r\ndisrepair, many with walls and wires too old for the Internet. Tonight, I\r\npropose to help 5,000 schools a year make immediate, urgent repairs. And\r\nagain, to help build or modernize 6,000 schools, to get students out of\r\ntrailers and into high-tech classrooms.\r\n\r\nWe should double our bipartisan GEAR UP program to mentor 1.4 million\r\ndisadvantaged young people for college. And let's offer these students a\r\nchance to take the same college test-prep courses wealthier students use to\r\nboost their test scores.\r\n\r\nTo make the American Dream achievable for all, we must make college\r\naffordable for all. For seven years, on a bipartisan basis, we have taken\r\naction toward that goal: larger Pell grants, more-affordable student loans,\r\neducation IRAs, and our HOPE scholarships, which have already benefited 5\r\nmillion young people. 67 percent of high school graduates now go on to\r\ncollege, up almost 10 percent since 1993. Yet millions of families still\r\nstrain to pay college tuition. They need help.\r\n\r\nI propose a landmark $30-billion college opportunity tax cut--a\r\nmiddle-class tax deduction for up to $10,000 in college tuition costs.\r\nWe've already made two years of college affordable for all. Now let's make\r\nfour years of college affordable for all.\r\n\r\nIf we take all these steps, we will move a long way toward making sure\r\nevery child starts school ready to learn and graduates ready to succeed.\r\n\r\nRewarding Work and Strengthening Families\r\n\r\nWe need a 21st Century revolution to reward work and strengthen families--\r\nby giving every parent the tools to succeed at work and at the most\r\nimportant work of all--raising their children. That means making sure that\r\nevery family has health care and the support to care for aging parents, the\r\ntools to bring their children up right, and that no child grows up in\r\npoverty.\r\n\r\nFrom my first days as President, we have worked to give families better\r\naccess to better health care. In 1997, we passed the Children's Health\r\nInsurance Program--CHIP--so that workers who don't have health care\r\ncoverage through their employers at least can get it for their children. So\r\nfar, we've enrolled 2 million children, and we're well on our way to our\r\ngoal of 5 million.\r\n\r\nBut there are still more than 40 million Americans without health\r\ninsurance, more than there were in 1993. Tonight I propose that we follow\r\nVice President Gore's suggestion to make low income parents eligible for\r\nthe insurance that covers their kids. Together with our children's\r\ninitiative, we can cover nearly one quarter of the uninsured in America.\r\n\r\nAgain, I ask you to let people between 55 and 65--the fastest growing\r\ngroup of uninsured--buy into Medicare. And let's give them a tax credit to\r\nmake that choice an affordable one.\r\n\r\nWhen the Baby Boomers retire, Medicare will be faced with caring for twice\r\nas many of our citizens--and yet it is far from ready to do so. My\r\ngeneration must not ask our children's generation to shoulder our burden.\r\nWe must strengthen and modernize Medicare now.\r\n\r\nMy budget includes a comprehensive plan to reform Medicare, to make it more\r\nefficient and competitive. And it dedicates nearly $400 billion of our\r\nbudget surplus to keep Medicare solvent past 2025; and, at long last, to\r\ngive every senior a voluntary choice of affordable coverage for\r\nprescription drugs.\r\n\r\nLifesaving drugs are an indispensable part of modern medicine. No one\r\ncreating a Medicare program today would even consider excluding coverage\r\nfor prescription drugs. Yet more than three in five seniors now lack\r\ndependable drug coverage which can lengthen and enrich their lives.\r\nMillions of older Americans who need prescription drugs the most pay the\r\nhighest prices for them.\r\n\r\nIn good conscience, we cannot let another year pass without extending to\r\nall seniors the lifeline of affordable prescription drugs.\r\n\r\nRecord numbers of Americans are providing for aging or ailing loved ones at\r\nhome. Last year, I proposed a $1,000 tax credit for long-term care.\r\nFrankly, that wasn't enough. This year, let's triple it to $3,000--and\r\nthis year, let's pass it.\r\n\r\nAnd we must make needed investments to expand access to mental health care.\r\nI want to thank the person who has led our efforts to break down the\r\nbarriers to the decent treatment of mental illness: Tipper Gore.\r\n\r\nTaken together, these proposals would mark the largest investment in health\r\ncare in the 35 years since the creation of Medicare--a big step toward\r\nassuring health care for all Americans, young and old.\r\n\r\nWe must also make investments that reward work and support families.\r\nNothing does that better than the Earned Income Tax Credit, the EITC. The\r\n\"E\" in \"EITC\" is about earning; working; taking responsibility and being\r\nrewarded for it. In my first Address to you, I asked Congress to greatly\r\nexpand this tax credit; and you did. As a result, in 1998 alone, the EITC\r\nhelped more than 4.3 million Americans work their way out of poverty and\r\ntoward the middle class--double the number in 1993.\r\n\r\nTonight, I propose another major expansion. We should reduce the marriage\r\npenalty for the EITC, making sure it rewards marriage just as it rewards\r\nwork. And we should expand the tax credit for families with more than two\r\nchildren to provide up to $1,100 more in tax relief.\r\n\r\nWe can't reward work and family unless men and women get equal pay for\r\nequal work. The female unemployment rate is the lowest in 46 years. Yet\r\nwomen still earn only about 75 cents for every dollar men earn. We must do\r\nbetter by providing the resources to enforce present equal pay laws,\r\ntraining more women for high-paying, high-tech jobs, and passing the\r\nPaycheck Fairness Act.\r\n\r\nTwo-thirds of new jobs are in the suburbs, far away from many low-income\r\nfamilies. In the past two years, I have proposed and Congress has approved\r\n110,000 new housing vouchers--rent subsidies to help working families live\r\ncloser to the workplace. This year, let us more than double that number. If\r\nwe want people to go to work, they have to be able to get to work.\r\n\r\nMany working parents spend up to a quarter of their income on child care.\r\nLast year, we helped parents provide child care for about two million\r\nchildren. My child care initiative, along with funds already secured in\r\nwelfare reform, would make child care better, safer, and more affordable\r\nfor another 400,000 children.\r\n\r\nFor hard-pressed middle-income families, we should also expand the child\r\ncare tax credit. And we should take the next big step. We should make that\r\ntax credit refundable for low-income families. For those making under\r\n$30,000 a year, that could mean up to $2,400 for child-care costs. We all\r\nsay we're pro-work and pro-family. Passing this proposal would prove it.\r\n\r\nTens of millions of Americans live from paycheck to paycheck. As hard as\r\nthey work, they still don't have the opportunity to save. Too few can make\r\nuse of IRAs and 401-K retirement plans. We should do more to help working\r\nfamilies save and accumulate wealth. That's the idea behind so-called\r\nIndividual Development Accounts. Let's take that idea to a new level, with\r\nRetirement Savings Accounts that enable every low- and moderate-income\r\nfamily in America to save for retirement, a first home, a medical\r\nemergency, or a college education. I propose to match their contributions,\r\nhowever small, dollar for dollar, every year they save. And to give a major\r\nnew tax credit for any small business that provides a meaningful pension to\r\nits workers.\r\n\r\nNearly one in three American children grows up in a home without a father.\r\nThese children are five times more likely to live in poverty than children\r\nwith both parents at home. Clearly, demanding and supporting responsible\r\nfatherhood is critical to lifting all children out of poverty.\r\n\r\nWe have doubled child support collections since 1992, and I am proposing\r\ntough new measures to hold still more fathers responsible. But we should\r\nrecognize that a lot of fathers want to do right by their children--and\r\nneed help to do it. Carlos Rosas of St. Paul, Minnesota, got that help. Now\r\nhe has a good job and he supports his son Ricardo. My budget will help\r\n40,000 fathers make the choices Carlos did. And I thank him for being\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nIf there is any issue on which we can reach across party lines it is in our\r\ncommon commitment to reward work and strengthen families. Thanks to\r\noverwhelming bipartisan support from this Congress, we have improved foster\r\ncare, supported those who leave it when they turn eighteen, and\r\ndramatically increased the number of foster children going to adoptive\r\nhomes. I thank you for that. Of course, I am especially grateful to the\r\nperson who has led our efforts from the beginning, and who has worked\r\ntirelessly for children and families for thirty years now: my wife,\r\nHillary.\r\n\r\nIf we take all these steps, we will move a long way toward empowering\r\nparents to succeed at home and at work and ensuring that no child is raised\r\nin poverty. We can make these vital investments in health care, education\r\nand support for working families--and still offer tax cuts to help pay for\r\ncollege, for retirement, to care for aging parents and reduce the marriage\r\npenalty--without forsaking the path of fiscal discipline that got us here.\r\nIndeed, we must make these investments and tax cuts in the context of a\r\nbalanced budget that strengthens and extends the life of Social Security\r\nand Medicare and pays down the national debt.\r\n\r\nResponsibility and Crime\r\n\r\nCrime in America has dropped for the past seven years--the longest decline\r\non record, thanks to a national consensus we helped to forge on community\r\npolice, sensible gun safety laws, and effective prevention. But nobody\r\nbelieves America is safe enough. So let's set a higher goal: let's make\r\nAmerica the safest big country in the world.\r\n\r\nLast fall, Congress supported my plan to hire--in addition to the 100,000\r\ncommunity police we have already funded--50,000 more, concentrated in\r\nhigh-crime neighborhoods. I ask your continued support.\r\n\r\nSoon after the Columbine tragedy, Congress considered common-sense gun\r\nsafety legislation to require Brady background checks at gun shows, child\r\nsafety locks for all new handguns, and a ban on the importation of\r\nlarge-capacity ammunition clips. With courage--and a tie-breaking vote by\r\nthe Vice President--the Senate faced down the gun lobby, stood up for the\r\nAmerican people, and passed this legislation. But the House failed to\r\nfollow suit.\r\n\r\nWe've all seen what happens when guns fall into the wrong hands. Daniel\r\nMauser was only 15 years old when he was gunned down at Columbine. He was\r\nan amazing kid, a straight-A student, a good skier. Like all parents who\r\nlose their children, his father Tom has borne unimaginable grief. Somehow\r\nTom has found the strength to honor his son by transforming his grief into\r\naction. Earlier this month, he took a leave of absence from his job to\r\nfight for tougher gun safety laws. I pray that his courage and wisdom will\r\nmove this Congress to make common-sense gun safety legislation the very\r\nnext order of business. Tom, thank you for being here tonight.\r\n\r\nWe must strengthen gun laws and better enforce laws already on the books.\r\nFederal gun crime prosecutions are up 16 percent since I took office. But\r\nagain, we must do more. I propose to hire more federal and local gun\r\nprosecutors, and more ATF agents to crack down on illegal gun traffickers\r\nand bad-apple dealers. And we must give law enforcement the tools to trace\r\nevery gun--and every bullet--used in a crime in America.\r\n\r\nListen to this: the accidental gun death rate of children under 15 in the\r\nUnited States is nine times higher than in the other 25 industrialized\r\nnations--combined. Technologies now exist that could lead to guns that can\r\nonly be fired by the adults who own them. I ask Congress to fund research\r\nin Smart Gun technology. I also call on responsible leaders in the gun\r\nindustry to work with us on smart guns and other steps to keep guns out of\r\nthe wrong hands and keep our children safe.\r\n\r\nEvery parent I know worries about the impact of violence in the media on\r\ntheir children. I thank the entertainment industry for accepting my\r\nchallenge to put voluntary ratings on TV programs and video and Internet\r\ngames. But the ratings are too numerous, diverse, and confusing to be\r\nreally useful to parents. Therefore, I now ask the industry to accept the\r\nFirst Lady's challenge--to develop a single, voluntary rating system for\r\nall children's entertainment, one that is easier for parents to understand\r\nand enforce.\r\n\r\nIf we take all these steps, we will be well on our way to making America\r\nthe safest big country in the world.\r\n\r\nOpening New Markets\r\n\r\nTo keep our historic economic expansion going, we need a 21st Century\r\nrevolution to open new markets, start new businesses, and hire new workers\r\nright here in America--in our inner cities, poor rural areas, and on\r\nIndian reservations.\r\n\r\nOur nation's prosperity has not yet reached these places. Over the last six\r\nmonths, I have traveled to many of them--joined by many of you, and many\r\nfar-sighted business people--to shine a spotlight on the enormous\r\npotential in communities from Appalachia to the Mississippi Delta, from\r\nWatts to the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. Everywhere I've gone, I've met\r\ntalented people eager for opportunity, and able to work. Let's put them to\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nFor business, it's the smart thing to do. For America, it's the right thing\r\nto do. And if we don't do it now, when will we ever get around to it?\r\n\r\nI ask Congress to give businesses the same incentives to invest in\r\nAmerica's new markets that they now have to invest in foreign markets.\r\nTonight, I propose a large New Markets Tax Credit and other incentives to\r\nspur $22 billion in private-sector capital--to create new businesses and\r\nnew investments in inner cities and rural areas.\r\n\r\nEmpowerment Zones have been creating these opportunities for five years\r\nnow. We should also increase incentives to invest in them and create more\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nThis is not a Democratic or a Republican issue. It is an American issue.\r\nMr. Speaker, it was a powerful moment last November when you joined me and\r\nthe Reverend Jesse Jackson in your home state of Illinois, and committed to\r\nworking toward our common goal, by combining the best ideas from both sides\r\nof the aisle. Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working with you.\r\n\r\nWe must maintain our commitment to community development banks and keep the\r\ncommunity reinvestment act strong so all Americans have access to the\r\ncapital they need to buy homes and build businesses.\r\n\r\nWe need to make special efforts to address the areas with the highest rates\r\nof poverty. My budget includes a special $110 million initiative to promote\r\neconomic development in the Mississippi Delta; and $1 billion to increase\r\neconomic opportunity, health care, education and law enforcement for Native\r\nAmerican communities. In this new century, we should honor our historic\r\nresponsibility to empower the first Americans. I thank leaders and members\r\nfrom both parties who have already expressed an interest in working with us\r\non these efforts.\r\n\r\nThere's another part of our American community in trouble today--our\r\nfamily farmers. When I signed the Farm Bill in 1996, I said there was a\r\ngreat danger it would work well in good times but not in bad. Well,\r\ndroughts, floods, and historically low prices have made times very bad for\r\nour farmers. We must work together to strengthen the farm safety net,\r\ninvest in land conservation, and create new markets by expanding our\r\nprogram for bio-based fuels and products.\r\n\r\nToday, opportunity for all requires something new: having access to a\r\ncomputer and knowing how to use it. That means we must close the digital\r\ndivide between those who have these tools and those who don't.\r\n\r\nConnecting classrooms and libraries to the Internet is crucial, but it's\r\njust a start. My budget ensures that all new teachers are trained to teach\r\n21st Century skills and creates technology centers in 1,000 communities to\r\nserve adults. This spring, I will invite high-tech leaders to join me on\r\nanother New Markets tour--to close the digital divide and open opportunity\r\nfor all our people. I thank the high-tech companies that are already doing\r\nso much in this area--and I hope the new tax incentives I have proposed\r\nwill encourage others to join us.\r\n\r\nIf we take these steps, we will go a long way toward our goal of bringing\r\nopportunity to every community.\r\n\r\nGlobal Change and American Leadership\r\n\r\nTo realize the full possibilities of the new economy, we must reach beyond\r\nour own borders, to shape the revolution that is tearing down barriers and\r\nbuilding new networks among nations and individuals, economies and\r\ncultures: globalization.\r\n\r\nIt is the central reality of our time. Change this profound is both\r\nliberating and threatening. But there is no turning back. And our open,\r\ncreative society stands to benefit more than any other--if we understand,\r\nand act on, the new realities of interdependence. We must be at the center\r\nof every vital global network, as a good neighbor and partner. We cannot\r\nbuild our future without helping others to build theirs.\r\n\r\nFirst, we must forge a new consensus on trade. Those of us who believe\r\npassionately in the power of open trade must ensure that it lifts both our\r\nliving standards and our values, never tolerating abusive child labor or a\r\nrace to the bottom on the environment and worker protection. Still, open\r\nmarkets and rules-based trade are the best engines we know for raising\r\nliving standards, reducing global poverty and environmental destruction,\r\nand assuring the free flow of ideas. There is only one direction for\r\nAmerica on trade: we must go forward.\r\n\r\nAnd we must make developing economies our partners in prosperity--which is\r\nwhy I ask Congress to finalize our groundbreaking African and Caribbean\r\nBasin trade initiatives.\r\n\r\nGlobalization is about more than economics. Our purpose must be to bring\r\nthe world together around democracy, freedom, and peace, and to oppose\r\nthose who would tear it apart.\r\n\r\nHere are the fundamental challenges I believe America must meet to shape\r\nthe 21st Century world.\r\n\r\nFirst, we must continue to encourage our former adversaries, Russia and\r\nChina, to emerge as stable, prosperous, democratic nations. Both are being\r\nheld back from reaching their full potential: Russia by the legacy of\r\ncommunism, economic turmoil, a cruel and self-defeating war in Chechnya;\r\nChina by the illusion that it can buy stability at the expense of freedom.\r\nBut think how much has changed in the past decade: thousands of former\r\nSoviet nuclear weapons eliminated; Russian soldiers serving with ours in\r\nthe Balkans; Russian people electing their leaders for the first time in a\r\nthousand years. And in China, an economy more open to the world than ever\r\nbefore. No one can know for sure what direction these great countries will\r\nchoose. But we must do everything in our power to increase the chance they\r\nwill choose wisely, to be constructive members of the global community.\r\n\r\nThat is why we must support those Russians struggling for a democratic,\r\nprosperous future; continue to reduce both our nuclear arsenals; and help\r\nRussia safeguard weapons and materials that remain.\r\n\r\nThat is why Congress should support the agreement we negotiated to bring\r\nChina into the WTO, by passing Permanent Normal Trade Relations as soon as\r\npossible this year. Our markets are already open to China. This agreement\r\nwill open China's markets to us. And it will advance the cause of peace in\r\nAsia and promote the cause of change in China.\r\n\r\nA second challenge is to protect our security from conflicts that pose the\r\nrisk of wider war and threaten our common humanity. America cannot prevent\r\nevery conflict or stop every outrage. But where our interests are at stake\r\nand we can make a difference, we must be peacemakers.\r\n\r\nWe should be proud of America's role in bringing the Middle East closer\r\nthan ever to a comprehensive peace; building peace in Northern Ireland;\r\nworking for peace in East Timor and Africa; promoting reconciliation\r\nbetween Greece and Turkey and in Cyprus; working to defuse crises between\r\nIndia and Pakistan; defending human rights and religious freedom.\r\n\r\nAnd we should be proud of the men and women of our armed forces and those\r\nof our allies who stopped the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo--enabling a\r\nmillion innocent people to return to their homes.\r\n\r\nWhen Slobodan Milosevic unleashed his terror on Kosovo, Captain John\r\nCherrey was one of the brave airmen who turned the tide. And when another\r\nAmerican plane went down over Serbia, he flew into the teeth of enemy air\r\ndefenses to bring his fellow pilot home. Thanks to our armed forces' skill\r\nand bravery, we prevailed without losing a single American in combat.\r\nCaptain Cherrey, we honor you, and promise to finish the job you began.\r\n\r\nA third challenge is to keep the inexorable march of technology from giving\r\nterrorists and potentially hostile nations the means to undermine our\r\ndefenses. The same advances that have shrunk cell phones to fit in the\r\npalms of our hands can also make weapons of terror easier to conceal and\r\neasier to use.\r\n\r\nWe must meet this threat: by making effective agreements to restrain\r\nnuclear and missile programs in North Korea, curbing the flow of lethal\r\ntechnology to Iran; preventing Iraq from threatening its neighbors;\r\nincreasing our preparedness against chemical and biological attack;\r\nprotecting our vital computer systems from hackers and criminals; and\r\ndeveloping a system to defend against new missile threats--while working\r\nto preserve our Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with Russia.\r\n\r\nI hope we can have a constructive bipartisan dialogue this year to build a\r\nconsensus which will lead eventually to the ratification of the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.\r\n\r\nA fourth challenge is to ensure that the stability of our planet is not\r\nthreatened by the huge gulf between rich and poor. We cannot accept a world\r\nin which part of humanity lives on the cutting edge of a new economy, while\r\nthe rest live on the bare edge of survival. We must do our part, with\r\nexpanded trade, expanded aid, and the expansion of freedom.\r\n\r\nFrom Nigeria to Indonesia, more people won the right to choose their\r\nleaders in 1999 than in 1989, the year the Berlin Wall fell. We must stand\r\nby democracies--like Colombia, fighting narco-traffickers for its people's\r\nlives, and our children's lives. I have proposed a strong two-year package\r\nto help Colombia win this fight; and I ask for your support. And I will\r\npropose tough new legislation to go after what drug barons value most--\r\ntheir money.\r\n\r\nIn a world where 1.2 billion people live on less than a dollar a day, we\r\nmust do our part in the global endeavor to reduce the debts of the poorest\r\ncountries so they can invest in education, health and economic growth--as\r\nthe Pope and other religious leaders have urged. Last year, Congress made a\r\ndown payment on America's share. And I ask for your continued support.\r\n\r\nAnd America must help more nations break the bonds of disease. Last year in\r\nAfrica, AIDS killed ten times as many people as war did. My budget invests\r\n$150 million more in the fight against this and other infectious killers.\r\nToday, I propose a tax credit to speed the development of vaccines for\r\ndiseases like malaria, TB and AIDS. I ask the private sector and our\r\npartners around the world to join us in embracing this cause. Together, we\r\ncan save millions of lives.\r\n\r\nOur final challenge is the most important: to pass a national security\r\nbudget that keeps our military the best trained and best equipped in the\r\nworld, with heightened readiness and 21st Century weapons; raises salaries\r\nfor our service men and women; protects our veterans; fully funds the\r\ndiplomacy that keeps our soldiers out of war; and makes good on our\r\ncommitment to pay our UN dues and arrears. I ask you to pass this budget\r\nand I thank you for the extraordinary support you have given--Republicans\r\nand Democrats alike--to our men and women in uniform. I especially want to\r\nthank Secretary Cohen for symbolizing our bipartisan commitment to our\r\nnational security--and Janet Cohen, I thank you for tirelessly traveling\r\nthe world to show our support for the troops.\r\n\r\nIf we meet all these challenges, America can lead the world toward peace\r\nand freedom in an era of globalization.\r\n\r\nResponsibility, Opportunity, and the Environment\r\n\r\nI am grateful for the opportunities the Vice President and I have had to\r\nwork hard to protect the environment and finally to put to rest the notion\r\nthat you can't expand the economy while protecting the environment. As our\r\neconomy has grown, we have rid more than 500 neighborhoods of toxic waste\r\nand ensured cleaner air and water for millions of families. In the past\r\nthree months alone, we have acted to preserve more than 40 million acres of\r\nroadless lands in our National Forests and created three new National\r\nMonuments.\r\n\r\nBut as our communities grow, our commitment to conservation must grow as\r\nwell. Tonight, I propose creating a permanent conservation fund to restore\r\nwildlife, protect coastlines, and save natural treasures from California\r\nredwoods to the Everglades. This Lands Legacy endowment represents by far\r\nthe most enduring investment in land preservation ever proposed.\r\n\r\nLast year, the Vice President launched a new effort to help make\r\ncommunities more livable--so children will grow up next to parks, not\r\nparking lots, and parents can be home with their children instead of stuck\r\nin traffic. Tonight, we propose new funding for advanced transit systems--\r\nfor saving precious open spaces--for helping major cities around the Great\r\nLakes protect their waterways and enhance their quality of life.\r\n\r\nThe greatest environmental challenge of the new century is global warming.\r\nScientists tell us that the 1990s were the hottest decade of the entire\r\nmillennium. If we fail to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, deadly heat\r\nwaves and droughts will become more frequent, coastal areas will be\r\nflooded, economies disrupted.\r\n\r\nMany people in the United States and around the world still believe we\r\ncan't cut greenhouse gas pollution without slowing economic growth. In the\r\nIndustrial Age that may have been true. In the digital economy, it isn't.\r\nNew technologies make it possible to cut harmful emissions and provide even\r\nmore growth. For example, just last week, automakers unveiled cars that get\r\n70 to 80 miles a gallon--the fruits of a unique research partnership\r\nbetween government and industry. Before you know it, efficient production\r\nof biofuels will give us the equivalent of hundreds of miles from a gallon\r\nof gas.\r\n\r\nTo speed innovations in environmental technologies, I propose giving major\r\ntax incentives to businesses for the production of clean energy--and to\r\nfamilies for buying energy-saving homes and appliances and the next\r\ngeneration of super-efficient cars when they hit the showroom floor. I also\r\ncall on the auto industry to use available technologies to make all new\r\ncars more fuel efficient right away. And on Congress to make more of our\r\nclean-energy technologies available to the developing world--creating\r\ncleaner growth abroad and new jobs at home.\r\n\r\nThe Opportunity and Responsibility of Science and Technology\r\n\r\nIn the new century, innovations in science and technology will be the key\r\nnot only to the health of the environment but to miraculous improvements in\r\nthe quality of our lives and advances in the economy.\r\n\r\nLater this year, researchers will complete the first draft of the entire\r\nhuman genome--the very blueprint of life. It is important for all\r\nAmericans to recognize that your tax dollars have fueled this research--\r\nand that this and other wise investments in science are leading to a\r\nrevolution in our ability to detect, treat, and prevent disease.\r\n\r\nFor example, researchers have identified genes that cause Parkinson's\r\nDisease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer--and they are designing\r\nprecision therapies that will block the harmful effects of these faulty\r\ngenes for good. Researchers are already using this new technique to target\r\nand destroy cells that cause breast cancer. Soon, we may be able to use it\r\nto prevent the onset of Alzheimer's Disease. Scientists are also working on\r\nan artificial retina to help many blind people to see and microchips that\r\nwould directly stimulate damaged spinal cords and allow people who are now\r\nparalyzed to stand up and walk.\r\n\r\nScience and engineering innovations are also propelling our remarkable\r\nprosperity. Information technology alone now accounts for a third of our\r\neconomic growth, with jobs that pay almost 80 percent above the private\r\nsector average. Again, we should keep in mind: government-funded research\r\nbrought supercomputers, the Internet, and communications satellites into\r\nbeing. Soon researchers will bring us devices that can translate foreign\r\nlanguages as fast as you can speak; materials 10 times stronger than steel\r\nat a fraction of the weight; and molecular computers the size of a teardrop\r\nwith the power of today's fastest supercomputers.\r\n\r\nTo accelerate the march of discovery across all disciplines of science and\r\ntechnology, my budget includes an unprecedented $3 billion increase in the\r\n21st Century Research Fund, the largest increase in civilian research in a\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\nThese new breakthroughs must be used in ways that reflect our most\r\ncherished values. First and foremost, we must safeguard our citizens'\r\nprivacy. Last year, we proposed rules to protect every citizen's medical\r\nrecords. This year, we will finalize those rules. We have also taken the\r\nfirst steps to protect the privacy of bank and credit card statements and\r\nother financial records. Soon I will send legislation to the Congress to\r\nfinish that job. We must also act to prevent any genetic discrimination by\r\nemployers or insurers.\r\n\r\nThese steps will allow America to lead toward the far frontiers of science\r\nand technology--enhancing our health, environment, and economy in ways we\r\ncannot even imagine today.\r\n\r\nCommunity\r\n\r\nAt a time when science, technology and the forces of globalization are\r\nbringing so many changes into our lives, it is more important than ever\r\nthat we strengthen the bonds that root us in our local communities and in\r\nour national communities.\r\n\r\nNo tie binds different people together like citizen service. There is a new\r\nspirit of service in America--a movement we have supported with\r\nAmeriCorps, an expanded Peace Corps, and unprecedented new partnerships\r\nwith businesses, foundations, and community groups. Partnerships to enlist\r\n12,000 companies in moving 650,000 of our fellow citizens from welfare to\r\nwork. To battle drug abuse and AIDS. To teach young people to read. To Save\r\nAmerica's Treasures. To strengthen the arts. To fight teen pregnancy. To\r\nprevent youth violence. To promote racial healing.\r\n\r\nWe can do even more to help Americans help each other. We should help\r\nfaith-based organizations do more to fight poverty and drug abuse and help\r\nyoung people get back on the right track with initiatives like Second\r\nChance Homes to help unwed teen mothers. We should support Americans who\r\ntithe and contribute to charities, but don't earn enough to claim a tax\r\ndeduction for it. Tonight, I propose new tax incentives to allow low- and\r\nmiddle-income citizens to get that deduction.\r\n\r\nWe should do more to help new immigrants fully participate in the American\r\ncommunity--investing more to teach them civics and English. And since\r\neveryone in our community counts, we must make sure everyone is counted in\r\nthis year's census.\r\n\r\nWithin ten years there will be no majority race in our largest state,\r\nCalifornia. In a little more than 50 years, there will be no majority race\r\nin America. In a more interconnected world, this diversity can be our\r\ngreatest strength. Just look around this chamber. We have members from\r\nvirtually every racial, ethnic, and religious background. And America is\r\nstronger for it. But as we have seen, these differences all too often spark\r\nhatred and division, even here at home.\r\n\r\nWe have seen a man dragged to death in Texas simply because he was black. A\r\nyoung man murdered in Wyoming simply because he was gay. In the last year\r\nalone, we've seen the shootings of African Americans, Asian Americans, and\r\nJewish children simply because of who they were. This is not the American\r\nway. We must draw the line. Without delay, we must pass the Hate Crimes\r\nPrevention Act and the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. And we should\r\nreauthorize the Violence Against Women Act.\r\n\r\nNo American should be subjected to discrimination in finding a home,\r\ngetting a job, going to school, or securing a loan. Tonight, I propose the\r\nlargest ever investment to enforce America's civil rights laws. Protections\r\nin law must be protections in fact.\r\n\r\nLast February, I created the White House Office of One America to promote\r\nracial reconciliation. That's what Hank Aaron, has done all his life. From\r\nhis days as baseball's all-time homerun king to his recent acts of healing,\r\nhe has always brought Americans together. We're pleased he's with us\r\ntonight.\r\n\r\nThis fall, at the White House, one of America's leading scientists said\r\nsomething we should all remember. He said all human beings, genetically,\r\nare 99.9 percent the same. So modern science affirms what ancient faith has\r\nalways taught: the most important fact of life is our common humanity.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we must do more than tolerate diversity--we must honor it and\r\ncelebrate it.\r\n\r\nMy fellow Americans, each time I prepare for the State of the Union, I\r\napproach it with great hope and expectations for our nation. But tonight is\r\nspecial--because we stand on the mountaintop of a new millennium. Behind\r\nus we see the great expanse of American achievement; before us, even\r\ngrander frontiers of possibility.\r\n\r\nWe should be filled with gratitude and humility for our prosperity and\r\nprogress; with awe and joy at what lies ahead; and with absolute\r\ndetermination to make the most of it.\r\n\r\nWhen the framers finished crafting our Constitution, Benjamin Franklin\r\nstood in Independence Hall and reflected on a painting of the sun, low on\r\nthe horizon. He said, \"I have often wondered whether that sun was rising or\r\nsetting. Today,\" Franklin said, \"I have the happiness to know it is a\r\nrising sun.\" Well, today, because each generation of Americans has kept the\r\nfire of freedom burning brightly, lighting those frontiers of possibility,\r\nwe still bask in the warmth of Mr. Franklin's rising sun.\r\n\r\nAfter 224 years, the American Revolution continues. We remain a new nation.\r\nAs long as our dreams outweigh our memories, America will be forever young.\r\nThat is our destiny. And this is our moment.\r\n\r\nThank you, God bless you, and God bless America.",
