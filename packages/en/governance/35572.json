Political problems have served\r\nonly to introduce popular government. The economic problems now\r\nrushing upon us will bring the real test of democracy.\r\n\r\nThe workingman has taken an advanced place in the struggle for the\r\ndemocratization of industry. He has done so, first, through the\r\norganization of labor unions; secondly, through the development of\r\npolitical parties--labor parties. The blend of politics and economics\r\nwhich he affects is loosely called Socialism. The term is as\r\nindefinite in meaning as it is potent in influence. It has spread its\r\nunctuous doctrines over every industrial land, and its representatives\r\nsit in every important parliament, including our Congress.\r\n\r\nSuch a movement requires careful consideration from every point of\r\nview.\r\n\r\nIt is the object of this volume to trace briefly the growth of the\r\nmovement in four leading European countries, and to attempt to\r\ndetermine the relation of economic and political Socialism to\r\ndemocracy--a question of peculiar interest to the friends of the\r\nAmerican Republic at this time.\r\n\r\nIn preparing this volume, the author has made extended visits to the\r\ncountries studied. He has tried to catch the spirit of the movement by\r\npersonal contact with the Socialist leaders and their antagonists,\r\nand by many interviews with laboring men, the rank and file in every\r\ncountry visited.\r\n\r\nEverywhere he was received with the greatest cordiality, and he wishes\r\nhere to express his appreciation of these many kindnesses.\r\n\r\nHe wishes especially to acknowledge his obligations to the following\r\ngentlemen: Mr. Graham Wallas of the University of London; Mr. W.G.\r\nTowler of the London Municipal Society; Mr. John Hobson of London, and\r\nMr. J.S. Middleton, assistant secretary of the Labor Party; to Dr.\r\nRobert Herz and Prof. Charles Gide of the University of Paris; Dr.\r\nAlbert Thomas and M. Adolphe Landry of the Chamber of Deputies; M.\r\nJean Longuet, editor of _L'Humanite_; to Dr. Franz Oppenheimer of the\r\nUniversity of Berlin; Dr. Suedekum of the Reichstag; Dr. Hilferding,\r\neditor of _Vorwaerts_; Prof. T.H.

The French Socialist\r\nprogram begins with the assertion, \"Socialism is a question of class.\"\r\nClass distinction is the generator of Socialism.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary social triptych--upper, middle, and lower classes--will\r\nnot suffice us in our inquiry. We must distinguish between the\r\nfunctions of the classes. The upper class is a remnant of the feudal\r\ndays, of the manorial times, when land-holding brought with it social\r\ndistinction and political prerogative. In this sense we have no upper\r\nclass in America. The middle class is composed of the business and\r\nprofessional element, and the lower class of the wage-earning element.\r\n\r\nThere are two words, as yet quite unfamiliar to American readers,\r\nwhich are met with constantly in European works on Socialism and are\r\nheard on every hand in political discussions--_proletariat_ and\r\n_bourgeois_. The proletariat are the wage-earning class, the poor,\r\nthe underlings. The bourgeois[1] are roughly the middle class. The\r\nFrench divide them into _petits_ bourgeois and _grands_ bourgeois.\r\nWerner Sombart divides them into lower middle class, the manual\r\nlaborers who represent the guild system, and bourgeoisie, the\r\nrepresentatives of the capitalistic system.[2]\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that these divisions have a historical basis. The\r\nupper class reflect the days of feudalism, of governmental prerogative\r\nand aristocracy. The middle class are the representatives of the guild\r\nand mercantile systems, when hand labor and later business acumen\r\nbrought power and wealth to the craftsman and adventurer. The lower\r\nclass are the homologues of the slaves, the serfs, the toilers, whose\r\nreward has constantly been measured by the standard of bare existence.\r\nSocialism arises consciously out of the efforts of this class to win\r\nfor itself a share of the powers of the other classes. It is necessary\r\nto understand that while this class distinction is historic in origin\r\nit is essentially economic in fact. It is not \"social\"; a middle-class\r\nmillionaire may be congenial to the social circles of the high-born.\r\nIt is not political; a workingman may vote with any party he chooses.\r\nHe may ally himself with the conservative Center as he sometimes does\r\nin Germany, or with the Liberal Party as he sometimes does in England,\r\nor with either of the old parties as he does in the United States. On\r\nthe other hand, a bourgeois may be a Socialist and vote with the\r\nproletarians. Indeed, many of the Socialist leaders belong to the\r\nwell-to-do middle class.\r\n\r\nThis class distinction, then, is economic. It is a distinction of\r\nfunction, the function of the capitalist and the function of the\r\nwage-earner. Let us go one step further; it is a distinction in\r\nproperty. The possessor of private wealth can become a capitalist by\r\ninvesting his money in productive enterprise. He then becomes the\r\nemployer of labor. There are all grades of capitalists, from the\r\nmaster wagon-maker who works by the side of his one or two workmen, to\r\nthe \"captain\" of a vast industry that gives employment to thousands of\r\nmen and turns out a wagon a minute.\r\n\r\nThe institution of private property is the basis of Socialism because\r\nit is the basis of capitalistic production. It places in one man's\r\nhands the power of owning raw material, machinery, land, factory, and\r\nfinished product; and the power of hiring men to operate the\r\nmachinery, and to convert the raw material into marketable wares. As\r\nlong as this power was limited to hand industry the proletarian\r\nmovement was abortive. When the industrial revolution linked the\r\ningenuity of man to the power of nature it so multiplied the potency\r\nof the possessor that the proletarian movement by stress of\r\ncircumstances became a great factor in industrial life.\r\n\r\nWhile the possession either of wealth or family tradition was always\r\nthe basis of class distinction, the industrial revolution brought with\r\nit the enormously multiplied power of capital and the glorification of\r\nriches. The proletarians multiplied rapidly in number, and all the\r\nevils of sharp class distinction were heightened. In all lands where\r\ncapitalistic production spread, the two classes grew farther apart,\r\nthe distinction between possessor and wage-earner increased.\r\n\r\nIt is not the mere possession of wealth, however, which forms the\r\nanimus of the Socialist movement. It is probably not even the abuse of\r\nthis wealth, although this is a large factor in the problem. It is the\r\npsychological effect of the capitalist system that is the real\r\nenginery of Socialism. It is the class feeling, the consciousness of\r\nthe workingman that he is contributing muscle and blood and sweat to\r\nthe perfection of an article whose possession he does not share. This\r\nfeeling is aroused by the contrasts of life that the worker constantly\r\nsees around him. He feels that his own life energy has contributed to\r\nthe magnificent equipages and the palatial luxuries of his employer.\r\nHe compares his own lot and that of his family with the lot of the\r\ncapitalist. This feeling of envy is not blunted by the kaleidoscopic\r\nsuddenness with which changes of fortune can take place in America\r\nto-day. By some stroke of luck or piece of ingenious planning, a\r\nreceiver of wages to-day may be the giver of wages to-morrow.\r\n\r\nNor does the spread of education and intelligence dull the contrasts.\r\nIt greatly heightens them. The workman can now begin to analyze the\r\nconditions under which he lives. He ponders over the distinctions that\r\nare actual and contrasts them with his imagined utopia. To him the\r\ndifferences between employer and employee are not natural. He does not\r\nattribute them to any fault or shortcoming or inferiority of his own,\r\nnor of his master, but to a flaw in the organization of society. The\r\nsocial order is wrong.\r\n\r\nThe workingman has become the critic. Here you have the heart of\r\nSocialism. Whatever form its outward aspect may take, at heart it is a\r\nrebellion against things as they are. And whatever may be the\r\nsyllogisms of its logic, or the formularies of its philosophy, they\r\nall begin with a grievance, that things as they are are wrong; and\r\nthey all end in a hope for a better society of to-morrow where the\r\ninequalities shall somehow be made right.\r\n\r\nIn his struggle toward a new economic ideal, the proletarian has\r\nachieved a class homogeneity and self-consciousness. The individuality\r\nthat is denied him in industry he has sought and found among his own\r\nbrethren. In the great factory he loses even his name and becomes\r\nnumber so-and-so. In his union and in his party he asserts his\r\nindividuality with a grim and impressive stubbornness. The gravitation\r\nof common ideals and common protests draws these forgotten particles\r\nof industrialism into a massed consciousness that is to-day one of the\r\nworld's great potencies. The very fact that we call this body of\r\nworkers \"the masses\" is significant. We speak of them as a geologist\r\nspeaks of his \"basement complex.\" We recognize unconsciously that they\r\nform the foundation of our economic life.\r\n\r\nThe class struggle, then, is between two clearly defined and\r\nself-conscious elements in modern industrial life that are the natural\r\nproduct of our machine industry. On the one hand is the business man\r\npursuing with fevered energy the profits that are the goal of his\r\nactivity; on the other hand are the workingmen who, more and more\r\nsullen in their discontent, are clamoring louder each year for a\r\ngreater share of the wealth they believe their toil creates.\r\n\r\nThere is some reason to believe that this class basis of Socialism is\r\nvanishing. In England J. Ramsay MacDonald denies its significance.[3]\r\nRevisionists and progressive Socialists, who are throwing aside the\r\nMarxian dogmas, are also preaching the universality of the Socialist\r\nconception. However, the economic factor based on class functions\r\nremains the essence of the social movement.[4]\r\n\r\nWhat are the ideals of Socialism? They are not merely economic or\r\nsocial, they embrace all life. After one has taken the pains to read\r\nthe more important mass of Socialist literature, books, pamphlets, and\r\nsome current newspapers and magazines, and has listened to their\r\norators and talked with their leaders, confusion still remains in the\r\nmind. The movement is so all-embracing that it has no clearly defined\r\nlimits. The Socialists are feeling their way from protest into\r\npractice. Their heads are in the clouds; of this you are certain as\r\nyou proceed through their books and listen to their speeches. But are\r\ntheir feet upon the earth?\r\n\r\nFor a literature of protest against \"suffering, misery, and\r\ninjustice,\" as Owen calls it, there is a wonderful buoyancy and hope\r\nin their words. It is one of the secrets of its power that Socialism\r\nis not the energy of despair. It is the demand for the right to live\r\nfully, joyfully, and in comfort. The Socialists demand ozone in their\r\nair, nutrition in their food, heartiness in their laughter, ease in\r\ntheir homes, and their days must have hours of relaxation.\r\n\r\nThe awakening aspirations of the proletarian were expressed by one of\r\ntheir own number, William Weitling, a tailor of Magdeburg. He\r\nafterwards migrated to America and became one of our first Socialist\r\nagitators. His book is called _Garantieen der Harmonie und Freiheit_\r\n(Guaranties of Harmony and Liberty). The book is illogical, full of\r\ncontradictions, and all of the errors of a child's reasoning. But it\r\nremains the workingman's classic philippic, one of the most trenchant\r\nrecitals of social wrongs, because it blends, with the illogical\r\nterminology of sentimentalism, the assurance of hope. \"Property,\" he\r\nsays, \"is the root of all evil.\" Gold is the symbol of this world of\r\nwrongs. \"We have become as accustomed to our coppers as the devil to\r\nhis hell.\" When the rule of gold shall cease, then \"the teardrops\r\nwhich are the tokens of true brotherliness will return to the dry eyes\r\nof the selfish, the soul of the evildoer will be filled with noble and\r\nvirtuous sentiments such as he had never known before, and the impious\r\nones who have hitherto denied God will sing His praise.\" The humble\r\ntailor is assured that the reign of property will be terminated and\r\nthe age of humanity begin, and he calls to the workingman, \"Forward,\r\nbrethren; with the curse of Mammon on our lips, let us await the hour\r\nof our emancipation, when our tears will be transmuted into pearls of\r\ndew, our earth transformed into a paradise, and all of mankind united\r\ninto one happy family.\"[5] Nor is the closing cry of his book without\r\nan element of prophecy. He addresses the \"mighty ones of this earth,\"\r\nadmonishing them that they may secure the fame of Alexander and\r\nNapoleon by the deeds of emancipation which lie in their power. \"But\r\nif you compel us (the proletarians) to undertake the task alone with\r\nour raw material, then it will be accomplished only after weary toil\r\nand pain to us and to you.\"\r\n\r\nLet us turn to Robert Owen, who was at an early age the most\r\nsuccessful cotton spinner in England. He adapted an old philosophy to\r\na new humanitarianism. He saw that a \"gradual increase in the number\r\nof our paupers has accompanied our increasing wealth.\"[6] He began the\r\nseries of experiments which made his name familiar in England and\r\nAmerica and made him known in history as the greatest experimental\r\ncommunist. His experiments have failed. But his hopefulness persists.\r\nIn his address delivered at the dedication of New Lanark, 1816, he\r\nsaid that he had found plenty of unhappiness and plenty of misery.\r\n\"But from this day a change must take place; a new era must commence;\r\nthe human intellect, through the whole extent of the earth, hitherto\r\nenveloped by the grossest ignorance and superstition, must begin to be\r\nreleased from its state of darkness; nor shall nourishment henceforth\r\nbe given to the seeds of disunion and division among men. For the time\r\nhas come when the means may be prepared to train all the nations of\r\nthe world in that knowledge which shall _impel them not only to love\r\nbut to be actively kind to each other in the whole of their conduct,\r\nwithout a single exception_.\"\r\n\r\nHere is an all-inclusive hopefulness. Its significance is not\r\ndiminished by the fact that it was spoken of his own peculiar remedy\r\nby education and environment.\r\n\r\nThis faith and hope runs through all their books like a golden song.\r\nExcepting Marx, he was the great gloomy one. Even those who condemn\r\nmodern society with the most scathing adjectives link with their\r\ndenunciations the most sanguine sentences of hope.\r\n\r\nThe Christian Socialism of Kingsley is filled with optimism. \"Look up,\r\nmy brother Christians, open your eyes, the hour of a new crusade has\r\nstruck.\"[7]\r\n\r\nThe song of the new crusade was sung by Robert Morris:\r\n\r\n    \"Come, shoulder to shoulder ere the world grows older!\r\n      Help lies in naught but thee and me;\r\n    Hope is before us, the long years that bore us,\r\n      Bore leaders more than men may be.\r\n\r\n    \"Let dead hearts tarry and trade and marry,\r\n      And trembling nurse their dreams of mirth,\r\n    While we, the living, our lives are giving\r\n      To bring the bright new world to birth.\"\r\n\r\nThis song of hope is sung to-day by thousands of marching Socialists.\r\nTheir bitter experiences in parliaments and in strikes, and all the\r\nwarfare of politics and trade, have not blighted their rosy hope. They\r\nare still looking forward to \"the bright new world,\" in which a new\r\nsocial order shall reign.\r\n\r\nLinked with this optimism is a certain prophetic tone, an elevation of\r\nspirit that lifts some of their books out of the commonplace. The\r\nsincerity of these prophets of Socialism contributes this quality more\r\nthan does their originality of mind.\r\n\r\nIn their search for happiness the Socialists see a great barrier in\r\ntheir way. The barrier is want, poverty. There are no greater\r\ncontrasts, mental and temperamental, than between John Stuart Mill,\r\nthe erudite economist and philosopher, and H.G. Wells, the romancer\r\nand sentimental critic of things as they are. Both begin their attacks\r\nupon the social order at the same point--the vulnerable spot,\r\n_poverty_. Mill places it first in his category of existing evils. He\r\nasks, \"What proportion of the population in the most civilized\r\ncountries of Europe enjoy, in their own person, anything worth naming\r\nof the benefits of property?\" \"Suffice it to say that the condition of\r\nnumbers in civilized Europe, and even in England and France, is more\r\nwretched than that of most tribes of savages who are known to us.\"[8]\r\n\r\nWells bases his racy criticism in his popular book, _New Worlds for\r\nOld_, on the facts revealed in the reports of various charity\r\norganizations in Edinburgh, York, and London. To both the exacting\r\neconomist and the popular expositor of Socialism, poverty is the\r\nglaring fault of our social system. To Wells poverty is an \"atrocious\r\nfailure in statesmanship.\"[9] To Mill it is \"_pro tanto_ a failure of\r\nthe social arrangement.\"[10]\r\n\r\nThese examples are typical. Every school of Socialism finds in poverty\r\nthe curse, in private property the cause, of human misery, and in a\r\nreadjusted machinery of social production the hope of human\r\nbetterment.\r\n\r\nAll Socialists, learned and unlearned, agree that poverty is the\r\nstumbling-block in the pathway to better social conditions. They all\r\nagree as to the causes of poverty: first, private capitalistic\r\nproduction; second, competition. It is private capitalistic production\r\nthat enables the employer to pocket all the profits; it is competition\r\nthat enables him to buy labor in an open market at the lowest possible\r\nprice, a price regulated by the necessities of bare existence. To the\r\nSocialist, competition is anarchy, an anarchy that leaves \"every man\r\nfree to ruin himself so that he may ruin another.\"[11]\r\n\r\nTo do away with private capital and to abolish competition means\r\nbringing about a tremendous change in society. All Socialists\r\nunhesitatingly and with boldness are ready, even eager, to make such a\r\nchange. The problem is not insuperable to them.\r\n\r\nThe three theories that underlie Socialism permit the hope of the\r\npossibility of a social regeneration. These theories are, first, that\r\nGod made the world good, hence all you need to do is to revert to this\r\npristine goodness and the world is reformed. Second, that society is\r\nwhat it is through evolution. If this is true then it is only\r\nnecessary to control by environment the factors of evolution and the\r\nproduct will be preordained. Third, that even if man is bad and has\r\npermitted pernicious institutions like private property to exist, he\r\ncan remake society by a bold effort, i.e., by revolution, because all\r\nsocial power is vested in man and he can do as he likes. The ruling\r\nclass can impose its social order upon all. When the Socialist becomes\r\nthe ruling class his social system will be adopted.\r\n\r\nThis great change which the Socialist has in mind means the\r\nsubstitution of co-operation for competition and the placing of\r\nproductive property in the care of the state or of society, instead\r\nof letting it remain under the domination of individuals. To abolish\r\nprivate productive capital by making it public, to establish a\r\ncommunistic instead of a competitive society, that is the object.\r\n\r\nIn the Socialist's new order of society, where poverty will be\r\nunknown, there is to be a common bond. This bond is not possession,\r\nbut work. With glowing exultation all the expositors and exhorters of\r\nthe proletarian movement dwell upon the blessedness of toil. They\r\nglorify man, not through his inheritance of personality, certainly not\r\nthrough his possession of things, but through his achievements of\r\ntoil.\r\n\r\nWhen all members of society work at useful occupations, then all the\r\nnecessary things can be done in a few hours. Six or four, or some even\r\nsay two, hours a day will be sufficient to do all the drudgery and the\r\nessential things in a well-organized human beehive. There is to be\r\nnothing morose or despondent in this toil. It is all to be done to the\r\nmelody of good cheer and willingness.\r\n\r\nHow is this great change to come about, and what is to be the exact\r\norganization of society under this regime of work and co-operation?\r\nHere unanimity ceases. As a criticism Socialism is unanimous, as a\r\nmethod it is divided, as a reconstructive process it is hopelessly at\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nAt first Socialists were utopians, then they became revolutionists.\r\nThis was natural. Socialism was born in an air of revolution--the\r\npolitical revolutions of the bourgeois, and the infinitely greater\r\nindustrial revolution. The tides of change and passion were rocking\r\nthe foundations of state and industry. The evils in early\r\nindustrialism were abhorrent. Small children and their mothers were\r\nforced into factories, pauperism was thriving, the ugly machine-fed\r\ntowns were replacing the quaint and cheerful villages, rulers were\r\nforgetting their duties in their greed for gain, and the state was\r\npersecuting men for their political and economic opinions. Every face\r\nwas turned against the preachers of the new order, and they naturally\r\nthought that the change could be brought about only by violence and\r\nrevolution. Louis Blanc said \"a social revolution ought to be tried:\r\n\r\n\"Firstly, because the present social system is too full of iniquity,\r\nmisery, and turpitude to exist much longer.\r\n\r\n\"Secondly, because there is no one who is not interested, whatever his\r\nposition, rank, and fortune, in the inauguration of a new social\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n\"Thirdly, and lastly, because this revolution, so necessary, is\r\npossible, even easy to accomplish peacefully.\"[12]\r\n\r\nThese are the naive words of a young man of thirty-seven, the youngest\r\nmember of the ill-fated revolutionary government of France in 1848.\r\nNot every one thought that the revolution could be peacefully\r\naccomplished, and, it must be admitted, few seemed to care.\r\n\r\nIn their \"Communist Manifesto,\" the most noted of all Socialist\r\nbroadsides, Marx and Engels know of no peaceful revolution. They close\r\nwith these virile words: \"The communists disdain to conceal their\r\nviews and aims. They openly declare that their ends can be attained\r\nonly by the forcible overthrow of all existing conditions. Let the\r\nruling classes tremble at a communistic revolution. The proletarians\r\nhave nothing to lose but their chains. They have the world to win.\r\nWorkingmen of all countries, unite!\"\r\n\r\nThese words are often quoted even in these placid days of evolution\r\nthat have replaced the red days of violence. The workingmen of all\r\ncountries are uniting, as we shall see, not for bloody revolution nor\r\nfor the violence of passion, but for the promulgation of peace. To-day\r\nthe silent coercion of multitudes is taking the place of the eruptive\r\nmethods of the '40's and the '70's.\r\n\r\nAs to the ultimate form of organized society, there is nothing but\r\nconfusion to be found in the mass of literature that has grown up\r\naround the subject. The earliest writers were cocksure of themselves;\r\nthe latest ones bridge over the question with wide-arching\r\ngeneralities. I have asked many of their leaders to give me some hint\r\nas to what form their Society of To-morrow will take. Every one\r\ndodged. \"No one can tell. It will be humanitarian and co-operative.\"\r\n\r\nIf one could be assured of this!\r\n\r\nFinally, all Socialists agree in the instrument of change. It lies at\r\nhand as the greatest co-operative achievement of our race, the state.\r\nIt is the common possession of all, and it is the one power that can\r\nlay its hands upon property and compel its obedience. The power of the\r\nstate is to be the dynamo of change. This state is naturally to be\r\ndemocratic. The people shall hold the reins of power in their own\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that every year sees a shifting in the\r\nSocialist's attitude. As he has left the sphere of mere fault-finding\r\nand of dreaming, and has entered politics, entered the labor war\r\nthrough unions, and the business war through co-operative societies,\r\nhe has been compelled to adapt himself to the necessities of things as\r\nthey are.\r\n\r\nI have tried briefly to show that Socialism originated as a class\r\nmovement, a proletarian movement; that the classes, wage-earner and\r\ncapitalist, are the natural outcome of machine production; that\r\nSocialism is one of the natural products of the antagonistic relations\r\nthat these two classes at present occupy; that Socialism intends to\r\neliminate this antagonism by eliminating the private employer. I have\r\ntried to show also that Socialism is a criticism of the present social\r\norder placing the blame for the miseries of society upon the shoulders\r\nof private property and competition; that it is optimistic in spirit,\r\nbuoyant in hope; and that its program of reconstruction is confused\r\nand immature.\r\n\r\nStripped of its glamour, our society is in a neck-to-neck race for\r\nthings, for property. Its hideousness has shocked the sensibilities of\r\ndreamers and humanitarians. Our machine industry has produced a\r\ncivilization that is ugly. It is natural that the esthetic and\r\nphilanthropic members of this society should raise their protest.\r\nRuskin and Anatole France and Maeterlinck and Carlyle and Robert\r\nMorris and Emerson and Grierson are read with increasing satisfaction.\r\nIt is natural that the participants in this death race should utter\r\ntheir cries of alternate despair and hope. Socialism is the cry of the\r\ntoiler. It is not to be ignored. We in America have no conception of\r\nits potency. There are millions of hearts in Europe hanging upon its\r\nprecepts for the hope that makes life worth the fight.\r\n\r\nTheir Utopia may be only a rainbow, a mirage in the mists on the\r\nhorizon. But the energy which it has inspired is a reality. It has\r\norganized the largest body of human beings that the world has known.\r\nIts international Socialist movement has but one rival for homogeneity\r\nand zeal, the Church, whose organization at one time embraced all\r\nkingdoms and enlisted the faithful service of princes and paupers.\r\n\r\nIt is this reality in its political form which I hope to set forth in\r\nthe following pages. We will try to discover what the Socialist\r\nmovement is doing in politics, how much of theory has been merged in\r\npolitical practice, what its everyday parliamentary drudgery is, and,\r\nif possible, to tell in what direction the movement is tending.\r\n\r\nBefore we do this it is necessary to state briefly the history of the\r\nunderlying theories of the movement.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] \"By bourgeoisie is meant the class of modern capitalists, owners\r\nof the means of social production, and employers of wage-labor.

It began\r\nwhile the Revolution was still filling men's minds with a turbulent\r\noptimism that knew no limit to human \"progress.\"\r\n\r\nSaint-Simon (Count Henri de) may be considered the founder of French\r\nSocialism. He was of noble lineage, born in 1760, and died in 1825. He\r\ntook very little part in the French Revolution, but was a soldier in\r\nour Continental army, and always manifested a keen interest in\r\nAmerican affairs. Possessed of an inquiring mind, an ambitious spirit,\r\nand a heart full of sympathy for the oppressed, he devoted himself to\r\nthe study of society for the purpose of elaborating a scheme for\r\nuniversal human betterment.\r\n\r\nBefore he began his special studies he amassed a modest fortune in\r\nland speculation. Not that he loved money, he assures us, but because\r\nhe wished independence and leisure to do his chosen work. This money\r\nwas soon lost, through unfortunate experiments and an unfortunate\r\nmarriage, and the most of his days were spent in penury.\r\n\r\nHe attracted to himself a number of the most brilliant young men in\r\nFrance, among them De Lesseps who subsequently carried out one of the\r\nplans of his master, the Suez Canal; and Auguste Comte, who embodied\r\nin his positivism the philosophical teachings of Saint-Simon.\r\n\r\nSaint-Simon believed that society needed to be entirely reorganized on\r\na \"scientific basis,\" and that \"the whole of society ought to labor\r\nfor the amelioration of the moral and physical condition of the\r\npoorest class. Society ought to organize itself in the manner the most\r\nsuitable for the attainment of this great end.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThe two counteracting motives or spirits in society are the spirit of\r\nantagonism and the spirit of association. Hitherto the spirit of\r\nantagonism has prevailed, and misery has resulted. Let the spirit of\r\nassociation rule, and the evils will vanish.\r\n\r\nUnder the rule of antagonism, property has become the possession of\r\nthe few, poverty and misery the lot of the many. Both property and\r\npoverty are inherited, therefore the state should abolish all laws of\r\ninheritance, take all property under its dominion, and let society be\r\nthe sole proprietor of the instruments of labor and of the fund that\r\nlabor creates.\r\n\r\nThrough the teachings of Saint-Simon runs a constant stream of\r\nreligious fervor. In Christianity he found the moral doctrine that\r\ngave sanction to his social views. He sought the primitive\r\nChristianity, stripped of the dogmas and opinions of the centuries. In\r\nhis principal work, _Nouveau Christianisme_ (New Christianity), he\r\nsubjects the teachings of Catholicism and Protestantism to ingenious\r\ncriticism, and finds in the teachings of Christ the essential moral\r\nelements necessary for a society based on the spirit of association.\r\n\r\nSaint-Simon was a humanitarian rather than a systematic thinker. His\r\nanalysis of society is ingenious rather than constructive. His\r\nteachings were elaborated by his followers, who organized themselves\r\ninto a school called the \"Sacred College of the Apostles,\" with Bazard\r\nand Enfantin as their leaders. They were accused, in the Chamber of\r\nDeputies, of promulgating communism of property and wives. Their\r\ndefense, dated October, 1830, and issued as a booklet, is the best\r\nexposition of their views. They said that: \"We demand that land,\r\ncapital, and all the instruments of labor shall become common\r\nproperty, and be so managed that each one's portion shall correspond\r\nto his capacity, and his reward to his labors.\" \"Like the early\r\nChristians, we demand that one man should be united to one woman, but\r\nwe teach that the wife should be the equal of the husband.\"\r\n\r\nOn the question of marriage, however, the sect split soon after this\r\ndefense was written. Enfantin became a defender of free love, and\r\ninaugurated a fantastic sacerdotalism which drove Bazard from the\r\n\"Sacred College.\"[2]\r\n\r\nThe second French social philosopher of the Utopian school was\r\nFrancois Marie Charles Fourier (1772-1837). He was a bourgeois, son of\r\na draper, and brought as keen an intellect as did his noble\r\nfellow-countryman, Saint-Simon, to the analysis of society, and a much\r\nmore practical experience. In his youth he had been employed in\r\nvarious business enterprises. He recalls, in his works, several\r\nexperiences which he never forgot. As a lad, he was reproached for\r\ntelling a prospective customer the truth about some goods in his\r\nfather's shop. When a young man of twenty-seven he was sent to\r\nMarseilles to superintend the destruction of great cargoes of rice\r\nthat had been held for higher prices, during a period of scarcity of\r\nfood when thousands of people were suffering from hunger. The rice had\r\nspoiled in the waiting. The event made so profound an impression upon\r\nhis mind that he resolved to devote his life to the betterment of an\r\neconomic system that allowed such wanton waste.\r\n\r\nTo his mind the problem of rebuilding society was practical, not\r\nmetaphysical. But underlying his practical solution was a fantastic\r\ncosmogony and psychology. He reduced everything to a mathematical\r\nsystem, and even computed the number of years the world would spin on\r\nits axis. He believed that God created a good world, and that man has\r\ndesecrated it; that the function of the social reformer is to\r\nunderstand the design of the Creator, and call mankind back to this\r\noriginal plan, back to the original impulses and passions, and\r\nprimitive goodness.\r\n\r\nThis could be done only under ideal environment. Such an environment\r\nhe proposed to create in huge caravansaries, which he called\r\nphalansteries. Each group, or phalange, was composed of 400 families,\r\nor 1,800 persons, living on a large square of land, where they could\r\nbe self-contained and self-sufficient, like the manors in the feudal\r\ndays. The phalanstery was built in the middle of the tract, and was\r\nmerely a glorified apartment house. Every one chose to do the work he\r\nliked best. Agriculture and manufacture were to be happily blended,\r\nand individual freedom given full sway. Each phalange was designed to\r\nbe an ideal democracy, electing its officers and governing itself. The\r\nprinciple of freedom was to extend even to marriage and the relation\r\nof the sexes.\r\n\r\nIt was Fourier's belief that one such phalange once established would\r\nso impress the world with its superiority that society would be glad\r\nto imitate it. Ere long there would be groups of phalanges\r\nco-operating with each other, and ultimately the whole world would be\r\nbrought into one vast federation of phalanges, with their chief center\r\nat Constantinople.\r\n\r\nThe general plan of this apartment-house utopia lent itself to all\r\nsorts of fantastic details. It gained adherents among the learned, the\r\neager, and even the rich, and a number of experiments were tried. All\r\nof these have failed, I think, excepting only the community at Guise,\r\nfounded by Jean Godin. Here, however, the fantasies have been\r\neliminated, and the strong controlling force of the founder has made\r\nit prosperous. There is no agriculture connected with the Guise\r\nestablishment.\r\n\r\nA number of Fourier colonies, most of them modifications of his\r\nphalanstery idea, were started in the United States. Of thirty-four\r\nsuch experiments tried in America all have failed. The most famous of\r\nthese attempts was Brook Farm.[3]\r\n\r\nRobert Owen (1771-1858) was the great English utopian. He was the son\r\nof a small trader. Such was his business ability and tenacity of\r\ncharacter that at nineteen years of age he was superintendent of a\r\ncotton mill that employed 500 hands. His business acumen soon made him\r\nrich, his philanthropic impulses led him to study the conditions of\r\nthe people who worked for him. In 1800 he took charge of the mills at\r\nNew Lanark. There he had under him as pitiful and miserable a group of\r\nworkmen as can be imagined. The factory system made wretchedness the\r\ncommon lot of the English workingman of this period. The hours of\r\nlabor were intolerably long, the homes of the working people\r\nunutterably squalid, women and tiny children worked all day under the\r\nmost unwholesome conditions; vice, drunkenness, and ignorance were\r\neverywhere.\r\n\r\nOwen began as a practical philanthropist. He improved the sanitary\r\nconditions of his mills and town, was the first employer to reasonably\r\nshorten the hours of work, founded primary schools, proposed factory\r\nlegislation, and founded the co-operative movement that has grown to\r\ngreat strength in England. He was one of the powerful men of the\r\nisland at this period. He had the enthusiastic support of the queen,\r\nof many nobles, of clergy and scholars. But in a great public meeting\r\nin London he went out of his way to denounce the accepted forms of\r\nreligion and declare his independence of all creeds, an offense that\r\nthe English people never forgive.\r\n\r\nBy this time he had perfected his scheme for social reform. He\r\nproposed to establish communities of 1,000 to 1,200 persons on about\r\n1,500 acres of land. They were to live in an enormous building in the\r\nform of a square, each family to have its own apartments, but kitchen\r\nand dining-room to be in common. Every advantage of work, education,\r\nand leisure was planned for the inmates.\r\n\r\nA number of Owenite communities were founded in England and America.\r\nThe one at New Harmony, Ind., was the most pretentious, and in it Owen\r\nsank a large portion of his fortune. None of the experiments survived\r\ntheir founder.[4]\r\n\r\nThe Utopians were all optimists--the source of their optimism was the\r\nsocial philosophy that prevailed from the French Revolution to the\r\nmiddle of the last century. It was the philosophy of an unbounded\r\nfaith in the goodness of human nature. A good God made a good world,\r\nand made man capable of attaining goodness and harmony in all his\r\nrelations. The evil in the world was contrary to God's plan. It was\r\nintroduced by the perversity of society. The source of misery is the\r\nlack of knowledge. If humankind knew the right way of living, knew the\r\noriginal plan of the Creator, then there would be no misery. You must\r\nfind this knowledge, this science, and upon it build society. Hence\r\nthey are all seeking a \"scientific state of society,\" and call their\r\nsystem \"scientific.\" From Rousseau to Hegel, the theory prevailed that\r\nevil is collective, good is individual; society is bad, man is pure.\r\n\r\nCabet expresses it clearly. \"God is perfection, infinite,\r\nall-powerful, is justice and goodness. God is our father, and it\r\nfollows that all men are brethren and all are equal, as in one\r\nall-embracing family.\" \"It is evident that, to the fathers of the\r\nChurch, Christianity was communism. Communism is nothing other than\r\ntrue Christianity....\" \"The regnancy of God, through Jesus, is the\r\nregnancy of perfection, of omniscience, of justice, of goodness, of\r\npaternal love; and, it follows, of fraternity, equality, and liberty;\r\nof the unity of community interests, that is of communism (of the\r\ngeneral common welfare), in place of the individual.\"[5]\r\n\r\nThis edenesque logic was dear to Fourier, who left more profound\r\ntraces on modern thought than the fantastic Saint-Simonians.[6]\r\n\r\nFourier began with God. \"On beholding this mechanism (the world and\r\nhuman society), or even in making an estimate of its properties, it\r\nwill be comprehended that God has done well all that He has done.\"[7]\r\nMan has only to find \"God's design\" in order to find the true basis of\r\nsociety; and man's system of industrially parceling out the good\r\nthings of life among a few favored ones, is the \"antipodes of God's\r\ndesign.\" The finding of this design is the function of \"exact\r\nscience\"; man, who has stifled the voice of nature, must now\r\n\"vindicate the Creator.\"[8]\r\n\r\nSaint-Simon's whole system rests on this principle: \"God has said that\r\nmen ought to act toward each other as brethren.\" This principle will\r\nregulate society, for \"in accordance with this principle, which God\r\nhas given to men for the rule of their conduct, they ought to organize\r\nsociety in the manner the most advantageous to the greatest\r\nnumber.\"[9]\r\n\r\nThe social philosophers at the end of the eighteenth century did not\r\nbelieve that this rightness should be brought about by violence. \"What\r\nI should desire,\" says Godwin, \"is not by violence to change its\r\ninstitutions, but by discussion to change its ideas. I have no\r\nconcern, if I would study merely the public good, with factions or\r\nintrigue; but simply to promulgate the truth, and to wait the tranquil\r\nprogress of conviction. Let us anxiously refrain from violence.\"[10]\r\n\r\nOwen, who lived a few decades later, came into contact with the\r\ntheories of the succeeding school of thought. His utopianism remained,\r\nhowever, upon the older basis. He taught that the evils of society\r\nwere not inherent in the nature of mankind. The natural state of the\r\nworld and of man was good. But the evils \"are all the necessary\r\nconsequences of ignorance.\" Therefore, by education and environment he\r\ncould \"accomplish with ease and certainty the Herculean labor of\r\nforming a rational character in man, and that, too, chiefly before the\r\nchild commences the ordinary course of education.\"[11]\r\n\r\nThe Utopians are hopefully seeking the universal law which will\r\nre-form society. This was a natural view of things fundamental, to be\r\ntaken by men who had witnessed the political emancipation of the Third\r\nEstate and had seen \"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity\" carved over every\r\npublic portal in France, and the abstract principles of justice\r\ndebated in parliaments. A feeling of naive simplicity runs through all\r\ntheir writings. Just as civil liberty, they believed, had come by the\r\napplication of an abstract principle of natural law, so social and\r\neconomic freedom would come by the application of one universal\r\nabstract principle of human conduct. From this simplicity came a\r\nviolent reaction, which reached its climax in the anarchy of\r\nProudhon.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe Utopian period of Socialism may be said to end, and the\r\nrevolutionary era to begin, with the year 1830. The French Revolution\r\nwas a bourgeois uprising. But behind it was the grim and resolute\r\nbackground of the proletarian mass. When the Third Estate achieved its\r\nvictory, it proceeded to monopolize the governmental powers to the\r\nexclusion of its lowly allies. From 1830 to 1850 the ferment of\r\ndemocratic discontent spread over Europe and forced the demands of the\r\nworkingman into the foreground. The first outbreak occurred in France,\r\nin 1831, when the workingmen of Lyons, during a period of distressing\r\nfinancial depression, marched under the banner, \"Live working, or die\r\nfighting,\" demanding bread for their families and work for themselves.\r\nThis second chapter of the development of Socialism begins with a red\r\nletter.\r\n\r\nLouis Blanc (1813-82), the first philosopher of the new movement,\r\nstruck out boldly for a democratic organization of the government.\r\nThis differentiates him from Fourier and Saint-Simon, and links him\r\nwith the leading Socialist writers of our day. He published his\r\n_Organisation du Travail_ (Organization of Labor) in 1839. It\r\nimmediately gave him an immense popularity with the working classes.\r\nIt is a brilliant book, as fascinating in its phrases as it is\r\nforceful in its denunciation of existing society.\r\n\r\nHe said that it is vain to talk of improving mankind morally without\r\nimproving them materially. This improvement would not come from\r\nabove, from the higher classes. It would come from below, from the\r\nworking people themselves. Therefore, a prerequisite of social reform\r\nwas democracy. The proletarian must possess the power of the state in\r\norder to emancipate himself from the economic bondage that holds him\r\nin its grasp.\r\n\r\nThis democratic state should then establish national workshops, or\r\nassociations, which he called \"social workshops,\" the capital to be\r\nprovided by the state and the state to supervise their operation. He\r\nbelieved that, once established, they would soon become\r\nself-supporting and self-governing. The men would choose their own\r\nmanagers, dispose of their own profits, and take care that this\r\nbeneficent system would spread to all communities.\r\n\r\nHe was careful to explain that \"genius should assert its legitimate\r\nempire\"--there must be a hierarchy of ability.\r\n\r\nLouis Blanc believed in revolution as the method of social\r\nadvancement. He was himself a leader in the abortive revolution of\r\n1848, the revolt of the people against a weak and careless monarch. As\r\na member of the provisional government, he may be called the first\r\nSocialist to hold cabinet honors. And, like his successors in modern\r\ncabinets, he accomplished very little towards the bringing in of a new\r\nsocial order. It is true that national workshops were built by the\r\nFrench government at his suggestion; but not according to his plans.\r\nHis enemies saw to it that they served to bring discredit rather than\r\nhonor to the system which he had so carefully elaborated.[12]\r\n\r\nLouis Blanc did not entirely free himself of the earlier utopian\r\nconception that man was created good and innocent. He blames society\r\nfor allowing the individual to do evil. But he does take a step toward\r\nthe Marxian materialistic conception when he affirms that man was\r\ncreated with certain endowments of strength and intellect and that\r\nthese endowments should be spent in the welfare of society. The empire\r\nof service, not the \"empire of tribute,\" should be the measure of\r\nman's greatness.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of revolt was carried to its logical extreme by Proudhon\r\n(1809-65). He was the son of a cooper and a peasant maid, and he never\r\nforgot that he sprang from the proletariat. He was a precocious lad,\r\nwas a theologian, philologist, and linguist before he undertook the\r\nstudy of political economy. In 1840 he brought out his notable work,\r\n_Qu'est-ce que la Propriete?_ (What Is Property?), a novel question\r\nfor that day, to which he gave an amazing answer, \"Property is theft,\"\r\nergo \"property holders are thieves.\"\r\n\r\nProudhon was a man with the brain of a savant and the adjectives of a\r\npeasant. His startling phrases, however, are merely spotlights thrown\r\non a theory of society which he permeated with a genuine good will. He\r\nwas puritanic in moral principle, loyal to his friends, and a despiser\r\nof cant and formalism. But his love for paradoxes carried him beyond\r\nthe confines of logic.\r\n\r\nProperty is theft, he says, because it reaps without sowing and\r\nconsumes without producing. What right has a capitalist to charge me\r\neight per cent.? None. This eight per cent. does not represent\r\nanything of time or labor value put into the article I am buying. It\r\nis therefore robbery. Private property, the stronghold of the\r\nindividualist, is then to be abolished and a universal communism\r\nestablished? By no means. Communism is as unnatural as property.\r\nProudhon had only contempt for the phalanstery and national workshop\r\nof his predecessors. They were impossible, artificial, reduced life to\r\na monotonous dead level, and encouraged immorality. Property is wrong\r\nbecause it is the exploitation of the weak by the strong; communism is\r\nequally wrong because it is the exploitation of the strong by the\r\nweak. To this ingenious juggler of paradoxes this was by no means a\r\ndilemma. He resorted to a formula that was later amplified into the\r\nmost potent argument of Socialism by Marx. Service pays service, one\r\nday's work balances another day's work, time-labor is the just measure\r\nof value. Hour for hour, day for day, this should be the universal\r\nmedium of exchange.\r\n\r\nProudhon was really directing his attacks against rent and profit\r\nrather than against property. He proposed, as a measure of reform, a\r\nnational bank where every one could bring the product of his toil and\r\nreceive a paper in exchange denoting the time value of his article.\r\nThese slips of paper were to be the medium of exchange capable of\r\npurchasing equal time values. This glorified savage barter he even\r\nproposed to the Constituent Assembly, of which he was a member, and\r\nwhen it was rejected--only two votes were recorded for it--he tried to\r\nestablish it upon private foundations. He failed to raise the\r\nnecessary capital and his plan failed.\r\n\r\nProudhon is the father of modern Anarchy. His exaltation of\r\nindividualism led him to the suppression of government. Government, he\r\ntaught, is merely the dominance of one man over another, a form of\r\nintolerable oppression. \"The highest perfection of society is found in\r\nthe union of order and anarchy.\"\r\n\r\nFor his bitter tirades against property he received the scorn of the\r\nbourgeois, for his attacks upon the government he served three years\r\nin prison, and some years later he escaped a second term for a similar\r\ncause by fleeing to Brussels.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate outcome of his individualism was equality, which he\r\nachieved in economics by his theory of time-labor and in politics by\r\nhis theory of anarchy.\r\n\r\nOne cannot escape the conviction that the outcome of all his brilliant\r\nrhetorical legerdemain is man in a cage. Not man originally pure and\r\ngood as the utopians would have him, but man wilful, egoistic, capable\r\nof enslaving his fellows, a very different being from the man of mercy\r\nand love crushed by the collective injustice of society. Proudhon\r\nfrees this man from his oppressor and his oppressiveness by creating a\r\ncondition of equality through the destruction of property and of\r\ngovernment. But in destroying property he retains possessions, and in\r\nestablishing anarchy he maintains order. \"Free association,\r\nliberty--whose sole function is to maintain equality--in the means of\r\nproduction, and equivalence in exchanges, is the only possible, the\r\nonly just, the only true form of society.\"\r\n\r\n\"The government of man by man (under whatever name it be disguised) is\r\noppression. Society finds its highest perfection in the union of order\r\nand anarchy.\"[13]\r\n\r\nProudhon has had a large influence on modern Socialism. His trenchant\r\ninvectives against property and society are widely copied. From his\r\nutterances on government the Syndicalists of France, Italy, and Spain\r\nhave drawn their doctrine. The general strike is the child of his\r\nparadoxes. He wrote as the motto for his most influential book, _What\r\nIs Property?_, \"Destruam et aedificabo\" (I will destroy and I will\r\nbuild again). But, while he pointed the way to destruction, he failed\r\nto reveal a new and better order.\r\n\r\nThe way to modern Socialism was paved in Germany. The teaching of\r\nHegel cleared the way for the political unrest that spread over Europe\r\nin the '40's. Hegel was the proclaimer of the social revolution. He\r\ngave sanction to the tenets of destruction. Everything that exists is\r\nworth destroying, may be taken as the primary postulate at which the\r\nYoung Hegelians arrived. Truth does not exist merely in a collection\r\nof institutions or dogmatic axioms that could be memorized like the\r\nalphabet; truth is in the process of being, of knowing, it has\r\ndeveloped through the toilsome evolution of the race, it is found only\r\nin experience. Nothing is sacred merely because it exists. Existing\r\ninstitutions are only the prelude to other and better institutions\r\nthat are to follow. This was roughly the formula that the radical\r\nHegelians blocked out for themselves when they split from the orthodox\r\nconservatives in the '30's.\r\n\r\nIn 1843 appeared Feuerbach's _Wesen des Christentums_ (Essence of\r\nChristianity), putting the seal of materialism upon the precepts of\r\nthe Young Hegelians.[14] The God of the utopians was destroyed.\r\nThings were not created in harmony and beauty and disordered by man.\r\nThings as they are, are the result of evolution, of growth; nothing\r\nwas created as it is, and even \"Religion is the dream of the human\r\nmind.\"[15]\r\n\r\nOut of this atmosphere of philosophical, religious, and political\r\nrebellion sprang the prophet of modern Socialism, Karl Marx,[16] a man\r\nwhose intellectual endowments place him in the first ranks among\r\nSocialists and link his name with other bold intellects of his age who\r\nhave forced the current of human thought. There have been many books\r\nwritten on Marx, and every phase of his theories has been subjected to\r\nacademic and popular scrutiny. His treatise, _Capital_, is the\r\nsacerdotal book of Socialists. It displays a mass of learning, a\r\ndiligence of research, and acumen in the marshaling of ideas, and a\r\ncompleteness of literary expression that insures it a lasting place in\r\nthe literature of social philosophy. Whatever may be said of the\r\nnarrow dogmatism, of Marx, of his persistence in making the facts fit\r\nhis preconceived notions, of his materialistic conception of history,\r\nor of the technical flaws in his political economy, he will always be\r\nquoted as the founder of modern scientific Socialism and the Socialist\r\nhistorian of the capitalistic regime.\r\n\r\nI must content myself with a bare statement of his theories.\r\n\r\nThe economic basis of Marx is his well-known \"Theory of Surplus\r\nValue.\" It was not his theory in the sense that he originated it.\r\nEconomists like Adam Smith and especially Ricardo, Socialists like the\r\nOwenites and the Chartists in England, and Proudhon in France, had\r\nenunciated it; and in Germany Rodbertus, a lawyer and scholar of great\r\nlearning, had elaborated it in his first book, published in 1842.\r\nMarx, with German thoroughness, developed this theory in all its\r\nramifications.\r\n\r\nAll economic goods, he said, have value. They have a physical value,\r\nand a value given them by the labor expended on them. Labor is the\r\ncommon factor of economic values. And the common denominator is the\r\ntime that is consumed by the labor. Labor-time, therefore, is the\r\nuniversal measure of value, the common medium that determines values.\r\nBut this labor is acquired in the open labor market by the capitalist\r\nat the lowest possible price, a price whose utmost limit is the bare\r\ncost of living. The reward for his labor is called a wage. This wage\r\ndoes not by any means measure the value of his services. What, then,\r\nbecomes of the \"surplus value,\" the value over and above wages? The\r\ncapitalist appropriates it. Indeed, the great aim of the capitalist is\r\nto make this surplus value as big as possible. He measures his success\r\nby his profits.\r\n\r\n\"Surplus value,\" or profit, is, then, a species of robbery; it is\r\nill-gotten gain, withholding from the workman that which by right of\r\ntoil is his.\r\n\r\nHow did it come about that society was so organized as to permit this\r\nwholesale wrong upon the largest and most defenseless of its classes?\r\nIt is in answer to this question that Marx makes his most notable\r\ncontribution to Socialistic theory. With great skill, and displaying a\r\ncomprehensive knowledge of economic history, especially of English\r\nindustrial history, he traces the development of modern industrial\r\nsociety. He follows the evolution of capital from the days of medieval\r\npaternalism through the period of commercial expansion when the\r\nvoyages of discovery opened virgin fields of wealth to the trader,\r\ninto the period of inventions when the industrial revolution changed\r\nthe conditions of all classes and gave a sudden and princely power to\r\ncapital, establishing the reign of \"capitalistic production.\"\r\n\r\nAlways it was the man with capital who could take advantage of every\r\nnew commercial and industrial opportunity, and the man without capital\r\nwho was forced to succumb to the stress of new and cruel\r\ncircumstances. In every stage of development it has been the constant\r\naim of the capitalist to increase his profits and of the workingman to\r\nraise his standard of living.\r\n\r\nMarx then declares that, in order to have a capitalist society, two\r\nclasses are necessary: a capitalist and a non-capitalist class; a\r\nclass that dominates, and one that succumbs. There have always been\r\nthese two classes. Originally labor was slave, then it was serf, and\r\nnow it is free. But free labor to-day differs from serf-labor and\r\nslave-labor only in that it has a legal right to contract. The\r\neconomic results are the same as they always have been: the capitalist\r\nstill appropriates the surplus value.\r\n\r\nThe method of production, however, is very different in our\r\ncapitalistic era from the earlier eras. The industrial system herds\r\nthe workmen into factories. Property and labor is no longer\r\nindividualistic; it is social, it is corporate. Marx calls it \"social\r\nproduction and capitalistic appropriation.\" Here is the eternal\r\nantagonism between the classes, the large class of laborers and the\r\nsmall class of the \"appropriators\" of their common toil.\r\n\r\nThese factories, where labor is herded, spring up willy-nilly wherever\r\nthere is a capitalist who desires to enter business. They flood the\r\nmarkets, not by mutual consent or regulation, but by individual\r\nambitions. Each capitalist is ruled by self-interest; and\r\nself-interest impels him to make as many goods as he can and sell them\r\nat as big a profit as he can. Result, economic anarchy, called\r\n\"over-production\" or \"under-consumption\" by the economists. This leads\r\nto panics and all their attendant woes--woes that are further heaped\r\nupon the proletarian by the fact that he must compete with machinery,\r\nwhich, being more and more perfected, forces him out of the labor\r\nmarket into the street.\r\n\r\nThese crises have the tendency to concentrate industry in fewer and\r\nfewer hands; the weaker capitalist must succumb to the inevitable laws\r\nof struggle and survival. The survivors fatten on the corpses of their\r\nfallen competitors. Thus the factories grow larger and larger, the\r\nnumber of capitalists fewer and fewer; the number of proletarian\r\ndependents multiplies; the middle class is crushed out of existence;\r\nthe rich become richer and fewer, the poor more numerous and poorer.\r\n\r\nIn this turmoil of social production, capitalistic appropriation, and\r\nanarchic distribution, there is discernible a reshaping of social\r\npotencies. The proletarian realizes the power of the state and sees\r\nhow he may possess himself of that power and thereby gain control of\r\nthe economic forces and reshape them to fit the needs of a better\r\nsociety. This will mean the appropriation of the means of production\r\nand distribution by society. Private capital will vanish; surplus\r\nvalues will belong to the people who created them; the people will be\r\nmaster and servant, capitalist and laborer.\r\n\r\nThis is the Socialistic stage of society. It will be the result of the\r\nnatural evolution of human industry. Its immediate coming will be the\r\nresult of a social revolution. This revolution, this social cataclysm,\r\nis written in the nature of things. Man cannot prompt it, he cannot\r\nprevent it. He can only study the trend of things and \"alleviate the\r\nbirth-pangs\" of the new time.\r\n\r\nOf this new time, this society of to-morrow, Marx gives us no glimpse.\r\nHis function is not to prophesy, but to analyze. He is the natural\r\nhistorian of capital. He described the development of economic society\r\nand sought to ascertain its trend. In the first chapter of _Capital_\r\nhe says: \"Let us imagine an association of free men, working with\r\ncommon means of production, and putting forth, consciously, their\r\nindividual powers into one social labor power. The product of this\r\nassociation of laborers is a social product. A portion of this product\r\nserves in turn as a means of further production. It remains social\r\nproperty. The rest of this product is consumed by the members of the\r\nassociation as a means of living. It must consequently be distributed\r\namong them. The nature of this distribution will vary according to the\r\nparticular nature of the organization of production and the\r\ncorresponding grade of historical development of the producers.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the only mention of the future made by Marx. It is a dim and\r\nuncertain ray of light cast upon a vast object.\r\n\r\nThe formulae of this epoch-making study may be summarized as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Labor gives value to all economic goods. The laboring class is the\r\nproducing class, but it is deprived of its just share of the products\r\nof its labor by the capitalistic class, which appropriates the\r\n\"surplus value.\"\r\n\r\n2. This is possible because of the capitalistic method of production,\r\nwherein private capital controls the processes of production and\r\ndistribution.\r\n\r\n3. This system of private capitalism is the result of a long and\r\nlaborious process of evolution, hastened precipitately by the\r\nindustrial revolution.\r\n\r\n4. This industrial age is characterized (a) by anarchy in distribution,\r\n(b) private production, (c) the gradual disappearance of the middle\r\nclass, (d) the development of a two-class system--capitalist and\r\nproducer, (e) the rich growing richer and the poor growing poorer.\r\n\r\n5. This will not always continue. The producers are becoming fewer\r\neach year. Presently they will become so powerful as to be\r\nunendurable. Then society--the people--will appropriate private\r\ncapital and all production and distribution will be socialized.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to keep in mind the leading events in the life of this\r\nremarkable man in order to understand the genesis of his theories.\r\nMarx was born in Treves in 1818, of Jewish parentage. His mother was\r\nof Dutch descent, his father was German. When the lad was six years of\r\nage his parents embraced the Christian faith. His father was a\r\nlawyer, but his ancestors for over two hundred years had been rabbis.\r\nThe home was one of culture, where English and French as well as\r\nGerman literature and art were discussed by a circle of learned and\r\ncongenial friends. Marx studied at the universities of Bonn and\r\nBerlin. He took his doctorate in the law to please his father, but\r\nfollowed philosophy by natural bent, intending to become a university\r\nprofessor.\r\n\r\nThe turmoil of revolution was in the air and in his blood. There was\r\nno curbing of his fiery temperament into the routine of scholastic\r\nlife. In 1842 he joined the staff of the _Rhenish Gazette_ at Cologne,\r\nan organ of extreme radicalism. His drastic editorials prompted the\r\npolice to ask him to leave the country, and he went to Paris, where he\r\nmet Frederick Engels, who became his firm friend, partner of his\r\nviews, and sharer of his labors. The Prussian government demanded his\r\nremoval from Paris, and for a time he settled in Brussels. He returned\r\nto Germany to participate in the revolution of 1848, and in 1849 he\r\nwas driven to London, where, immune from Prussian persecutions, he\r\nmade his home until his death, in 1883.\r\n\r\nIn 1842 he married Jennie von Westphalen, a lady of refinement,\r\ncourage, and loyalty, whose family was prominent in Prussian politics.\r\nHer brother was at one time a minister in the Prussian cabinet.\r\n\r\nMarx was an exile practically all his life, though he never gave up\r\nhis German citizenship. He never forgot this fact. He concluded his\r\npreface to the first volume of _Capital_, written in 1873, with a\r\nbitter allusion to the \"mushroom upstarts of the new, holy Prussian\r\nGerman Empire.\" He lived a life of heroic fortitude and struggle\r\nagainst want and disease.\r\n\r\nFrom his infancy he had been taught to take a world view, an\r\ninternational view, of human affairs. This gave him an immediate\r\nadvantage over all other Socialist writers of that day. At Bonn he was\r\ncaught in the current of heterodoxy that was then sweeping through the\r\nuniversities. This carried him far into the fields of materialism,\r\nwhose philosophy of history he adopted and applied to the economic\r\ndevelopment of the race. He received not alone his philosophy from the\r\n\"Young Hegelians,\" but his dialectics as well. It gave him a\r\nphilosophy of evil which, blending with his bitter personal\r\nexperiences, gave a melancholy bent to his reasoning, and revealed to\r\nhim the misericordia of class war, the struggle of abject poverty\r\ncontending with callous capital in a bloody social revolution.\r\n\r\nThere are four points which gave Marx an immense influence over the\r\nSocialistic movement. In the first place, he put the Socialistic\r\nmovement on a historical basis; he made it inevitable. Think what this\r\nmeans, what hope and spirit it inspires in the bosom of the\r\nworkingman. But he did more than this: he made the proletarian the\r\ninstrument of destiny for the emancipation of the race from economic\r\nthraldom. This was to be accomplished by class war and social\r\nrevolution. Marx imparts the zeal of fatalism to his Socialism when he\r\nlinks it to the necessities of nature. By natural law a bourgeoisie\r\ndeveloped; by natural law it oppresses the proletarian; by natural\r\nlaw, by the compulsion of inexorable processes, the proletarians alone\r\ncan attain their freedom. Capitalism becomes its own grave-digger.\r\nLiebknecht said in his Erfurt speech (1891): \"The capitalistic state\r\nof the present begets against its will the state of the future.\"\r\n\r\nIn the third place, Marx gave a formula to the Socialist movement. He\r\ndefined Socialism in one sentence: \"The social ownership of the means\r\nof production and distribution.\" This was necessary. From among the\r\nvague and incoherent mass of utopian and revolutionary literature he\r\ncoined the sentence that could be repeated with gusto and the flavor\r\nof scientific terminology.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, he refrained from detailing the new society. He laid down\r\nno program except war, he pointed to no utopia except co-operation.\r\nThis offended no one and left Socialists of all schools free to\r\nconstruct their own details.\r\n\r\nThe Marxian system was no sooner enunciated than it was shown to be\r\nfallible as an economic generalization; and the passing of several\r\ndecades has proved that the tendencies he deemed inevitable are not\r\ntaking place. The refutation of his theory of value by the Austrian\r\neconomist, Adolph Menger, is by economists considered complete and\r\nfinal. The materialistic conception of history, which is the soul of\r\nhis work, lends itself more to the passion of a virile propaganda than\r\nto a sober interpretation of the facts. Further, the two practical\r\nresults that flow from the use of his theory of surplus value and his\r\nmaterialism--namely, the ever-increasing volume of poverty and the\r\never-decreasing number of capitalists--are not borne out by the facts.\r\nThe number of capitalists is constantly increasing, in spite of the\r\ndevelopment of enormous trusts; the middle class is constantly being\r\nrecruited from the lower class; there is no apparent realization of\r\nthe two-class system. And finally, the method by revolution is being\r\nmore and more discarded by Socialists, as they see that intolerable\r\nconditions are being more and more alleviated, that \"man's inhumanity\r\nto man\" is a constantly diminishing factor in the bitter struggle for\r\nexistence.[17]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] _New Christianity_, p. 38, English edition, 1834.\r\n\r\n[2] Saint-Simon's principal writings are: _Lettres d'un Habitant de\r\nGeneve_, 1803; _L'Organisateur_, 1819; _Du Systeme Industriel_, 1821;\r\n_Catechisme des Industriels_, 1823; _Nouveau Christianisme_, 1825.

IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE POLITICAL AWAKENING OF SOCIALISM--THE PERIOD OF REVOLUTION\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of our inquiry the most significant event in\r\nthe history of Socialism is its entrance into politics. This endows\r\nthe workingman with a new power and a great power; a power that will\r\nbring him farther on his way toward the goal he seeks than any other\r\nhe possesses. Because the modern state is democratic, and the\r\ndemocratic state bends in the direction of the mass. The revolutions\r\nattempted in the middle of the last century are child's play compared\r\nwith the changes that can be wrought when constitutions and courts,\r\nparliaments and administrative systems, become the instruments of a\r\ndetermined, self-possessed, and united political consciousness.\r\n\r\nScarcely half a century elapsed between the French utopians and the\r\ntime when the proletarians organized actual political parties, and\r\narrayed themselves against the older orders in the struggle for\r\npolitical privilege. In the interval, revolution had its brief hour,\r\nand reaction its days of waiting.\r\n\r\nThe French Revolution was a necessary preliminary to the proletarian\r\nmovement. It was the most powerful instrument for the propagation of\r\nthose democratic ideas that were so attractively clothed by Rousseau\r\nand so terribly distorted by the revolutionists. While this revolution\r\nwas a bourgeois movement, not a proletarian uprising, not a\r\nrevolution in the sense that Marx, for instance, uses the word, it\r\nmust not be forgotten that the proletarians were in the revolution.\r\nThe dark and sullen background of that tragedy was the mass of\r\nunspeakably poor. They were not machine workers whose abjectness came\r\nfrom factory conditions, like the workmen of England a few decades\r\nlater. They were proletarians without a class consciousness, but with\r\na class grievance; proletarians in the literal sense of the word,\r\npoor, ragged, hungry, wretched.\r\n\r\nSuch democracy as was achieved by the revolution was bourgeois. The\r\npowers of monarchy were transferred from the \"privileged\" classes to\r\nthe middle class, who, in turn, became the privileged ones. The day of\r\nmiddle-class government had come. The class that had financed the\r\nfleets of adventurers to new and unexploited continents, and had\r\nbacked the inventions of Arkwright and Hargreaves, were now in power\r\nin politics as well as in commerce and industry. A unity of purpose\r\nbetween industry and statecraft was thus achieved; new ideals became\r\ndominant. The patriarchal precepts of the feudal manors were\r\nforgotten. The people were no longer children of a great household\r\nwith their king at the head. The king, when he was retained, was shorn\r\nof his universal fatherhood, and remained a mere remnant of ermine and\r\nvelvet, a royal trader in social distinctions.\r\n\r\nWhile the old ideal, the feudal ideal, prevailed, governing was the\r\n_duty_ of a class. The newer ideal made governing an incident in the\r\nactivities of a class whose dominating impulse was the making of\r\nprofits. These ideals are at polar points; one deals with things, the\r\nother with men.\r\n\r\nThe change in the form of government was wrought while the people were\r\ntalking about the glittering abstractions of equality, liberty,\r\njustice, as if they were commodities to be exchanged in the political\r\nmarkets. The newer form of government marked an advance on the older.\r\nIt represented a step forward in human political experience. A larger\r\ngroup of citizens was drawn into the widening circle of governmental\r\nactivities. It was an inevitable step. The discovery of the New World\r\nand the invention of machinery were making a new earth--an\r\nunattractive earth, but nevertheless a new one. The balance of power\r\nwas shifting from hereditary privilege to commercial privilege, and\r\nnations were fulfilling the law of human nature, that the power of the\r\nstate reposes in the hands of the dominant class. The dominant class\r\nis actuated by its dominant idea. In the aristocratic class it is\r\npolitics, in the middle class it is trade.\r\n\r\nAll this inevitably accentuated the proletarian's position in the\r\nstate. Under the older regime, as historians of our economic\r\ndevelopment have clearly shown, the antagonisms and grievances were\r\nfewer. The trader and the craftsman were overshadowed by the lord and\r\nthe bishop. Social, political, and economical values were distributed\r\nby custom and imposed by heredity, rather than by individual effort or\r\nindividual capacity. When, therefore, this great change came over\r\nsociety, a change that would have been unthinkable in the days of\r\nCharlemagne or of Elizabeth,--a change that virtually destroyed the\r\nmost powerful of the classes and put human beings onto a basis of\r\ncompetition rather than of birth, and shifted power from tradition to\r\neffort, and transferred values from prerogatives to gold,--then the\r\nwhole class problem changed, and entirely new antagonisms were\r\ncreated.\r\n\r\nThe first movements of the new proletarians were mob movements.\r\nActuated more by a desire to revenge themselves than to better\r\nthemselves, they gather in the dark hours of the night and move\r\nsullenly upon the factories, to destroy their enemies, the machines.\r\nThey pillage the buildings and threaten the house of their employer,\r\nwhom they consider the agent of their undoing. In France and Germany,\r\nand especially in England, these infuriated workmen try to undo by\r\nviolence what has been achieved by invention.\r\n\r\nWhen their first fury is abated and they see new machinery taking the\r\nplace of that which they have destroyed, and new factories built on\r\nthe foundations of those they have burned, they see the impotence of\r\ntheir actions. In England a new movement begins. They try to re-enact\r\nthe Elizabethan statute of laborers, to bring back the days of\r\nhandicrafts, of journeyman and apprentice. They soon learned that the\r\nold era had vanished, never to return. The workingman possessed\r\nneither the power nor the ingenuity to bring it back. He turned, next,\r\nto possess himself of the machinery of the state.\r\n\r\nPolitical conditions paved the way. France, after her orgy, had fallen\r\nback into absolutism. Germany and Austria had remained feudal in the\r\nmost distasteful sense of the word; the nobility retained their\r\nancient privileges and forsook their ancient duties. The landlord\r\nclass even retained jurisdiction over their tenants. The old industry\r\nhad been destroyed by Napoleon's campaigns; the new machine industry\r\ndid not establish itself until after the enactment of protective\r\ntariffs and the creation \"Zollverein,\" in 1818. This cemented the\r\nbourgeois interests. Manufacturers, traders, and bankers achieved a\r\nhomogeneity of interest and ambition which was antagonistic to the\r\nspirit of the _junker_ and the feudalist. The new bourgeoisie wanted\r\nlaws favorable to trade expansion. They needed the law-making\r\nmachinery to achieve this. By 1840 the upper middle class had become\r\nfeverish for political power. They imbibed the doctrines of the\r\nliterature of that period which preached a constitutional\r\nrepublicanism. Hegel gave the weighty sanction of philosophy to the\r\noverthrow of absolute monarchy.\r\n\r\nThe great mass of the people were, of course, workingmen, small\r\ntraders, and shopkeepers, and the rural peasantry. The small trader\r\nwas dependent upon the favors of the ruling class on the one hand, and\r\nof the banker and manufacturer on the other hand. When the interests\r\nof these two clashed he was alarmed, for he could neither remain\r\nneutral nor take sides. The peasants were abject subjects, little\r\nbetter than serfs. The laboring men, as we shall see presently, were\r\nachieving a mass consciousness.\r\n\r\nIn Germany Frederick William, the Romantic, was face to face with\r\nrevolution. This was not an economic revolution. It was a political\r\nrevolution. It was joined by the communists and the Socialists. Marx\r\nhimself, was a leader in the revolt, and one of its most faithful\r\nchroniclers. In 1844 the weavers of Silesia rose in revolt. There was\r\nrioting and bloodshed. This was followed by bread riots in various\r\nparts of Germany. In 1848 the whole country was in the turmoil of\r\nrevolution, a revolution led by the upper middle class, but prompted\r\nand fired by the zeal of the proletarians, who, in some of the\r\ncities, notably Berlin, became the leading factor in the uprising.\r\nMarx says: \"There was then no separate Republican party in Germany.\r\nPeople were either constitutional monarchists or more or less clearly\r\ndefined Socialists or communists.\"[1]\r\n\r\nIn Austria conditions were even more reactionary than in Germany.\r\nMetternich, the powerful representative of the ancient order of\r\nthings, had a haughty contempt for the demands of the constitutional\r\nparty. With the hauteur of absolutism he not only retained political\r\npower in the feudal class, but suppressed literature, censored\r\nlearning, and rigorously superintended religion. A greater power than\r\ncaste and tradition was slowly eating its way into this country, which\r\nhad attempted to isolate itself from the rest of the world. This was\r\nthe power of machine industry. It brought with it, as in every other\r\ncountry, a new class, the manufacturers, who, as soon as their\r\nbusiness began to expand, sought favorable laws. This led them into\r\npolitical activity, which, in turn, brought friction with the\r\nfeudalists. Both sides took to the field. The revolution broke in\r\nVienna, March 13, 1848, seventeen days after the revolutionists had\r\ndriven Louis Philippe out of Paris, and five days before the Prussian\r\nking delivered himself into the hands of a Berlin mob.\r\n\r\nIt was in France that the revolution assumed its most virulent\r\ncharacter. In Paris the revolution was \"carried on between the mass of\r\nthe working people on the one hand and all the other classes of the\r\nParisian population, supported by the army, on the other.\"[2] This\r\nParisian proletarian uprising was the red signal of warning to Germany\r\nand Austria. The bourgeois were now as anxious to rid themselves of\r\nthe Socialist contingent as they had been eager for its support when\r\nthey began their struggle for political power. Compromises between\r\nfeudalists and commercialists were effected, and a sort of\r\nconstitutionalism became the basis of the reconstructed governments.\r\n\r\nOf these revolutions Marx says: \"In all cases the real fighting body\r\nof the insurgents, that body which first took up arms and gave battle\r\nto the troops, consisted of the working classes of the towns. A\r\nportion of the poorer country population, laborers and petty farmers,\r\ngenerally joined them after the outbreak of the conflict.\"[3]\r\n\r\nThey were not merely bourgeois uprisings. The Parisian revolution was\r\nvirtually a proletarian rebellion. Here \"the proletariat, because it\r\ndictated the Republic to the provisional government, and through the\r\nprovisional government to the whole of France, stepped at once forth\r\nas an independent, self-contained party; and it at once arrayed the\r\nentire bourgeoisie of France against itself.... Marche, a workingman,\r\ndictated a decree wherein the newly formed provincial government\r\npledged itself to secure the position of the workingman through work,\r\nto do away with bourgeois labor, etc. And as they seemed to forget\r\nthis promise, a few days later 200,000 workingmen marched upon the\r\nHotel de Ville with the battle-cry, 'Organization of labor! Create a\r\nministry of labor!' and after a prolonged debate the provisional\r\ngovernment named a permanent special commission for the purpose of\r\nfinding the means for bettering the conditions of the working\r\nclasses.\"[4]\r\n\r\nIt is evident that Marx considered the revolutions of 1848-50 as a\r\ncompound of proletarian and bourgeois uprisings against _feudal_\r\nremnants in government. He is not always clear in his own mind as to\r\nthe direction of these movements. But we now know that the direction\r\nwas toward democracy.\r\n\r\nThe French, or Parisian, uprising was more \"advanced\" than the other\r\nContinental attempts. The Parisians had piled barricades before; they\r\nwere experienced in the bloody business.\r\n\r\nThey tried again in 1871. This time the workingmen ruled Paris for two\r\nmonths. It was a bloody, turbulent period. Marx characterized it as\r\n\"the glorious workingman's revolution of the 18th of March,\" and the\r\nCommune \"as a lever for uprooting the economical foundations upon\r\nwhich rests the existence of classes, and therefore of class rule.\"\r\nIts acts of violence he extolled, its burning of public buildings was\r\na \"self-holocaust.\" This \"workingman's Paris, with its Commune, will\r\nbe forever celebrated as the glorious harbinger of a new society.\"[5]\r\n\r\nSo the attempt to possess the state by revolution has been tried by\r\nthe proletarian. The revolutions were all abortive. The Socialists say\r\nthey were ill-timed. Writing in 1895, Frederick Engels, the companion\r\nof Marx, could see these uprisings in a different perspective. He\r\nacknowledged the mistake made by the Socialists in believing that they\r\ncould by violence somehow become the deciding factor in the\r\ngovernment, and therefore in the economic arrangement of society.\r\n\"History has shown us our error,\" he says. \"Time has made it clear\r\nthat the status of economic development on the Continent was far from\r\nripe for the setting aside of the capitalistic regime.\"[6]\r\n\r\nThese revolutions were not merely bourgeois, as is so often affirmed.\r\nThere was everywhere a large element of Socialistic unrest. They were\r\nrevolutions begun in the fever heat of youth--\"Young Germany,\" \"Young\r\nAustria,\" \"Young Italy,\" were moved by \"Young Hegelians\" and \"Young\r\nCommunists.\" They embraced bourgeois tradesmen and proletarian\r\nworkingmen, who, in their new-found delirium, thought that with \"the\r\noverthrow of the reactionary governments, the kingdom of heaven would\r\nbe realized on earth.\"[7] \"They had no idea,\" continues Kautsky, who\r\nspeaks on these questions with authority, \"that the overthrow of these\r\ngovernments would not be the end, but the beginning of revolutions;\r\nthat the newly won bourgeois freedom would be the battleground for\r\nthe great class war between proletarian and bourgeois; that liberty\r\ndid not bring social freedom, but social warfare.\"\r\n\r\nThis is to-day the orthodox Socialist view. It believes that these\r\nrevolutions taught the proletarians the folly of ill-timed violence;\r\nrevealed to them their friends and their enemies; and, above all, gave\r\nthem a class consciousness.\r\n\r\nLet us turn, for a moment, to a proletarian movement of a somewhat\r\ndifferent type, the Chartist movement in England. The flame of\r\nrevolution that enveloped Europe crossed the Channel to England and\r\nIreland. But here revolution took a different course. In Ireland it\r\nwas the brilliant O'Connell's agitation against the Act of Union; in\r\nEngland it was the workingman's protest against his exclusion from the\r\nReform Act of 1832, an act that itself had been born amidst the throes\r\nof mob violence and incipient revolution.\r\n\r\nThe Chartist movement was promulgated by the \"Workingmen's\r\nAssociation.\" It was a workingman's protest. Its organizers were\r\ncarpenters, its orators were tailors and blacksmiths and weavers,\r\nsurprising themselves and their audiences with their new-found\r\neloquence, and its writers were cotton spinners. The Reform Bill had\r\nbeen a bitter disappointment to them. It gave the right of suffrage to\r\nthe middle class, but withheld it from the working class. A few\r\nradical members of Parliament met with representatives of the\r\nworkingmen and drafted a bill. O'Connell, as he handed the measure to\r\nthe secretary of the association, said: \"There is your charter\"--and\r\nthe \"People's Charter\" it was called. Its \"six points\" were: Manhood\r\nsuffrage, annual Parliaments, election by ballot, abolition of\r\nproperty qualifications for election of members to Parliament, payment\r\nof members of Parliament, and equitably devised electoral districts.\r\nThese are all political demands, all democratic. But economic\r\nconditions pressed them to the foreground. The \"Bread Tax\" was as much\r\nan issue as the ballot. They demanded the ballot so that they might\r\nremove the tax. \"Misery and discontent were its strongest\r\ninspirations,\" says McCarthy.[8]\r\n\r\nCarlyle saw the inwardness of the movement. \"All along for the last\r\nfive and twenty years it was curious to note how the internal\r\ndiscontent of England struggled to find vent for itself through any\r\norifice; the poor patient, all sick from center to surface, complains\r\nnow of this member, now of that: corn laws, currency laws, free trade,\r\nprotection, want of free trade: the poor patient, tossing from side to\r\nside seeking a sound side to lie on, finds none.\"\r\n\r\nOne of its own crude and forceful orators said on Kersall Moor to\r\n200,000 turbulent workingmen of Manchester: \"Chartism, my friends, is\r\nno mere political movement, where the main point is your getting the\r\nballot. Chartism is a knife and fork question. The charter means a\r\ngood house, good food and drink, prosperity, and short working\r\nhours.\"[9]\r\n\r\nThe protest of this discontent became the nearest approach to a\r\nrevolution England had encountered since Charles I. Monster meetings,\r\nfor the first time called \"mass meetings,\" were held in every county,\r\nand evenings, after working hours, enormous parades were organized,\r\neach participant carrying a torch, hence they were called \"torchlight\r\nparades.\" These two spectacular features were soon adopted by American\r\ncampaigners. A wild and desperate feeling seized the masses. \"You see\r\nyonder factory with its towering chimney,\" cried one of its orators.\r\n\"Every brick in that factory is cemented with the blood of women and\r\nchildren.\" And again: \"If the rights of the poor are trampled under\r\nfoot, then down with the throne, down with aristocracy, down with the\r\nbishops, down with the clergy, burn the churches, down with all rank,\r\nall title, and all dignity.\"[10]\r\n\r\nIn their great petition to Parliament, signed by several million\r\npeople, the agitators said: \"The Reform Act has effected a transfer of\r\npower from one domineering faction to another and left the people as\r\nhelpless as before.\" \"We demand universal suffrage. The suffrage, to\r\nbe exempt from the corruption of the wealthy and the violence of the\r\npowerful, must be secret.\" The whole movement had all the aspects of a\r\nmodern, violent general strike. Its papers, _The Poor Man's Guardian_,\r\n_The Destructive_, and others, were full of tirades against wealth and\r\nprivilege. When the agitation became an uprising in Wales, there was a\r\nconflict between the Chartists and the police in which a number were\r\nkilled and wounded. In the industrial centers, soldiers were present\r\nat the meetings, and the outcry against the use of the military was\r\nthe same that is heard to-day. A number of the leaders were tried for\r\nsedition, and the courts became the objects of abuse as they are\r\nto-day. It was a labor war for political privilege; a class war for\r\neconomic advantages.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF THE PERIOD OF REVOLUTION\r\n\r\nThese revolutions were political in that they were a protest against\r\nexisting governmental forms. The revolutionary proletarian was found\r\nin all of them. He not only stood under the standard of Daniel Manin\r\nin Venice, when that patriot again proclaimed a republic in the\r\nancient city, and shared with Mazzini his triumph in Rome, and fought\r\nwith Kossuth for the liberty of Hungary; but he formed also the body\r\nof the revolutionary forces in Germany, Austria, and France.\r\n\r\nIn all the Continental countries the uprisings were directed against\r\nthe arrogance and oppression of monarchism, and against the\r\nrecrudescence of feudalistic ideals. In France Louis Philippe had\r\nattempted the part of a petty despot. He restricted the ballot to the\r\npropertied class, balanced his power on too narrow a base, and it\r\nbecame top-heavy.\r\n\r\nWhile the workingmen of Germany and Austria were taking up arms under\r\ncommand of the middle class against the feudal remnants, the\r\nworkingmen of France were sacking their capital because of an\r\nattempted revival of monarchic privilege, and the workmen of England\r\nwere marching and counter-marching in monster torchlight parades in\r\nprotest against middle-class domination.\r\n\r\nThe panorama of Europe in these years of turmoil and blood thus\r\nexhibits every degree of revolt against governmental power, from the\r\nabsolutism of Prussian Junkerdom and the oppression of the Hungarians\r\nby foreign tyranny, to the dominance of the aristocratic and\r\nmiddle-class alliance in Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThe bread-and-butter question was not wanting in any of these\r\npolitical uprisings. The unity of life makes their separation a myth.\r\nOne is interwoven with the other. The social struggle is political,\r\nthe political struggle is social.\r\n\r\nSocialism is not merely an economic movement. It seeks to-day, and\r\nalways has sought, the power of the state. The government is the only\r\navailable instrument for effecting the change--the revolution--the\r\nSocialists preach, the transfer of productive enterprise from private\r\nto public ownership. \"Political power our means, social happiness our\r\nend,\" was a Chartist motto. That is the duality of Socialism to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] MARX, _Revolution and Counter-Revolution in 1848_.\r\n\r\n[2] MARX, _Revolution and Counter-Revolution_, p. 70.\r\n\r\n[3] _Op. cit._, pp. 123-124.\r\n\r\n[4] MARX, _Die Klassenkaempfe in Frankreich_, pp. 26-28.\r\n\r\n[5] See the third address issued by the International Workingmen's\r\nAssociation on the Franco-Prussian war, 1870-71.\r\n\r\nThe Italian Socialists in Milan, June, 1871, closed a rhetorical\r\naddress to the Parisian Communards as follows: \"To despotism they\r\nresponded, We are free.\r\n\r\n\"To the cannon and chassepots of the leagued reactionists they offered\r\ntheir bared breasts.\r\n\r\n\"They fell, but fell like heroes.\r\n\r\n\"To-day the reaction calls them bandits, places them under the ban of\r\nthe human race.\r\n\r\n\"Shall we permit it?

The exiled agitators and revolutionists\r\nmet, naturally, in their cities of refuge for the discussion of their\r\ncommon grievances. They complained that \"the proletarian has no\r\nfatherland,\" and internationalism became their patriotism.\r\n\r\nIn Paris a few of the ostracized Socialists, in 1836, founded \"The\r\nLeague of the Just,\" a communistic secret society.[2] The group were\r\ncompelled to leave Paris because they were implicated in a riot, and\r\nwhen some of them met in London they invited other refugees to join\r\nthem. Among them was Marx, and his presence soon bore fruit. Their\r\nmotto, \"All men are brethren,\" was singularly paradoxical when\r\ncontrasted with their methods of sinister conspiracy. Marx, with his\r\nsuperior intellect, at once began to reshape their ideas, a\r\nreorganization was effected called \"The Communist League,\" and Marx\r\nand Engels were delegated to write a statement of principles for the\r\nLeague. That statement, written in 1847, they called \"The Communist\r\nManifesto.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Manifesto\" is the most influential of all Socialist documents. It\r\nis at once a firebrand and a formulary. Its formulae are the well-known\r\nMarxian principles; its energy is the youthful vigor and zeal of\r\nardent revolutionists. Nearly all the generalizations of _Capital_ are\r\nfound in the \"Manifesto.\" This is important, for it gave the sanction\r\nof a social theory to the Socialist movement. Hitherto there had been\r\nonly utopian generalizations and keen denunciations of the existing\r\norder. It was of the greatest importance that early in the development\r\nof the movement it was given an economic theory expressed in such\r\nlucid terms, with the gusto of youth, and in the terminology of\r\nscience, that it remains to-day the best synopsis of Marx's\r\n\"Scientific Socialism.\"\r\n\r\nAs a piece of campaign literature it is unexcelled. Combined with its\r\nclearness of statement, its economic reasoning, its terrific\r\narraignment of modern industrial society, there is a lofty zeal and\r\npower that placed it in the front rank of propagandist literature.\r\n\r\nEngels, the surviving partner of the Marxian movement, wrote in the\r\npreface of the edition of 1888:\r\n\r\n\"The 'Manifesto' being our joint production, I consider myself bound to\r\nsay that the fundamental proposition which forms its nucleus belongs to\r\nMarx.\" That proposition embraced the materialistic theory of social\r\nevolution, that \"the whole history of mankind has been a history of\r\nclass struggles ... in which nowadays a stage has been reached where\r\nthe exploited and oppressed classes--the proletariat--cannot attain\r\ntheir emancipation from the sway of the exploiting and ruling\r\nclasses--the bourgeoisie--without at the same time and once for all\r\nemancipating society at large from all exploitation, oppression, class\r\ndistinctions, and class struggles.\"\r\n\r\nThis liberation was, of course, to be accomplished by revolution. The\r\n\"Manifesto\" closes with these spirited and oft-quoted words:\r\n\r\n\"The communists disdain to conceal their views and aims. They openly\r\ndeclare that their ends can be obtained only by the forcible overthrow\r\nof all existing social conditions. Let the ruling class tremble at a\r\ncommunist revolution. The proletarians have nothing to lose but their\r\nchains, they have a world to win. Workingmen of all countries, unite.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the language and the spirit of the times. The \"Manifesto\" was\r\npublished only a few days before the February revolution of 1848. For\r\na moment the ruling class did tremble; but the ill-timed uprisings\r\nwere promptly suppressed and the days of reaction set in.\r\n\r\nSoon the workingmen of different countries were busy with the\r\nstupendous development of industry which followed in the wake of the\r\nwars and revolutions that had harassed the Continent for over fifty\r\nyears. The revival of industry brought a renewal of international\r\ntrade. This was followed by a wider exchange of views and greater\r\ninternational intimacy. In 1862 the first International Exposition was\r\nheld.\r\n\r\nBefore we proceed with the development of the \"Old International,\" as\r\nit is now called, let us notice three points about the \"Manifesto.\"\r\nFirst, it was not called the \"Socialist Manifesto,\" although adopted\r\nby Socialists the world over. Engels, in his preface of 1888, tells us\r\nwhy. \"When it was written we could not have called it a Socialist\r\nManifesto. By Socialist, in 1847, were understood, on the one hand,\r\nthe adherents of the various Utopian systems; Owenites in England,\r\nFourierists in France, both of them already reduced to the position of\r\nmere sects, and gradually dying out; on the other hand, the most\r\nmultifarious social quacks who, by all manner of tinkering, professed\r\nto redress, without any danger to capital and profit, all sorts of\r\nsocial grievances; in both cases men outside the working-class\r\nmovement, and looking rather to the 'educated' classes for support.\r\nWhatever portion of the working class had become convinced of the\r\ninsufficiency of mere political revolutions, and had proclaimed the\r\nnecessity of a total social change, that portion then called itself\r\ncommunist. It was a crude, rough-hewn, purely instinctive sort of\r\ncommunism; still it touched the cardinal point and was powerful enough\r\namongst the working class to produce the utopian communism in France\r\nof Cabet, and in Germany of Weitling. This Socialism was, in 1847, a\r\nmiddle-class movement; communism a working-class movement. Socialism\r\nwas, on the Continent at least, 'respectable'; communism was the very\r\nopposite.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to know how Engels would define Socialism\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nSecond, it is important for us to know that the \"Manifesto\" recognized\r\nthe necessity of using the government as the instrument for achieving\r\nthe new society. \"The immediate aim of the communists,\" it recites,\r\n\"is the conquest of political power by the proletariat\"; to \"labor\r\neverywhere for the union and agreement of the democratic parties of\r\nall countries.\"\r\n\r\nThe governmental organization of the communists' state was to be\r\ndemocratic.\r\n\r\nThirdly, a provisional program of such a politico-socio-democratic\r\nparty is suggested in the \"Manifesto.\" Its principal points are:\r\n\r\n    \"1. Abolition of property in land and application of all rents\r\n    of land to public purposes.\r\n\r\n    \"2. A heavy progressive or graduated income tax.\r\n\r\n    \"3. Abolition of all rights of inheritance.\r\n\r\n    \"4. Confiscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels.\r\n\r\n    \"5. Centralization of credit in the hands of the state, by means\r\n    of a national bank with state capital and an exclusive monopoly.\r\n\r\n    \"6. Centralization of the means of communication and transport\r\n    in the hands of the state.\r\n\r\n    \"7. Extension of factories and the instruments of production\r\n    owned by the state: the bringing into cultivation of waste\r\n    lands, and the improvement of the soil generally, in accordance\r\n    with a common plan.\r\n\r\n    \"8. Equal liability of all labor. Establishment of industrial\r\n    armies, especially for agriculture.\r\n\r\n    \"9. Combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries;\r\n    gradual abolition between town and country, by a more equable\r\n    distribution of population over the country.\r\n\r\n    \"10. Free education for all children in public schools,\r\n    combination of education with industrial production,\" _etc._\r\n\r\nThough the \"Manifesto\" was written in 1848, neither Marx, who lived\r\nuntil 1882, nor Engels, who died in 1895, made any alteration in it,\r\non the ground that it had become \"a historical document which we have\r\nno longer any right to alter.\"[3]\r\n\r\n\"However much the state of things may have altered during the last\r\ntwenty-five years, the general principles laid down in this manifesto\r\nare, on the whole, as correct to-day as ever.\"[4]\r\n\r\nOn one very important point, however, they could not refrain from\r\nfurther comment. The revolutionary language in the original draft\r\nwould be radically mollified if written at the time of the joint\r\npreface in 1872. The example of the Paris Commune was disheartening.\r\nIt demonstrated that \"the working class cannot simply lay hold of the\r\nready-made state machinery and wield it for its own purposes.\"[5]\r\n\r\nThese, then, were the principles of the international movement of\r\nwhich the \"Manifesto\" was the supreme expression. When labor had\r\nrevived from its first stupor, after the hard blows it received in the\r\nyears of revolution, the \"Manifesto\" was translated into several\r\nContinental languages. With the revival of internationalism, it has\r\nbeen translated into every language of the industrial world, and I am\r\ntold a Japanese and a Turkish edition have been issued. This is a\r\ngauge of the spread of international Socialism.\r\n\r\nIn 1862 a number of French workingmen, visiting the International\r\nExhibition in London, were entertained by the Socialist exiles, and\r\nthe question of reviving an international movement was discussed. Two\r\nyears later, in St. Martin's Hall, London, workingmen from various\r\ncountries organized a meeting and selected Mazzini, the Italian\r\npatriot, to draw up a constitution. But the South European view of\r\nclass war was out of accord with the German and French views, and\r\nMazzini's proposals were rejected. Marx then undertook the writing of\r\nthe address. He succeeded remarkably well in avoiding the giving of\r\noffense to the four different elements present, namely, the trade\r\nunionists of England, who, being Englishmen, were averse to\r\nrevolutions; the followers of Proudhon in France, who were then\r\nestablishing free co-operative societies; the followers of Lassalle in\r\nGermany and Louis Blanc in France, who glorified state aid in\r\nco-operation; and the less easily satisfied contingent of Mazzini from\r\nSpain and Italy.\r\n\r\nMarx's diplomacy and his international vocabulary stood him in good\r\nstead. He began the \"Address\" by a clever rhetorical parallelism.\r\nGladstone, whose splendor then filled the political heavens, had just\r\ndelivered a great speech in which he had gloried in the wonderful\r\nincrease in Britain's trade and wealth. Marx contrasted this growth in\r\nriches with the misery and poverty and wretchedness of the English\r\nworking classes. Gladstone's small army of rich bourgeois were\r\nadroitly compared with Marx's large army of miserably poor. The growth\r\nof wealth, he said, brought no amelioration to the needy. But in this\r\npicture of gloom were two points of hope: first, the ten-hour working\r\nday had been achieved through great struggles, and it showed what the\r\nproletarian can do if he persists in fighting for his rights. Second,\r\nMarx alluded to the co-operative achievements of France and Germany as\r\na proof that the laboring man could organize and carry on great\r\nindustries without the intervention of capitalists. With these two\r\nelements of hope before them, the laborers should be of good cheer.\r\nMarx admonished them that they had _numbers_ on their side, and all\r\nthat is necessary for complete victory is organization. In closing he\r\nrepeats the battle-cry of '48: \"Workingmen of all lands, unite!\"\r\n\r\nThe \"statutes,\" or by-laws[6] were also drawn by Marx. The preamble is\r\na second \"Manifesto,\" in which he reiterates the necessity for\r\ninternational co-operation among workingmen, and concludes: \"The First\r\nInternational Labor Congress declares that the International\r\nWorkingmen's Association, and all societies and individuals belonging\r\nto it, recognize truth, right, and morality as the basis of their\r\nconduct towards one another and their fellowmen, without respect to\r\ncolor, creed, or nationality. This congress regards it as the duty of\r\nman to demand the rights of a man and citizen, not only for himself,\r\nbut for every one who does his duty. No rights without duties, no\r\nduties without rights.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Address\" and the \"Statutes\" were adopted by the association at\r\nits first congress, held in Geneva in September, 1866, where sixty\r\ndelegates represented the new movement. With the vicissitudes of\r\nMarx's International we are not especially concerned here. It met\r\nannually in various cities until 1873, when its last meeting was held\r\nat Geneva.\r\n\r\nMarx had successfully avoided offense to the various elements in his\r\nmasterly address and preamble. But the organization contained\r\nirreconcilable elements more or less jealous of one another. The two\r\nextremes were the Anarchists, led by the Russian Bakunin, and the\r\nEnglish labor unions. The Anarchists believed in overthrowing\r\neverything, the English laborists abhorred violence. Between these two\r\nextremes stood Marx's doctrine of evolutionary revolution, as\r\ndistasteful to the English as it was despised by the Anarchists.\r\n\r\nWhen the congress met at The Hague, in September, 1872, Marx was one\r\nof the sixty-five delegates. He had hitherto held himself aloof from\r\nthe meetings. But here even his magnetic presence could not prevent\r\nthe breach with Bakunin.[7] There were stormy scenes. The Anarchists\r\nwere expelled, and the seat of the general council was transferred to\r\nNew York, where it could die an unobserved death.\r\n\r\nBefore the final adjournment a meeting was held in Amsterdam. Here\r\nMarx delivered a powerful speech characterized by all the arts of\r\nexpression of which he was master. He compared these humble \"assizes\r\nof labor\" with the royal conferences of \"kings and potentates\" who in\r\ncenturies past had been wont to meet at The Hague \"to discuss the\r\ninterests of their dynasties.\" He admitted that in England, the United\r\nStates, and maybe in Holland, \"the workmen might attain their goal by\r\npeaceful means. But in most European countries force must be the lever\r\nof revolution, and to force they must appeal when the time comes.\"\r\n\r\nThese were his last personal words to his International, the\r\ncrystallization of his lifelong endeavor to lead the workingmen's\r\ncause. There was one more meeting at Geneva, in 1873; then it\r\nperished.\r\n\r\nBakunin's following, renamed the International Alliance of Social\r\nDemocracy, meanwhile went the way of all violent revolutionists. They\r\ntook part in the uprisings in Spain in 1873; the rebellion was\r\npromptly suppressed, and the alliance came to an end.\r\n\r\nDuring its brief existence the International was the red bogey-man of\r\nEuropean courts. The most violent and bloodthirsty ambitions were\r\nascribed to it. Such conservative and careful newspapers as the London\r\n_Times_ indulged in the most extreme editorials and news items about\r\nthe sinister organization that was soon to \"bathe the thrones of\r\nEurope in blood\" and \"despoil property of its rights\" and \"human\r\nsociety of its blessings.\"\r\n\r\nIn the light of history, these fears appear ridiculous. The poor,\r\nstruggling organization that could summon scarcely one hundred members\r\nto an international convention was powerful only in the possession of\r\nan idea, the conviction of international solidarity. Its plotting\r\nhandful of Anarchists were a great hindrance to it, and the events of\r\nthe Commune put the stamp of veracity on the dire things the public\r\npress had foretold of its ambitions.\r\n\r\nThe programs discussed at the various meetings are of more importance\r\nto us because they reveal whatever was practical in Marx's\r\norganization. For the second meeting, 1866, the following outline was\r\nsent out by the general council from London. It was unquestionably\r\nprepared by Marx himself.\r\n\r\n    \"1. Organization of the International Association; its ends; its\r\n    means of action.\r\n\r\n    \"2. Workingmen's societies--their past, present, and future:\r\n    stoppage, strikes--means of remedying them; primary and\r\n    professional instruction.\r\n\r\n    \"3. Work of women and children in factories, from a moral and\r\n    sanitary point of view.\r\n\r\n    \"4. Reduction of working hours--its end, bearing, and moral\r\n    consequences; obligation of labor for all.\r\n\r\n    \"5. Association--its principle, its application; co-operation as\r\n    distinguished from association proper.\r\n\r\n    \"6. Relation of capital and labor; foreign competition;\r\n    commercial treaties.\r\n\r\n    \"7. Direct and indirect taxes.\r\n\r\n    \"8. International institutions--mutual credit, paper money,\r\n    weights, measures, coins, and language.\r\n\r\n    \"9. Necessity of abolishing the Russian influence in Europe by\r\n    the application of the principle of the right of the people to\r\n    govern themselves; and the reconstitution of Poland upon a\r\n    democratic and social basis.\r\n\r\n    \"10. Standing armies and their relation to production.\r\n\r\n    \"11. Religious ideas--their influence upon the social,\r\n    political, and intellectual movements.\r\n\r\n    \"12. Establishment of a society for mutual help; aid, moral and\r\n    material, given to the orphans of the association.\"\r\n\r\nThis reads more like the agenda of a sophomore debating society than\r\nthe outline of work for an international congress of workingmen. The\r\ndiscussions of the congress were desultory, quite impractical, and\r\noften tinged with the factional spirit that ultimately ruptured the\r\nassociation. At its first meeting the discussion of the eight-hour\r\nday, the limitation of work for women and children, and the\r\nestablishing of better free schools took a modern turn. But the French\r\ndelegates brought forward a proposal to confine the membership in the\r\nassociation to \"hand workers.\" This was to get rid of Marx and Engels,\r\nwho were \"brain workers.\" Socialism was evidently no more clearly\r\ndefined then than it is to-day.\r\n\r\nOccasionally practical subjects were debated, as the acquiring by the\r\nstate of all the means of transportation, of mines, forests, and\r\nland. But their time was largely taken up in the discussion of general\r\nprinciples, such as \"Labor must have its full rights and entire\r\nrewards.\" Or they resolved, as at Brussels in 1868, that producers\r\ncould gain control of machines and factories only through an\r\nindefinite extension of co-operative societies and a system of mutual\r\ncredit; or, as at Basle the following year, that society had a right\r\nto abolish private property in land.\r\n\r\nIt is apparent to any one who reads the reports of their meetings that\r\nvery little practical advance had been made since the \"Manifesto.\"\r\nSocialism was still in the vapor of speculation. It had absorbed some\r\npractical aspects from the English unions. These were at first\r\ninterested in the International, and at their national conference in\r\nSheffield, 1868, they even urged the local unions to join it. This\r\ninterest waned rapidly as they saw the Continental contingent veer\r\ntowards the Commune.\r\n\r\nHowever, the beginnings of a new movement, a \"new Socialism,\" were\r\ndistinctly seen in the questions that the English element introduced:\r\nthe length of the working day, factory legislation, work of women and\r\nchildren. These had been the subject of rigid governmental inquiry.\r\nMarx was thoroughly familiar with these parliamentary findings. They\r\nare no small part of the fortifications he built around his theory of\r\nsocial development. But his German training inclined him to the\r\nContinental, not the Anglo-Saxon, view of social progress and of\r\npolitics.\r\n\r\nThe \"Old International,\" then, was an attempt to spread Marxian\r\ndoctrines into all lands. As such an attempt it is noteworthy. The\r\nMarxian _modus_, however, did not fit the world. Some Socialist\r\nwriters attribute its failure to the fact that the time was not ripe\r\nfor Marx's methods. The time will never be ripe for the Marxian\r\nmethod. Marx tried to move everything from one center. He was a German\r\ndogmatist. His council was a centralized autocracy, issuing mandates\r\nlike a general to an army. This is an impossible method of\r\ninternational organization. The center must be supported by the\r\nperiphery, not the periphery by the center. There could be no\r\nproletarian internationalism until there was an organized proletarian\r\nnationalism.\r\n\r\nIts conceptions of its detailed duties were even cruder than its\r\nmachinery. The discussions were a blending of pedantic declamation and\r\nphosphoric denunciation. Its programs were a mixture of English\r\ntrade-union realities and Continental vagaries. Such a movement had\r\nneither wings nor legs.\r\n\r\nBut it had an influence, nevertheless, and a very important one. It\r\nwas the means of bringing the new generation of leaders together, the\r\nmen who were to make Socialism a practical political force. Even the\r\nfact that an international laboring men's society could meet was\r\nimportant. It realized the central idea of Marx, that the labor\r\nproblem is international. That is the important point. Human\r\nsolidarity is not ethnic, but inter-ethnic. The \"Old International\"\r\nwas a faltering step toward that solidarity of humanity that has been\r\nadvanced so rapidly by inventions, by international arbitrations, by\r\ntreaties of commerce, and every other movement that makes\r\ninternational hostilities every year more difficult.\r\n\r\nOn Socialism the \"International\" had at least one beneficial effect.\r\nIt cleared its atmosphere of the anarchistic thunder clouds and\r\nprepared the way for the present more practical movement. This was\r\nlargely due to the influence of the English trade unions. They were\r\nnot inclined toward philosophical dissertations like the Germans, nor\r\nbrilliant speculative vagaries like the French. Their stolid forms\r\nwere always on the earth. That Marx was anxious for their support is\r\napparent, and he drove them out of the movement by his indiscreet\r\nutterances on the Parisian Commune of 1871.\r\n\r\nThe \"Old International\" was a revival of the \"Society of the Just,\"\r\ntempered with English trade-unionism and tinged with Anarchism; it was\r\nalso a connecting link between the old and the new Socialism.\r\n\r\nThe characteristics of the \"New Socialism\" cropped out at the first\r\nmeeting of the \"New International,\" as it is called. In the first\r\nplace, the co-operative movement and the trade-union movement were\r\nboth amply represented at the Paris meetings, where the \"New\r\nInternational\" was formed in 1889. This is indicative of the new\r\ndirection that the economic phase of Socialism has since taken. In the\r\nsecond place, the Socialist congress split into two parties,\r\nostensibly over the question of the credentials of certain delegates,\r\nbut really over the question that divides Socialists in all countries\r\nto-day: Shall Socialists co-operate with other political parties or\r\nremain isolated? The Marxian dogmatists believed in isolation; the\r\nopportunists or Possibilists believed in co-operating with other\r\nparties. There were two congresses. The Marxian congress had 221\r\nFrench delegates and about 175 from other countries. The Possibilist\r\nconvention was composed of 91 foreign and 521 French delegates. It was\r\nvirtually a labor union convention, for over 225 unions were\r\nrepresented. It is of great significance that these two meetings,\r\nwhich divided on a question of political policy, discussed virtually\r\nthe same questions. They were against war, believed in collectivism,\r\ndemanded international labor legislation, the eight-hour day, the \"day\r\nof rest,\" etc.[8]\r\n\r\nLiebknecht, the distinguished German Socialist, who was one of the\r\nchairmen of the Marxian convention, wrote in his preface to the German\r\nedition of the _Proceedings_ that the Paris meeting began a new era,\r\n\"and indicated a break with the past.\" He told the delegates at the\r\nconvention, \"the Old International lives in us to-day.\" There was a\r\ncontinuity of proletarian ambition. In this respect the old movement\r\nwas resurrected in the new. But in every other respect the old\r\nmovement was dead. The abstractions about property and the rights of\r\nindividuals did not interest the new generation. They were more\r\nconcerned with wages than wage theories, and in the purchasing power\r\nof their wages than in a theory of values. Even the spirit of the\r\nclass consciousness had changed. Marx's organization was the source of\r\nthe old; national consciousness was the source of the new. The\r\npresent internationalism is the result of nationalism. The delegates\r\nat Paris were representatives; they represented nationalities. One of\r\nthe rules of the Marxian congress was that votes should be counted \"by\r\nthe head,\" unless a delegation from any country should unanimously\r\ndemand \"voting by nationalities.\"\r\n\r\nIn the twenty years that had elapsed since Bakunin and his\r\nconspiracy-loving following had disrupted the \"Old International\" by\r\ntheir preaching of violence against nationalism, labor had increased\r\nwith the rapid strides of the increasing industry and commerce of the\r\nworld. This labor had organized itself into unions and all manner of\r\nco-operative and protective associations. It had done this by natural\r\ncompulsion from within, not by a superimposed force from without. They\r\nhad thereby found their national homogeneity, and were ready to go\r\nforward into a great and universal international homogeneity.\r\n\r\nThe International Workingmen's Association now embraces the labor\r\nmovement of all the leading countries of the world. At the last\r\ncongress, held in Copenhagen, 1910, reports were received from the\r\nfollowing organizations: the British Labor Party, the Fabian Society,\r\nthe Social Democratic Federation of England, the Social Democratic\r\nParty of Germany, the Social Democratic Labor Party of Austria, the\r\nCommission of Trade Unions of Austria, the Social Democratic Labor\r\nParty of Bohemia, the Social Democratic Party of Hungary, the\r\nSocialist Party of France, the Socialist Party of Italy, the\r\nRevolutionary Socialist Party of Russia, the Social Democratic Party\r\nof Lettland, the Social Democratic Party of Finland, the Socialist\r\nParty of Norway, the Social Democratic Labor Party of Sweden, the\r\nDanish Social Democracy, the Social Democratic Party of Holland, the\r\nBelgian Labor Party, the Socialist Labor Party of the United States,\r\nthe Social Democratic Party of Servia, and the Bulgarian Laborers'\r\nSocial Democratic Party.[9] These names indicate the threefold nature\r\nof the modern movement. It is a labor movement, it is democratic, and\r\nit is Socialistic. And the list of countries shows that it is\r\ninternational.\r\n\r\nAt Brussels a permanent International Socialist Bureau is maintained,\r\nwith a permanent secretary, who is in constant touch with the movement\r\nin all countries.\r\n\r\nThere are two directions in which this remarkable co-operation of\r\nmillions of workingmen of all lands may have a practical effect on\r\ninternational affairs.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, there is an effort being made to internationalize\r\nlabor unions. In Europe this has been done, to some extent, among the\r\ntransportation workers. They have an international committee of their\r\nown, and keep each other informed of labor conditions and movements.\r\nThe great railway strike in England, in the summer of 1911, was\r\nplanned on the Continent, as well as in London and Liverpool, and\r\nthere was a sympathetic restlessness with the strikers in various\r\ncountries adjacent to the Channel that threatened to break out in\r\nviolence. During the post-office strike in France the strikers\r\nattempted to persuade English and Belgian railway employees to refuse\r\nto handle French mail. The Syndicalists confidently look forward to\r\nthe day when an international labor organization will be able to\r\ncompel a universal general strike.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, the new international organization will have a\r\nfar-reaching influence on militarism. This is due to two causes:\r\nfirst, the recruit himself is filled with the discontent of the\r\nSocialist before he dons the uniform. In France, Germany, Belgium,\r\nAustria, and other countries the anti-military virus has been long at\r\nwork. But more potent than this is the feeling of international\r\nsolidarity that binds these recruits into a brotherhood of labor who\r\nare unwilling to fight each other for purposes that do not appeal to\r\nthe Socialist heart. Warfare, to the laboring man, is merely one phase\r\nof the exploitation of the poor for the benefit of the capitalist, and\r\npatriotism an excuse to hide the real purposes of war. At St. Quentin,\r\nin 1911, the French Socialists denounced the war in Morocco as an\r\nexploitation of human lives for the purposes of capitalistic gain. The\r\nGerman Social Democracy has always opposed the colonial policy of the\r\nchancellors on the same ground, and the Belgian Labor Party has been\r\nthe severest censor of the Belgian Congo campaigns.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1911 the Morocco incident threatened a war\r\nbetween France and Germany, with England involved, and the other great\r\npowers more than interested. In August and September the situation\r\nbecame so acute that England and Germany were popularly said to have\r\nbeen \"within two weeks of war.\" A profound sense of danger and an\r\nintense restlessness possessed the people. During this period of\r\nexcitement the French Socialists held anti-war demonstrations. The\r\nGerman Social Democrats met in their annual convention at Jena and\r\npassed a resolution condemning the German Morocco policy, and Herr\r\nBebel made a notable speech, detailing the horrors of war with grim\r\nexactness, and arraigning a civilization that would resort to the\r\n\"monstrous miseries\" of war for gaining a few acres of land. This\r\nspeech was quoted at length by the great European dailies, and made a\r\ndeep impression upon the people. In England the leaders of the Labor\r\nParty admonished the government that, while they were patriots and\r\nbelieved in national solidarity, the English workingman would never\r\ncease to consider the German and the French workingman as a\r\nfellow-laborer and brother. The International Socialist Bureau met in\r\nZurich to discuss the situation and to consider how the organizations\r\nof labor might make their protests against war most effective.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to measure the influence of such an international\r\nprotest against the powers of governments and of armies. That the\r\nprotest was made, that it was sincere, rational and free from the\r\nhyperbola of passion, is the significant fact. Forty years ago such\r\naction on the part of labor would have been ridiculed. To-day it is\r\nrespected.\r\n\r\nDisarmament, when it comes, will be due to the influences exerted by\r\nthe recruit rather than to the benevolent impulses of governments and\r\ncommanders.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Introduction to _Klassenkaempfe_, p. 13.\r\n\r\n[2] See ENGELS, Introduction to MARX'S _Enthuellungen ueber den\r\nKommunisten Process zu Koeln_.\r\n\r\n[3] Joint-preface of edition of 1872.\r\n\r\n[4] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n[5] See \"Address of the General Council of the Workingmen's\r\nAssociation on the Civil War in France.\"\r\n\r\n[6] Many of the original documents, and extensive excerpts from others\r\nare given in DR.

The caldron\r\nboiled over and put out the fire. Thiers, in his last official message\r\nas president, claimed that Socialism, living and thriving in Germany,\r\nwas absolutely dead in France. It was, however, to be revived in a\r\nnewer and more vital form.\r\n\r\nThe exiled communards, in England and elsewhere, came in contact with\r\nMarxianism, and in 1880, when a general amnesty was declared, they\r\nbrought to Paris a new and virile propaganda. The leader of the new\r\nMarxian movement was Jules Guesde, a tireless zealot, burning with the\r\nfire that kindles enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nThe \"affaire Boulanger\" absorbed attention at this time, and Guesde,\r\nin his newspapers, _La Revolution Francaise_ and _Egalite_, supported\r\nthe Republic. But he was also insisting upon \"Le minimum d'etat et la\r\nmaximum de liberte\" (a minimum of government and a maximum of\r\nliberty). This may be taken as the political maxim of the Socialists\r\nat that time, although it leads them into the embarrassing anomaly of\r\nusing their own slave as their master.\r\n\r\nMeantime a political labor party had arisen. In Paris, in 1878, a\r\nworkingman became a candidate for the municipal council, and he headed\r\nhis program with the words \"_Parti Ouvrier_\"--Labor Party. This is\r\nthe first time the words were used with a political significance.[1]\r\nIt was a small beginning, his votes were few, and the newspaper that\r\nespoused the workingman's cause, _Le Proletaire_, was constantly on\r\nthe verge of bankruptcy for want of proletarian support. In other\r\ncities the political labor movement began, and in 1879 a labor\r\nconference was held in Marseilles.\r\n\r\nThe two movements, labor and Socialist, drew together in 1880 at a\r\ngeneral conference of workingmen at Havre. Here there were three\r\ngroups which found it impossible to coalesce: the Anarchists, under\r\nBlanqui, formed the \"Parti Socialiste Revolutionnaire\"--the\r\nRevolutionary Socialist Party; the co-operativists, calling themselves\r\nthe Republican Socialist Alliance, included the opportunist element of\r\nthe Socialists; and the Guesdists, who were in the majority, organized\r\nthe \"Parti Ouvrier Francais\"--the French Labor Party--and adopted a\r\nMarxian program.\r\n\r\nThe Guesdists entered the campaign with characteristic zeal. They\r\npolled only 15,000 votes in Paris and 25,000 in the Departments for\r\ntheir municipal tickets, and 50,000 in the entire country for their\r\nlegislative ticket.\r\n\r\nFrom the first the Socialists in France have been rent by petty\r\nfactions. We will hastily review these constantly shifting groups\r\nbefore proceeding to the larger inquiry.\r\n\r\nIn 1882 the Guesdists split, and Brousse formed the \"Federation des\r\nTravailleurs Socialistes de France\"--the Federation of Socialist\r\nWorkingmen of France. In 1885 Malon formed a group for the study of\r\nthe social problems, \"Societe d'Economie Sociale\"--Society of Social\r\nEconomics--which rapidly developed into the important group of\r\nIndependent Socialists--\"Parti Socialiste Independent.\" The labor\r\nmovement was stimulated by the act of 1884, and in 1886 the\r\n\"Federation des Syndicats\"--Federation of Labor Unions--was organized\r\nat Lyons, and in 1887 the Paris Labor Exchange--\"Bourse du\r\nTravail\"--was opened.\r\n\r\nIn 1882 Allemane seceded from the Broussists to found a faction of his\r\nown, the Revolutionary Socialist Labor Party of France--\"Parti Ouvrier\r\nSocialiste Revolutionnaire Francais.\" In 1893 the first confederation\r\nof the labor exchanges (bourses) was held, and the first conspicuous\r\nvictory at the polls achieved.\r\n\r\nIn 1899 an effort was made to unify the warring factions, and a\r\ncommittee representing every shade of Socialistic faith was appointed.\r\nIt was called the General Committee--\"Comite General Socialiste.\"\r\nWithin the year the Guesdists withdrew on account of the rigorous\r\nquelling of the strike riots by the government at Chalons-sur-Saone.\r\nIn 1901 the Blanquists withdrew and, coalescing with the Guesdists,\r\nformed the Socialist Party of France--\"Parti Socialiste de France.\"\r\nThis movement was soon followed by the uniting of the Jauresites and\r\nthe Independents, who called themselves the French Socialist\r\nParty--\"Parti Socialiste Francais.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the expulsion of Millerand, the two parties united in 1905 at\r\nRouen. This unity was achieved at the suggestion of the International\r\nCongress held at Amsterdam, 1904. The \"United Party\" is officially\r\nknown as the French Section of the International Workingmen's\r\nAssociation--\"Section Francaise de l'Internationale Ouvriere.\"\r\n\r\nThe United Party, after its years of ridiculous factionalism, is the\r\nmost compact and disciplined group in the Chamber of Deputies, and\r\nthis in spite of the fact that the Guesdists and Jauresites have not\r\nforgotten their ancient differences. The French people are not\r\namenable to discipline and party rigor as are the Germans and the\r\nAnglo-Saxons. At the last election (1910) the United Party elected 76\r\ndeputies in a chamber of 590 members.\r\n\r\nThere are to-day two other groups that are more or less Socialistic\r\nbut are not in \"the Party.\" The Independent Socialists, numbering\r\nthirty-four members in the Chamber, are men who, either because of\r\ntheir intellectualism or because of their political ambitions, have a\r\nrepugnance to hard and fast organization. This group includes a number\r\nof college professors and journalists; also Briand, Viviani, and\r\nMillerand, former ministers. They are not committed to any definite\r\npolitical program, take a leading part in all social reform measures,\r\nand are accused by the \"united ones\" of using the name Socialist\r\nmerely as a bait for votes.\r\n\r\nThe other group is the Socialist-Radical Party, numbering about 250\r\nmembers in the Chamber. In most countries their radicalism would be\r\ncalled Socialism. But in France they are only the connecting link\r\nbetween Socialists and liberal Republicans.[2]\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe \"social questions\" were slow in entering parliament. In 1876 a\r\nBonapartist deputy, known for his charities, interpolated the\r\ngovernment, asking what inquiries were being made toward securing the\r\nmoral and material betterment of \"the greatest number,\" and amidst the\r\ncheers of his followers the Prime Minister replied that the\r\ngovernment's duty was comprehended in securing to the country\r\n\"liberty, security, and education.\" This was the old idea of the\r\nfunctions of government. The new social movement had not yet gathered\r\nmomentum.\r\n\r\nWith the development of the workingman's political party, interest and\r\nsympathy for his problems suddenly increased. In 1880 the Republicans\r\nadopted a resolution in favor of freedom of association. At this time\r\nlabor unions were illegal. In 1881 the government removed the\r\nrestrictions that had been placed on the press. In the following year\r\nit extended the primary schools into every commune, and Gambetta did\r\neverything in his power to promulgate what he termed \"an alliance of\r\nthe proletariat and the bourgeois.\" Social science, he said, was the\r\nsolvent of social ills. The Socialists, however, believed that\r\npolitics, not \"social science,\" was the solvent.\r\n\r\nIt was not until 1884, while Waldeck-Rousseau was Minister of the\r\nInterior, that labor was given the legal right to organize.\r\nImmediately unions--called _syndicats_ by the French--sprang up\r\neverywhere. Article 3 of the act declared that these unions had for\r\ntheir exclusive object \"the study and the promulgation of their\r\ninterests, economic, industrial, commercial, and agricultural.\" They\r\nwere not given the liberal legal powers that English and American\r\nunions have.\r\n\r\nThe social movement now invaded French politics in full battle array.\r\nA government commission was intrusted with the study of the\r\nco-operative movement. In 1885 several deputies, calling themselves\r\nSocialists, began to interpellate the ministry on the labor questions.\r\nThe government brought in two proposals, one pertaining to communal\r\nand industrial organizations, the other to the arbitration of\r\nindustrial disputes. Both were tabled.\r\n\r\nIn 1887 a man appeared in the Chamber ready to debate the social\r\nquestions with the keenest and the ablest. This was Jean Jaures, a\r\nprofessor of philosophy, whose profound knowledge and superb oratory\r\nimmediately commanded attention. He was joined by another new deputy,\r\nM. Millerand, scarcely less proficient in debate, and even more\r\nextreme in his convictions. Both were considered members of the\r\nradical party. But they soon formed the nucleus of a new group, the\r\nIndependent Socialists, that grew rapidly in influence and power.\r\n\r\nThe social question was forced on the public from yet another\r\ndirection. The Anarchists, who had been expelled from the Havre\r\nconference, remained passive until the organization of trade unions.\r\nThey then began to promulgate the doctrine of the general strike. The\r\nunionists began not only to compel their employers to accede to their\r\ndemands, but to coerce workingmen to join the unions. It was during\r\nthis agitation that the government established an elaborate system of\r\nlabor exchanges--\"Bourse du Travail.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the labor unions the doctrine of the general strike was\r\ninsinuated into Socialist circles. In 1890 it was proposed as a\r\npractical measure for enforcing the demand for an eight-hour day among\r\nthe miners. In 1892 the Departmental Congress of Workingmen at Tours\r\npassed a resolution favoring the general strike, and it was discussed\r\na few days later in a general convention of the unions, at the\r\nsuggestion of Aristide Briand, a Socialist who was destined to play an\r\nimportant role in the development of the theory and practice of\r\ngeneral strikes.\r\n\r\nThe government could no longer dodge the social question. Millerand\r\nannounced his conversion to Socialism and became the leader of a small\r\nparliamentary coterie who pressed the issue daily. In a signed\r\nstatement to the unions they said: \"The Republic has given the ballot\r\ninto your hand, now give the Republic your instructions.\"[3] The\r\nparliamentary _entente_ of the liberal Socialists with the Radical\r\nLeft dates from this time. The campaign spread with surprising fervor.\r\nLabor unions and parliamentary Socialists joined their forces. In 1893\r\nthey elected forty Socialists to the Chamber of Deputies. Among them\r\nwere Jaures, who now espoused the cause of the Socialist opportunists;\r\nMillerand, conspicuous as leader of the independent group; Guesde, the\r\nvehement Marxian; and Vaillant, a communard and Socialist of the older\r\ntype.\r\n\r\nNow began the actual parliamentary Socialism in France. Jaures, in\r\nintroducing the group--they were scarcely a party--to the Chamber,\r\naffirmed their allegiance to the Republic and their devotion to the\r\ncause of humanity. The misery of the people had awakened, he said,\r\nafter right of association had been granted. Labor had, through\r\nstrikes, gained certain minor improvements. It was now prepared to\r\nconquer public authority. But so much of their time was spent in\r\nquarreling with each other, and debating whether they should vote with\r\nthe Radicals, that very little substantial work was accomplished by\r\nthe Socialists.\r\n\r\nFinally, encouraged by their unusual success in the municipal\r\nelections of 1896, the leaders of the various factions met at\r\nSaint-Mande to celebrate their victory. They were tiring of their\r\nquarrels and were ready to unite. At least they agreed that each group\r\ncould name its own candidate for the first ballot; on the second\r\nballot they should all support the Socialist who polled the most votes\r\non the first ballot.[4]\r\n\r\nBut who is a Socialist? Here for the first time a political definition\r\nwas attempted. Millerand, a Parisian lawyer who, we have seen, made\r\nhis political debut with Jaures, as a member of the Radical Left,\r\nattempted the answer. It was made in the presence of Guesde, Vaillant,\r\nand Jaures, and many local leaders from various parts of France. So,\r\nfor the moment and for the occasion of rejoicing, there was a united\r\nSocialism. And it gave assent, with varying enthusiasm, to the general\r\ndefinition and program outlined by Millerand. He defined the ground to\r\nbe covered as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Is not the Socialistic idea completely summed up in the earnest\r\ndesire to secure for every being in the bosom of society the\r\nunimpaired development of his personality? That implies two necessary\r\nconditions of which one is a factor of the other: first, individual\r\nappropriation of things necessary for the security and development of\r\nthe individual, i.e., property; secondly, liberty, which is only a\r\nsounding and hollow word if it is not based on and safeguarded by\r\nproperty.\"\r\n\r\nHe then accepted _in toto_ the Marxian theory that capitalistic\r\nsociety bears within itself the enginery of its own doom. \"Men do not\r\nand will not set up collectivism; it is setting itself up daily; it\r\nis, if I may be allowed the phrase, being secreted by the capitalistic\r\nregime. Here I seem to have my finger on the characteristic feature of\r\nthe Socialist program. In my view, whoever does not admit the\r\nnecessary and progressive replacement of capitalistic property by\r\nsocial property is not a Socialist.\"\r\n\r\nMillerand was not satisfied with merely including banking, railroads,\r\nand mining in the list of \"socialized\" property. He believed that as\r\nindustries become \"ripe\" they should be taken over by the state, and\r\ncites sugar refining as an example of a monopoly that is\r\n\"incontestably ripe.\" Millerand also laid great stress on municipal\r\nactivities, and hastened to guarantee to the small property owner his\r\nmodest possessions. All this taking over by the state was to be done\r\ngradually. \"No Socialist ever dreamed of transforming the capitalistic\r\nregime instantaneously by magic wand.\" The method of this gradual\r\nabsorption by the state must be constitutional. \"We appeal only to\r\nuniversal suffrage. To realize the immediate reforms capable of\r\nrelieving the lot of the working class, and thus fitting it to win its\r\nown freedom, and to begin, as conditioned by the nature of things, the\r\nsocialization of the means of production, it is necessary and\r\nsufficient for the Socialist party to endeavor to capture the\r\ngovernment through universal suffrage.\"[5]\r\n\r\nThis mild formulary, which places the \"socialized society\" far into\r\nthe dim future, was accepted as long as it was rhetorical. But when\r\nMillerand himself became a member of the cabinet in the\r\nWaldeck-Rousseau coalition, and began to translate his words into\r\ndeeds, a rupture followed.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime occurred the Dreyfus affair, which shifted all the\r\npolitical forces of the Republic. At first the Guesdists remained\r\nindifferent, while Jaures, with great energy, threw himself into the\r\ncontest in behalf of Dreyfus. But when the affair took an\r\nanti-Republican turn and democracy was threatened, then all the\r\nSocialists united, with no lack of energy and zeal, in the defense of\r\nthe Republic. On June 13, 1898, Millerand was spokesman in the Chamber\r\nof Deputies for the Socialist group, which now held the balance of\r\npower. With threats of violence against the Republic in the air, he\r\nassured the deputies that his comrades were united for \"the honor, the\r\nsplendor, and the safety of the Fatherland\" (l'honneur, la grandeur,\r\net la securite de la Patrie). And this was part of the price of their\r\nadhesion: old-age pensions, a fixed eight-hour day, factory\r\nlegislation protecting the life and health of the workman, military\r\nservice reduced to two years, and an income tax. The Radical Left\r\nadopted this \"minimum program\" of the Socialists, and the famous\r\n\"Bloc\" was formed. Jaures was made vice-president of the Chamber and\r\nsoon proved himself master of the coalition. Now for the first time in\r\nhistory the Socialists were in political power, and what occurred is\r\nof the greatest interest to us.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nAnd now for the first time a Socialist becomes a cabinet member. In\r\n1899 Waldeck-Rousseau appointed Millerand Minister of Commerce, to the\r\nconsternation of the Conservatives and the division of the Socialists.\r\nJaures congratulated his colleague on his courage in assuming\r\nresponsibility. But while the Independents were jubilant over the\r\nelevation of one of their number, the Guesdists and Blanquists withdrew\r\nfrom the \"Bloc.\" They issued a manifesto setting forth their reasons.\r\nThey did not wish further alliances with a \"pretended Socialist.\" They\r\nwere tired of \"compromises and deviations,\" which for too long a time\r\nhad been forced on them as \"a substitute for the class war, for\r\nrevolution, and the socialism of the militant proletariat.\"[6]\r\n\r\nTo them the war of the classes forbade their entrance into a bourgeois\r\nministry; and the conquest of political power did not imply\r\ncollaboration with a government whose duty it was to defend property.\r\nJaures proposed to put the question up to the party congress, and in\r\n1899 at Paris a bilateral compromise resolution was adopted. Guesde,\r\nhowever, restless and dissatisfied, compelled the congress to vote\r\nfirst upon the question, \"Does the war of the classes permit the\r\nentrance of a Socialist into a bourgeois government?\" The answer was\r\n818 \"no,\" 634 \"yes.\" Jaures' compromise was then adopted, 1,140 to\r\n240.[7]\r\n\r\nThe international congress held in Paris, September, 1900, adopted\r\nKautsky's resolution declaring that the acceptance of office by a\r\nsingle Socialist in a bourgeois government \"could not be deemed the\r\nnormal commencement of the conquest for political power, but only an\r\nexpedient called forth by transitory and exceptional conditions.\"\r\n\r\nAt the Bordeaux congress, April, 1903, the whole time was given over\r\nto this perplexing question. The congress was composed largely of\r\nfriends of Millerand and Jaures. By this time the Socialist minister\r\nhad had three years' experience in the cabinet. The Waldeck-Rousseau\r\npremiership had given way to Combes, who was also dependent upon the\r\nSocialists for his power.\r\n\r\nMillerand had especially offended the Socialists by voting against his\r\nparty on three separate occasions: first, on a resolution abolishing\r\nstate support for public worship; second, on a resolution to prosecute\r\ncertain anti-militarists for publishing a book that tended to destroy\r\nmilitary discipline; and, third, on a resolution asking the Minister\r\nof Foreign Affairs to invite proposals for international disarmament.\r\nHe had further offended the Socialists by officially receiving the\r\nCzar on his visit to Paris.\r\n\r\nThe debate, then, was disciplinary rather than doctrinal. But it was\r\npolitical discipline, evidence therefore that a party consciousness of\r\nsome sort had been achieved. This meeting is significant because it\r\ntried to fix definite limits for Socialistic action and committed\r\nJaures to the narrowing, not to the expanding, policy of the party.\r\n\r\nM. Sarrante expressed the Millerand idea when he told the delegates\r\nthat they were to judge \"an entire policy,\" the policy of \"democratic\r\nSocialism, which gains ground daily on the revolutionary Socialism, a\r\npolicy which Citizen Millerand did not start, which he has merely\r\ndeveloped and defined, and which forces itself upon us more and more\r\nin our republican country.\" The test of Socialism, he said, was just\r\nthis \"contact of theory with facts.\"\r\n\r\nJaures found himself in logical difficulty when he endeavored to\r\nreconcile both sides for the sake of party unity. He said that\r\nSarrante was wrong \"when he thinks it enough to lay down the principle\r\nof democracy in order to resolve, in a sort of automatic fashion, the\r\nantagonisms of society.... The enthronement of political democracy and\r\nuniversal suffrage by no means suppresses the profound antagonism of\r\nclasses.... Sarrante errs in positing democracy without noting that it\r\nis modified, adulterated, thwarted by the antagonism of classes and\r\nthe economic preponderance of one class. Just as Guesde errs in\r\npositing the class war apart from democracy.\"\r\n\r\nTo Jaures the problem was to \"penetrate\" this democracy with the ideas\r\nof Socialism until the \"proletarian and Socialistic state has replaced\r\nthe oligarchic and bourgeois state.\" This can be brought about, he\r\nsaid, by \"a policy which consists in at once collaborating with all\r\ndemocrats, yet vigorously distinguishing one's self from them.\"\r\n\r\nJaures acknowledged the awkwardness of this policy, which required a\r\nsuperhuman legerdemain never yet accomplished by any party in the\r\nhistory of politics.\r\n\r\nGuesde's motion to oust Millerand from the party was lost. And a\r\ncompromise offered by Jaures censuring him for his votes, but\r\npermitting him to remain in the party fold, was adopted by 109 to 89\r\nvotes, fifteen delegates abstaining from voting. This was a very close\r\nmargin, and in spite of Millerand's promise that he would in the\r\nfuture be more careful of his party allegiance he was expelled the\r\nfollowing year from the Federation of the Seine. The stumbling-block\r\nwas removed.[8]\r\n\r\nMore important than the party discipline is the question of the\r\neconomic measures attempted by Millerand. In general he followed the\r\noutlines laid down in his Saint-Mande program.[9] His experience\r\ncarried him farther away from the Guesdists every year until he\r\nrepudiated the class war and adhered to social solidarity; substituted\r\nthe method by evolution for the method by revolution, still espoused\r\nby Guesde; and placed the national interests upon as high a plane of\r\nduty as the international and the personal. His program of labor\r\nlegislation was comprehensive, and he succeeded in getting some of it\r\npassed into law. These were his leading proposals:\r\n\r\n1. Regulating the hours of labor and creating a normal working day of\r\nten hours. He began the reduction at eleven hours, reducing it to ten\r\nand a half, and then to ten within three years. In the public works of\r\nhis own department he reduced the working day at once to eight hours.\r\n\r\n2. In public contracts he introduced clauses favorable to workingmen.\r\nThese clauses embraced the number of hours in a normal work day, the\r\nminimum wage for every class of workmen, prohibition of piece-work,\r\nguarantee of no work on Sunday, and the per cent. of foreign workmen\r\nallowed on the job. He arranged that the workingmen should unite with\r\nthe employer in fixing the wages and the hours of labor before the\r\ncontract was signed. In these contracts, furthermore, the state\r\nreserved the right to indemnify the workmen out of the funds due to\r\nthe contractor.\r\n\r\n3. An accident insurance law.\r\n\r\n4. The abolition of private employment agencies, with their many\r\nabuses, and replacing them with communal labor bureaus free to all.\r\nThe voluntary federations of the trade unions were put on a similar\r\nfooting with the communal labor exchanges, and were encouraged to\r\nco-operate with them. Millerand took great care to perfect the\r\norganization of trade unions. He introduced amendments to the old law\r\nof 1884, giving greater scope and elasticity to the unions, granting\r\nthem greater corporate powers, and making the dismissal of a workman\r\nbecause he belonged to a union ground for a civil suit for damages. He\r\nbegan a movement to secure the co-operation between the unions and the\r\nstate workshop inspectors. There had been a great deal of abuse in the\r\noperation of the inspection laws by the employers. An attempt was now\r\nmade to define strictly the rights and duties of the inspectors.\r\n\r\n5. His pet scheme was the establishing of labor councils (conseils du\r\ntravail). On these councils labor and employer were to have equal\r\nrepresentation. The duty of the councils embraced the adjudication of\r\nall disputes arising between employer and employee, suggesting\r\nimprovements, and keeping vigilance over all local labor conditions.\r\nIn 1891 a supreme labor council had been established. To this\r\nMillerand added lay and official members and greatly increased its\r\nefficiency. He tried to make it a central vigilance bureau, keeping in\r\nclose touch with local conditions all over the land.\r\n\r\n6. He elaborated a plan for regulating industrial disputes. This was\r\nto be effected by a permanent organization in each establishment\r\nemploying more than fifty men, a sort of committee of grievance to\r\nwhich all matters of dispute might be referred. In case of failure to\r\nsettle their difficulties an appeal to the local labor council was\r\nprovided. By this democratic representative machinery Millerand hoped\r\nto solve the labor problem.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that Millerand's plan was an attempt, by law, to\r\nproject the working class, not into politics but into the capitalist\r\nclass. He would do this by compelling the employer to share the\r\nresponsibility of ownership with his employees. This would mark the\r\nbeginning of a revolution very different from the revolution\r\nordinarily preached by propagandists, because this revolution would\r\nsubstitute class peace in place of our present incessant economic\r\nclass war.\r\n\r\nThe Socialists made it plain that Millerand's procedure was not\r\nSocialism. When Millerand was first asked to take a cabinet portfolio\r\nhis friend Jaures told him to accept. When he had perfected his\r\npractical procedure, and the bulk of the proletarians evinced their\r\ndisappointment and chagrin that the elevation of a Socialist had not\r\nbrought utopia, Jaures gradually slipped away from his former alliance\r\nand finally left the reformist group.\r\n\r\nJaures also had his day of power. The Dreyfus affair presented the\r\nissue in tangible form--the old traditions, religious, political,\r\nsocial, against the new ideas of society, property, and government. It\r\nwas the heroic period of modern French Socialism. Red and black flags\r\nwere borne by enthusiastic multitudes through the streets of Paris.\r\nThe \"_Universite Populaire_\" was inaugurated by students for the\r\npurpose of instructing the common people in the issues that were at\r\nstake. The flame of eager anticipation spread over the Republic.\r\n\r\nAs master of the \"Bloc\" in the Chamber, Jaures became the first real\r\nhead in the first French democracy. Two great reforms were undertaken:\r\nthe disestablishment of the Church, carrying with it the\r\nsecularization of education and the reorganization of the army. The\r\nold Royalist families had continued to send their sons into the army\r\nand navy. Many of the officers were suspected of royalist sympathies.\r\nAn elaborate system of espionage was instituted, and the suspects\r\nweeded out. The last vestige of the old monarchy has now disappeared\r\nfrom French officialdom. France has a bourgeois army, a bourgeois\r\nschool system, a bourgeois bureaucracy, thanks to the power of the\r\nproletarian Socialists led by Jaures in the days of the Republic's\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nJaures remained orthodox; Millerand became heretic. The Millerand\r\nepisode left a deep impression on the public mind. The first Socialist\r\nminister shaped not only a program but an entire policy. In 1906, when\r\na new cabinet was formed, Millerand declined a portfolio, but two\r\nother Socialists accepted cabinet honors; Viviani, a well-known\r\nParisian lawyer, held the newly created ministry of labor and social\r\nprevision (prevoyance sociale), and Aristide Briand became Minister of\r\nPublic Instruction and Worship, and later Minister of Justice.\r\n\r\nThe public regarded the elevation of two Socialists to the cabinet as\r\na matter of course. Millerand's activity had taken the fear out of\r\ntheir hearts. Even the Marxian Socialists failed to notice the event.\r\nThey had written into their party by-laws that no Socialist could\r\naccept office, so the new ministers, by their own acts, ceased to be\r\n\"Socialists.\"\r\n\r\nClemenceau, the new Premier, ushered in the next period of social\r\nadventure by a brilliant debate in the Chamber with Jaures in which\r\nthe philosophical basis of individualism was reviewed with great skill\r\nand some of the social questions discussed.[10]\r\n\r\nJaures claimed for the Socialists a dominant share in the great\r\nvictory won by the friends of the Republic during the Dreyfus turmoil,\r\nand made much of the multitudes of workingmen to whom the Republic was\r\nnow under great obligation. These workingmen, the proletariat, were\r\nthe force now to be dealt with. \"If you really wish society to evolve,\r\nif you wish it really to be transformed, there is the force you must\r\ndeal with, and that you must neither repress nor rebuff.\" The\r\nparliamentary experience of Socialism Jaures passed over lightly; it\r\nadded nothing new, he thought, to the theory or the arguments of the\r\nSocialists.\r\n\r\nHis opponent, however, in a single sentence laid bare the weakness of\r\nthe Socialist's logic: \"The truth is that it is necessary to\r\ndistinguish between two different elements of the social organization,\r\nbetween the man and the system.\" Clemenceau read the Socialists'\r\nprogram upon which they had won their victory. It embraced: the\r\neight-hour day, giving state employees the right to form unions,\r\nsickness and unemployment insurance; a progressive income tax; ballot\r\nreform (scrutin de liste) and proportional representation, and\r\n\"restoration to the nation of the monopolies in which capital has its\r\nstrongest fortress.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a terribly bourgeois program!\" exclaimed Clemenceau. \"M. Jaures,\r\nafter expounding his program, challenged me to produce my own. I had\r\nvery great difficulty in restraining the temptation to reply: 'You\r\nknow my program very well. You have it in your pocket. You stole it\r\nfrom me.'\"\r\n\r\nThis debate was significant, not in what was said, but in the fact\r\nthat it was possible to enlist the Prime Minister, the cleverest of\r\nFrench statesmen, and Jaures, the greatest of French orators, in a\r\ndiscussion of Socialism from the tribune of the Chamber of Deputies.\r\nThe whole country listened. During this brilliant tilt Clemenceau\r\ntaunted Jaures that his Socialism was impractical, a dream. \"You are a\r\nvisionary, I am a realist; you have dreams, I have facts.\" Jaures\r\nreplied with great fervor that he would prove to the people of France\r\nthat Socialism is not impracticable and that within a year he would\r\nproduce a plan for the new social order. The \"Unified\" Socialist\r\nParty, built up largely on Jaures' abandonment of his former colleague\r\nand his earlier liberal convictions, may be considered a part of the\r\nfulfilment of this promise. The other part, the plans and\r\nspecifications for the new society, is not yet before the world. Its\r\nintroduction, properly its prelude, is the volume published by Jaures\r\nin 1911, _L'Armee Nouvelle_, containing suggestions for reorganizing\r\nthe state defense along lines of voluntary militia and cadets.[11]\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nClemenceau's regime was destined to test the Socialist policy in a new\r\ndirection. The law of 1884 gave state employees the right to form\r\nassociations, but not to federate or organize _syndicats_. A great\r\nmany organizations were formed, especially among the postal employees\r\nand teachers. They were mutual benefit societies, \"friendly\"\r\nassociations, and the government recognized them to the extent of\r\ndiscussing their grievances and questions of mutual interest with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAmong the workmen in the navy yards and the national match, tobacco,\r\nand porcelain works similar organizations existed. The Syndicalists\r\nwould not let the matter rest there. They demanded that these\r\norganizations become members of the C.G.T. (General Confederation of\r\nWorkingmen). The government objected because that would give the men\r\nthe right to strike, a dangerous anomaly giving to the state's\r\nservants the right to make government nugatory. This extreme doctrine\r\nfound ready advocates in the Chamber among the Socialists.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1909, the post-office clerks and telegraph operators went\r\nout on strike. The government promptly discharged thirty-eight of the\r\nringleaders and arrested eight of the strikers in Paris on the charge\r\nof resisting the police. In the course of a few days over 800 out of\r\n15,000 employees were discharged. Soldiers were introduced into the\r\nservice, and with the help of local chambers of commerce and other\r\ncivic bodies the postal service was renewed. The strikers were then\r\nwilling to make terms. They stipulated that the dismissed employees be\r\nreinstated and that M. Simyan, the Under-Secretary of Posts and\r\nTelegraphs, be dismissed. The first request was conceded, the second\r\nwas denied. The ostensible cause of the strike had been the attitude\r\nof the under-secretary; the men asserted that he was arbitrary and had\r\nimposed petty political exactions upon them. The government refused to\r\nallow the men to dictate its affairs, the under-secretary remained,\r\nand the men went back to work.\r\n\r\nThe Socialists censured the government for not being considerate with\r\nthe men, and placed the entire blame upon the ministry for refusing\r\nthe national employees a right to organize as other workmen. To this\r\nSimyan replied: \"We are in the presence of an organized revolutionary\r\nagitation ... this is blackmail by strike.\" The Minister of Public\r\nWorks said: \"Over our heads these officials have revolted against you\r\nand against the entire nation. These are serious hours when the\r\ngovernment needs perfect facilities of communication with its\r\nambassadors and consuls [the Balkan question was in the pot], and in\r\nsuch hours a strike is an attack upon the national sovereignty. In\r\nthese circumstances I cannot re-enter into negotiations with the\r\ngeneral postal association. If I did so that would mean\r\nabdication.\"[12] The Socialist deputies voted against the government's\r\nresolution \"not to tolerate strikes of functionaries.\"\r\n\r\nThe general strike committee was not discharged when the men returned\r\nto work. When it became evident that the government did not intend to\r\nask the under-secretary for his resignation the post-office employees\r\norganized a trade union, unauthorized by law. The government refused\r\nto meet representatives of this union, on the ground that state\r\nemployees had organized for one purpose only, namely, to have the\r\nright to strike, and the government would not concede that right.\r\n\r\nOn May 12 a second general post-office strike was called. The\r\ngovernment immediately dismissed over two hundred of the strikers. The\r\nSocialists in the Chamber began a demonstration against the\r\ngovernment. One of their number started the \"Internationale,\" the\r\nSocialist war-song. After the first blush of indignation had passed,\r\nthe whole Chamber sprang to its feet, there were shouts of protest, a\r\nRepublican started the Marseillaise, and the two revolutionary hymns,\r\nbourgeois and proletarian, were blended for the first time in a\r\nparliamentary chamber.\r\n\r\nNow the general confederation of labor (C.G.T.) took charge of the\r\nstrike, and soon plots began to be carried out in various parts of the\r\ncountry. There were indications of violence everywhere. The general\r\ncommittee of the C.G.T. declared a general strike. The situation\r\nthreatened to become serious, but the soldiers distributed over the\r\naffected territory had a tranquilizing effect. Men in other trades\r\nwere reluctant to follow the orders of the committee. A few electric\r\nworkers succeeded in cutting some wires in Paris, leaving the city in\r\ndarkness a few hours. There were desultory acts of _sabotage_, but\r\nthere was more terror than enthusiasm, and in two days the general\r\nstrike was over.[13]\r\n\r\nHere was an attempt to place the 800,000 French state employees into\r\nthe revolutionary current of the C.G.T. The real question at issue was\r\nthis: Is striking an act of mutiny? Barthou, a member of the ministry,\r\nsaid in the Chamber of Deputies that \"the more solemnly you denounce\r\nthe strike as a crime against the state, the greater the victory of\r\nthe Syndicalists.\" The Syndicalist journal, _Le Voix du Peuple_, the\r\nday after the first strike was settled proclaimed \"the victory which\r\nour comrades of the postal proletariat have won over their employer\r\nthe state.\" This, they said, showed that the state conceded the main\r\ncontention of Syndicalism--that it is not different from a private\r\nemployer. And the Syndicalists gloried in the fact that the\r\ngovernment, instead of treating the strikers as mutineers, parleyed\r\nwith them and reinstated them.\r\n\r\nClemenceau brought in a bill designed to relieve the situation by\r\nfixing the status of the state employees. The men were to be given the\r\nright of association for \"professional\" purposes only,--i.e., for\r\nimproving their efficiency,--but were absolutely prohibited from\r\nstriking and from joining other unions. A comprehensive civil-service\r\nreform was embodied in the bill, aimed to prevent the men from\r\nbecoming victims of political abuse.\r\n\r\nBefore the bill could be thoroughly considered the Clemenceau ministry\r\nfell and a new Prime Minister was called to the helm. This was none\r\nother than Aristide Briand, the first Socialist Prime Minister in\r\nEuropean history. His former comrades had long before this disowned\r\nhim, and he was soon to participate in events that would forever\r\nalienate them. He had been a furious Socialist, an anti-militarist,\r\nand defender of the general strike. In the Socialist congress at\r\nParis, 1899, he said: \"The general strike has the seductive advantage\r\nthat it is nothing but the practice of an intangible right. It is a\r\nrevolution which arises within the law. The workingman refuses to\r\ncarry the yoke of misery any farther and begins the revolution in the\r\nfield of his legal rights. The illegality must begin with the\r\ncapitalist class, if it allows itself to be provoked into destroying a\r\nright which they themselves have professed to be holy.\" At the same\r\nmeeting he expressed himself on the soldiery as follows: \"If the\r\ncommand to fire is given, if the officers are stubborn enough to try\r\nto force the soldiers against their will, then the guns might be\r\nfired, but perhaps not in the direction the officers thought.\" Briand\r\nrepeated these sentiments at the Amsterdam congress in 1903.\r\n\r\nThis was the man whom destiny had chosen to lead the French government\r\nagainst the organized revolt of government employees.\r\n\r\nOn assuming the premiership he announced his program:\r\n\r\n1. Parliamentary and electoral reform, he said, were of the first\r\nnecessity, but he deemed it best to experiment with the new methods of\r\nballoting locally before adopting a national system of reform.\r\n\r\n2. A graduated income tax.\r\n\r\n3. Fixing the legal status of state servants.\r\n\r\n4. Old-age pension.\r\n\r\nOctober 10, 1910, the men employed on the Northern Railway went out on\r\nstrike. Before they did so they had a conference with the Prime\r\nMinister and the Minister of Public Works, Millerand, requesting that\r\nthey try to arrange a meeting between the men and the officials of the\r\nrailway. The ministry offered its services to the railway directors,\r\nbut they refused to meet the strikers, although Briand had volunteered\r\nto preside at such a meeting. The Prime Minister told the men firmly\r\nthat the government could not tolerate a suspension of railway\r\nservice, that it would exert its authority to prevent it, and that it\r\nrelied on the common sense and patriotism of the men to prevent it.\r\n\r\nHowever, the strike spread to other lines, including the state\r\nrailway. The men's demands were three: 1. A minimum wage of five\r\nfrancs a day. 2. A revision of the railway pension act making the\r\npensions retroactive. 3. A weekly day of rest--the men had been\r\nexcluded from the \"rest day\" act when it was passed.\r\n\r\nBriand at once characterized the strike as political in motive and\r\nrevolutionary in character. In his mind the strike ceased to be merely\r\na question of the right to strike, but was a criminal outbreak, an act\r\nof rebellion planned by a few revolutionary leaders and submitted to\r\nby the rank and file without their even voting on the question. He was\r\ngreatly incensed at the sudden calling out of the men after the\r\ngovernment had received their representatives, and especially since\r\nthe railway companies had granted their request for a minimum wage and\r\nhad taken under advisement the other demands of the men.\r\n\r\nFive of the ringleaders were promptly arrested under dramatic\r\ncircumstances. They were attending a meeting in the office of\r\n_L'Humanite_,[14] attended by Jaures and Vaillant and other leaders of\r\nthe party. They were arrested under color of Sections 17 and 18 of the\r\nlaw of 1845 dealing with railway traffic.[15]\r\n\r\nThis law proved a powerful factor in checking the strike. Arrests were\r\nmade far and near. The energetic Prime Minister did not wait for acts\r\nof violence; he anticipated them. Briand called out the reserves\r\n(militia), and nearly all of the strikers were compelled to put on the\r\nuniform. If they refused they were guilty of a serious offense; if\r\nthey obeyed they could no longer strike.\r\n\r\nThe railways were run as in times of war, under military rigor. In\r\nspite of these precautions acts of violence occurred, and _sabotage_\r\nwas reported from various railway centers.[16]\r\n\r\nIn one week the soldiery, under the determined minister, had done its\r\nwork. The strike was over. The government refused to reinstate about\r\n2,000 men employed on the state railway.\r\n\r\nThe strike committee issued a manifesto excusing the failure of the\r\nstrike, assuming the full responsibility for calling it, and affirming\r\nthat the government had \"lowered itself to the level of the most\r\nbarbarous employer.\"\r\n\r\nThe strike was hastily conceived, never had the sympathy of the\r\npublic, and the destruction of property was deplored even by the labor\r\nunions, which, when it was all over, passed resolutions condemning\r\n_sabotage_. The leaders of the Syndicalists, the plotters of the\r\nstrike, no doubt believed that the time was opportune. The Prime\r\nMinister and two of his cabinet, Viviani and Millerand, were\r\nSocialists, and a third member, Barthou, was a Radical who had as a\r\nprivate member of the Chamber, a short time before his appointment to\r\nthe cabinet, vigorously defended the railway men's \"right to strike.\"\r\nBut official responsibility had its usual effect.[17]\r\n\r\nNow began a series of dramatic events in the Chamber. The united\r\nSocialists maintained that the men had a legal right to strike and\r\nthat the government had denied to French citizens their legal\r\nprivileges. Briand replied (October 25) that the strike had nothing to\r\ndo with the labor problem. The government, had been confronted with\r\n\"an enterprise designed to ruin the country, an anarchistic movement\r\nwith civil war for its aim, and violence and organized destruction for\r\nits method\"; and he had treated it as a rebellion, not as a strike.\r\nThe government, he said, had evidence of a well-laid plot for\r\n_sabotage_; and the Syndicalist idea of liberty he characterized as a\r\n\"hideous figure of license.\"\r\n\r\nMillerand (October 27) characterized the strike as a \"criminal\r\nenterprise,\" and the _saboteurs_ as \"criminals\" guilty of \"a\r\nrevolutionary mobilization with a political object.\" For the\r\nSocialists Bouveri, a miner, replied. He defended bomb-throwing and\r\n_sabotage_; asked the Minister of War if, in case of invasion by a\r\nforeign foe, he would not blow up the bridges; and said the strikers\r\nwere engaged in a social war and had the same excuse for destroying\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nThe climax of the debate came October 29, when Briand, turning to the\r\nSocialists, said: \"I am going to tell you something that will make you\r\njump (que vous faire bondir). If the government had not found in the\r\nlaw that which enabled it to remain master of the frontiers of France\r\nand master of its railways, which are the indispensable instruments of\r\nthe national defense; if, in a word, the government had found it\r\nnecessary to resort to illegality, it would have done so.\"\r\n\r\nNo words can describe the disorder of the scene that followed this\r\nchallenge. Cries of \"Dictator!\" \"Resign!\" were mingled with catcalls\r\nand hisses. Finally Jaures was heard in bitter rebuke of his former\r\ncomrade. Viviani answered Jaures; they had fought together the battles\r\nof the workingman and would do so still \"if Socialism had not adopted\r\nthe methods of _sabotage_, of anti-patriotism, and of anarchy.\"\r\n\r\nA few weeks later Briand and his cabinet resigned, although sustained\r\nby a majority of the Chamber. But President Fallieres immediately\r\nrequested the dauntless Prime Minister to form a new cabinet. In his\r\nnew program he included measures that would greatly strengthen the\r\narms of the government in times of strikes, punishing _sabotage_ by\r\nheavy fines and penalties, penalizing the public railway servant for\r\nstriking, and contemplating an elaborate system of conciliation boards\r\npatterned after Millerand's plan.\r\n\r\nThese rigorous suggestions increased the flame of hatred against him,\r\nand his life was threatened. Nothing daunted, he proceeded in his\r\nwarfare against the C.G.T., which he denounced as a handful of\r\nplotters exercising a wicked tyranny over Socialists and workingmen.\r\nFinally, February 27, 1911, he resigned, refusing to hold office by\r\nthe sufferance of the reactionary Right. The Socialists voted with\r\ntheir enemies to dethrone their first Premier, whom they considered a\r\ntraitor to the course.[18]\r\n\r\nSo ended one of the most significant episodes of modern political\r\nhistory. Every government, especially every democratic government,\r\nwill within the next few decades be compelled to meet the railway\r\nproblem and the question of the relation of the government to its\r\nstate servants.\r\n\r\nTwo important details in the Briand affair are of especial interest.\r\n\r\nFirst, the Prime Minister's attempt to project the authority of the\r\nstate into the contract relations of the railway employees and the\r\ncompanies. Instead of hostility, Briand's plan might well have\r\ndeserved the support of the Socialists. For he was expanding the\r\nfunctions of the state, was enlisting the power of society in behalf\r\nof a contract that is of universal interest.\r\n\r\nSecondly, Briand's bill making it unlawful for a railway servant to\r\nstrike was quite as revolutionary as the C.G.T.'s contention that the\r\nstate had no right to interfere. Here, too, Briand was the Socialist\r\nand the Socialists were the individualists; the one recognized the\r\nparamount interests of society, the other saw only the interests of\r\nthe individual worker. Put to this test, French Socialism failed as\r\nsignally in theory as the violence, _sabotage_, and insubordination of\r\nthe C.G.T. failed in practice.[19]\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nWho were these revolutionary labor leaders, this small handful of\r\nplotters to whom Briand constantly alluded?[20] In order to understand\r\nthe Socialist movement in any country, both politically and\r\nindustrially, it is necessary to understand the organization of labor.\r\nSocialism began as a class movement, and in every country it is\r\nendeavoring to capture the labor organizations.[21]\r\n\r\nIn no two countries are the relations quite the same. In the United\r\nStates the unions have traditionally kept out of politics altogether.\r\nIn Great Britain they refused to be busied with politics until a few\r\nyears ago, when the Labor Party was organized. Since then a number of\r\nunion men have identified themselves rather loosely with Socialism. In\r\nGermany there is the closest co-operation between the party and the\r\nunions, but not any organic unity. In Belgium the political and\r\neconomic organizations are virtually merged.\r\n\r\nIn France the most interesting development has taken place. From the\r\nRevolution until 1864 no labor organizations were allowed. The\r\nNational Assembly abolished all the trade guilds and corporations. The\r\n_Loi le Chappelier_ forbade unions of workers and of masters, and the\r\n_Code Napoleon_ imposed a penalty of imprisonment on those engaging in\r\nunlawful combinations. In 1864 the criminal laws were revised, and\r\nunions of twenty members were allowed. The law of 1884 left the way\r\nuntrammeled for their development.[22]\r\n\r\nWithin a few years unions were formed everywhere.[23] In 1886 the\r\nGuesdists organized the National Federation of Trade Unions, a\r\nSocialist body of workers subordinated to the Workingman's Party. Soon\r\nthereafter the Municipal Socialists, the Broussists, founded the Paris\r\nLabor Exchange, built a large clubhouse for if, and succeeded in\r\ngetting an appropriation of 20,000 francs a year from the city for\r\nits maintenance. Within ten years about fifty of these exchanges were\r\nformed in as many cities, and about seventy per cent. of the union\r\nmembers belonged to them. The object of these exchanges was\r\neducational and benevolent. But they were soon made the hotbeds of\r\nSocialistic politics. In 1892 they were all federated in the\r\nFederation of Labor Exchanges (Federation du Bourse du Travail).\r\n\r\nIn 1895 Guesde's political adjunct, the National Federation of Trade\r\nUnions, became extinct. The Blanquists then organized a new\r\nfederation, the notorious General Confederation of Labor\r\n(Confederation Generale du Travail), commonly called the C.G.T. These\r\ntwo bodies were bitter rivals, after the French fashion, until, in\r\n1902, they amalgamated, retaining the name C.G.T.[24] The organization\r\nis dual, retaining the benevolent activities of the local exchanges\r\nand the trade activities of the local unions. These activities are\r\nfederated into national councils. The union of these councils forms\r\nthe central governing body of C.G.T. The organization allows a great\r\ndeal of local autonomy, but the central control is none the less\r\neffective. In 1907 the C.G.T. claimed 350,000 members, in 1911 it\r\nreported 600,000.\r\n\r\nThis body of workmen is known for its violence. Within its ranks has\r\nspread the doctrine known as revolutionary Syndicalism, a resurrection\r\nof the spirit of Proudhonism in the body of labor unionism. Briefly\r\nstated, it is class war in its most violent form without the aid of\r\nparliaments and politics; with the enginery of the general strike, and\r\nthe spirit of universal upheaval and anarchy. It is the most effective\r\noutbreak of Anarchism since the days of Bakunin.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual revival of the doctrine of violence may be dated from\r\nthe appearance of Georges Sorel's book, _The Socialist Future of Trade\r\nUnions_, in 1897, and the culmination of the tide in his volume\r\n_Reflections upon Violence_, in 1908.\r\n\r\nFor a movement so young Syndicalism has had a peculiarly expansive\r\nliterature, written by professors and journalists of the bourgeois\r\nclass, who live on respectable streets, receive you in comfortable\r\ndrawing-rooms, and from their upholstered ease display a fine zeal for\r\nthe oppressed proletariat.[25]\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to classify Syndicalism, for it refuses to be called\r\nAnarchism, repudiates the leadership of Socialism, and scorns to be\r\nmerely trade-unionism. The following are its principal characteristics:\r\n\r\n1. It is disheartened with Socialism because, it says, Socialists have\r\nlost their ideals in the race for political power. Law-making is\r\nuseless, because no laws can emancipate the workingmen. It therefore\r\ndespises governments and abjures parliaments. But its ideals are\r\nSocialistic; it believes \"in reorganizing society on a communistic\r\nbasis, so that, with a minimum of productive effort, the maximum of\r\nwell-being will be obtained.\"[26]\r\n\r\n2. But repudiating governments and parliaments, they say, does not\r\nmake them Anarchists. Syndicalists believe in local or communal\r\ngovernment. Their state is a glorified trade union whose activities\r\nare confined to economic functions, their nation is a collection of\r\nfederated communal trade societies. When I went among them they were\r\nespecially solicitous that they should not be regarded as \"mere\r\nAnarchists.\"\r\n\r\n3. Syndicalism is not trade-unionism pure and simple, because its\r\nmethod is violence and its ideal the industrial unit, not the trade or\r\ncraft unit. The weapon of Syndicalism is the general strike. A\r\ncircular issued by the executive committee in 1898 defined the general\r\nstrike as \"the cessation of work, which would place the country in the\r\nrigor of death, whose terrible and incalculable consequences would\r\nforce the government to capitulate at once. If it refused, the\r\nproletariat, in revolt from one end of France to the other, would be\r\nable to compel it.\" Sorel says that \"revolutionary Syndicalism\r\nnourishes in the masses the desire to strike, and it can thrive only\r\nin places where great strikes, occupied with acts of violence, have\r\ntaken place.\"[27] The strike committee of the C.G.T. in 1899\r\nproclaimed the general strike as \"the only practical method through\r\nwhich the working class can fully liberate itself from the\r\ncapitalistic and governmental yoke.\" The general strike includes the\r\nboycott, _sabotage_, and all kindred forms of violence.[28]\r\n\r\n4. Syndicalism revives the old revolutionary methods of conspiracy, of\r\na dominant minority swinging the masses into line; \"a conscious\r\nminority, which, through its example, sets the masses in motion and\r\ndrives them on.\"[29] There are plots, underground manoeuvers, and\r\nsudden outbursts. An air of mystery pervades their spectacular\r\nuprisings. In order to accomplish their purpose there must be a\r\nsolidarity of labor. But this unity is the result of the energy of the\r\n\"conscious few,\" not of the assertive many.\r\n\r\n5. Finally, Syndicalism proclaims that democracy is a \"fraud\"\r\nperpetrated upon the workingmen by the property-owning bourgeois;\r\nrepresentative government and majority rule is to them merely a polite\r\nform of tyranny, and patriotism a farce. Potaud says: \"Patriotism can\r\nonly be explained by the fact that all patriots without distinction\r\nown a part of the social property, and nothing is more absurd than a\r\npatriot without a patrimony.\"\r\n\r\n\"We workingmen will have none of these little fatherlands! Our country\r\nis the international world!\" cried Yvetot to the post-office strikers\r\nin Paris.\r\n\r\nThey regard the soldiers with enmity. At the national congress at\r\nAmiens, 1906, they resolved that the \"anti-military and anti-patriotic\r\npropaganda should be promulgated with the greatest zeal and\r\naudacity.\"[30]\r\n\r\nSyndicalism is the extreme pessimism of the laboring class. It reached\r\nits height about 1907-1908. Portions of France were terrorized, more\r\nby its extravagant language than by its overt acts. There was no limit\r\nto their superlatives. \"Rip up the bourgeois!\" \"Turn your rifles on\r\nyour officers!\" \"Cut buttonholes in the skins of the bourgeois!\" were\r\nfamiliar battle-cries. There was so much talk about putting vitriol\r\ninto coffee, ground glass into bread, pulling the fire-plug out of\r\nengines, that finally language came to mean nothing.\r\n\r\nThe \"new commune\" thought it was coming into reality with the\r\npost-office and railway strikes. We have seen how these outbreaks were\r\nmet by a Radical government. Since then their ardor has cooled, and\r\ntheir adjectives grown flabby. They are now devoting themselves to\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nAnti-militarism does not mean merely opposition to standing armies.\r\nAll Socialists are opposed to the maintenance of armaments.\r\nAnti-militarism is opposition to all force used by the state to assert\r\nits sovereignty. This includes the police and constabulary as well as\r\nthe army, and courts and parliaments as well as the navy. Since\r\nsoldiers and policemen are servants of the state, and since the state\r\nis the expression of nationalism, the anti-militarist concludes that\r\nhis supreme enemy is the nation, the master of the soldier.\r\nAnti-militarism is the forerunner of anti-patriotism.\r\n\r\nIn 1906 this doctrine was so rampant that, on May Day, an uprising was\r\nfeared in Paris. A prophet had arisen, proclaiming the most extreme\r\ndoctrines of anti-patriotism. This was Gustave Herve, a teacher of\r\nhistory from Auxerre. He had spoken the suitable word, and became\r\nfamous overnight: \"The French flag arose from dirt!\"; and to the\r\npeasantry he shouted, \"Plant your country's flag in the barnyard\r\ndung-heaps!\" He came to Paris and started a daily paper, _La Guerre\r\nSociale_. Syndicalists and Socialists flocked to his standard, and\r\neven Jaures was compelled to acknowledge his influence.[31]\r\n\r\nHerve has a simple remedy for militarism: \"The way to stop war is to\r\nrefuse to fight.\" He exhorts his fellow-Socialists to join the army,\r\nbut fire on their commanders, not on their comrades. He was arrested\r\nseveral times for these utterances and the overt acts that they\r\naroused. Some years ago a Parisian workingman was arrested for an\r\noffense against public morals. He protested his innocence and, when\r\nreleased, in revenge killed a policeman. He was promptly executed.\r\nHerve used the occasion for an onslaught upon the government in his\r\npaper. He said: \"If the working class would display one-tenth of the\r\nenergy that this workman displayed, the social revolution would not be\r\nlong in coming.\" For his imprudence he was imprisoned for a term of\r\nfour years.[32] His influence is waning, but the words he and his\r\nfollowing have planted in the hearts of the conscripts may bear some\r\nstrange fruit.[33]\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nWhile the French Socialists have been prolific in the developing of\r\nfactions and theories, they have been slow at achieving practical\r\nresults. As early as 1887 they acquired considerable power in Paris.\r\nThey contented themselves with establishing a labor exchange and\r\nextending a few municipal charities.\r\n\r\nThe local program, as outlined at Lyons, included: the feeding of\r\nschool children; an eight-hour day and a fixed minimum wage for\r\nmunicipal employees; the abolition of the \"_octroi_\"; sanitary\r\nregulations for workshops and factories; abolition of private\r\nemployment bureaus; establishment of homes for the aged; maternity\r\nhospitals; free medical attendance for the poor; free public baths;\r\nsanitaria for children of workmen; free legal advice for workingmen;\r\npensions for municipal employees; and the publication of a municipal\r\nbulletin giving record of all the votes cast by the councilors.[34]\r\n\r\nIn 1892 a number of important cities were won by the Socialists, and\r\nin September of that year the first convention of Socialist municipal\r\ncouncilors was held at Saint-Ouen. The discussions were filled with\r\nrevolutionary phraseology. In a few years the ideas of violence were\r\ndiscarded for more practical issues. In 1895, when the municipal\r\nconvention met at Paris, the time was largely given over to the\r\nquestion of organizing the municipal public service, public hygiene,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nIn Lille the Socialists began their administration of local affairs by\r\nraising the budget from 740,000 francs in 1897 to 1,019,000 francs in\r\n1899. Free industrial education was established for the working\r\npeople; a municipal theater was opened; school children were fed and\r\nclothed; and an attempt was made to regulate the length of the working\r\nday and fix a minimum wage for municipal employees. At Dijon the\r\nfeeding and clothing of school children was regulated by the amount of\r\nwages earned by the parents. Free medical aid was provided, and a\r\ndrug-store was induced to sell medicines to the poor at reduced cost.\r\nThe local labor exchange was voted an appropriation from public funds.\r\n\r\nThese illustrations show the general trend of municipal Socialism in\r\nFrance. The results are not numerous. But the French Socialists\r\njustify their meager practical results by pointing to the centralized\r\nsystem of administration which enables the prefect and other\r\nadministrative officers to veto many of the acts of the municipal\r\ncouncils. The first thing that the Socialists attempted to do in their\r\ntowns was the readjustment of the finances for the benefit of the\r\nworking classes. Their acts were vetoed on the ground that they were\r\n_ultra vires_. The attempt to fix a minimum wage for municipal\r\nemployees met the same fate. Then the municipalities petitioned the\r\ncentral government for greater financial autonomy. This was denied. In\r\nRoubaix the opening of a municipal drug-store was disallowed by the\r\nprefect on the ground that the corporations act does not grant that\r\npower to municipalities. Municipal bakeries met the same fate. During\r\nthe last few years, however, the rigor of the central administration\r\nhas relaxed and the towns are allowed greater liberty in municipal\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nUnder the circumstances it is perhaps little wonder that French\r\nmunicipal Socialism is a poor housekeeper. You look in vain for the\r\nhigh ideals of the Socialist evangelist. If you visit the towns where\r\nSocialism abounds you will be told that the Socialists have spent more\r\nmoney on the poor than their predecessors. You will find better\r\nnurseries for the babies of the working mothers, meals and stockings\r\ndoled out to school children of the poor, here and there a physician\r\nor a lawyer retained by the town to render free service to the working\r\npeople. On inquiry you will find that the soldiers are drawing\r\nincreased pensions, the widows and orphans of the workingmen are\r\nespecially provided for, and that bread is delivered to the needy at\r\nthe door so they need not go ask for it, need not be beggars.\r\n\r\nYou are impressed that these proletarian town governments are trying\r\nto destroy poverty. Their ideal is noble, but some of their efforts\r\nare very crude.\r\n\r\nThe French Socialists are not by any means a unit on the municipal\r\nquestion. In 1911 it was the principal question discussed at their\r\nnational convention at Saint-Quentin. Professor Millhaud of the\r\nUniversity of Geneva, in a very clear and able speech, pointed out the\r\nmerits of municipalization, citing the ownership of street railways,\r\ngas, waterworks, garbage plants, and other public utilities of\r\nEuropean and American cities. He included municipal drug-stores, the\r\nfeeding and clothing of school children, the establishing of\r\nplaygrounds, and many other municipal activities familiar to American\r\npractice, in his local Socialistic program.\r\n\r\nHis exposition met with the approval of the Jaures faction. But the\r\nGuesdists were not satisfied. \"Who would benefit by cheap municipal\r\ngas?\" cried a delegate from the rear of the hall. \"The rich man, for\r\nhe needs a great deal of gas to light up his big house. But what\r\nlaboring man needs gas? When has he time to read? In the evening he is\r\ntoo tired, and he gives no receptions.\" Guesde maintained with great\r\nvehemence that municipal ownership and state ownership are not\r\nSocialism; they may be a step toward Socialism, but often result in\r\nsubstituting the tyranny of the state for the tyranny of the private\r\nemployer.\r\n\r\nThe convention adopted a municipal program after a prolonged\r\ndiscussion that brought out clearly the fact that the Guesdists are\r\nnot devoted to state or municipal ownership as a principle, but only\r\nas a means to a greater end.\r\n\r\nDuring the last few years a very important movement has been taking\r\nplace among the peasantry of southern France. Under the leadership of\r\nCompere-Morel, a gardener and member of the Chamber of Deputies,\r\nSocialism is spreading rapidly among these small and independent\r\nlandowners. There are several million of these thrifty peasants in\r\nFrance, and their acquisition to Socialism will mean, not only a great\r\nincrease in political power, but a modification of their theory of\r\nproperty. The Socialists are luring the small land-holder by telling\r\nhim that they are with him in his fight against the large estates.\r\nThey assure the peasant that they have no designs upon his small\r\nholdings. It is the _great_ property, not merely property, that is the\r\nobject of their hostility.[35]\r\n\r\nThere are other evidences that French Socialism is mellowing. Most of\r\nits leaders are bourgeois. Of the seventy-six united Socialists in the\r\npresent Chamber, only thirty are workingmen, or trade-union officials;\r\neight are professors in the University or secondary schools; seven are\r\njournalists; seven are barristers; seven are farmers; six are\r\nphysicians; three are school teachers; and two are engineers. This\r\ndoes not suggest class war.\r\n\r\nSocialism is a power in French politics. An observer who moves among\r\nthe middle class wonders how much of a power it is in French life. The\r\nRadical Party would be considered Socialistic in England or the United\r\nStates; half of it calls itself Socialist-Radical. It rules the\r\nRepublic from the Chamber of Deputies. Everywhere you hear the people\r\ntalking about collectivism, the nationalization of railways, of mines,\r\nof vineyards, of docks, and ultimately of wheat-fields and\r\nmarket-gardens.\r\n\r\nBut the French are a nation of small farmers and shopkeepers who cling\r\nto their property while they argue and vote for their radicalism and\r\nSocialism. This is the duality of their temperament; they love\r\npossessions and they love philosophical speculation. They keep their\r\nfields and their little shops, and speculate about the new to-morrow.\r\nThey vote and debate with imaginative fervor; they pay taxes with\r\nstolid commonplace silence. In measuring the strength of French\r\nSocialism it is necessary to keep this in mind. Not that the\r\nFrenchman does not take Socialism seriously. He takes it as seriously\r\nas he takes monarchism or republicanism, and much more seriously than\r\nhe takes religion. There is only one thing he takes more\r\nseriously--his property.\r\n\r\nThat is why the Socialists number among their adherents all classes\r\nand all conditions of men, from Anatole France, most fastidious of\r\nliterary aristocrats, to gaunt and hungry proletarians who infest the\r\ncellars and garrets of ancient Paris.\r\n\r\nThe French are, after all, the greatest of realists. They speculate in\r\ndreams and delicate theories; but they never lose their grip on their\r\nlittle farms and their little shops and the gold bonds of Russia.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] GEORGES WEIL, _Histoire du Mouvement Socialiste en France_, Paris,\r\n1904, p. 220.\r\n\r\n[2] Other groups--the word party is hardly applicable in the French\r\nChamber of Deputies--are the reactionary Right; the republican\r\nConservatives, or Center; the Radical Left, or Liberals.\r\n\r\n[3] WEIL, _supra cit._, p. 276.\r\n\r\n[4] In France, when any one candidate for the Chamber of Deputies\r\nfails to receive a majority of the votes cast, a second ballot is\r\ntaken, for the two receiving the highest number of votes\r\n\r\n[5] Quoted by ENSOR, _Modern Socialism_, pp. 48-55.

It met the obstinate opposition of the Conservatives. The\r\noperation of the law is of interest, and instructive. The workmen\r\nnaturally rejoiced over this increased leisure. The employers, on the\r\nother hand, found themselves paying wages for hours in which no\r\nservice was rendered. They lowered the wages; the workmen resisted.\r\nFinally the law was so amended as virtually to annul its effect, in\r\ncertain trades. The Socialists became irritated to the verge of\r\nbreaking their _entente_ with the Radicals.\r\n\r\n[12] Proceedings Chamber of Deputies, March 19, 1909.\r\n\r\n[13] During this agitation the teachers of the public schools, who had\r\nformed a great number of associations, joined in the demand of the\r\nSyndicalists.

Briand, the Minister of Education, and for a time\r\na strike of schoolmasters was threatened, but it did not materialize.\r\n\r\n[14] _L'Humanite_ is the leading Socialist daily of Paris. Briand had\r\nwritten editorials for it in his \"red\" days.\r\n\r\n[15] These sections declare that the employment, or abetting or\r\ninstigating the employment, of any means of stopping or impeding\r\nrailway traffic is a crime; and if it has been planned at a seditious\r\nmeeting, the instigators are as liable to punishment as the authors of\r\nthe crime, even if they did not intend to provoke the destruction of\r\nrailway property. The penalties imposed are very severe.\r\n\r\n[16] Placards displayed the bitterness of the men. \"For our vengeance\r\nBriand will suffice\" was read on the walls under flaming posters that\r\nquoted fiery sentences from Briand's earlier speeches.\r\n\r\n[17] Viviani, Minister of Justice, resigned soon after the close of\r\nthe strike. He did not agree with Briand in his efforts to pass a law\r\nmaking all railway strikes illegal. He said as long as railways were\r\nprivate property men had the right to strike, but not to destroy\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\n[18] Before his resignation, the old-age pension bill had passed the\r\nSenate and thus became a law. The Socialists supported the bill; but\r\nGuesde voted against it in spite of his party's instructions, because\r\nlabor was charged with contributing to the fund. The syndicalists were\r\nalso violently opposed to it because they believe the amount of the\r\npension is too small.\r\n\r\n[19] When in January, 1912, M. Poincare was appointed Prime Minister,\r\nhe promptly invited Briand into his cabinet as vice-president and\r\nMillerand as Minister of War.\r\n\r\n[20] The co-operative movement is spreading gradually throughout\r\nFrance. There are two kinds of societies--the Socialist and the\r\nindependent. In 1896 there were 202 co-operative productive societies.\r\nIn 1907 there were 362. The following figures show the increase in the\r\nnumber of co-operative stores: 1902--1,641; 1903--1,683; 1906--1,994;\r\n1907--2,166.\r\n\r\n[21] The following table, compiled from the reports of the Minister of\r\nLabor, shows the growth of the labor-union movement:\r\n\r\n  Year    Number of    Number of\r\n           Unions       Members\r\n  1885       221         ...\r\n  1886       280         ...\r\n  1887       501         ...\r\n  1888       725         ...\r\n  1889       821         ...\r\n  1890     1,006       139,692\r\n  1891     1,250       205,152\r\n  1892     1,589       288,770\r\n  1893     1,926       402,125\r\n  1894     2,178       403,430\r\n  1895     2,163       419,781\r\n  1896     2,243       422,777\r\n  1898     2,324       437,739\r\n  1899     2,361       419,761\r\n  1900     2,685       491,647\r\n  1901     3,287       588,832\r\n  1902     3,679       614,173\r\n  1903     3,934       643,757\r\n  1904     4,227       715,576\r\n  1905     4,625       781,344\r\n  1906     4,857       836,134\r\n  1907     5,322       896,012\r\n  1908     5,524       957,102\r\n\r\n\r\n[22] See _Journal of Political Economy_, March, 1909, for a\r\ncomprehensive article on French labor unions by O.D. SKELTON.\r\n\r\n[23] From the beginning there were two kinds of unions, named after\r\nthe color of their membership cards. The \"yellows\" are those pursuing\r\na policy of peace, and the \"reds\" are the militants.\r\n\r\n[24] The following figures show the increase of strikes since the\r\norganization of the C.G.T.:\r\n\r\n    Years      Average      Average\r\n                Number       Number      Average Number\r\n              of Strikes   of Strikers    of Days Idle\r\n  1890-1898      379         71,961        1,163,478\r\n  1899-1907      855        214,660        3,992,976\r\n\r\n\r\n[25] The doctrines of Syndicalism may be found in the writings of\r\nGeorges Sorel.

He begins with the\r\nsignificant year 1789; glorifies the violence, and praises the\r\nSocialistic manifestations and the heroism of the revolutionists, that\r\nhave made the past century one of turmoil and perpetual commotion.\r\nThis book is a sample of the reading given into the hands of the\r\nchildren of the Republic. I was told, upon careful inquiry, that a\r\nlarge number of the primary and secondary school teachers are\r\nSocialists. Thiers, before he became President, while still a\r\nfunctionary of monarchy, objected to the establishment of government\r\nschools in every village, because, he said, he did not want \"a red\r\npriest of Socialism in every town.\" To-day he would find these \"red\r\npriests\" everywhere. They have even organized _syndicats_ and joined\r\nthe C.G.T.\r\n\r\n[32] When I called upon him in the Prison Sante he told me that he was\r\nas sincerely opposed to military measures as ever; but that it would\r\nbe a long time before the people would regard all mankind, rather than\r\na single ethnic group, as the object of their patriotism. Pointing to\r\nthe grim walls of his prison, he said, \"Vive la Republique! Vive la\r\nLiberte!\"\r\n\r\n[33] Syndicalism and anti-militarism have spread to Spain and Italy.\r\nBut they have not found favor among the phlegmatic North-European\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n[34] See STEHELIN, _Essais de Socialisme Municipal_, 1901.\r\n\r\n[35] See _Les Paysans et le Socialisme_, a speech delivered by\r\nCompere-Morel, in the Chamber of Deputies, December 6, 1909.

It is a small country, \"at\r\nthe meeting-point of the three great European civilizations,\"\r\nVandervelde, the leader of the Belgian Socialists, has pointed out.\r\nAnd his boast is true that the Belgian Socialists have absorbed the\r\nleading characteristics of the social movement in each of these\r\ncountries. \"From England Belgian Socialists have learned self-help,\r\nand have copied their free and independent organizations, principally\r\nin the form of co-operative societies. From Germany they have adopted\r\nthe political tactics and the fundamental doctrines which were\r\nexpressed for the first time in the 'Communist Manifesto.' From France\r\nthey have taken their idealistic tendencies, and the integral\r\nconception of Socialism, considered as an extension of the\r\nrevolutionary philosophy and as a new religion, an extension and a\r\nrealization of Christianity.\"\r\n\r\nThis threefold growth would have been impossible if the environment\r\nhad not been favorable. The Belgian population is congested into\r\nindustrial towns that are thickly strewn over the country, like the\r\nsuburbs of one vast manufacturing community. These working people have\r\nalways been miserably housed and poorly fed. In 1903-05 a public\r\ninquiry into housing conditions was instituted in Brussels. In the\r\nmost congested portions of the city, 564 households, comprising 2,224\r\npersons, lived in one-room tenements. The houses were in miserable\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nThe commission appointed after the riots of 1886 describes conditions\r\nthat are little better than those that prevailed in England in 1830.\r\nEven as late as 1902, out of 750,000 working men and women one-tenth\r\nonly worked less than ten hours a day; the rest worked from ten to\r\ntwelve hours. One-fourth of these working people had a wage of 2\r\nfrancs (40 cents) a day, another fourth had 2 to 3 francs (40 to 60\r\ncents) a day, and the upper section only 3.50 to 4.50 francs (70 cents\r\nto 90 cents) a day. The government inquiry in 1896 disclosed the\r\nfollowing rate of wages:\r\n\r\n  170,000 persons received less than 2 fr. (40c.) a day.\r\n  172,000 persons received less than 2-3 fr. (40-60c.) a day.\r\n  160,000 persons received less than 3-4 fr. (60-80c.) a day.\r\n  102,000 persons received more than 4 fr. (80c.) a day.[1]\r\n\r\nIn the low countries where agriculture is the leading occupation,\r\nconditions are no better. The peasant is poor; the conditions of\r\ntenancy hard, though recent legislation has modified them somewhat in\r\nthe tenant's favor; and the holdings small. Agricultural wages are\r\nvery low. The men in the Flemish district receive an average of 1.63\r\nfrancs (33 cents) a day, without board, or about .90 francs (18 cents)\r\nwith board. The women receive 1.06 francs (21 cents) without board and\r\n.64 francs (12-1/2 cents) with board.[2]\r\n\r\nHere, then, is a population of industrial and peasant workers who are\r\nbarely able to make a living, who have little time and less\r\nopportunity for education and general development. The percentage of\r\nilliteracy is very great; and is equaled only by the most backward\r\ncountries of southern Europe. In 1902, out of every 1,000 militiamen,\r\n101 were entirely illiterate; in France, 46; in England, 37; in\r\nHolland, 23; in Switzerland, 20; in Denmark, .08; in Germany, .07. In\r\n1909 Rowntree estimated the illiteracy in the four largest Belgian\r\ncities to be 11.75 per cent.; in the Flemish communes, 34.69 per\r\ncent.; and in the Walloon communes (excepting Liege), 17.34 per cent.\r\n\r\nOutward circumstances have not been wanting to arouse this teeming\r\npopulation into violent discontent. The government for years paid no\r\nheed to their misery, and the Church, which is very powerful in\r\nBelgium, was content to distribute charity and consolation, and to\r\nadmonish the employer to patriarchal care for his men.\r\n\r\nThe national status of the country is guaranteed by the powers; there\r\nis no fear of invasion and no need for the intolerable military\r\nburdens that weigh down the great countries of Europe. There have been\r\nno international complications. This little country, with its clusters\r\nof thriving towns, its mines, farms, and seaports, could settle down\r\ncontentedly to its daily tasks like a large family.\r\n\r\nThe great manufacturers and industrial leaders took even less interest\r\nin the welfare of the working people than the state or the Church. No\r\none seemed to care how the worker fared, and when he himself learned\r\nto care the first reactions were violent.\r\n\r\nWe will limit ourselves, in this inquiry, to the political development\r\nof the labor movement.\r\n\r\nBelgium is a constitutional monarchy. The Constitution, provides for a\r\nparliament composed of the Senate and the Chamber of Representatives,\r\nboth elected by the people, the Representatives by direct, the\r\nSenators by indirect, elections. The King has the veto power and the\r\npower to prorogue parliament. A general election follows prorogation,\r\nin which the whole membership of Senate and House are elected. The\r\ncommunes are governed by elective communal councils.\r\n\r\nFrom the establishment of the constitution, in 1831, there have been\r\ntwo leading political parties--the Clerical or Catholic, and the\r\nLiberal. The Clerical Party has been not merely conservative, it has\r\nbeen reactionary. It clings not only to monarchic prerogatives, but to\r\necclesiastical supremacy. This medieval policy it imposed upon school\r\nand government and Church. The party has until very recently been in\r\nthe majority. It is strongest in the low counties, among the\r\nagricultural Flemings. When the activity of the Socialists and\r\nRadicals forced the question upon the country, a \"left\" wing of the\r\nparty began to interest itself in the laboring man, through the\r\ntraditional methods of the Church, rather than by means of state\r\ninterference.\r\n\r\nThe Liberal Party is a protest, not only against the predominant\r\ninfluence of the Church in political affairs, but also against the\r\nfinancial policies of the Conservatives. The Liberals early espoused\r\nthe cause of free schools, modified tariffs, greater local autonomy,\r\nand liberal election laws.\r\n\r\nThe election laws confined the electorate to the few property-holders\r\nand professional men of the country. In 1890, out of 1,800,000 male\r\ncitizens, 133,000 were qualified electors.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThese were the conditions that prevailed when the Socialists quite\r\nsuddenly appeared on the scene. There had been a Socialist propaganda\r\nfor years in Belgium. Brussels was a city of refuge to many fleeing\r\nrevolutionists of 1848. In 1857 a labor union was organized among the\r\nspinners and weavers of Ghent. The same year Colin published his book,\r\n_What Is Social Science?_ This volume prepared the way for the\r\nremarkable collectivist movement, which was stimulated into modern\r\nactivity by Anselee, a workingman of Ghent and organizer of the\r\nVooruit Co-operative Society. Caesar de Paepe, a disciple of Colin and\r\na man of remarkable intellectual endowments, tried to bring unity to\r\nthe Belgian movement. But the factionalism was not cast aside until\r\n1885, when the Belgian Labor Party (Parti Ouvrier Belge) was\r\norganized.\r\n\r\nNow Socialists of all factions were drawn together. But, unlike\r\nSocialists in other countries, they did not expend their energies on\r\npolitical action. The Belgian labor movement had a threefold\r\norigin--the co-operative movement of Colin, the labor-union movement,\r\nand the Socialistic or political movement of de Paepe. These three\r\nactivities, united in the Labor Party, have continued to develop,\r\nuntil they are a model for Socialists in all countries.\r\n\r\nThe organization of the party is simple. The various organizations are\r\nfederated into large groups, e.g., the co-operative group, each with\r\na separate organization. The provinces and communes have their local\r\ncommittees for each separate activity. Over the entire party sits a\r\ngeneral council (conseil general). An executive committee of nine is\r\nchosen from this council, and this committee has practical control of\r\nthe party. The annual convention is the supreme authority. It elects\r\nthe general council and decides, in democratic fashion, all important\r\nquestions of policy and activity. Every constituent organization, such\r\nas the co-operative societies, etc., contributes from its funds to the\r\nsupport of the party. The party is therefore a federation of many\r\nsocieties with various activities, not a vast group of individual\r\nvoters, as the German Social Democracy. Its solidarity is not\r\nindividual, but federal.\r\n\r\nThe organization of the Labor Party proved a stimulus to all the\r\nconstituent societies. From 1885 to 1895 over 400 co-operative\r\nsocieties were formed, and within a few years 7,000 mutual aid\r\nsocieties were organized. The membership of the labor unions increased\r\nfrom less than 50,000 in 1880 to 62,350 in 1889, and nearly 150,000 in\r\n1905.\r\n\r\nThe Socialist movement had now achieved solidarity, and was prepared\r\nto enter into a conflict for power. Its issues were two: universal\r\nsuffrage and free secular education. The second was necessarily\r\nincluded in the first; for without parliamentary power it would be\r\nimpossible to secure liberal educational laws, and without a liberal\r\nfranchise it would be impossible to get parliamentary power. All their\r\npolitical energies were therefore devoted to the reform of the\r\nelection laws.\r\n\r\nIt is in this activity that the Belgian movement forms for our\r\npurpose one of the most instructive chapters of European Socialism.\r\nHere is a proletarian horde deprived of participation in government in\r\na constitutional monarchy, struggling toward political recognition. It\r\nis armed with all the weapons of militant Socialism: a revolutionary\r\ntradition; a national history rich in mob violence, street brawls, and\r\nconflicts with police and soldiers; possessed of a well-organized\r\nparty, a class solidarity, and capable and courageous leaders who are\r\nwilling to go, and do go, to the extreme of the general strike and\r\nviolence in order to achieve their goal.\r\n\r\nIn short, here we have the Socialist political ideal working itself\r\nfrom theory into reality through class struggle. But there is the\r\nusual important modification of the Marxian conditions; viz., the\r\nliberal bourgeois prove a potent ally to the Socialists in the press\r\nand on the floor of the Chamber of Representatives. While the\r\nSocialists were surging in vehement earnestness around the Parliament\r\nHouse, the Liberals were as earnestly pleading their cause within.\r\n\r\nThe definite fight for universal suffrage began a few years before the\r\norganization of the Labor Party. In 1866 a group of workingmen issued\r\nan appeal to their fellows to begin the battle for the ballot. In 1879\r\nthe Socialists issued a manifesto which stated the case as follows:\r\n\"'All powers are derived from the nation; all Belgians are equal\r\nbefore the law,' says the Constitution of 1831.\r\n\r\n\"In reality all powers are derived from a small number of privileged\r\nones, and all the Belgians are divided into two classes--those who are\r\nrich and have rights, and those who are poor and have burdens.\r\n\r\n\"We wish to see this inequality vanish, at least before the\r\nballot-box. For the most numerous class of society ought to be\r\nrepresented in the Chamber of Representatives, because the people\r\nwhose daily bread depends upon the prosperity of the country should\r\nhave the power to participate in public affairs.\r\n\r\n\"Constitutions are not immutable, and what was solemnly promulgated on\r\none occasion may, without revolution, be altered on another.\"[3]\r\n\r\nThe proclamation then proceeded to call a meeting at Brussels for the\r\nfollowing January (1880). At this meeting it was decided to circulate\r\na monster petition asking Parliament to pass a liberal election law\r\nand to organize a demonstration to be held in Brussels the following\r\nsummer. In this, the first of a long series of demonstrations, about\r\n6,000 persons from various parts of the kingdom paraded the streets of\r\nthe capital. There was a clash with the police, and a number of\r\narrests were made. From 1881 to 1885 the Liberals tried to persuade\r\nthe Clericals to agree upon a constitutional revision; and the\r\nSocialists brought to bear upon them all the pressure of the streets.\r\nBut the Clericals were firm. Then the Socialists tried another\r\nmanoeuver. They issued a manifesto \"to the people of Belgium,\"\r\ncomplaining of the dominion of the Church over education, the dominion\r\nof a few families over the nation, and the failure of the government\r\nto grant liberty to the people. \"The hour has come for all citizens to\r\nrally under the republican flag.\"\r\n\r\nInstead of a republican uprising, something more significant and\r\npotent occurred; the Labor Party was organized, welding together all\r\nthe forces of discontent and unifying their demands into a protest so\r\nstrong that the government was finally compelled to yield. Not,\r\nhowever, until it had exhausted almost every resource of resistance.\r\n\r\nThe party was organized just in the crux of time. A financial crisis\r\nwas beginning to increase the hardships of the industrial classes. The\r\nunrest was intensified by an ingenious piece of propagandist\r\nliterature, a _Workingman's Catechism_ (_Catechism du Peuple_),\r\nwritten by a workingman. Two hundred thousand copies in French and\r\n60,000 in Flemish were scattered among the discontented people. Its\r\ninfluence was wonderful. A few questions will indicate the power that\r\nlay behind its simple questions and answers.\r\n\r\n    _Question._ \"Who are you?\"\r\n\r\n    _Answer._ \"I am a slave.\"\r\n\r\n    _Q._ \"Are you not a man?\"\r\n\r\n    _A._ \"From the point of view of humanity I am a man, but in\r\n    relation to society I am a slave.\"\r\n\r\n    _Q._ \"What is the 25th article of the Constitution?\"\r\n\r\n    _A._ \"The 25th article of the Constitution says: 'All power is\r\n    derived from the nation.'\"\r\n\r\n    _Q._ \"Is this true?\"\r\n\r\n    _A._ \"It is a falsehood.\"\r\n\r\n    _Q._ \"Why?\"\r\n\r\n    _A._ \"Because the nation is composed of 5,720,807 inhabitants,\r\n    about 6,000,000, and of this 6,000,000 only 117,000 are\r\n    consulted in the making of laws.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so through every grievance, social, economic, and political. Every\r\nworkman learned his catechism. Those who could not read gathered in\r\ngroups around their more fortunate comrades and listened to the\r\neffective questions and answers.\r\n\r\nBy the beginning of 1886 the little land was a seething caldron of\r\npolitical and economic unrest. The strike movement began at Liege and\r\nsoon spread to Charleroi and other industrial centers. There was\r\nenough destruction of property and clashing with police and soldiery\r\nto create a panic in the country. In Brussels business was at a\r\nstandstill for days. The Socialist Party, in a circular issued to the\r\npeople, said: \"The country is visited by a terrible crisis. The\r\ndisinherited classes are suffering. Strikes are multiplying, riots are\r\nprovoked by the misery. The constantly decreasing wages are spreading\r\nconsternation everywhere.\"\r\n\r\nThe disorder aroused a number of Anarchists in Brussels. They posted\r\nanonymous placards inciting the people to violence. The Socialists\r\nrepudiated the Anarchists, and one of their orators said: \"Do not let\r\nyourselves be carried away by violence; that will only benefit your\r\nadversaries.\"\r\n\r\nA mass demonstration was planned, but the mayor of Brussels prohibited\r\nit. The Labor Party, however, were allowed to hold their annual\r\nconvention and to march under their red flag, the government merely\r\nrequesting that the demonstrants refrain from shouting, \"Vive la\r\nRepublique!\" Thirty thousand laboring men joined in the demonstration.\r\nThe Liberals and Radicals refused to take part in it because they\r\nclaimed it was only a workingman's movement, and the Anarchists\r\nrefused because \"elections lead to nothing.\" This demonstration was so\r\nserious and imposing that it made a deep impression upon the people,\r\nand was not without effect upon the government.\r\n\r\nThe crisis finally passed over. A great many rioters were imprisoned\r\nin spite of the popular clamor for universal amnesty. The general\r\nstrike brought no immediate advantage to the workmen.\r\n\r\nThe next few years the Socialists devoted to organization. They were\r\ndetermined not to enter upon extended strikes again without thorough\r\npreparation. In the meantime the Liberal Party split. The Radicals, or\r\nProgressists, at their first congress in 1877 declared themselves in\r\nfavor of the separation of Church and state, military reform,\r\ncompulsory education, social and electoral reform. They were, however,\r\nnot yet prepared to commit themselves to universal suffrage. They\r\nfavored rather an educational test for voters. This, however, they\r\nabandoned in 1890, and virtually placed themselves upon the Socialist\r\nplatform.\r\n\r\nOn August 10, 1890, another great demonstration in favor of universal\r\nsuffrage took place in Brussels. Over 40,000 men joined in the parade.\r\nThe Progressists did not take part in the marching, but they were\r\nstationed along the route to cheer the men in line. Before they\r\ndispersed, all the participants united in taking a solemn oath that\r\nthey would not give up the fight \"until the Belgian people, through\r\nuniversal suffrage, should regain their fatherland.\" This is the\r\nfamous \"Oath of August 10.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this demonstration the Progressists joined with the Socialists\r\nin a conference for discussing ways and means for securing universal\r\nsuffrage.[4] This conference is notable because it drew Radicals,\r\nProgressists, and Socialists into a united campaign for suffrage\r\nreform. The conference resolved to organize demonstrations in every\r\ncorner of the kingdom and to memorialize Parliament. This was to be a\r\nfinal peaceful appeal. If it remained unheeded a general strike would\r\nfollow. The bourgeois Progressists assented to this ultimatum.\r\n\r\nA few days before the Socialist-Progressist conference met, a clerical\r\nsocial congress had convened at Liege. The agitation of the Labor\r\nParty had at last aroused the Conservatives. The resolutions of this\r\nconference were pervaded by the traditional apostolic paternalistic\r\nspirit of the Church. It demanded social reform, amelioration of harsh\r\nconditions, state arbitration, industrial insurance; but it set its\r\nface against universal suffrage. On the wings of an awakened\r\nconservatism it tried to ride the whirlwind of Socialism.\r\n\r\nBut no halfway measures would now placate the agitators. The great\r\nmass of Belgian workmen were aroused, and nothing but the ballot would\r\nsatisfy them.\r\n\r\nA propaganda was begun in the army. The enlistment laws were favorable\r\nto the rich, who could purchase freedom from military service. The\r\npoor conscripts were especially susceptible to the Socialist\r\npropaganda.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1890 at the Labor Party's annual convention it was\r\nsuggested that, inasmuch as the parliament of the Few had not heeded\r\nthe wishes of the nation, a parliament of the People should be called,\r\nto be composed of as many members as the existing parliament, but\r\nchosen by universal suffrage. Even a program was proposed for this\r\nfancied parliament.\r\n\r\nBy this time the petitions prepared by the suffrage congress were\r\nready. In every arrondissement there were demonstrations. In Brussels\r\n8,000 men marched to the city hall and handed the mayor their petition\r\nprotesting against the privileged election laws and demanding\r\nuniversal suffrage. From every village in the kingdom protests were\r\nbrought to the government demanding universal suffrage.\r\n\r\nFinally on November 27, 1890, a Liberal member in the Chamber of\r\nRepresentatives proposed a change in the Constitution enlarging the\r\nelectoral franchise. He explained the injustice of the limited\r\nfranchise, dwelt on the dangers of strikes and riots, and said that he\r\nbelieved the Belgian workmen as capable of exercising the rights of\r\ncitizenship as those of neighboring countries. All parties agreed to\r\ndiscuss the amendment. The debate held popular excitement in abeyance.\r\nBut as it became more and more evident that nothing would be done the\r\nworkingman became restive. Early in 1892 riots broke out in various\r\ncities. The situation became acute. Socialists and Radicals organized\r\na popular referendum on the question. It was not an official\r\nreferendum, and its results were not binding. But it was an effective\r\nmethod of propaganda, and in many of the communes the councils gave it\r\ntheir sanction, thereby lending it the color of legality.\r\n\r\nFive propositions were submitted to the voters: (1) manhood suffrage\r\nat twenty-one years; (2) manhood suffrage at twenty-five years; (3)\r\nexclusion of illiterates and persons in receipt of public or private\r\ncharity; (4) household suffrage and mental capacity defined by law;\r\n(5) the exclusion of all who have not passed an elementary educational\r\nstandard. As a rule the Clericals refused to participate in the\r\nreferendum.\r\n\r\nIn Brussels, out of 72,465 entitled to vote only 38,217 voted, with\r\nthe following results: manhood suffrage at twenty-one years, 29,949;\r\nmanhood suffrage at twenty-five years, 5,253; all other propositions\r\ntogether, 3,015. In Huy, out of 3,513 voters only 1,800 voted, and\r\n1,700 of these were in favor of universal suffrage. In Antwerp, where\r\nLiberals and Clericals are about evenly divided, only forty-three per\r\ncent. of the electors voted, and of 18,701 votes cast, 15,704 were for\r\nuniversal suffrage.\r\n\r\nThis referendum, and all the demonstrations, had very little effect\r\nupon parliament. The deputies were in favor of revision, but could not\r\nagree upon a plan. The Radicals were in favor of universal suffrage,\r\nthe Clericals unalterably opposed to it, and the Liberals only\r\nsympathetic towards it.\r\n\r\nFinally, in April, all the proposals were voted down by the Chamber of\r\nRepresentatives. The Socialists immediately ordered a general strike.\r\n\r\nIt began in the coal mines of Hainault, spread to the weavers and\r\nspinners of Ghent, to the glass and iron works of the Walloon\r\ndistricts, to the printers and pressmen of Brussels, and to the docks\r\nat Antwerp. Two hundred thousand men stopped work in the course of a\r\nfew days. While the mills and mines were idle the police and soldiers\r\nwere busy. Six men were killed at Joliment, six killed and twelve\r\nwounded at Mons. In Brussels the mob pried up the paving-stones for\r\nweapons; the city guards patrolled the city, meetings were forbidden,\r\nthe streets were cleared of people, and the mayor was wounded in a\r\nmelee. A band of \"communists\" threw a barricade across Rue des\r\nEperonniers, the last of the barricades. The troops made short work of\r\nit. Scores of arrests were made in the various cities and the\r\noffenders received sentences varying from six years' imprisonment to a\r\nfine of fifty francs.\r\n\r\nIn the height of the excitement the Chamber of Representatives\r\nconvened and agreed upon a franchise amendment. Immediately the\r\ngeneral council of the Labor Party met and declared the strike off. It\r\nsent out this pronouncement: \"The Labor Party through its general\r\ncouncil records the insertion of manhood suffrage in the Constitution.\r\nIt declares that this first victory of the party has been won under\r\npressure of a general strike. It is resolved to persist in the work of\r\npropaganda until it has won universal political equality and has\r\nsuppressed the plural voting privilege.\"\r\n\r\nThe new electoral law (1893) was a compromise suggested by Professor\r\nAlbert Nyssens of the University of Louvain. It recognized the three\r\nprincipal demands of the three parliamentary factions: universal\r\nsuffrage of the Radicals, property qualifications of the Clericals,\r\nand educational qualifications of the Liberals. Universal suffrage was\r\ngranted to all male citizens twenty-five years of age. But this was\r\nmodified in favor of property and education by the granting of\r\nadditional votes. One additional vote was give (1) to every voter\r\nthirty-five years of age who was the head of a family and paid a\r\ndirect tax of 5 francs (one dollar); (2) to every owner of real\r\nproperty valued at 2,000 francs ($400.00), or who had an annual income\r\nof 200 francs ($40.00) derived from investments in the Belgian public\r\nfunds. Two additional votes were given to the holders of diplomas from\r\nthe higher schools, to those who were or had been in public office,\r\nand to those who practised a profession for which a higher education\r\nwas necessary. No one was allowed more than three votes.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be said of this fancy franchise, it is at least\r\ningenious. It satisfied the first popular hunger after the ballot. The\r\nworkmen could vote. The conditions imposed for the casting of two\r\nvotes seem very liberal and the majority of American voters could\r\nqualify under them. But in Belgium, the land of low wages and\r\ncongested populations, they were real barricades. Nearly two-thirds of\r\nthe voters failed to reach even this low standard.\r\n\r\nVoting made compulsory. Election was by _scrutin de liste_.[5]\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nUnder these conditions the Socialists went into battle. There were\r\n1,370,687 electors; 855,628 with one vote 293,678 with two votes,\r\n223,380 with three votes. The Socialists polled 346,000 votes, the\r\nClericals 927,000, the Liberals 530,000. The new parliament was\r\ncomposed as follows: Chamber of Representatives--Clericals, 104;\r\nLiberals, 19; Socialists, 29; Senate--Clericals 71; Liberals, 21;\r\nSocialists, 2.[6]\r\n\r\nFrom the first the Socialists in Belgium have not been reluctant in\r\nmaking election arrangements with other parties. In this their first\r\nelection they united with the Progressists. In Brussels on the second\r\nballot they proposed terms to the Liberals, which were refused. The\r\nSocialists, however, instructed their followers to vote against the\r\nClericals in every instance. Wherever there were no Radical or\r\nSocialists lists they supported the Liberals.[7]\r\n\r\nThe same widespread alarm that the first Socialist parliamentary\r\naccessions aroused everywhere, was caused by these twenty-nine Belgian\r\nSocialist representatives, especially as some of their number were\r\npromoted from prison to parliament, and one striker was given his\r\nliberty for the time being so that he could attend the session.\r\nVandervelde allayed popular apprehension when he announced the program\r\nof his party, which combined with the usual labor legislation the\r\ndemand for the state purchase of coal mines, state monopoly of the\r\nliquor business, and communal election reforms. The proposals of the\r\nBelgian Socialists in parliament have invariably been practical, not\r\nrevolutionary or visionary. One of the first bills introduced by them\r\nprovided for the reduction of the stamp tax and the tax on the\r\ntransfer of property and leases. This tax was extremely high, nearly\r\nseven per cent., and worked a peculiar hardship on the small tenant.\r\nThe bill failed of passage. But the government was so impressed by the\r\nfacts presented in debate that it brought in a law reducing the tax on\r\ntransfers for all small estates.\r\n\r\nIt is by this indirect method, by their presence in the Chamber, and\r\nby their powers in debate that the Belgian Socialists have achieved\r\nmany practical reforms. They have not the hauteur and aloofness of\r\nthe German Social Democrat, nor the fiery passion for idealistic\r\npropaganda of the French; they are more sensible than either. Since\r\ntheir entrance into parliament a Secretary of Labor has been added to\r\nthe cabinet, and every department of labor legislation has felt their\r\ninfluence. The delegation is in constant touch with the party in the\r\nvarious districts. An old-age pension act has been passed, great\r\nreductions have been made in military expenditure, the conscript laws\r\nhave been modified, and the Socialists led in the opposition to the\r\nBelgian policy in the Congo.\r\n\r\nTheir two main contentions have been over the educational laws and the\r\nelectoral laws. A school law was passed by the Clericals in 1895. It\r\nwas regarded as reactionary by the Socialists, and stormy scenes\r\naccompanied its enactment. Its provisions are still the source of\r\nconstant agitation among Socialists and Liberals. They protest\r\nespecially against the teaching of religion in the communal schools.\r\nIt is true that any parent may have his child excused from attending\r\nsuch instruction for reasons of conscience on written application to\r\nthe proper authorities. But they insist that this subjects the\r\nobjecting parent to harsh treatment in Clerical communities.[8]\r\n\r\nThe provincial and communal election laws were less favorable to the\r\nSocialists than the national law. In 1895 the government brought in a\r\nnew local election bill which fixed the voting age at thirty,\r\nrequired three years' residence in a commune, and strengthened the\r\nplural voting system by giving a fourth vote to the large\r\nland-holders. The Socialists and Radicals united in contesting 507 of\r\nthe communes (about one-fourth of the whole number). They won a\r\nmajority in eighty and a considerable minority in 180 of these\r\ncommunal councils. Necessity had cemented the alliance of Radicals and\r\nSocialists. The Radicals were now called \"_Chevre-choutiers_\" because\r\nthey tried to carry the goat and the cabbage, Liberals and Socialists,\r\nacross the stream in the same boat.\r\n\r\nIn 1899 the government brought in its new election bill in which it\r\nproposed to concede to the demand for proportional representation. But\r\nonly the large constituencies were to be included in the change,\r\nleaving the smaller districts, mostly in the Flemish section, to the\r\nClerical majorities that prevailed there. The measure was unpopular.\r\nThe people organized protests against it in every city in the land. In\r\nBrussels a mob gathered in front of the Chamber of Deputies.\r\nPaving-stones were ripped up and hurled through the windows, and there\r\nwas charging and counter-charging between police and populace. Inside\r\nthe Chamber the scene was not less tumultuous. The Socialists tried to\r\nprevent business by mob tactics. Desk-lids were banged, there was\r\nshouting and singing, one deputy had provided himself with a horn. The\r\ngovernment was compelled to adjourn the session. All that night (June\r\n28) there was rioting in Brussels. When the Chamber met the following\r\nday the wild scenes were re-enacted, when a Clerical deputy moved that\r\nany member causing a disturbance be expelled. In the debate that\r\nfollowed the government declared itself willing to adjourn and study\r\nthe various proposals of the opposition. This cooled the crowd waiting\r\noutside the Chamber, and at Vandervelde's suggestion the mob quietly\r\ndispersed.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the mayors of Brussels, Ghent, Antwerp, and Liege\r\nwaited on the King and told him they would no longer be responsible\r\nfor the maintenance of order in their cities if the minister did not\r\nwithdraw the obnoxious electoral bill. The Liberals now joined the\r\nSocialists and Radicals in their processions in every town, singing\r\ntheir war-songs and carrying placards and banners of protest.\r\n\r\nAll this had its effect on the government. A committee representing\r\nall the groups in the Chamber was appointed to consider all the\r\nproposals that had been introduced. Vandervelde, in supporting the\r\ncommittee, said that he \"spoke for the country that had so effectively\r\ndemonstrated its power and achieved a victory.\" Soon after this the\r\nreactionary ministry fell, and the new government brought in a bill\r\nproviding uniform proportional representation for all the districts.\r\nThis bill was promptly enacted into law.\r\n\r\nThe first general election under this law resulted as follows:\r\n\r\n  Total vote cast          2,105,270\r\n  Socialists                467,326, electing 32 deputies.\r\n  Clericals                 995,056      \"    85    \"\r\n  Liberals                  449,521      \"    31    \"\r\n  Radicals                   47,783      \"     3    \"\r\n  Christian Democrats        55,737      \"     1    \"\r\n\r\nThe Clerical majority was cut from seventy to eighteen and at last the\r\nLiberal elements were hopeful of gaining the government and effecting\r\nuniversal suffrage \"pure and simple.\"\r\n\r\nWe have now seen how popular agitation wrested, first, a law\r\npermitting plural voting; second, a law permitting proportional\r\nrepresentation, from an unwilling government. The contest for\r\nuniversal suffrage \"pure and simple\" has continued to the present day.\r\nIn 1901 the Labor Party at its congress at Liege decided to renew the\r\nagitation in favor of universal suffrage, \"even to the extent of the\r\ngeneral strike, and agitation in the streets, and not to cease until\r\nafter the conquest of political equality.\" Vandervelde introduced a\r\nbill into the Chamber providing for \"one man, one vote,\" and it was\r\ndefeated by a vote of 92 to 43. Immediately Vandervelde and the\r\nRadical leader proposed a revision of the Constitution. The debate on\r\nthis motion continued until the spring of 1902. All the old spirit of\r\nunrest and violence broke out anew. To the violence of protesting mobs\r\nwas added the coercive force of the general strike. Three hundred\r\nthousand men stopped work and began demonstrating. Troops were called\r\nout to guard the government buildings in Brussels and to hold the\r\ncrowds at bay in the provinces. In Louvain eight strikers were killed\r\nby the soldiers, and in other localities there was bloodshed and\r\ndestruction of property.\r\n\r\nFinally the Chamber of Representatives voted to close the debate and\r\ndismiss the question entirely for the session. The strike was declared\r\noff and quiet restored.\r\n\r\nIn the elections the following May the Socialists lost three seats.\r\nThis had its effect. A meeting of the party was called and it was\r\ndecided not to resort to further violence. A delegate from Charleroi,\r\nthe seat of the most tumultuous element in the party, expressed regret\r\nthat the Labor Party had compromised with the bourgeois parties in\r\ncalling off the strike. Vandervelde defended the action of the council\r\non the ground that the continuance of the strike threatened internal\r\ndissensions because of the misery of the strikers and the violence of\r\nthe government.\r\n\r\nThe party organ, _Le Peuple_, said on June 5, 1902: \"We are no longer\r\nin 1848. The days of barricades have gone by. The narrow little\r\nstreets of former years have expanded into wide avenues. The soldiers\r\nare armed with Albinis and Mausers. Even if all the people were armed\r\nit would only be necessary to plant a few cannon at strategic places\r\nin the city to put down an insurrection in spite of the greatest\r\nheroism of the insurgents.\"[9]\r\n\r\nVan Overbergh, in his history of the strike, says: \"The period of\r\nromantic Socialism in Belgium is past; the days of realism have\r\ncommenced.\"[10] And Bertrand, the historian, adds the reason: \"Its [the\r\ngeneral strike's] effect was to keep down the vote. Even in the\r\nelections of 1904 and 1906 the vote has remained quite stationary.\"[11]\r\n\r\nWhether this means the apotheosis of the general strike in Belgium\r\nwill depend no doubt upon circumstances, it is significant that the\r\nwords were uttered, and still more significant that political\r\ncoalition has taken the place of industrial warfare. The Liberals and\r\nRadicals now plan with the Socialists. They no longer stand aside and\r\nlet the Socialists march, but they join step with them and carry\r\nbanners.\r\n\r\nThe greatest of all Belgian demonstrations for universal suffrage and\r\nfree schools took place in August, 1911. In spite of the extreme\r\nheat, nearly 200,000 Radicals, Liberals, and Socialists gathered in\r\nthe capital, \"not so much to impress the government,\" a Socialist\r\nleader said to me, \"but to impress the people that we are in earnest,\r\nand then to prepare for the coming elections.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nIt must not be inferred from this rapid survey of its warfare for\r\npolitical privilege that Belgian Socialism has forgotten the\r\nco-operative movement and all the various activities that were blended\r\nin the making of the Labor Party. Belgian Socialism is primarily\r\neconomic. This makes it unique. It has succeeded in becoming economic,\r\nin building dairies and bake-shops, in running dry-goods stores and\r\ngrocery stores and butcher shops, in the present dispensation; and it\r\nhas succeeded in doing so by accommodating itself to the present\r\nconditions. It adopts the eight-hour day when it can, but it is not\r\naverse to ten hours when necessary. It pays its employees the highest\r\nwage it can, but it recognizes talent and ability like the bourgeois\r\nshopkeeper across the street. It has insurance funds that draw\r\ninterest at the same rate that is paid by bourgeois banks, and it has\r\nno scruples about putting the latest approved machinery into its\r\nworkshops and bakeries.\r\n\r\nIn all this, their activities have remained Socialistic. They compete\r\nwith the bourgeois, but co-operate among themselves. The profits of\r\ntheir activities go to the members of their societies and to the\r\nparty. Their competition has brought ruin to the door of many a\r\nshopkeeper who finds his customers flocking to their own shop.\r\nGovernment commissions have inquired into the movement at the nervous\r\nrequests of merchants and tradesmen, but only to find every\r\nco-operative enterprise carefully conducted and thriving.\r\n\r\nThe Belgian Socialist leaders all emphasize the importance of this\r\nunity of economic and political activity, and the priority of the\r\neconomic over the political. It has been a splendid stimulant for the\r\nBelgian workman. It has aroused him out of the lethargy that has been\r\nhis greatest enemy for years. It has taught him to work with others,\r\nthe value of mass movement, the futility of separateness. It has\r\nschooled him, not only in reading and arithmetic, in the night classes\r\nestablished everywhere; but in business, in weights and measures; in\r\npercentage, in profit and loss; and most of all, in the real hardships\r\nthat meet tradespeople and commercial men everywhere in their endeavor\r\nto get on. Workingmen often think that a business man is a necromancer\r\njuggling profits out of other people's necessities. The Belgian\r\nco-operativist has found out that trading is a commonplace and tedious\r\ntask which requires constant alertness and is merely the drudgery of\r\ndetail. This experience has taught him, moreover, the futility of laws\r\nand the utility of effort. In Belgium I was impressed most of all by\r\nthe nonchalance, almost contempt, that the workman displays toward\r\nmere legislation. \"Why should I toy with words when I have this?\" And\r\nhe points proudly to his co-operative store.\r\n\r\nThe Belgian workman has been taught through his co-operative\r\nexperience the value of patient toil and frugality. Slowly he has\r\nbuilt up these institutions out of his own savings. When he thought\r\nhis scant wages were barely enough for bread, he discovered means\r\nsomehow to pay his dues in the \"Mutualite.\" As an instance of his\r\nthrift, he saves every year a little fund which is used by the family\r\nfor an annual holiday, usually a short excursion to a neighboring\r\nplace of interest. Every member of the family contributes to this\r\nfund, and, no matter how poor, they look forward to their yearly\r\nholiday.\r\n\r\nThe Belgian Socialist has also been successful in another field. While\r\nin other countries the Socialists have tried usually in vain to lure\r\nthe peasant and small farmer, the Belgians have made constant progress\r\nin this direction. The agrarian movement began with the organizing of\r\nthe Labor Party.[12]\r\n\r\nVandervelde and Hector Dennis, a Professor of Economics in the\r\nUniversity at Brussels, have been constant in their zeal for the\r\nagrarian interests. Again, the lure is not Socialism in the abstract,\r\nnor the gospel of discontent. It is practical, business co-operation.\r\nDairies, stores, markets are proving powerful propagandists, even in\r\nthe Catholic lowlands. Dr. Steffens-Frauenweiler quotes from a\r\nconservative newspaper: \"From different sides we have heard the remark\r\nthat Socialism would never penetrate into the country. In\r\ncontradiction to this opinion we must observe that those who express\r\nthis view, and presume to laugh away the Socialistic movement among\r\nthe peasants and farmers, are either not well informed or are\r\nsubmitting themselves to illusions. Only a serious attempt to fight\r\nSocialism through positive reforms will prove a lasting check upon the\r\nambitions of Socialists.\"[13]\r\n\r\nIn Belgium the general strike has been used as an aid in the warfare\r\nfor political power. We have seen how the first strike was premature,\r\nthe second effective, and the third proved a boomerang in its reaction\r\nupon the Labor Party.\r\n\r\nVandervelde distinguishes between the general strike as a means toward\r\nsocial revolution, and the general strike as a political weapon used\r\nfor securing a _definite_ object.[14] He says: \"The revolutionary\r\ngeneral strike is itself the revolution. The reformist general strike,\r\non the contrary, is the attempt of the proletariat to secure partial\r\nconcessions from the government without questioning the existence of\r\nthe government, and especially the administration that represents the\r\ngovernment.\" To effect this, it is not essential that all the workmen\r\ngo out, but only enough to interrupt \"the normal course of business,\r\neven if the majority of the workers remain at work.\"[15]\r\n\r\nThe political general strike has its example, then, in the Belgian\r\nmovement for the electoral franchise. Whether it would succeed in\r\nwresting other political privileges from the state, is conjecture;\r\nthat it would not succeed except under the most favorable conditions,\r\nis certain.\r\n\r\nThe Belgian movement has displayed great absorptive powers and\r\nfacility of adaptation. It has absorbed all the labor activities of\r\nthe Radical and Socialist workmen. It has adapted itself to the\r\nnecessities of the hour, giving up the daydreams of intangible things.\r\nIn all this, it has displayed a saneness, in spite of its\r\nrevolutionary traditions and anarchistic blood.[16] It has the most\r\n\"modern\" program of the European Socialist parties, and the most\r\nworldly efficiency.\r\n\r\nIn visiting one of the large workingmen's clubhouses found in the\r\ncities, the visitor is impressed with the beehive qualities of the\r\nBelgian movement. At the \"Maison du Peuple\" in Brussels--that was\r\nbuilt by these underpaid workmen at a cost of 1,000,000 francs--you\r\nfind activity everywhere. The savings-bank department is swarming with\r\nwomen and children, come to conduct the business of the family. The\r\ncafe, the headquarters of the party, the offices of the co-operative\r\nsocieties, all are busy. In the evening there are debates, gymnasium\r\ncontests, moving-picture shows, classes for instruction in the\r\nelementary branches, in art, and literature.[17] A temperance\r\nmovement, started by the workmen some years ago, has attained a great\r\ndeal of influence. Placards are on the walls of the clubhouses,\r\nsetting forth the evils of the drink habit.\r\n\r\nOr you visit a co-operative bakery or butcher-shop or grocery store,\r\nand the same spirit of diligence, thrift, and reasonableness is there.\r\nAnd you are quite convinced that here is Socialism approximating\r\nsomewhere near its ultimate form. If the Belgian Labor Party should\r\nsecure control of the government to-morrow it would be more competent\r\nto assume the actual obligations of power than would the Socialists in\r\nany other European country. For they have not built a structure in\r\nmid-air, with merely an underpinning of more or less indifferent\r\ntheories.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] _L'Enquete Gouvernementale_, Vol. XVIII.\r\n\r\n[2] _L'Annuaire Statistique._\r\n\r\n[3] BERTRAND, _Histoire de la Democratie et du Socialisme en Belgique\r\ndepuis 1830_, Vol II, p. 331.\r\n\r\n[4] This conference sent the following telegram to the King: \"You have\r\nasked what is the watchword of the country; the watchword is universal\r\nsuffrage.\"\r\n\r\n[5] The candidates are arranged in groups or \"lists,\" and the voter\r\nvotes the list as well as for the individual names on the list.

But the loyalty to the Church\r\nremains undiminished. On May 17, 1901, a Clerical deputy remarked in\r\nthe Chamber that he would like to see the temporal power of the pope\r\nrestored. The Socialists immediately started an uproar which ended in\r\ntheir singing their \"Marseillaise\" and the adjournment of the sitting.\r\n\r\n[9] BERTRAND, _Histoire_, II, p. 590.\r\n\r\n[10] _La Greve Generale Belge d'Avril_, 1902, Brussels, 1902.\r\n\r\n[11] _Histoire_, II, p. 592.\r\n\r\n[12] See DR.

One of them, with\r\nsincere indignation, pointed out to me the large pile of stone that\r\nsurmounts the heights of the city, the Palace of Justice, completed in\r\n1883, and said its \"bourgeois Babylonian hideousness is the high-water\r\nmark of bourgeois taste in art and bourgeois power in politics.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE GERMAN SOCIAL DEMOCRACY\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nIt is the constant complaint of the German Democrats that there is no\r\nLiberal Party in Germany. The wars that repeatedly devastated the\r\ncountry during past centuries drove property owners to seek the\r\nprotection of a strong, centralized government. This habit has\r\nsurvived the centuries. Whenever the middle classes show signs of\r\nbreaking away from the conservatism of the \"Regierung,\" the Prince\r\nalways finds a way of bringing them back. The Period of\r\nRevolution--1850--ended in a compromise that ignored the workingmen\r\nand virtually left absolutism on the throne. When the new era dawned,\r\nand Bismarck, like a young giant, shaped the highways of empire, he\r\nused the Liberals so adroitly that, when his national legerdemain was\r\naccomplished, they were a broken and impotent faction, lost in the\r\nconservative reaction of the hour.\r\n\r\nUniversal suffrage for the Reichstag elections was written into the\r\nConstitution of the new empire, not because the Chancellor and his\r\nPrince loved democracy, but because the smaller states insisted upon\r\nthis safeguard against Prussian omnipotence.\r\n\r\nDemocracy and Liberalism have never been strong enough to break the\r\nfetters of national habit; and nearly all the democracy, certainly all\r\nthe workingman's democracy, in Germany to-day is found in the Social\r\nDemocratic Party.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the development of Social Democracy in Germany,\r\nit is necessary to bear in mind the bureaucratic, autocratic,\r\npaternalistic character of the German government.[1]\r\n\r\nIt is the German governmental policy to do everything for the welfare\r\nof its citizens that can be done; and, in return, it expects the\r\npeople to let the government alone. The medieval conception of class\r\nresponsibility survives. It is the attitude of a self-righteous parent\r\ntoward ignorant and wilful children. The government assumes the right,\r\nand possesses the power, to regulate every phase of the citizen's\r\nlife, in domestic, industrial, educational, moral, and political\r\naffairs. It is a regal survival of the theory that government is\r\nomniscient, omnipotent, and omnipresent.\r\n\r\nGermany is a made-to-order country that clings to medieval\r\nconservatism in government; a country that is thoroughly modern in\r\nindustry and distinctly middle-age in caste; where the workingman has\r\nalways been treated with patronizing condescension and his political\r\nacts watched with jealousy; and where he has, against great odds,\r\ndetermined to work out his own salvation. Surrounded by preordained\r\nand rigid conditions, he has perfected an organization that is the\r\nmost remarkable example of proletarian achievement found anywhere in\r\nhistory. To the development and description of this organization we\r\nwill now address ourselves.\r\n\r\nGerman Social Democracy, while Marxian in theory, owes its active\r\nexistence to Ferdinand Lassalle, one of those brilliant and daring\r\ngeniuses who flash, in an hour of adventure, across the prosaic days\r\nof history.[2] He was pronounced a _Wunderkind_ by William von\r\nHumboldt; dashed his way through university routine; attracted the\r\nfriendship of poets, philosophers, and politicians; was lionized by\r\nsociety; became a revolutionist in 1848, and was, at the age of\r\ntwenty-three, indicted for inciting a mob of Duesseldorf workingmen to\r\nacts of violence. He defended himself in a brilliant speech which\r\nlaunched him fully into the campaign of the workingman.[3]\r\n\r\nEarly in his career he volunteered to defend the cause of the Countess\r\nHatzfeldt, whose unfaithful husband was squandering his estates and\r\nsuffering her to live in want. Lassalle fought the case through\r\nthirty-six courts for nine years, and won an ample fortune for the\r\ncountess, who became the main financial support of Lassalle's\r\ncampaigns.\r\n\r\nAfter his first arrest, Lassalle was kept under vigilance by the\r\ngovernment. But finally, through the interposition of distinguished\r\nfriends, he was allowed to return to Berlin. There, in 1862, he\r\ndelivered a series of addresses that soon brought him into conflict\r\nwith the police. His defense in the court was published later under\r\nthe title, _Science and the Workingman_. This he followed with a\r\nletter, _Might and Right_,[4] sent broadcast over the land.\r\n\r\nIn these two publications he succinctly enunciated his theory of\r\ndemocracy: \"With Democracy alone dwells right, and in Democracy alone\r\nwill might be found. No person in the Prussian state to-day has the\r\nright to speak of 'rights,' except the Democracy, the old and true\r\nDemocracy. For Democracy alone has constantly clung to the right, and\r\nhas never lowered herself by compromising with might.\"[5]\r\n\r\nIn the political turmoil of that period, when new forces were\r\nawakening to their power and feudalism, conservatism, Cobdenism, and\r\ndemocracy were all contending for supremacy, there were three\r\npredominating currents of thought. The first was naturally the feudal,\r\nthe absolutist that would put down by the police power, and failing in\r\nthat by the soldiery, every attempt at changing the organization of\r\nthe government. This was embodied in the reactionary, or Conservative\r\nParty, which held then, as it still does, the high places in army and\r\ngovernment. Bismarck was its leader. It had ample nationalist aims,\r\nand was called the \"Great German Party\" (\"Gross Deutschland\"); Austria\r\nwas included in its ambitions, and monarchic supremacy was the token\r\nof its power. It comprised the landowners, the nobles, and the\r\nagrarians.\r\n\r\nThe second tendency was commercial, bourgeois. It found expression in\r\nthe National Liberal Party, which was liberal in name only. It was the\r\n\"Small German\" (\"Klein Deutschland\") Party, preferring the ascendency\r\nof Prussia. It comprised the enterprising traders, manufacturers, and\r\nbankers, and was strongest in the cities. It was attached to monarchy,\r\ncared little for military or political glory, except as it affected\r\ntrade and taxes.\r\n\r\nThe third tendency had nothing in common with the other two. It was\r\nthe revolt of the proletarians, led by men of great ability. It was\r\nthe democratic movement. It abhorred both the idea of feudal\r\nprerogative in government, as expressed by king and noble, and the\r\nvulgar trade patriotism, as expressed by the National Liberals, the\r\nbourgeoisie. It took its inspiration from France and its example from\r\nEngland. From France came the political platitudes of equality and\r\nliberty with which we are familiar in America; from England, the\r\nexample of strongly organized trade unions. In Germany these two\r\nmovements, economic and political, were blended into one.\r\n\r\nNot that the workingman's movement was a unity. Schultze-Delitsch, the\r\nfounder of the German co-operative movement, contended that labor\r\nshould keep out of politics and devote itself to economic activities\r\nalone. Rodbertus, the distinguished economist, who was potent in\r\nshaping economic and political thought in Germany, wrote Lassalle,\r\nwhen he was entreated to join the brilliant agitator's propaganda,\r\nthat he could \"tolerate no political agitation which would excite the\r\nworking classes against the existing executive power.\"[6]\r\n\r\nThere was no unity in the theories of the workingman's movement. The\r\nfirst organizations, the \"Workingmen's Associations,\" were founded\r\nsoon after 1848, as soon as the laws gave a limited right of\r\nassociation to the working class. The government looked with suspicion\r\non every political act of labor, and especially upon organizations for\r\npolitical purposes. The ban of the law was put upon those\r\norganizations in July, 1854, and the right of public meeting was\r\ngreatly restricted; police autonomy increased, giving them arbitrary\r\npower to stop meetings; and the right of free press was virtually\r\ndenied. Democracy became a movement of silent intrigue and occasional\r\nrough outbreak.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture a new political party was organized, to absorb what\r\nwas \"legal\" in the democratic workingman's movement and what was truly\r\nliberal in the National Liberal Party. The new party was called\r\nProgressist (\"Fortschrittler\"). It was a German party, devoted to the\r\nManchester doctrine: Free commerce, free trade, free press, free\r\nspeech; freedom of expression in every phase of human activity. It was\r\n_laissez-faire_ to the uttermost plunged into the reactionary mass of\r\nGerman politics. The economic issue became freedom of contract\r\n_versus_ feudal status; the political issue, freedom of ballot\r\n_versus_ hereditary prerogative.\r\n\r\nThe new party began to appeal for the workingman's support. Their lure\r\nof free speech and freedom of organization was not without effect. The\r\nolder workingmen, who were not familiar with the teachings of Marx and\r\nEngels, and who had not even read Weitling's communistic\r\nidealizations, were brought, in some numbers, into the new party.\r\n\r\nThe younger and more radical element in the workingmen's clubs were\r\nrestless. In 1862 some of them had visited the International\r\nExposition in London and had talked with Marx. The fire of the\r\n\"International\" was kindled. A movement for calling a national\r\nworkingman's convention was started among these radicals. The\r\nProgressists tried to check the agitation, saying that every effort\r\nshould be directed toward establishing a new Constitution. But it was\r\nin vain. In Leipsic a group of radicals seceded from the Workingman's\r\nUnion (Arbeiter Bildungs-Verein), and formed a new organization, which\r\nthey called \"Vorwaerts\" (Progress). These now invited Lassalle to\r\naddress them on his views of the labor situation.\r\n\r\nThe movement was opportune, and Lassalle's answer is the basic\r\ndocument of present-day Social Democracy.[7]\r\n\r\nThere is no salvation for the workingman except through \"political\r\nfreedom,\" he says. This freedom demands laws, and to secure laws\r\nunited action is essential. They must be powerful enough to get laws\r\nto their liking. This power they will not get by being an appendix to\r\nthe Progressists, for they are dominated by a trade doctrine, not by\r\naltruistic ideals for the oppressed.\r\n\r\nWith a clearness that has not been excelled, he showed the dependence\r\nof economic upon political power and influence. His economic program\r\nwas none other than Louis Blanc's state-subsidized workshops. It made\r\nno great impression and soon faded away. But his bold plan of a\r\nworkingman's party fighting fiercely for democracy, and for the\r\nbetterment of the \"normal conditions of the entire working classes,\"\r\nhas been developed to surprising perfection.\r\n\r\nThe state, he says, must be the instrument of their power, not the\r\nobject of their striving. They are in politics, not as politicians,\r\nbut as proletarians. \"The state is nothing but the great organization,\r\nthe all-embracing association of the working classes.\" No \"sustaining\r\nand helping hand\" will be their guide. Political supremacy is the\r\n\"only way out of the desert.\" And how win the state? There is only one\r\nway: through universal suffrage, democracy. \"Universal suffrage is not\r\nonly your political but also your social foundation principle, the\r\ncondition precedent of all social help. It is the only means for\r\nbettering the material conditions of the working classes.\"\r\n\r\nCut loose from Rodbertus economically, and from the Progressists\r\npolitically, Lassalle was invited to take the leadership of the new\r\nmovement, which from the start was political rather than economic. He\r\naimed to organize the German workingmen into a great national party,\r\nso powerful that it could control governments, make laws, and demand\r\nobedience. But it was slow work, and to the fiery spirit of Lassalle\r\nits snail's pace was exasperating. It provoked him into violence of\r\nspeech which led him everywhere into the courts and into constant\r\naltercations with the Crown's solicitors.\r\n\r\nHis powerful personality and unusually active mind made a profound\r\nimpression everywhere. At the last conference of his association which\r\nhe attended he claimed the Bishop of Mayence and the King of Prussia\r\nas converts. The Bishop, Baron von Ketteler, was indeed turning toward\r\nSocialism, but not Lassalle's political Socialism. He was the founder\r\nof that Christian Socialism which has made the Catholic Church in\r\nSouth Germany and the Rhineland a potent factor in the labor movement.\r\nThe King, whose conversion Lassalle boldly announced, had only\r\nreceived a delegation of Silesian weavers who laid their grievances\r\nbefore him and were promised the royal sympathy.\r\n\r\nHowever, Lassalle and Bismarck had formed a general liking for each\r\nother, and the great minister received from the brilliant agitator\r\nmany suggestions which he later embodied in his state insurance laws.\r\nBoth Bismarck and Lassalle believed in the power of the state for the\r\namelioration of social conditions. They met several times at the\r\nChancellor's solicitation, and Bismarck disclosed their conversations\r\nto the Reichstag, on the insistence of Bebel, when the insurance bills\r\nwere under discussion. The Chancellor expressed his admiration for the\r\nvirility of the Socialist's mind and said he believed Lassalle\r\nperfectly sincere in his purpose.[8]\r\n\r\nLassalle did not live to see his General Workingmen's Association\r\n(\"Allgemeiner Deutscher Arbeitsverein\") attain political power. He was\r\nkilled in a duel over a love affair August 31, 1864. His brilliant\r\ncampaign for democracy had resulted in a petty organization of 4,610\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\nLassalle's influence is increasing every year. His death-day is\r\ncelebrated by the German Socialists (Lassalle Feier). The present-day\r\nGerman movement is Lassallian rather than Marxian.[9]\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Rodbertus, February, 1864, Lassalle says that he aimed\r\nto show the workingman \"how identical the economic and the political\r\nforces are. Every separation of them is an abstraction, and I believe\r\nthat uniting the two is the principal potency which I can give to the\r\ncause.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe little handful was soon rent by internal strife and threatened\r\nwith utter extinction, both by police aggression and by Marxian\r\ncompetition. The year Lassalle died the International Workingman's\r\nAssociation was organized and agitation began in Germany under the\r\nleadership of William Liebknecht, a friend and disciple of Marx.\r\nLiebknecht was the scholar of the early Social Democratic group. He\r\npossessed a university education, was a revolutionist in 1848, a\r\nfugitive in Switzerland and England until 1862. His foreign sojourn\r\ndid not mellow his natural dogmatism; on the contrary, his long\r\nintercourse with Marx in London hardened his orthodoxy. He was a\r\npowerful polemist. However, alone he could not have organized a\r\nnational movement. He did not possess the personal traits that lure.\r\nHe made a notable convert when he won August Bebel, a Saxon\r\nwoodturner, to his cause. \"I was Saul and became Paul,\" Bebel said to\r\nme. The words are not inapt: his power is Pauline. Lie has been\r\npersecuted and imprisoned, has written speeches and epistles, has\r\nmade many missionary journeys, and kept constantly in intimate touch\r\nwith every local phase of his propaganda. His imprisonments have\r\nundermined his health, but they have not diminished his mental vigor;\r\nand more than once the Iron Chancellor winced under his ferocious\r\nassaults.\r\n\r\nLiebknecht and Bebel were more advanced than the Workingmen's\r\nAssociation, which now had fallen under the leadership of Schweitzer,\r\nan able but dissolute disciple of Lassalle. The two organizations\r\nfought each other as rivals. The international wing, under Liebknecht\r\nand Bebel, in 1869, organized the Democratic Workingmen's Party at\r\nEisenach, and were called \"Eisenachers.\" Their program is of great\r\nimportance. It stated that the first object of the new party was the\r\nattaining of the free state (Freier Volkstaat). This state Liebknecht\r\nexplained at his trial in 1872: \"The idea of a free state is\r\ninterpreted by a majority of our party to mean a republic; but does\r\nthis necessarily imply that it is to be forcibly introduced? No one\r\nhas expressed an opinion as to how it is to be introduced. Let a\r\nmajority of the people be won for our opinions, and the state is of\r\nour opinions, for the people are the state. A state without a king is\r\nconceivable, but not a state without a people. The government is the\r\nservant of the people.\"\r\n\r\nThis free state, the program continues, can be won only by political\r\nfreedom, and political freedom is the forerunner of economic freedom.\r\nDemand is therefore made for universal, equal, direct suffrage, with\r\nsecret ballot, for all men twenty years of age, in both parliamentary\r\nand municipal elections. Other leading demands were: direct\r\nlegislation; the abolition of all privileges, whether of birth,\r\nwealth, or religion; the establishment of militia in place of standing\r\narmies; the separation of Church and state; the secularizing of\r\neducation; the extension of free schools and compulsory education;\r\nreform of the courts and extension of the jury system; abolition of\r\nall laws restricting freedom of speech, of press, and of association;\r\nthe establishment of a normal workday; the restriction of female, and\r\nabolition of child, labor; the abolition of indirect taxes; the\r\nestablishment of an income and inheritance tax; the extension of state\r\ncredit for co-operative enterprises.\r\n\r\nThis program sounds very modern and moderate. But its expositors were\r\nnot restrained to moderation, and when the congress met at Dresden in\r\n1871 it adopted a resolution extolling the French Commune. A great\r\ndeal of popular sympathy was lost through this action.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Lassalle party was slowly gaining ground. In 1875 the\r\ntwo parties united at Gotha. There were 9,000 members in the\r\nLiebknecht party and 15,000 members in the Lassalle party. Here was\r\nadopted the first program of the united German Social Democracy. Its\r\neconomics are thoroughly Marxian in theory and are only slightly\r\ntinged by the teachings of Lassalle and Schultze-Delitsch in practice.\r\nLabor, it affirmed, was the source of all wealth and was held under\r\nduress by the capitalistic class. Its only emancipation could come\r\nfrom the social ownership of the means of production. The way to this\r\ngoal could be found through productive copartnership with state aid.\r\nThe political part of the program embraced the demands made at\r\nEisenach.\r\n\r\nWith its unity, a new vigor took possession of the party. Its\r\norganization was perfected; 145 agitators were in the field; its\r\ntwenty-three newspapers had over 100,000 subscribers. This meant\r\nincreased police vigilance. All the leaders served terms in prison,\r\nnewspapers were suppressed, organizations dissolved, houses searched,\r\nagitators ordered to leave the country. The government did everything\r\nin its power to suppress the movement. Every act of oppression\r\npopularized the Democracy among the proletarians. The blood of the\r\nmartyrs bore the usual harvest.\r\n\r\nThe new empire had been launched amidst the greatest enthusiasm,\r\nshared by every one except the discontented workingmen who had so\r\nstoutly fought for entire political freedom. The new imperial\r\nparliament was thrown open to them because Bismarck had found it\r\nnecessary to include universal suffrage in the constitution of the\r\nReichstag. In 1871 the Socialists elected two members, and the feudal\r\nlords beheld the novel sight of workingmen sitting with them in the\r\nimperial Diet. The voting strength of the party was 124,665. This was\r\nincreased to 351,952 in 1874, when nine members were elected. In 1877\r\nthe party cast 493,288 votes, electing twelve members. This was cause\r\nfor alarm. The party had now reached fifth place in point of votes\r\namong the fourteen parties or factions that contended for power in\r\nGermany, and eighth place in point of members elected. But in point of\r\nagitation, of perfervid speech and pointed interpellation, it ranked\r\neasily first. Its delegation in 1877 included Bebel and Liebknecht,\r\nnow out of jail, and Most, afterwards the notorious Anarchist in\r\nAmerica, and Hasselman and Bracke, who were not modest in the\r\nexpression of their opinions. These representatives of democracy let\r\nno occasion pass to embarrass the government with peppery questions.\r\n\r\nBismarck was slowly evolving a scheme for checking the Socialist\r\ngrowth and satisfying the demands of labor for better conditions. Both\r\nrevolved around the pivot of patriarchal omnipotence. The suppression\r\nwas to be accomplished by force; the gratification, by paternal rigor.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nHe addressed himself first to repression. He entreated the governments\r\nof Europe in 1871 to unite in stamping out Socialism, but he received\r\nno encouragement. In 1872 Spain, exasperated by the revolutionary\r\noutbreaks, addressed a circular to the Powers, asking their\r\nco-operation to check the growth of the revolutionary element.\r\nBismarck was ready. But Lord Granville, for England, said the\r\ntraditions of his country were favorable to an unrestricted right of\r\nresidence for foreigners as long as they violated no law of their\r\nhost. This ended the international attempt. Next (in 1874) Bismarck\r\nattempted to tighten the gag on the press, but the Reichstag refused\r\nto sanction his proposals. Then he fell back on existing legislation\r\nand with great vigor enforced the statutes against revolutionary\r\nactivity. The police were given wide latitude in interpreting these\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\nSeveral acts of wanton violence now occurred which brought about a\r\nsudden change of temper in the people. On May 11, 1878, while driving\r\nin Unter den Linden, Emperor William was shot at by a young man. The\r\nEmperor was not struck by the bullets, but the shots were none the\r\nless effective in rousing public indignation. Popular condemnation was\r\nturned against the Social Democrats because photographs of Liebknecht\r\nand Bebel were found on the person of the intended assassin. Two days\r\nlater Bismarck introduced the anti-Socialist laws. They were debated\r\nin the Reichstag, while Most was being tried for libeling the clergy.\r\nBut the Reichstag was not ready to go to the lengths of the\r\nChancellor's desire, and by a vote of 251 to 57 rejected his bill.\r\nHere the matter would have rested had not a second attempt been made\r\non the life of the aged Emperor. This occurred on June 2, and this\r\ntime the Emperor was seriously wounded.\r\n\r\nNaturally the indignation of the nation was thoroughly aroused. In the\r\nmidst of the excitement, a general election was held, and Bismarck\r\nwon. His own peculiar Conservatives increased their delegation from 40\r\nto 59, the Free Conservatives from 38 to 57; the National Liberals\r\nreduced their number from 128 to 99, the Liberals from 13 to 10, the\r\nProgressists from 35 to 26. The Socialists retained nine seats, losing\r\nthree; their vote fell from 493,288 to 437,158.\r\n\r\nImmediately a repressive law was introduced. It was called \"a law\r\nagainst the publicly dangerous activities of the Social Democracy\"\r\n(Gesetz gegen die gemein-gefaehrlichen Bestrebungen der\r\nSozial-Demokratie).[10]\r\n\r\nBismarck prefaced his law with a very clever prologue (Begruendung). In\r\nsimple language he arraigned the Social Democracy as being, first,\r\nanti-social, because it aims at the modern system of production, and\r\ndoes so, not through \"humanitarian motives,\" but through revolution;\r\nsecond, as anti-patriotic, because it makes \"the most odious attacks\"\r\non the German Empire. \"The law of preservation therefore compels the\r\nstate and society to oppose the Social Democratic movement with\r\ndecision.... True, thought cannot be repressed by external compulsion;\r\nthe movements of minds can only be overcome in intellectual combat.\r\nBut when movements take wrong pathways and threaten destruction, the\r\nmeans for their growth can and should be taken away by legal means.\r\nThe Socialist agitation, as carried on for years, is a continual\r\nappeal to violence and to the passions of the multitudes, for the\r\npurpose of subverting the social order. The state _can_ check such a\r\nmovement by depriving Social Democracy of its principal means of\r\npropaganda, and by destroying its organization; and it _must_ do so\r\nunless it is willing to surrender its existence, and unless the\r\nconviction is to spread amongst the people that either the state is\r\nimpossible or the aims of Social Democracy are justifiable.[11]\r\n\r\nThe law was passed against the vehement protest of the Socialists.\r\nThey disclaimed any connection with the dastardly attempts on the life\r\nof the aged Emperor. Bebel, in an impressive speech, declared that\r\nwhile Socialists do \"wish to abolish the present form of private\r\nproperty in the factors of production, labor, and land,\" they had\r\nnever been guilty of destroying a penny's worth of property. Nor did\r\nthey aim to do so. It was the system of private ownership of great\r\nproperties, that enabled a few to oppress the many, that they were\r\nfighting. And here they were in good company: Rodbertus, Rosher,\r\nWagner, Schaeffle, Brentano, Schmoller, and a host of other scholars\r\nand economists, Bebel affirmed, were Socialistic in their tendencies.\r\n\r\nBismarck was unyielding. He said he would welcome any real effort to\r\nalleviate harsh conditions. But the Socialists were a party of\r\ndestruction and were enemies to mankind.\r\n\r\nThe leader of the Progressists said, \"I fear Social Democracy more\r\nunder this law than without it.\" The vote of 221 to 149 in favor of\r\nthe law showed the grim Chancellor's sway over the assembly.\r\n\r\nThe law made clean work of it. It forbade all organizations which\r\npromulgated views controvening the existing social and political\r\norder. It prohibited the collecting of money for campaign purposes;\r\nput the ban on meetings, processions, and demonstrations; on\r\npublications of all kinds, confiscating the existing stock of\r\nprohibited books; and created a status akin to martial law by endowing\r\nthe police authorities with the power of declaring a locality in a\r\n\"minor state of siege,\" and exercising arbitrary authority for one\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nA commission was appointed by the Chancellor to carry out these\r\ninquisitions, and the war between Socialistic democracy and medieval\r\nautocracy was on. Its events are instructive to every government; its\r\nsequel a warning to all nations.[12]\r\n\r\nThe government organized its commission; the Socialists met at Hamburg\r\nto consider the situation. They determined to perfect their\r\norganization, to promulgate a secret propaganda, and to use the\r\ntribune in the Reichstag as the one open pulpit whence they could\r\nproclaim their wrongs.\r\n\r\nThe government promptly declared Berlin in a \"minor state of siege.\"\r\nIn the course of a few months about fifty agitators were expelled,\r\nbales of literature confiscated, organizations dissolved, meetings\r\ndismissed, gatherings prohibited, and the Socialist agitation pushed\r\ninto cellars and back rooms.\r\n\r\nBut there was one tribune which the Chancellor could not close--the\r\nReichstag tribune. Here Bebel and Liebknecht talked to the nation, and\r\ntheir speeches were given circulation through the records of debate.\r\nPrince Bismarck, in his extremity, tried to muzzle the Socialist\r\nmembers and expunge their words from the records; but the members of\r\nthe Reichstag refused this extreme measure. Then Bismarck asked\r\npermission to imprison Hasselman and expel Fritzche from Berlin. These\r\ntwo deputies had been especially vituperative in their attacks upon\r\nthe law. The Chancellor claimed that the famous Section 28 of the\r\nanti-Socialist law authorizing the minor state of siege extended to\r\nmembers of the Reichstag. But the House, under the vehement leadership\r\nof Professor Gneist, the distinguished constitutional lawyer, refused\r\nto sanction this dangerous measure on the ground that the thirty-first\r\narticle of the federal Constitution exempted members of the Reichstag\r\nfrom arrest.\r\n\r\nBismarck soon had another plan for ridding himself of the Socialist\r\nnettles in the Reichstag. He introduced a bill creating a\r\nparliamentary court chosen by the House, who should have the power to\r\npunish any member guilty of parliamentary indiscretion. The bill also\r\nempowered the House to prevent the publication of any of its\r\nproceedings if it desired. The Reichstag also refused to sanction this\r\nmeasure.\r\n\r\nThe assassination of Czar Alexander of Russia in March, 1881, gave\r\nBismarck the opportunity to renew his efforts to quell Socialism and\r\nAnarchism by international concert. He asked Russia to take the\r\ninitiative, and a conference was called at Brussels to which all the\r\nleading states were invited. Germany and Austria eagerly accepted,\r\nFrance made her participation dependent on England's action, and\r\nEngland refused to participate. Bismarck next tried to form an Eastern\r\nleague, but Austria failed him and he had to content himself with an\r\nextradition treaty with Russia.\r\n\r\nBismarck now fell back on his Socialist law. He enforced it with\r\nvigor, extending the minor state of siege to Altona, Leipsic, Hamburg,\r\nand Harburg. His commission reported yearly. Its words were not\r\nreassuring. In 1882 it said: \"The situation of the Social Democratic\r\nmovement in Germany and other civilized countries is unfortunately not\r\nsuch as to encourage the hope that it is being suppressed or\r\nweakened.\" The Minister of the Interior said to the Reichstag: \"It is\r\nbeyond doubt that it has not been possible by means of the law of\r\nOctober, 1878, to wipe Social Democracy from the face of the earth, or\r\neven to strike it to the center.\"[13]\r\n\r\nThe duration of the law had been fixed at two years. At the end of\r\neach term it was renewed, each time with diminishing majorities.\r\nMeanwhile the rigor of the law was not diminished. The minor state of\r\nsiege was extended to other centers, including Stettin and Offenbach.\r\nMeetings were suppressed everywhere, and dismissed often for the most\r\ntrivial reasons. The police were given the widest powers and exercised\r\nthem in the narrowest spirit.[14] \"A hateful system of persecution,\r\nespionage, and aggravation was established, and its victims were the\r\nclasses most susceptible to disaffection.\"[15]\r\n\r\nOn the unique _index expurgatorius_ of the government were over a\r\nthousand titles, including the works of the high priests of the party,\r\nthe poetry of Herwegh, the romances of Von Schweitzer, the photographs\r\nof the favorite Socialist saints, over eighty newspapers and sixty\r\nforeign journals. Bales of interdicted literature were smuggled in\r\nfrom Switzerland to feed the morose and disaffected mind of the German\r\nworkingman.\r\n\r\nI can find no record of how many arrests were made. Bebel reported to\r\nthe party convention in 1890 that 1,400 publications of all kinds had\r\nbeen interdicted and that 1,500 persons had been imprisoned, serving\r\nan aggregate of over one thousand years.[16] Every trial was a\r\nscattering of the seeds, and every imprisoned or exiled comrade\r\nbecame a hero. The awkwardness of the government was matched against\r\nthe adroitness of the propagandists. A good deal of terror was spread\r\namong the people, stories of sudden uprisings and bloody revolutions\r\nwere told. Even the National Liberals lost their heads at times. But\r\nBebel was always superbly cool. This woodturner developed into one of\r\nthe ablest political generals of his time.\r\n\r\nPersecuted and pressed into underground channels of activity the party\r\npersisted in growing. In 1880 it rid itself of the violent\r\nrevolutionary faction led by Most and Hasselman.\r\n\r\nIn the elections of 1881 the Socialists gained three deputies, but\r\ntheir popular vote was reduced over 125,000. In the next election,\r\n1884, they won twenty-four seats and polled 549,990 votes; two out of\r\nsix seats in Berlin were won, and one-tenth of the voters in the land\r\nwere rallied under the red flag. The police were alarmed and the law\r\nwas enforced with renewed energy.\r\n\r\nWith this powerful backing Liebknecht asked the repeal of the\r\n\"Explosives Act.\" A violent debate took place. Liebknecht said: \"I\r\nwill tell you this: we do not appeal to you for sympathy. The result\r\nis all the same to us, for we shall win one way or another. Do your\r\nworst, for it will be only to our advantage, and the more madly you\r\ncarry on the sooner you will come to an end. The pitcher goes to the\r\nwell until it breaks.\"[17]\r\n\r\nBebel roused all the fury of Bismarck when he warned him that if\r\nRussian methods were imported there would be murder. In July of this\r\nyear (1886) at Freiburg occurred the memorable trial of nine\r\nSocialist leaders, including Bebel, Dietz, Von Vollmar, Auer, Frohme,\r\nand Viereck, charged with participating in an illegal organization.\r\nAll were sentenced to imprisonment for terms varying from six to nine\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nPreceding the election of 1887 the Reichstag had been dissolved on the\r\narmy bill. The patriotic issue, always effective, was made the\r\nuniversal appeal by the government. In spite of this the Social\r\nDemocrats polled 763,128 votes, a gain of 213,128. Saxony had\r\nsucceeded in holding down the vote to 150,000; but in Prussia the\r\nresult was startling; in Berlin forty per cent. of the voters were\r\nSocial Democrats. With all their voting strength the party elected\r\nonly eleven members to the Reichstag. With proportional representation\r\nthey would have elected forty. The Bismarck Conservatives returned\r\nforty-one members with fewer votes than the Socialists.\r\n\r\nFinally in 1890 came the end of this farce. It was also the end of the\r\nchancellorship of Bismarck. His old Emperor had died, and a young and\r\ndaring hand was at the helm. Bismarck proposed to embody the\r\nanti-Socialist laws permanently in the penal code. This might have\r\npassed; but he also proposed to exile offenders, not merely from the\r\nterritory under minor siege, but from the Fatherland. This\r\nexpatriation the Assembly would not brook and the Reichstag was\r\nprorogued.\r\n\r\nThe Socialists left parliament with eleven members, they returned with\r\nthirty-five; they left with 760,000 mandates, they returned with\r\n1,500,000, more votes than any other party could claim, and on a\r\nproportional basis eighty-five seats would have been theirs. Bebel\r\nwas justified in saying in the Reichstag, \"The Chancellor thought he\r\nhad us, but we have him.\"\r\n\r\nWhen midnight sounded on the last day of the existence of the\r\noppressive law, great throngs of workingmen gathered in the streets of\r\nthe larger cities, to sing their Marseillaise, cheer their victory,\r\nand wave their red flag. Now they could breathe again.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in thirteen years they met in national convention\r\non German soil. The veteran Liebknecht, recounting their hardships and\r\nsacrifices, raised his voice in jubilant phrase: \"Our opponents did\r\nnot spare us, and we, too proud and too strong to prove cowardly,\r\nstruck blow for blow, and so we have conquered the odious law.\"[18]\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nDuring the enforcement of the anti-Socialist law Bismarck began the\r\nsecond part of his policy. He would repress with one hand, with the\r\nother he would placate. In 1883 he introduced his sickness insurance\r\nbill, followed in 1884-85 by his accident insurance, and in 1889 by\r\nhis old-age pension act.[19]\r\n\r\nIt is not unnatural that these measures were opposed by the Social\r\nDemocrats. They had no love for the Chancellor. The Dresden congress\r\ndecided to \"reject state Socialism unconditionally so long as it is\r\ninaugurated by Prince Bismarck and is designed to support the\r\ngovernment system.\" Bismarck \"had sown too much wind not to reap a\r\nwhirlwind.\"[20] He had planted hatred in the hearts of the workingmen;\r\nhe could not hope to reap respect and affection.\r\n\r\nBismarck believed that Socialism existed because the laboring man was\r\nnot sufficiently interested in the state. He had no property, and was\r\nnot enlightened enough to appreciate the intangible benefits of\r\nsovereignty. In 1880 German trade had reached a low ebb. Agriculture\r\nhad fallen into decay. German peasants and workingmen were emigrating\r\nto America by the tens of thousands. Bismarck promulgated his\r\nindustrial insurance, first, to placate the workingman; second, to\r\nrestore prosperity to German industry.\r\n\r\nAs a result of his policy Germany is to-day the most \"socialized\"\r\nstate in Europe. Here a workingman may begin life attended by a\r\nphysician paid by the state; he is christened by a state clergyman; he\r\nis taught the rudiments of learning and his handicraft by the state.\r\nHe begins work under the watchful eye of a state inspector, who sees\r\nthat the safeguards to health and limb are strictly observed. He is\r\ndrafted by the state into the army, and returns from the rigor of this\r\ndiscipline to his work. The state gives him license to marry,\r\nregisters his place of residence, follows him from place to place, and\r\nregisters the birth of his children. If he falls ill, his suffering is\r\nassuaged by the knowledge that his wife and children are cared for and\r\nthat his expenses will be paid during illness; and he may spend his\r\nconvalescent days in a luxurious state hospital. If he falls victim to\r\nan accident the dread of worklessness is removed by the ample\r\ninsurance commanded by the state even if his injury permanently\r\nincapacitates him. If he should unfortunately become that most pitiful\r\nof all men, the man out of work, the state and the city will do all in\r\ntheir power to find employment for him. If he wanders from town to\r\ntown in search of work the city has its shelter (Herberge) to welcome\r\nhim; if he wishes to move to another part of his town the municipal\r\nbureau will be glad to help him find a suitable house, or may even\r\nloan him money for building a house of his own. If he is in difficulty\r\nthe city places a lawyer at his disposal. If he is in a dispute with\r\nhis employer the government provides a court of arbitration. If he is\r\nsued or wishes to sue his employer, he does so in the workingmen's\r\ncourt (Gewerbe Gericht). If he wishes recreation, there is the city\r\ngarden; if he wishes entertainment let him go to the public concert;\r\nif he wishes to improve his mind there are libraries and free\r\nlectures. And if by rare chance, through the grace of the state's\r\nstrict sanitary regulations and by thrift and care, he reaches the age\r\nof seventy, he will find the closing days of his long life eased by a\r\npension, small, very small, to be sure, but yet enough to make him\r\nmore welcome to the relatives or friends who are charged with\r\nadministering to his wants.[21]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] For a comprehensive description of the German government, see\r\nDAWSON, _Germany and the Germans_, Vol. I.\r\n\r\n[2] Liebknecht said, in the Breslau congress of the Social-Democratic\r\nparty: \"Lassalle is the man in whom the modern organized German labor\r\nmovement had its origin.\"--\"Sozial-Demokratische Partei-Tag,\"\r\n_Protokoll_, 1895, p. 66.\r\n\r\n[3] For sketch of Lassalle and his work see KIRKUP, _History of\r\nSocialism_, pp. 72 et seq.; ELY, _French and German Socialism of Modern\r\nTimes_, p. 189; RAE, _Contemporary Socialism_, pp. 93 ff.

Banks, insurance,\r\nsavings banks, and pawnshops are conducted by the state.\r\nMunicipalities are landlords of vast estates, they are capitalists\r\nowning street cars, gas plants, electric light plants, theaters,\r\nmarkets, warehouses. They have hospitals for the sick, shelters for\r\nthe homeless, soup-houses for the hungry, asylums for the weak and\r\nunfortunate, nurseries for the babies, homes for the aged, and\r\ncemeteries for the dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nGERMAN SOCIAL DEMOCRACY AND LABOR UNIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nBefore we proceed to describe the present organization of the Social\r\nDemocratic Party it will be necessary to say a few words about the\r\norganization of labor in Germany.[1] There are four kinds of labor\r\nunions: the Social Democrat or free unions, the Hirsch-Duncker or\r\nradical unions, the Christian or Roman Catholic unions, and the\r\nIndependent unions. All except the last group have special political\r\nsignificance; and only the Independents confine themselves purely to\r\neconomic activity. The Socialist unions are called \"Reds,\" the\r\nIndependents \"Yellow,\" the Christians \"Black.\"\r\n\r\nThe Hirsch-Duncker unions were the first in the field. They were\r\norganized in 1868 by Dr. Hirsch and Herr Franz Duncker, for the\r\npurpose of winning the labor vote for the Progressists. Dr. Hirsch\r\nwent to England for his model, but the political bias he imparted to\r\nthe unions was very un-English. They have grown less political and\r\nmore neutral in every aspect, probably because political radicalism\r\nhas dwindled, and because they contain a great many of the most\r\nskilled of German workmen, the machinists. They are a sort of\r\naristocracy of labor, prefer peace to war, and hesitate long before\r\nstriking.\r\n\r\nThe Christian unions are strongest in the Rhine valley and the\r\nWestphalian mining districts. They are the offspring of Bishop\r\nKettler's workingmen's associations, organized to keep the laborer in\r\nharmony with the Roman Catholic Church. They have undergone a great\r\ndeal of change since the days of the distinguished bishop, and are now\r\nmodeled after strict trade-union principles. They retain their\r\nconnection with the Church and the Center Party (the Roman Catholic\r\ngroup in the Reichstag). For some years there has been a restlessness\r\namong these unions. The more militant members are protesting against\r\nthe influence of the clergy in union affairs, and demand that laborers\r\nlead labor.\r\n\r\nThe \"Yellow\" unions stand in bad repute among the others. They are for\r\npeace at any price. Their membership is largely composed of the\r\nengineering trades; and they are usually under contract not to strike,\r\nbut settle their differences by arbitration. The employing firms\r\ncontribute liberally to their union funds.\r\n\r\nBy far the largest unions are the Social Democratic or \"Free\" unions.\r\nThey embrace over eighty per cent. of all organized labor. Their\r\ngrowth has been very rapid during the last twenty years. In 1890, when\r\nthe Socialist law was lifted, they numbered a little over 250,000; in\r\n1910 they numbered nearly 2,000,000.\r\n\r\nAs organizations, the Social Democratic unions possess all the\r\nperfection of detail and painstaking craftsmanship for which the\r\nGermans are justly celebrated.[2] Not the minutest detail is omitted;\r\neverything is done to contribute to the solidarity of the working\r\nclasses. The theory of the German labor movement is, that physical\r\nenvironment is the first desideratum. A well-housed, well-groomed,\r\nwell-fed workman is a better fighter than a hungry, ragged man; and it\r\nis for fighting that the unions exist. The bed-rock of the German\r\nworkingman's theory is the maxim: \"First, be a good craftsman, and all\r\nother things will be added unto you.\"\r\n\r\nThese unions strive to do everything within their power to make,\r\nfirst, a good workman; second, a comfortable workman. This naturally,\r\nwithout artificial stimulants, brings the solidarity, the class\r\npatriotism, which is the source of the zeal and energy of these great\r\nfighting machines. In all of the larger towns they own clubhouses\r\n(Gewerkschaftshaeuser), which are the centers of incessant activity.\r\nThey contain assembly halls, restaurants, committee rooms, and\r\nlodgings for journeymen and apprentices (Wander-bursche) seeking work.\r\nThere are night classes, public lectures, educational excursions, and\r\ncirculating libraries. In Berlin the workingmen have organized a\r\ntheater.[3]\r\n\r\nThe workingman has a genuine sympathy for his union. It enlists his\r\nloyalty as much as his country enlists his patriotism. He finds social\r\nand intellectual intercourse, sympathy and responsiveness in his\r\nunion. He saves from his frugal wages to support the union and to\r\nswell the funds in its war-chest. He is never allowed to forget that\r\nhe is first a workingman, and owes his primary duties to his family\r\nand his union.[4]\r\n\r\nThis vast and perfect organization of labor has a complete\r\nunderstanding with the Social Democratic party, but it is not an\r\nintegral part of the party. When the unions began to revive, after the\r\nrepeal of the anti-Socialist law, there was a short and severe\r\nstruggle between the party and the unions for control. The victory of\r\nthe unions for complete autonomy was decisive. Since then good feeling\r\nand harmony have prevailed. The governing committees of the two bodies\r\nmeet for consultation, the powerful press of the party fights the\r\nunion's battles, and often party headquarters are in the union's\r\nclubhouse. They are virtually two independent branches of the same\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\nIn the national triennial convention of the Social Democratic unions\r\nat Hamburg, 1908, a speaker said: \"We can say with truth that to-day\r\nthere are no differences of a fundamental nature between the two great\r\nbranches [the Social Democratic unions and the Social Democratic\r\nParty] of the labor movement.\"[5]\r\n\r\nBebel has said of the relation between the unions and the party:\r\n\"Every workingman should belong to the union, and should be a party\r\nman; not merely as a laboring man, but as a class-conscious\r\n(Classenbewustsein) laboring man; as a member of a governmental and a\r\nsocial organization which treats and maltreats him as a laboring\r\nman.\"[6] This is the class spirit of Socialism, carried into practical\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, then, the vast bulk of organized labor is co-operating\r\nvoluntarily with the Social Democratic Party.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nAnd what is the present organization of the Social Democratic Party?\r\nIt is the most perfect party machine in the world. It is organized\r\nwith the most scrupulous regard for details and oiled with the\r\nexuberance of a class spirit that is emerging from its narrowness and\r\nis finding room for its expanding powers in the practical affairs of\r\nnational and municipal life. The only approach to it is the faultless,\r\nsilently moving, highly polished mechanism devised by the English\r\ngentry to control the political destinies of the British Empire. Our\r\nAmerican parties are crude compared with the noiseless efficacy of\r\nthe English machine, or the remorseless yet enthusiastic and entirely\r\neffective operation of the German Social Democracy.\r\n\r\nEvery detail of the workingman's life is embraced in this remarkable\r\npolitical organization. Every village and commune has its party\r\nvigilance committee. A juvenile department brings up the youth in the\r\nprinciples of the Social Democracy. The party press includes\r\nseventy-six daily papers, some of them brilliantly edited, a humorous\r\nweekly, and several monthly magazines. This press co-operates with the\r\ntrade journals. Some of these--notably the masons' journal and the\r\nironworkers' journal--have a vast circulation, numbering many hundred\r\nthousand subscribers.\r\n\r\nThe party propaganda is stupendous. In 1910 over 14,000 meetings were\r\nheld, and over 33,000,000 circulars and 2,800,000 brochures were\r\ndistributed. Every workingman, every voter, was personally solicited\r\nduring the campaign just closed (January, 1912). Committees and\r\nsub-committees were everywhere in this national beehive of workers.\r\nWomen and children were enlisted in the work.\r\n\r\nThe national party is controlled by an executive committee, elected by\r\nthe national convention, who govern its many activities with the\r\ngravity of a college faculty, the astuteness of a lawyer, and the\r\nfrugality of a tradesman. They issue annual reports, as full of\r\nstatistics and involved analyses as a government report. And they have\r\nno patience for party stars who are ambitious to move in the orbit of\r\ntheir own individual greatness.\r\n\r\nBecause the keynote of the party is solidarity, which is a synonym for\r\ndiscipline, \"We have no factions, we are one. Personally any Social\r\nDemocrat may believe as he pleases and do as he pleases. But when it\r\ncomes to political activity, we insist that he act with the party.\"\r\nThese are the words in which one of the younger leaders of the party\r\nexplained their unity to me.\r\n\r\nIn 1890, when the Bavarian rebels were under discussion in the\r\nnational congress, Bebel told the delegates that \"a fighting party\r\nsuch as our Social Democracy can only achieve its aims when every\r\nmember observes the strictest discipline.\"[7]\r\n\r\nEvidences of party discipline are not lacking. The Prussian\r\ntemperament is rough, dogmatic, implacable; the South German is\r\nmellow, yielding, kind. The two temperaments often clash. The one\r\nloves individual action; the other, military unity. The southern\r\nSocialist votes for his local budgets in town council and diet, and he\r\nreceives the chastisement of the northern disciplinarian with mellow\r\ngood-nature. But solidarity there is, whatever the price; and a\r\nclass-consciousness, a brotherhood: they call each other\r\n\"Comrades.\"[8]\r\n\r\nThe membership of the party includes all those who pay party dues and\r\nwill oblige themselves to party fealty, to do any drudgery demanded of\r\nthem.[9] In six parliamentary districts the membership equals thirty\r\nper cent. of the Social Democratic vote cast; in twenty-four other\r\ndistricts there is a membership of over 10,000 per district.[10] It is\r\ndifficult to say what proportion of the members of the union are\r\nmembers of the party. The vast bulk of the party members are laboring\r\nmen, and no doubt the majority of them are members of the union.\r\n\r\nIn the last imperial elections (January, 1912) this party cast\r\n4,250,000 votes, almost one-fourth of the entire federal electorate,\r\nand elected 110 members to the Reichstag, over one-fourth of the\r\nentire membership.[11] In nineteen state legislatures the Social\r\nDemocrats have 186 members, in 396 city councils 1,813 members, and in\r\n2,009 communal councils 5,720 members.[12]\r\n\r\nThe supreme authority of the party is the annual national convention,\r\ncalled \"congress.\" Here detailed reports are made by the various\r\ncommittees; and the parliamentary delegation make an elaborate\r\nstatement, detailing every official act of the group in the Reichstag.\r\nEverything is discussed by everybody; the speeches made by the members\r\nin the Reichstag, the opinions of the party editors in their daily\r\neditorials, the party finances, everything is freely criticised. The\r\nmost insignificant member has the same privilege of criticism as the\r\nparty czars; and the criticism often becomes naively personal. No\r\ndoubt the party patriotism is largely fed by this frank, fearless,\r\naboveboard airing of grievances, this freedom from \"boss rule.\" Every\r\none has his opportunity, and this robs the plotter and backbiter of\r\nhis venom.\r\n\r\nHaving listened to the faultfinder, they vote; and having voted, they\r\nrarely relent. When a decision is reached, the members are expected to\r\nabide by it faithfully and cheerfully. They make short work of\r\ntraitors.[13]\r\n\r\nEvery year a detailed report on the imperial budget is read, showing\r\nhow the money is spent on armaments, on police, on courts, and every\r\nother department of the empire; and how the money is raised. The\r\nconvention resolves itself into a school of public finance. This\r\nanalysis is sent broadcast, as a campaign document. So yearly a report\r\nis read of the number of arrests made and the fines and penalties\r\nensuing, on account of _lese-majeste_ and other laws infringing upon\r\nthe liberty of the press and of speech. Also, every year the central\r\ncommittee report, in great detail, every party activity in every\r\ncorner of the empire. A well-knit hegemony of party interest is\r\ncreated. The mass is willing to listen to the individual, to bend to\r\nthe needs of the smallest commune.\r\n\r\nThroughout their frank discussions and involved debates there runs a\r\ncertain polysyllabic flavor that is characteristically German. They\r\noften choose, a year in advance, some important national question,\r\nsuch as the tariff, mining laws, the agrarian situation, and discuss\r\nit in great detail, more like an academy of universal knowledge than a\r\npolitical party. The learned blend their involved phraseology and\r\nstore of facts with the refreshing frankness and ignorance of the\r\nunlearned.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nWe will now return to the present activities of this party that was\r\nborn in revolution and nurtured by persecution. In order to\r\nunderstand this activity, it is necessary to review the present\r\nattitude of the government toward democracy and Socialism. The repeal\r\nof the anti-Socialist law could not suddenly alter the spirit of\r\nopposition. It merely changed the outward aspect of the opposition.\r\n\r\nThe government indicates in many ways its distrust of Social\r\nDemocrats. No member of the party has ever been invited by the\r\ngovernment to a place of public honor and responsibility. Indeed, to\r\nbe a Social Democrat effectively closes the door against promotion in\r\ncivil life.[14] This silent hostility is not confined to political\r\noffices and the civil service; it extends into the professions. Judges\r\nand public physicians, pastors in the state church, teachers in the\r\npublic schools, professors in the great universities are included in\r\nthe ban. A pastor may be a \"Christian Socialist,\" a professor may\r\nnourish his \"Socialism of the chair,\" and a judge or a government\r\nengineer may be inclined toward far-reaching social experiment. But\r\nwith Social Democracy they must have absolutely nothing to do.[15]\r\n\r\nThe government's attitude is based on the theory that the Social\r\nDemocrats are enemies of the monarchy, and are designing to overthrow\r\nit and declare a republic the moment they get into power. The Kaiser,\r\non several public occasions, has expressed his distrust and\r\ndisapproval for this vast multitude of his subjects. A number of\r\nyears ago he is reported to have said that \"the Social Democrats are a\r\nband of persons who are unworthy of their fatherland\" (\"Eine Bande von\r\nMenschen die ihres Vaterlands nicht wuerdig sind\"). And more recently:\r\n\"The Social Democrats are a crowd of upstarts without a fatherland\"\r\n(\"Vaterlandslose Gesellen\"). The Kaiser joined in the public rejoicing\r\nover the check that had apparently been administered to the growth of\r\nthe Social Democracy by the elections of 1907, and in a speech\r\ndelivered to a throng of citizens gathered for jubilation in the\r\npalace yard in Berlin, he said that the \"Socialists have been ridden\r\ndown\" (\"niedergeritten\"), a military figure of speech.\r\n\r\nRetaliation is not unnatural. The pictures of the Hohenzollerns and\r\nthe high functionaries of state and army do not adorn the walls of the\r\nhomes of the Social Democrats. There are seen the portraits of Marx\r\nand Lassalle, Liebknecht and Bebel. The members of the party never\r\njoin in a public display of confidence in the government. They\r\nexercise a petty tyranny over their neighbors. Instances are told of\r\nshopkeepers who were compelled to yield to the boycott instituted\r\nagainst them because they voted against the Social Democrats, and of\r\nworkmen coerced into joining the union.\r\n\r\nThis feeling of bitterness is most clearly marked in Prussia. In\r\nsouthern Germany a feeling of good will and co-operation is becoming\r\nmore marked every year. The King of Bavaria is not afraid to shake\r\nhands with Von Vollmar. Some years ago a Bavarian railway employee was\r\nelected to the Diet on the Social Democratic ticket, and his employer,\r\nthe state, gave him leave of absence to attend to his legislative\r\nduties. In Baden the leader of the Social Democratic Party called at\r\nthe palace to present the felicitations of his comrades to the royal\r\nfamily on the occasion of the birth of an heir.\r\n\r\nThe principal immediate issue of the Social Democrats in Germany is\r\nelectoral reform. None of the states or provinces are on a genuinely\r\ndemocratic electoral basis. In Saxony a new electoral law was passed\r\nin 1909 which typifies the spirit of the entire country.[16] The\r\nelectorate is divided into four classes according to their income. The\r\nresult of the first election under this law in the city of Leipsic was\r\nas follows: There were 172,800 votes cast by 79,928 voters.\r\n\r\n  32,576 voters in the   one-vote class cast 32,576 votes\r\n  20,323   \"    \"   \"    two-  \"    \"    \"   40,646   \"\r\n   8,538   \"    \"   \"  three-  \"    \"    \"   25,614   \"\r\n  18,491   \"    \"   \"   four-  \"    \"    \"   73,964   \"\r\n\r\nThere are ninety-one members in the Saxon Diet. The law provided that\r\nonly forty-three of these should be elected from the cities. The three\r\nleading cities of Saxony, Chemnitz, Dresden, Leipsic, are strongholds\r\nof Social Democracy, while the country districts are Conservative. The\r\nSocial Democrats feel that the property qualifications and the\r\ndistribution of the districts impose an unfair handicap against them.\r\nIn spite of these obstacles they elected so many deputies that they\r\nwere offered the vice-presidency of the Chamber of Deputies. The\r\noffer, however, was conditioned upon their attending the annual\r\nreception given by the King to the representatives. They had hitherto\r\nrefused to attend these royal functions and were not willing to\r\nsurrender for the sake of office.[17]\r\n\r\nThe ancient free cities--Hamburg, Bremen, Luebeck--have election laws\r\nas ancient and antiquated as their charters. In Luebeck a large\r\nmajority of the legislative body is elected by electors having an\r\nincome of over 2,000 marks a year. In Hamburg the nobles, higher\r\nofficials, etc., elect 40 representatives, the householders elect 40,\r\nthe large landholders elect 8, those citizens having an income of over\r\n2,500 marks a year elect 48, those who have an income from 1,200 to\r\n2,500 marks a year elect 24, those who have an income of less than\r\n1,200 marks have no vote. In Bremen the various groups or kinds of\r\nproperty are represented in the law-making body. Property, not the\r\nperson, is represented.\r\n\r\nPrussia is the special grievance of the Social Democrats. Here the\r\nthree-class system of voting prevails. The taxpayers are divided into\r\nthree classes, according to the amount of taxes paid, each class\r\npaying one-third of the taxes. Each class chooses one-third of the\r\nelectors who name the members of the Prussian Diet. By this\r\narrangement the large property class virtually controls the\r\nelections.[18] By this system the Social Democratic representation is\r\nheld down to 6 in a membership of 420. In 1909 the party polled\r\n23-9/10 per cent. of the entire Prussian vote. Here again the\r\ndistricts are so arranged that the majority of the members are elected\r\nfrom the Conservative rural districts, while the cities, which are\r\nstrongholds of Social Democracy, must content themselves with a\r\nminority, although nearly 60 per cent. of the population of Prussia is\r\nurban. These examples are sufficient to indicate the general nature of\r\nfranchise legislation in Germany.[19] For the past several years\r\nuniversal suffrage demonstrations have been held throughout the\r\nempire. The general strike has not been used as a method of political\r\ncoercion. It is doubtful whether the German temperament is adapted to\r\nthat kind of warfare. Mass-meetings, however, and street\r\ndemonstrations are the favorite means of the propaganda. Sometimes\r\nthere are conflicts with the police, but these are diminishing in\r\nnumber every year. The government has not diminished its vigilance,\r\nand its jealous eyes are never averted from these demonstrations.[20]\r\n\r\nAn incident occurred in March, 1910, which illustrates the temper of\r\nthe people and the government. A gigantic demonstration was announced,\r\nto be held in Treptow Park, Berlin. The Police-president forbade the\r\nmeeting and had every street leading to the park carefully guarded.\r\nOne hundred and fifty thousand demonstrants met in the Thiergarten, in\r\nthe very heart of the city, and so secretly had the word been given,\r\nso quietly was it executed, and so orderly was this vast throng of\r\nworkingman, that the police knew nothing of it until the meeting was\r\nwell under way. Permission for the Treptow meeting was not again\r\nrefused.\r\n\r\nThe immediate issue, then, of the German Social Democracy is universal\r\nsuffrage. Lassalle's cry is more piercing to-day than when that\r\nbrilliant and erratic agitator uttered it: \"Democracy, the universal\r\nballot, is the laboring man's hope.\" The name of the party is\r\nsignificant. The accent has shifted from the first to the second part\r\nof the compound--from the Marxian to the Lassallian word.\r\n\r\nThe German Social Democrats have never had a Millerand or a Briand or\r\na John Burns; their participation in imperial and provincial affairs\r\nhas been strictly limited to parliamentary criticism. Even in local\r\ngovernment, in the communes and cities, they have been allowed only a\r\nsmall share in actual constructive work. But in spite of these facts\r\nthe party has undergone a most remarkable change of creed and tone.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nWe will concern ourselves only with the most significant changes.\r\nThese follow two general lines: (1) the attitude of the party towards\r\nlegislation and practical parliamentary participation; (2) the\r\ninternal changes in the party. We will follow these changes through\r\nthe official reports of the annual party conventions.\r\n\r\nFirst we will briefly see what change has taken place in their\r\nattitude toward parliamentary activity. The Social Democrats began as\r\nrevolutionists and violent anti-parliamentarians. They entered\r\nparliament, not to make laws, but to make trouble. In 1890 they\r\nchanged their name from the Socialist Labor Party to the Social\r\nDemocratic Party; and when some of the older members thought that this\r\nwas a compromise with their enemies, one of the leaders replied that\r\n\"a Socialist party must _eo ipse_ be a democratic party.\"[21] In 1890\r\nLiebknecht said: \"Formerly we had an entirely different tactic.\r\nTactics and principles are two different things. In 1869 in a speech\r\nin Berlin I condemned parliamentary activity. That was then. Political\r\nconditions were entirely different.\"[22] Gradually tactics and\r\nprinciples have coalesced until their line of cleavage is obscured.\r\n\r\nThe earlier reports of the parliamentary delegation are tinged with\r\napology--they are in parliament as protestors, as propagandists, not\r\nas legislators. They seem to say: \"Fellow-partisans, excuse us for\r\nbeing in the Reichstag. We don't believe in the bourgeois law-making\r\ndevices. But since we are here, we purpose to do what we can for the\r\ncause. We will not betray you, nor the glorious Socialistic state of\r\nsociety that we are all working for.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the first, Social Democrats have voted against the imperial\r\nbudget, have opposed all tariffs, indirect taxes, extension of the\r\npolice power, increase in naval and military expenditure, and colonial\r\nexploitation. They took no part at first in law-making, held\r\nthemselves disdainfully aloof from practical parliamentary efforts,\r\nand especially avoided every appearance of coalition with other\r\nparties.\r\n\r\nBut gradually a change came over them. In 1895 they nominated one of\r\ntheir number for secretary of the Reichstag.[23]\r\n\r\nGingerly they dipped their fingers into the pottage of reality. Soon\r\nthey began to introduce bills. In 1901 they proposed a measure that\r\nincreased the allowance of the private soldier. Their bill became a\r\nlaw. In the next national convention, when they were called to task\r\nfor their worldliness, they excused themselves by saying that ninety\r\nper cent. of the private soldiers were proletarians and their parents\r\nwere too poor to supply them with the money necessary for army\r\nsundries, and the allowance of the state had been inadequate. This was\r\ntherefore a law that actually benefited the poor.\r\n\r\nIn 1906 and 1908 they were compelled to face the practical question of\r\nan inheritance tax. The delegation supported the measure, after\r\nprolonged deliberation over what action to take. This action\r\nprecipitated a heated discussion in the party congress; the veterans\r\nfeared the party was surrendering its principles. They were assured by\r\nBebel that the vote was orthodox.[24]\r\n\r\nIn 1906 the party instructed its delegation to introduce bills for\r\nredistricting the empire for Reichstag elections; to reduce the\r\nlegislative period from five to three years; to revise the laws\r\nrelating to sailors and provide for better inspection of ships and\r\nshipping. These instructions mark a revolution in German Social\r\nDemocracy, a change that can best be illustrated by the shift in its\r\nattitude on state insurance. In 1892 the party resolved: \"So-called\r\nstate Socialism, in so far as it concerns itself with bettering the\r\nconditions of the working people, is a system of half-reforms whose\r\norigin is in the fear of Social Democracy. It aims, through all kinds\r\nof palliatives and little concessions, to estrange the working people\r\nfrom Social Democracy and to cripple the party.\r\n\r\n\"The Social Democracy have never disdained to ask for such\r\ngovernmental regulations, or, if proposed by the opposition, to\r\napprove of those measures which could better the conditions of labor\r\nunder the present industrial system. But Social Democrats view such\r\nregulations as only little payments on account, which in nowise\r\nconfuse the Social Democracy in its striving for a new organization of\r\nsociety.\"[25]\r\n\r\nThey are now not above collecting even small sums on account. In 1910\r\ntheir convention declares that state insurance is \"the object of\r\nconstant agitation. For what we have thus far secured by no means\r\napproaches what the laborer demands.\"[26]\r\n\r\nThe committee on parliamentary action reported, a few years ago, that\r\n\"no opportunity was lost for entering the lists in behalf of political\r\nand cultural progress. In the discussion of all bills and other\r\nbusiness matters, the members of the delegation took an active part in\r\ncommittee as well as in _plenum_.\"[27] There is no longer half-abashed\r\njuvenile reluctance at legislative participation. The reports boast of\r\nthe work done by the party in behalf of the workingman, the peasant,\r\nsmall tradesman, small farmer, and humbler government employees.\r\nEleven bills were introduced by the delegation in 1909-10, relating to\r\nfactory and mine inspection, amending the state insurance laws, the\r\ntariff laws, the redistricting of the empire for Reichstag\r\nelections--i.e., all pertaining to labor, politics, and finance.\r\nTwenty resolutions were moved by the delegation, and many\r\ninterpellations called.\r\n\r\nInterpellation, however, is not very satisfactory in a government\r\nwhere the ministry is not responsible to parliament. In 1909 the\r\nSocial Democrats introduced a bill to make the Chancellor and his\r\ncabinet responsible to the Reichstag. Ledebour, who made the leading\r\nspeech for the Social Democrats, gave a clear exposition of his\r\nparty's contention. He wanted a government \"wherein the people, in the\r\nfinal analysis, decided the fate of the government. For, in such a\r\ngovernment, only those men come into power who represent a program,\r\nrepresent conviction and character; not any one who has succeeded, for\r\nthe moment, in pleasing the fancy and becoming the favorite of the\r\ndetermining kamarilla.\" If the election should turn on this issue,\r\n\"whether there shall be a perpetuation of the sham-constitutional,\r\njunker bureaucracy, or the establishing of a democratic parliamentary\r\nauthority,\" the parliamentary party would win. \"The will of the people\r\nshould be the highest law.\"[28]\r\n\r\nIn January, 1912, this party of isolation entered the Reichstag as the\r\nstrongest group: 110 members acknowledge the leadership of Bebel. By\r\nco-operating with the Radicals and National Liberals, the progressive\r\nelements had a majority over the Conservative and Clerical\r\nreactionaries for the first time in the history of the empire. Here\r\nBebel consented to become a candidate for president of the Chamber. He\r\nreceived 175 votes; the candidate of the Conservatives, Dr. Spahn,\r\nleader of the Clerical Center, received 196. Enough National Liberals\r\nhad wavered to throw the balance in favor of Conservatism. A Socialist\r\nwas elected first vice-president, and a National Liberal second\r\nvice-president. The President-elect refused to act with a Socialist\r\nvice-president and resigned. The Radical member from Berlin, Herr\r\nKaempf, was then elected President.[29] Thereupon the National Liberal\r\nsecond vice-president also resigned, and a Radical was chosen in his\r\nstead. The Social Democrats and the Radicals were made responsible for\r\nthe leadership of the new Reichstag.\r\n\r\nIt is customary for the President and the vice-president of the\r\nChamber to announce to the Kaiser when the Reichstag is organized and\r\nready for business. The Kaiser let it be known that he did not care to\r\nreceive the Radical officers. The Socialist first vice-president\r\nrefused to join in the proposed official visit. The Prussian temper is\r\nslow to change.\r\n\r\nThese illustrations clearly indicate the trend of Social Democratic\r\nlegislative and political policy. It is the universal story--ambition\r\nbrings power, power brings responsibility, responsibility sobers the\r\nsenses.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nThe second development that we are to trace relates to the program, or\r\nplatform, of the party. The official program has not undergone any\r\nchange, but the interpretation, the spirit, has mellowed. The Erfurter\r\nprogram of 1891 is still their party pledge. The program is in two\r\nparts; the first an elaborate exposition of Marxian economics, the\r\nsecond a series of practical demands differing only slightly from the\r\nGotha program.\r\n\r\nOnly one speech was made in the national convention on the adoption of\r\nthis bifurcated platform, that attempted to link Marxian theory to\r\nLassallian realism. This speech was made by Liebknecht, friend of\r\nMarx, who elaborately explained his friend's theory of value, doctrine\r\nof class war and social evolution. The program was adopted _en bloc_.\r\nThe chairman ignored a few protesting \"noes\" when the vote was called,\r\nand declared it unanimously adopted. These few voices of protest soon\r\nswelled to considerable volume. Within one year after the repeal of\r\nthe Socialist law the party had entered upon the difficult task of\r\nbeing both critic and parliamentarian, constructive and destructive,\r\nunder rigid military discipline.\r\n\r\nTo the few protesters at Erfurt, it seemed as though the party had\r\nentered the lifeboat, manned the oars, and neglected to untie the\r\npainter.\r\n\r\nWhen the elections of 1897 recorded a severe setback for the party the\r\nprogressives were told to keep the eyes of faith on the \"ultimate\r\ngoal\" of Socialism. One of the reformistes replied: \"The whole idea of\r\nan ultimate goal is distasteful to me. There is no ultimate goal; for\r\nbeyond your ultimate goal is another world of striving.\"[30] And\r\nanother critic said: \"Nothing wears threadbare so rapidly by constant\r\nuse as words of faith. Constantly spoken or heard, they become\r\nstereotyped into phrases, and the inspired prophet creates the same\r\noffensive impression as a priest who has nothing else to offer but\r\nwords.\" The interest of the workingman \"finds its expression in the\r\npracticalness of the second part of the Erfurter program, and the\r\nwholly practical work of the party.\"[31] It was at this time that\r\nEdward Bernstein, friend and literary heir of Engel, published a\r\nseries of critical papers in the party journal, _Die Neue Zeit_,\r\nattacking especially the catastrophic and revolutionary postulates and\r\nsaying \"the movement is everything, the goal is nothing.\" Kautsky, the\r\ndogmatist of the party, replied to these articles and a feverish\r\ndiscussion followed in all the party press.[32]\r\n\r\nIn the party conventions of 1898 and 1899 this controversy was waged\r\nwith considerable energy. Von Vollmar made merry over Kautsky's\r\n\"inquisition\" and called the debate \"a noisy cackling over nothing.\"\r\nThe mass of the party, he said, did not trouble their heads about\r\ntheories, but plodded along unmindful of hairsplitting.[33] Bebel made\r\na herculean effort to reconcile both elements. To the revisionists he\r\nsaid, \"We are in a constant state of intellectual moulting,\"[34] to\r\nthe orthodox he said, \"We remain what we have always been.\"[35]\r\n\r\nIt was at Dresden, 1903, that the revisionist tempest reached its\r\nheight in the party teapot. The Germans' love for polysyllabic\r\nphrase-making, for which Jaures taunted them at the Amsterdam\r\ncongress, was here given full play. Von Vollmar repeated that nobody\r\nexcept a few dull theorists read Kautsky's or Bernstein's views; the\r\nmass of voters cared for practical results, and \"revisionists and\r\nanti-revisionists are nothing but a bugbear.\"[36]\r\n\r\nHere the matter rested until the elections of 1907 opened the eyes of\r\nthe party high priests. They gained only 248,249 votes and lost\r\none-half of their seats in the Reichstag. A number of the leading\r\nSocialists promptly began to attack the dogmas of the party program as\r\nillusions and pitfalls. The class war, the revolutionary method, the\r\ntheory of an ever-increasing proletariat and decreasing bourgeoisie\r\nwere attacked as unscientific, and illusory. \"The Erfurt program\r\nrecites a vagary, it repels the intellect, it must be changed;\" that\r\nwas the opinion of the advanced thinkers of the party.\r\n\r\nNo party congresses, no priestly pronunciamentos have been able to\r\ncheck the spread of revolt. As long as Kautsky and Bebel live the\r\nprogram will probably not be re-phrased. But even Kautsky is mellowing\r\nunder the ripeness of years and circumstances; and Bebel, shrewd\r\npolitician, knows the campaigning value of appearing at the same time\r\northodox and progressive.[37]\r\n\r\nTo-day one hears very little of Marx and a great deal of legislation.\r\nThe last election, with its brilliant victory for Social Democracy,\r\nwas not won on the general issues of the Erfurter program but on the\r\nparticular issue of the arrogance of the bureaucracy, and ballot\r\nreform. A large mass of voters cast their ballots for Social\r\nDemocratic candidates as a protest against existing governmental\r\nconditions, not as an affirmation of their assent to the Marxian\r\ndogmas. The truth is, Marx is a tradition, democracy is an issue.[38]\r\n\r\nAnother indication of the notable changes that have come over Social\r\nDemocracy is seen in the Socialists' relation to other parties. Here\r\ntheir dogmatic aloofness is the most tenacious. During the years of\r\ntheir bitter persecution by the government they found their excuse in\r\nan isolation that was forced upon them. Von Vollmar told his\r\ncolleagues, immediately after the repeal of the anti-Socialist law,\r\nthat the South Germans were ready to co-operate with every one who\r\nwould be willing to give them an inch. In reply to this Bebel\r\nintroduced a resolution affirming that \"the primary necessity of\r\nattaining political power\" could not be \"the work of a moment,\" but\r\nwas attained only by gradual growth. During the period of growth the\r\nSocial Democrats should not work for mere \"concessions from the ruling\r\nclasses,\" but \"have only the ultimate and complete aim of the party in\r\nmind.\" The Bebelian theory linked the ultimate goal with ultimate\r\npower, both to be attained by waiting until the flood tide.\r\n\r\nThis question became practical when the Social Democratic members of\r\nthe provincial legislatures voted with other parties for the state\r\nbudget. The national party claimed authority over the local party, a\r\nclaim which was resented by the Bavarians and other South German\r\ndelegations.[39]\r\n\r\nIn 1894 the South Germans were chastised by a vote of 164 to 64 for\r\nvoting for their state budget. They were rebuked again in 1901 and in\r\n1908. In the latter year Bebel told them \"three times is enough,\"\r\nindicating that there would be a split in the party if they insisted\r\non voting for their local budgets. The South Germans defended their\r\naction by saying that they had always agitated for more pay for state\r\nemployees, and that they were willing to vote the funds that would\r\nmake this possible. A new champion appeared for the reformistes--Dr.\r\nFrank of Mannheim, a brilliant speaker who is called by his following\r\na \"second Lassalle.\" He made a withering attack on the Marxian school,\r\nbut Bebel's censure was carried by 256 to 119.\r\n\r\nFinally at Magdeburg, 1910, the budget question reached its climax.\r\nBebel boasted that his policy of negation had wrought great changes in\r\nGermany. \"I say it without boasting, in the whole world there is no\r\nSocial Democracy that has accomplished as much positive good as the\r\nGerman Social Democracy.\"[40] He claimed the insurance laws, factory\r\nlaws, and the repeal of special and oppressive legislation as the\r\nfruits of his policy. Bebel then warned the Badensians that this is\r\nthe last time they will be forgiven; one other offense, and they will\r\nbe put out of the party.\r\n\r\nDr. Frank made an elaborate reply. He said that there was a working\r\nagreement between the Social Democrats and Liberals whereby they\r\nco-operated against the Conservatives. In the state legislature they\r\nhad a \"bloc\" with the Liberals and had elected a vice-president and\r\nsecretary and important chairmanships by means of this coalition. They\r\nhad, moreover, reformed the public school system, secured factory\r\nlegislation, and had secured direct elections in all towns of 4,000\r\nor over. The reformistes' principles are so clearly stated in this\r\nspeech that I quote several paragraphs:\r\n\r\n\"I tell you, comrades, if you think that under all the circumstances\r\nyou can win only small concessions; with such a message of\r\nhopelessness you will not conquer the world, not even the smallest\r\nelection district. [_Great commotion and disturbance._] But what would\r\nbe the meaning of this admission that small concessions can be\r\nsecured? In tearing down a building dramatic effects are possible. But\r\nthe erection of a building is accomplished only by an accumulation of\r\nsmall concessions. Behold the labor unions, that are so often spoken\r\nof, how they struggle for months, how they suffer hunger for months,\r\nin order to win a concession of a few pennies. Often one can see that\r\na small concession contains enormous future possibilities, and in\r\ntwenty or thirty years will become a vital force in the shaping of the\r\nsociety that is to come.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor will I examine the question whether in parliamentary activity\r\nonly small concessions can be won. Is it not possible, through\r\nparliamentary action, to take high tariffs and business speculations\r\nfrom the necks of the workingmen? Is it not possible to modify police\r\nadministration, and the legislative conditions that profane Prussia\r\nto-day? Are these conditions necessary concomitants of the modern\r\nclass-state (Klassenstaat)? Is it not possible to create out of\r\nPrussia and Germany a modern state, where our workingmen, even as\r\ntheir brethren in Western Europe, can fight their great battles upon\r\nthe field of democratic equality and citizenship? If you wish to view\r\nall that as 'small concessions' you are at liberty to do so. I view it\r\nas a tremendous revolution, if it succeeds, to secure, through such a\r\nstruggle, liberty for the Prussian working class.\"[41]\r\n\r\nThe censure was carried, the Baden delegation left the hall during the\r\nvoting. On the following day it returned to declare its loyalty to the\r\nparty, but with the proviso that they would by no means promise how\r\nthey would vote on their state budget in the future.\r\n\r\nEvents are shaping themselves rapidly in Germany. Ministerial\r\nresponsibility cannot much longer be denied. The elections of 1912\r\nshould serve as a plain portent to the reactionaries. That Bebel is\r\nwilling to be a candidate for President of the Reichstag is a\r\nsignificant concession; that the Radicals and many National Liberals\r\nare willing to vote for him, would have been deemed impossible ten\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\nSuch conditions as prevail between the government and the Radicals and\r\nSocial Democrats cannot long continue. The break with the past must\r\ncome, sooner or later. The pressure of Radical and Democratic votes\r\nwill become so powerful, that not even the strong traditions of the\r\nempire can wholly withstand it.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1911, I visited the Reichstag on an eventful occasion. The\r\nSocial Democrats had voted with the government for a new Constitution\r\nfor Alsace-Lorraine containing universal manhood suffrage. Herr Bebel\r\nwas jubilant. He said: \"It marks a new epoch. We have voted with the\r\ngovernment. Not that we have capitulated. But the government have come\r\nto our convictions, they have granted universal suffrage to Alsace,\r\nnow they cannot long deny that right to Prussia and the other\r\nstates.\"[42]\r\n\r\nWe have now seen that politically a great change has come over the\r\nGerman Socialists; that they are participating in legislation, and are\r\nespecially solicitous about all acts that pertain to labor and\r\npolitical liberty; that they are gradually moving toward co-operation\r\nwith other parties; that they are gradually sloughing off the\r\ninflexible Marxian armor, and are assuming the pliable dress of\r\nmodernism.\r\n\r\nAll this is to be expected of a party that began as a vigorous,\r\nnarrow, autocratic party of revolution and protest, and is emerging\r\nfrom its hard experiences, a self-styled \"cultural party\" (\"Kultur\r\nPartei\"). Dr. Suedekum, editor of Communal Praxis, in his report of the\r\nparliamentary group, in 1907, wrote: \"We have in the Reichstag two\r\nkinds of duties; first, the propaganda of our ideas and program;\r\nsecond, practical work, i.e., to enhance, not alone the interests of\r\nthe working class, but the entire complex, so-called cultural\r\ninterests. The problems that the Social Democratic party as a\r\n'cultural party' has to solve, which are assigned to it as the\r\nrepresentative of cultural progress in every realm of human activity,\r\nmust increase in the same proportion that the bourgeois parties allow\r\nthemselves to be captured by the government and neglect these\r\nproblems.\"[43]\r\n\r\nIt is a far cry from \"class war\" to \"human cultural activities.\" Such\r\nan expansion of purpose requires a greatly enlarged electorate. The\r\nmajority of the workingmen are already in the party, where will the\r\nincrease come from?\r\n\r\nThere are two directions in which the party can hope to gain new\r\nrecruits--the small farmer and the small tradesman. The small farmer\r\nis peculiarly hard to reach. He is well guarded--the Church on the one\r\nside, the landlord and _junker_ on the other. To step in and steal his\r\nheart is a very difficult task. The work is pushed steadily, with\r\ntenacity, but results are slow in coming.\r\n\r\nAmong the tradespeople and business men, there is more rapid progress,\r\nespecially in southern Germany. In Munich a great many tradespeople\r\nvote for Von Vollmar.[44]\r\n\r\nPrimarily it will always be a workingman's party. Its soul is the\r\nlabor movement. Its political aim is democracy, and its hope is the\r\npower of sheer preponderance of numbers. What it will do when it has\r\nthat power is a speculation that does not lure the prosaic Teutonic\r\nmind. \"We will find plenty to do,\" one of them said, \"when we have the\r\ngovernment. We have plenty to do now, that we haven't the government.\"\r\nThis is wisdom learned of France.\r\n\r\nThis means that the party have given up their \"splendid\r\nisolation\"--what Von Vollmar called their \"policy of sterility and\r\ndespair\"[45]--a policy which they acknowledged by words long after\r\nthey had abandoned it in fact. They abandoned it the moment they\r\nchampioned labor legislation, and sought the sanitation of cities and\r\nthe opening of parks, in their municipal councils.\r\n\r\nThe pressure of things as they are has been too powerful for even the\r\nGerman Social Democracy, with its dogmatic temper and strength of\r\nmillions. Revolution has, even here, been replaced by a slow and\r\norderly development.\r\n\r\nThe rapidity with which the medieval empire will be democratized will\r\ndepend upon the formation of a genuine liberal party that will enlist\r\nthose citizens who are inclined toward modernism but cannot be enticed\r\ninto the Social Democratic or Radical parties. When such a party is\r\nformed, and an alliance made with the Social Democrats, then the\r\ntransformations will be rapid.[46] Among the most significant\r\naccessions to the Social Democracy are many professional men: lawyers,\r\nphysicians, engineers, etc. This augurs a change in party spirit and\r\nmethod. Dr. Frank of Mannheim told me that he considered the extent to\r\nwhich the party could lure the intellectual element the measure of the\r\nparty greatness and power.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nA word should be added upon the attitude of the Social Democrats\r\ntoward militarism. The standing army and the increasing navy of\r\nGermany are a heavy tax upon the people. The Germans for centuries\r\nhave been military in ambition, soldiers by instinct.\r\n\r\nThe Social Democrats, in common with all Socialists, are opposed to\r\nwar. But the German is a patriot. In the International Congress at\r\nStuttgart, the French and Russian delegations imposed an extreme\r\nanti-military resolution upon the Socialists, against the protest of\r\nthe Germans. Bebel called their anti-patriotic utterances \"silly\r\nword-juggling.\"[47]\r\n\r\nThe Berlin congress, 1892, adopted the following resolution, in view\r\nof the added military burdens proposed by the Reichstag: \"The\r\nprevailing military system, not being able to guarantee the country\r\nagainst foreign invasion, is a continual threat to international peace\r\nand serves the capitalistic class-government, whose aim is the\r\nindustrial exploitation and suppression of the working classes, as an\r\ninstrument of oppression against the masses.\r\n\r\n\"The party convention therefore demands, in consonance with the\r\nprogram of the Social Democratic platform, the establishment of a\r\nsystem of defense based upon a general militia, trained and armed. The\r\ncongress declares that the Social Democratic members of the Reichstag\r\nare in complete accord with the party and with the politically\r\norganized working classes of Germany, when they vote against every\r\nmeasure of the government aimed at perpetuating the present military\r\nsystem.\"[48]\r\n\r\nDuring a debate in the Reichstag in 1907, Bebel declared, in the\r\ndefense of the Fatherland, _if it were invaded_, even he in his old\r\nage would \"shoulder a musket.\" He demanded military drill for youths\r\nas a preliminary to the shortening of military service in the standing\r\narmy; if this were not done the defense of the country would be\r\nweakened whenever the service shall be reduced to one year.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor had on this occasion introduced a bill making all\r\nmilitary service uniformly two years, and abolishing the privileges\r\nthat had been granted to a few favored classes.\r\n\r\nFor this action they were severely criticised in the next party\r\nconvention. Bebel replied: \"I said, _if the Fatherland really must be\r\ndefended_, then we will defend it. Because it is our Fatherland. It is\r\nthe land in which we live, whose language we speak, whose culture we\r\npossess. Because we wish to make this, our Fatherland, more beautiful\r\nand more complete than any other land on earth. We defend it,\r\ntherefore, not for you but against you.\"[49] This patriotic\r\ndeclamation was received with \"tremendous applause.\"\r\n\r\nVon Vollmar, himself a soldier of distinction, said, in the Bavarian\r\nDiet, a few years ago:\r\n\r\n\"If the necessity should arise for the protection of the realm against\r\nforeign invasion, then it will become evident that the Social\r\nDemocrats love their Fatherland no less than do their neighbors; that\r\nthey will as gladly and heroically offer themselves to its defense. On\r\nthe other hand, if the foolish notion should ever arise to use the\r\narmy for the support of a warring class prerogative, for the defense\r\nof indefeasible demands, and for the crushing of those just ambitions\r\nwhich are the product of our times, and a necessary concomitant of our\r\neconomic and political development,--then we are of the firm\r\nconviction that the day will come when the army will remember that it\r\nsprang from the people, and that its own interests are those of the\r\nmasses.\"\r\n\r\nThis makes their position very clear.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nThe party that for years held itself in disdainful aloofness, was so\r\ndefiant of co-operation, in the national parliament, is ductile,\r\nneighborly, and eager to help in the municipal and communal councils.\r\nIt has a communal program of practical details, and no small part of\r\nthe splendid progress in municipal administration in Germany is due to\r\nthe Social Democrats. Everywhere you hear praise from officials and\r\nfrom political rivals for the careful work of the Social Democratic\r\nmembers of municipal bodies.\r\n\r\nOwing to the unfavorable election laws, the Social Democrats do not\r\nelect a large number of members to local councils. In no important\r\ncity do they preponderate. If universal manhood suffrage were enacted,\r\nthey would control the majority of the local legislative bodies. As it\r\nis, they are an active minority, and guard jealously the interests of\r\nthe working classes.\r\n\r\nMunich may be taken as the type of city in which the Social Democrats\r\nare active.[50]\r\n\r\nIn 1907 there were 130,000 qualified electors for the Reichstag\r\nelection in Munich, in 1905 there were only 31,252 qualified electors\r\nfor the municipal elections. This shows the restrictive influence of\r\nproperty qualifications for local elections.\r\n\r\nIn a city council of 60 members, the Social Democrats elected only 9.\r\nAnd of 20 elected members of the chamber of magistrates they elected\r\nonly 3.\r\n\r\nThis minority is an active committee of scrutiny. It carefully and\r\nminutely scrutinizes all the acts of the municipal authorities,\r\nespecially pertaining to labor, to contracts for public work, and to\r\nthe conditions of city employees. They vote consistently in favor of\r\nthe enlargement of municipal powers; e.g., the extension of parks, of\r\nstreet-car lines, the building of larger markets. For a number of\r\nyears the Social Democrats of Munich have urged the utilizing of the\r\nwater power of the Isar, which rushes through the city. And the\r\nmunicipality is now utilizing some of this power.\r\n\r\nThe Social Democrats also favor every facility for the extension of\r\nthe art and culture for which Munich is justly celebrated. They take\r\nno narrow, provincial views of such questions, and set an example that\r\nmight with profit be followed by parties who claim for themselves the\r\nprerogative of culture. They are constantly working for better public\r\neducational facilities, and are especially hostile to the\r\nencroachments of the Church upon the domain of public education.\r\n\r\nThey are in favor of increased public expenditures; opposed to all\r\nindirect taxes, especially those that tend to raise the price of food.\r\n\r\nTheir special grievance is the property qualification required for\r\nvoting. They say that a law which allows only one-fifteenth of the\r\ncitizens (30,000 out of over 500,000) a right to vote is \"shameful,\"\r\nand they are bending every effort to change the law.\r\n\r\nWhat is true in Munich is true in other cities: democratic election\r\nlaws are denied them. But they are active everywhere, and do not\r\ndespise the doing of small details, doing them well and with zest. It\r\nis obvious that Socialism in Germany cannot be put to a constructive\r\ntest until the election laws are democratized and the higher\r\nadministrative offices are opened to them. That will bring the real\r\ntest of this colossal movement.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe may sum it all up by saying that Social Democracy in Germany is\r\nfirst of all a struggle for democracy. The accent is on the second\r\npart of the compound. It is, secondly, a struggle for the\r\nself-betterment of the working classes; and it is, thirdly, a protest\r\nagainst certain conditions that the present organization of society\r\nimposes upon mankind.\r\n\r\nAn American sojourning among the German people must be impressed with\r\nthe painstaking organization of the empire. Every detail of life is\r\ncarefully ordered to avoid waste and to secure efficiency, even at the\r\ncost of individual initiative. This military empire, of infinite\r\ndiscipline, is now undergoing a political metamorphosis. The force\r\nthat is bringing about the change is being generated at the bottom of\r\nthe social strata, not at the top. This signifies that a change is\r\nsure to come.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] See MEYER, _Emancipations-Kampf des Vierten Standes_, Chap. V;\r\nalso J.

In\r\nBerlin in one precinct one man paid one-third of the taxes and\r\nconsequently possessed one-third of the legislative influence in that\r\nprecinct. In another precinct the president of a large bank paid\r\none-third of the taxes, and two of his associates paid another third.\r\nThese three men named the member of the Diet from that precinct.\r\n\r\n[19] For the struggle for ballot reform in Bavaria, see _Der Kampf um\r\ndie Wahlreform in Bayern_, issued in 1905 by the Bavarian Social\r\nDemocratic Party Executive Committee.\r\n\r\n[20] February 13, 1910, was set aside as a day for suffrage\r\ndemonstration throughout the empire. In Berlin alone forty-two\r\nmeetings were announced. These provoked the following edict: \"Notice!\r\nThe 'right to the streets' is hereby proclaimed. The streets serve\r\nprimarily for traffic. Resistance to state authority will be met by\r\nthe force of arms. I warn the curious. Berlin, February 13, 1910.\r\nPolice-president, VON IAGOW.\" The Social Democratic papers called\r\nattention to the fact that these notices were printed on the same\r\nforms that the Police-president often used to announce that the\r\nstreets would be closed to all traffic on account of military parades.\r\n\r\n[21] _Protokoll_, 1890, pp. 119-120.\r\n\r\n[22] _Protokoll_, 1890, pp. 96-7.\r\n\r\n[23] There are eight secretaries elected. They are distributed, by\r\ncustom, among the parties, according to their voting strength. The\r\nSocial Democrats had always refrained from taking part in any of the\r\nelections; now they enter the lists, abstaining from voting for any\r\ncandidate except their own--who, in turn, received no other votes.\r\n\r\n[24] Bebel was not present in the Reichstag at the time this vote was\r\ntaken, but he told the convention that, had he been present, he should\r\nhave supported the Tax Bill. _Protokoll_, 1908, p. 364.\r\n\r\n[25] _Protokoll_, 1892, p. 173.\r\n\r\n[26] _Protokoll_, 1910, p. 469.\r\n\r\n[27] _Protokoll_, 1910, p. 95.\r\n\r\n[28] Reichstag Debates, December 2, 1908.\r\n\r\n[29] In the election of January, 1912, the Social Democrats carried\r\nevery district in Berlin excepting the one in which the Kaiser's\r\npalace is situated. Here a spirited contest took place. A second\r\nballot was made necessary between the Radicals and Social Democrats,\r\nand the Conservatives, throwing all their forces on to the Radical\r\nside, succeeded in keeping this last stronghold from their enemies.\r\nBut Herr Kaempf's majority was only 6 votes.\r\n\r\n[30] _Protokoll_, 1898, p. 89.\r\n\r\n[31] _Supra cit._, p. 90.\r\n\r\n[32] This controversy is known as the \"revisionist movement.\" The\r\nrevisionists' position is set forth in Bernstein's book, _Die\r\nVoraussetzung des Sozialismus und die Aufgaben der Sozial-Demokratie_.\r\nThe Marxian position is set forth in Kautsky's reply, _Bernstein und\r\ndie Sozial-Demokratie_.

He closed by saying, \"We are the coming ones, ours is the\r\nfuture in spite of all things and everything.\"--_Protokoll_, 1907, p.\r\n323.\r\n\r\n[38] One of the veteran party leaders answered my question as to the\r\npresent-day influence of Marx as follows: \"The bulk of our party have\r\nnever read Marx. It takes a well-trained mind to understand him.\r\nConditions have entirely changed since his day, and we are busy with\r\nquestions of which Marx never dreamed and of which he could not\r\nforetell. He laid the philosophical basis for our party, but our party\r\nis practical, not philosophical.\"\r\n\r\n[39] In 1900 Bebel proposed the necessity of a working coalition with\r\nother parties in Prussia to gain electoral reform. He said: \"We cannot\r\nstand alone. We must attempt to go hand in hand with certain elements\r\nin the bourgeois parties--without, however, endangering our identity.\"\r\nBut the party was not willing to go as far as the veteran, and a\r\nresolution was adopted limiting such co-operation strictly to Prussia\r\nand giving the central committee full power to veto the acts any\r\nelectoral district might take in this direction.\r\n\r\n[40] _Protokoll_, 1910, p. 249.\r\n\r\n[41] _Protokoll_, 1910, p. 272.\r\n\r\n[42] In November, 1911, Berlin's new city hall was dedicated. The\r\nmembers of the city council were invited to be present. The Social\r\nDemocrats cast a large majority of all the votes in Berlin. But the\r\nSocial Democrats refused to attend the ceremonies. The program, as\r\npublished, called for a \"Hoch!\" to the Kaiser, and the Social\r\nDemocrats never joined in public approval of the government.\r\n_Vorwaerts_, the leading Social Democratic daily, said that Social\r\nDemocrats have nothing to do with such a display of \"Byzantinism.\" \"If\r\nany one thought it necessary to shout 'Hoch!' he could shout 'Hoch!'\r\nto the working population of Berlin.\"\r\n\r\n[43] _Protokoll_, 1907, pp. 227-8.\r\n\r\n[44] Amongst the business people of Mannheim, Munich, and other cities\r\nin Baden, Bavaria, and Hesse, there are many who support the Social\r\nDemocratic candidates, because, they say, there is no genuinely\r\nliberal party. It should, however, be borne in mind that the Social\r\nDemocrats of these southern districts are liberal and progressive, not\r\nthe unbending, orthodox variety of Prussia.\r\n\r\n[45] VON VOLLMAR, _Ueber die Aufgaben der Deutschen Social-Demokratie_.\r\n\r\n[46] The _Hansa Bund_ (Hanseatic League), organized a few years ago,\r\nmay be the nucleus of such a party.

And\r\njust as the continents were centuries in settling themselves to their\r\nnew conditions, so human society is now slowly adjusting itself to the\r\nconditions wrought by this violent change. One of the evidences of\r\nthis gradual readjustment is Socialism. For to Socialism machine\r\nindustry is a condition precedent. In this sense England has produced\r\nmodern Socialism.\r\n\r\nThere is no blacker picture than the England of 1780 to 1840, and no\r\ndrearier contrast than the quaint villages and their household\r\nindustries of the earlier period and the \"spreading of the hideous\r\ntown,\" after Arkwright and Hargreaves and Watt. These inhuman\r\nconditions are faithfully and dispassionately revealed in the reports\r\nof the various Royal Commissions of Inquiry: statistical mines where\r\nMarx and Engels found abundant material for their philosophy of gloom.\r\nAnd from these dull and depressing government folios Charles Kingsley\r\ndrew his indignant invectives, and Carlyle his trenchant indictments\r\nagainst a society that would imprison its eight-year-old children,\r\nits mothers, and its grandmothers in dingy factories fourteen hours a\r\nday for the sake of profits, and then release them at night only to\r\nfind lodgings in the most miserable hovels and rickety tenements. It\r\nis almost surprising to one familiar with the details of this gruesome\r\nrecord that a social revolution did not follow immediately in the wake\r\nof the industrial revolution.\r\n\r\nThere were riots at first, and machines were smashed. But the hand of\r\nthe worker was impotent against the arm of steel. The workman soon\r\nresigned himself to his fate and his misery. The poor laws did not\r\nhelp, they only multiplied the burdens upon the state without taking\r\nthe load from the poor. The laborer was too helpless to help himself,\r\nand the state and society were apathetic. The rapid expansion of\r\nindustry found an ample outlet in the growing commerce to every corner\r\nof the world. England was making money. She was gradually shifting\r\ncontrol from the traditional landowner to the new factory owner. The\r\nlanded gentry had inherited a fine sense of patriarchal\r\nresponsibility. The factory owner had no traditions. He was a parvenu.\r\nHis interests were machinery and ships, not politics and humanity. He\r\nacquiesced in the poor laws as the easiest way out of a miserable\r\nmess; he let private charity take its feeble and intermittent course,\r\npaying his rates and giving his donations with self-satisfied\r\nsanctity.\r\n\r\nAll this time labor was abundant. The markets of the world were hungry\r\nfor the goods of English mills. Then came suddenly the Chartist\r\nMovement.[1] The flame of discontent spread and a revolution seemed\r\nimpending. This first great outbreak of English labor was a political\r\nmovement, fed by economic causes. The repeal of the corn laws and the\r\npassage of the factory acts modified economic conditions and mollified\r\nlabor for the time. The repeal of the corn laws brought cheaper food;\r\nthe factory acts brought better conditions of labor.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile individualism was evolving an economic creed. The Manchester\r\ndoctrine was the logical outcome of England's insular position and her\r\ndriving individualistic manufactures. But it was _laissez-faire_ in\r\nindustrialism, not in unionism. The laboring men were now beginning to\r\norganize, and Cobden himself proposed the act that made unionism\r\nineffective as a political force. However, indirectly, free trade\r\nstimulated labor, because it brought great prosperity, made work\r\nabundant, and employers sanguine. Unions now rapidly multiplied, but\r\nthey were local, isolated. Their federation into a great national body\r\ncame later.\r\n\r\nSocialism, or unionism, or any other general movement cannot develop\r\nin England with the rapidity and enthusiasm that is shown for\r\n\"movements\" on the Continent. The traditions of the English people are\r\nconstitutional. Socialism can thrive among them only if it is\r\n\"constitutional,\" and the Fabians are to-day talking about\r\n\"constitutional Socialism\" with judicial solemnity. All the training\r\nof the English people is contrary to the theory of progress through\r\nviolence. They have had few revolutions accompanied by bloodshed, they\r\nhave had a great many accompanied by prayers and Parliamentary\r\noratory--\"constitutional\" methods. They have, moreover, a real\r\nreverence for property. The poor who have none are taught to respect\r\nthe rich who have. The Church, the common law, the statute law, the\r\ncustoms, all the sources of tradition and habit, have emphasized the\r\nsanctity of property. Only within the last few decades, as will be\r\nseen presently, has a radical change, a veritable revolution, come\r\nover the people in this respect.\r\n\r\nThe British temperament is not given to nerves. This stolid,\r\nphlegmatic, self-contained individualist has no inflammable material\r\nin his heart. Ruskin failed to arouse him, he wove too much artistry\r\ninto his appeal; and Carlyle could not move him, his epigrams were too\r\nrhapsodical. Such temperaments are not given to rapid propagandism.\r\nAnd finally, the Englishman is too practical to be a utopist. He\r\nconcerns himself with the duties of to-day rather than the vagaries of\r\nto-morrow. Utopianism made no impression on him. Owen, the great\r\nUtopian, was a Welshman. The Celt has imagination. Nor do intricate\r\ntheories or involved philosophies touch the mind of the Briton. The\r\nsplendor that enraptures the Frenchman, the abstruse reasoning that\r\ndelights the German, are alike boredom to this practical inventor of\r\nmachinery and builder of ships.\r\n\r\nIn spite of these characteristics there is no country in Europe where\r\nthere is more agitation about Socialism than there is in England\r\nto-day. It is discussed everywhere. Almost the entire time of\r\nParliament during the past few years has been taken up with more or\r\nless \"Socialistic\" legislation. The public mind is steeped in it.\r\n\r\nThere is more actually being done in England toward the\r\n\"socialization\" of property, and the state, than in any other European\r\ncountry. And less being said about the theory of value, the class\r\nwar, capitalistic production, proletariat and bourgeois, and the\r\nother Continental pet phrases of Socialism.\r\n\r\nMarx, who lived among the English for many years, but whose heart was\r\nnever with them, would not call this rapid social movement\r\nSocialistic, because it does not avowedly \"aim\" at \"socializing\r\ncapitalistic production.\" The doings of the English are certainly not\r\naccomplished in the spirit of his orthodoxy. But the current toward\r\nstate control, toward pure democracy, land nationalization,\r\nnationalization of railways and mines, has set in with the swiftness\r\nof a mill-race and is grinding grist with an amazing rapidity.\r\n\r\nAs I write these words, London and the whole country are wrought up\r\nover Lloyd George's Insurance Bill and the projected ballot reform\r\nbill. Meetings everywhere, fervid Parliamentary debate, the papers\r\nfilled with letters from everybody; every organization, debating\r\nsociety, and board of directors of great industries passing\r\nresolutions. Even the Labor Party is divided over the paternalistic\r\nmeasure that aims to bring relief to the sick and disabled working man\r\nand woman. Amidst all this discussion, noise, and party zeal is\r\ndiscerned the drift of the nation toward a new and unexpected goal.\r\n\r\nNowhere is it so difficult to define a Socialist, or to mark\r\nboundaries to the movement. But why mark shore-lines? The flood is on.\r\nI will here take the position that whatever extends the functions of\r\nthe state (community) over property, or into activities formerly left\r\nto individuals or to the home, is an indication of the Socialistic\r\ntrend. Old-fashioned Socialists like Keir Hardie are constantly\r\nwarning the people that what is now going on in England is only social\r\nreform, not Socialism. The Fabians, on the other hand, are exerting\r\nevery effort to add to the swiftness of the present movement.\r\n\r\nTo a student of democracy things now passing into law, and events now\r\nshaping into history, in England, are of peculiar significance. Such\r\nevents, transpiring in a country so long abandoned to a rampant\r\nindividualism, are portents of a newer time. They are signals of\r\napproaching changes to America, to us who have inherited the common\r\nlaw, the governmental traditions, the democratic ideals of liberty, if\r\nnot the substantial stolidity of temperament and self-complacent\r\negoism of the Briton.\r\n\r\nAll parties, Socialists and Conservatives, will admit this: that all\r\nthis turmoil, these rapidly succeeding general elections, these public\r\ndiscussions, these new laws, indicate that a new social ideal is being\r\nformed. That in itself is worthy of consideration. For the ideal will\r\nshape the destiny.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nPresent-day Socialism in England seems to have risen to sudden\r\nmagnitude from vacuity, to have permeated this cautious island over\r\nnight. For over a generation all Socialism had disappeared from view.\r\nThe elaborate schemes of Owen, the altruistic propaganda under the\r\ngentle Kingsley and his noble companion Maurice, the artistic revolt\r\nagainst the ugliness of commercialism led by Ruskin, who even shared\r\nthe toil of the breakers of stones to prove his sincerity--all these\r\nmovements seem suddenly to have disappeared from the face of the\r\nisland, like a glacial current dropping suddenly, without warning,\r\ninto the depths of the Moulin.\r\n\r\nEngland was given over to a highly prosperous industrialism. The\r\nManchester doctrine was enthroned. Commercialism and a glittering\r\npseudo-humanitarian internationalism found expression in the\r\nalternating victories of the astute Disraeli and the grandiloquent\r\nGladstone.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile poverty and misery infested the underplaces of the land, a\r\npoverty and misery that was appalling. Every protester was proudly\r\npointed to the repeal of the corn laws, the revision of the poor laws,\r\nthe reform act of 1832, and the factory acts.\r\n\r\nWhen Sir Henry Vane had ascended the scaffold which his sacrifice made\r\nhistoric, he said: \"The people of England have long been asleep; when\r\nthey awake they will be hungry.\" When the England of to-day awoke it\r\nwas to a greater hunger than the politically starved Roundhead or\r\nCavalier ever endured.\r\n\r\nIt is no figure of speech to speak of hungry England. Its brilliant\r\nindustrialism has always had a drab background of want. Chiozza Money\r\nsays of the present position of labor: \"The aggregate income of the\r\n44,500,000 people in the United Kingdom in 1908-9 was approximately\r\nL1,844,000,000; 1,400,000 persons took L634,000,000; 4,100,000 persons\r\ntook L275,000,000; 39,000,000 persons took L935,000,000.\"[2] And he\r\nsums up the condition as follows: \"The position of the manual workers\r\nin relation to the general wealth of the country has not improved.\r\nThey formed, with those dependent upon them, the greater part of the\r\nnation in 1867, and they enjoyed but about forty per cent. of the\r\nnational income, according to the careful estimate of Dudley Baxter.\r\nTo-day, with their army of dependents, they still form the greater\r\npart of the nation, although not quite so great a part, and, according\r\nto the best information available, they take less than forty per cent.\r\nof the entire income of the nation.\" Although during this time the\r\nnational income had increased much faster than the rate of population,\r\n\"the Board of Trade, after a careful examination of the question of\r\nunemployment in 1904, arrived at the general conclusion that 'the\r\naverage level of employment during the last 4 years has been almost\r\nexactly the same as the average of the preceding 40 years.'\"[3]\r\n\r\nWhile the general level of wage-earners has been maintained, and while\r\nwealth has greatly increased, the poverty of the kingdom has shown\r\nlittle tendency to diminish. \"As for pauperism, it is difficult to\r\ncongratulate ourselves upon improvement since 1867, when we remember\r\nthat in England and Wales alone 1,500,000 to 2,000,000 persons are in\r\nreceipt of relief in the course of a single year. This means _one\r\nperson in every 20_ has recourse to the poor-law guardians during a\r\nsingle year.\"\r\n\r\n\"If our national income had but increased at the same rate as our\r\npopulation since 1867, it would in 1908 have amounted to but about\r\nL1,200,000,000. As we have seen, it is now about L1,840,000,000. Yet\r\nthe Error in Distribution remains so great, that, while the total\r\npopulation in 1867 was 30,000,000, we have to-day a nation of\r\n30,000,000 poor people in our rich country, and many millions of these\r\nare living under conditions of degrading poverty. Of those above the\r\nline of primary poverty, millions are tied down by the conditions of\r\ntheir labor to live in surroundings which preclude the proper\r\nenjoyment of life or the proper raising of children.\"[4]\r\n\r\nAn event occurred in 1889 that aroused public opinion on the question\r\nof labor conditions. The dockers along the great wharves in London\r\nwent out on strike, and forced public attention upon the misery of\r\nthese most wretched of British workmen,[5] whose wages were so low\r\nthat they could not buy bread for their families and their employment\r\nwas so irregular that they were idle half of the time. John Burns came\r\ninto prominence first during this strike. He raised over $200,000 by\r\npublic appeals to support the strikers. General sympathy was with the\r\nmen; and the arbitrators to whom their grievances were submitted\r\nawarded most of their demands.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this strike was far-reaching. All over the kingdom\r\nunskilled labor was roused to its power, and a new era in labor\r\norganization began.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nIn no country has the labor-union movement achieved a greater degree\r\nof organization than in England.[6] The movement has been economic,\r\nturning to politics only in recent years; it concerned itself with\r\nwages and conditions of labor, not with party programs and\r\nParliamentary candidates.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic feature of English trade-unionism is collective\r\nbargaining, long since introduced into America, but unknown in most\r\nEuropean countries. The English unions also organized insurance\r\nsocieties called \"Friendly Societies.\"[7]\r\n\r\nFor many years the laws regulating labor unions had been liberally\r\nconstrued by the courts, and the unions had done very much as they\r\npleased. Two decisions have been rendered during the last decade that\r\nthreatened the unions' existence both as a political and economic\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nIn 1900 the Taff Vale Railway Company brought suit against the\r\nAmalgamated Society of Railway Servants, charging the men with\r\nconspiring to induce the workmen to break their contracts with the\r\ncompany. The court enjoined the union from picketing and from\r\ninterfering with the men in their contractual relations with the\r\nemploying company, and assessed the damages at $100,000 against the\r\noffending union. The House of Lords, sitting in final appeal, affirmed\r\nthe judgment of the trial court. This virtually meant the stopping of\r\nstrikes, for strikes without pickets and vigilance would usually be\r\nunavailing. It also meant financial bankruptcy.\r\n\r\nA second far-reaching decision was made by the House of Lords in\r\nDecember, 1909, when the \"Osborne Judgment\" was affirmed, granting to\r\none Osborne, a member of the Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants,\r\nan injunction restraining the union from making a levy on its members,\r\nand from using any of its funds for the purpose of maintaining any of\r\nits members, or any other person, in Parliament. The unions had taken\r\nit for granted that they had the legal right to contribute out of\r\ntheir funds to political campaigns, and to pay the labor members of\r\nParliament a salary out of the union treasury.[8] The court held such\r\npayments were illegal, on the ground that they were _ultra vires_. The\r\ncharter of the unions did not sanction it.[9]\r\n\r\nThe English workman has not only had the trade union for a training\r\nschool in practical affairs, but the co-operative movement began here;\r\nand here it flourishes, not as widely spread among the poorer workmen\r\nas in Belgium, but among the better-paid workers it is very popular.\r\n\r\nIt is singular that the only practical result left of Owen's\r\nstupendous plans was the little co-operative shop, opened in 1844 at\r\nRochdale, with a capital of $140 and a gross weekly income of $10.\r\nOwen did not start this shop, but a handful of his followers were the\r\npromoters of the tiny enterprise. The co-operative union to-day\r\nembraces wholesale, retail, productive, and special societies, with\r\nnearly 3,000,000 members, increasing at the rate of 70,000 a year, and\r\ndoing $550,000,000 worth of business annually.\r\n\r\nThere is also a rapidly growing co-partnership movement, especially in\r\nthe building of \"garden suburbs\" and tenements. In 1903 there were two\r\nsuch companies, with $200,000 worth of property. In 1909 they had\r\nincreased to 15 associations, with over $3,085,000 worth of property.\r\nThe membership is not confined to workingmen, but they form the\r\nbulk.[10]\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of the modern labor movement we see that the\r\nBritish workmen have shown a strong tendency to organize. Their\r\norganizations included at first only the skilled workers. There was a\r\ngulf between the trained worker and the unskilled worker. The latter,\r\nforming the substratum of poverty, were too abject for organizing.\r\n\r\nThese two great bodies of workers, skilled and unskilled, have been\r\ngradually brought together and their interests united. The Taff Vale\r\nand Osborne judgments have forced them into politics. The unskilled\r\nhave been given the benefit of the experience of the skilled, and a\r\nfair degree of homogeneity and group ambition has been reached.\r\n\r\nTo enter politics a new form of organization was necessary. We will\r\nsee how one was prepared for them.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nWe will now turn to the Socialist organizations. They are more\r\nnumerous than in the other countries we have studied, and more varied\r\nin color. But not any of them are as strong as the French or German\r\norganizations.\r\n\r\nIn 1880 William Morris and H.M. Hyndman, a personal friend of Marx,\r\norganized the \"Democratic Federation.\" For a few years it was the only\r\nSocialist organization. It split on the question of revolution. Morris\r\nand his friends, many of them inclined toward Anarchy, founded the\r\n\"Socialist League.\" This league has long since vanished. Hyndman and\r\nhis followers renamed their society the \"Social Democratic\r\nFederation.\" It still persists, under the name Social Democratic Party\r\n(popularly \"S.D.P.\"), and remains the only organized trace of\r\nmilitant, reactionary Marxianism in England. For a long time it\r\nrefrained from politics, advocated violence, and was the faithful\r\nimitator of the Guesdist party in France. These are doctrines and\r\nmethods that repel the English mind, and the Federation never has been\r\nstrong. It has a weekly paper, _Justice_, and a monthly paper, _The\r\nSocial Democrat_; claims one member in Parliament, elected however by\r\nthe Labor Party, and (in 1907) 124 members of various local governing\r\nbodies. Its aged leader, Hyndman, clings tenaciously to the dogmas of\r\nMarx, and all the changes that have come over the Socialist movement\r\nduring the last decades have not altered his views or methods.[11] The\r\nFederation's affiliations and sympathy have been with the\r\nInternational rather than the British movement, and until a few years\r\nago it monopolized British representation on the International\r\nExecutive Committee.\r\n\r\nSoon after Morris left the Federation a new and novel Socialist\r\nsociety was formed in London. Two Americans gave the impulse that\r\nstarted the movement--Henry George, through his works on Single Tax,\r\nand Thomas Davidson of New York, a gentle dreamer of the New\r\nTo-morrow. Henry George's books had been read by a group of young men\r\nin London, and when Dr. Davidson went there to lecture he found these\r\nyoung men ready to listen to his utopian generalizations. Soon these\r\nmen organized the Fabian Society. They were not sure of their ground,\r\nand took for their motto: \"For the right moment you must wait as\r\nFabius did when warring against Hannibal, though many censured his\r\ndelays; but when the time comes you must strike hard, as Fabius did,\r\nor your waiting will be in vain and fruitless.\"\r\n\r\nA number of brilliant young men soon joined the Fabians, and their\r\n\"tracts\" have become famous. Among their members they include Sidney\r\nWebb, the sociologist; George Bernard Shaw, the playwright and cynic;\r\nChiozza Money, statistician and member of Parliament; Rev. R.J.\r\nCampbell of the City Temple; Rev. Stewart Headlam, leader in the\r\nChurch Socialist Movement; and a horde of others, famous in letters,\r\nthe professions, and the arts.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to estimate the influence of this unique group of\r\npersonages, and it is very easy to underestimate it. From the first\r\nthey committed themselves to the policy of \"permeation,\" instead of\r\naggressive propaganda. They would transform the world by intellectual\r\nosmosis. They have, thus, not only contributed by far the most\r\nbrilliant literature to modern Socialism, but have touched some of the\r\ninner springs of political and social power. Prime ministers and\r\nborough councilmen, poor-law guardians and chancellors of the\r\nexchequer, have been influenced by the propulsion of their ideas. But\r\nit has all been done so noiselessly and so well disguised, that to the\r\nSocial Democratic Federation the Fabians are \"mere academicians,\" and\r\nto the Independent Labor Party they are forerunners of \"tyrannical\r\nbureaucracy.\"\r\n\r\nEleven Fabians are in Parliament, and they are not silent onlookers.\r\nFor years the Fabians have dominated the London County Council. Its\r\nbrilliant \"missionaries\" attract large audiences, and \"Fabian Essays\"\r\nhave passed through many editions. Each member of this society is the\r\ncreator of his own dogma. The Marxian formulas, especially the theory\r\nof surplus value, are not reverenced by them.\r\n\r\nEngland is the only country in Europe where there is a strong Church\r\nSocialist Movement. In 1889 the Christian Social Union was formed by\r\nmembers of the Church of England. It is not a Socialist organization,\r\nbut it has enlisted a wide practical interest in the labor movement.\r\nIt was the outgrowth of the Pan-Anglican Congress, which met at\r\nLambeth in 1888. At this conference a committee on Socialism made a\r\nnoteworthy report, recommending the bringing together of capital and\r\nlabor through the agency of co-operation and association.[12]\r\n\r\nIn 1906 \"The Church Socialist League\" was organized. \"It seeks to\r\nconvert the christened people of England to Socialism. Its members are\r\ncommitted to the definite economic Socialism of accredited Socialist\r\nbodies. The League is growing rapidly. Branches are springing up all\r\nover the country. Its members have addressed thousands of meetings on\r\nbehalf of both Socialist and labor candidates at Parliamentary and\r\nprincipal elections.... The members of the League are Socialists. They\r\nseek to establish a commonwealth in which the people shall own the\r\nland and industrial capital collectively and administer the same\r\ncollectively.\"[13]\r\n\r\nThe influence of the Church Socialist League and the Fabians has\r\nspread to the universities, especially to Oxford and Cambridge. A\r\nnumber of distinguished professors are active Socialists.\r\n\r\nThe movement thus gained ground more rapidly among the intellectuals\r\nthan among the workingmen. It was not until 1893 that a Socialist\r\nLabor Party was organized. The Social Democratic Federation was too\r\ndogmatic, hard, and bitter to draw the English laboring man; the\r\nFabians and the Church Socialists were avowedly not partisan. In 1893\r\na group of labor delegates met at Bradford and, under the leadership\r\nof Keir Hardie, organized the Independent Labor Party (I.L.P.). This\r\ndefinite step had been preceded by many local political organizations\r\namong labor unionists. The necessity for political activity had been\r\nfelt in many places. The Bradford convention was merely the coalescing\r\nof many local movements. The I.L.P. is a Socialist body, but it is not\r\ndogmatically, not obnoxiously so. It forms, rather, a connecting link\r\nbetween Socialism and labor unions.\r\n\r\nIt entered politics at once, but with discouraging results. Its 29\r\ncandidates polled only 63,000 votes; only 5 were elected. A closer\r\nalliance with the labor unions was necessary. This was accomplished\r\nwhen the unions, in 1899, appointed a Labor Representative Committee,\r\nwhose duty it was, as the name implies, to increase labor's\r\nrepresentation in Parliament.[14] This committee had first to\r\ndetermine its relation to the other political parties. The Liberals\r\nand Conservatives among the laborites were outvoted, and the committee\r\ndetermined upon a new course. Representatives from the Socialist\r\nbodies--the I.L.P., S.D.F., and Fabians--were asked to join the unions\r\nin an alliance that should use its united strength in electing members\r\nto Parliament. All agreed, but the S.D.F. soon withdrew.\r\n\r\nIn 1906 the name of the committee was changed to the Labor Party. It\r\nis founded upon the broadest basis of co-operation, so that neither\r\nSocialist, no matter how radical, nor non-Socialist should find it\r\nimpossible to work with the party. Its constitution defines this\r\ncoalition: \"The Labor Party is a federation consisting of Trade\r\nUnions, Trade Councils, Socialist Societies, and Local Labor Parties.\"\r\n\"Co-operative Societies are also eligible,\" as are \"national\r\norganizations of women accepting the basis of this constitution and\r\nthe policy of the party.\"\r\n\r\nThe object of the party is \"to secure the election of candidates to\r\nParliament and to organize and maintain a Labor Party with its own\r\nwhips and policy.\"\r\n\r\nParty rigor is carefully prescribed: \"Candidates and members must\r\naccept this constitution and agree to abide by the decisions of the\r\nParliamentary party in carrying out the aims of this constitution;\r\nappear before their constituents under the title of labor candidates;\r\nabstain strictly from identifying themselves with or promoting the\r\ninterests of any Parliamentary party not affiliated, or its\r\ncandidates; and they must not oppose any candidate recognized by the\r\nnational executive of the party.\" \"Before a candidate can be regarded\r\nas adopted for a constituency, his candidature must be sanctioned by\r\nthe national executive.\"\r\n\r\nThe party, thus centrally controlled, is well organized in every part\r\nof the kingdom. It maintains a fund for paying the election expenses\r\nof its members.[15] The Osborne judgment has been a serious setback to\r\nthe party, especially in local elections. The payment of members was\r\nvoted in 1911 by Parliament as a partial remedy, and the government\r\nhas promised a reform election bill that will impose the burden of all\r\nnecessary election expenses upon the state.\r\n\r\nThe party membership has grown from 375,000 in 1900 to nearly\r\n1,500,000 in 1912. Such leading members of the party as J. Ramsay\r\nMacDonald, Keir Hardie, Philip Snowden, and over one-half of the\r\nParliamentary group, are Socialists. The party refused to commit\r\nitself to Socialistic principles until 1907, when it declared itself\r\nin favor of the following resolution: \"The socialization of the means\r\nof production, distribution, and exchange to be controlled in a\r\ndemocratic state in the interests of the entire community, and the\r\ncomplete emancipation of labor from the domination of capitalism and\r\nlandlordism, with the establishment of social and economic equality\r\nbetween the sexes.\"[16]\r\n\r\nIn 1908 the party had 26 members in county councils, 262 in town\r\ncouncils, 168 in urban district councils, 27 in rural district\r\ncouncils, 124 in parish councils, 145 on poor-law boards, 23 on school\r\nboards. There are (1910) about 1,500 labor men and Socialist members\r\non the various local governing bodies in Great Britain.[17]\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nWe see, then, that Socialism and trades-unionism in England coalesced.\r\nBut a more important confluence of political ideals was soon to occur.\r\n\r\nThe elections of 1906 indicated to the people of England that a new\r\nforce had entered the domain of political power, which had so long\r\nbeen assigned to the gentry and men of wealth. A careful observer of\r\npolitical events, and a member of Parliament, described the results as\r\nfollows: \"When the present House of Commons (1907) was completed in\r\nJanuary last, and it was discerned that 50 labor members had been\r\nelected, a cry of wonder went up from press and public. People wrote\r\nand spoke as if these 50 members were the forerunners of a political\r\nand social revolution; as if the old party divisions were completely\r\nworn out, and as if power were about to pass to a new political party\r\nthat would represent the masses as opposed to the classes. These fears\r\nor hopes were reflected in the House of Commons itself. During the\r\nearly months of the session the Labor Party received from all quarters\r\nof the House an amount of deference that would have been described as\r\nsycophantic if it had been directed towards an aristocratic instead of\r\ntowards a democratic group.\"[18] The tidal wave of reaction following\r\nthe Boer war had swept the Liberal Party into power, and had given\r\nfifty seats to the Labor Party. The effect was nothing short of\r\nrevolutionary.\r\n\r\nDisraeli, in his _Sibyl_, spoke of \"two nations,\" two Englands, the\r\nEngland of the gentry and the England of the working classes. The\r\nelections since the Boer war have given this \"other England\" its\r\nchance. The gentry, the Whigs and Tories, will never again fight their\r\npolitical jousts with the \"other England\" looking contentedly on. This\r\n\"mass mind of organized labor\" has become the \"new controlling force\r\nin progressive politics.\"[19]\r\n\r\nThe \"transformed England\" began to see evidences of the change. The\r\nfirst bill brought in by the Labor Party provided for the feeding of\r\nschool children, from the homes of the poor, out of public funds. \"The\r\nbusiness in life of my colleagues and myself is to impress upon this\r\nHouse the importance of the poverty problem,\" said the spokesman of\r\nthe Labor Party in an important debate.[20]\r\n\r\nEngland had awakened hungry.\r\n\r\nNow occurred the most significant political event in the history of\r\nmodern England. The Liberal Party took over the immediate program of\r\nthe Labor Party. This is significant because it swept England away\r\nfrom her industrial moorings of individualistic _laissez-faire_, and\r\nextended the functions of the state into activities that had hitherto\r\nbeen left to individual initiative. A complete revolution had taken\r\nplace since Cobden's day. The state acknowledged new social and\r\neconomic obligations. In the Parliamentary struggle that followed\r\nhereditary prerogative in property was undermined and hereditary\r\nprerogative in government virtually destroyed, and the principles of\r\ndemocracy enormously extended.[21]\r\n\r\nIn England the question of co-operation between Socialists and other\r\nparties has been more important than in any other European country:\r\nbecause in a democratic parliament concessions are always made to\r\nlarge portions of the electorate by the parties in power, and because\r\nthe practical temperamental qualities of the British discard the\r\nfine-drawn distinctions between groups and sub-groups that are so\r\nassiduously maintained in France and Germany.\r\n\r\nIn the Amsterdam Congress of The International the question was\r\ndiscussed whether Socialists should act with other parties. Jaures and\r\nhis _bloc_ were the occasion of the debate. Kautsky said that in times\r\nof national crises like war it might be necessary for Socialists to\r\nco-operate with the government to insure national safety. No such\r\nextraordinary standard has ever existed among practical Englishmen,\r\nwho usually know what they want, and are not particular about the\r\nmeans of getting it.\r\n\r\nWilliam Morris, uncompromising dogmatist, inveighed against the Whigs\r\nin 1886 as \"the Harlequins of Reaction.\" Democracy was his ideal of\r\ngovernment, and he was not entirely averse to political action on the\r\npart of Socialists. \"To capture Parliament, and turn it into a popular\r\nbut constitutional assembly, is, I must conclude, the aspiration of\r\nthe genuine democrats wherever they may be found.\"\r\n\r\nBut he was wary of compromise. \"Some democrats take up actual pieces\r\nof Socialism, the nationalization of land, or of railways, or\r\ncumulative taxation of incomes, or limiting the right of inheritance,\r\nor new patent laws, or the restriction by law of the day's labor....\r\nAll this I admit and say is a hopeful sign, and yet once again I say\r\nthere is a snare in it.... A snake lies lurking in the grass.\" \"Those\r\nwho think they can deal with our present system in this piecemeal way\r\nvery much underrate the strength of the tremendous organization under\r\nwhich we live, and which appoints to each of us his place, and, if we\r\ndo not choose to fit it, grinds us down until we do.\"[22]\r\n\r\nMorris' advice, \"Beware the Whigs,\" was uttered at a time when the\r\nleader of that party, Gladstone, was beginning to see that the chief\r\nevent of the century would be the merging of the social question with\r\npolitics. The \"piecemeal\" method that Morris decried became the actual\r\nmethod of Parliamentary activity as soon as a new party, a third\r\nparty, arose and drew its inspiration from the working classes.\r\n\r\nSuch a party was anticipated. Lord Rosebery said in 1894: \"I am\r\ncertain there is a party in this country, unnamed as yet, that is\r\ndisconnected with any existing political organization--a party that is\r\ninclined to say, 'A plague on both your houses, a plague on all your\r\npolitics, a plague on all your unending discussions that yield so\r\nlittle fruit.'\"[23] And the same year John (now Lord) Morley\r\nprophesied: \"Now I dare say the time may come, it may come sooner than\r\nsome think, when the Liberal Party will be transformed or superseded\r\nby some new party.\"[24] And Professor Dicey, over a decade ago, spoke\r\nof the waning orthodoxy of Liberalism and its rapid merging into\r\nSocialism.\r\n\r\nThe \"piecemeal\" party of Morris, the \"transformed\" party of Morley,\r\nthe radicalized party of Dicey, is the Liberal Party of to-day. The\r\n\"unnamed\" party of Rosebery is the Labor Party, which not only says,\r\n\"A plague upon all your discussions,\" but, \"A plague upon all your\r\nfine-spun theories of class war--it's results we want.\"\r\n\r\nBefore detailing some of the significant acts of this new democratic\r\ncoalition, it should be added that the motive of the Liberal Party has\r\nnot been unmixed with politics. The Labor Party possesses not only the\r\n30 or 40 votes in the House of Commons; there are hundreds of\r\nthousands of labor votes outside. This background of silent, vigilant\r\nvoters forms the greatest force of the Labor Party. Many Liberal\r\nmembers hold their seats by its favor.\r\n\r\nThere are in both the great parties men with strong sympathies for the\r\nlabor ideal. In fact, a number of Socialists are sitting with the\r\nLiberals. There is no clear demarcation. It is only a difference of\r\nthe degree of infusion.\r\n\r\nThe Labor Party has had a strong influence upon the House of Commons.\r\nFor many years the \"Government\" has ruled quite arbitrarily. When\r\nthere are only two parties this is possible. But when an influential\r\nthird party appears on the scene, government by the \"front benchers\"\r\nmust be moderated.[25]\r\n\r\nThe \"cross benchers\" have wrested a good deal of power from the\r\nleaders. This is necessary in a democracy which is kept alive only by\r\ncontact with the people. There is more government by the Commons, and\r\nless government by the ministry. This _entente_ can degenerate into\r\nParliamentary tyranny if it wishes. It can demand the cloture, as well\r\nas open the valves of useless debate. But an arbitrary act\r\nunsanctioned by the cross benchers would be likely to bring\r\ndestruction upon the government that perpetrated it.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nA review of the Acts of Parliament since the Liberal-Labor coalition\r\nand a perusal of the debates are convincing proof of the character of\r\nthe new legislation and the opinions that prompt it. We must confine\r\nourselves to a few types of this legislation, enough to show the\r\nactual changes now in process.\r\n\r\nThe first bill introduced by the Labor Party, and enacted into law,\r\nauthorized the providing of meals for poor children in the schools. It\r\ndoes not make this compulsory, but under its sanction in 1909 over\r\n$670,000 were spent in providing over 16,000,000 meals. Nearly half of\r\nthese were in London.[26] This law is especially assailed by the\r\nanti-Socialists. They claim its administration has been too lenient,\r\nnot discriminating between the needy and those capable of self-help.\r\nIt is only the entering wedge of Socialism, they say; it is only a\r\nstep from feeding the child to clothing him, and from feeding and\r\nclothing the child to caring for the parent. They recall that Sidney\r\nWebb has often said that if the city furnishes water free to its\r\ncitizens it should be able to furnish milk as well.\r\n\r\nThe second bill introduced by the Labor Party was the Trades Dispute\r\nAct. This was framed to annul the Taff Vale decision, making the\r\nunions immune from suits for tortious acts and providing an elaborate\r\nsystem of arbitrating labor disputes. The provisions of this act were\r\ntested by two railway crises. In 1907 the railway employees threatened\r\nto go out on strike. Lloyd George, then president of the Board of\r\nTrade, averted the strike by enlisting all the power of the government\r\nin persuading the companies and the men to agree to a scheme of\r\narbitration. This was to last a stipulated term of years, but before\r\nthe time had elapsed the men actually struck (1911), and for a week\r\nthe country was in a panic. Lloyd George, then Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer, again used all the power of the government to bring peace,\r\nand a commission was appointed to investigate the grievances of the\r\nmen, who had agreed to abide by its decision. In this way the\r\ngovernment has become the most active force in settling labor\r\ndisputes--a subject that was formerly left to the two parties of the\r\nlabor contract.\r\n\r\nA Workman's Compensation Act and an Old-Age Pension Act soon followed.\r\nThe latter provides a pension for all workmen who are 70 years old.\r\nUnlike the German act, the government provides all the funds. In 1909\r\nthe Labor Exchange Act empowered the Board of Trade to establish labor\r\nexchanges. These have been established in every city. At first there\r\nwas some friction with the unions because \"blacklegs\" were assigned to\r\nplaces. But since union men have been invited to sit on the local\r\ngoverning committees, things are running smoother.\r\n\r\nThere are three laws which show the trend of the changing relation of\r\nthe state to property.\r\n\r\nThe Development Act of 1909 provides for the appointment of five\r\ncommissioners, upon whose recommendation the Treasury advances money\r\nto any governmental department or public authority or university or\r\nassociation of persons for the purpose of aiding agriculture and rural\r\nindustries of all sorts; the reclamation of drainage lands and of\r\nforests; the general improvement of rural transportation, including\r\nthe building of \"light railways\"; the construction and improvement of\r\nharbors; the improvement of inland navigation, including the building\r\nof canals; and the development and improvement of fisheries. This law\r\nendows the government with the necessary authority for the absorption\r\nof virtually all the internal means of communication except the trunk\r\nrailways, and extends the paternal arm of the government over\r\nagriculture and the fisheries and subsidiary industries.[27] The\r\nfirst report of the commission, 1910-11, indicates that work under\r\nthis law has begun in earnest. A comprehensive plan of regeneration,\r\nembracing the entire kingdom and based on adequate surveys, is\r\noutlined. One of the interesting features of the plan is the proposal\r\nto do as much of the work as possible by direct labor rather than by\r\ncompetitive bidding. The commission wants to make sure \"that the funds\r\nshall not go into the pockets of private individuals.\"[28] Under an\r\nenthusiastic commission there will be practically no limit to the\r\ninfluence of this law.\r\n\r\nTwo other acts are closely allied with this scheme: the Small Holdings\r\nAct of 1908, and the Housing and Town Planning Act of 1909. The Small\r\nHoldings Act gives authority to county councils to \"provide small\r\nholdings for persons who desire to buy or lease and will themselves\r\ncultivate the holdings.\" This provision is extended to borough, urban,\r\ndistrict, and parish councils. These authorities may purchase such\r\nlands \"whether situate within or without their county.\"\r\n\r\nThe Town Planning Act gives cities and towns the power to purchase\r\nland and allot it, to tear down undesirable buildings, to co-operate\r\nwith any workingman's association for improving and erecting\r\ndwellings, and to buy the necessary land for making improvements of\r\nall kinds. John Burns, who stood sponsor for this bill, explained that\r\nit gave complete authority to local governing bodies \"to make a city\r\nhealthful and a city beautiful.\"\r\n\r\nFollowing the British habit, work has very cautiously begun under\r\nthese acts. Up to December, 1910, about 28,000 acres were purchased or\r\nleased under the allotment act, and sublet to 100,498 individual\r\ntenants. \"Town planning\" has progressed rapidly, and the regeneration\r\nof the British slums, the most dismal in the world, may be not far\r\ndistant.[29]\r\n\r\nUnder the Small Holdings Act there were, up to December, 1910, nearly\r\n31,000 applicants, asking for over 500,000 acres. Only one-fifth of\r\nthis amount was acquired, for 7,000 holders. Thirty per cent. of the\r\napplicants are agricultural laborers, and the majority of the others\r\nare drawn from the rural population who have some small business or\r\ntrade in the villages and wish a plot of land for a garden. This\r\n\"often makes the difference between a bare subsistence and comparative\r\nprosperity.\"[30]\r\n\r\nThese laws show the drift of the current. The question of the\r\nnationalization of railways has been the subject of Parliamentary\r\ninquiry, and the great railway strike of 1911 emphasized the matter\r\nprofoundly. The state in 1911 completed the taking over of all the\r\ntelephone lines; it conducts an extensive postal savings bank and a\r\nparcels post.\r\n\r\nIn local affairs some British cities are models of municipal\r\nenterprise. Even London, that amorphous mass of human misery and\r\nopulence, is changing its aspect. Since the granting of municipal home\r\nrule it has built a vast system of street railways, cleaned out acres\r\nof slums, opened breathing spaces, built tenements, and in many other\r\nways displayed evidences of an awakening civic consciousness.\r\n\r\nThree other pieces of legislation must be described more in detail,\r\nbecause they are more revolutionary, far-reaching, and democratic than\r\nanything attempted by the British nation since the days of the Reform\r\nBill.\r\n\r\nFirst is the famous \"Budget\" of Lloyd George. When this virile\r\nWelshman became Chancellor of the Exchequer he cast his budget in the\r\nmold of his social theories. He said: \"Personally, I look on the\r\nBudget as a part only of a comprehensive scheme of fiscal and social\r\nreform: the setting up of a great insurance scheme for the unemployed\r\nand for the sick and infirm, and the creation, through the development\r\nbill, of the machinery for the regeneration of rural life.\"[31]\r\n\r\nThe land system of England is feudal. Tenure still legally exists.\r\nThere still clings the flavor of social and political distinction to\r\nfee simple. This the landowners have fortified against all the changes\r\nthat industrialism has wrought. There has been no general land\r\nappraisement since the Pilgrims landed at the new Plymouth. The \"land\r\nmonopoly\" successfully resisted every attack until the famous budget\r\nof 1908. Chiozza Money quotes John Bateman's analysis of the \"New\r\nDomesday Book,\" fixing the ownership of land in England and Wales as\r\nfollows:[32]\r\n\r\nIn 1883, in the United Kingdom, there was a total area of 77,000,000\r\nacres; of this 40,426,000 acres were owned by 2,500 persons. \"While\r\nthe total income of the nation is L1,840,000,000, the landowners take\r\nL106,000,000 as land rent.\"[33] England is a great industrial and\r\ncommercial nation living on leased land.\r\n\r\nThe development of the industrial towns has enormously multiplied the\r\nvalue of some of these vast estates.[34]\r\n\r\nThe new budget proposed, first, to tax the land values; not a\r\nfictitious sum, or the value of the land with improvements, but the\r\nsite value--the increment value with which the land is endowed because\r\nof its favorable location. Second, to this was added a 10 per cent.\r\nreversion duty. Third, a tax was levied on undeveloped land held for\r\nspeculative purposes. And, fourth, a 5 per cent. tax on mineral rights\r\nwas assessed on the owners of the land that contained the mines.\r\n\r\nThese proposals raised a storm. They aimed at the traditional\r\nstronghold of English aristocracy. The budget passed the House of\r\nCommons by a large majority; the Lords rejected it. The government\r\npromptly prorogued Parliament and went before the people. And what was\r\nat first only an attack upon hereditary rights in land became an\r\nattack also upon hereditary rights in politics. The House of Lords\r\nbecame an issue as well as the budget. After a fiery and furious\r\ncampaign, in which Socialists and Laborites joined Radicals and\r\nLiberals, the budget won by a safe majority.[35] The Lords passed the\r\nmeasure. But this resistance cost them dear. One of the first\r\nprerogatives established by the House of Commons was the right to\r\ncontrol the purse-strings of the kingdom. Custom has given the\r\nsanction of constitutionality to this prerogative. And the Lords, in\r\nfirst denying and then delaying the budget, laid themselves open to\r\nthe charge of \"hereditary arrogance\" and \"unconstitutionalism.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the passage of the budget there followed six months of\r\nconference between the two front benches, to find a basis of reform\r\nfor the House of Lords upon which all could unite. When it became\r\nevident that this was impossible, the government again prorogued\r\nParliament and went to the people for a mandate on the question of\r\n\"reforming the Lords.\" The Liberals and their allies were, for a third\r\ntime, returned to power, and in February, 1911, the Prime Minister,\r\nMr. Asquith, introduced his \"Parliament Bill,\" taking from the House\r\nof Lords the power to amend a money bill so as to change its\r\ncharacter. If any other bill passed by the Commons is rejected by the\r\nLords, the Commons can pass it over their veto; and if this is done in\r\nthree consecutive sessions of the same Parliament--provided two years\r\nelapse between the introduction of the bill and its third rejection by\r\nthe Lords--it becomes a law. The law is intended as a preliminary\r\nmeasure. The preamble states that it is the intention of the\r\ngovernment to provide for a second chamber \"constituted on a popular\r\ninstead of hereditary basis.\" The bill was so amended by the Lords as\r\nto change its character and returned to the Commons. The Prime\r\nMinister then informed the leaders of the opposition that the King,\r\n\"upon the advice of his ministers,\" had consented to create enough\r\npeers to insure the passage of the bill in its original form. Rather\r\nthan have their house encumbered by 400 new peers, the Lords gave a\r\nreluctant consent to the measure that virtually destroyed the\r\nbicameral system in England.\r\n\r\nThis profound constitutional change, that practically makes England a\r\nrepresentative democracy pure and simple, was unaccompanied by any of\r\nthose popular and spectacular demonstrations one naturally expects to\r\nsee on such occasions. The debate in both houses rarely touched the\r\npinnacle of excitement, its fervor was partisan rather than\r\npatriotic.[36]\r\n\r\nIn 1832, when the hereditary peers stood in the way of the Reform\r\nBill, which had passed the Commons by only one majority, the populace\r\nrose _en masse_, surged through the streets of the capital, and\r\nthreatened the King and his Iron Duke,--whose statue now adorns every\r\navailable square in the city,--and made it known that their wishes\r\nmust be respected. To-day the people, secure in the knowledge of their\r\nsupremacy, scarcely notice the efforts of the opposition, in its\r\nattempts to bolster the falling walls of hereditary prerogative in\r\nrepresentative government. So far has England assumed the air of\r\ndemocracy.\r\n\r\nThe third piece of legislation, to which allusion has been made,\r\nindicates the direction that this democracy is taking. It is the\r\nInsurance Bill, also introduced by Lloyd George, and passed in\r\nDecember, 1911. It insures the working population against \"sickness\r\nand breakdown.\" It is planned to follow up the law with insurance\r\nagainst non-employment. The law is of especial interest to Americans,\r\nbecause it adapts the principle of the German system to the\r\nAnglo-Saxon's traditional aversion to state bureaucracy. It commands a\r\ncompulsory contribution from employer and employee, supplemented by\r\nstate grants. These funds are not administered by the state, but by\r\n\"Friendly Societies\" (insurance orders organized by the unions) and\r\nother benevolent organizations of workingmen now in existence. These\r\nare democratic, voluntary organizations. Where no such organizations\r\nexist, the post-office administers the fund.\r\n\r\nThe keynote of this law is the prevention of invalidity. Its details\r\nare largely based upon the reports of the Royal Poor Law\r\nCommissioners, 1905-9. The commission made two voluminous reports;\r\nMrs. Sidney Webb, a member of the commission, prepared the minority\r\nreport.[37]\r\n\r\nThe Labor Party, in all of these measures, voted with the Liberals.\r\nThe Insurance Bill was denounced by the most radical Laborites on the\r\nground that labor was charged with contributing to the fund, and that\r\nthe bill was inadequate. But the majority of the delegation voted for\r\nthe measure.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nEnough has now been said to indicate the changes in economic and\r\nsocial legislation that are being brought about in England by the\r\ncoalition of Socialists and Liberals.[38] The causes for this change\r\ncannot be laid to Socialism alone. Socialism is an effect quite as\r\nmuch as a cause; it is the result of industrial conditions, as well as\r\nthe prompter of changes. The permeation of the working classes with\r\nthe principles of state aid; the spread of discontent; the lure of\r\nbetter days; all deepened and emphasized by the poverty of the Island,\r\nare the sources of this Social Democratic current. This has led,\r\nfirst, to the unification of the several Socialist groups; secondly,\r\nto the coalescing of labor union and Socialist ambitions into the\r\nLabor Party; thirdly, to an effective co-operation between the Labor\r\nParty and the Liberal-Radicals.\r\n\r\nSagacious Socialists saw this trend long ago. In 1888 Sidney Webb\r\nappealed to the Liberals to espouse the cause of labor. He pointed out\r\nthe inevitable, and it has happened.[39]\r\n\r\nTwo questions naturally arise: First, how far will this movement\r\ntoward Social Democracy go? Second, how long will the Labor Party hold\r\ntogether and prompt the action of the Liberals and Radicals in social\r\nlegislation?\r\n\r\nThe first question is not merely conjectural. The Reform Bill now\r\n(1912) prepared by the government will destroy the last vestige of\r\nproperty qualifications for voting. It will destroy plural voting,\r\nwhich now allows a freeholder to vote in every district where he holds\r\nland. In some districts the absentee voters hold the balance of\r\npower.[40] Votes for women are also promised. This increased\r\nelectorate will not be conservative in its convictions. Along with\r\nthis will come the abolishing of the custom that compels candidates to\r\nbear the election expenses; the payment of members of Parliament has\r\nalready begun; the lure of office is no longer a will-o'-the-wisp to\r\nthe poor with ambition.\r\n\r\nThe new Liberalism is, then, devoted first of all to real democracy,\r\nin which the King's prerogatives retain their sickly place. As to the\r\nfunctions of the state, it will \"probably retain its distinction from\r\nSocialism in taking for its chief test of policy the freedom of the\r\nindividual citizen rather than the strength of the state, though the\r\nantagonism of the two standpoints may tend to disappear in the light\r\nof progressive experience.\"[41]\r\n\r\nAs to property, it will probably continue to make unearned increments\r\nand incomes bear the burden of social reform; create a business\r\ndemocracy for running the public utilities, leaving more or less\r\nunhampered the fields of legitimate industrial opportunity. \"Property\r\nis not an absolute right of the individual owner which the state is\r\nbound to maintain at his behest. On the contrary, the state on its\r\nside is justified in examining the rights which he may claim, and\r\ncriticising them; seeing it is by the force of the state and at its\r\nexpense that all such rights are maintained.\"[42] This, the\r\nwell-considered opinion of a well-known scholar, may be properly taken\r\nas the gauge of present-day English Radical sentiment on the\r\ninviolability of property rights.\r\n\r\nAs to the second question: How long will the coalition hang together?\r\nthe Socialists are now (1912) showing signs of restiveness. The old\r\nquestion, that has rent all Socialists in all countries, and always\r\nwill, because Socialism is a wide-spreading and vague generalization,\r\nhas arisen among these practical Englishmen. In the convention of the\r\nI.L.P., 1910, there was a prolonged discussion on the policy of the\r\nparty in its relation to other parties. \"The Labor Party should stand\r\nfor labor, not for Liberalism,\" was the complaint. Keir Hardie\r\nsuggested that they were not in Parliament to keep governments in\r\noffice or to turn them out, but \"to organize the working classes into\r\na great independent political power, to fight for the coming of\r\nSocialism.\"[43] A resolution objecting to members of the party\r\n\"appearing on platforms alongside Liberal and Tory capitalists and\r\nlandlords,\" was defeated by a large majority.[44]\r\n\r\nIn the House of Commons clashes are not infrequent between the\r\nLaborites and the Liberals. Annually the labor members move an\r\namendment to the Address of the Crown, asking for a bill \"to establish\r\nthe right to work by placing upon the state the responsibility of\r\ndirectly providing employment or maintenance for the genuinely\r\nunemployed.\"[45] John Burns opposed their amendment in 1911, in a\r\nbrilliant and vehement speech, not so much because the government was\r\nopposed to the principle, but for the political reason that the\r\ngovernment was not ready to bring in a bill of its own, which should\r\nbe a part of its comprehensive system of social reform.[46]\r\n\r\nThe great strike of transportation workers, in the summer of 1911,\r\nwidened the breach between Laborites and Liberals, and between the\r\nextreme and moderate Socialists. This strike spread from the dockers\r\nof Liverpool to London, from the dockers to the railway workers, and\r\nthen to the teamsters and drivers of the larger cities, until a\r\ngeneral tie-up of transportation was threatened. It came very near\r\nbeing a model general strike. Its violence was met with a call for the\r\ntroops. The labor members in Parliament protested earnestly against\r\nthe use of soldiers. But the government was prompt and firm in its\r\nsuppression of disorder. A bitter debate took place between the\r\ngovernment and the labor leaders.[47]\r\n\r\nHow much of this give and take must be attributed to the play of\r\npolitics, it is impossible to declare. But this great strike clearly\r\nrevealed the difference between violent Socialism and moderate\r\nradicalism. The one is willing to effect revolutions through law and\r\norder, the other to effect them through violence and disruption.\r\n\r\nThe moderate Socialists seem willing to take a middle course between\r\nthese extremes. The following quotation from a speech delivered by\r\nRamsay MacDonald, leader of the Labor Party, at a convention of the\r\nI.L.P., clearly illustrates the moderate view:\r\n\r\n\"We can cut off kings' heads after a few battles, we can change a\r\nmonarchy into a republic, we can deprive people of their titles, and\r\nwe can make similar superficial alterations by force; but nobody who\r\nunderstands the power of habit and of custom in human conduct, who\r\nappreciates the fact that by far and away the greater amount of an\r\naction is begun, controlled, and specified by the system of social\r\ninterrelationship in which we live, move, and have our being; and\r\nstill more, nobody who understands the delicate and intricate\r\ncomplexity of production and exchange which keeps modern society\r\ngoing, will dream for a single moment of changing it by any act of\r\nviolence. As soon as that act is committed, every vital force in\r\nsociety will tend to re-establish the relationship which we have been\r\ntrying to end, and what is more, these vital forces will conquer us in\r\nthe form of a violent reaction, a counter revolution. When we cut off\r\na newt's tail, a newt's tail will grow on again.\r\n\r\n\"I want the\" I.L.P.'s action \"to be determined by our numbers, our\r\nrelative strength, the state of public opinion, the character of the\r\nquestion before the country. I appeal to it that it take into account\r\nall the facts and circumstances, and not, for the sake of satisfying\r\nits soul and sentiment, go gaily on, listening to the enunciation of\r\npolicies and cheering phrases which obviously do not take into account\r\nsome of the most important and at the same time most difficult\r\nproblems which representation in Parliament presents to it.\"[48] In\r\nanother place MacDonald has detailed the steps in the progress of\r\nParliamentary Socialism. He begins with \"palliatives,\" such as factory\r\ninspection, old-age pensions, feeding of school children; next, the\r\nstate engages in constructive legislation, \"municipalization and\r\nnationalization in every shape and form, from milk supplies to\r\ntelephones,\" and finally insists on the taxing of unearned increment\r\nand a general redistribution of the burdens of the state.[49]\r\n\r\nNot all the members of the I.L.P. are agreed upon this moderate\r\nstatement. Keir Hardie and his immediate followers still cling to the\r\n\"larger hope\" of a socialized society, to which commonplace\r\nlegislation is only a crude preliminary.\r\n\r\nBernard Shaw has confessed the orthodoxy of the new Social Democracy.\r\n\"Nobody now considers Socialism as a destructive insurrection ending,\r\nif successful, in millennial absurdities,\" and of the budget he said:\r\n\"If not a surrender of the capitalist citadel, it is at all events\r\nletting down the drawbridge.\"[50] The public utterances of the Radical\r\nleaders are often less restrained than those of the Socialists,[51] so\r\nthat it becomes increasingly difficult to tell the difference.\r\n\r\nProfessor Hobhouse, in his analysis of the difference between\r\nLiberal-Radicalism and Socialism, says: \"I venture to conclude that\r\nthe differences between a true and consistent public-spirited\r\nliberalism and a rational collectivism, ought, with a genuine effort\r\nat mutual understanding, to disappear. The two parties are called on\r\nto make common cause against the growing power of wealth, which, by\r\nits control of the press and of the means of political organization,\r\nis more and more a menace to the healthy working of popular\r\ngovernment.\"[52]\r\n\r\nAnd Brougham Villiers stated, a year before the Liberals gained\r\ncontrol of the government, that the hope of the country lay in an\r\n\"alliance, won by persistent, intelligent helpfulness on the part of\r\nthe Liberals, with the alienated artisans, for the betterment of the\r\nconditions of the poorest, so as to give at once hope and life and\r\nbetter leisure for thought.\"[53]\r\n\r\nSo we see Socialism and Liberalism united in accomplishing changes in\r\nlegislation and ancient institutions--changes that are revolutionary\r\nin character and will be far-reaching in results. It is not the red\r\nrevolutionary Socialism of Marx; it is the practical British Socialism\r\nof amelioration. \"This practical, constitutional, evolutionary\r\nSocialism,\" a chronicler of the Fabians calls it.[54] It would have to\r\nbe practical to appeal to the British voter, constitutional to lure\r\nthe British statesman, and evolutionary to satisfy the British\r\nphilosopher.\r\n\r\nIn the troublous days of 1888-90 there were a great many young\r\nSocialists who believed the social revolution was waiting around the\r\nnext corner and would soon sweep over London in gory reality. Many of\r\nthese young men are sober Fabians now, or staid Conservatives or\r\nLiberals. To-day they think they were mistaken. They were not. There\r\nwas a revolution around the next corner. It has already captured the\r\nhigh places. Society, government, is rapidly encroaching upon private\r\nproperty through the powers of taxation, of police supervision, and\r\nall manner of constitutional instrumentalities. Ownership, even in\r\nland, is now only an incident, the rights of the community are in the\r\nascendant. Democracy has conquered hereditary privilege. And the\r\nrevolution is still advancing. England is showing the world that \"The\r\nway to make Socialism safe is to make democracy real.\"[55]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] See _supra_, p. 51.\r\n\r\n[2] See CHIOZZA MONEY, _Riches and Poverty_, first page, edition 1911.\r\n\r\n[3] _Op. cit._, p. 337.\r\n\r\n[4] _Op. cit._, pp. 337-8.\r\n\r\n[5] See V.

His pamphlet, _Socialism_, is a real contribution to the\r\nliterature on the Church and its relation to labor. The present\r\nattitude of the Union may be gleaned from the following quotation\r\ntaken from the letter written by Dr. Gore, Bishop of Birmingham, to\r\nhis diocese, on the occasion of his transfer to the bishopric of\r\nOxford. The letter was written during the railway and dockers' strike,\r\nin September, 1911: \"There is a profound sense of unrest and\r\ndissatisfaction among workers recently. I cannot but believe that this\r\nprofound discontent is justified, though some particular exhibitions\r\nof it are not. As Christians we are not justified in tolerating the\r\nconditions of life and labor under which the vast mass of our\r\npopulation is living. We have no right to say that these conditions\r\nare not remediable. Preventable lack of equipment for life among\r\nyoung, and later the insecurity of employment and inadequacy of\r\nremuneration, and consequent destitution and semi-destitution among so\r\nmany people, ought to inspire in all Christians a determination to\r\nreform our industrial system.\"\r\n\r\n[13] From _Statement of Principles of the League_.\r\n\r\n[14] Even at this time the conservatism of the unions was hard to\r\nbreak. The vote to take this step was 546,000 to 434,000 in favor of\r\nappointing the committee.\r\n\r\n[15] Election expenses are borne by the candidates, not by the state.\r\nThey frequently are over $3,000, and it obviously is impossible for a\r\nworkingman to conduct such a campaign at his own expense.\r\n\r\n[16] Proceedings of Labor Party, Annual Congress, 1907.\r\n\r\n[17] See _Socialists in Great Britain_, a compilation published by the\r\nLondon _Times_, p. 24.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the membership of the Labor Party since its\r\nformation in 1900, from the annual report of the party executive,\r\n1911:\r\n\r\n                            Trades Councils\r\n                            and Local Labor\r\n            Trade Unions        Parties         Socialist Societies\r\n           No.  Membership        No.        No.  Membership    Total\r\n  1900-1    41     353,070           7         3    22,861     375,931\r\n  1901-2    65     455,450          21         2    13,861     469,311\r\n  1902-3   127     847,315          49         2    13,835     861,150\r\n  1903-4   165     956,025          76         2    13,775     969,800\r\n  1904-5   158     885,270          73         2    14,730     900,000\r\n  1905-6   158     904,496          73         2    16,784     921,280\r\n  1906-7   176     975,182          83         2    20,885     998,338{1}\r\n  1907     181   1,049,673          92         2    22,267   1,072,413{2}\r\n  1908     176   1,127,035         133         2    27,465   1,158,565{3}\r\n  1909     172   1,450,648         155         2    30,982   1,486,308{4}\r\n  1910     137   1,306,473         125         2    31,377   1,342,610{5}\r\n\r\n{1} This total includes 2,271 Co-operators. {2} Includes 472\r\nCo-operators. {3} Includes 565 Co-operators, and 3,500 members of the\r\nWomen's Labor League. {4} Includes 678 Co-operators, and 4,000 members\r\nof the Women's Labor League. {5} Includes 760 Co-operators, and 4,000\r\nmembers of the Women's Labor League.\r\n\r\nThe decrease in membership during the last year is ascribed to the\r\nOsborne judgment.\r\n\r\n[18] HAROLD COX, _Socialism in the House of Commons_, p. 1.\r\n\r\n[19] See J.A.

The more restless Socialists are inclined to call him a\r\nLiberal because responsibility has taught him caution. But he still\r\npersists that he is a Socialist. He is a Fabian, and boasts of the\r\nthree times that he was imprisoned for participating in labor\r\nagitations. About twenty years before his elevation he said in the Old\r\nBailey, where he had been arraigned for \"sedition and conspiracy\" in\r\nconducting a strike: \"I may tell you, my lord, that I went to work in\r\na factory at the early age of ten years and toiled there until five\r\nmonths ago, when I left my workshop to stand as Parliamentary\r\ncandidate for the western division of Nottingham.\"\r\n\r\nIt must be kept in mind that many of the Conservatives are committed\r\nto social legislation.

The\r\ndiscipline of the Labor Party was unable to keep half a dozen of its\r\nablest debaters from fighting the Insurance Bill. The reversion of the\r\nradical Socialist element to the I.L.P. is by some observers\r\nconsidered not unlikely.

HOBSON, _The Crisis of Liberalism_, p. 156.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now concluded our survey of the political activities of\r\nSocialism in the four countries that present the most characteristic\r\nfeatures of this movement of the working classes. It is peculiarly\r\ndifficult to draw general conclusions from the study of a movement so\r\nprotean. Democracy is young; Socialism is in its early infancy.\r\n\r\nIs there a rational trend in Socialism? Or is it only a passing whim\r\nof the masses? Is it a crude theory, an earnest protest, a powerful\r\npropaganda? Or is it a current of human conviction so strong, so\r\ndeep-flowing that it will be resistless?\r\n\r\nIt is futile to deny the power of the Socialist movement. The greatest\r\nproof of its virility is its ability to break away from Marxian dogma\r\nand from the fantasies of the utopists, and acknowledge mundane ways\r\nand means. In spite of this earthiness, it still has its fanciful\r\nabstractions. Some of its prophets are still glibly proclaiming a new\r\norder,--as if society were artificial, like a house, and could be torn\r\ndown piecemeal or by dynamite, and then rebuilt to suit the vagaries\r\nof a new owner.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a portion of the Socialists are learning that\r\nsociety is a living thing that can be shaped only by training, like\r\nthe mind of a child. Socialism, as a whole, is metamorphosing. Some of\r\nits vicious eccentricities, like the ravings against religion and the\r\nespousal of free love, have already vanished. It is learning that\r\ninstitutions are the product of ages, not of movements, and cannot be\r\nchanged at the fancy of every new and disgruntled social prophet.\r\n\r\nThe best school for Socialism has been the school of parliamentary\r\nactivity. Here the hot-blooded protesters become sober artisans of\r\nstatecraft. We have seen how the early utopian ideas, with their\r\nedenesque theory of the guilelessness of man, were abruptly exchanged\r\nfor the theory of violence, based on the materialistic conception of\r\nthe universe and of man. Neither the soft humanities of the utopists\r\nnor the blood and thunder of revolution overturned the existing state.\r\nBut when the workingmen appeared in parliaments, then things began to\r\nchange.\r\n\r\nIn every country where the Socialists have entered parliament, they\r\nappeared suddenly, in considerable numbers. So in France, Germany,\r\nEngland, Belgium, Austria. And they always produced a flutter, often a\r\nscare, among the conservatives. They were an untried force. Their\r\npreachings of violence and their antagonism to property made them an\r\nunknown quantity, to be feared, and not to be lightly handled--a bomb\r\nof political dynamite that might explode any moment and scatter the\r\nproduct of ages into fragments!\r\n\r\nBut no explosion came. And one more example of the persistence of\r\nhuman nature was added to the long annals of history.\r\n\r\nIn every country the parliamentary experience has been the same: the\r\nliberal and radical element, attracted by the legislative demands of\r\nthe labor party, coalesced, for specific issues, with the Socialists,\r\nand a new era of economic and social legislation was ushered in. Even\r\nin Germany, with its unmodern conditions in government, all the powers\r\nof feudal autocracy failed to crush the rising forces of the new\r\npolitical consciousness.\r\n\r\nIn France and England we have seen Socialists take their places in the\r\ncabinet, to the chagrin of that portion of the Socialists who still\r\nregard social classes as natural enemies, and consider social\r\nco-operation among all the elements of society impossible.\r\n\r\nIn brief, Socialism has entered politics and has become mundane. You\r\nneed a microscope to tell a Socialist from a Socialist-Radical in\r\nFrance, and a Laborite from a Radical-Liberal in England. Briand and\r\nMillerand may be voted out of the Socialist Party, and John Burns may\r\nbe spurned by the I.L.P. But these men are teaching a double lesson:\r\nfirst, that there are no new ways to human betterment; second, that\r\nthe old way is worth traveling, because it does lead to happier and\r\neasier conditions of toil. Socialists the world over will soon be\r\ncompelled to realize that the political force which shrinks from the\r\nresponsibility of daily political drudgery will never be a permanent\r\nfactor in life. A political party that is afraid to assume the\r\nobligations of government for fear that it will lose its ideal, is too\r\nfragile for this world.\r\n\r\nThe Socialist Party wherever it exists is a labor party, with a labor\r\nprogram that is based on conditions which need to be remedied. Their\r\npractical demands as a rule are of such a nature that all of society\r\nwould benefit by their enactment into law. The mystery has all gone\r\nout of the movement. It is not necromancy, it is plain parliamentary\r\nhumdrum which you see. The threatened witchery is all words; the\r\ndoing is intensely human, of the earth earthy.\r\n\r\nThe Socialist movement tends toward the latest phase of democracy,\r\nwhich is social democracy; the democracy that has ceased to toy with\r\nLiberty, Equality, and Fraternity, and the other tinsel abstractions\r\nof the bourgeois revolutions; the democracy that sees poverty and\r\nsuffering increase as wealth and ease increase. It is the democracy of\r\nthe human heart, that cares for the babe in the slums, the lad in the\r\nfactory, the mother at the cradle, and the father in his old age.\r\nAgainst all these helpless ones society has sinned. And it is to a\r\nuniversal, sincere, social penance that the new democracy calls the\r\nrich, the powerful, and the comfortable.\r\n\r\nSocialism is merging rapidly into this new democracy. In doing so it\r\nis abandoning its two great illusions. The first illusion is that the\r\ninterests of the worker are somehow different from the interests of\r\nthe rest of the community. Class war has been a resonant battle-cry,\r\nand has served its purpose. It is folly for any class to magnify its\r\nneeds above those of the rest of society. Civilization and culture\r\nembrace the artisan and the artist, the poor and the powerful. Any\r\nclass interest that clashes with the welfare of society as a whole\r\ncannot survive. Socialism is abandoning the tyranny of class war, is\r\nbeing mellowed by class co-operation. Socialists are now claiming that\r\ntheir interests are the interests of society. The social complexion of\r\nthe party in the countries of its greatest advancement is an\r\nindication of this. Many of the party leaders are of middle-class\r\norigin. Some of them are rich. You call at their homes and servants\r\nopen the door and receive your card on a silver tray. Multitudes of\r\nlawyers, physicians, journalists, and professors are in the movement.\r\nDr. Frank of Mannheim, the leader of the Badensian Socialists, said to\r\nme that the degree to which Socialism can gain the support of the\r\nintellectual element is the measure of success of the movement. All\r\nthis indicates that Socialism is breaking the bonds of self-limited\r\nclass egoism. The peasant landowner, the small shopkeeper, the\r\nintellectualist, and occasionally a man or two of wealth and high\r\nsocial position are being drawn into this new democracy.\r\n\r\nThe question is now being seriously asked: Can there be a social\r\nco-operation? Must there always be industrial war? Von Vollmar,\r\nMillerand, Vandervelde, MacDonald proclaim the possibility of rational\r\nco-operation. MacDonald says: \"The defense for democracy which is far\r\nand away the weightiest is that progress must spring, not from the\r\ngenerosity or enlightenment of a class, but from the common\r\nintelligence.\" \"It must be pointed out that the labor legislation now\r\nbeing asked for is very much more than a sequel to that passed under\r\nthe influence of Lord Shaftesbury. This differs from that as the\r\nworking of the moral conscience differs from the motives of the first\r\nbrute man who shaped his conduct under a contract of mutual defense\r\nwith a friendly neighbor. To use the arm of the law to abolish crying\r\nevils, to put an end to an ever-present injustice, is one thing; to\r\nuse that arm to promote justice and to keep open the road to moral\r\nadvancement, to bring down from their throne in the ideal into a place\r\nin the world certain conceptions of distributive justice, is quite\r\nanother thing. And yet this latter is now being attempted, and was\r\ncertain to be attempted as soon as democracy came into power. When\r\nsociety is enfranchised, the social question becomes the political\r\nquestion.\"[1]\r\n\r\n\"The state is not the interest of a class, but the organ of\r\nsociety.\"[2] There can be no broader foundation for political action\r\nthan this. All progress springs from the \"common intelligence\" to\r\nwhich every one contributes his quota.\r\n\r\nThe second great illusion of Socialism is the social revolution. No\r\none except a few extremists any longer thinks of the revolution by\r\nblood. Engels, the friend of Marx, shows that everywhere violence is\r\ngiving way to political methods. \"Even in the Romance countries we see\r\nthe old tactics revised. Everywhere the German example of using the\r\nballots is being followed. Even in France the Socialists see more and\r\nmore that no lasting victory is to be theirs unless they win\r\nbeforehand the great masses of the people. The slow work of propaganda\r\nand parliamentary activity is here also recognized as the next step in\r\nparty development.\"[3] Engels shows how Socialists have entered the\r\nparliaments of Belgium, Italy, Denmark, Bulgaria, Roumania, as well as\r\nthe parliaments of the great powers. And he indicates that the\r\nrevolution of the Socialist must come as a revolution by\r\nmajorities--which is democracy.\r\n\r\nEngels still believed that violence would follow the accession of\r\ndemocratic power. If he had lived another decade he would have\r\ndiscarded this last remnant of the theory of violence. In Germany the\r\nbourgeois are more frightened over the legal than over the illegal\r\nacts of the Socialist. They fear the results of elections more than\r\nrebellion. Violence they can suppress with a bayonet, but laws--they\r\nmust be obeyed.\r\n\r\nThis is true in every country. The power of the ballot is infinitely\r\ngreater than the power of the bullet, provided it is followed up with\r\ncommon sense and energy.\r\n\r\nThe theory of violence, then, has almost disappeared. The Syndicalist,\r\nin his reversion to anarchy, attempts to revive the forsaken theory.\r\nHe does this by a general strike. But the general strike is not to be\r\nconfused with the social revolution. The general strike, wherever it\r\nhas been tried as an economic forcing valve, has failed. But whenever\r\nit has been used as a political uprising, demanding political rights,\r\nit has been more or less successful. In Belgium we have seen how it\r\nbrought results. In Sweden a few years ago there was a general strike\r\nthat not only shut every factory, but stopped the street cars and all\r\ntransportation lines, closed the gas-works, and even the newspapers\r\nwere suspended. It was a powerful political protest, but the number of\r\nstriking workmen did not equal the non-strikers.\r\n\r\nIn Italy in 1904 a general strike was called to protest against the\r\narbitrary attitude of the government toward the labor movement. In\r\nsome of the cities all work ceased, even the gondoliers of Venice\r\njoined the strikers. In Russia in 1904-5 the transportation lines and\r\npost and telegraph lines were tied up while the workingmen\r\ndemonstrated for their political liberty.\r\n\r\nThe violence of Socialism to-day is political; the violence of trade\r\nunionism is economic. As the democratic consciousness spreads, there\r\nmay be such a coalescing of interests that violence will cease. But a\r\nhuman society without warfare and contention is still a tax upon the\r\nimagination. Strikes are increasing in number and bitterness and all\r\nthe arbitrations and devices of democracies seem helpless in the\r\nturmoil of economic strife.\r\n\r\nI am not unmindful that behind all this parliamentary activity there\r\nis the dim background of hope in the hearts of many Socialists that\r\nsomehow the wage system will vanish, that competition will cease, that\r\nthe primary activities of production and distribution will be assumed\r\nby society, and that economic extremes will become impossible. In a\r\npeople of fitful temper and ebullient spirit the doctrine of\r\noverturning remains a constant menace. Socialism in Spain and Italy\r\nwears a scarlet coat, in Germany a drab, and in England a black. The\r\ndanger to civilization lurks, not in the survival of the doctrines of\r\nthe older Socialism, but in the temper of the people who espouse them.\r\n\r\nThe Socialist movement has accomplished three notable things. First,\r\nit has spread democracy. The bourgeois revolutions established\r\ndemocracy; Socialism extends it. We have seen how in Belgium it\r\ncompelled the governing powers to give labor the ballot; how in\r\nGermany, hard set and dogmatic, it is shaping events that will surely\r\nlead to ministerial responsibility and to universal suffrage; and how\r\nin England it is resulting in universal manhood suffrage and probably\r\n\"votes for women.\" Socialism is spreading the obligations of\r\ngovernment upon all shoulders. It is not, however, democratizing the\r\nmachinery of administration. In France the centralized autocracy of\r\nNapoleon's empire remains almost untouched. In England the ancient\r\ntraditions of administration are slow to change. In Germany the civil\r\nservice will be the last barrier to give way.\r\n\r\nSecondly, Socialism has forced the labor question upon the lawmakers.\r\nThis is a great achievement. The neglected and forgotten portions of\r\nthe human family are now the objects of state solicitude. The record\r\nof this revolution is written in the statute books. Turn the leaves of\r\nthe table of contents of a modern parliamentary journal, and compare\r\nit with the same work of thirty years ago. Almost the entire time is\r\nnow taken up with questions that may be called humanitarian rather\r\nthan financial or political. Grave ministers of state make long\r\nspeeches on the death-rate of babies in the cities, on the cost of\r\nliving in factory towns, on the causes of that most heartbreaking of\r\nmodern woes, non-employment. Budgets are now concerned with the\r\nfeeding of school children as well as the building of warships, and\r\nwith the training of boys as well as the drilling of soldiers.\r\n\r\nNowhere has this radical change taken place without a labor party. The\r\nlaboring man forced the issue. He bent kings and cabinets and\r\nparliaments to his demands. The time was ripe, society had reached\r\nthat stage of its development when it was ready to take up these\r\nquestions. But it did not do so of its own free will. When labor\r\nparties sprang like magic into puissance, a decade ago, the social\r\nconscience was ready to hear their plea. Bismarck foresaw their\r\ndemands. But he was too obsessed of feudalism to realize their\r\nmotives. Therefore his state socialism failed to silence the\r\nSocialists. The workman had his heart in the cause, not merely his\r\ntongue.\r\n\r\nAnd the third great achievement is the natural result of the other\r\ntwo. When democracy is potent enough to force its demands on\r\nparliament, then the power of the state is ready to fulfil its\r\ndemands. So we find in every country where Social Democracy has gained\r\na foothold a constant increase of the functions of the state. What\r\nshall the state do? That is now the great question. One hundred years\r\nago it was, What sort of a state shall we have? That is answered: a\r\ndemocratic state; at least, a state democratic in spirit. The state is\r\nno longer merely judge, soldier, lawmaker, and governor. It is\r\nphysician, forester, bookkeeper, schoolmaster, undertaker, and a\r\nthousand other things. Society has grown complex, and the state, which\r\nis only another name for society, has developed a surprising\r\nprecocity.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that in England especially the trend of legislation is to\r\ndeprive the individual, one by one, of those prerogatives which gave\r\nhim dominion over property. A man owning land in the city of London,\r\nfor instance, has not the liberty to build as he likes or what he\r\nlikes. He must build as the state permits him, and the exactions are\r\nmanifold. He can be compelled to build a certain distance from the\r\nstreet,--that is, the city demands a strip of his land for common use.\r\nHe can build only a certain height,--the community wants the sunlight.\r\nIf his older buildings are dilapidated, the city tears them down. If\r\nthe streets through his allotment are too narrow, the city widens\r\nthem. In short, he may have title in fee simple, but the community has\r\na title superior. Even his income from this parcel of land is not all\r\nhis own. The state now takes a goodly slice in taxes. If he is\r\ninclined to resent this, and does not improve his property, the state\r\ntaxes him on the unearned increment, and if he refuses to submit to\r\nthis \"socialism,\" the constable seizes the whole parcel, and he can\r\nhave what is left after the community has satisfied its demands.\r\n\r\nThe taxes that he pays are distributed over a vast variety of\r\nactivities. They go to feed school children, to pension aged workmen,\r\nto send inspectors into the factories, to keep up hospitals, as well\r\nas to light and pave the streets and pay policemen. Other taxes that\r\nhe pays on other forms of property go to the improvement of\r\nagriculture, to the payment of boards of arbitration, and so on. In\r\nshort, ownership is becoming more and more only an incident; it is not\r\nmerely a badge of ease, but a symbol of social responsibility.\r\n\r\nThe burden of the law is shifting from property to persons, from\r\nprotecting things to protecting humanity. This change from the Roman\r\nlaw is almost revolutionary. Even Blackstone, our halfway-mark in the\r\nevolution of the common law, is busy with postulates protecting\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nWhere is this encroachment of the state on private \"rights\" going to\r\nend? There are some things which the state (society) can do better\r\nthan the individual; like the marshaling of an army or conducting a\r\npost-office, and things that are done to counteract the selfishness of\r\nindividuals, like factory inspection. But there are other things which\r\nsociety cannot do; things that depend on individual effort, like art,\r\nliterature, and invention. The two fields of state and individual\r\nactivity merge into each other. Each nation marks its own\r\ndistinctions. But this is certain: _in a democracy the state will do\r\nthe things which the people want it to do_. And in a Social Democracy\r\nthese things are numerous.\r\n\r\nSocial Democracy strikes a balance between individual duty and\r\ncollective energy. It brings the power of government (collective\r\npower), not to the few who are rich, therefore ignoring oligarchy; nor\r\nto the few who are clever, thereby ignoring tyranny; nor to the few\r\nwho are well-born, thus discarding aristocracy; but it brings all the\r\npower of the government to all the people. It attempts to coalesce the\r\ncleverness of the tyrant, the experience of the aristocrat, the wealth\r\nof the industrial nabob, and the aggregate momentum of the mass, into\r\na humanitarian power. It attempts to use the gifts of all for the\r\nbenefit of all.\r\n\r\nSocial Democracy is the resultant of two forces meeting from opposite\r\ndirections: the forces of industrialism, and Socialism, of\r\ncollectivism and individualism. No one can draw the exact direction of\r\nthis resultant. It attempts to avoid the tyranny and selfishness of\r\nthe few, and the tyranny and greed of the many.\r\n\r\nOur study of the operation of governments under the sway of Social\r\nDemocracy has shown the sort of legislation that is demanded. It is\r\nnot necessary to repeat here the details of these laws. But it is\r\nnecessary to bear in mind that there are two industrial questions\r\nwhich have absolutely refused to bend to the power of government: the\r\nquestion of the length of the workday and the question of wages. The\r\nvast majority of strikes are due to differences over these two\r\nquestions. The eight-hour day and the minimum wage have been\r\nsuccessful only in a limited government service.[4] Nor has any\r\nmachinery set up by governments to avoid industrial collisions between\r\nworkmen and employers been successful in avoiding differences over\r\nhours and wages. The elaborate system of Germany, for instance, is\r\nnothing more than the good will of the state offered to the warring\r\nindustrial elements in the interests of peace. The questions of hours\r\nand wages are so fundamental that they embrace the right of private\r\nproperty. Any power that divests an individual of the right to dispose\r\nof his time or substance by contract virtually deprives him of the\r\nright of ownership.\r\n\r\nThe limits to the possibilities of Social Democracy are the limits of\r\nprivate ownership. This brings us at once to the verge of the eternal\r\nquestion of government--the finding of a just ratio between individual\r\nand collective responsibility: a ratio that varies with varying\r\nnationalities, and that will vary with the passing years. Each\r\ngeneration in every land will have to fix the limitations for itself.\r\n\r\nThe new Social Democracy has acquired certain characteristics which\r\nwill help us in determining the trend of its movements. In the first\r\nplace it is an educated Social Democracy. The taunt of ignorance\r\napplied to the old Socialism of passion cannot be applied to the new\r\nSocialism of practice. The nations of Europe no longer debate the\r\nsuitability of universal education. That question happily was settled\r\nfor the United States with the landing of the Pilgrims. It took one\r\nhundred years for Europe to understand the Ordinance of 1787, that\r\n\"schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged.\" Not\r\nall of the European nations have touched the heights of this ideal,\r\nbut Social Democracy is struggling towards it, and schools, more or\r\nless efficient, are open to the workmen's children. This education is\r\nextended to adults by the press and by self-imposed studies. The\r\neagerness with which men and women flock to lectures and night classes\r\nis a great omen. In Paris the _Ecole Socialiste_ and _Universite\r\nPopulaire_, in Germany and Belgium the night classes in the labor\r\nunion clubhouses, the debates and the lecture courses, are evidences\r\nof intellectual eagerness.\r\n\r\nIn the second place it is a drilled democracy. It is organized into\r\nvast co-operative societies and trade unions. Here it learns the\r\nlesson of constant watchfulness over details. This training in the\r\ninfinite little things of business is a good sedative. Socialists\r\nbargain and sell and learn the lessons of competition; do banking and\r\nlearn discount; engage in manufacture and learn the problem of the\r\nemployer.\r\n\r\nThey are, moreover, drilled in parliaments, in city and county\r\ncouncils, in communal offices. They learn the advantages of give and\r\ntake, are skilled in compromise, and feel the friction of opposition.\r\n\r\nAll this has wrought a wonderful change in Socialism. To a Belgian\r\nco-operativist running a butcher-shop, the eight-hour day is a\r\npractical problem; and to a Bavarian member of a city council the\r\nquestion of opening communal dwellings ceases to be only a subject for\r\ndebate. Nothing has brought these people to earth so suddenly as the\r\ninfusion of earthly experience into their blood. And this transfusion\r\nhas given them life. It has rid them of their many adjectives and\r\ngiven them a few verbs. It has robbed them in large measure of their\r\nmob spirit.[5] Every year the arbitrary governments of Europe are\r\nfinding police coercion more and more unnecessary. The Socialist crowd\r\nis growing orderly, is achieving that self-control which alone\r\nentitles a people to self-government.\r\n\r\nIt is not unnatural that this movement has made leaders. Of these,\r\nHerr August Bebel is the most remarkable example. This woodturner,\r\nturned party autocrat and statesman, is a never-ending wonder to the\r\nGerman aristocracy. His speeches are read as eagerly as those of the\r\nChancellor, and his opinions are quoted as widely as the Kaiser's.\r\nWhen in 1911 he made his great speech on the Morocco Question in the\r\nSocial Democratic Convention, it was reported by the column in all of\r\nthe great Continental and English dailies. Bebel is an example of what\r\nthe open door of opportunity will do, and he had to force the door\r\nhimself. A few years ago, in a moment of reminiscent confidence, he\r\nconfessed that he used to cherish as an ideal the time when he could,\r\nfor once, have all the bread and butter he could eat. In America we\r\nare accustomed to this rising into power of obscure and untried men.\r\nBut in Europe it is rare. European Social Democracy is an expression\r\nof the desire on the part of the people for the open highways of\r\nopportunity.\r\n\r\nIn the third place, Social Democracy is self-conscious. I have not\r\nused the word class-conscious, because it is more than the\r\nconsciousness of an economic group. History is replete with instances\r\nthat reveal the irresistible power generated by mass consciousness.\r\nThis is the psychology of nationalism. The dynamo that generates the\r\nmysterious voltage of patriotism, of tribal loyalty, is the heart.\r\nSocialism has replaced tribal and national ideals and welded its\r\ndevotees into a self-conscious international unity. Whatever danger\r\nthere may be in Socialism is the danger of the zealot. The ideal may\r\nbe impracticable and discarded, but the devotion to it may be blind\r\nand destructive.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, Socialist leaders and writers maintain that this drawing\r\ntogether of Socialism and democracy is only transitory, and that\r\nbeyond this lies the promised land of social production. Jaures has\r\nexplained this clearly: \"Democracy, under the impetus given it by\r\norganized labor, is evolving irresistibly toward Socialism, and\r\nSocialism toward a form of property which will deliver man from his\r\nexploitation by man, and bring to an end the regime of class\r\ngovernment. The Radicals flatter themselves that they can put a stop\r\nto this movement by promising the working classes some reforms, and by\r\nproclaiming themselves the guardians of private property. They hope to\r\nhold a large part of the proletariat in check by a few reforming laws\r\nexpressing a sentiment of social solidarity, and by their policy of\r\ndefending private property to rouse the conservative forces, the petty\r\nbourgeoisie, the middle classes, and the small peasant proprietors to\r\noppose Socialism.\"[6]\r\n\r\nSo we see that in spite of their experiences Socialists still draw a\r\nclear distinction between their Socialism and democracy. The Socialist\r\nis willing to ignore the experiences of the past twenty years in his\r\necstasy of vision. He claims that whatever has been done is mere\r\nreform. He affects to belittle it, the Marxian scorns it. To the\r\nSocialist, democracy is only the halfway house on the road to the\r\neconomic paradise. He has his gaze fixed on the New Jerusalem of\r\n\"co-operative production\" and \"distributive justice.\" Whether this New\r\nCity, with its streets paved with the gold of altruism and its gates\r\ngarnished with the pearls of good will and benevolence, will be\r\nbrought from the fleecy clouds of ecstatic imagination to our sordid\r\nearth remains a question of speculation to that vast body of sincere\r\nand practical citizens who have not scaled the heights of the\r\nSocialistic Patmos.\r\n\r\nEuropean Socialism has been transplanted to America. But its growth\r\nuntil quite recently has been very slow, and confined largely to\r\nimmigrants. There is no political spur to hasten the movement. Here\r\ndemocracy has been achieved. The universal ballot, free speech, free\r\npress, free association are accomplished. Many of the economic\r\npolicies espoused by the Social Democratic parties of Europe are\r\nwritten into the platforms of our political parties. There will be no\r\nindependent labor party of any strength until the old parties have\r\naroused the distrust of the great body of laboring men, and until the\r\nlabor unions cut loose from their traditional aloofness and enter\r\npolitics. How socialistic such a party will be must depend upon the\r\ncircumstances attending its organization. The two third-party\r\nmovements which have flourished since the Civil War, the Greenback\r\nmovement of the '70's and the Populist movement of the '90's, were\r\nvirtually \"class\" parties, restricted to the agricultural population\r\nof the Middle and Far West; and both of them feared Socialism as much\r\nas they hated capitalism. Neither of these parties outlived a decade.\r\nEconomic prosperity abruptly ended both.[7]\r\n\r\nThe stress of political exclusiveness and the harsh hand of government\r\nwill not produce a reactionary movement among the workingmen of\r\nAmerica. But economic circumstances may do so. We are still a young\r\ncountry full of the hope of youth. The ranks of every walk of life are\r\nfilled with those who have worked their way to success from humble\r\norigin. Most of our famous men struggled with poverty in their youth.\r\nTheir lives are constantly held up to the children of the nation as\r\nexamples of American pluck, enterprise, and opportunity. A nation that\r\nlures its clerks toward proprietorship and its artisans toward\r\nindependence offers barren soil for the doctrines of discontent. We\r\nhave no stereotyped poverty in the European sense. Our farmers own\r\ntheir acreage, and many of the urban poor are able to buy a cottage in\r\nthe outskirts of the city.\r\n\r\nBut there are signs that these conditions are undergoing profound\r\nchanges. Unlimited competition has led to limitless consolidation of\r\nindustries, and the financial destinies of the Republic repose in the\r\nhands of comparatively few men. So much of the Marxian proposition is\r\nfulfilled, at the moment, in America. This concentrated wealth has not\r\nbeen unmindful of politics. Governmental power and money power are\r\nclosely identified in the public mind. Our cities are overflowing with\r\na new population from the excitable portions of southern Europe, a\r\npopulation that is proletarian in every sense of the word. Panics\r\nfollow one another in rapid succession. The uneasiness of business is\r\nfed by the turmoil of politics. Unrest is everywhere. Labor and\r\nbusiness are engaged in constant struggles that affect all members of\r\nsociety. The cost of living has increased alarmingly in the last ten\r\nyears. We are becoming rapidly a manufacturing nation; the balance of\r\npower is shifting from the farm to the city.[8]\r\n\r\nEuropean Socialists are taking a keen interest in American affairs.\r\nBebel said to me: \"You are getting ready for the appropriation of the\r\ngreat productive enterprises and the railways. Your trusts make the\r\nproblem easy.\" John Burns prophesied that violence and bloodshed alone\r\nwould check us in our mad career for wealth. Jaures asked how long it\r\nwould take before our poverty would be worse than that of Europe. At a\r\ndistance they see us plunging headlong into a Socialist regime.\r\n\r\nProfessor Brentano of Munich knows us better. He said to me,\r\n\"Conservation will be your Socialism.\"[9] If the fundamental\r\nprinciples of conservation can be embodied in constitutional laws,\r\nthen there will be an almost indefinite extension of the power of the\r\nstate over industry. It will embrace mines, forests, irrigated\r\ndeserts; it will extend to the sources of all water supply and water\r\npower; the means of transportation may ultimately be included. So that\r\nwithout radical legal and institutional changes it will be possible\r\nfor many of the sources of our raw materials to be placed under\r\ngovernmental surveillance, leaving the processes of manufacture and\r\nexchange in the hands of private individuals.\r\n\r\nThere are at present many indications that this will be our general\r\nprocess of \"socialization.\" The people appear to want it; and in a\r\ndemocracy the will of the people must prevail.\r\n\r\nBefore we have advanced far along the new road of conservation we will\r\nfind it necessary to reconstruct our whole system of administration.\r\nThe haphazard of politics must be foreign to public business.\r\nEverywhere in Europe, especially in Germany and England, the people,\r\nincluding the Socialists, appear satisfied with the efficiency of\r\ntheir administrative machinery. Who would intrust the running of a\r\nrailroad to our Federal or State governments?\r\n\r\nWe have reached the extreme of rampant _laissez-faire_. Our youthful\r\nvigor and material wealth have kept us buoyant. Politically we will\r\nbecome more radical, economically less individualistic, in the next\r\ncycle of our development. There is no magic that saves a people except\r\nthe magic of opportunity. In a democracy especially it is necessary to\r\nconstantly purge society by free-moving currents of talent and virtue.\r\nThis replenishing stream has its sources in the sturdy, healthy\r\nworkers of the nation. The movement is from the depths upward. It is\r\nthe supreme function of the state to keep these sources unclogged.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] J.

On January 1, 1912, 377 villages, towns, and cities in 36\r\nStates had some Socialist officers. Several important cities have been\r\nunder Socialist rule, notably Milwaukee and Schenectady, where the\r\nSocialists captured the entire city machinery. In 1912 the Socialists\r\nlost control of Milwaukee, although their vote increased 3,000.

These are, of course, too numerous and too\r\nfluctuating in character to be catalogued.

FRANCE\r\n\r\n\r\n1. NOTE ON THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nYves Guyot, the distinguished French publicist, told the writer that\r\nthere was only one compact, disciplined political party in France, the\r\nUnited Socialists. Other than the Socialists, there is no\r\nwell-organized group in the Chamber of Deputies. The Right, Center,\r\nand Left coalesce almost insensibly into each other. Party platforms\r\nand party loyalty are replaced by a political individualism that to an\r\nAmerican politician would seem like political anarchy.\r\n\r\nThe Chamber of Deputies is supreme--the ministry stands or falls upon\r\nits majority's behest. This gives to the deputy a peculiar personal\r\npower. He is only loosely affiliated with his group, is a powerful\r\nfactor in the government of the Republic, and is directly dependent\r\nupon his constituents for his tenure in office. The result is a\r\npersonal, rather then a party, system of politics.\r\n\r\nThis remarkably decentralized system of representative governance is\r\ncounterbalanced by a highly efficient and completely centralized\r\nsystem of administration, which is based on civil service, and\r\noutlives all the mutations of ministries and shifting of deputies. The\r\nministry, naturally, has theoretical control over the administrative\r\nofficials. During the campaign for reorganizing the army and navy, and\r\nthe disestablishment of the Church, under the Radical-Socialist\r\n_bloc_, a few years ago, General Andre, acting for the ministry,\r\nresorted to a comprehensive system of espionage to ferret out the\r\nundesirable officers. Every commune has its official scrutinizer, who\r\nreports the doings of the employees to the government.\r\n\r\nThis, in turn, has created a clientilism. The deputy is needed by the\r\nministry, the deputy needs the votes of his constituency, the local\r\nofficials need the good will of the deputy. The result is a fawning\r\nfavoritism that has taken the place of party servitude as we know it\r\nin America.\r\n\r\nThe Socialists have precipitated a serious problem in this relation of\r\nthe government employee to the state: Can the state employees form a\r\nunion? There are nearly 1,000,000 state employees. This includes not\r\nonly all the functionaries, but all the workmen in the match\r\nfactories, the mint, the national porcelain factory and tobacco\r\nplants, and the navy yards. In 1885 and again in 1902 the Court of\r\nCassation decided that \"the right of forming a union (_syndicat_) is\r\nconfined to those who, whether as employers or as workmen or employed,\r\nare engaged in _industry, agriculture, or commerce_, to the exclusion\r\nof all other persons and all other occupations.\"\r\n\r\nThe government has, however, countenanced some infringements. A few\r\nsyndicates of municipal and departmental employees are allowed; but\r\nthey are mostly workmen, not strictly functionaries. There are several\r\nsyndicates of elementary school teachers. But they have not been\r\nallowed to federate their unions. At Lyons the teachers formed a union\r\nand, according to law, filed their rules and regulations with the\r\nproper official, who turned them over to the Minister of Justice, and\r\nafter a cabinet consultation it was decided that the union was\r\nillegal, but would be ignored. They then joined the local _Bourse du\r\nTravail_ (federation of labor), and Briand, then Minister of\r\nEducation, vetoed their action. Then a number of branches in the\r\npublic service, including post-office and customs-house employees,\r\nteachers, etc., united in forming a committee \"_pour la defense du\r\ndroit syndical des salaries de l'etat, des departements et du\r\ncommerce_.\" This \"Committee of Defense\" petitioned Clemenceau on the\r\nright to organize, and intimated that the great and only difference\r\nbetween the state and the private employer is that the former adds\r\npolitical to economic oppression. This is pure Syndicalism. Under the\r\nindividual political jugglery that takes the place of the party system\r\nin France, the problem is not made any the easier.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. PROGRAM OF THE LIBERAL WING OF THE FRENCH SOCIALISTS, ADOPTED AT\r\nTOURS, 1902, UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF JAURES\r\n\r\n\r\n_I.--Declaration of Principles_\r\n\r\nSocialism proceeds simultaneously from the movement of democracy and\r\nfrom the new forms of production. In history, from the very morrow of\r\nthe French Revolution, the proletarians perceived that the Declaration\r\nof the Rights of Man would remain an illusion unless society\r\ntransformed ownership.\r\n\r\nHow, indeed, could freedom, ownership, security, be guaranteed to all,\r\nin a society where millions of workers have no property but their\r\nmuscles, and are obliged, in order to live, to sell their power of\r\nwork to the propertied minority?\r\n\r\nTo extend, therefore, to every citizen the guarantees inscribed in the\r\nDeclaration of Rights, our great Babeuf demanded ownership in common,\r\nas a guarantee of welfare in common. Communism was for the boldest\r\nproletarians the supreme expression of the Revolution.\r\n\r\nBetween the political regime, the outcome of the revolutionary\r\nmovement, and the economic regime of society, there is an intolerable\r\ncontradiction.\r\n\r\nIn the political order democracy is realized: all citizens share\r\nequally, at least by right, in the sovereignty; universal suffrage is\r\ncommunism in political power.\r\n\r\nIn the economic order, on the other hand, a minority is sovereign. It\r\nis the oligarchy of capital which possesses, directs, administers, and\r\nexploits.\r\n\r\nProletarians are acknowledged fit as citizens to manage the milliards\r\nof the national and communal budgets; as laborers, in the workshop,\r\nthey are only a passive multitude, which has no share in the direction\r\nof enterprises, and they endure the domination of a class which makes\r\nthem pay dearly for a tutelage whose utility ceases and whose\r\nprolongation is arbitrary.\r\n\r\nThe irresistible tendency of the proletarians, therefore, is to\r\ntransfer into the economic order the democracy partially realized in\r\nthe political order. Just as all the citizens have and handle in\r\ncommon, democratically, the political power, so they must have and\r\nhandle in common the economic power, the means of production.\r\n\r\nThey must themselves appoint the heads of work in the workshops, as\r\nthey appoint the heads of government in the city, and reserve for\r\nthose who work, for the community, the whole product of work.\r\n\r\nThis tendency of political democracy to enlarge itself into social\r\ndemocracy has been strengthened and defined by the whole economic\r\nevolution.\r\n\r\nIn proportion as the capitalistic regime developed its effects, the\r\nproletariat became conscious of the irreducible opposition between its\r\nessential interests and the interests of the class dominant in\r\nsociety, and to the bourgeois form of democracy it opposed more and\r\nmore the complete and thorough communistic democracy.\r\n\r\nAll hope of universalizing ownership and independence by multiplying\r\nsmall autonomous producers has disappeared. The great industry is more\r\nand more the rule in modern production.\r\n\r\nBy the enlargement of the world's markets, by the growing facility of\r\ntransport, by the division of labor, by the increasing application of\r\nmachinery, by the concentration of capitals, immense concentrated\r\nproduction is gradually ruining or subordinating the small or middling\r\nproducers.\r\n\r\nEven where the number of small craftsmen, small traders, small peasant\r\nproprietors, does not diminish, their relative importance in the\r\ntotality of production grows less unceasingly. They fall under the\r\nsway of the great capitalists.\r\n\r\nEven the peasant proprietors, who seem to have retained a little\r\nindependence, are more and more exposed to the crushing forces of the\r\nuniversal market, which capitalism directs without their concurrence\r\nand against their interests.\r\n\r\nFor the sale of their wheat, wine, beetroot, and milk, they are more\r\nand more at the mercy of great middlemen or great industries of\r\nmilling, distilling, and sugar-refining, which dominate and despoil\r\npeasant labor.\r\n\r\nThe industrial proletarians, having lost nearly all chance of\r\nindividually rising to be employers, and being thus doomed to eternal\r\ndependence, are further subject to incessant crises of unemployment\r\nand misery, let loose by the unregulated competition of the great\r\ncapitalist forces.\r\n\r\nThe immense progress of production and wealth, largely usurped by\r\nparasitic classes, has not led to an equivalent progress in well-being\r\nand security for the workers, the proletarians. Whole categories of\r\nwage-earners are abruptly thrown into extreme misery by the constant\r\nintroduction of new mechanisms and by the abrupt movements and\r\ntransformations of industry.\r\n\r\nCapitalism itself admits the disorder of the present regime of\r\nproduction, since it tries to regulate it for its gain by capitalistic\r\nsyndicates, by trusts.\r\n\r\nEven if it succeeded in actually disciplining all the forces of\r\nproduction, it would only do so while consummating the domination and\r\nthe monopoly of capital.\r\n\r\nThere is only one way of assuring the continued order and progress of\r\nproduction, the freedom of every individual, and the growing\r\nwell-being of the workers; it is to transfer to the collectivity, to\r\nthe social community, the ownership of the capitalistic means of\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\nThe proletariat, daily more numerous, ever better prepared for\r\ncombined action by the great industry itself, understands that in\r\ncollectiveness or communism lie the necessary means of salvation for\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAs an oppressed and exploited class, it opposes all the forces of\r\noppression and exploitation, the whole system of ownership, which\r\ndebases it to be a mere instrument. It does not expect its\r\nemancipation from the good will of rulers or the spontaneous\r\ngenerosity of the propertied classes, but from the continual and\r\nmethodical pressure which it exerts upon the privileged class and the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nIt sets before itself as its final aim, not a partial amelioration,\r\nbut the total transformation of society. And since it acknowledges no\r\nright as belonging to capitalistic ownership, it feels bound to it by\r\nno contract. It is determined to fight it, thoroughly, and to the end;\r\nand it is in this sense that the proletariat, even while using the\r\nlegal means which democracy puts into its hands, is and must remain a\r\nrevolutionary class.\r\n\r\nAlready by winning universal suffrage, by winning and exercising the\r\nright of combining to strike and of forming trade-unions, by the first\r\nlaws regulating labor and causing society to insure its members, the\r\nproletariat has begun to react against the fatal effects of\r\ncapitalism; it will continue this great and unceasing effort, but it\r\nwill only end the struggle when all capitalist property has been\r\nreabsorbed by the community, and when the antagonism of classes has\r\nbeen ended by the disappearance of the classes themselves, reconciled,\r\nor rather made one, in common production and common ownership.\r\n\r\nHow will be accomplished the supreme transformation of the capitalist\r\nregime into the collectivist or communist? The human mind cannot\r\ndetermine beforehand the mode in which history will be accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe democratic and bourgeois revolution, which originated in the great\r\nmovement of France in 1789, has come about in different countries in\r\nthe most different ways. The old feudal system has yielded in one case\r\nto force, in another to peaceful and slow evolution. The revolutionary\r\nbourgeoisie has at one place and time proceeded to brutal\r\nexpropriation without compensation, at another to the buying out of\r\nfeudal servitudes.\r\n\r\nNo one can know in what way the capitalist servitude will be\r\nabolished. The essential thing is that the proletariat should be\r\nalways ready for the most vigorous and effective action. It would be\r\ndangerous to dismiss the possibility of revolutionary events\r\noccasioned either by the resistance or by the criminal aggression of\r\nthe privileged class.\r\n\r\nIt would be fatal, trusting in the one word revolution, to neglect the\r\ngreat forces which the conscious, organized proletariat can employ\r\nwithin democracy.\r\n\r\nThese legal means, often won by revolution, represent an accumulation\r\nof revolutionary force, a revolutionary capital, of which it would be\r\nmadness not to take advantage.\r\n\r\nToo often the workers neglect to profit by the means of action which\r\ndemocracy and the Republic put into their hands. They do not demand\r\nfrom trade-unionist action, co-operative action, or universal\r\nsuffrage, all that those forms of action can give.\r\n\r\nNo formula, no machinery, can enable the working-class to dispense\r\nwith the constant effort of organization and education.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the general strike, of general strikes, is invincibly\r\nsuggested to proletarians by the growing magnitude of working-class\r\norganization. They do not desire violence, which is very often the\r\nresult of an insufficient organization and a rudimentary education of\r\nthe proletariat; but they would make a great mistake if they did not\r\nemploy the powerful means of action, which co-ordinates working-class\r\nforces to subserve the great interests of the workers or of society;\r\nthey must group and organize themselves to be in a position to make\r\nthe privileged class more and more emphatically aware of the gulf\r\nwhich may suddenly be cleft open in the economic life of societies by\r\nthe abrupt stoppage of the worn-out and interminably exploited\r\nworkers. They can thereby snatch from the selfishness of the\r\nprivileged class great reforms interesting the working-class in\r\ngeneral, and hasten the complete transformation of an unjust society.\r\nBut the formula of the general strike, like the partial strike, like\r\npolitical action, is only valuable through the progress of the\r\neducation, the thought, and the will of the working-class.\r\n\r\nThe Socialist party defends the Republic as a necessary means of\r\nliberation and education. Socialism is essentially republican. It\r\nmight be even said to be the Republic itself, since it is the\r\nextension of the Republic to the regime of property and labor.\r\n\r\nThe Socialist party needs, to organize the new world, free minds,\r\nemancipated from superstitions and prejudices. It asks for and\r\nguarantees every human being, every individual, absolute freedom of\r\nthinking, and writing, and affirming their beliefs. Over against all\r\nreligions, dogmas, and churches, as well as over against the class\r\nconception of the bourgeoisie, it sets the unlimited right of free\r\nthought, the scientific conception of the universe, and a system of\r\npublic education based exclusively on science and reason.\r\n\r\nThus accustomed to free thought and reflection, citizens will be\r\nprotected against the sophistries of the capitalistic and clerical\r\nreaction. The small craftsmen, small traders, and small peasant\r\nproprietors will cease to think that it is Socialism which wishes to\r\nexpropriate them. The Socialist party will hasten the hour when these\r\nsmall peasant proprietors, ruined by the underselling of their\r\nproduce, riddled with mortgage debts, and always liable to judicial\r\nexpropriation, will eventually understand the advantages of\r\ngeneralized and systematized association, and will claim themselves,\r\nas a benefit, the socialization of their plots of land.\r\n\r\nBut it would be useless to prepare inside each nation an organization\r\nof justice and peace, if the relations of the nations to one another\r\nremained exposed to every enterprise of force, every suggestion of\r\ncapitalist greed.\r\n\r\nThe Socialist party desires peace among nations; it condemns every\r\npolicy of aggression and war, whether continental or colonial. It\r\nconstantly keeps on the order of the day for civilized countries\r\nsimultaneous disarmament. While waiting for the day of definite peace\r\namong nations, it combats the militarist spirit by doing its utmost to\r\napproximate the system of permanent armies to that of national\r\nmilitias. It wishes to protect the territory and the independence of\r\nthe nation against any surprise; but every offensive policy and\r\noffensive weapon is utterly condemned by it.\r\n\r\nThe close understanding of the workers, of the proletarians of every\r\ncountry, is necessary as well to beat back the forces of aggression\r\nand war as to prepare by a concerted action the general triumph of\r\nSocialism. The international agreement of the militant proletarians of\r\nevery country will prepare the triumph of a free humanity, where the\r\ndifferences of classes will have disappeared, and the difference of\r\nnations, instead of being a principle of strife and hatred, will be a\r\nprinciple of brotherly emulation in the universal progress of mankind.\r\n\r\nIt is in this sense and for these reasons that the Socialist party has\r\nformulated in its congresses the rule and aim of its\r\naction--international understanding of the workers; political and\r\neconomic organization of the proletariat as a class party for the\r\nconquest of government and the socialization of the means of production\r\nand exchange; that is to say, the transformation of capitalist society\r\ninto a collectivist or communist society.\r\n\r\n\r\n_II.--Program of Reforms_\r\n\r\nThe Socialist party, rejecting the policy of all or nothing, has a\r\nprogram of reforms whose realization it pursues forthwith.\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) _Democratization of Public Authorities_\r\n\r\n1.

BASIS OF THE UNITED SOCIALIST PARTY OF FRANCE\r\n\r\n_Adopted January 13, 1905_\r\n\r\nThe representatives of the various Socialistic organizations of\r\nFrance: the revolutionary Socialist Labor Party, the Socialist Party\r\nof France, the French Socialist Party, the independent federations of\r\nBouches-du-Rhone, of Bretagne, of Herault, of the Somme, and of\r\nl'Yonne, commanded by their respective parties and federations to form\r\na union upon the basis indicated by the International Congress of\r\nAmsterdam, declare that the action of a unified party should be based\r\nupon the principles established by the International Congress,\r\nespecially those held in France in 1900 and Amsterdam in 1904.\r\n\r\nThe divergence of views and the various interpretations of the tactics\r\nof the Socialists which have prevailed up to the present moment have\r\nbeen due to circumstances peculiar to France and to the absence of a\r\ngeneral party organization.\r\n\r\nThe delegates declare their common desire to form a party based upon\r\nthe class war which, at the same time, will utilize to its profit the\r\nstruggles of the laboring classes and unite their action with that of\r\na political party organized for the defense of the rights of the\r\nproletariat, whose interests will always rest in a party fundamentally\r\nand irreconcilably opposed to all the bourgeois classes and to the\r\nstate which is their instrument.\r\n\r\nTherefore the delegates declare that their respective organizations\r\nare prepared to collaborate immediately in this work of the\r\nunification of all the Socialistic forces in France, upon the\r\nfollowing basis, unanimously adopted:\r\n\r\n1. The Socialist Party is a class party which has for its aim the\r\nsocialization of the means of production and exchange, that is to say,\r\nto transform the present capitalistic society into a collective or\r\ncommunistic society by means of the political and economic\r\norganization of the proletariat. By its aims, by its ideals, by the\r\npower which it employs, the Socialist Party, always seeking to realize\r\nthe immediate reforms demanded by the working class, is not a party of\r\nreforms, but a party of class war and revolution.\r\n\r\n2. The members of Parliament elected by the party form a unique group\r\nopposed to all the factions of the bourgeois parties. The Socialist\r\ngroup in Parliament must refuse to sustain all of those means which\r\nassure the domination of the bourgeoisie in government and their\r\nmaintenance in power: must therefore refuse to vote for military\r\nappropriations, appropriations for colonial conquest, secret funds,\r\nand the budget.\r\n\r\nEven in the most exceptional circumstances the Socialist members must\r\nnot pledge the party without its consent.\r\n\r\nIn Parliament the Socialist group must consecrate itself to defending\r\nand extending the political liberties and rights of the working\r\nclasses and to the realization of those reforms which ameliorate the\r\nconditions of life in the struggle for existence of the working class.\r\n\r\nThe deputies should always hold themselves at the disposition of the\r\nparty, giving themselves to the general propaganda, the organization\r\nof the proletariat, and constantly working toward the ultimate goal of\r\nSocialism.\r\n\r\n3. Every member of the legislature individually, as well as each\r\nmilitant Socialist, is subject to the control of his federation; all\r\nof the officials in all of the groups are subject to the central\r\norganization. In every case the national congress has the final\r\njurisdiction over all party matters.\r\n\r\n4. There shall be complete freedom of discussion in the press\r\nconcerning questions of principle and policy, but the conduct of all\r\nthe Socialist publications must be strictly in accord with the\r\ndecisions of the national congress as interpreted by the executive\r\ncommittee of the party. Journals which are or may become the property\r\nof the party, either of the national party or of the federations, will\r\nnaturally be placed under the management of authorities permanently\r\nestablished for that purpose by the party or the federations. Journals\r\nwhich are not the property of the party, but proclaim themselves as\r\nSocialistic, must conform strictly to the resolutions of the congress\r\nas interpreted by the proper party authorities, and they should insert\r\nall the official communications of the party and party notices, as\r\nthey may be requested to do. The central committee of the party may\r\nremind such journals of the policies of the party, and if they are\r\nrecalcitrant may propose to the congress that all intercourse between\r\nthem and the party be broken.\r\n\r\n5. Members of Parliament shall not be appointed members of the central\r\ncommittee, but they shall be represented on the central committee by a\r\ncommittee equal to one-tenth of the number of delegates, and in no\r\ncase shall their representation be less than five. The Federation\r\nshall not appoint as delegates to the Central Committee \"_militants_\"\r\nwho reside within the limits of the Federation.\r\n\r\n6. The party will take measures for insuring, on the part of the\r\nofficials, respect for the mandates of the party, and will fix the\r\namount of their assessment.\r\n\r\n7. A congress charged with the definite organization of the party will\r\nbe convened as soon as possible upon the basis of proportional\r\nrepresentation fixed, first upon the number of members paying dues,\r\nand second upon the number of votes cast in the general elections of\r\n1902.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. GERMANY\r\n\r\n1. POLITICAL PARTIES IN GERMANY\r\n\r\nThere are a great many \"fractions\" in German politics. But, following\r\nthe Continental custom, they are all grouped into three divisions, the\r\nLeft or Radical, Right or Conservative, and the Center. In Germany the\r\nCenter is the Catholic or Clerical Party. The leading groups are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n1. _Conservative._--The \"German Conservatives\" are the old tories; the\r\n\"Free Conservatives\" profess, but rarely show, a tendency toward\r\nliberal ideas, although they have, at intervals, opposed ministerial\r\nmeasures. The Conservatives are for the Government (Regierung) first,\r\nlast, and all the time. They were a powerful factor under Bismarck and\r\ndocile in his hands. Since his day they have suffered many defeats\r\nbecause of their reactionary policy. But the group still is the\r\nKaiser's party, the stronghold of modern medievalism, opposed to\r\nradical reforms, and adhering to \"the grace of God\" policy of\r\nmonarchism. Economically they are _junker_ and \"big business.\" The\r\nanti-Socialist laws were the expression of their ideas as to Socialism\r\nand the way to quench it.\r\n\r\n2. _National Liberal._--This party is not liberal, in the sense that\r\nEngland or America knows liberalism. It is really only a less\r\nconservative party than the extreme Right, although it began as the\r\nbrilliant Progressist Party of the early '60's. It was triumphant in\r\nthe Prussian Diet until Bismarck shattered it on his war policy. In\r\nthe first Reichstag it had 116 members, nearly one-third of the whole.\r\nBut Bismarck needed it, got it, and left it quite as conservative as\r\nhe wished. It voted for the anti-Socialist laws and for state\r\ninsurance.\r\n\r\n3. _Progressive_ (_Freisinnige_, literally, \"free-minded\").--This\r\nfaction is a cession from the old Progressist Party of which Lassalle\r\nwas a member for a few months. They are Radicals of a very moderate\r\ntype, and are opposed to the junker bureaucracy. There are two\r\nwings--the People's Party (_Freisinnige Volkspartei_) and the\r\nProgressive Union (_Freisinnige Vereinigung_). It is a constitutional\r\nparty, and has counted in its ranks such eminent scholars as Professor\r\nVirchow and Professor Theodor Mommsen. They are in favor of\r\nministerial responsibility, are free traders of the Manchester type,\r\nopposed to state intervention and state insurance, but favor factory\r\ninspection, sanitation, and other social legislation. They are in\r\nfavor of freedom in religion, trade, and education, and espouse ballot\r\nreform. They have a well-organized party, but do not seem effective\r\nin winning elections. They share, to some degree, with the Social\r\nDemocrats the prejudice of the religious folk against free-thinking\r\nand religious latitudinarianism. It is the middle-class party of\r\nprotest against bureaucracy.\r\n\r\n4. The _Center_, or Catholic Party, is a homogeneous, isolated,\r\nwell-disciplined, inflexible group, dominated by loyalty to their\r\nreligion. Whenever they have co-operated with the government it has\r\nbeen in return for favors shown. The ranks of this party were closed\r\nby the _Culturkampf_, which resulted in the expulsion of the Jesuit\r\norders and the separation of the elementary schools from the Church.\r\nThe party is reactionary in politics and economics.\r\n\r\n5. _Anti-Semitic._--The name discloses the ideals of a party inspired\r\nby dread and hatred of an element that comprises less than 1.5 per\r\ncent. of the population, and whose political disabilities were not all\r\nremoved until 1850 in Prussia and 1869 in Mecklenburg. This party was\r\nformed in 1880, largely through the agitation of the Court Chaplain,\r\nPastor Stoecker, whose diatribes were peculiarly effective in Berlin,\r\nwhere some very disgraceful scenes were enacted by members of this\r\nparty.\r\n\r\n6. _Independent groups_ are formed by the various nationalities that\r\nare under subjection to German dominance. These are the Danish,\r\nHannoverian, Alsace-Lorraine, and Polish groups. They usually are\r\ngrouped with the Center.\r\n\r\n7. There are also a number of independent members in the Reichstag.\r\nThey adhere loosely to the larger groups, but as a rule merit the name\r\ngiven them--_Wilden_, \"wild ones.\"\r\n\r\nThe accompanying table (p. 297) shows the distribution of seats in the\r\nReichstag, for the past thirty years.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. SOME MODERN GERMAN ELECTION LAWS\r\n\r\n_Analysis of the New Election Law of Saxony_\r\n\r\n  _A._ One vote--every male 25 years of age.\r\n\r\n  _B._ Two votes, every male, as follows:\r\n\r\n      1. Those who have an annual income of over 1,600 marks\r\n          ($400).\r\n\r\n      2. Those who hold public office or a permanent private\r\n          position with an annual income of over 1,400 marks ($350).\r\n\r\n      3. Those who are eligible to vote for Landskulturrat\r\n          (Agricultural Board) or Gewerbskammer (Chamber of\r\n          Commerce) and from their business have an income of over\r\n          1,400 marks. (This includes merchants, landowners, and\r\n          manufacturers.)\r\n\r\n      4. Those who are owners or beneficiaries of property in the\r\n          kingdom from which they have an income of 1,250 marks\r\n          ($312.50) a year, and upon which at least 100 tax units\r\n          are assessed.\r\n\r\n      5. Those who own, or are beneficiaries of, land in the\r\n          kingdom, to the extent of at least 2 hectares, devoted to\r\n          agriculture, or forestry, or horticulture, or more than\r\n          one-half hectare devoted to gardening or wine culture.\r\n\r\n      6. Those who have conducted such professional studies as\r\n          entitle them to the one-year volunteer military service.\r\n\r\n  _C._ The following have three votes:\r\n\r\n      1. Those who have an income of over 2,200 marks ($550).\r\n\r\n      2. Those in division B, 2 and 3, who have an income from\r\n          office or position of over 1,900 marks ($475).\r\n\r\n      3.

Those in B, 5, with 8 hectares devoted to agriculture or 2\r\n          hectares devoted to gardening or wine culture.\r\n\r\n  _E._ Voters over 50 years old have an extra vote (Alters-stimme),\r\n      but no voter is allowed over four votes.\r\n\r\nSachsen-Altenburg, in 1908-9, modified its election laws as follows:\r\nThe legislature is composed of 9 representatives elected by the\r\ncities; 12 by the rural districts; 7 by the highest taxpayers; one\r\neach by the Chamber of Commerce, the Board of Agriculture, the Craft\r\nguilds (Handwerks-kammer), and the Labor Council (Arbeiter-kammer).\r\nThe vigorous protest of the Social Democrats did not avail against the\r\npassage of this law.\r\n\r\nSaxe-Weimar recently modified its election law as follows: All\r\ncitizens of communes were given the right to vote. The great feudal\r\nestates (165 persons in 1909) elect 5 representatives to the Diet; the\r\nrest of the highest taxpayers, i.e., those who have a taxable income\r\nof over 3,000 marks, elect 5. The University of Jena elects 1 member,\r\nthe Chamber of Commerce 1, the Handwerks-kammer (Craft Guilds) 1,\r\nLandwirthschaftkammer (Agricultural Board) 1, the Arbeitskammer (Labor\r\nCouncil) 1. There are 38 members in the Diet: the remaining 23 are\r\nelected at large.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.

PROGRAM OF THE GERMAN SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY\r\n\r\n_Adopted at Erfurt, 1891_\r\n\r\nThe economic development of bourgeois society leads by natural\r\nnecessity to the downfall of the small industry, whose foundation is\r\nformed by the worker's private ownership of his means of production.\r\nIt separates the worker from his means of production, and converts him\r\ninto a propertyless proletarian, while the means of production become\r\nthe monopoly of a relatively small number of capitalists and large\r\nlandowners.\r\n\r\nHand-in-hand with this monopolization of the means of production goes\r\nthe displacement of the dispersed small industries by colossal great\r\nindustries, the development of the tool into the machine, and a\r\ngigantic growth in the productivity of human labor. But all the\r\nadvantages of this transformation are monopolized by capitalists and\r\nlarge landowners. For the proletariat and the declining intermediate\r\nclasses--petty bourgoisie and peasants--it means a growing\r\naugmentation of the insecurity of their existence, of misery,\r\noppression, enslavement, debasement, and exploitation.\r\n\r\nEver greater grows the number of proletarians, ever more enormous the\r\narmy of surplus workers, ever sharper the opposition between\r\nexploiters and exploited, ever bitterer the class-war between\r\nbourgeoisie and proletariat, which divides modern society into two\r\nhostile camps, and is the common hall-mark of all industrial\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nThe gulf between the propertied and the propertyless is further\r\nwidened through the crises, founded in the essence of the capitalistic\r\nmethod of production, which constantly become more comprehensive and\r\nmore devastating, which elevate general insecurity to the normal\r\ncondition of society, and which prove that the powers of production of\r\ncontemporary society have grown beyond measure, and that private\r\nownership of the means of production has become incompatible with\r\ntheir application to their objects and their full development.\r\n\r\nPrivate ownership of the means of production, which was formerly the\r\nmeans of securing to the producer the ownership of his product, has\r\nto-day become the means of expropriating peasants, manual workers, and\r\nsmall traders, and enabling the non-workers--capitalists and large\r\nlandowners--to own the product of the workers. Only the transformation\r\nof capitalistic private ownership of the means of production--the\r\nsoil, mines, raw materials, tools, machines, and means of\r\ntransport--into social ownership and the transformation of production\r\nof goods for sale into Socialistic production managed for and through\r\nsociety, can bring it about, that the great industry and the steadily\r\ngrowing productive capacity of social labor shall for the hitherto\r\nexploited classes be changed from a source of misery and oppression\r\nto a source of the highest welfare and of all-round harmonious\r\nperfection.\r\n\r\nThis social transformation means the emancipation not only of the\r\nproletariat, but of the whole human race which suffers under the\r\nconditions of to-day. But it can only be the work of the\r\nworking-class, because all the other classes, in spite of mutually\r\nconflicting interests, take their stand on the basis of private\r\nownership of the means of production, and have as their common object\r\nthe preservation of the principles of contemporary society.\r\n\r\nThe battle of the working-class against capitalistic exploitation is\r\nnecessarily a political battle. The working-class cannot carry on its\r\neconomic battles or develop its economic organization without\r\npolitical rights. It cannot effect the passing of the means of\r\nproduction into the ownership of the community without acquiring\r\npolitical power.\r\n\r\nTo shape this battle of the working-class into a conscious and united\r\neffort, and to show it its naturally necessary end, is the object of\r\nthe Social Democratic Party.\r\n\r\nThe interests of the working-class are the same in all lands with\r\ncapitalistic methods of production. With the expansion of\r\nworld-transport and production for the world-market the state of the\r\nworkers in any one country becomes constantly more dependent on the\r\nstate of the workers in other countries. The emancipation of the\r\nworking-class is thus a task in which the workers of all civilized\r\ncountries are concerned in a like degree. Conscious of this, the\r\nSocial Democratic Party of Germany feels and declares itself _one_\r\nwith the class-conscious workers of all other lands.\r\n\r\nThe Social Democratic Party of Germany fights thus not for new\r\nclass-privileges and exceptional rights, but for the abolition of\r\nclass-domination and of the classes themselves, and for the equal\r\nrights and equal obligations of all, without distinction of sex and\r\nparentage. Setting out from these views, it combats in contemporary\r\nsociety not merely the exploitation and oppression of the\r\nwage-workers, but every kind of exploitation and oppression, whether\r\ndirected against a class, a party, a sex, or a race.\r\n\r\nSetting out from these principles the Social Democratic Party of\r\nGermany demands immediately--\r\n\r\n1. Universal equal direct suffrage and franchise, with direct ballot,\r\nfor all members of the Empire over twenty years of age, without\r\ndistinction of sex, for all elections and acts of voting. Proportional\r\nrepresentation; and until this is introduced, re-division of the\r\nconstituencies by law according to the numbers of population. A new\r\nLegislature every two years. Fixing of elections and acts of voting\r\nfor a legal holiday. Indemnity for the elected representatives.\r\nRemoval of every curtailment of political rights except in case of\r\ntutelage.\r\n\r\n2. Direct legislation by the people by means of the initiative and\r\nreferendum. Self-determination and self-government of the people in\r\nempire, state, province, and commune. Authorities to be elected by the\r\npeople; to be responsible and bound. Taxes to be voted annually.\r\n\r\n3. Education of all to be capable of bearing arms. Armed nation\r\ninstead of standing army. Decision of war and peace by the\r\nrepresentatives of the people. Settlement of all international\r\ndisputes by the method of arbitration.\r\n\r\n4. Abolition of all laws which curtail or suppress the free expression\r\nof opinion and the right of association and assembly.\r\n\r\n5. Abolition of all laws which are prejudicial to women in their\r\nrelations to men in public or private law.\r\n\r\n6. Declaration that religion is a private matter. Abolition of all\r\ncontributions from public funds to ecclesiastical and religious\r\nobjects. Ecclesiastical and religious communities are to be treated as\r\nprivate associations, which manage their affairs quite independently.\r\n\r\n7. Secularization of education. Compulsory attendance of public\r\nprimary schools. No charges to be made for instruction, school\r\nrequisites, and maintenance, in the public primary schools; nor in the\r\nhigher educational institutions for those students, male and female,\r\nwho in virtue of their capacities are considered fit for further\r\ntraining.\r\n\r\n8. No charge to be made for the administration of the law, or for\r\nlegal assistance. Judgment by popularly elected judges. Appeal in\r\ncriminal cases. Indemnification of innocent persons prosecuted,\r\narrested, or condemned. Abolition of the death-penalty.\r\n\r\n9. No charges to be made for medical attendance, including midwifery\r\nand medicine. No charges to be made for death certificates.\r\n\r\n10. Graduated taxes on income and property, to meet all public\r\nexpenses as far as these are to be covered by taxation. Obligatory\r\nself-assessment. A tax on inheritance, graduated according to the size\r\nof the inheritance and the degree of kinship. Abolition of all\r\nindirect taxes, customs, and other politico-economic measures which\r\nsacrifice the interests of the whole community to the interests of a\r\nfavored minority.\r\n\r\nFor the protection of the working-class the Social Democratic Party of\r\nGermany demands immediately--\r\n\r\n1. An effective national and international legislation for the\r\nprotection of workmen on the following basis:\r\n\r\n(_a_) Fixing of a normal working-day with a maximum of eight hours.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Prohibition of industrial work for children under fourteen\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Prohibition of night-work, except for such branches of industry\r\nas, in accordance with their nature, require night-work, for technical\r\nreasons, or reasons of public welfare.\r\n\r\n(_d_) An uninterrupted rest of at least thirty-six hours in every week\r\nfor every worker.\r\n\r\n(_e_) Prohibition of the truck system.\r\n\r\n2. Inspection of all industrial businesses, investigation and\r\nregulation of labor relations in town and country by an Imperial\r\nDepartment of Labor, district labor departments, and chambers of\r\nlabor. Thorough industrial hygiene.\r\n\r\n3. Legal equalization of agricultural laborers and domestic servants\r\nwith industrial workers; removal of the special regulations affecting\r\nservants.\r\n\r\n4. Assurance of the right of combination.\r\n\r\n5. Workmen's insurance to be taken over bodily by the Empire; and the\r\nworkers to have an influential share in its administration.\r\n\r\n6. Separation of the Churches and the State.\r\n\r\n(_a_) Suppression of the grant for public worship.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Philosophic or religious associations to be civil persons at\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\n7. Revision of sections in the Civil Code concerning marriage and the\r\npaternal authority.\r\n\r\n(_a_) Civil equality of the sexes, and of children, whether natural or\r\nlegitimate.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Revision of the divorce laws, maintaining the husband's\r\nliability to support the wife or the children.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Inquiry into paternity to be legalized.\r\n\r\n(_d_) Protective measures in favor of children materially or morally\r\nabandoned.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.

ELECTION ADDRESS (WAHLRUF) OF THE GERMAN SOCIAL DEMOCRATS FOR THE\r\nREICHSTAG ELECTIONS OF 1912\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of January, 1912, the general election for the Reichstag\r\ntakes place. Rarely have the voters been called upon to participate in\r\na more consequential election. This election will determine whether,\r\nin the succeeding years, the policy of oppression and plundering\r\nshall be carried still farther, or whether the German people shall\r\nfinally achieve their rights.\r\n\r\nIn the Reichstag elections of 1907 the voters were deceived by the\r\ngovernment and the so-called national parties: many millions of voters\r\nallowed themselves to be deluded. The Reichstag of the \"National\"\r\n_bloc_ from Heydebrand down to Weimar and Nauman has made nugatory the\r\nlaws pertaining to the rights of coalition; has restricted the use of\r\nthe non-Germanic languages in public meetings; has virtually robbed\r\nthe youth of the right of coalition, and has favored every measure for\r\nthe increase of the army, navy, and colonial exploitation.\r\n\r\nThe result of their reactionaryism is an enormous increase of the\r\nburdens of taxation. In spite of the fact that in 1906 over\r\n200,000,000 marks increase was voted, in stamp tax, tobacco tax, etc.,\r\nin spite of the sacred promise of the government, through its official\r\norgan, that no new taxes were being contemplated, the government has,\r\nthrough its \"financial reforms,\" increased our burden over five\r\nhundred millions.\r\n\r\nLiberals and Conservatives were unanimous in declaring that\r\nfour-fifths of this enormous sum should be raised through an increase\r\nin indirect taxes, the greater part of which is collected from\r\nlaborers, clerks, shopkeepers, artisans, and farmers. Inasmuch as the\r\nparties to the Buelow-_bloc_ could not agree upon the distribution of\r\nthe property tax and the excise tax, the _bloc_ was dissolved and a\r\nnew coalition appeared--an alliance between the holy ones and the\r\nknights (Block der Ritter und der Heiligen). This new _bloc_ rescued\r\nthe distiller from the obligations of an excise tax, defeated the\r\ninheritance tax, which would have fallen upon the wealthy, and placed\r\nupon the shoulders of the working people a tax of hundreds of\r\nmillions, which is paid through the consumption of beer, whiskey,\r\ntobacco, cigars, coffee, tea--yea, even of matches. This\r\nConservative-Clerical _bloc_ further showed its contempt for the\r\nworking people in the way it amended the state insurance laws. It\r\nrobbed the workingman of his rights and denied to mothers and their\r\nbabes necessary protection and adequate care.\r\n\r\nIn this manner the gullibility of the voters who were responsible for\r\nthe Hottentot elections of 1907 was revenged. Since that date every\r\nby-election for the Reichstag, as well as for the provincial\r\nlegislatures and municipal councils, has shown remarkable gains in the\r\nSocial Democratic vote. The reactionaries were consequently\r\nfrightened, and now they resort to the usual election trick of\r\ndiverting the attention of the voters from internal affairs to\r\ninternational conditions, and appeal to them under the guise of\r\nnationalism.\r\n\r\nThe Morocco incident gave welcome opportunity for this ruse. At home\r\nand abroad the capitalistic war interests and the nationalistic\r\njingoes stirred the animosities of the peoples. They drove their\r\ndangerous play so far that even the Chancellor found himself forced to\r\nreprimand his _junker_ colleagues for using their patriotism for\r\npartisan purposes. But the attempt to bolster up the interests of the\r\nreactionary parties with our international complications continues in\r\nspite of this.\r\n\r\nVoters, be on your guard! Remember that on election day you have in\r\nyour hand the power to choose between peace or war.\r\n\r\nThe outcome of this election is no less important in its bearing upon\r\ninternal affairs.\r\n\r\nCount Buelow declared, before the election of 1907, \"the fewer the\r\nSocial Democrats, the greater the social reforms.\" The opposite is\r\ntrue. The last few years conclusively demonstrate this. The\r\nsocio-political mills have rattled, but they have produced very little\r\nflour.\r\n\r\nIn order to capture their votes for the \"national\" candidates, the\r\nstate employees and officials were promised an increase in their pay.\r\nTo the high-salaried officials the new Reichstag doled out the\r\nincrease with spades, to the poorly paid humble employees with spoons.\r\nAnd this increase in pay was counterbalanced by an increase in taxes\r\nand the rising cost of living.\r\n\r\nTo the people the government refused to give any aid, in spite of\r\ntheir repeated requests for some relief against the constantly\r\nincreasing prices of the necessities of life. And, while the\r\nChancellor profoundly maintained that the press exaggerated the actual\r\nconditions of the rise in prices, the so-called saviors of the middle\r\nclass--the Center, the Conservatives, the anti-Semites and their\r\nfollowing--rejected every proposal of the Social Democrats for\r\nrelieving the situation, and actually laid the blame for the rise in\r\nprices upon their own middle-class tradesmen and manufacturers.\r\n\r\n_New taxes, high cost of living, denial of justice, increasing danger\r\nof war_--that is what the Reichstag of 1907, which was ushered in with\r\nsuch high-sounding \"national\" tom-toms, has brought you. And the day\r\nof reckoning is at hand. Voters of Germany, elect a different\r\nmajority! The stronger you make the Social Democratic representation\r\nin the Reichstag, the firmer you anchor the world's peace and your\r\ncountry's welfare!\r\n\r\nThe Social Democracy seeks the conquest of political power, which is\r\nnow in the hands of the property classes, and is mis-used by them to\r\nthe detriment of the masses. They denounce us as \"revolutionists.\"\r\nFoolish phraseology! The bourgeois-capitalistic society is no more\r\neternal than have been the earlier forms of the state and preceding\r\nsocial orders. The present order will be replaced by a higher order,\r\nthe Socialistic order, for which the Social Democracy is constantly\r\nstriving. Then the solidarity of all peoples will be accomplished and\r\nlife will be made more humane for all. The pathway to this new social\r\norder is being paved by our capitalistic development, which contains\r\nall the germs of the New Order within itself.\r\n\r\nFor us the duty is prescribed to use every means at hand for the\r\namelioration of existing evils, and to create conditions that will\r\nraise the standard of living of the masses.\r\n\r\nTherefore we demand:\r\n\r\n1. The democratizing of the state in all of its activities. An open\r\npathway to opportunity. A chance for every one to develop his\r\naptitudes. Special privileges to none. The right person in the right\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n2. Universal, direct, equal, secret ballot for all persons twenty\r\nyears of age without distinction of sex, and for all representative\r\nlegislative bodies. Referendum for setting aside the present unjust\r\nelection district apportionment and its attendant electoral abuses.\r\n\r\n3. A parliamentary government. Responsible ministry. Establishment of\r\na department for the control of foreign affairs. Giving the people's\r\nrepresentatives in the Reichstag the power to declare war or maintain\r\npeace. Consent of the Reichstag to all state appropriations.\r\n\r\n4. Organization of the national defense along democratic lines.\r\nMilitia service for all able-bodied men. Reducing service in the\r\nstanding army to the lowest terms consistent with safety. Training\r\nyouth in the use of arms. Abolition of the privilege of one-year\r\nvolunteer service. Abolition of all unnecessary expense for uniforms\r\nin army and navy.\r\n\r\n5. Abolition of \"class-justice\" and of administrative injustice.\r\nReform of the penal code, along lines of modern culture and\r\njurisprudence. Abolition of all privileges pertaining to the\r\nadministration of justice.\r\n\r\n6. Security to all workingmen, employees, and officials in their right\r\nto combine, to meet, and to organize.\r\n\r\n7. Establishment of a national Department of Labor, officials of this\r\nDepartment to be elected by the interests represented upon the basis\r\nof universal and equal suffrage. Extension of factory inspection by\r\nthe participation of workingmen and workingwomen in the same.\r\nLegalized universal eight-hour day, shortening the hours of labor in\r\nindustries that are detrimental to health.\r\n\r\n8. Reform of industrial insurance, exemption of farm laborers and\r\ndomestic servants from contributing to insurance funds. Direct\r\nelection of representatives in the administration of the insurance\r\nfunds; enlarging the representation of labor on the board of\r\ndirectors; increasing the amounts paid workingmen; lowering age for\r\nold-age pensions from 70 to 65 years; aid to expectant mothers; and\r\nfree medical attendance.\r\n\r\n9. Complete religious freedom. Separation of Church and State, and of\r\nschool and Church. No support of any kind, from public funds, for\r\nreligious purposes.\r\n\r\n10. Universal, free schools as the basis of all education. Free\r\ntext-books. Freedom for art and science.\r\n\r\n11. Diminution and ultimate abolition of all indirect taxes, and\r\nabolition of all taxes on the necessities of life. Abolition of duties\r\non foodstuffs. Limiting the restrictions upon the importation of\r\ncattle, fowl, and meat to the necessary sanitary measures. Reduction\r\nin the tariff, especially in those schedules which encourage the\r\ndevelopment of syndicates and pools, thereby enabling products of\r\nGerman manufacture to be sold cheaper abroad than at home.\r\n\r\n12. The support of all measures that tend to develop commerce and\r\ntrade. Abolition of tax on railway tickets. A stamp tax on bills of\r\nlading.\r\n\r\n13. A graduated income, property, and inheritance tax; inasmuch as\r\nthis is the most effective way of dampening the ardor of the rich for\r\na constantly increasing army and navy.\r\n\r\n14. Internal improvements and colonization; the transformation of\r\ngreat estates into communal holdings, thereby making possible a\r\ngreater food supply and a corresponding lowering of prices. The\r\nestablishment of public farms and agricultural schools. The\r\nreclamation of swamp-lands, moors, and dunes. The cessation of foreign\r\ncolonization now done for the purpose of exploiting foreign peoples\r\nfor the sake of gain.\r\n\r\nVoters of Germany! New naval and military appropriations await you;\r\nthese will increase the burdens of your taxes by hundreds of millions.\r\nAs on former occasions, so now the ruling class will attempt to roll\r\nthese heavy burdens upon the shoulders of the humble, and thereby\r\nincrease the burden of existence of the family.\r\n\r\nTherefore, let the women, upon whom the burden of the household\r\nprimarily rests, and who are to-day without political rights, take\r\nactive part in this work of emancipation and join themselves with\r\ndetermination to our cause, which is also their cause.\r\n\r\nVoters of Germany! If you are in accord with these principles, then\r\ngive your votes on the 12th of January to the Social Democratic Party.\r\nHelp prepare the foundations for a new and better state whose motto\r\nshall be:\r\n\r\nDeath to Want and Idleness! Work, Bread, and Justice for all!\r\n\r\nLet your battle-cry on election day resound: Long live the Social\r\nDemocracy!\r\n\r\n                     EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC\r\n                      REPRESENTATION IN THE REICHSTAG.\r\n\r\n  BERLIN, December 5, 1911.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Personal tax; tax on movables; tax on land; door and window tax.\r\n\r\n[2] A license to trade is required for many businesses in France.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. BELGIUM\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL UNIONISM IN BELGIUM\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Catholic Church essayed to organize in Belgium a \"Christian\r\nSocialist\" movement, patterned after Bishop Kettler's movement in the\r\nRhine provinces. The movement was called \"Federation des Societes\r\nOuvriers Catholiques\" and grew to considerable power. The federation\r\nsoon, however, developed democratic tendencies that separated it from\r\nthe Clerical Party, and the Abbe Daens, their first deputy in the\r\nChamber of Representatives, provoked the hostility of the\r\necclesiastical authorities and was deprived of his clerical\r\nprerogatives.\r\n\r\nThe Catholic labor unions, which did not join in this democratic\r\nmovement, have in the last few years developed some strength, and have\r\nnow about 20,000 members.\r\n\r\nThe Progressists or Radicals have from the first been favorable to\r\nlabor and have in their ranks many workmen from the industries \"de\r\nluxe,\" such as bronze workers, jewelers, art craftsmen, etc.\r\n\r\nThe Liberals have a trades-union organization which does not flourish.\r\nIt has about 2,000 members. The Liberals have, however, together with\r\nthe Progressists, some influence over the independent unions, with\r\ntheir 32,000 members.\r\n\r\nThe Socialist labor unions are the largest and most powerful. Their\r\naverage yearly membership in the years 1885-90 was 40,234; in 1899 it\r\nwas 61,451; in 1909 it had increased to 103,451.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATISTICAL TABLES\r\n\r\nTABLE SHOWING THE DEVELOPMENT OF CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETIES IN BELGIUM\r\n\r\n  =======+===========+============+===========+=========+\r\n         |           |            |           |         |\r\n         |  _No. of  | _Sales--   | _Profits--| _No. of |\r\n  _Year_ | Societies_| Francs_    | Francs_   | Members_|\r\n  -------+-----------+------------+-----------+---------+\r\n   1904  |    168    | 26,936,873 | 3,140,210 | 103,349 |\r\n   1905  |    161    | 28,174,563 | 3,035,941 | 119,581 |\r\n   1906  |    162    | 33,569,359 | 3,493,586 | 126,993 |\r\n   1907  |    166    | 39,103,673 | 3,843,568 | 134,694 |\r\n   1908  |    175    | 40,655,359 | 3,855,444 | 140,730 |\r\n   1909  |    199    | 43,288,867 | 4,678,559 | 148,042 |\r\n---------+-----------+------------+-----------+---------+\r\n  =======+===========+============+============\r\n         |    _No.   | _Value of  | _Paid-up\r\n         |     of    |  Realty    | Capital\r\n  _Year_ | Employees_|  Francs_   |  Francs_\r\n  -------+-----------+------------+------------\r\n   1904  |   1785    | 10,302,059 | 1,146,651\r\n   1905  |   1752    | 12,091,300 | 1,655,061\r\n   1906  |   1809    | 12,844,976 | 1,694,878\r\n   1907  |   2093    | 14,280,955 | 1,940,175\r\n   1908  |   2128    | 14,837,114 | 1,942,266\r\n   1909  |   2223    | 15,850,158 | 1,893,616\r\n---------+-----------+------------+------------\r\n\r\nTABLE SHOWING THE GROWTH OF THE WHOLESALE CO-OPERATIVE MOVEMENT IN\r\nBELGIUM FROM THE DATE OF ITS BEGINNING IN 1901\r\n\r\n  ========+=====================\r\n          | _Amount of Business\r\n   _Year_ | Done--Francs_\r\n  --------+---------------------\r\n    1901  |        760,356\r\n    1902  |      1,211,439\r\n    1903  |      1,485,573\r\n    1904  |      1,608,475\r\n    1905  |      2,219,842\r\n    1906  |      2,416,372\r\n    1907  |      2,796,196\r\n    1908  |      2,995,615\r\n    1909  |      3,221,849\r\n    1910  |      4,489,996\r\n  --------+---------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGRAM OF THE BELGIAN LABOR PARTY\r\n\r\n_Adopted at Brussels in 1893_\r\n\r\n\r\nDECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES\r\n\r\n1. The constituents of wealth in general, and in particular the means\r\nof production, are either natural agencies or the fruit of the\r\nlabor--manual and mental--of previous generations besides the present;\r\nconsequently they must be considered the common heritage of mankind.\r\n\r\n2. The right of individuals or groups to enjoy this heritage can be\r\nbased only on social utility, and aimed only at securing for every\r\nhuman being the greatest possible sum of freedom and well-being.\r\n\r\n3. The realization of this ideal is incompatible with the maintenance\r\nof the capitalistic regime, which divides society into two necessarily\r\nantagonistic classes--the one able to enjoy property without working,\r\nthe other obliged to relinquish a part of its product to the\r\npossessing class.\r\n\r\n4. The workers can only expect their complete emancipation from the\r\nsuppression of classes and a radical transformation of existing\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nThis transformation will be in favor, not only of the proletariat, but\r\nof mankind as a whole; nevertheless, as it is contrary to the\r\nimmediate interests of the possessing class, the emancipation of the\r\nworkers will be essentially the work of the workers themselves.\r\n\r\n5. In economic matters their aim must be to secure the free use,\r\nwithout charge, of all the means of production. This result can only\r\nbe attained, in a society where collective labor is more and more\r\nreplacing individual labor, by the collective appropriation of natural\r\nagencies and the instruments of labor.\r\n\r\n6. The transformation of the capitalistic regime into a collectivist\r\nregime must necessarily be accompanied by correlative transformations--\r\n\r\n(_a_) In _morals_, by the development of altruistic feelings and the\r\npractice of solidarity.\r\n\r\n(_b_) In _politics_, by the transformation of the State into a\r\nbusiness management (_administration des choses_).\r\n\r\n7. Socialism must, therefore, pursue simultaneously the economic,\r\nmoral, and political emancipation of the proletariat. Nevertheless,\r\nthe economic point of view must be paramount, for the concentration of\r\ncapital in the hands of a single class forms the basis of all the\r\nother forms of its domination.\r\n\r\nTo realize its principles the Labor Party declares--\r\n\r\n(1) That it considers itself as the representative, not only of the\r\nworking-class, but of all the oppressed, without distinction of\r\nnationality, worship, race, or sex.\r\n\r\n(2) That the Socialists of all countries must make common cause (_etre\r\nsolidaires_), the emancipation of the workers being not a national,\r\nbut an international work.\r\n\r\n(3) That in their struggle against the capitalist class the workers\r\nmust fight by every means in their power, and particularly by\r\npolitical action, by the development of free associations, and by the\r\nceaseless propagation of Socialistic principles.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--POLITICAL PROGRAM\r\n\r\n1. _Electoral reform._\r\n\r\n(_a_) Universal suffrage without distinction of sex for all ranks\r\n(age-limit, twenty-one; residence, six months).\r\n\r\n(_b_) Proportional representation.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Election expenses to be charged on the public authorities.\r\n\r\n(_d_) Payment of elected persons.\r\n\r\n(_e_) Elected persons to be bound by pledges, according to law.\r\n\r\n(_f_) Electorates to have the right of unseating elected persons.\r\n\r\n2. _Decentralization of political power._\r\n\r\n(_a_) Suppression of the Senate.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Creation of Legislative Councils, representing the different\r\nfunctions of society (industry, commerce, agriculture, education,\r\netc.); such Councils to be autonomous, within the limits of their\r\ncompetence and excepting the veto of Parliament; such Councils to be\r\nfederated, for the study and defense of their common interests.\r\n\r\n3. _Communal autonomy._\r\n\r\n(_a_) Mayors to be appointed by the electorate.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Small communes to be fused or federated.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Creation of elected committees corresponding to the different\r\nbranches of communal administration.\r\n\r\n4. _Direct legislation._\r\n\r\nRight of popular initiative and referendum in legislative, provincial,\r\nand communal matters.\r\n\r\n5. _Reform of education._\r\n\r\n(_a_) Primary, all-round, free, secular, compulsory instruction at\r\nthe expense of the State.

ENGLAND\r\n\r\nGROWTH OF SOCIALISTIC SENTIMENT IN ENGLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1885 the Earl of Wemyss made a speech in the House of Lords\r\ndeploring the advancement of state interference in business and giving\r\na resume of the Acts of Parliament that showed how \"Socialism\" invaded\r\nSt. Stephens from 1870 to 1885.\r\n\r\nHis speech is interesting, not because it voices the\r\nultra-Conservative's apprehensions but because the Earl had really\r\ndiscovered the legal basis of the new Social Democratic advance, which\r\nhad come unheralded. The Earl reviewed the bills that Parliament had\r\nsanctioned, which dealt with state \"interference.\" Twelve bills\r\nreferred to lands and houses. \"All of these measures assume the right\r\nof the state to regulate the management of, or to confiscate real\r\nproperty\"--steps in the direction of substituting \"land\r\nnationalization\" for individual ownership. Five laws dealt with\r\ncorporations, \"confiscating property of water companies,\" etc.; nine\r\ndealt with ships: \"all of them assertions by the Board of Trade of its\r\nright to regulate private enterprise and individual management in the\r\nmercantile marine;\" six with mines, \"prompting a fallacious confidence\r\nin government inspection;\" six with railways, \"all encroachments upon\r\nself-government of private enterprise in railways--successive steps in\r\nthe direction of state railways.\" Nine had to do with manufactures and\r\ntrades, \"invasions by the state of the self-government of the various\r\ninterests of the country, and curtailment of the freedom of contract\r\nbetween employers and employed.\" \"The Pawnbrokers' Act of 1872 was the\r\nthin edge of the wedge for reducing the business of the 'poor man's\r\nbanks' to a state monopoly.\" Twenty laws dealt with liquor, \"all\r\nattempts on the part of the state to regulate the dealings and habits\r\nof buyers and sellers of alcoholic drinks.\" Sixteen dealt with\r\ndwellings of the working class, \"all embodying the principle that it\r\nis the duty of the state to provide dwellings, private gardens, and\r\nother conveniences for the working classes, and assume its right to\r\nappropriate land for these purposes.\" There were nine education acts,\r\n\"all based on the assumption that it is the duty of the state to act\r\n_in loco parentis_.\" Four laws dealt with recreation, \"whereby the\r\nstate, having educated the people in common school rooms, proceeds to\r\nprovide them with common reading-rooms, and afterwards turns them out\r\nat stated times into the streets for common holidays.\"\r\n\r\nOf local government and improvement acts, there were passed \"a vast\r\nmass of local legislation ... containing interferences in every\r\nconceivable particular with liberty and property.\"\r\n\r\nThe Earl quotes Lord Palmerston as saying in 1865, \"Tenant right is\r\nlandlord wrong,\" and Lord Sherbrooke, in 1866, \"Happily there is an\r\noasis upon which all men, without distinction of party, can take\r\ncommon stand, and that is the good ground of political economy.\" And\r\nthe noble lord concludes by predicting, \"The general social results of\r\nsuch Socialistic legislation may be summed up in 'dynamite,'\r\n'detectives,' and 'general demoralization.'\"[1]\r\n\r\nIn 1887 the Earl again turned his guns upon the radical advance, but\r\nonly seven peers were on the benches to listen. In 1890 he made a\r\nthird resume under a more liberal patronage of listeners; this time\r\nthe factory laws and inspection measures came in for his especial\r\ncriticism. He said: \"Now, my lords, what is the character of all this\r\nlegislation? It is to substitute state help for self help, to regulate\r\nand control men in their dealings with one another with regard to land\r\nor anything else. The state now forbids contracts, breaks contracts,\r\nmakes contracts. The whole tendency is to substitute the state or the\r\nmunicipality for the free action of the individual.\"[2]\r\n\r\n\r\nAN EARLY POLITICAL BROADSIDE BY THE MARXIANS.\r\n\r\nThe earlier attitude of the Marxian Socialists of London toward\r\nparticipating in elections is shown in the following broadside, dated\r\nJuly, 1895:\r\n\r\n\"We, revolutionary Social Democrats, disdain to conceal our\r\nprinciples. We proclaim the class war. We hold that the lot of the\r\nworker cannot to any appreciable extent be improved except by a\r\ncomplete overthrow of this present capitalist system of society. The\r\ntime for social tinkering has gone past. Government statistics show\r\nthat the number of unemployed is slowly but surely increasing, and\r\nthat the decreases in wages greatly preponderate over the increases,\r\nand everything points to the fact that the condition of your class is\r\ngetting worse and worse.\r\n\r\n\"Refuse once for all to allow your backs to be made the stepping\r\nstones to obtain that power which they (the politicians) know only too\r\nwell how to use against you.\r\n\r\n\"Scoff at their patronizing airs and claim your rights like men.\r\nRefuse to give them that which they want, i.e., your vote. Give them\r\nno opportunity of saying that they are _your_ representatives. Refuse\r\nto be a party to the fraud of present-day politics, and\r\n\r\n          \"ABSTAIN FROM VOTING.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHRIFT INSTITUTIONS IN ENGLAND FOR SAVINGS, INSURANCE, ETC., 1907\r\n\r\n(FROM CHIOZZA MONEY--\"RICHES AND POVERTY,\" p. 56)\r\n\r\n  ----------------------------------------+--------------+--------------\r\n   _Name of Institution_                  | _Number of   | _Funds_--L\r\n                                          | Members_     |\r\n  ----------------------------------------+--------------+--------------\r\n   Building Societies                     |    623,047   |  73,289,229\r\n  ========================================+==============+==============\r\n   Ordinary Friendly Societies            |  3,418,869   |  19,346,567\r\n   Friendly Societies having branches     |  2,710,437   |  25,610,365\r\n   Collecting Friendly Societies          |  9,010,574   |   9,946,447\r\n   Benevolent Societies                   |     29,716   |     337,393\r\n   Workingmen's Clubs                     |    272,847   |     381,463\r\n   Specially Authorized Societies         |     70,980   |     532,717\r\n   Specially Authorized Loan Societies    |    141,850   |     897,784\r\n   Medical Societies                      |    313,755   |      65,513\r\n   Cattle Insurance Settlers              |      4,029   |       8,570\r\n   Shop Clubs                             |     12,207   |       1,349\r\n  ----------------------------------------+--------------+--------------\r\n      Total                               | 15,983,264   |  57,128,168\r\n  ========================================+==============+==============\r\n   Co-operative Societies, industry and   |              |\r\n     trade                                |  2,461,028   |  53,788,917\r\n   Business Co-operative Societies        |    108,550   |     984,680\r\n   Land Co-operative Societies            |     18,631   |   1,619,716\r\n  ----------------------------------------+--------------+--------------\r\n      Total                               |  2,588,209   |  56,393,313\r\n  ========================================+==============+==============\r\n   Trade Unions                           |  1,973,560   |   6,424,176\r\n   Workmen's Compensation Schemes         |     99,371   |     164,560\r\n   Friends of Labor Loan Societies        |     33,576   |     260,905\r\n  ----------------------------------------+--------------+--------------\r\n   Grand Total of Registered Provident    |              |\r\n     Societies                            | 21,301,027   | 193,660,351\r\n  ========================================+==============+==============\r\n   Railway Savings Banks                  |     64,126*  |   5,865,351@\r\n   Trustee Savings Banks                  |  1,780,214*  |  61,729,588@\r\n   Post Office Savings Banks              | 10,692,555*  | 178,033,974@\r\n  ----------------------------------------+--------------+--------------\r\n       Bank Total                         | 12,536,895   | 245,628,634\r\n  ----------------------------------------+--------------+--------------\r\n       Grand Total                        | 33,837,922   | 439,388,985\r\n  ----------------------------------------+--------------+--------------\r\n                                          | * Depositions| @ Deposits\r\n  ----------------------------------------+--------------+--------------\r\n\r\n   In this table allowance must be made for those belonging to more\r\n   than one society, and, of course, not all the depositors or\r\n   members are workingmen, especially in the savings banks and\r\n   building-societies.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSTITUTION AND STANDING ORDERS OF THE INDEPENDENT LABOR PARTY OF\r\nENGLAND\r\n\r\nSTANDING ORDERS (1911)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Contributions_\r\n\r\nAffiliation Fees and Parliamentary Fund Contributions must be paid by\r\nDecember 31st each year.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Annual Conference_\r\n\r\n1.

In this way only can the natural and acquired advantages of\r\nthe country be equitably shared by the whole people.\r\n\r\nThe Society accordingly works for the extinction of private property\r\nin land and of the consequent individual appropriation, in the form of\r\nrent, of the price paid for permission to use the earth, as well as\r\nfor the advantages of superior soils and sites.\r\n\r\nThe Society, further, works for the transfer to the community of the\r\nadministration of such industrial capital as can conveniently be\r\nmanaged socially. For, owing to the monopoly of the means of\r\nproduction in the past, industrial inventions and the transformation\r\nof surplus income into capital have mainly enriched the proprietary\r\nclass, the worker being now dependent on that class for leave to earn\r\na living.\r\n\r\nIf these measures be carried out, without compensation (though not\r\nwithout such relief to expropriated individuals as may seem fit to the\r\ncommunity), rent and interest will be added to the reward of labor,\r\nthe idle class now living on the labor of others will necessarily\r\ndisappear, and practical equality of opportunity will be maintained by\r\nthe spontaneous action of economic forces with much less interference\r\nwith personal liberty than the present system entails.\r\n\r\nFor the attainment of these ends the Fabian Society looks to the\r\nspread of Socialist opinions, and the social and political changes\r\nconsequent thereon. It seeks to promote these by the general\r\ndissemination of knowledge as to the relation between the individual\r\nand society in its economic, ethical, and political aspects.\r\n\r\nThe following questions are addressed to Parliamentary candidates by\r\nthe Fabians:\r\n\r\nWill you press at the first opportunity for the following reforms:--\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--_A Labor Program_\r\n\r\n1.

All Parliamentary elections to be held on the same day?\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROGRAM OF THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC FEDERATION, 1906\r\n\r\nOBJECT\r\n\r\nThe Socialization of the Means of Production, Distribution, and\r\nExchange, to be controlled by a Democratic State in the interests of\r\nthe entire community, and the complete Emancipation of Labor from the\r\nDomination of Capitalism and Landlordism, with the establishment of\r\nSocial and Economic Equality between the Sexes.\r\n\r\nThe economic development of modern society is characterized by the\r\nmore or less complete domination of the capitalistic mode of\r\nproduction over all branches of human labor.\r\n\r\nThe capitalistic mode of production, because it has the creation of\r\nprofit for its sole object, therefore favors the larger capital, and\r\nis based upon the divorcement of the majority of the people from the\r\ninstruments of production and the concentration of these instruments\r\nin the hands of a minority. Society is thus divided into two opposite\r\nclasses: one, the capitalists and their sleeping partners, the\r\nlandlords and loanmongers, holding in their hands the means of\r\nproduction, distribution, and exchange, and being, therefore, able to\r\ncommand the labor of others; the other, the working-class, the\r\nwage-earners, the proletariat, possessing nothing but their\r\nlabor-power, and being consequently forced by necessity to work for\r\nthe former.\r\n\r\nThe social division thus produced becomes wider and deeper with every\r\nnew advance in the application of labor-saving machinery. It is most\r\nclearly recognizable, however, in the times of industrial and\r\ncommercial crises, when, in consequence of the present chaotic\r\nconditions of carrying on national and international industry,\r\nproduction periodically comes to a standstill, and a number of the few\r\nremaining independent producers are thrown into the ranks of the\r\nproletariat. Thus, while on one hand there is incessantly going on an\r\naccumulation of capital, wealth, and power into a steadily diminishing\r\nnumber of hands, there is, on the other hand, a constantly growing\r\ninsecurity of livelihood for the mass of wage-earners, an increasing\r\ndisparity between human wants and the opportunity of acquiring the\r\nmeans for their satisfaction, and a steady physical and mental\r\ndeterioration among the more poverty-stricken of the population.\r\n\r\nBut the more this social division widens, the stronger grows the\r\nrevolt--more conscious abroad than here--of the proletariat against\r\nthe capitalist system of society in which this division and all that\r\naccompanies it have originated, and find such fruitful soil. The\r\ncapitalist mode of production, by massing the workers in large\r\nfactories, and creating an interdependence, not only between various\r\ntrades and branches of industries, but even national industries,\r\nprepares the ground and furnishes material for a universal class war.\r\nThat class war may at first--as in this country--be directed against\r\nthe abuses of the system, and not against the system itself; but\r\nsooner or later the workers must come to recognize that nothing short\r\nof the expropriation of the capitalist class, the ownership by the\r\ncommunity of the means of production, distribution, and exchange, can\r\nput an end to their abject economic condition; and then the class war\r\nwill become conscious instead of unconscious on the part of the\r\nworking-classes, and they will have for their ultimate object the\r\noverthrow of the capitalist system. At the same time, since the\r\ncapitalist class holds and uses the power of the State to safeguard\r\nits position and beat off any attack, the class war must assume a\r\npolitical character, and become a struggle on the part of the workers\r\nfor the possession of the political machinery.\r\n\r\nIt is this struggle for the conquest of the political power of the\r\nState, in order to effect a social transformation, which International\r\nSocial Democracy carries on in the name and on behalf of the\r\nworking-class. Social Democracy, therefore, is the only possible\r\npolitical party of the proletariat. The Social Democratic Federation\r\nis a part of this International Social Democracy. It, therefore, takes\r\nits stand on the above principles, and believes--\r\n\r\n1. That the emancipation of the working-class can only be achieved\r\nthrough the socialization of the means of production, distribution,\r\nand exchange, and their subsequent control by the organized community\r\nin the interests of the whole people.\r\n\r\n2. That, as the proletariat is the last class to achieve freedom, its\r\nemancipation will mean the emancipation of the whole of mankind,\r\nwithout distinction of race, nationality, creed, or sex.\r\n\r\n3. That this emancipation can only be the work of the working-class\r\nitself, organized nationally and internationally into a distinct\r\npolitical party, consciously striving after the realization of its\r\nideals; and, finally,\r\n\r\n4. That, in order to insure greater material and moral facilities for\r\nthe working-class to organize itself and to carry on the class war,\r\nthe following reforms must immediately be carried through:--\r\n\r\n\r\nIMMEDIATE REFORMS\r\n\r\n_Political_\r\n\r\nAbolition of the Monarchy.\r\n\r\nDemocratization of the Governmental machinery, viz., abolition of the\r\nHouse of Lords, payment of members of legislative and administrative\r\nbodies, payment of official expenses of elections out of the public\r\nfunds, adult suffrage, proportional representation, triennial\r\nparliaments, second ballot, initiative and referendum.

It discloses the practical nature of the earlier Fabian\r\npolitical activities.]\r\n\r\n  COUNTY COUNCIL ELECTION: ADDRESS OF MR. SIDNEY WEBB, LL.B.\r\n      (LONDON UNIVERSITY), (PROGRESSIVE AND LABOR CANDIDATE)\r\n\r\n                                      Central Committee Rooms,\r\n                                        484, New Cross Road, S.E.\r\n\r\nELECTORS OF DEPTFORD,\r\n\r\nOn the nomination of a Joint Committee of Delegates of the Liberal and\r\nRadical Association, the Women's Liberal Association, the Working\r\nMen's Clubs, and leading Trade Unionists and Social Reformers in\r\nDeptford, I come forward as a Candidate for the County Council\r\nElection. I shall seek to lift the contest above any narrow partisan\r\nlines, and I ask for the support of all who are interested in the\r\nwell-being of the people.\r\n\r\n_The Point at Issue_\r\n\r\nFor much is at stake for London at this Election. Notwithstanding the\r\ncreation of the County Council, the ratepayers of the Metropolis are\r\nstill deprived of the ordinary powers of municipal self-government.\r\nThey have to bear needlessly heavy burdens for a very defective\r\nmanagement of their public affairs. The result is seen in the poverty,\r\nthe misery, and the intemperance that disgrace our city. A really\r\nProgressive County Council can do much (as the present Council has\r\nshown), both immediately to benefit the people of London, and also to\r\nwin for them genuine self-government. Do you wish your County Council\r\nto attempt nothing more for London than the old Metropolitan Board of\r\nWorks? This is, in effect, the Reactionary, or so-called \"Moderate,\"\r\nprogram. Or shall we make our County Council a mighty instrument of\r\nthe people's will for the social regeneration of this great city, and\r\nthe \"Government of London by London for London?\" That is what I stand\r\nfor.\r\n\r\n_Relief of the Taxpayer_\r\n\r\nBut the crushing burden of the occupier's rates must be reduced, not\r\nincreased. Even with the strictest economy the administration of a\r\ngrowing city must be a heavy burden. The County Council should have\r\npower to tax the ground landlord, who now pays no rates at all\r\ndirectly. Moreover, the rates must be equalized throughout London. Why\r\nshould the Deptford ratepayer have to pay nearly two shillings in the\r\npound more than the inhabitant of St. George's, Hanover Square? And we\r\nmust get at the unearned increment for the benefit of the people of\r\nLondon, who create it.\r\n\r\n_A Labor Program_\r\n\r\nI am in favor of Trade Union wages and an eight-hours day for all\r\npersons employed by the Council. I am dead against sub-contracting,\r\nand would like to see the Council itself the direct employer of all\r\nlabor.\r\n\r\n_Municipalization_\r\n\r\nAt present London pays an utterly unnecessary annual tribute, because,\r\nunlike other towns, it leaves its water supply, its gas-works, its\r\ntramways, its markets, and its docks in the hands of private\r\nspeculators. I am in favor of replacing private by Democratic public\r\nownership and management, as soon and as far as safely possible. It is\r\nespecially urgent to secure public control of the water supply, the\r\ntramways, and the docks. Moreover, London ought to manage its own\r\npolice, and all its open spaces.\r\n\r\n_The Condition of the Poor_\r\n\r\nBut the main object of all our endeavors must be to raise the standard\r\nof life of our poorer fellow-citizens, now crushed by the competitive\r\nstruggle. As one of the most urgent social reforms, especially in the\r\ninterests of Temperance, I urge the better housing of the people; the\r\nprovision, by the Council itself, of improved dwellings and common\r\nlodging-houses of the best possible types, and a strict enforcement of\r\nthe sanitary laws against the owners of slum property.\r\n\r\n_Local Questions_\r\n\r\nI believe in local attention to local grievances, and I should deem it\r\nmy duty, if elected, to look closely after Deptford interests,\r\nespecially with regard to the need for more open spaces, and the early\r\ncompletion of the new Thames tunnel.\r\n\r\nA more detailed account of my views may be found in my book, \"The\r\nLondon Programme,\" and other writings. I am a Londoner born and bred,\r\nand have made London questions the chief study of my life. I have had\r\nthirteen years' administrative experience in a Government office, a\r\nposition which I have resigned in order to give my whole time to\r\nLondon's service. With regard to my general opinions, it will be\r\nenough to say that I have long been an active member of the Fabian\r\nSociety, and of the Executive Committee of the London Liberal and\r\nRadical Union.\r\n\r\n                                                     SIDNEY WEBB.\r\n\r\n  4, Park Village East, Regent's Park, N.W.\r\n\r\nThe following meetings have already been arranged. Others will be\r\nannounced shortly.\r\n\r\n  February 11.--Lecture Hall, High Street, at 8 P.M.\r\n  February 25.--Lecture Hall High Street, at 8 P.M.\r\n  March 3.--New Cross Hall, Lewisham High Road, at 8 P.M.\r\n\r\n\r\nFABIAN ELECTION DODGER\r\n\r\n[The Fabians and other Socialists broke into London municipal politics\r\nunder the name \"Progressives.\" The following is one of their earliest\r\nelection dodgers.]\r\n\r\nCOUNTY COUNCIL ELECTION\r\n\r\n_Saturday, March 5, 1892_\r\n\r\nPart of the\r\n\r\nPROGRAM OF THE PROGRESSIVES\r\n\r\n_Rates._--Reduce the Occupiers' Rates one-half, by charging that\r\nportion upon the great Landlords, whose ground values are increased by\r\nevery improvement, and are now untaxed; and by a Municipal Death Duty.\r\n\r\n_Gas and Water._--Reduce the cost and improve the quality and quantity\r\nby new sources of supply, if the present Companies will not come to\r\nterms favorable to the Taxpayer.\r\n\r\n_City Companies._--Apply their whole Income of, say L500,000 (on leave\r\nobtained from the new Parliament), for the benefit of London. The\r\nRoyal Commission of 1884 stated that this income is virtually Public\r\nProperty. About L300,000 is now squandered each year among the members\r\nand their friends.\r\n\r\n_Homes for the Poor._--The Poor can all be comfortably housed, as in\r\nthe Municipal Dwellings of Glasgow and Liverpool, without extra cost\r\nto the Taxpayer, and the \"Doss-houses\" abolished.\r\n\r\n_Cheap Food._--By doing away with the Market Monopolies of the City\r\nCorporation and other private owners, Food can be lowered in price.\r\nGood food, especially fish, is now often destroyed or sold for manure\r\nto keep up the price.\r\n\r\n_Poor Man's Vote._--One-third of your Votes are lost. The Registration\r\nLaws must be thoroughly altered.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Debates, House of Lords, July, 31, 1885. The speech was privately\r\nprinted.\r\n\r\n[2] Debates, May 19, 1890.

ORIGIN OF THE WORD \"COLLECTIVISM\"\r\n\r\n\"This word, invented by Colins, came into common use toward the end of\r\nthe Empire. Bakunin used it in the congress at Berne in 1868, to\r\noppose it to the communistic regime of Cabet. An economist in 1869\r\ndesignated, under this name, the system under which production will be\r\nconfined to communes or parishes. The Socialists who opposed\r\nauthority, disciples of Bakunin, used the word for a long time to\r\ndesignate their doctrine. The section of Locle was one of the first to\r\nemploy it. But by and by, about 1878, the Marxists, partisans of the\r\nproletarian reign, used the word 'collectivism' to distinguish their\r\n'scientific Socialism,' of which term they were fond, from the\r\ncommunistic utopias of the older school, which they discovered. And\r\nthey gave to Bakunins the name Anarchists. These accepted the name,\r\ntaking care to write it with a hyphen, _an-archie_, as their master\r\nProudhon had done. They soon dropped the hyphen and accepted the word\r\nanarchy as a declaration of war against all things as they are.\"[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n2.

AMERICAN SOCIALIST PARTY PLATFORM\r\n\r\n[Adopted by National Convention May, 1908, and by Membership\r\nReferendum August 8th, 1908. Amended by Referendum September 7th,\r\n1909.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINCIPLES\r\n\r\nHuman life depends upon food, clothing, and shelter. Only with these\r\nassured are freedom, culture, and higher human development possible.\r\nTo produce food, clothing, or shelter, land and machinery are needed.\r\nLand alone does not satisfy human needs. Human labor creates machinery\r\nand applies it to the land for the production of raw materials and\r\nfood. Whoever has control of land and machinery controls human labor,\r\nand with it human life and liberty.\r\n\r\nTo-day the machinery and the land used for industrial purposes are\r\nowned by a rapidly decreasing minority. So long as machinery is simple\r\nand easily handled by one man, its owner cannot dominate the sources\r\nof life of others. But when machinery becomes more complex and\r\nexpensive, and requires for its effective operation the organized\r\neffort of many workers, its influence reaches over wide circles of\r\nlife. The owners of such machinery become the dominant class.\r\n\r\nIn proportion as the number of such machine owners compared to all\r\nother classes decreases, their power in the nation and in the world\r\nincreases. They bring ever larger masses of working people under their\r\ncontrol, reducing them to the point where muscle and brain are their\r\nonly productive property. Millions of formerly self-employing workers\r\nthus become the helpless wage slaves of the industrial masters.\r\n\r\nAs the economic power of the ruling class grows it becomes less useful\r\nin the life of the nation. All the useful work of the nation falls\r\nupon the shoulders of the class whose only property is its manual and\r\nmental labor power--the wage worker--or of the class who have but\r\nlittle land and little effective machinery outside of their labor\r\npower--the small traders and small farmers. The ruling minority is\r\nsteadily becoming useless and parasitic.\r\n\r\nA bitter struggle over the division of the products of labor is waged\r\nbetween the exploiting propertied classes on the one hand and the\r\nexploited propertyless class on the other. In this struggle the\r\nwage-working class cannot expect adequate relief from any reform of\r\nthe present order at the hands of the dominant class.\r\n\r\nThe wage workers are therefore the most determined and irreconcilable\r\nantagonists of the ruling class. They suffer most from the curse of\r\nclass rule. The fact that a few capitalists are permitted to control\r\nall the country's industrial resources and social tools for their\r\nindividual profit, and to make the production of the necessaries of\r\nlife the object of competitive private enterprise and speculation is\r\nat the bottom of all the social evils of our time.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the organization of trusts, pools, and combinations, the\r\ncapitalists are powerless to regulate production for social ends.\r\nIndustries are largely conducted in a planless manner. Through periods\r\nof feverish activity the strength and health of the workers are\r\nmercilessly used up, and during periods of enforced idleness the\r\nworkers are frequently reduced to starvation.\r\n\r\nThe climaxes of this system of production are the regularly recurring\r\nindustrial depressions and crises which paralyze the nation every\r\nfifteen or twenty years.\r\n\r\nThe capitalist class, in its mad race for profits, is bound to exploit\r\nthe workers to the very limit of their endurance and to sacrifice\r\ntheir physical, moral, and mental welfare to its own insatiable greed.\r\nCapitalism keeps the masses of workingmen in poverty, destitution,\r\nphysical exhaustion, and ignorance. It drags their wives from their\r\nhomes to the mill and factory. It snatches their children from the\r\nplaygrounds and schools and grinds their slender bodies and unformed\r\nminds into cold dollars. It disfigures, maims, and kills hundreds of\r\nthousands of workingmen annually in mines, on railroads, and in\r\nfactories. It drives millions of workers into the ranks of the\r\nunemployed and forces large numbers of them into beggary, vagrancy,\r\nand all forms of crime and vice.\r\n\r\nTo maintain their rule over their fellow-men, the capitalists must\r\nkeep in their pay all organs of the public powers, public mind, and\r\npublic conscience. They control the dominant parties and, through\r\nthem, the elected public officials. They select the executives, bribe\r\nthe legislatures, and corrupt the courts of justice. They own and\r\ncensor the press. They dominate the educational institutions. They own\r\nthe nation politically and intellectually just as they own it\r\nindustrially.\r\n\r\nThe struggle between wage workers and capitalists grows ever fiercer,\r\nand has now become the only vital issue before the American people.\r\nThe wage-working class, therefore, has the most direct interest in\r\nabolishing the capitalist system. But in abolishing the present\r\nsystem, the workingmen will free not only their own class, but also\r\nall other classes of modern society. The small farmer, who is to-day\r\nexploited by large capital more indirectly but not less effectively\r\nthan is the wage laborer; the small manufacturer and trader, who is\r\nengaged in a desperate and losing struggle for economic independence\r\nin the face of the all-conquering power of concentrated capital; and\r\neven the capitalist himself, who is the slave of his wealth rather\r\nthan its master. The struggle of the working class against the\r\ncapitalist class, while it is a class struggle, is thus at the same\r\ntime a struggle for the abolition of all classes and class privileges.\r\n\r\nThe private ownership of the land and means of production used for\r\nexploitation, is the rock upon which class rule is built; political\r\ngovernment is its indispensable instrument. The wage-workers cannot be\r\nfreed from exploitation without conquering the political power and\r\nsubstituting collective for private ownership of the land and means of\r\nproduction used for exploitation.\r\n\r\nThe basis for such transformation is rapidly developing within present\r\ncapitalist society. The factory system, with its complex machinery and\r\nminute division of labor, is rapidly destroying all vestiges of\r\nindividual production in manufacture. Modern production is already\r\nvery largely a collective and social process. The great trusts and\r\nmonopolies which have sprung up in recent years have organized the\r\nwork and management of the principal industries on a national scale,\r\nand have fitted them for collective use and operation.\r\n\r\nThere can be no absolute private title to land. All private titles,\r\nwhether called fee simple or otherwise, are and must be subordinate to\r\nthe public title. The Socialist Party strives to prevent land from\r\nbeing used for the purpose of exploitation and speculation. It demands\r\nthe collective possession, control, or management of land to whatever\r\nextent may be necessary to attain that end. It is not opposed to the\r\noccupation and possession of land by those using it in a useful and\r\nbona fide manner without exploitation.\r\n\r\nThe Socialist Party is primarily an economic and political movement.\r\nIt is not concerned with matters of religious belief.\r\n\r\nIn the struggle for freedom the interests of all modern workers are\r\nidentical. The struggle is not only national but international. It\r\nembraces the world and will be carried to ultimate victory by the\r\nunited workers of the world.\r\n\r\nTo unite the workers of the nation and their allies and sympathizers\r\nof all other classes to this end, is the mission of the Socialist\r\nParty. In this battle for freedom the Socialist Party does not strive\r\nto substitute working class rule for capitalist class rule, but by\r\nworking class victory, to free all humanity from class rule and to\r\nrealize the international brotherhood of man.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGRAM\r\n\r\nAs measures calculated to strengthen the working class in its fight\r\nfor the realization of this ultimate aim, and to increase its power of\r\nresistance against capitalist oppression, we advocate and pledge\r\nourselves and our elected officers to the following program:\r\n\r\n_General Demands_\r\n\r\n1. The immediate government relief for the unemployed workers by\r\nbuilding schools, by reforesting of cut-over and waste lands, by\r\nreclamation of arid tracts, and the building of canals, and by\r\nextending all other useful public works. All persons employed on such\r\nworks shall be employed directly by the government under an eight-hour\r\nwork-day and at the prevailing union wages. The government shall also\r\nloan money to states and municipalities without interest for the\r\npurpose of carrying on public works. It shall contribute to the funds\r\nof labor organizations for the purpose of assisting their unemployed\r\nmembers, and shall take such other measures within its power as will\r\nlessen the widespread misery of the workers caused by the misrule of\r\nthe capitalist class.\r\n\r\n2. The collective ownership of railroads, telegraphs, telephones,\r\nsteamboat lines, and all other means of social transportation and\r\ncommunication.\r\n\r\n3. The collective ownership of all industries which are organized on a\r\nnational scale and in which competition has virtually ceased to exist.\r\n\r\n4. The extension of the public domain to include mines, quarries, oil\r\nwells, forests, and water power.\r\n\r\n5. The scientific reforestation of timber lands, and the reclamation\r\nof swamp lands. The land so reforested or reclaimed to be permanently\r\nretained as a part of the public domain.\r\n\r\n6. The absolute freedom of press, speech, and assemblage.\r\n\r\n_Industrial Demands_\r\n\r\n7. The improvement of the industrial condition of the workers.\r\n\r\n(_a_) By shortening the workday in keeping with the increased\r\nproductiveness of machinery.\r\n\r\n(_b_) By securing to every worker a rest period of not less than a day\r\nand a half in each week.\r\n\r\n(_c_) By securing a more effective inspection of workshops and\r\nfactories.\r\n\r\n(_d_) By forbidding the employment of children under sixteen years of\r\nage.\r\n\r\n(_e_) By forbidding the interstate transportation of the products of\r\nchild labor, of convict labor, and of all uninspected factories.\r\n\r\n(_f_) By abolishing official charity and substituting in its place\r\ncompulsory insurance against unemployment, illness, accidents,\r\ninvalidism, old age, and death.\r\n\r\n_Political Demands_\r\n\r\n8. The extension of inheritance taxes, graduated in proportion to the\r\namount of the bequests and to the nearness of kin.\r\n\r\n9. A graduated income tax.\r\n\r\n10. Unrestricted and equal suffrage for men and women, and we pledge\r\nourselves to engage in an active campaign in that direction.\r\n\r\n11. The initiative and referendum, proportional representation, and\r\nthe right of recall.\r\n\r\n12. The abolition of the senate.\r\n\r\n13. The abolition of the power usurped by the supreme court of the\r\nUnited States to pass upon the constitutionality of legislation\r\nenacted by Congress. National laws to be repealed or abrogated only\r\nby act of Congress or by a referendum of the whole people.\r\n\r\n14. That the Constitution be made amendable by majority vote.\r\n\r\n15. The enactment of further measures for general education and for\r\nthe conservation of health. The bureau of education to be made a\r\ndepartment. The creation of a department of public health.\r\n\r\n16.
