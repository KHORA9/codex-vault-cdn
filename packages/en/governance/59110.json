When\r\napproached upon the subject several months ago he stated that he did not\r\nsuppose that he had accomplished enough to make a book, and it was only\r\nafter much persistent urging that he snatched the time from his busy\r\nlabors to correct and revise the original proofs of his Writings and\r\nSpeeches, and the argument he finally yielded to was that this work\r\nwould multiply his usefulness to the Socialist movement by as many\r\ncopies as may be distributed.\r\n\r\nThe _First American Revolution_ accomplished the overthrow of the rule\r\nof the English King in the Colonies, the extinction of all rule by\r\ninheritance, and the abolition of the proprietary charters to privileges\r\nin America which had been granted to favorites and legatees of the\r\nBritish Crown. The movement very early established the precedent of the\r\n“boycott” of “unfair” products when the Boston Tea Party by strategy\r\nboarded the ships of the English merchants and dumped their cargoes into\r\nthe sea. Nor was the period without its “undesirable” citizens, whose\r\nmemories loyal Americans delight to revere.\r\n\r\nThe Civil War, or the _Second American Revolution_, accomplished the\r\noverthrow of a fundamental principle in the Federal constitution as\r\ninterpreted by our highest judicial authority, in the Dred Scott\r\ndecision, and the abolition of a special form of slavery or property in\r\nblack human beings.\r\n\r\nThe Socialist Movement, or the _Third American Revolution_, has for its\r\naccomplishment the overthrow of private property in social wealth,\r\nmachinery and land, and the abolition of the Wage System, a form of\r\ngeneral slavery whereby men profit and grow fat out of the\r\nhunger-enforced labor, and hence out of the _lives_ of others.\r\n\r\nIt is no strain of words to say that in the extinction of Wage Slavery a\r\nmodified state of war even now obtains, and not so very modified at\r\nthat. We need not the tinsel and glitter of soldiery, nor the clash and\r\nclangor of arms to constitute war, but if we did, was it not but\r\nyesterday we heard the tread of troops in Colorado? And today, what is\r\nit we hear from the South but a fusilade upon the striking miners of\r\nAlabama? And tomorrow may we not hear the ripping, whirring sound the\r\nGatlings and Maxims make?\r\n\r\nBut aside from the open battle, a struggle far more brutal and inhuman,\r\nwages bitterly. The poor are warred upon, plundered and ravished. Our\r\nchildren famish and die at the machines of the Capitalist Class, and our\r\nwives, our widows and our daughters are torn from us and prostituted to\r\nuses abject and unmentionable. What more do we wish to make it war, and\r\nwhat more must we suffer?\r\n\r\nThis book, every line of which is a labor of love, is the property of\r\nThe Third Revolution, and as such is dedicated to the Wage Slaves of the\r\nworld who smart under the crack of the Hunger Whip.\r\n\r\n                                                           BRUCE ROGERS.\r\n\r\n _Girard, Kansas, August 1, 1908._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               BIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\n              “And there’s ’Gene Debs—a man ’at stands\r\n              And jest holds out in his two hands\r\n              As warm a heart as ever beat\r\n              Betwixt here and the Jedgment Seat!”\r\n                                  —_James Whitcomb Riley._\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Life of Eugene V. Debs\r\n\r\n                      _By Stephen Marion Reynolds_\r\n\r\nThe life of Eugene Victor Debs is so complicated and entwined with the\r\ndominant thought and action of his time, and he has so persistently,\r\nwith conscious purpose, touched and impressed it with primal vigor,\r\nintegrity and energy as will make a distinct and lasting work, not\r\nmerely upon the institutions of this country, but upon the future\r\nwelfare and development of all the peoples of the whole world.\r\n\r\nThis is an age of rare vitality, and of swiftly changing variety of\r\nevents.\r\n\r\nThere is growing every hour a new consciousness of the purposes of\r\nBEING, and there is such healthy, hearty, emphatic enthusiasm in it all\r\nas promises vast changes and uplift for humanity.\r\n\r\nThe converging streams of races are now neighborly and accessible;\r\nsuperstitions are being overthrown, and The People are being prepared;\r\nand,\r\n\r\n“When the materials are all prepared and ready, the architects shall\r\nappear. I swear to you the architects shall appear without fail. I swear\r\nto you they will understand you and justify you, O Peoples of the Earth!\r\nThe greatest among them shall be he who best knows you and encloses all\r\nand is faithful to all. He and the rest shall not forget you, they shall\r\nperceive that you are not an iota less than they. You shall be fully\r\nglorified in them.”\r\n\r\nBefore the battles for freedom, there have always appeared the writers,\r\nthe orators, the artists, and the singers; Rousseau, defining the “Logic\r\nof Liberty;” Tom Paine, calling for freedom from the king; and Patrick\r\nHenry, as large as his times, fearlessly announcing new doctrines to\r\ntake the places of decadent ideals; Lincoln and others pleading for the\r\nchattel slave; and in our time, multiplying voices crying aloud for\r\ncomplete freedom from wage-slavery, subtlest and meanest of all forms of\r\nhuman bondage.\r\n\r\nWe could not have had Appomattox without the conditions that made a\r\nLegree and Uncle Tom, and then came Harriet Beecher Stowe to reveal them\r\nto the world. We have had our Franklin, Jefferson, Lincoln, patriots,\r\nstatesmen, abreast the light of their times. Now we have “so-called\r\nstatesmen” who “talk” and “fiddle while Rome burns” and the army of the\r\nhungry and unemployed increases.\r\n\r\nIf we trace the poems and the orations we find the poets and the\r\norators, and back of them the conditions that filled their souls with\r\nsongs and eloquence and gave them power to utter the longings of the\r\nhuman heart. These poets and the orators, the true advocates that speak\r\nfor the people, seem to see from some high mountain a vision in the\r\nlonely hours, when their eyes are unbound, the Deity passing by, leaving\r\ncommands to be obeyed. These are those who are lifted above themselves\r\nas witnesses of the panorama of progress that the unseen hand unrolls;\r\nthus only can we account for sweet poems from bitter poets and words of\r\nlove from the hateful things in life. We then understand why Jesus drove\r\nthe money changers from the temple and said words of doom to the\r\ngeneration of vipers, and condemned in unmistakable words the greed for\r\nwealth.\r\n\r\nForemost among the architects of the present day, striving to build up\r\n“Industrial Democracy,” to emancipate man from economic servitude,\r\nappears the architect DEBS, knowing that the materials are ready and\r\nconsciously serving and building for his brothers, the intended ideal\r\n“Kingdom on Earth” for man to rule and dominate at last for himself\r\ninstead of his masters; bribes, menaces, the entreaties of his friends,\r\nall exhausted in the vain endeavor to move him from his firm and\r\nresolute will.\r\n\r\nNo one now attempts either.\r\n\r\nHe stands a towering rock of hope to the down-trodden and outcast\r\nworkers of the world.\r\n\r\nIn field, shop, mill, mine and factory, on the railroads and on the\r\nships of the seas his name is synonymous with devotion, love, sacrifice\r\nand unswerving integrity to the workers and their cause. Even the\r\noutcast rich admire “The Un-purchasable” and fear him with a reverence\r\nthat means much for their future, too, if they could but understand how\r\nall-inclusive are his labors to abolish classes and class struggles; for\r\nhe appears in this age pointing steadily and with unblinded vision to\r\nthe paths of industrial peace, plenty and human brotherhood.\r\n\r\nHe comes to bring to all that nameless power, that something which one\r\ninvoluntarily feels when in the presence, actual or ideal, of a genuine,\r\nstrong, true, vital man; such a man remains with those he meets and when\r\nhe departs leaves the permanent things of life and love with them and\r\nthey live forever in the imperishable marks and indications of uplifted\r\nmanhood.\r\n\r\nThe life of such a living, growing man cannot be written by even his\r\nmost intimate associates, for he is but an expression of the yearnings\r\nof the people, a voice of the proletariat, an embodiment of their needs.\r\n\r\nIf his physical life should end the task would be even more difficult.\r\nSo tangible and inspiringly vital is his complete physical, mental and\r\nspiritual presence. He has personally touched more lives than any other\r\nliving man.\r\n\r\nNo man has ever written more personal letters, throbbing with the\r\nascending song of life, clearly revealing the inner and spiritual\r\nprocesses of growth, than this comrade whose acknowledged conscious\r\nkinship to the manifestations of the universe does not end with the\r\nsponge on the rock, nor with the highest and most perfect forms of human\r\nand God-like life.\r\n\r\nWhoever has taken his magnetic hand has never forgotten the experience,\r\nbut has, for the time at least, ceased to note any serious or passing\r\ndisagreements and has been conscious of standing in the presence of a\r\nfearless searcher for Truth.\r\n\r\nThe man that comes crying a message in the wilderness and pointing to\r\nthe inevitable farther heights to which humanity must ascend, meets\r\nmisunderstanding, insult and rejection, but he is “The Darling of\r\nTomorrow,” when the heights are reached and the risen races run to mark\r\nthe fields of battle with the pathetic monuments of regret and of grief.\r\n\r\nSome day, when perhaps his letters are published, or when the stories of\r\nhis unselfish, loving life are known to the emancipated workers of the\r\nworld, their tears of joy and appreciation will wash out the shame of\r\ncontemporary ignorance and neglect.\r\n\r\nIt may be that he will be an exception and yet live to see the summits\r\nreached and “freedom for all” accomplished. This is not improbable, for\r\nhe is young and strong, growing and in step with the life-giving growth\r\nin intelligence of the workers. These are the days of quick growth and\r\ndevelopment. Electric wires on land and under the seas are everywhere.\r\nThe voice may be heard over the distant mountains and even without\r\nwires, the thoughts and feelings of mankind are transmitted. Moreover\r\nthere is something wonderful, as yet little understood, in the\r\nilluminating power of “Class Consciousness,” seeming to unify the\r\nintents and purposes of men and simplifying the hitherto strangling\r\nproblems of progress; compelling all forces to move resistlessly in the\r\nforward direction of freedom.\r\n\r\nEven obstruction and resistance are harnessed for advancement, plainly\r\nrevealing that there is an approaching change for better things, that\r\nmen recognize, even while they deny and resist.\r\n\r\nIt is not long ago since he was born—November 5, 1855—in a lowly\r\ncottage,[1] No. 447 North 4th Street, Terre Haute, Indiana. The\r\nDemocratic party had only begun its descent into decadence and vain\r\nprotest. The now missionless and moribund Republican party had not yet\r\nbeen born, but there were signs in the Republic of its begetting and\r\npregnancy. There were signs of impending crises in the affairs of\r\nmasters and chattels. The long-continued struggle for the abolition of\r\nchattel slavery, that began with the first chattel slaves in America,\r\nculminated in cruel fratricidal war while he was yet a tender child.\r\nThat period had a formative influence upon him, for there was noise and\r\nstrife and pain in all this section of Indiana; soldiers encamped and\r\nwounded men in hospitals and prisons, and fierce debates and sounds of\r\nvictory and of defeat.\r\n\r\nHis father, Jean Daniel Debs, and mother, Marguerite Betterich Debs,\r\nnatives of Alsace, had many stories to tell to the children at the\r\nfireside of France and her joys, sunshine, shadows and sorrows. The\r\nfather was intimately acquainted with all of French history and had a\r\nmost complete library of her history. He was upright, loving and\r\nlovable; the mother wise and gentle; both intimate companions of the\r\nchildren, and were familiarly called “Dandy” and “Daisy.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                             FAMILY RECORD.\r\n\r\n                                 BORN.\r\n\r\nJean Daniel Debs was born at Colmar, Alsace, France, December 4, 1820.\r\n\r\n                           ON A SAILING SHIP.\r\n\r\nJean Daniel Debs left Colmar for America November 10, 1848, and arrived\r\nat New York January 20, 1849.\r\n\r\nMarguerite Marie Betterich left Colmar for America August 7, 1849, and\r\narrived at New York September 11, 1849.\r\n\r\n                                MARRIED.\r\n\r\nJean Daniel Debs and Marguerite Marie Betterich were married in New York\r\nCity September 13, 1849.\r\n\r\n                                LOCATED.\r\n\r\nThey left New York for Cincinnati, Ohio, September 30, 1850; left\r\nCincinnati for Terre Haute, Indiana, May 20, 1851; left Terre Haute\r\nMarch 24, 1854, returning to New York and locating in Brooklyn\r\n(Williamsburg, L. I.); left Brooklyn September 25, same year, returning\r\nto Terre Haute and locating there permanently.\r\n\r\n                               CHILDREN.\r\n\r\nTen children were born to them, of these six are living.\r\n\r\n[2]Theodore, the only brother, well known as an ardent Socialist and\r\ntireless worker for the cause, has always been and is very close and\r\nvery dear and helpful to “Gene” in all his work. There are four sisters\r\nand only a few years’ difference in the ages of all of them; they make\r\nthe ideal family group. The father did not long survive the mother, she\r\ndeparting this life April 29, 1906, and he following her November 27,\r\n1906.\r\n\r\nThis family grew up where there were no jealousies and where love was\r\nnot only felt, but expressed in acts of service and of sacrifice.\r\nSincere affection gives insight, intuition, understanding, and equips\r\nfor service and shuts out greed and degrading ambition for place and\r\npower.\r\n\r\nThe stories of his childhood and few school years are replete with human\r\ninterest and would take much space to fully record. From the beginning,\r\nthe law of his life was work, but he was equally zealous in all the\r\nplays and sports of childhood. There were many children and much to do\r\nto support them, so his school years were short and ended with his\r\ngraduation, with credit, from the Old Seminary School in Terre Haute,\r\nwhere the Indiana State Normal School now stands. In May, 1870, he began\r\nto work for the Terre Haute & Indianapolis Railroad Company (now\r\nPennsylvania System) first in the shops and later as a locomotive\r\nfireman.\r\n\r\nHe worked continuously until October, 1874. The mother could not conceal\r\nthe tears of fear in her eyes when, with lantern in hand, he kissed her\r\nto go out over the unballasted prairie railroad. So when he was offered\r\na position by Herman Hulman, of the Hulman & Cox grocery house at Terre\r\nHaute, he accepted and filled all requirements until September, 1879,\r\nwhen he was elected city clerk. He served in that office four years. He\r\nhad joined the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen when it was first\r\norganized at Terre Haute. He had organized the Brotherhood of Railroad\r\nBrakemen, now the Brotherhood of Railway Trainmen; had helped to\r\norganize the Switchmen’s Mutual Aid Association, the Brotherhood of\r\nRailway Carmen, the Order of Railway Telegraphers and other labor\r\nunions, and at the Buffalo convention, in 1878, he was made associate\r\neditor of the Firemen’s Magazine, and in July, 1880, was appointed Grand\r\nSecretary and Treasurer, and Editor and Manager of the magazine, serving\r\nin the former capacity until February, 1893, and in the latter capacity\r\nuntil September, 1894.\r\n\r\nAt the time he took charge of the affairs of the Brotherhood of\r\nLocomotive Firemen the order had only 60 lodges and $6,000 debt. In a\r\nshort time he had been able to add 226 lodges and had wiped out the\r\ndebt. No such demonstration of love and pathetic regret had ever been\r\nknown in a national gathering of citizens as that which was shown to him\r\nwhen the order, after having exhausted all efforts of persuasion,\r\nreluctantly accepted his resignation from these offices of the order.\r\nWhen he resigned from these offices he was receiving $4,000 per year. It\r\nwas at the Cincinnati convention, 1892, he tendered his resignation,\r\nwhich was unanimously refused; he was unanimously re-elected to all the\r\noffices previously held. He again tendered his resignation and insisted\r\nupon its acceptance, with the frank statement that “organization” should\r\nbe broad enough to embrace all the workers, and that he desired and\r\nproposed to give all his energy to the building up of such an\r\norganization. The convention unanimously voted to give him, as a mark of\r\nappreciation, $2,000 for a trip to Europe, for rest and enjoyment; this\r\nhe declined. Finally, after unyielding insistence, his resignation from\r\nthe several offices was accepted, taking effect as above stated.\r\n\r\nWith the assistance of a few others he organized at Chicago, in June,\r\n1893, The American Railway Union, and his salary was fixed at $75 per\r\nmonth. During the last two years of the organization’s existence he drew\r\nno salary at all. His further motives for his action in resigning from\r\nthe Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen to organize the A. R. U. cannot be\r\nbetter told than in his own words uttered by him at the time:\r\n\r\n“I do this because it pleases me, and there is nothing I would not do,\r\nso far as human effort goes, to advance any movement designed to reach\r\nand rescue perishing humanity. I have a heart for others and that is why\r\nI am in this work. When I see suffering about me, I myself suffer, and\r\nso when I put forth my efforts to relieve others, I am simply working\r\nfor myself. I do not consider that I have made any sacrifice whatever;\r\nno man does, unless he violates his conscience.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                         GREAT NORTHERN STRIKE.\r\n\r\nApril 16, 1894, a circular letter was issued to the members of the A. R.\r\nU. containing a scale of wages paid on the Great Northern Railroad. This\r\nscale showed that the Great Northern Railroad never did pay such wages\r\nas other Pacific grand continental lines. According to this scale train\r\ndespatchers were receiving $80 per month; freight conductors, $78;\r\nfreight brakemen, $42 to $53; engineers, in some cases, only $2.80 per\r\nday; inspectors, $35 per month; operators, $37.50 to $41.50;\r\nroundhousemen, a dollar a day; trackmen, a dollar a day, and truckmen, a\r\ndollar a day. The cheapest board in Butte, Montana, was $26 a month.\r\n\r\nThe Great Northern sent out a cipher dispatch to remove all spirited men\r\nand to gather together all available men to take their place. The A. R.\r\nU. gained knowledge of this step on the part of the Great Northern and\r\ndecided to call the employes to quit on very short notice. Enclosing\r\nthis circular letter issued from the Butte City, Montana, headquarters\r\nof the A. R. U., the directors closed their appeal to the men in the\r\nfollowing words:\r\n\r\n“We need your financial and moral support everywhere. It is the greatest\r\nstrike the world has even seen. Give us your moral and financial support\r\nthrough the general office at Chicago. Act quickly. See if we cannot\r\nbreak the chains that are being forged to reduce us, not only to\r\nslavery, but to starvation.”\r\n\r\nBefore ordering the strike the following letter, dated April 13, was\r\nsent out:\r\n\r\n  “To C. W. Case, Gen’l Manager of the Great Northern Railway:\r\n\r\n  “Sir: I am instructed by your employes to say that unless the scale\r\n  of wages and rules of classes of employes that were in effect prior\r\n  to the first cut made August 1, 1893, are restored and switchmen at\r\n  Great Falls and Helena receive the same pay and schedules as at\r\n  Butte and the management agrees to meet the representatives of the\r\n  employes at Minot not later than ten days hence and formulate\r\n  schedules accordingly, all classes of employes will quit work at\r\n  12:00 o’clock noon this 13th day of April.”\r\n\r\nThe notice was only six hours and the employes had no apologies to make\r\nin this respect. No reply being received before the hour set, the order\r\nto strike was given. Mr. Hill, on receiving information of the walk-out\r\nof his employes, issued a notice expressing the wish that faithful\r\nemployes would remain, making general promises of promotion usual in\r\nsuch cases. The A. R. U. held revival meetings at all points on the line\r\nof the Great Northern and membership increased by the thousands.\r\n\r\nOn the 22d of April Mr. Debs and Mr. Howard addressed a large gathering\r\nof railroad men at St. Paul and added 225 members to the A. R. U. Beaten\r\nat every point, Mr. Hill called for a conference. The purpose of that\r\nconference on Mr. Hill’s part was to close up somebody’s eye. His\r\nbusiness success has been largely bottomed on that characteristic. Those\r\nacquainted with Mr. Debs had no fear of the result. Mr. Hill wound up\r\nthe lengthy conference by proposing arbitration. This was refused by Mr.\r\nDebs. Mr. Debs saying at the conclusion of the conference these words:\r\n\r\n“Let me say that we do not accept the proposition. Efforts have been\r\nmade ever since this trouble started to divide the organization and make\r\ntrouble between the Union and the Brotherhoods. I understand such to be\r\nthe policy of this company. Now if the other organizations represent the\r\nmen, let them set your wheels turning. Our men will not go back to work.\r\nMy idea is that in raising the question of representation you have\r\nsought to evade the issue. We presented the terms upon which we would go\r\nto work. I am authorized to say that we will settle on these terms and\r\non no others. This grievance is a universal grievance and all the men\r\nare united in this action. It will be to no avail to attempt to divide\r\nus into factions. If wages are not restored you can no longer have the\r\nservice of the men. For the past week we have restrained the men from\r\nleaving your employ. Now, understand me that I am too much a gentleman\r\nto make a threat and I do not mean this as anything but a plain\r\nstatement of fact, but if there is no adjustment, those men will\r\nwithdraw from your service in a body. They are convinced that their\r\ndemand is a just one. If their request is not complied with,” continued\r\nMr. Debs in slow and measured tones, “they will, without regard to\r\nconsequences, continue this struggle on the lines already laid down and\r\nfight it out with all the means at their command within the limits of\r\nthe law. We understand your position; you understand ours. We will not\r\nwithdraw from this conference. We shall be in the city several days and\r\nshall be glad to receive any further communications from you.”\r\n\r\nMr. Hill was not slow in understanding and the world knows the facts\r\nabout this great victory, won with peaceful methods.\r\n\r\n\r\n     MR. DEBS’ RETURN HOME AFTER THE A. R. U. VICTORY MAY 3, 1894.\r\n\r\n                                       (_From the Terre Haute Express._)\r\n\r\nMid soul-stirring music and the joyous shouts from the lips of 4,000 of\r\nhis friends and neighbors, men, women and children, Eugene V. Debs,\r\nPresident of the American Railway Union, was welcomed home last night,\r\ncare-worn and weary, from his 18 days’ struggle for victory in the Great\r\nNorthern strike:\r\n\r\nMr. Debs marched with the people, refusing to enter the carriage\r\nprovided, and in the park near the Terre Haute House he delivered the\r\nfollowing address:\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen, my friends and neighbors: From the depths of my heart I\r\nappreciate and thank you for this demonstration of your confidence and\r\nrespect. I had not the remotest idea that on my return to my native city\r\nsuch a magnificent demonstration awaited me.\r\n\r\n“As a rose-bud yields to the tender influences of a May shower, just so\r\ndoes my heart open to receive the expressions of gratitude and esteem\r\nfrom you, my friends and neighbors. I have, as you are aware, just\r\nreturned from the Northwest, the scene of trouble on one of the greatest\r\nrailroad systems in the country. The contest on the Great Northern\r\nsystem has no parallel in the history of railroad trouble. From the hour\r\nthe strike commenced the men were united; they stood shoulder to\r\nshoulder—engineers, firemen, brakemen, conductors, switchmen, and even\r\nthe trackmen and freight handlers, who are generally first to suffer,\r\nstood up as one man and asserted their manhood.\r\n\r\n“One of the remarkable features, very remarkable, in the contest, was\r\nthe good feeling which prevailed during the 18 days of the strike, and\r\nthe good feeling lasted during the trying and anxious hours of\r\narbitration. I am glad, my friends, to be able to say to you tonight,\r\nthat in all those 18 days there was, from one end of the Great Northern\r\nroad to the other, not a single drop of human blood spilled. The\r\nAmerican spirit of fair play was uppermost in the minds of the manly men\r\nwho were involved in the trouble, and their fight for wages was\r\nconducted without rowdyism or lawlessness. The reduction on the Great\r\nNorthern Railway was without cause. In resisting it, the employes met\r\nsolidly organized capital face to face, and man to man, and for 18 days\r\nnot a pound of freight was moved and not a wheel turned, with the\r\nexception of mail trains. As a result of this unification, this show of\r\nmanliness and courage on the part of the employes, they gained 97½ per\r\ncent of what they claimed as their rights. The arbitration of the\r\ndifferences was entrusted into the hands of 14 representative business\r\nmen of the Twin Cities, with Chas. Pillsbury, the merchant miller\r\nprince, as chairman. The preliminaries leading up to that memorable\r\nmeeting of arbitration covered many weary hours, but once in session and\r\nfacing the great question of wages of thousands of men, these 14 men,\r\nall of whom were men of capital and employers of labor, reached a\r\nverdict in one hour, a verdict for the employes, by which $146,000 more\r\nmoney will monthly be distributed among the deserving wage-earners than\r\nwould have been had they not stood up for what they knew to be justly\r\ntheirs.\r\n\r\n“My glory, my friends, consists in the gladness which I know will be\r\nbrought into the little cottage homes of the humble trackmen among the\r\nhills in the West. I can almost see the looks of gratitude on the faces\r\nof these men’s wives and little children. In all my life I have never\r\nfelt so highly honored as I did when leaving St. Paul on my way home. As\r\nour train pulled out of the yards the tokens of esteem, which I prize\r\nfar more highly than all others, was in seeing the old trackmen, men\r\nwhose frames were bent with years of grinding toil, who receive the\r\npittance of from 80 cents to $1 a day, leaning on their shovels and\r\nlifting their hats to me in appreciation of my humble assistance in a\r\ncause which they believed had resulted in a betterment of their\r\nmiserable existence.\r\n\r\n“The American Railway Union does not believe in force except in the\r\nmatter of education. It believes that when agreements and schedules are\r\nsigned there should be harmony between all. It believes and will work to\r\nthe end of bringing the employer and employe in closer touch. An era of\r\ncloser relationship between capital and labor, I believe, is dawning,\r\none which I feel will place organized labor on a higher standard. When\r\nemployer and employed can thoroughly respect each other, I believe, will\r\nstrikes be a thing of the past. For as Mr. Hill, President of the Great\r\nNorthern, said to me at the conclusion of the arbitration conference,\r\n‘You have fought a good fight and I respect you,’ and I answered, ‘Mr.\r\nHill, if this shall be your policy I will give you my word of honor that\r\nin future your road will be engaged in no more such trouble as has just\r\nterminated.’ This strike is not without its fruit and will result in\r\nmuch good all along the line. I hope to see the time when there will be\r\nmutual justice between employer and employes. It is said the chasm\r\nbetween capital and labor is widening, but I do not believe it. If\r\nanything, it is narrowing down and I hope to see the day when there will\r\nbe none.\r\n\r\n“What has occurred tonight seems to me like a dream, a revelation. You\r\nare all too generous, honorable, magnanimous, and my heart rises to my\r\nlips in receiving this demonstration from you, my neighbors, from the\r\npeople of my home, where I was born and have grown from childhood to\r\nmanhood. A look into the recesses of my heart only can show you the\r\ngratitude I have no words to express. I can only assure you my eternal\r\nfriendship and loyalty. With my heart on my lips I thank you, my\r\nfriends—honorable men, lovely women, and little children. Had I the\r\neloquence of an Ingersoll I could not express the happiness, the long\r\nlife and success I wish you one and all. Once more, with gratitude\r\ntrembling upon my lips, I bid you all good fortune.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE PULLMAN STRIKE.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1894, the great Pullman strike was fought and won, but victory\r\nwas turned into defeat by the Federal administration using the courts\r\nand the soldiers to imprison the leaders and crush the strike. The\r\nrailroad corporations then resolved to annihilate the A. R. U. Debs was\r\nindicted for various crimes, the railroad corporations demanding that he\r\nbe prosecuted for conspiracy, treason and murder. Many predicted that he\r\nwould be hanged. He was imprisoned several times and served six months\r\nin Woodstock Jail for contempt of court. While serving at Woodstock, he\r\nwas taken daily to Chicago, a distance of 55 miles, under escort of two\r\ndeputy sheriffs, where he was being tried for conspiracy and other\r\ncrimes, but when the prosecution learned that Debs and his attorneys\r\nwere in possession of the secret proceedings of the Railroads’ General\r\nManagers’ Association and that they had a number of witnesses to testify\r\nas to who had committed the crimes charged to the strikers, the trial\r\nwas abruptly ended on the plea that a juror had suddenly been taken\r\nsick. No effort has ever been made to impanel another jury and so far as\r\nthe records show, the juror is still sick, and the cases ended by\r\nevasion and subterfuge on the part of the Railroad Corporations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  DEBS’ BIRTHPLACE, TERRE HAUTE\r\n\r\n  (See Page 4)\r\n]\r\n\r\nDebs was kept 18 months in the jurisdiction of the court by\r\npostponements and various pretexts, calculated to prevent him from\r\nre-organizing the A. R. U., and when finally released, the railroad\r\ncorporations put detectives on his track and for two years they followed\r\nhim, and whenever he organized the men they were discharged, as were\r\nmany who even recognized him or who were suspected of having any\r\nsympathy with his work or for him personally. He saw that it was vain\r\nand hopeless to reorganize the A. R. U. and that all the influence the\r\ncorporations could combine were opposing it.\r\n\r\n\r\n            SOCIALISM DAWNING UPON THE LABOR LEADER’S MIND.\r\n\r\nThe Great Northern strike, the strike of the A. R. U. in sympathy with\r\nthe suffering workers at Pullman, the injunction and the proceedings for\r\ncontempt, the imprisonment of Mr. Debs and his associate officers for\r\ncontempt of court, the trial for conspiracy and many other events which\r\nwill hereinafter be set forth in greater detail, developed the vision of\r\nthe Labor Leader and turned his mind in the direction of political\r\naction to solve the wrongs of labor.\r\n\r\nIn a letter to the “Coming Nation,” now the “Appeal to Reason,” November\r\n23, 1895, Mr. Debs first advocated the establishment of the co-operative\r\ncommonwealth by the exercise of the ballot.\r\n\r\n“Liberty, be it known, is for those only who dare to strike the blow to\r\nsecure and retain the priceless boon. It has been written that ‘Love of\r\nLiberty with life is given,’ and that ‘life without liberty is a\r\ncontinuous curse,’ and that ‘an hour of liberty is worth an eternity of\r\nbondage.’ It would be an easy task to link together gilded periods\r\nextolling liberty until the mind weary with delight, becomes oblivious\r\nof the fact that while dreaming of security the blessings we magnified\r\nhad, one by one, and little by little, disappeared, emphasizing the\r\ntruth of the maxim that ‘eternal vigilance is the price of liberty.’\r\n\r\n“Is it worth while to iterate that all men are created free and that\r\nslavery and bondage are in contravention of the Creator’s decree and\r\nhave their origin in man’s depravity? If liberty is a birthright which\r\nhas been wrested from the weak by the strong or has been placed in peril\r\nby those who were commissioned to guard it as Gheber priests watch the\r\nsacred fires they worship, what is to be done? Leaving all other\r\nnations, kindred and tongues out of the question, what is the duty of\r\nAmericans? Above all, what is the duty of American workingmen whose\r\nliberties have been placed in peril? They are not hereditary bondsmen;\r\ntheir fathers were free-born—their sovereignty none denied and their\r\nchildren yet have the ballot. It has been called ‘a weapon that executes\r\na free man’s will as lightning does the will of God.’ It is a metaphor\r\npregnant with life and truth. There is nothing in our government it can\r\nnot remove or amend. It can make and unmake presidents and congresses\r\nand courts. It can abolish unjust laws and consign to eternal odium and\r\noblivion unjust judges, strip from them their robes and gowns and send\r\nthem forth unclean as lepers to bear the burden of merited obloquy as\r\nCain with the mark of a murderer. It can sweep our trusts, syndicates,\r\ncorporations, monopolies and every other abnormal development of the\r\nmoney power designed to abridge the liberties of workingmen and enslave\r\nthem by the degradation incident to poverty and enforced idleness as\r\ncyclones scatter the leaves of our forest. The ballot can do all this\r\nand more. It can give our civilization its crowning glory—the\r\nco-operative commonwealth. To the unified hosts of American workmen fate\r\nhas committed the charge of rescuing American liberties from the grasp\r\nof the vandal horde that have placed them in peril, by seizing the\r\nballot and wielding it to re-gain the priceless heritage and to preserve\r\nand transmit it, without scar or blemish to the generations yet to come.\r\n\r\n                 “Snatch from the ashes of their sires,\r\n                 The emblems of their former fires;\r\n                 And he who in the strife expires,\r\n                 Will add to theirs a name of fear,\r\n                 That Tyranny shall quake to hear.”\r\n\r\nMarch 22, 1899, a conference was held at 39 West 26th Street, New York,\r\nattended by a large number of representatives of scattered organizations\r\nhaving altruistic tendencies, with a view of organizing a new political\r\nparty. Mr. Debs attended this conference and in reply to an address made\r\nby the chairman of the meeting, Mr. Debs said:\r\n\r\n“I wish to be candid with the gentlemen present. I am a Socialist. I am\r\none who believes in the co-operative ownership, not only of the means of\r\nproduction and distribution, but of this planet. Such an amalgamation as\r\nthis proposed here cannot succeed, and if it did succeed it would mean\r\nthe sacrifice of principle. I have tried to gather together men of\r\nvarious beliefs. I have tried the step at a time policy, I have been an\r\nopportunist, but after years of experience and work and agitation,\r\ngentlemen, I have finally landed on the bedrock of Socialism and from\r\nthat I will not move.”\r\n\r\nDr. W. S. Rainsford, rector of St. George’s Episcopal Church, replied,\r\nsaying:\r\n\r\n“All great reforms have been the result of compromise. History proves\r\nthat beyond question. I realize, as well as anybody else, the need of\r\nradical action, but I also believe that men of kindred sympathies must\r\nsacrifice personal opinions and stand together for the common good of\r\nall the people, hence I am happy to confess that in these matters I am\r\nan opportunist.”\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Dr. Henry Frank said his experience told him George M. Pullman\r\nwas summoned to give some testimony, that all the great men of today\r\nwere Socialists, “the statesmen, the writers, the thinkers, and even the\r\nfashionably gowned and the jeweled members of the so-called better\r\nclasses in their hearts are Socialists.” It was not a question of\r\nprinciple as much as a question of program that must be decided upon.\r\n\r\nMr. Debs, who seemed alone in his uncompromising opinions, replied that\r\nthe results of the compromises spoken of are wage-slavery, such as the\r\nworld never saw. He would rather have 10,000 Socialists with their faces\r\nto the storm and their teeth set, who knew what they wanted and who\r\nstood firm, than a million men of varying opinions held loosely together\r\nin the hope of making a step at a time. He said he did not care if\r\nvictory could be given to such men tomorrow. They are not sufficiently\r\nwell organized and until that was done all hope of lasting results were\r\nfutile.\r\n\r\nAt the evening session Mr. Debs declined to vote on the resolution\r\noffered to hold the conference at Buffalo, reiterating his belief that\r\nthe proposed conference will come to naught unless it comes out for\r\nbed-rock uncompromising Socialism.\r\n\r\nThe labor movement received its origin from low wages and over-work. Of\r\nthe millions who are employed, only a few obtain fair wages. These\r\nconstitute the “_aristocracy of labor_.” They care nothing for the great\r\nmajority whose wages are so low that under most favorable circumstances\r\nthey are only able to barely live. The labor movement then has two\r\nsupreme purposes in view,—first, the advance of wages all along the\r\nline; second, the reduction of the hours constituting a day’s work.\r\nThese purposes are fundamental, eliminate them and the labor movement\r\ndisappears and labor organizations forthwith collapse. We hear much for\r\nand against labor in politics. Why so? Simply because laws have been\r\nenacted by which wages can be forced down and men compelled to work more\r\nhours than is good for soul and body. Who made these unjust laws? The\r\nold parties, Democrat and Republican, are both culpable. Does labor\r\ndesire to continue such a policy? The universal answer is “no.” Then why\r\nnot vote for a party honestly committed to a policy which would enact\r\njust laws and honestly administer them? No rational reply can be made.\r\nThe labor movement is based upon a few simple propositions,—more wages\r\nand a less number of hours for a day’s work, which would inevitably\r\nresult in better conditions.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fact that during Mr. Debs’ imprisonment in Woodstock\r\nJail, he had read many books on the philosophy of Socialism, including\r\nCarl Marx’s great work, handed to him by Victor Berger, who visited him\r\nfor the purpose of interesting him in this great question, and in spite\r\nof the fact that he advocated the union of workingmen at the ballot box,\r\nhe did not see at that time any way of incorporating social economics\r\ninto political expression. He was still a democrat, fighting in the\r\ndark, but with the scales gradually falling from his intellectual eyes.\r\nHe supported the candidacy of William Jennings Bryan in the campaign of\r\n1896, believing, as millions did, that Mr. Bryan put man above the\r\ndollar, and that Mr. Bryan would truly represent the democratic\r\ninstincts of the people and do all in his power to undo the wrongs\r\nheaped upon labor by Grover Cleveland. He did not advocate Mr. Bryan’s\r\nelection in any revengeful spirit against Mr. Cleveland, but in the hope\r\nthat this fresh, young orator from the West would do all he could to\r\nemancipate the people from the thraldom of the money power.\r\n\r\n\r\n   MR. DEBS REFERS TO THE INJUNCTION IN HIS SPEECH THE EVENING OF HIS\r\n               RETURN TO TERRE HAUTE, NOVEMBER 23, 1895.\r\n\r\n“In our cases at Chicago an injunction was issued at a time when the\r\nAmerican Railway Union had its great struggle for human rights and they\r\nwere triumphant in restraining myself and colleagues from doing what we\r\nnever intended to do and never did do; and then we were put in jail for\r\nnot doing it. When that injunction was served on me, to show that I\r\nacted in good faith, I went to two of the best constitutional lawyers in\r\nthe City of Chicago and said, ‘What rights, if any, have I under this\r\ninjunction? I am a law-abiding citizen; I want to do what is right. I\r\nwant you to examine this injunction and then advise me what to do.’ They\r\nexamined the injunction. They said, ‘Proceed just as you have been\r\ndoing. You are not committing any violence; you are not advising\r\nviolence, but you are trying to do everything in your power to restrain\r\nmen from the commission of crime or violating the law.’ I followed their\r\nadvice and got six months for it. (Laughter and applause.)\r\n\r\n“What does Judge Lyman Trumbull say upon that subject? Judge Trumbull is\r\none of the most eminent jurists the country has produced. He served\r\nsixteen years in the United States Senate; he was chairman of the Senate\r\nCommittee on Judiciary; he was on the Supreme Bench of the State of\r\nIllinois; he has held all of the high offices but he is a poor man.\r\nThere is not a scar nor a blemish upon his escutcheon. No one ever\r\nimpugned his integrity. What does he say about this subject? To use his\r\nexact language he says: ‘The decision carried to its logical conclusion\r\nmeans that any federal judge can imprison any citizen at his own will.\r\nIf this be true, it is judicial despotism, pure and simple, whatever you\r\nmay choose to call it.’ When the trials were in progress at Chicago Mr.\r\nGeo. M. Pullman was summoned to give some testimony. Mr. Pullman\r\nattached his car to the New York train and went East, and in some way\r\nthe papers got hold of the matter and made some publication about it and\r\nthe judge said that Mr. Pullman would be dealt with drastically. In a\r\nfew days Mr. Pullman returned and he went into chambers, made a few\r\npersonal explanations and that is the last we heard about it. Had it\r\nbeen myself, I would have to go to jail. That is the difference. Only a\r\nlittle while ago Judge Henford cited Henry C. Payne, of the Northern\r\nPacific, to appear before him to answer certain charges, and he went to\r\nEurope and is there yet. Will he go to jail on his return? Of course\r\nnot. The reason suggests itself. If it were a railroad striker he would\r\nbe in Woodstock instead of Berlin.\r\n\r\n“Governor Altgeld, in many respects the greatest governor in the United\r\nStates, says: ‘The precedent has now been established and any Federal\r\njudge can now enjoin any citizen from doing anything and then put him in\r\njail.’ Now what is an injunction? It has all of the force and vital\r\neffect of a law, but it is not a law, in and by the representatives of\r\nthe people; it is not a law signed by a president or by a governor. It\r\nis simply the wish and will of the judge. A judge issues an injunction;\r\nserves it upon his intended victim. The next day he is arrested. He is\r\nbrought into the presence of the same judge. Sentence is pronounced upon\r\nhim by the same judge, who constitutes the judge and court and jury and\r\nhe goes to jail and he has no right of appeal. Under this injunctional\r\nprocess the plain provisions of the constitution have been disregarded.\r\nThe right of trial by jury has been abrogated, and this at the behest of\r\nthe money power of the country. What is the effect upon the workingmen\r\nand especially railway employes to bind them to their task? The\r\ngovernment goes into partnership with a corporation. The workingmen are\r\nintimidated; if there is a reduction of wages they submit; if unjust\r\nconditions are imposed they are silent. And what is the tendency? To\r\ndemoralize, to degrade workingmen until they have reached the very dead\r\nline of degradation. And how does it happen and why does it happen that\r\ncorporations are never restrained? Are they absolutely law-abiding? Are\r\nthey always right? Do they never transgress the law or is it because the\r\nFederal judges are their creatures? Certain it is that the united voice\r\nof labor in this country would be insufficient to name a Federal judge.\r\nIf all the common people united and asked for the appointment of a\r\nFederal judge their voice would not be heeded any more than if it were\r\nthe chirp of a cricket. Money talks. Yes, money talks. And I have no\r\nhesitancy in declaring that money has even invaded, or the influence,\r\nthat power conferred by money, has invaded the Supreme Court and left\r\nthat august tribunal reeking with more stench than Coleridge discovered\r\nin Cologne and left all the people wondering how it was ever to be\r\ndeodorized. There is something wrong in this country; the judicial nets\r\nare so adjusted as to catch the minnows and let the whales slip through\r\nand the Federal judge is as far removed from the common people as if he\r\ninhabited another planet. As Boyle O’Reilly would say:\r\n\r\n            “His pulse, if you felt it, throbbed apart\r\n            From the throbbing pulse of the people’s heart.”\r\n\r\nOn January 1, 1897, Debs issued a circular to the members of the A. R.\r\nU. entitled “Present Conditions and Future Duties,” in which he reviewed\r\nthe political, industrial and economic conditions and came out boldly\r\nfor Socialism. Among other things he said:\r\n\r\n“The issue is Socialism vs. Capitalism. I am for Socialism because I am\r\nfor humanity. We have been cursed with the reign of gold long enough.\r\nMoney constitutes no proper basis of civilization. The time has come to\r\nregenerate society—we are on the eve of a universal change.”\r\n\r\nWhen the A. R. U. held its convention at Chicago in June, 1897, he and\r\nits members favored political action, and the Social Democratic party\r\nwas organized June 21, 1897, and this was the beginning of what is now\r\nknown as the Socialist party of America.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       GOVERNMENT BY INJUNCTION.\r\n\r\nThe year 1894 marks a great historical change in the attitude of\r\nlaborers towards government, for it was during that memorable strike\r\nthat the now famous injunction was used to cripple the efforts of the\r\nworkers to improve their condition by the lawful methods of the general\r\nstrike. The late and now great (?) Cleveland, in spite of the\r\ntraditional fealty of the Democratic party to state sovereignty, over\r\nthe protests of Governor Altgeld of Illinois, who declared that the\r\nstate was amply able to protect life and property in its territory, sent\r\nFederal troops into Chicago and disorder followed, and the strike was\r\nlost and, as stated, its leader thrown into prison.\r\n\r\nGovernment by injunction is today the “slogan” of both old parties, and\r\ntheir hypocritical utterances as to this issue are convincing the\r\nAmerican working people that with the army as a police force government\r\nby corporations has taken the place of government by the people and the\r\nfarmers exploited by the packers’ and elevator and railroad interests,\r\nthe miner snubbed everywhere by the coal barons and the vast and\r\nincreasing army of the unemployed, young and outcast old men are now\r\nthinking in terms of political strike, rather than in terms of boycott\r\nand idle protest.\r\n\r\nThe hours of work are now short enough to the workers, and far too short\r\nto provide food, shelter and clothing for themselves and families in the\r\nmidst of industrial stagnation, caused by exhausting the purchasing\r\npower of the producers of wealth through the blind greed of those who\r\nclaim the right to take unto themselves the earth and its exhaustless\r\nresources for abundantly supplying the needs of all.\r\n\r\nDuring the eventful years from 1894 to this epoch-making year 1908, the\r\ntwo old parties have come into closer resemblance, until now Mr. Bryan\r\nis found claiming that Mr. Roosevelt has adopted his ideas. He is not so\r\ninsistent, however, on this point as he was a year ago, when he admitted\r\nthat there had been great additions to the gold supply, hence more\r\nmoney, hence more work, and hence more prosperity. He is now assuming to\r\nbe more critical of the present government policies of his Republican\r\nfriends and promises to bring the depressed workers back into more\r\nabundant pastures of the clover kind. It is not strange that the dormant\r\nminds of the people are being awakened, for the workers are no longer so\r\neasily bewildered by the strange talk of “full dinner buckets” and\r\n“abundant money.” On all these matters Debs has been heard by hundreds\r\nof thousands and his words of prophecy have been more than fulfilled and\r\nin every argument he based every prediction upon the iron law of\r\nindustrial production and distribution of wealth. While he has, during\r\nall these years advocated the ballot, he has never forgotten the\r\nunanswerable reasons for down-trodden workingmen using the outworn\r\nweapons of the strike and all its weapons of boycott and persuasion, but\r\nthe attitude had been that of the wise understanding and not of the\r\nblind approval of the blind leading the blind.\r\n\r\nWhen the A. R. U. went to pieces it had legal obligations for more than\r\n$40,000. There was no personal obligation resting upon Mr. Debs in this\r\nmatter, and yet, for years he wrote and lectured and helped to pay off\r\nthe last penny of the debt, and to this day there is no unpaid\r\nobligation of the defunct A. R. U.\r\n\r\n\r\n              TRIAL FOR CONSPIRACY TAKEN FROM THE RECORDS.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, July 10, 1894, a special grand jury was impaneled in the\r\nUnited States District Court of Northern Illinois. Judge Grosscup\r\ncharged the jury as to what is insurrection, conspiracy, etc., and the\r\njury retired to consider such evidence as might be brought before it\r\nconcerning the conduct of the American Railway Union strike. Edwin\r\nWalker, counsel for the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railroad, had been\r\nappointed by Olney, Attorney-General under Grover Cleveland, special\r\ncounsel to assist in this prosecution, and he and Attorney Wright, of\r\nthe Rock Island Railroad, were in attendance. One witness was\r\nexamined—E. M. Mulford, of the Western Union Telegraph Company—and\r\ncontrary to all precedent, produced for the jurors copies of the\r\ntelegrams which had been sent out from and received at the American\r\nRailway Union headquarters since the strike had begun. With no further\r\npreliminaries, the jury promptly indicted four American Railway Union\r\nofficials, and within ten minutes after Judge Grosscup received the\r\nindictments four warrants were issued, and within an hour Eugene V.\r\nDebs, President; George W. Howard, Vice-President; Sylvester Kelliher,\r\nSecretary, and L. W. Rogers, Director and Editor of the “Railway Times,”\r\nwere under arrest. The official headquarters were raided. All books,\r\nblanks, papers and correspondence of the Union were seized, as well as\r\nall President Debs’ private mail. The officers returned Mr. Debs’\r\nprivate mail the next morning by order of the court.\r\n\r\nOn July 17 the four were again arrested for contempt of court on\r\npetition of Special Counsel Walker, alleging violating of the\r\nrestraining injunction which had been issued by Judges Grosscup and\r\nWoods. In this restraining order persuasion was charged as a crime and\r\nunion labor was given notice that it could not use persuasion in order\r\nto better their conditions. The defendants refused to give bail and the\r\nfour slept in Cook County jail, where they remained until Wednesday,\r\nJuly 23, when their attorneys moved to dismiss the contempt proceedings,\r\nas they were virtually for the same offense charged in the indictments\r\nand that no man could be tried twice for the same offense. Their motion\r\nwas denied. The defendants pleaded for trial by jury and this was\r\nrefused. Further hearing of the case was then postponed to accommodate\r\nJudge Woods until September 5. Later a supplemental information was\r\nfiled in the contempt case to include the directors of the American\r\nRailway Union.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        AMERICAN RAILWAY UNION.\r\n\r\nIn the A. R. U. there were originally sixty-nine persons named in the\r\nomnibus indictments for conspiracy to obstruct the United States mail.\r\nBefore the trial the government counsel entered a nolle pros. as to a\r\nnumber of the persons indicted, leaving the number January 8, 1895,\r\nforty-five. There were seven indictments against Debs, Howard and\r\nRogers, and three each against the full Board of Directors of the A. R.\r\nU. Debs, Howard, Kelliher and Rogers were first indicted with James\r\nMervin for conspiring to obstruct a mail train on the Rock Island\r\nRailroad, and were arrested by the Marshall and placed in the County\r\nJail until the court admitted them to bail. The four leaders were under\r\n$25,000 bonds in all of the conspiracy indictments except the omnibus\r\nindictment. The defendant directors were represented by S. S. Gregory\r\nand C. S. Darrow, and Jno. J. Hannahan was represented by Thos. W.\r\nHarper, of Terre Haute. Edwin Walker, District Attorney General J. C.\r\nBlack and his predecessor, T. E. Milchrist, represented the government.\r\n\r\nMr. Gregory, addressing the court, said:\r\n\r\n“I stand ready to prove that one of the attorneys, who is here to\r\nrepresent the United States, has been retained as counsel for one of the\r\nrailroads interested in this case,—the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul. We\r\nobject to his sitting in this case.”\r\n\r\nMr. Walker said: “Part of this statement is true and part is not true.”\r\n\r\nMr. Gregory asked that Mr. Walker be interrogated, but the court\r\ndeclined to interfere.\r\n\r\nOf the twelve jurors chosen, eight were farmers, one an insurance agent,\r\none a real estate dealer, one a dealer in agricultural implements, and\r\none a painting and decorating contractor. The government was very\r\ncareful to exclude workingmen from the jury.\r\n\r\nMr. Milchrist, in his opening speech for the government, said:\r\n\r\n“Men have a right to strike.”\r\n\r\nMr. Darrow replied in his opening address:\r\n\r\n“If this is so, it ends this case, for no one but the evil genius that\r\ndirects this prosecution believes these men did anything else. There is\r\na statute which makes the obstruction of a mail car punishable by a fine\r\nof $100, yet no one had heard of the men who actually obstructed the\r\nmails during the strike being indicted under that statute. In order to\r\nmake felons of honest men, who never had a criminal thought, they passed\r\nby that state to seize on one that makes conspiracy to obstruct the\r\nmails a crime punishable by imprisonment in the penitentiary. To hound\r\nthese men into the penitentiary is their purpose, yet they call this\r\nrespect for law. Conspiracy from the days of tyranny in England down to\r\nthe day the General Managers’ Association used it as a club has been the\r\nfavorite weapon of every tyrant. It is an effort to punish the crime of\r\nthought. If the government does not, we shall try to get the General\r\nManagers here to tell what they know about it. The evidence will show\r\nthat all these defendants did was in behalf of the employes of that man\r\nwhose name is odious wherever men have a drop of human blood—Mr.\r\nPullman. No man or set of men or newspaper ever undertook to defend Mr.\r\nPullman except the General Managers’ Association, and their defense\r\ngives added proof of his infamy. These defendants published to all the\r\nworld what they were doing, and in the midst of a wide-spread strike\r\nthey were never so busy but that they found time to counsel against\r\nviolence. For this they are brought into a court by an organization\r\nwhich uses the government as a cloak to conceal its infamous purposes.”\r\n\r\nIt was shown in the evidence from hundreds of telegrams read to the\r\njury, all signed by Eugene V. Debs, that he counseled abstaining from\r\nall forms of violence and keeping within their rights as workingmen.\r\nThere were more than 9,000 telegrams sent out during the strike and all\r\ntelegrams that were considered of any value to the prosecution were\r\nproduced by Edward M. Mulford, manager of the Western Union Company. It\r\nwas shown by the defense that Mr. Wicks, vice-president of the Pullman\r\nCompany, attended the emergency meetings of the General Managers’\r\nAssociation in June. Why he was permitted to be present was not\r\nexplained by the prosecution.\r\n\r\nMr. B. Thomas, president of the Chicago & Western Indiana Railway\r\nCompany, was put upon the stand and testified in regard to the General\r\nManagers’ Association,—that it was organized April 20, 1886; that the\r\npurposes were to consider matters relating to railway management and\r\nwages, and that the Association had acted as a unit in resisting\r\npetitions for the increase of wages. The witness further testified that\r\nagencies had been established by the Association for the purpose of\r\nhiring new men to take the places of strikers, and that the expenses of\r\nthe Association were apportioned among the several roads composing it.\r\n\r\nMr. Darrow read from the minutes of a meeting of the General Managers’\r\nAssociation August 31, 1893, that a general combination of the railroad\r\nmanagers throughout the United States was desirable and a committee of\r\nfive men was appointed to take steps to carry out this idea. It was also\r\ndeveloped that the object of this combination was to regulate wages and\r\nmake them uniform throughout the country.\r\n\r\nFrom the minutes of the meeting of September 21, 1893, Mr. Darrow read a\r\nresolution to the effect that however much it was to be regretted, a\r\nreduction in the wages of railway employes generally had become\r\nabsolutely necessary.\r\n\r\nAfter the examination of the General Managers, Mr. Debs, president of\r\nthe A. R. U., was called to the stand, February 6, 1895.\r\n\r\nIn this evidence Mr. Debs, in reply to questions, gave a brief history\r\nof his life from November 3, 1855. He testified that more than\r\n$4,000,000 passed through his hands during his term of office as\r\nsecretary and treasurer of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen. He\r\ngave a history of the labor development among railway employes up to the\r\ntime of his resignation from the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen, and\r\nhis uniting with the American Railway Union in 1892. He stated the\r\nobject of the American Railway Union to be “A unification of _ALL_\r\nrailroad employes for their mutual benefit and protection.” Being asked\r\nwhat led to the formation of the Union and to his conviction that it was\r\nnecessary to form such an organization, Mr. Debs replied, that the\r\nconcentration of the smaller railroads into the larger in this country\r\nhad been going on for the last 20 years, the smaller roads being\r\ngradually reduced into the larger; that the wages had been gradually\r\nreduced, and in substance stated that the concentration of the railroads\r\nlogically compelled a closer union among railway workers, as they could\r\nnot accomplish anything by striking along craft lines.\r\n\r\nHe further testified that at the time of the strike on the Great\r\nNorthern Road there were about 150,000 members of the A. R. U.; that the\r\nstrike commenced April 13, 1894, and lasted eighteen days, culminating\r\nin complete victory, peaceful and orderly, and the strike was called\r\noff.\r\n\r\nHe testified that he first learned of the Pullman trouble when he\r\nreturned from St. Paul, May 5, 1894, and first learned of the strike at\r\nPullman on May 11. He was asked if the strike was brought on in any way\r\nby his advice, and Mr. Debs replied: “No, it was done contrary to my\r\nadvice. I first went to Pullman,” said Mr. Debs in his evidence, “on the\r\n14th of May after the strike occurred, and stayed there part of the day\r\nand an evening. I went again on May 18.” Mr. Debs stated he investigated\r\nconditions at Pullman by inquiry among the employes and their families\r\nand also from other independent sources, including the Rev. Carwardine,\r\nwho had been preaching in Pullman for three years. “The result of the\r\ninvestigation,” said Mr. Debs, “was that I came to the conclusion that\r\nthe Pullman Company was in the wrong; that wages had been unjustifiably\r\nreduced below the living point and that rents were much too high in\r\ncomparison with what was charged for the same class of dwellings\r\nelsewhere.” He was not permitted by the court to testify as to the\r\nconditions existing among the people at Pullman. Being asked as to the\r\nconvention of the A. R. U. held in Chicago, he stated that it was held\r\nJune 12, 1894, and that 425 delegates were present from nearly all the\r\nstates in the Union, and that newspaper reporters were present at all\r\nmeetings of the convention except one executive session, which was\r\ncalled to consider the financial affairs of the Order and nothing else;\r\nthat telegrams sent and received by the A. R. U. were subjected to the\r\nexamination of members of the press; that nothing was concealed. He said\r\nthe convention voted $2,000 of the funds for the Relief Committee at\r\nPullman and the money was paid over to them; that the convention voted a\r\nlevy of 10 cents a day per capita; that that was not collected because\r\nof the strike that followed.\r\n\r\nMr. Debs stated that there were speeches made at the convention by\r\nseveral on the situation at Pullman and that subsequently a motion was\r\nmade to declare a boycott against the Pullman cars at once and that\r\nrailway men should not haul them. Mr. Debs said that as chairman of the\r\nconvention he declined to entertain this motion, on the ground that it\r\nwas a very important matter which should not be acted upon hastily or\r\nuntil every means of effecting an amicable settlement had been\r\nexhausted; that he suggested that a committee be appointed to try to\r\nsettle the matter by arbitration and avert a strike and that such\r\ncommittee was appointed; that the committee reported Saturday, June 16;\r\nthat the Pullman Company positively declined to confer with any\r\nrepresentatives of the American Railway Union and would confer only with\r\ntheir own employes as individuals. Another committee, composed entirely\r\nof Pullman employes, visited Mr. Wicks, vice-president of the Pullman\r\nCompany, and reported that he said the company had nothing to arbitrate,\r\nand that he regarded the strikers in the position of “men on the\r\nsidewalk, so far as their relations with the company were concerned.”\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Mr. Carwardine, on the following Wednesday, addressed the\r\nconvention, told of his experience during his stay of three years in\r\nPullman, and particularly of his knowledge of the condition and\r\nsurroundings of the people there. He said they were on the point of\r\nstarvation and appealed to the convention in the name of God and\r\nhumanity to act. He closed by saying that whatever was done must be done\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\nMr. Debs then told of a resolution to declare a boycott on the Pullman\r\ncars and the appointment of a committee to notify Mr. Wicks that unless\r\nhe agreed to arbitrate the matter, the boycott would go into effect at\r\nnoon June 26. This committee reported that Mr. Wicks still refused and\r\npreparations were then made to put the resolution into effect. He was\r\nasked if he or anyone else counseled violence or violation of law; he\r\nanswered that nothing of the sort was advised by himself or any of the\r\nother speakers. He said, “Never in all my life have I broken the law or\r\nadvised others to do so.” His testimony was listened to with marked\r\ninterest by the jury. After Mr. Debs’ testimony had been completed\r\nDeputy Marshal Jones reported to the court that he had made diligent\r\nsearch for Mr. Pullman at his office and couldn’t find him. He said that\r\n“nobody appears to know the exact whereabouts of that gentleman.”\r\nJohnson, who occupies the honorable office of preventing distasteful\r\ncallers from having access to his chief by demanding that they shall\r\nfirst be properly accredited to him by a piece of pasteboard, was\r\nbrought to court and testified that he took Mr. Jones’ card in as usual\r\nand that Mr. Sweet, Pullman’s private secretary, carried it to the\r\nmagnate’s room and returned, saying his employer was not in. He\r\ntestified in a straightforward manner that Mr. Pullman walked into his\r\noffice in the usual manner at 10:30 in the morning and on his way passed\r\nthrough the reception room. After that, the factotum declares he never\r\nsaw the head of the Palace Car Company.\r\n\r\n\r\n    FURTHER EVIDENCE AS TO CONDITIONS AT PULLMAN, BY JENNIE CURTIS.\r\n\r\nShe stated that the Pullman employes were indebted to Mr. Pullman\r\n$70,000 for rent at the time of the strike; that their wages had been\r\ninsufficient to enable them to live and pay their living expenses. Mr.\r\nDebs was re-called and asked if he sent out an official order June 28,\r\nand he said he did; that the official order was given to the city\r\nnewspapers and the Associated Press over his own signature. Mr. Debs\r\nread the manifesto, which had been referred to, and after counseling\r\npeaceful methods in all cases and a strict compliance with the laws, the\r\nmanifesto concluded with these words:\r\n\r\n“A man who will violate law is against the interests of labor.”\r\n\r\nMore than 150 telegrams were read to the jury, signed by Mr. Debs,\r\ncounseling peaceful methods and standing together if they wished to win.\r\n\r\nThe government attorneys did all they could to prevent such evidence\r\nbeing introduced. The government attorneys asked Mr. Debs what wages he\r\nwas getting as a fireman in 1875. He said, “I began at $1 a night.” He\r\nsaid, “I was afterwards paid by the mile.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  DEBS’ PRESENT HOME IN TERRE HAUTE\r\n]\r\n\r\nAttorney Walker for the prosecution then asked Mr. Debs the following\r\nquestions:\r\n\r\n“Q. Your salary as president of the American Railway Union of $3,000\r\nstill continues, does it not?\r\n\r\n“A. No, sir; I cut it off myself last September.\r\n\r\n“Q. The purpose of your Union was to get the control of all the railroad\r\nemployes in the hands of the American Railway Union, was it not?\r\n\r\n“A. Yes, sir, under the limitations of the Constitution and By-Laws.”\r\n\r\nMr. Debs was then asked if the Great Northern strike was a peaceful\r\nstrike. He replied it was,—that no intimidation was used; that the\r\ncompany made no attempt to bring in new men; that there were no troops\r\ncalled out. The government attorney then asked:\r\n\r\n“Q. You simply took possession of the road and held it?\r\n\r\n“A. No, sir; we simply went home and stayed there.\r\n\r\n“Q. There was no excitement?\r\n\r\n“A. None whatever.”\r\n\r\nMr. Debs was then asked the meaning of the word “strike.” He replied as\r\nfollows: “A strike is a stoppage of work at a given time by men acting\r\nin concert in order to redress some real or imaginary grievance.”\r\n\r\nThe government attorney then said: “Mr. Debs, will you define the\r\nmeaning of the word ‘scab?’” He replied as follows: “A scab in labor\r\nunions means the same as a traitor to his country. It means a man who\r\nbetrays his fellowmen by taking their places when they go on a strike\r\nfor principle. It does not apply to non-union men who refuse to quit\r\nwork.”\r\n\r\nFebruary 8 it was again reported to the court that Mr. Pullman could not\r\nbe found. Each day there was reported an additional disappearance of\r\nemployes of the Pullman Company; first, Mr. Pullman was reported gone,\r\nthen his private secretary disappears, and the court issues subpœnas\r\nagainst the great man’s stenographers, whose services are so valuable\r\nthat they are generally in attendance upon the head of the company\r\nthroughout the entire year, but no sooner are the subpœnas issued and\r\nthe officials are sent to serve them than the individual for whom they\r\nare intended are not to be found. The judge looked very grave and when\r\nhe heard the news of these disappearances of witnesses that the\r\ndefendants were trying to bring into court and the attorneys for the\r\ndefense failing to get these employes, issued subpoenas for others\r\naround the Pullman buildings.\r\n\r\nOn convening court Judge Grosscup announced that “owing to the sickness\r\nof a juror and the certificate of his physician he will not be able to\r\nget out for two or three days. I think it will be necessary to adjourn\r\nthe further taking of testimony in this case.” General Black, for the\r\nprosecution, said he thought it would be possible to arrange that the\r\nproceedings be continued with eleven jurors. Judge Grosscup thought such\r\nproceedings would not be valid. Mr. Darrow, for the defense, proposed\r\nthat the place of the sick juror should be filled and the case proceed\r\nafter the evidence had been read over to the new juror. Long argument\r\nwas then held and on Tuesday morning, the 12th of February, 1895, Judge\r\nGrosscup discharged the jury, and continued the Debs case to the first\r\nMonday in May. This was done over the objection of the defendants. They\r\nwere confident of an acquittal at the hands of the jury and their\r\nconfidence was justified by both words and actions of the jurors after\r\nthey were discharged. As soon as court adjourned they shook hands with\r\nJudge Grosscup and then made a break for the defendant and their\r\nattorneys. For half an hour they held a regular levee, shaking hands and\r\nchatting most cordially with Mr. Debs and the other defendants. Counsel\r\nfor the government were rather left to pose as wall-flowers. Mr. Debs\r\nwas told by more than one juror that on the notions he held when he went\r\ninto the jury box, five years in the penitentiary might not have been\r\nunexpected, but that since hearing the testimony, his notions were very\r\ndifferent. Mr. Walker, attorney for the government, who was nearest the\r\njury, remarked to one of them that now he was free to do so, by reason\r\nof their being discharged, he would like to shake hands with them. “We\r\nwant to shake hands with the judge first,” was the reply he got. Most of\r\nthe jurors shook hands with the judge, then hastened to find Mr. Debs,\r\nthe defendants, and their attorneys. One or two jurors shook hands with\r\nthe prosecution attorneys, but there was a decided heartiness in the\r\ndemeanor of the jurors toward the defense. Mr. Debs and all of the\r\ndefendants have ever since believed that the jurors were fair, candid\r\nand able and they did everything possible to have the case brought to a\r\nconclusion by the jury which had been selected and accepted.\r\n\r\nThe sudden termination of the Debs case left the question of whether Mr.\r\nPullman was in contempt or not in the shape of unfinished business. Mr.\r\nPullman afterwards said that he had had the grip, had aches in all parts\r\nof his body; his nerves were shattered and his heart affected, he had a\r\nbad taste in his mouth and felt a disinclination to engage in any\r\nphysical exertion; made up his mind to go East; thought the trip would\r\ndo him good; had his private car arranged, attached it to a train which\r\nwas to leave February 5. He admitted that he was in the Pullman offices,\r\nas stated before.\r\n\r\nMr. Pullman has never been able, nor will he ever be able to make any\r\nother explanation of his evasion of the law and his failure to do\r\njustice to himself and the accused in this historic case.\r\n\r\nIt is now known that the General Managers’ Association, disguised in the\r\nUnited States lion’s skin, was the prosecution and that it had but one\r\npurpose and that was to break up and annihilate the American Railway\r\nUnion, by sending the leaders to the penitentiary, not only to get them\r\nout of the way, but to warn other agitators not to interfere with the\r\nGeneral Managers’ Association’s right to do what they pleased with the\r\nwages and hours of their employes and with the rates and charges for\r\ntransporting the products of the field, the mine, the farm and the\r\nfactory, or the persons of the people as they pleased. If Debs had fled\r\non the day of the trial, as Mr. Pullman did, we would not yet have heard\r\nthe last of such cowardly conduct.\r\n\r\nThe case was not called up in May, nor has it ever been called up, nor\r\nhave the indictments ever been withdrawn. The Railway Managers knew whom\r\nthey could call upon to enable them to carry out their purposes and they\r\ncalled upon the late Grover Cleveland and in violation of every\r\nprinciple of state sovereignty, he sent the U. S. troops into Chicago to\r\ndo ordinary police duty and crush out the right of the oppressed workers\r\nto peacefully obtain a redress of wrongs. The principal actors in this\r\nhuman drama have changed positions and roles. The accused are remembered\r\nand idealized by the people and their accusers are as though they never\r\nhad been, except for the paltry parts they played.\r\n\r\nIt was almost impossible for the American people to learn about the\r\ntruth in this great case, because the railroads controlled then, as they\r\ndo now, the press. Bribery, falsehood, untruthful news items were spread\r\nall over the country and many good people still believe that Debs was\r\nthe monster of wrong-doing and that Pullman was a magnate whose rights\r\nas an employer had been unlawfully invaded.\r\n\r\n\r\n    SOME EDITORIALS IN CHICAGO PAPERS APPEARING DURING THE TRIAL FOR\r\n                              CONSPIRACY.\r\n\r\nEditorial in the _Evening Press_, November 23, 1895, entitled: “The\r\nLiberation of Debs”:\r\n\r\n“In the face of facts developed yesterday, it is idle to say that Eugene\r\nV. Debs has lost the esteem of the masses. No such demonstration as was\r\nmade in his honor yesterday and last night has been seen in this city in\r\nmany years, if at all. Had he been the victorious soldier returned fresh\r\nfrom conquests instead of a convict liberated from prison, his welcome\r\ncould not have been more spontaneous, enthusiastic, sympathetic. Whether\r\nEugene V. Debs merited imprisonment in the Woodstock jail; whether Judge\r\nWoods in adjudging him in contempt of court did or did not debauch the\r\nconstitution, are questions now under consideration. Rightfully or\r\nwrongfully, legally or illegally, Debs was sent to prison and after\r\nserving his sentence to the last hour, was discharged yesterday.\r\n\r\n“Do all men who transgress the law go to prison? Is the judicial and\r\nmilitary machinery of the United States set in motion every time a law\r\nis violated? Is the interference with interstate communication a greater\r\ncrime than open, flagrant, overriding of the will of the people in\r\nstatute expressed by wealthy individuals and corporations? These\r\nquestions may be discussed and should be discussed by every man and\r\nwoman and child who hold law and justice in esteem.\r\n\r\n“Not many months ago members of the cabinet, senators and congressmen\r\nconspired with representatives of the Sugar Trust to rob the people of\r\nmillions of dollars. A secretary admitted before a congressional\r\ninvestigation committee that he introduced a representative of this\r\ngigantic sugar monopoly to law makers who would aid his cause. A senator\r\nconfessed to having made money by dealing in sugar stocks when the sugar\r\nschedule was under consideration in the senate. The President of the\r\nSugar Trust boldly declared his concern made a practice of giving\r\nhundreds of thousands of dollars to political parties to insure\r\nfavorable legislation. In each instance law was transgressed, yet not a\r\nfederal soldier was ordered out and not a man went to prison.\r\n\r\n“The influence of the Standard Oil Company on courts and legislatures\r\nand congress is notorious. Judges have been corrupted and law makers\r\nbought by the mighty concern and not a soldier was ordered to arms or\r\nanother prison cell occupied. Steam and street railway companies have\r\nbribed assemblies and councils and stolen public highways and lake\r\nfronts and the soldier boys slept on in their fortresses and the prison\r\ntailor had no calls for striped suits.\r\n\r\n“The day must never come when there is no law. But it must come when\r\nJustice will rip the bandage from her eyes and see and call for the\r\nHavemeyers and the Standard Oil magnates and other transgressors of law,\r\nas well as for the Debses.”\r\n\r\nAnd now, July 22, 1908, as I write, the famous decision imposing a fine\r\nof $29,240,000 on the Standard Oil Company for violation of the laws of\r\nthe United States is reversed by the same Judge Grosscup who handed the\r\nlemons to the striking workers and their leaders in 1894. Do you see?\r\n\r\n\r\n                  “COULD NOT SERVE GEORGE M. PULLMAN.”\r\n\r\n“At the beginning of the afternoon session the attention of the court\r\nwas called to the difficulty experienced in securing the attendance of\r\nGeorge M. Pullman as a witness. Deputy Marshal Jones told the court he\r\nhad not been able to get personal service on Mr. Pullman, though he was\r\nsatisfied he was in the city. He had been to Mr. Pullman’s office and\r\nthe elevator boy had told him that Mr. Pullman was in his private room,\r\nbut when he announced his business to Mr. Pullman’s private secretary,\r\nthe latter went to the sanctum of the sleeping car magnate and returned\r\nwith the information that Mr. Pullman was not in, but was wintering in\r\nSaint Augustine, Fla.\r\n\r\n“The Court looked very grave when this announcement was made and\r\nremarked that he would see the attorney for the defense in his chambers\r\nafter court adjourned.”—_Chicago Times_, Feb. 7, 1895.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n                        “ROOM FOR THE MAGNATE.”\r\n\r\n“The Court then adjourned on account of the absence of George M.\r\nPullman, for whom a subpœna had been issued.\r\n\r\n“Of course, adjourn a court to suit the convenience of George M.\r\nPullman, who has grown decidedly since last July. He is now a magnate of\r\nthe first class in the Republican party, and the Court in having\r\npresumed to subpœna him at all ought to have accompanied the service of\r\nthe process with ample apologies for venturing, even in the name of the\r\nUnited States, to trespass upon the valuable time of a gentleman\r\ndistinguished not only in his own, his native land, but also throughout\r\ncivilization as the proprietor of perambulating lodging houses and\r\nstand-up whisky bars.\r\n\r\n“Of course, a court ought to adjourn in order to consult the convenience\r\nof Mr. Pullman. Mr. Pullman himself had regard for his own convenience\r\nwhen, during all the trouble of last July, he remained in the East,\r\nwhile the militia and the constabulary force of Cook County guarded his\r\nproperty so effectively that not even a blade of grass was trampled\r\ndown, not even a window was broken in all the establishments of the town\r\nthat bears his name.\r\n\r\n“He rose superior to the dictates of common humanity last July, and why\r\nshould the dictate of a court affect him in February?\r\n\r\n“It is absolutely essential that Mr. Pullman should be heard; why should\r\nnot his Honor adjourn his court and bring its officers and the jury and\r\nthe whole entourage to Mr. Pullman’s palatial residence and let him have\r\nhis say while he sips his chocolate?\r\n\r\n“Is it not a fault of the republic that the masses do not sufficiently\r\nconsider the dignity of the magnates? They are superior beings. Ordinary\r\nprocesses of law are made for ordinary individuals. Magnate Pullman has\r\nall the dignity of a Chinese mandarin, and he ought not to be approached\r\nsave with the obsequiousness of a subject of the Celestial Empire\r\nprostrating himself at the foot-stool of Chinese majesty.”—Editorial,\r\n_Chicago Times_, February 7, 1895.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             “THE MAGNATE.”\r\n\r\n“Magnate Pullman is still missing. His whereabouts seem to give no\r\nconcern to his immediate attendants, but Judge Grosscup of the United\r\nStates Court is showing some anxiety to learn where he is and why it is\r\nthat he has not been served with a process calling him into court. An\r\nexamination of Magnate Pullman’s colored doorkeeper made by the Judge\r\npersonally disclosed that he saw the magnate enter his office Monday at\r\n10:30 o’clock, an hour after a deputy marshal called, but he has since\r\nmysteriously disappeared, and the marshal has been unable to locate him.\r\n\r\n“Why this assumption of right to inquire into the personal movements of\r\nso great a man as Mr. Pullman? Ought we not, rather, anxiously unite in\r\nefforts to ascertain whether he is entirely safe, for if Magnate Pullman\r\nwere to disappear into thin air, it is doubtful if the world would\r\ncontinue to revolve upon its axis and make its usual diurnal revolution.\r\nHuman laws are made for the mass of mankind. Why should Magnate Pullman,\r\nwho does not belong to the mass, but is a being apart, constructed of\r\nsuperior clay, be subjected to any such belittling regulation? Magnate\r\nPullman keeps more bar-rooms in more states in the Union than any grog\r\nshop seller and employs more male chamber-maids than any other magnate\r\nin the bed-house business.\r\n\r\n“The _Tribune_ finds excuses for the magnate. It says: ‘It is not\r\nstrange that he should be unwilling to go on the stand and be questioned\r\nby Mr. Darrow, Mr. Geeting and the other lawyers for the defense. It is\r\nnot pleasant for a person who is at the head of a great corporation, who\r\nhas many subordinates and no superiors, and who is in the habit of\r\ngiving orders instead of answering questions, to be interrogated by\r\npersons who are unfriendly to him, and who may put disagreeable\r\ninquiries which he has to reply to civilly.’\r\n\r\n“That’s it. Mr. Pullman is superior to the law. Like the king, he can do\r\nno wrong, and no processes can lie against him. The _Tribune_, however,\r\nwe are bound to say, weakens a little, for it adds: ‘Nevertheless, it is\r\nthe duty of all men to appear in court when they are wanted there. The\r\nsubpœna does not discriminate between persons. Furthermore, those who\r\nneed the defense of the law the most, should be the promptest and the\r\nmost willing to submit themselves to the occasional unpleasantness of\r\nthe law, and should try to show that they believe all men are equal\r\nbefore the law.’\r\n\r\n“How presumptuous to suggest such a thing to Magnate Pullman, who does\r\nnot believe that all men are equal before the law. The _Tribune_ further\r\nventures to say that Mr. Pullman ‘should have faced the music like a\r\nman.’\r\n\r\n“There was some music here last June and July. It was music that never\r\nshould have been played if Magnate Pullman had been like the ordinary\r\nrun of human beings, but, being altogether an extraordinary creature, he\r\nwaved his baton and the band began to play, but, far from facing the\r\nmusic which he himself had set in motion, he retired with a lawyer\r\nbodyguard to the East and viewed the concert from a distance of a\r\nthousand miles. Really, he had nothing to fear, for, as it turned out,\r\nnot a single pane of glass in his marvelous town was broken by what he\r\nregarded as a fearful mob.\r\n\r\n“The outcome of the present matter will be, of course, a demonstration\r\nthat Magnate Pullman is a bigger man than the United States\r\nCourt.”—Editorial, _Chicago Times_, February 8, 1895.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      “SHALL DEBS BE TRIED AGAIN?”\r\n\r\n“Owing to the illness of one juror the conspiracy cases against Eugene\r\nV. Debs and his associates of the American Railway Union have come to a\r\nsudden stop. The propositions of the defense to continue the hearing of\r\nthe case with eleven jurors, or to swear in a twelfth juror and proceed\r\nafter the evidence already in had been read to him, were both opposed by\r\ncounsel for the government and the railroads. As the matter now stands,\r\na new jury will have to be impaneled and the whole thing gone over\r\nagain, unless the Government decides to abandon the prosecution.\r\n\r\n“It is exceedingly unfortunate that the present trial should have been\r\ninterrupted in this unforeseen fashion. A judicial declaration upon the\r\nissues involved would have been of very decided value to all classes of\r\nsociety. As the evidence has been detailed day after day in the very\r\nfull reports in the columns of the _Times_, the people have been able to\r\ngain a clearer and more exact idea of the incidents of the great strike\r\nthan was possible in the moments of heated controversy last summer. It\r\ndoes not seem like over-statement to say that there was every indication\r\nthat the defense would be successful. The charge of conspiracy had not,\r\nat the time of the abrupt termination of the case, been at all\r\nforcefully substantiated. Interviews with the released jurors establish\r\nthe fact that they would have acquitted the defendants had the case been\r\ncarried to its regular conclusion. It is credibly asserted that the\r\nprosecution has for some time apprehended such an outcome of the trial,\r\nand it was probably for this reason that the attorneys for the\r\nGovernment exercised their undoubted right to protest against continuing\r\nwith an incomplete jury.\r\n\r\n“In this situation the question arises whether the Government shall\r\nproceed further with this prosecution. Heavy expense is involved in it\r\nand it will consume much of the time of a court already overcrowded with\r\nbusiness. It is just, too, to call attention to the fact that the\r\ndefendants are poor men. The expenses of the defense thus far have been\r\nmet by voluntary contributions from other poor men, who are in sympathy\r\nwith the men on trial. There is obvious injustice in enlarging this\r\nfinancial burden by bringing these men again to trial.\r\n\r\n“In the opinion of the _Times_ enough has been done to maintain the\r\ndignity of the State in this matter. Further prosecution of Debs and his\r\nassociates would look like persecution. The Government would better\r\nabandon the case forthwith.”—Editorial, _Chicago Times_, February 13,\r\n1895.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        “WANT A TWELFTH JUROR.”\r\n\r\n“Then there was a consultation between Court and counsel as to what to\r\ndo. To discharge this jury and commence all over again would occasion a\r\nwaste of time and delay which neither Court nor counsel wanted to\r\npermit, if there was any possible way of avoiding it. However, counsel\r\nfor the Government seemed more easily able to reconcile themselves to it\r\nthan anybody else. There was a very strong impression in the courtroom\r\nthat the Government counsel had conceived the opinion that the jury\r\nwould not convict, and were not altogether sorry something had arisen to\r\ngive them a chance for a new jury.\r\n\r\n“General Black at first thought that they could proceed with a jury of\r\neleven, if the defendants would agree. The defendants were ready to\r\nagree, but took the view, and Judge Grosscup shared it with them that\r\nsuch a stipulation would be a fatal error. Finally, General Black came\r\nto this conclusion himself. Then the defense made a proposition itself.\r\nThis was in effect that the present jury be discharged and a new one at\r\nonce impaneled, consisting of the eleven of the present jurors and a\r\ntwelfth man; that for the benefit of this twelfth man the evidence\r\nalready taken might be read over. In support of this proposition Mr.\r\nGregory read a lot of authorities, some of them interesting in\r\nthemselves, aside from any aid they might be in the present case.\r\n\r\n“The proposition was talked about informally between the Court and\r\ncounsel, and the more they talked about it the more feasible it seemed.\r\nBut before it was finally decided on Judge Grosscup wanted to sleep over\r\nit. So he adjourned court until 10 o’clock this morning.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                         DARROW MAKES A MOTION.\r\n\r\n“‘In this case, your Honor,’ said Mr. Darrow, when the court resumed at\r\nthe afternoon session, ‘we wish to make a motion in the event that the\r\nCourt should decide that it is not competent to proceed with the eleven\r\njurors, that the place of the sick juror should be filled and the case\r\nproceeded with after the evidence has been read over to the new juror,\r\nwe think we have authorities on that point and we will present them to\r\nyour Honor. The evidence could be read over and that would save the\r\nwhole time that would be occupied in representing the case to the Court.\r\nIf General Black admits this to be right, we would like to present these\r\nauthorities to the Court.’\r\n\r\n“‘When the court adjourned after the conference in your Honor’s chambers\r\nthis morning,’ said General Black, ‘I made an investigation of the\r\npoints involved and I found one authority upon the point which, it seems\r\nto me, settles the question. It is the case of Callan against Wilson,\r\ndecided by Justice Harlan. In that decision the judge discusses the\r\nquestion as to the rights of trial by jury under similar circumstances\r\nto this case, touching particularly the right of trial in conspiracy\r\ncases, and holds that it is an inalienable right that there should be a\r\ntrial by jury, which means a jury of twelve men. The authority is so\r\nconclusive that I must abandon my position.’”—_Chicago Times_, February\r\n12, 1895.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                A. R. U.\r\n\r\n (_An article in the July, 1908, number of the Journal of the Switchmen’s\r\n                                 Union._)\r\n\r\n\r\n                       MR. CONNERS ON THE STRIKE.\r\n\r\nMr. Conners in speaking of the A. R. U. strike and E. St. John, at that\r\ntime general manager of the C., R. I. & P. railway and chairman of the\r\nGeneral Managers’ Association, said that he denied that Mr. St. John\r\nbroke the backbone of the strike; on the contrary, he so exaggerated the\r\ncause of breaking the A. R. U. that he was let out of his job soon after\r\nthe strike and was practically wiped out himself as a railroad man.\r\n\r\nIt is true that Mr. St. John said to the General Managers in meeting\r\nassembled on the eve of the strike, these words:\r\n\r\n  “Gentlemen, we can handle the various brotherhoods, but we cannot\r\n  handle the A. R. U. We have got to wipe it out. We can handle the\r\n  other labor leaders, but we cannot handle Debs. We have got to wipe\r\n  him out, too.”\r\n\r\nHe closed this article in the following words:\r\n\r\n  “At the end of the strike the railroads proclaimed their triumph and\r\n  the annihilation of the A. R. U. but the principle that the A. R. U.\r\n  stood for still lives and is stronger and more in evidence today\r\n  than ever, which goes to show that wrong never really wins a victory\r\n  over right, and iniquity is never long triumphant. There have been\r\n  many changes since that great struggle against slavery, degradation\r\n  and privation. Some of the exploiters of labor prophesied the death\r\n  of the labor movement and it was down and out for a time, but\r\n  history has repeated itself. Labor unions have again become a power.\r\n  They are stronger than ever. Many an honest working man and woman\r\n  went hungry in 1894 for daring to rebel against the humiliating\r\n  conditions that existed at Pullman. Many a Union man went to jail\r\n  for disobeying the injunction judges, Grosscup, Woods and Taft, but\r\n  today we find Pullman has passed to the Great Beyond, where all are\r\n  supposed to be equal; Woods is dead; Cleveland is dead; Egan has\r\n  disappeared to God knows where; Grosscup has been under indictment;\r\n  St. John has passed into the Shadowy Valley, but Eugene Debs still\r\n  lives, loved by his fellowmen because of his honesty, for his many\r\n  sacrifices to the cause of humanity. The cause of the working class\r\n  is still here and here to stay and will be crowned gloriously\r\n  triumphant long after the oppressors and tyrants and all their\r\n  fawning retainers have gone the way of flesh and passed from\r\n  memory.”\r\n\r\nIn the _Railway Times_, published at Terre Haute, January 1, 1895,\r\nappeared the following special notice:\r\n\r\n                           “SPECIAL NOTICE.”\r\n\r\n  “The general offices of the American Railway Union and the _Railway\r\n  Times_ have been removed to Terre Haute, Indiana. The directors\r\n  having been sentenced to prison, the change was made so that the\r\n  work of the Order could be efficiently and economically done during\r\n  their confinement. The work of organizing and equipping the A. R. U.\r\n  will be pushed with unabated vigor. Insurance and secret work will\r\n  be adopted as soon as it can be done under temporarily trying\r\n  circumstances.\r\n\r\n  “All correspondence should be addressed to Eugene V. Debs, Terre\r\n  Haute, Indiana.\r\n\r\n  “TERRE HAUTE, IND., Jan. 1, 1895.”\r\n\r\nIn the evening papers of the country appeared the following on January\r\n9, 1895:\r\n\r\n\r\n “DEBS DEFIANT—ISSUES AN ADDRESS TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FROM THE JAIL.\r\n\r\n  “WOODSTOCK, ILL.—Eugene V. Debs, George Howard, Sylvester Kelliher,\r\n  Louis W. Rogers, William E. Burns, James Hogan and Leroy Goodwin are\r\n  confined in the McHenry County Jail. Last evening, as he sat in what\r\n  Cook County prisoners would call a palace, Mr. Debs issued a\r\n  manifesto to the American people, which contains the following:\r\n\r\n  “‘In going to jail for participation in the late strike we have no\r\n  apologies to make nor regrets to express. No ignominy attaches to us\r\n  on account of this sentence. I would not change places with Judge\r\n  Woods, and if it is expected that six months, or even six years in\r\n  jail will purge me of contempt, the punishment will fail of its\r\n  purpose.\r\n\r\n  “‘Candor compels me to characterize the whole proceeding as\r\n  infamous. It is not calculated to revive the rapidly failing\r\n  confidence of the American people in the federal judiciary. There is\r\n  not a scrap of testimony to show that one of us violated any law\r\n  whatsoever. If we are guilty of conspiracy, why are we punished for\r\n  contempt?\r\n\r\n  “‘I would a thousand times rather be accountable for the strike than\r\n  for the decision.\r\n\r\n  “‘We are, by chance, the mere instrumentalities in the evolutionary\r\n  processes in operation through which industrial slavery is to be\r\n  abolished and economic freedom established. Then the starry banner\r\n  will symbolize, as it was designed to symbolize, social, political,\r\n  religious and economic emancipation from the thraldom of tyranny,\r\n  oppression and degradation.’”\r\n\r\nThe following invitations were issued for a reception in honor of Mr.\r\nDebs upon his release from Woodstock Jail:\r\n\r\n  MR. ................\r\n\r\n  Dear Sir: You are cordially invited to attend a reception to be\r\n  tendered Eugene V. Debs on his release from Woodstock Jail, Friday\r\n  evening, November twenty-second, at Battery D, Chicago, by the\r\n  liberty-loving citizens of Chicago and vicinity, in testimony of\r\n  their sympathy with Mr. Debs and his colleagues in their unjust and\r\n  unlawful imprisonment and as an expression of popular aversion to\r\n  judicial despotism and devotion to Civil and Constitutional Liberty.\r\n\r\n                                         J. D. MAYERS,\r\n                                           Secretary, 405 Thirty-third\r\n                                             St., Chicago, Ill.\r\n\r\n                                         J. H. SCHWERZGEN,\r\n                                           Chm. Com. of Arrangements,\r\n                                             133 Rialto Building.\r\n\r\n  “The Reception Committee will leave this city for Woodstock on a\r\n  special train from the Chicago and Northwestern railway depot at\r\n  2:30 p. m., Friday, November 22, for the purpose of escorting Mr.\r\n  Debs to Chicago. If you desire to accompany the committee, kindly\r\n  inform the chairman or secretary. Tickets for the round trip, two\r\n  dollars.”\r\n\r\nAs the time approached when Mr. Debs’ term in prison would expire,\r\nNovember 22, 1895, great preparations for celebration were made\r\nthroughout the country, particularly in Chicago. October 31, 1895, Mr.\r\nDebs wrote from Woodstock Jail the following letter:\r\n\r\n                                              WOODSTOCK, ILL., Oct 31.\r\n\r\n  Thomas J. Elderkin,\r\n      President Trade and Labor Assembly,\r\n          Chicago, Ill.\r\n\r\n  _Dear Sir and Brother_: Your favor of the 20th inst. in reference to\r\n  the reception to be tendered my colleagues and myself upon my\r\n  release and the condition upon which the Trade and Labor Assembly of\r\n  Chicago will participate therein has been received and noted.\r\n\r\n  I quote from your letter as follows: “Some say you advocate the\r\n  abolishment of Trade Union theories, while others declare you are\r\n  still a friend and strong advocate of Trade Unions. The question of\r\n  a demonstration by the Trade and Labor Assembly upon the occasion of\r\n  your release from jail November 22, rests upon your position toward\r\n  Trade Unions, for if you still believe Trade Unions are adequate for\r\n  the emancipation of the workingmen the Trade and Labor Assembly will\r\n  cheerfully join in the demonstration.”\r\n\r\n  Permit me to decline in advance any “demonstration” on the part of\r\n  persons whose sentiments are represented in the foregoing\r\n  proposition. If the Trade and Labor Assembly of Chicago can afford\r\n  to make such a proposition, I cannot afford to consider it. For\r\n  twenty-one years I have been defining my “position” in relation to\r\n  Trade Unions, and on all proper occasions I have given full, free\r\n  and unequivocal expression to my views, but I must respectfully\r\n  decline to do so for a consideration, even though that consideration\r\n  be in the form of a reception upon my release from a jail in which I\r\n  have served a sentence of six months for my fealty to the principles\r\n  of the very Trade Unions which now propose to interrogate me as to\r\n  my “position” in relation to their interests.\r\n\r\n  The statement that I am or ever have been hostile to Trade Unions\r\n  and that I am advocating or intending to advocate their\r\n  “abolishment” is too palpably false and malicious to merit an\r\n  instant’s contention. There is, of course, a purpose in having this\r\n  question raised at this time, but it is difficult for me to conceive\r\n  that it emanates from a Trade and Labor Assembly. If it had its\r\n  origin in the General Managers’ Association or some kindred body, it\r\n  would be in consonance with the fitness of things and I should\r\n  readily understand it.\r\n\r\n  Permit me to say, therefore, that the proposed reception is in no\r\n  sense a personal affair. I understand it to be tendered in\r\n  recognition of the principles involved in the illegal and unjust\r\n  imprisonment of my colleagues and myself, and as voicing abhorrence\r\n  of, and protest against, judicial despotism in the United States,\r\n  which constitutional rights are cloven down in the interest of\r\n  corporate wealth.\r\n\r\n  I have not asked for a reception and I am sure I have no ambition to\r\n  be the guest of anyone who finds it necessary to place me on the\r\n  witness stand and interrogate me as to whether I am his friend or\r\n  his enemy, especially after serving six months in jail for\r\n  advocating his rights and defending his interests. To make myself\r\n  perfectly clear, if there are those who have any doubt as to my\r\n  “position,” then, so far as I am concerned, I advise them to take\r\n  the safe side and stay away from the intended reception.\r\n\r\n  The charge that I have “changed my views” in regard to Trades\r\n  Unions, which, as I am informed, prompted the action and attitude of\r\n  your Assembly, is simply a pretext which will serve the purpose for\r\n  which it was designed if it creates dissension, arouses a sentiment\r\n  unfavorable to the reception and makes of that occasion a dismal\r\n  failure. The reason for this is so apparent that it will readily\r\n  suggest itself. I admit that my views are subject to “change,” but\r\n  not of the legal tender variety.\r\n\r\n  I beg to assure you that no discourtesy is intended, although if the\r\n  Trade and Labor Assembly had intended a deliberate affront it could\r\n  not have adopted a method better calculated to serve that purpose\r\n  than by attempting to pillory me in public at this time on the\r\n  question of my allegiance to Organized Labor.\r\n\r\n  I have the honor to subscribe myself, with best wishes,\r\n\r\n                                                 Yours fraternally,\r\n                                                       EUGENE V. DEBS.\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. Debs was in Woodstock Jail he wrote a series of remarkable\r\nletters which were published in the daily press and these letters seem\r\nnow, in the light of industrial development, to have been filled with\r\nprophetic vision. The following are a few quotations from some of his\r\nletters:\r\n\r\n“It is time that Organized Labor should learn the power and the\r\nimperative necessity of a united ballot and in this is meant the ballot\r\nof all who work for their daily bread, without regard to color or sex.\r\nIt is also high time that allegiance to parties who make laws for the\r\nprotection of capitalists and the subjugation of labor should be\r\nabandoned and that men should be found to enact and administer laws for\r\nthe equal protection of labor which creates the capital and carries\r\nforward all the industries of the world. In this unification of labor\r\nforces for the amelioration of conditions by constitutional and lawful\r\nmethods, as are contemplated in political action, there is no need of\r\ninterfering with Trades Unions or any of the numerous social and\r\nindustrial organizations or encroaching in the slightest degree upon\r\ntheir province or functions. On the contrary, labor organizations would\r\nbe indefinitely strengthened by such a policy. The proposition is so\r\nself-evident as to require no argument for its elucidation. Until that\r\ntime comes, capitalism will be in power and have absolute control.\r\nCapitalism will make the laws and administer them, control the army,\r\nbribe the press, silence the pulpit and workingmen will pay the penalty\r\nof their ignorance and stupidity in abject slavery.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  KATHERINE METZEL DEBS\r\n\r\n  (See Page 57)\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                       DEBS’ LAST NIGHT IN JAIL.\r\n\r\nEugene Victor Debs’ last hour of imprisonment ended with the first\r\nsecond after midnight of November 22, 1895. He had gone to bed early and\r\nwas sleeping soundly when the hours of bondage merged into the hours of\r\nfreedom. He had his breakfast with the Sheriff and the Sheriff’s family\r\nand then with his brother Theodore, in a cutter, he drove about\r\nWoodstock and called on the various friends he had made while he was in\r\nprison. He came in late for dinner. During the afternoon farmers in\r\ngreat numbers came into the town to see the parade of the Chicago\r\nworking people who were to come out to greet him. School girls and boys,\r\nyoung men and young women and all sorts and conditions of people\r\nassembled at the station. The train was greeted with shouts when it\r\nturned the curve southeast of the town, and when Reichart’s Band started\r\nup the street everybody in the whole town followed to the public square.\r\nThe train had arrived at 5 o’clock. As the crowd marched toward the jail\r\nthe released prisoner stood on the stone steps in front of the Sheriff’s\r\nresidence. A crowd of big, burly workingmen rushed up and took Mr. Debs\r\nin their outstretched arms.[3] The yelling and cheering was something\r\nremarkable. Dozens hugged and kissed him. Others simply felt for his\r\nhand and if it was no more than a touch they seemed to be satisfied and\r\nwent away yelling. The crowd called “Lift him up so we can all see him.”\r\nInstantly he was hoisted up on the shoulders of the men. After the crowd\r\nhad partaken of coffee and sandwiches at the several restaurants in\r\nWoodstock, the Chicago Special was entered and from Woodstock to Chicago\r\nmusic, singing and cheering drowned the noise of the train. When the\r\ntrains arrived at the Wells street Station in Chicago, more than 100,000\r\npeople blocked the streets and bridges in the vicinity of the depot. The\r\nstreets were filled with mud and slush and a heavy rain was falling, but\r\nthe crowd did not seem to pay any attention. Mr. Debs himself refused to\r\nenter the carriage hauled by six white horses and as he took his place\r\nin the parade he said: “If the rest walk, I shall walk. What is good\r\nenough for them is good enough for me.”\r\n\r\nBattery D was crowded to its utmost capacity and his speech delivered\r\nupon that occasion was scholarly, brilliant, beautiful. The following is\r\nthe closing paragraph relative to his life in prison:\r\n\r\n“In prison my life was a busy one and the time for meditation and to\r\ngive the imagination free reign was when the daily task was over and\r\nNight’s sable curtains enveloped the world in darkness, relieved only by\r\nthe sentinel stars and the Earth’s silver satellite ‘walking in lovely\r\nbeauty to her midnight throne.’ It was at such times that the reverend\r\nstones of the prison walls preached sermons, sometimes rising in\r\ngrandeur to the Sermon on the Mount. It might be a question in the minds\r\nof some if this occasion warrants the indulgence of the fancy. It will\r\nbe remembered that Aesop taught the world by fables and Christ by\r\nparables, but my recollection is that the old stone preachers were as\r\nepigrammatic as an unabridged dictionary. I remember one old divine\r\nstone who one night selected for his text ‘George M. Pullman,’ and said\r\n‘George is a bad egg; handle him with care. If you crack his shell the\r\nodor would depopulate Chicago in an hour.’ All the rest of the stones\r\nsaid ‘Amen’ and the services closed.\r\n\r\n“Another old sermonizer who said he had been preaching since man was a\r\nmolecule declared he had of late years studied corporations and that\r\nthey were warts on the nose of national industries and that they were\r\nvultures whose beaks and claws were tearing and mangling the vitals of\r\nLabor and transforming workingmen’s homes into caves. Another old stone\r\nsaid he knew more about strikes than Carroll D. Wright and that he was\r\npresent when the slaves built the pyramids; that God himself had taught\r\nhis lightnings, thunderbolts, winds, waves and earthquakes to strike and\r\nthat striking would proceed with bullets or ballots until workingmen, no\r\nlonger deceived and cajoled by their enemies, would unify, proclaim\r\ntheir sovereignty and walk the earth free men.\r\n\r\n“I have borne with such composure as I could command the imprisonment\r\nwhich deprived me of my liberty. Were I a criminal, were I guilty of\r\ncrimes meriting a prison cell, had I ever lifted my hand against the\r\nlife or liberty of my fellowmen, had I ever sought to filch their good\r\nname I could not be here. I would have fled from the haunts of\r\ncivilization and taken up my residence in some cave where the voice of\r\nmy kindred is never heard; but I am standing here with no\r\nself-accusation of crime or criminal intent festering in my conscience,\r\nin the sunlight, once more among my fellow-men, contributing as best I\r\ncan to make this celebration day from prison a memorial day, realizing\r\nthat as Lowell sung:\r\n\r\n                 “‘He’s true to God who’s true to man;\r\n                   Wherever wrong is done,\r\n                 To the humblest and the weakest\r\n                   ’Neath the all-beholding sun,\r\n                 That wrong is also done to us;\r\n                   And they are slaves most base\r\n                 Whose love of right is for themselves,\r\n                   And not for all the race.’”\r\n\r\n       (_Quoted from the Chicago Chronicle, November 23, 1895._)\r\n\r\nThe arrival of the train bearing the party with Mr. Debs, which was\r\ncarefully awaited, was the signal for a mighty yell. The crowd on the\r\nplatform started it and it was taken up by those who thronged the stairs\r\nleading down to the platform and those who were above in the street.[4]\r\nThe cheering became deafening. When Debs appeared on the platform of the\r\ncoach the cheers became a tumult of frantic yells. Those who were\r\nnearest the labor leader rushed to him and seized him in their arms and\r\nbore him from the car into the surging, struggling, pushing, cheering,\r\nyelling throng. Sitting on the shoulders of men and raised above the\r\nheads of the crowd, bareheaded and smiling, Debs acknowledged the\r\nsalutes of the crowd, bowing and waving his hat. Whichever way the labor\r\nleader turned there was a fresh outburst of cheers but so great was the\r\ncrowd that it remained wedged together. No one could move. The police\r\ncried in vain but they could hardly hear their own voices. They pushed\r\nand struggled and pleaded with those that were nearest them to make way\r\nbut the crowd stood as an immovable wall. Those who were near enough\r\nreached out to touch the leader’s garment and those who were not were\r\nmadly striving to do so. The men who were bearing Debs on their\r\nshoulders had not gone ten paces from the car when they could go no\r\nfarther. From every direction the crowd faced toward their idol. Men\r\ncried for air and egress from the pressing mass, but no one heard them.\r\nThe policemen were as powerless as everyone else. Could they have made\r\nthemselves heard, they might have accomplished something. For twenty\r\nminutes there was not a move in the packed center. It was oppressive and\r\nsuffocating and men were being crushed and trampled. The slender form of\r\nthe man whose presence brought out the outpouring was all the while held\r\naloft and safe from the crush. A smile was playing over his clean-cut\r\nfeatures. His face was aglow with the triumph of the hour. It was only\r\nby the efforts of the policemen and the officers of the Trades Unions\r\nwhich were on the outskirts of the crowd that the jam was worked apart\r\nand got in motion. They succeeded in getting those who were on the\r\nstreet above to move back, then those who were on the broad stairway\r\nwere forced upon the street, and finally the congestion on the platform\r\nbelow was gradually relieved; but it was far from being dispersed. Two\r\npolicemen managed to fight their way to where the labor leader was held\r\nand they made a path for two more and the four policemen succeeded by\r\ntheir combined strength in making a way for Debs. Inch by inch they\r\nmoved, pushing, struggling and almost beating the crowd until they\r\ngained the stairs. As they started up, twice the tide of the throng\r\ncarried them back down to the platform after they had gained the first\r\nstep. They struggled on and on up the stairs, the great mass swaying and\r\nsometimes retreating, and all the time and above all the mighty cheering\r\nwent on. Never did men strive and struggle to so demonstrate their love\r\nfor a fellowman just released from a convict’s cell. Their’s was no\r\noutward show alone. There was no sycophancy in them. Debs was borne on\r\nthe shoulders of strong men all the way along the depot platform and up\r\nthe stairs and along the street. When he reached the Wells street bridge\r\nhe asked those who bore him to set him down where his old lieutenant,\r\nWilliam E. Burns, who was also a prisoner with Debs in Woodstock Jail,\r\nhad gotten near enough to speak to him. They halted then to form a line\r\nto march in order to Battery D.\r\n\r\nMore than fifty of the Labor Unions of Chicago were represented in the\r\nsix coaches that went out to Woodstock to receive Mr. Debs. The\r\nprocession that marched through the storm was composed of the members of\r\nevery Trade Union in the city, wearing badges and marching in his honor.\r\n\r\n\r\n   COMMISSION APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNMENT TO INQUIRE INTO THE CHICAGO\r\n                                STRIKE.\r\n\r\nIn the hearing before the Commission appointed in September,\r\nSuperintendent of Police, Mr. Brennan, stated that the acts of violence\r\nin the strike in Chicago were perpetrated by a lot of hoodlums and\r\nvicious people mixed with women and children. Fire Marshal Fitzgerald\r\ntestified that he attended nearly all of the fires and was on duty at\r\nall the fires of any magnitude. He stated that there was no interference\r\nwith the firemen at any time; the cause of the fires was due to the\r\naction of youngsters who lighted waste and other inflammable material\r\nand threw it in the cars where it would catch the woodwork. “I stopped a\r\nnumber of boys whom I saw doing such work. There was no interference\r\nattempted by railroad men. A number of railroad men helped the firemen\r\npull an engine into position at Forty-fifth street and the Fort Wayne\r\ntracks. I did not ask aid at any time during the fires.”\r\n\r\nMr. Miller, reporter for the _Chicago Tribune_, also testified that he\r\nhad an extensive acquaintance among railroad men. He said: “The trouble\r\nwas caused by hoodlums and toughs. In my reports I characterized them as\r\nhoodlums. Many of them were boys. Sobriety was the rule among the\r\nstrikers.” Mr. Miller said: “The speakers at the public meetings advised\r\nagainst violence or lawlessness. I believe they were speaking\r\nsincerely.” The testimony of many other reporters was in the same line.\r\nMr. Harding of the _Times_ testified that there was comparatively little\r\ndisorder at the Stock Yards, but that the newspaper reports contained\r\nthe accounts of fights and riots almost every night. “Captain O’Neil of\r\nthe Stock Yards police told me,” said Mr. Harding, “that volleys of\r\nshots were fired by the soldiers or the militia every day or night,\r\nwhich, on investigation, proved to have no cause other than the desire\r\nto create excitement. A crowd would naturally gather, newspaper\r\nreporters would flock around and they would gather something to tell, to\r\nbrag about in the papers. I know this is so from talks with the men\r\nthemselves.”\r\n\r\nMr. Debs was on the stand an entire day. His testimony in the following\r\nwords brought out very interesting points which the Commissioners\r\nelicited by direct question. Mr. Debs said: “Government supervision\r\nwould not answer the purpose of preventing strikes. No good could come\r\nfrom compulsory arbitration; that is a contradiction in terms. Even if\r\nsome means of enforcing the decree could be devised, those against whom\r\nthe decree was rendered would not be satisfied. The basis must be\r\nfriendship and confidence. Government ownership of railroads would be\r\nbetter than railroad ownership of Government,” said Mr. Debs. Mr. Debs\r\nstated that the railroads do not obey the decisions of the Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission. If they do not obey this Commission, he did not\r\nthink they would be likely to obey the decisions of a court of\r\narbitration, unless it suited their convenience.\r\n\r\nCommissioner Worthington asked Mr. Debs, “What about strikes in other\r\nindustries?” Mr. Debs replied, “The replacement of the wage system by\r\nthe co-operative commonwealth could alone solve the problem; as long as\r\na man is dependent on another for work, he is a slave. With labor-saving\r\nmachinery, which term is now a misnomer, as it is really\r\nlabor-displacing machinery, unrestricted emigration and ten men bidding\r\nfor a job, wages are bound to go lower and lower. Capitalists\r\ninstinctively feel their affinity. I want the working people to feel the\r\nsame way. To illustrate—in the late strike we did nothing to interfere\r\nwith the _Chicago Herald’s_ business, yet the _Herald_ felt its kinship\r\nto the capitalists who owned the railroads and made unmitigated war on\r\nthe railroad employes.”\r\n\r\nCommissioner Kernan asked Mr. Debs, “If such a unification of working\r\npeople was accomplished, would it not have a dangerous power?” Mr. Debs\r\nreplied, “A little power is more dangerous than great power. If you have\r\n100 switchmen working in a yard and ten or twelve of them are organized,\r\nyou will have a strike on your hands very soon. The unification of labor\r\nwould mean the abolition of the wage system.”\r\n\r\nChief Deputy U. S. Marshal Donnelly was one of the most interesting\r\nwitnesses before the government, because his testimony proved that the\r\nrailroads run the government. Mr. Donnelly said, “We had a regular force\r\nof men sworn in of between fourteen and fifteen hundred, and then we\r\nswore in 4,000 for the railroads. The government armed and paid the\r\nregular force and the railroads armed and paid the others. The first lot\r\nof men we got were a poor lot. We went on the street and got such men as\r\nwe could. The better class of men said they wouldn’t serve against the\r\nstrikers. At first we didn’t ask for any certificates of character or\r\nfitness. We received our instructions from Attorney General Olney. He\r\ntold us to hire all the men we needed. The number we needed was decided\r\non at conferences between the United States District Attorney and Mr.\r\nWalker, Special Assistant District Attorney, and attorney for the\r\nChicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railway. The railroads would send in a\r\nbatch of men, saying they were all right, and we gave the stars to the\r\nrailroads and took their receipt for them. These railway deputies were\r\nnot under our orders; they made their reports to no one except the chief\r\ndetectives of the railroads. They derived their authority from the\r\nUnited States. All the violence I saw and the car burning was done by\r\nboys—tough kids.”\r\n\r\n\r\n       U. S. COMMISSION HOLDS INVESTIGATION OF CAUSES OF STRIKE.\r\n\r\nMr. Debs said in his evidence in August, 1895, before the Strike\r\nCommission:\r\n\r\n“It is understood that a strike is war, not necessarily of blood and\r\nbullets, but a war in the sense that it is a conflict between two\r\ncontending interests or classes of interest. There is more or less\r\nstrategy, too, in war and this was necessary in our operations in the A.\r\nR. U. strike. Orders were issued from here; questions were answered and\r\nour men kept in line from here.”\r\n\r\nThe attorney, Mr. Milchrist, for the government in the conspiracy trial\r\nat Chicago in January, 1895, further said that it was lawful for Mr.\r\nDebs to order our members of the A. R. U. but not others. Mr. Milchrist\r\nsaid the A. R. U. had spent $3,000 on telegrams. Mr. Milchrist said the\r\nmails were tied up. “Certainly if the trains were tied up,” he said,\r\n“the government is not prosecuting the defendants for an overt act, but\r\nsimply for interfering with the United States mails.” It was argued to\r\nthe jury by Mr. Debs’ attorneys the law was used against the defendants\r\nas an excuse for working oppression, as there was no telegram or written\r\nor verbal order shown to the jury urging violence or interference with\r\nthe mails. Mr. Darrow said: “But when men strike for oppressions against\r\nothers and jeopardize their own livelihoods for the sake of those whom\r\nthey do not even know, it is so much above the ideals of the railroad\r\nmanagers that they think it is a crime.”\r\n\r\nThere were many brilliant arguments, many sharp replies during the\r\ntrial. There were many telegrams read to the jury. Here is an exact copy\r\nof one that was read and became a part of the record in the case:\r\n\r\n                                                       “July 16, 1894.\r\n\r\n  C. S. McAuliffe, Wisconsin.\r\n\r\n  “We have assurances that within 48 hours every labor organization\r\n  will come to our rescue. The tide is on and the men are acquitting\r\n  themselves like heroes. Here and there one weakens, but our cause is\r\n  strengthened by others going out in their places. Every true man\r\n  must go out and remain out until the fight is over; there must be no\r\n  half-way ground. Our cause is gaining ground daily and our success\r\n  is only a question of a few days. Don’t falter in this hour but\r\n  proclaim your manhood. Labor must win now or never. Our victory will\r\n  be certain and complete. Whatever happens don’t give any credence to\r\n  rumors and newspaper reports.\r\n\r\n                                                         “E. V. DEBS.”\r\n\r\nThis was sent to forty points. Then the troops were called and then\r\ntelegrams like this were sent over the wires:\r\n\r\n“To call out the troops was an old method for intimidation. Commit _no_\r\nviolence. Have every man stand pat. Troops cannot move trains. Not scabs\r\nenough in the world to fill places, and more help accruing hourly.”\r\n\r\nOut of 9,000 telegrams, 150 were read to the jury and they were always\r\nproper and called upon the men to commit no violence. Among them was the\r\nfamous: “Save your money and buy a gun” telegram. This was sent under\r\nthe Debs’ half-rate frank, but as shown was not authorized by him or\r\nsent with his knowledge, and when the whole telegram is read it is seen\r\nto be very innocent and harmless. The jury seemed to be amused at the\r\njuvenile attempts to fasten acts of violence on Mr. Debs. One witness,\r\nDennis Ryan, was asked if he heard anything about dynamite. He said the\r\nGreat Northern strike was won by the men standing shoulder to shoulder;\r\nthat they did not want violence. February 6 the Railroad Managers’\r\nminutes were put in the case. Several defendants were examined. It was\r\nshown that the Managers’ Association had been preparing to have a\r\nstrike, and Mr. Darrow read from their minutes dated August 31, 1893, a\r\nresolution declaiming it was desirable that a general combination of\r\nmanagers throughout the United States was desirable and that the wages\r\nof the railroad men were to be reduced and made uniform throughout the\r\ncountry. The resolution stated one of the hardest facts the managers had\r\nto contend with was the men would complain that they were not receiving\r\nequal pay to men on other roads doing similar work.\r\n\r\nFrom the minutes of the meeting of September 21, 1893, a resolution was\r\nread to the effect that however much it was to be regretted, a general\r\nreduction in the wages of the men had become absolutely necessary. It\r\nwas then shown by the defense that the Managers’ Association had\r\nestablished agencies to secure men to take the places of those who\r\nseemed likely to strike. The number of men so employed was shown by the\r\nevidence of Mr. B. Thomas, president and general manager of the Chicago\r\n& Western Indiana Railroad Company. He further testified that the\r\nAssociation was first organized on April 20, 1886, and among its objects\r\nwage schedules were to be agreed upon and stood by, by the railroads.\r\n\r\nMr. Debs was called February 7 and gave his testimony clearly and\r\nwithout hesitation. The examination was conducted by Clarence S. Darrow.\r\nHe testified that the object of the A. R. U. organization was the\r\nunification of _all_ railroad employes for their mutual benefit and\r\nprotection. The attorneys for the railroads tried hard to exclude many\r\nanswers, but the court ruled them competent and Mr. Debs said there were\r\nseveral railroad organizations and they were at war with one another and\r\nhad been for a long time. The same classes of men were eligible to\r\ndifferent organizations and the Railroad Managers’ Association played\r\noff these organizations against one another. The railroads took\r\nadvantage of this fact and made contracts with one or the other\r\norganizations and these would operate to the disadvantage of the others.\r\n\r\n“The concentration of the smaller railroads into the larger had been\r\ngoing on for 20 years, and there had been a gradual reduction of wages.”\r\nThese things compelled the idea of organization of the A. R. U.\r\n\r\nThe first strike was on the Great Northern and commenced April 13, 1894,\r\nand lasted eighteen days.\r\n\r\n“I first learned of the Pullman strike May 11, 1894. It was done\r\ncontrary to my advice. I investigated conditions at Pullman first May 4,\r\n1894, and again May 18, 1894. I made an investigation among the Pullman\r\nemployes and was helped by the Rev. Carwardine of Pullman. I came to the\r\nconclusion that the Pullman Company was in the wrong, that wages had\r\nbeen unjustifiably reduced at different times below the living point and\r\nthat rents were much too high in comparison with what was charged for\r\nthe same class of dwellings elsewhere. The Pullman Company owned the\r\nwhole town of Pullman, streets, water works, houses and everything.”\r\n\r\nNewspaper reporters were admitted to all sessions of the convention held\r\nat Chicago June 12, 1894, except one where finances were considered. All\r\ntelegrams were subjected voluntarily to the examination of the press\r\nreporters.\r\n\r\nMr. Debs then gave a resume of his speech at the convention and stated\r\nthat in his speech he spoke in particular about the victory on the Great\r\nNorthern having been a peaceful one. He then testified as to the\r\nconference held by the convention committee with Manager Wicks of the\r\nPullman Company and the committee reported June 16, that the manager of\r\nthe Pullman Company said they had nothing to arbitrate. He testified as\r\nto the speech made to the convention by Rev. Carwardine; that the Rev.\r\nCarwardine told of his three years’ life in Pullman and that the men and\r\ntheir families were at the point of starvation. The convention voted\r\n$2,000 for the relief of the Pullman employes. A committee was appointed\r\nto notify the Pullman Company that unless arbitration was agreed upon by\r\nJune 26 a boycott on Pullman cars would be ordered. He further testified\r\nthat he had advised all committees coming to his headquarters to abstain\r\nfrom any acts of violence and in reply to a question put by the counsel,\r\nreplied, “No, sir; never in all my life have I broken the law or advised\r\nothers to do so.”\r\n\r\nHis testimony was listened to with marked interest by the jury.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                A. R. U.\r\n\r\nIn the Chicago strike the strikers were not responsible for the burning\r\nof the property of the railroads. It was not done until after the\r\narrival of the United States troops. It was done then at the instance of\r\nthe railroads because the railroads knew that without violence they\r\nwould lose the strike. People who doubt this statement are referred to\r\nthe reports of Chief Brennan of the Chicago Police, Hon. Carroll D.\r\nWright, head of the Labor Bureau, and the reports of the governor of\r\nIllinois, and the report of the Special United States Commission that\r\nheard witnesses of all sorts in their investigation of the A. R. U.\r\nstrike.\r\n\r\nThe substance of the report of the commission was as follows:\r\n\r\n  “The third smash-up comes from the commissioners appointed by\r\n  Cleveland, who make their report to Congress, that the Managers’\r\n  Association at Chicago who fought the A. R. U. threw the whole\r\n  country into turmoil and dismay, stopped traffic and destroyed\r\n  commerce, was an utterly illegal body. The twenty-four railroads,\r\n  including the Southern Pacific, Atchison and Southern California,\r\n  which so ruthlessly pursued the employes to crush and starve them\r\n  are now pronounced to have had no ‘standing in law.’ And yet, they\r\n  had the influence to bring into their support the Federal executive\r\n  and army and navy and all the machinery and power of the Federal\r\n  courts. The commission says: ‘If we regard its practical workings\r\n  rather than its profession, as expressed in its constitution, the\r\n  General Managers’ Association has no more standing in law than an\r\n  old trunk line pool. It cannot incorporate because railroad charters\r\n  do not authorize roads to form associations or corporations to fix\r\n  rates for service or wages, nor to battle with strikers. It is\r\n  usurpation of power not granted. In fact, this “usurpation” had\r\n  extended everywhere by courts as well as Railroad Managers’\r\n  Associations. The latter can be classed with the other cutthroat\r\n  organizations of hirelings and Hessians, who for money will start\r\n  out to kill any citizens at the order of the corporations—the\r\n  Pinkertons.’”\r\n\r\nThe commission says: “An extension of the Association, as above\r\nsuggested, and the proposed legalization of pooling, would result in an\r\naggregation of power and capital dangerous to the people and their\r\nliberties, as well as to their employes and rights.” And they might have\r\nadded that with the aid of the Federal judiciary these twenty-four\r\nmanagers could have subverted the constitution and erected a despotism.\r\nThe commission thoroughly endorses the legality of the actions of the A.\r\nR. U. and refutes the charge that they were guilty of violence or\r\nencouraging it. They say:\r\n\r\n“It should be noted that until the railroads set the example, the great\r\nunion of railroad employes was never attempted. * * * The refusal of the\r\nGeneral Managers to recognize and deal with such a combination of labor\r\nas the American Railway Union, seems arrogant and absurd, when we\r\nconsider its standing before the law, its assumption, and its past and\r\nobviously contemplated future action.”\r\n\r\nAnother signal reversal of the position assumed by the United States\r\ncourts in the Chicago cases came in the shape of a reversal by the\r\nFederal Court of Appeals in the opinion of Justice Harlan against the\r\nuse of equity proceedings to punish railway employes by means of\r\ncontempt in injunctions and especially that the act of July 2, 1890, was\r\ntotally inapplicable. Another was in the opinion filed by Attorney\r\nGeneral Olney, who practically reversed himself when he declared in his\r\nbrief to the United States Circuit Court that the position taken by the\r\nreceiver of the Reading Railroad was entirely illegal and unjustifiable\r\nin his notice to the men that he would dismiss all who remained members\r\nof labor organizations of railways. It controverts everything that has\r\nbeen done in the Chicago cases and in other Federal courts on the\r\nsubject of the A. R. U. and other brotherhoods.\r\n\r\nAfter the appearance of the report of the strike commission, Mr. Debs\r\nwrote the following letter to the _New York World_, in reply to some\r\ncriticisms of the report of the commission: To the Editor of the\r\n_World_:\r\n\r\nThe report of the strike commission is eminently fair and impartial and\r\nmeets with the unqualified approval of not only the A. R. U. but of all\r\npeople who believe in the American spirit of fair play and desire the\r\nenthronement of justice. The conclusions of the board are based on the\r\ntestimony and both are presented with absolute impartiality. The result\r\nis a triumphant vindication of the American Railway Union and fixes the\r\nresponsibility for the lawlessness, violence, arson and loss of life\r\nwith the General Managers’ Association, where it properly belongs. Any\r\nintimation that I wrote the report or any part of it, or that I had\r\nanything to do with its preparation, directly or indirectly, is totally\r\nand maliciously false. I simply rendered my testimony in open session\r\nand then and there my connection with the board ceased. I never met or\r\ncorresponded with any member of the board, either before or after my\r\ntestimony was given.\r\n\r\n                                                         EUGENE V. DEBS.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Debs made his first political speech for the Democratic party in\r\n1878. He was tendered the nomination for Congress by that party and\r\ndeclined it.\r\n\r\nIn 1885 he was elected to the Indiana legislature and ran on the\r\nDemocratic ticket with the avowed purpose of securing needed legislation\r\nfor the working class in general, and railway employes in particular. In\r\nwas this year, 1885, June 9, he was married to Katherine\r\nMetzel,[5]—“Kate” he affectionately calls her. She is one of the noblest\r\ntypes of women. She was born in Pittsburg, but her parents were\r\nKentuckians. She is in thorough sympathy with him on social and economic\r\nquestions and aids him materially in his work. She is always ready to\r\ngive him up to the Cause and in every way adds to his strength, helping\r\nto keep his vast correspondence in order and all his books and papers\r\nare instantly accessible. No children have blessed their lives. A little\r\nnephew has his home with them and Gene is a lover of children and always\r\nhas time for their companionship.\r\n\r\nGene is distinctively a “home man;” belongs to no social lodge or club,\r\nsimply because he wishes to spend his evenings at home. The Sunday\r\nevenings are home meetings and three generations met Sunday evenings\r\nwhen father and mother were living. He said, “My father and I were boon\r\ncompanions,[6] and I tell you, I miss it when I cannot have my Sunday\r\nevening talks with him. When I am out traveling, every day seems alike,\r\nbut when Sunday evening comes, I invariably feel something tugging at my\r\nheart strings.”\r\n\r\nHe said, without hesitation, “The dominant influence in my life has been\r\nmy ‘mother.’ Whatever of good there is in me I owe to her. Do you know,”\r\nhe said, “I care absolutely nothing for the praise or condemnation of\r\nthe world so long as my wife and my mother think I am in the right.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                         PERSONAL DESCRIPTION.\r\n\r\nHe is tall, six feet, two inches; is slim, powerfully built; a fine\r\nhead, proudly set above broad shoulders; long, full neck; face clear,\r\nfinely cut, smoothly shaven; blue, deep, searching, inquiring, frank,\r\nopen eyes; a smile, childlike and sweet, usually upon his face;\r\nsometimes sad, as sad as Lincoln’s. He is plain, dresses plainly, neatly\r\nalways; is rational, logical, epigrammatic; quick words fit his\r\nthoughts; incisive and unambiguous, they seem to flow to him from a\r\nvast, well-filled vocabulary. He quotes from the great writers and\r\npoets, is intimate with them all; speaks fluently, never hesitates,\r\ndraws faultless word pictures, makes epigrams, plain, pointed and easily\r\nremembered; gestures almost only with the right hand, steps quietly,\r\nleans forward to his audience, poised and when speaking his eyes seem\r\nlike the eyes of a painting—to look at each one everywhere in his\r\naudience.\r\n\r\nIn 1878 Mr. Debs met Wendell Phillips and Robert G. Ingersoll. Their\r\ngreat oratorical powers inspired him to study the power of speech to\r\nmove men, and no American has been a more tireless student of literature\r\nand the art of expression than he. To the end of Mr. Ingersoll’s life he\r\nkept up an intimate correspondence with him upon all vital questions and\r\nwas greatly aided by Mr. Ingersoll’s good advice and able suggestions.\r\nTo further equip himself for speaking and debating, he became an active\r\nmember of the one-time locally famous Occidental Literary Club, and was\r\na live and aggressive member, writing great papers and acquitting\r\nhimself in the highest manner in every debate.\r\n\r\nHis home library[7] is large and the books it contains are on all phases\r\nof human history, politics, government, philosophy, religion, poetry and\r\nthe arts, and they bear the marks of having been intimately handled.\r\n\r\nHe is a great reader and he has a wonderful and most orderly lot of\r\nmagazine articles which he has had bound in volumes; newspaper clippings\r\narranged in scrap books of ready reference; letters carefully filed and\r\nindexed.\r\n\r\nHe has been heard before vast audiences at Chautauquas, colleges, opera\r\nhouses, labor halls, mining camps, farmers’ festivals, etc.\r\n\r\nIn Faneuil Hall, Boston, under time-honored custom, no seats are\r\nallowed; audience and speaker stand. This permits the largest possible\r\nattendance. At Mr. Debs’ October speech, 1904, the old Cradle of Liberty\r\nwas packed to the sidewalk. It would be a mistake to state that only\r\nlaboring people are interested in his economic discussions. Business men\r\nare keenly awake to the fact that this subject is the question of our\r\nday. In 1899 Mr. Debs spoke before the Nineteenth Century Club at\r\nDelmonico’s, New York, and drew some word pictures that stood out like\r\nliving flames. He touched the vulnerable spots in his listeners that\r\nleft impressions for life. He never needlessly offends. At Harvard, Ann\r\nArbor and before the greatest educational institutions he has been heard\r\nby wonderfully appreciative audiences. At Harvard the students were\r\ntremendously enthusiastic; at Ann Arbor the Professor of Elocution told\r\nhis classes that they had never heard a more accomplished orator, and\r\nthe demonstration that followed his address to the students in the vast\r\nuniversity amphitheatre will never be forgotten by those having the\r\nfortune to have heard it.\r\n\r\nThe most prized memento of the great strike is a little note from Eugene\r\nField, the Chicago poet, author of “The Little Boy Blue.” It seems that\r\nthe poet had advance knowledge that Mr. Debs was to be arrested and he\r\ndrove to Mr. Debs’ headquarters and as Gene was not in he left the note\r\nwhich read:\r\n\r\n  “Dear Gene: I hear that you are to be arrested. When that time comes\r\n  you will need a friend. I want to be that friend.\r\n\r\n                                                        EUGENE FIELD.”\r\n\r\nFrom a letter from F. L. Thompson, Lansing, Mich., in _Lansing Tribune_,\r\nFebruary 3, 1899, after hearing Mr. Debs’ lecture on “Labor and\r\nLiberty:”\r\n\r\n  “I was pastor at Pullman some years ago and know the truth of all\r\n  Mr. Debs said of that place. He might have said much more and still\r\n  have been fully within the truth.”\r\n\r\nFrom hundreds of letters and telegrams that poured in upon Mr. Debs\r\nduring the A. R. U. strike and while he was in prison are here given a\r\nfew, to show how his strength was increased and his courage fortified by\r\nloving words from home and friends everywhere:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 DEBS.\r\n\r\nNow and then out of the veiled universe comes a friend. In that hour,\r\nand in oft-repeated hours during our lifetime, he is the builder and the\r\nbearer of our dearest thought.\r\n\r\nNow and then History, in her long, wavering, stumbling, but ever forward\r\ncourse, gives us a Hugo, an O’Connell, a Phillips, and now at last,\r\nthank Heaven, a Debs.\r\n\r\nSeeing such men, we can realize why Emerson and Whitman can forever have\r\npatience and hope, and look to the sure-coming of the bright days.\r\n\r\nDebs greets us and our day is brighter,—sweeter. His every word is a\r\nstory. Every word a song. Every word is the bearer of purest love. His\r\ntones are sweet like tones of bells. His tones are firm like bell-tones.\r\nGreeting us, Debs leaves with us a bit of himself which will not leave\r\nus while we live. Debs comes to us with greatest love,—and the greatest\r\nlover is the greatest man.\r\n\r\n                                                         GEO. F.

I don’t want to crowd in. But I\r\nwant to send you my love. There is always time for love. You are a man\r\nupon whom love has showered its darling gifts. Cherish them. They are\r\nworth while. They are all that is worth while. You have troubles. I know\r\nabout them. But you have lovers, and the light is full in your face, and\r\nyou are leading men on towards the fulfillment of man’s noblest dream. I\r\nknow that though sorrow comes you are still satisfied.

Evinger,\r\n     Labor Day Committee, Terre Haute, Ind.\r\n\r\nDear Sir and Brother: I am in receipt of your esteemed favor of the 19th\r\ninst., in which you say: “We have been unable to get a representative\r\nlabor speaker for our Labor Day celebration and the committee ordered me\r\nto ask you to write us a letter to be read on the occasion.”\r\n\r\nIn responding to your request I am disposed to recite a page of what all\r\nChristendom proclaims “sacred history.”\r\n\r\nThere existed some twenty-five hundred years ago a king clothed with\r\nabsolute power, known as Darius, who ruled over the Medes and the\r\nPersians. He was not a usurper like Wm. A. Woods, the United States\r\nCircuit Judge. Darius was royal spawn. His right to rule was what kings\r\nthen, as now, claimed to be a “divine right.” All the people in Darius’\r\nempire were slaves. The will of the king was absolute. What the king\r\nsaid was law, just as we now find in the United States of America that\r\nwhat a United States judge says is law. Darius, the Persian despot,\r\ncould imprison at will; the same is true of Woods, the despot. There is\r\nabsolutely no difference. Do I hear an exception? Allow me to support my\r\nindictment by authority that passes current throughout the Republic.\r\nOnly a few days ago the venerable Judge Trumbull, one of the most\r\neminent jurists and statesmen America has ever produced, wrote these\r\nburning words: “The doctrine announced by the Supreme Court in the Debs\r\ncase, carried to its logical conclusion, places every citizen at the\r\nmercy of any prejudiced or malicious federal judge, who may think proper\r\nto imprison him.” This states the case of the officers of the American\r\nRailway Union in a nutshell. They violated no law, they committed no\r\ncrime, they have not been charged, nor indicted, nor tried, and yet they\r\nwere arbitrarily sentenced and thrust in jail and what has happened to\r\nthem will happen to others who dare protest against such inhumanity as\r\nthe monster Pullman practiced upon his employes and their families.\r\n\r\nMore than twenty-five hundred years have passed to join the unnumbered\r\ncenturies since Darius lived and reigned, and now in the United States\r\nwe have about four score Darius despots, each of whom may at his will,\r\nwhim or pleasure, imprison an American citizen—and this grim truth is up\r\nfor debate on Labor Day.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that during the reign of Darius there was a\r\ngentleman by the name of Daniel whom the king delighted to honor. The\r\nonly fault that could be found with Daniel was that he would not worship\r\nthe Persian gods, but would, three times a day, go to his window,\r\nlooking toward Jerusalem, and pray. This was his crime. It was enough.\r\nThe Persians had a religion of their own. They had their gods of gold,\r\nbrass, stone, clay, wood, anything from a mouse to a mountain, and they\r\nwould not tolerate any other god. They had, in modern parlance, an\r\n“established church,” and as Daniel, like Christ, would not conform to\r\nthe Persian religion, “the presidents of the kingdom, the governors and\r\nthe princes, the counselors and the captains,” or as in these later days\r\nthe corporations, the trusts, the syndicates and combines, concluded to\r\nget rid of Daniel and they persuaded Darius to issue an injunction that\r\nno man should “ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days save of\r\nthee, O king”—and the king, a la Woods, issued the decree. But Daniel,\r\nwho was made of resisting stuff, disregarded the injunction and still\r\nprayed as before to his God. Daniel was a hero. In the desert of\r\ndespotism he stands forever:\r\n\r\n         “As some tall cliff that lifts its awful form,\r\n         Swells from the vale and midway leaves the storm:\r\n         Though round its breast the rolling clouds are spread,\r\n         Eternal sunshine settles on its head.”\r\n\r\nBut the bigots triumph for a time. The king’s decree must stand, and\r\nDaniel, as a penalty for prayer, must be cast into the lion’s den and\r\nthe bigots, the plutocratic pirates and parasites of that period,\r\nthought that would be the end of Daniel. They chuckled as in fancy they\r\nheard the lions break his bones and lap his blood. They slept well and\r\ndreamed of victory. Not so with the king. He knew he had been guilty of\r\nan act of monstrous cruelty and in this the old Persian despot was\r\nsuperior to Woods. The king could not sleep and was so pained over his\r\nact that he forbade all festivities in his palace. In this he showed\r\nthat he was not totally depraved. The king had a lurking idea that\r\nsomehow Daniel would get out of the lion’s den unharmed and that he\r\nwould overcome the intrigues of those who had conspired to destroy him.\r\nEarly in the morning he went to the mouth of the den. Daniel was safe.\r\nHis God, unlike the Supreme Court, having found Daniel innocent of all\r\nwrongdoing, locked the jaws of the lions and Daniel stood before the\r\nking wearing the redemption of truth, more royal than a princely diadem.\r\nThen the king who had been deceived by the enemies of Daniel, the\r\nsycophants and the vermin of power, gave his wrath free reign and had\r\nthem cast into the lion’s den where they were devoured by the ferocious\r\nbeasts.\r\n\r\nHistory repeats itself. I am not a Daniel but I am in jail by the decree\r\nof the autocrat. I appealed from one despot to a whole bench for\r\njustice, and the appeal was unheeded. I and my associates were innocent.\r\nThere was no stain of crime upon our record but neither innocence nor\r\nconstitution was of any avail. To placate the corporations, the money\r\npower, the implacable enemies of labor, we were sent to prison and here\r\nalone, contemplating the foul wrong inflicted upon me and my associate\r\nofficials of the American Railway Union, with head and heart and hand\r\nnerved for the task, I write this letter to be read on Labor Day to\r\nfriends and neighbors in the city of my birth.\r\n\r\nIt is not a wail of despondency nor of despair. The cause for which I\r\nhave been deprived of my liberty was just and I am thrice armed against\r\nall my enemies. To bear punishment for one’s honest convictions is a\r\nglorious privilege and requires no high order of courage.\r\n\r\nNo judicial tyrant comes to my prison to inquire as to my health or my\r\nhopes, but one sovereign does come by night and by day, with words of\r\ncheer. It is the sovereign people—the uncrowned but sceptered ruler of\r\nthe realm. No day of my imprisonment has passed that the bars and bolts\r\nand doors of the Woodstock Jail have not been bombarded by messages\r\nbreathing devotion to the cause of liberty and justice, and as I read\r\nand ponder these messages and as I grasp the hands of friends and catch\r\nthe gleam of wrath in their defiant eyes and listen to their words of\r\nheroic courage, I find it no task to see the wrath of the sovereign\r\npeople aroused and all opposition to the triumphant march of labor\r\nconsigned to oblivion, and as an earnest of this from every quarter come\r\nannouncements that the American Railway Union is growing in membership\r\nand strength, destined at an early day to be, as it deserves to be, an\r\norganization, which by precept, example and principle will ultimately\r\nunify railroad labor in the United States and make it invincible. There\r\nis a mighty mustering of all the forces of labor throughout the country.\r\nLabor is uniting in one solid phalanx to secure justice for labor. When\r\nthis time comes, and coming it is, peacefully, I hope no judicial despot\r\nwill dare to imprison an American citizen to please corporations. When\r\nthis time comes, and coming it is as certain as rivers flow to the sea,\r\nBullion and Boodle will not rule in Congress, in legislatures and in\r\ncourts, and legislators and judges and other public officers will not be\r\ncontrolled, as many of them are, by the money power. There is to come a\r\nday, aye, a labor day, when from the center to the circumference of our\r\nmighty Republic, from blooming groves of orange to waving fields of\r\ngrain, from pinelands of Maine to the Pacific Coast, the people shall be\r\nfree and it will come by the unified voice and vote of the farmer, the\r\nmechanic, and the laborer in every department of the country’s\r\nindustries.\r\n\r\nI notice in your letter that you say: “We have been unable to get a\r\nrepresentative labor speaker for our Labor Day celebration,” and here\r\nlet me say that on Labor Day all men who wear the badge of labor are\r\n“representative speakers”—not “orators,” perhaps, as the term is\r\naccepted to mean, and yet orators in fact, from whose lips fall\r\n“thoughts that breathe and words that burn;” coming warm from the heart,\r\nthey reach the heart and fan zeal in a great cause into a flame that\r\nsweeps along like a prairie fire. It has been the good fortune of labor\r\nto produce from its ranks men who, though unlearned in the arts or\r\noratory, were yet orators of the highest order, if effect instead of\r\nfluency is considered. It is the occasion that makes the orator as it is\r\nthe battle that makes the veteran. Mark Antony said, “I am no orator\r\nlike Brutus,” but when he showed Caesar’s mantle to the populists of\r\nRome and pointed out where the conspirators’ daggers had stabbed Caesar,\r\nthe oratory of Brutus paled before his burning words. And every man,\r\nhowever humble he may esteem himself, may on Labor Day hold up the\r\nConstitution of the United States and point to where the judicial dagger\r\nstabbed liberty to death, and make the people cry out for the\r\nre-enthronement of the constitution—and Terre Haute has a hundred such\r\norators.\r\n\r\nI write in the hurry and press of business. Before me are a hundred\r\nletters demanding replies. I pass them by to respond to an appeal from\r\nmy home, and in fancy, as I write, I am with you. I am at home again. My\r\nfather bending beneath the weight of many years salutes me. My mother,\r\nwhose lullaby songs nestle and coo in the inner temple of my memory,\r\ncaresses me—her kiss baptizes me with joy and as if by enchantment:\r\n\r\n                   “Years and sin and folly flee,\r\n                   And leave me at my mother’s knee.”\r\n\r\nIn this mood I write with the hope that the celebration at Terre Haute\r\nwill inspire renewed devotion to the interests of labor, and with a\r\nheart full of good wishes, I subscribe myself,\r\n\r\n                                                      Yours fraternally,\r\n                                                      E.

E. HORTON.\r\n\r\n To Eugene V. Debs, Esq.,\r\n     Woodstock, Ill., Nov. 22, 1895.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          DEBS AND THE POETS.\r\n\r\n          (_Clipping from New York Socialist, June 20, 1908._)\r\n\r\nAn infallible instinct for heart-analysis appears to be an attribute of\r\nthe poets. For the most part they possess an unfailing judgment of\r\ncharacter-worth, and whomsoever they know well and call good is apt to\r\nbe a pretty safe pilgrim to tie to. President Roosevelt, of vituperative\r\nvocabulary, may loudly denounce him as an “undesirable citizen,” but\r\nwhen the poets with deeper discernment and prophetic vision pronounce\r\nhim a “desirable citizen” they voice the sure verdict of the justifying\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nTo Eugene V. Debs have the poets been especially kind, for in him have\r\nthey recognized a kindred spirit. In him they have detected the true\r\nimpulse of the brotherhood, concerning which no poet can well be\r\ndeceived. They have found that his mind is a garden in bloom, and that\r\nhis soul is filled with fragrance. So right blithely have they sung him\r\nof their best, and many of Fame’s favorites have been proud to call him\r\nfriend—they who “sit at wine with the Maidens Nine and the gods of the\r\nelder days.”\r\n\r\nIt was James Whitcomb Riley who thus characteristically expressed\r\nhimself concerning this beloved Apostle of Advancement:\r\n\r\n“God was feeling mighty good when he created ’Gene Debs, and He didn’t\r\nhave anything else to do all day.”\r\n\r\nAnother poet of world-wide fame—Eugene Field—who was extremely\r\ndiscriminating in his friendships and exceedingly sparing of compliment,\r\nsaid: “’Gene Debs is the most lovable man I ever knew. Debs is sincere.\r\nHis heart is as gentle as a woman’s and as fresh as a mountain brook. If\r\nDebs were a priest the world would listen to his eloquence, and that\r\ngentle, musical voice and sad, sweet smile of his would soften the\r\nhardest heart.”\r\n\r\nThere have been paid to Debs enough tender tributes in verse to fill a\r\nlarge volume. At one time when Riley was confined to his room by\r\nillness, Debs sent him a bouquet of the poet’s favorite flowers, which\r\ncalled forth the following appreciation:\r\n\r\n                           THEM FLOWERS.\r\n\r\n             (To My Good Friend, Eugene V. Debs.)\r\n\r\n         Take a feller ’ats sick, and laid up on the shelf,\r\n             All shaky, and ga’nted and pore,\r\n         And all so knocked out he can’t handle hisself\r\n           With a stiff upper lip any more;\r\n         Shet him up all alone in the gloom of a room\r\n           As dark as a tomb, and as grim,\r\n         And then take and send him some roses in bloom,\r\n           And you kin have fun out o’ him!\r\n\r\n         You’ve seed him, ’fore now, when his liver was sound,\r\n           And his appetite notched like a saw,\r\n         A chaffin’ you, mebby, for romancin’ round\r\n           With a big posey bunch in yer paw.\r\n         But you ketch him, say, when his health is away\r\n           And he’s flat on his back, in distress,\r\n         And then you can trot out your little bokay\r\n           And not be insulted, I guess!\r\n\r\n         You see, it’s like this, what his weaknesses is,\r\n           Them flowers makes him think of the days\r\n         Of his innocent youth, and that mother o’ his,\r\n           And the roses she used to raise;\r\n         So here all alone with the roses you send,\r\n           Bein’ sick and all trimbly and faint,\r\n         My eyes is—my eyes is—my eyes is—old friend,\r\n           Is a-leakin’—I’m blamed ef they ain’t!\r\n\r\nAnd in the “Hoosier Bard’s” poem “Regardin’ Terry Hut,” appears these\r\nlines:\r\n\r\n                And there’s ’Gene Debs—a man ’at stands\r\n                And jest holds out in his two hands\r\n                As warm a heart as ever beat\r\n                Betwixt here and the Jedgment Seat.\r\n\r\nThe picturesque genius, Capt. Jack Crawford, renowned as “The\r\nPoet-Scout,” wrote of Debs:\r\n\r\n            The same old pard of long ago,\r\n            The whole-souled ’Gene I used to know,\r\n            With the love of Truth writ on Justice’s scroll,\r\n            With a woman’s heart and a warrior’s soul.\r\n\r\nAt a reception given to Debs by the Denver Press Club Walter Juan Davis\r\nrecited these lines, written for the occasion:\r\n\r\n                                    DEBS.\r\n\r\n            It is not his craft or creed,\r\n              It is not the winged word\r\n            That springs from his soul to his lips, at need,\r\n              And, flying, is felt and heard;\r\n            But something down in us all\r\n              That makes us respect the man\r\n            Who says unto great and small:\r\n              “You’ve a right to do what you can;\r\n            You’ve a right to preserve and keep\r\n              Such things as the gods gave you;\r\n            You’ve a right to your hours of sleep\r\n              And the worth of the things you do;\r\n            You’ve a right to the million or dime\r\n              That your brain or your brawn has won;\r\n            But not in the length of time;\r\n              In the light of the moon or sun,\r\n            Have you a right to a thing\r\n            That you steal or wring\r\n              From me or from any one.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1904 he made such a campaign as no other man ever endured. He began\r\nat Indianapolis September 1, and from that date traveled to New York,\r\nand thence to California, thence to Portland, Maine, thence to his home,\r\nTerre Haute, closing his campaign in his home city before an audience of\r\nseveral thousands, and at least 2,000 could not gain entrance. During\r\nthis time he did not miss an appointment by even one minute. He spoke\r\nevery day and some days two, three and even four times. The crowds were\r\nso great in the large cities it seemed impossible for him to enter or go\r\nfrom the building at the close of the meetings. On several occasions it\r\nbecame necessary to stop and speak a few minutes to the waiting\r\nthousands on the streets. He had gone alone during all this time except\r\nfrom October 17 to November 8, when from Chicago to Portland and thence\r\nto Terre Haute, Comrade Reynolds, of Terre Haute, was with him,\r\nassisting in all possible ways to lighten the heavy work.\r\n\r\nOwing to the lack of funds of the working class party Mr. Debs had been\r\nattending to baggage, hotels, time tables, and the vast correspondence\r\nnecessarily following him. The old parties had the noise, brass bands,\r\nPullman trains, luxuries of every sort, torch-lights and plenty of\r\nmoney. The Debs meetings were held in the largest obtainable audience\r\nrooms in the larger cities and were paid for by tickets of admission,\r\nand these meetings in every case netted to the campaign fund of the\r\nSocialist party considerable sums of money, from which Mr. Debs received\r\nonly the expenses of travel, which were not very heavy.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the facts stated, most of the great capitalist papers either\r\nignored these meetings or belittled them, or flatly misrepresented them,\r\nbut the people are quick nowadays to get the truth about these things\r\nand there will be more wonderful meetings in the campaign of 1908 than\r\never before known by a rising militant minor political party. Those who\r\nheard him, heard the polished American orator; those who agreed with him\r\nwere strengthened and confirmed in their beliefs; those who came seeking\r\nTruth were moved by his oratory and convinced by his array of facts and\r\nunerring logic, in making conclusions from them, while those who\r\ndisagreed were disarmed of prejudice and commended him as a sincere,\r\nearnest man.\r\n\r\nIn 1880 he persuaded Susan B. Anthony to speak in Terre Haute in a\r\nseries of meetings advocating Woman’s Suffrage, and with her he walked\r\nand stood the odium that ignorance and prejudice poured out upon that\r\ngreat human question, at that time not so popular as it now is, when\r\n100,000 women may surround the Parliament of England and demand that the\r\nvoices of women be counted in the rules of life that concern them and\r\ntheir children as it does men and their children.\r\n\r\nMr. Debs has always stood for equality of rights, equality of\r\nopportunity for men and women everywhere without distinction of race,\r\nreligion, color, or sex, and no Socialist platform fails to clearly\r\nstate its attitude upon these great vital questions. Search the old\r\nparty platforms and you may find terms of evasion but not of real\r\naffirmation of these fundamental demands.\r\n\r\nMr. Debs was nominated by the Socialist party for President in 1900,\r\nreceiving 97,000 votes; again in 1904, receiving 409,000 votes; again in\r\n1908.\r\n\r\nDebs has said these immortal words to the working people:\r\n\r\n“I am not a Labor Leader; I do not want you to follow me or anyone else;\r\nif you are looking for a Moses to lead you out of this capitalist\r\nwilderness, you will stay right where you are. I would not lead you into\r\nthis promised land if I could, because if I could lead you in, someone\r\nelse would lead you out. YOU MUST use your heads as well as your hands,\r\nand get yourselves out of your present condition; as it is now the\r\ncapitalists use your heads and your hands.”\r\n\r\nTo teach, to serve is his mental and moral mission. He seeks no place of\r\npower or profit,—did not want to be nominated either time for the\r\npresidency, but when the rank and file lead and order, he has never\r\nhesitated to obey, and he believes, with unquestioning faith and love\r\nfor the people, that when they are educated and understand, they will\r\npeacefully and intelligently set government about its proper\r\nbusiness,—the government of the forces of production and the same\r\narrangements of distributing the things the people need, and must have,\r\nif they are ever to rise to complete physical, mental and spiritual\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\nIn closing this necessarily brief and meager biographical sketch of this\r\ntrue, living, loving and lovable man, true neighbor, really “desirable\r\ncitizen,” and unimpeached and unimpeachable representative and servant\r\nof the working class, I cannot tell in any better way of “Debs at Home”\r\nthan in the little pamphlet I wrote in 1904. It needs no change. He has\r\nonly grown every day in intellectual and spiritual stature, more wise,\r\nmore patient, more uncompromising and unconquerably aggressive and more\r\nloving and lovable and, therefore, able more safely to teach the workers\r\nand more to be feared by the exponents of the rapidly-dying system of\r\ncapitalism tottering to its inevitable grave, dying because it has\r\nserved its period of usefulness, because it now hurts, degrades and\r\nhumiliates all of the human family.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             DEBS AT HOME.\r\n\r\nHere, in Terre Haute, where “Gene” Debs lives, everybody admires him.\r\nAll who know him personally love him. He has no personal enemies; he has\r\nenemies, but they do not know him. He has none in Terre Haute. Many here\r\nwould like to hang his ideas, but the man, the strong personality, the\r\ngentleness and cordiality of his greeting when he meets his neighbors\r\nand fellow-citizens, disarm all prejudice. Politicians here, as\r\nelsewhere, fear him, for they know that his intrepid soul knows and\r\npermits no intellectual fears, stoops to no intellectual prostitution.\r\nHe is as open and fearless when called upon for an opinion upon any\r\nmatters of local interest as he is when he assails the capitalist\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nI remember first seeing him in the editorial office of the Locomotive\r\nFiremen’s Magazine. I was struck by his alertness and the unhesitating\r\nspeed of his work, whether engaged in writing or arranging the details\r\nof printing, mailing or distributing the great magazine among the\r\nthousands of workers who read and had profitable enjoyment from its\r\npages. I next remember his home-coming after the A. R. U. had won the\r\nGreat Northern strike. An immense throng met him at the depot with the\r\nRinggold Band, drum corps and torchlights. They had a carriage for him,\r\nbut he protested and took his place in the ranks with the men,—only a\r\nlook of joy shone on his face, nothing of exultation; he was as\r\nunconscious of himself then as he seems ever to be and is. The shouts of\r\n“Welcome Home” seemed only to elate and inspire his soul to do more for\r\nthe cause of labor. Then I remember (I was a Republican at the time)\r\nreading of the awful strike begun in Chicago in 1894. I shared with\r\nothers in my ignorance in condemnation of the things reported from\r\nChicago. I commiserated his confinement in jail at Woodstock but\r\nbelieved, as millions equally as ignorant as I was then believed, that\r\nthe laws had been upheld. I know now the details of the wrongs that in\r\nthe name of Law and Order were heaped upon the cause of labor then and\r\nunderstand the superb courage and patience of labor’s greatest and most\r\nfar-seeing leader,—Debs.\r\n\r\nWhen he came from Woodstock Jail to Terre Haute it had been raining all\r\nday. Mr. Debs’ train arrived at 7:00 o’clock. There were several hundred\r\npeople at the depot, among them 200 miners with the Coal Bluff Band.\r\nEscorted by the band he walked to his home, a few squares from the\r\ndepot. There he found his aged father and mother, and they clung to him,\r\nkissing him again and again. After he had had his supper he was escorted\r\nto the Armory through the rain, along the route blazing with Roman\r\ncandles. After the enthusiastic cheering and greeting had subsided, Mr.\r\nDebs made a short speech to the audience and afterwards he was kept busy\r\nshaking hands with his friends.\r\n\r\nI do not know much of those long, fallow years when he went deep into\r\nthe movement of things. I became a Socialist in 1899, entirely\r\nuninfluenced and alone. I emerged and found myself and a new life, a new\r\noutlook, and stand now serenely, knowing that the end of capitalism is\r\nin sight and the day of better things is certain.\r\n\r\nI feel yet the throb of his heart in his great, strong hand when I told\r\nhim I had taken my place on the side of the Barricades, where the cause\r\nof labor must soon entrench itself. From that time I have seen him\r\nintimately at all hours of the day, under all circumstances, and found\r\nhim always sure in knowledge of the future, with unlimited faith in\r\nhumanity and never once faltering. I know unnumbered things he has done\r\nfor the “A. R. U. Boys,”—know he has gone to their personal assistance,\r\nnot only with inspiring sympathy but with substantial help. His mail\r\noften brings him words of courage and good cheer from those who have\r\ncome into the light with him, and these are the things that go deepest\r\nto his heart. He keenly suffers with the workers in all their industrial\r\nbattles, but sees now only the greater lesson to them he himself learned\r\nin the A. R. U. strike. In that strike he learned that labor was\r\npowerless with the courts, the laws, police, the military and every\r\npower of government in the hands of capital, and always ready to weaken,\r\nif not destroy, unions, unionism and union leaders. He often speaks of\r\nWoodstock jail as the greatest school where he learned to study and\r\nunderstand the value of the only weapon by which labor can ever come to\r\nits own,—“The Ballot.”\r\n\r\nHe loves to tell the stories of his childhood experiences and the\r\nexperiences of his early manhood as Town Clerk and as a member of the\r\nIndiana Legislature one term, his five years’ experience in Hulman’s\r\nWholesale Grocery House, of his joy in firing a locomotive on the\r\nVandalia Railroad, and of his grief because his aged mother could not\r\nsleep when he started out with the engine, fearing something might\r\nbefall him, and how, to make her happy, he quit the job.\r\n\r\nI find him very often, even in these days of pressing work, reading all\r\nalone to his old father, who is eighty-three years of age and almost\r\nblind. It is good to see this man, who is known in more countries and to\r\nmore human beings than any other living man, surrendering himself\r\ncompletely to his friends when they call upon him. Three weeks ago he\r\nand his comrade wife, Katherine Debs (he calls her “Kate”), came to\r\nspend the evening with my family. We had many neighbors with us and the\r\nprecise hour agreed upon “Gene” came down the street on his bicycle and\r\nwent to the kitchen and without assistance prepared the supper. You,\r\ncomrades, who have seen this man of heart and soul poised like a panther\r\nwhen he steps upon the platform and hurls the words that scorch and\r\nflash like fire, should have seen the gleam of domestic pleasure and\r\njoyous comradeship when he stood in the long apron and enthusiastically\r\ncooked a good supper in the kitchen of the “Old Red House” on Sixth\r\nStreet, where so many “Soapbox Travelers and Apostles of Truth” have\r\nfound shelter and food and repaired their raiment. And then after\r\nsupper, until after midnight, we saw his soul aflame upon his face as he\r\nrecited the wrongs of labor in Colorado and told of the heroism of the\r\noutraged comrades and workers in accursed Telluride.\r\n\r\nAgain, he loves best, I am sure, to go out into the country. We often go\r\ntogether. The last time we drove ten miles under the trees along the\r\nWabash and when his quick eye saw a Kentucky cardinal in the woods, he\r\nstopped the horse and sat listening to the clear falling notes of this\r\nsweet whistler, and when we heard a mocking bird, like a child, he\r\nclasped his hands together and was lost as long as the song lasted in\r\nworshipful adoration of the wondrous music that stirred the still\r\natmosphere into responsive vibration. After our dinner at a farmhouse we\r\nsat on a fallen “naked sycamore” on the “Banks of the Wabash,” and there\r\nI saw deeper into the soul of this great comrade and brother. The\r\nuniversality of his vision was revealed and he poured forth, as though\r\ninspired, an analysis of world conditions, a forecast of things certain\r\nto occur, that made almost the waters in the river stop, listen and\r\napplaud. He described with great particularity the Chicago Republican\r\nconvention (it was before it occurred, sometime in early May), its\r\ncertainty to be a dull, apathetic, heartless proceeding, and the St.\r\nLouis convention marking the disintegration of a great political\r\nparty,—Bryan’s dying struggle to save the Democracy and the utter\r\nimpossibility of preventing the coming together of capitalists, powers\r\nand influences, the effect upon the minds of the workers, the revelation\r\nof the true position of Capital vs. Labor and the tremendous and\r\nresistless growth of the Socialist movement. If he had had ten thousand\r\nworkers before him, he could not have uttered more polished sentences,\r\nmore words of deep significance, more prophetic epigrams than I heard\r\nalone, sitting on the fallen sycamore. But such things are not lost; he\r\nhas uttered as great things to men who seemed as trees, but some day\r\nthese same men will move as though a tornadic wind was upon them and\r\nthen they will remember when and where they heard the first great words\r\nthat inspired them.\r\n\r\nIt was near six o’clock when we came home and the toil-stained workers\r\nwere going in all directions to their cottages, huts, hovels,\r\nboat-houses and tents. I shall never forget the look of compassionate\r\nunderstanding that came into his face as he reiterated some of the\r\nthings he had so eloquently uttered in their behalf to the Wabash\r\nsycamore that afternoon, but now his words find open ears and go clear\r\nand welcome to hungry hearts. The words of this great comrade are\r\nfinding lodgment and bearing fruitage, and the time of emancipation is\r\nnot far off.\r\n\r\nYou comrades do not mistake the significance of events.\r\n\r\nI know a million men and women are alive in America today, and millions\r\nmore will soon be ready to help create the Co-operative Commonwealth,\r\nwhere men and women, great in soul and mind and strong in bodies and\r\nsure in life, shall be industrially free and realize the beneficence and\r\nuplifting power of Industrial Democracy. In that day we can know more of\r\nand better understand “Debs at Home,” for now he is tireless and\r\nliterally a wandering agitator, an apostle of truth, an awakener of the\r\ndead in spirit.\r\n\r\nWhat would humanity be without such men, produced from their longings\r\nand aspirations? When you see him, give him the best love of your heart;\r\ninspire and encourage him for yet better efforts in your behalf. His\r\nlife is of yours, ye toilers; his heart, his brain, his body, his soul\r\nare aflame with truth in your cause. Go the journey with him for your\r\nown sake. He is bone and marrow, flesh and blood of and for you. You\r\nwill not soon see his like again. There are everywhere now, in all\r\ncountries of the world, other great comrades, but nature will not soon\r\nconspire again to produce another Debs.\r\n\r\n                                                STEPHEN MARION REYNOLDS.\r\n\r\n Terre Haute, Indiana, July 28, 1908.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                WRITINGS\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MARGUERITE MARIE DEBS\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Where Daisy Sleeps\r\n\r\n          _To Mother!\r\n          Sweetest to us of all the earth.\r\n          We called her “Daisy.”_\r\n                                  Terre Haute, Ind., May, 1906\r\n\r\n                  The grass grows green\r\n                  Where Daisy sleeps;\r\n                  The Mulberry tree its vigil keeps\r\n                  Where Daisy sleeps.\r\n\r\n                  The wind blows soft\r\n                  Where Daisy sleeps;\r\n                  The modest, blue-eyed violet peeps\r\n                  Where Daisy sleeps.\r\n\r\n                  The birds sing sweet\r\n                  Where Daisy sleeps;\r\n                  The mournful willow bends and weeps\r\n                  Where Daisy sleeps.\r\n\r\n                  The sun shines bright\r\n                  Where Daisy sleeps;\r\n                  Each changing season sows and reaps\r\n                  Where Daisy sleeps.\r\n\r\n                  The flowers bloom fair\r\n                  Where Daisy sleeps;\r\n                  The evening shadow softly creeps\r\n                  Where Daisy sleeps.\r\n\r\n                  Our hearts beat true\r\n                  Where Daisy sleeps;\r\n                  And Love its watch forever keeps\r\n                  Where Daisy sleeps.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        How I Became a Socialist\r\n\r\n                    _New York Comrade, April, 1902_\r\n\r\nAs I have some doubt about the readers of “The Comrade” having any\r\ncuriosity as to “how I became a Socialist” it may be in order to say\r\nthat the subject is the editor’s, not my own; and that what is here\r\noffered is at his bidding—my only concern being that he shall not have\r\ncause to wish that I had remained what I was instead of becoming a\r\nSocialist.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of February 27, 1875, the local lodge of the Brotherhood\r\nof Locomotive Firemen was organized at Terre Haute, Ind., by Joshua A.\r\nLeach, then grand master, and I was admitted as a charter member and at\r\nonce chosen secretary. “Old Josh Leach,” as he was affectionately\r\ncalled, a typical locomotive fireman of his day, was the founder of the\r\nbrotherhood, and I was instantly attracted by his rugged honesty, simple\r\nmanner and homely speech. How well I remember feeling his large, rough\r\nhand on my shoulder, the kindly eye of an elder brother searching my own\r\nas he gently said, “My boy, you’re a little young, but I believe you’re\r\nin earnest and will make your mark in the brotherhood.” Of course, I\r\nassured him that I would do my best. What he really thought at the time\r\nflattered my boyish vanity not a little when I heard of it. He was\r\nattending a meeting at St. Louis some months later, and in the course of\r\nhis remarks said: “I put a tow-headed boy in the brotherhood at Terre\r\nHaute not long ago, and some day he will be at the head of it.”\r\n\r\nTwenty-seven years, to a day, have played their pranks with “Old Josh”\r\nand the rest of us. When last we met, not long ago, and I pressed his\r\ngood, right hand, I observed that he was crowned with the frost that\r\nnever melts; and as I think of him now:\r\n\r\n            “Remembrance wakes, with all her busy train,\r\n            Swells at my breast and turns the past to pain.”\r\n\r\nMy first step was thus taken in organized labor and a new influence\r\nfired my ambition and changed the whole current of my career. I was\r\nfilled with enthusiasm and my blood fairly leaped in my veins. Day and\r\nnight I worked for the brotherhood. To see its watchfires glow and\r\nobserve the increase of its sturdy members were the sunshine and shower\r\nof my life. To attend the “meeting” was my supreme joy, and for ten\r\nyears I was not once absent when the faithful assembled.\r\n\r\nAt the convention held in Buffalo in 1878 I was chosen associate editor\r\nof the magazine, and in 1880 I became grand secretary and treasurer.\r\nWith all the fire of youth I entered upon the crusade which seemed to\r\nfairly glitter with possibilities. For eighteen hours at a stretch I was\r\nglued to my desk reeling off the answers to my many correspondents. Day\r\nand night were one. Sleep was time wasted and often, when all oblivious\r\nof her presence in the still small hours my mother’s hand turned off the\r\nlight, I went to bed under protest. Oh, what days! And what quenchless\r\nzeal and consuming vanity! All the firemen everywhere—and they were all\r\nthe world—were straining:\r\n\r\n                         “To catch the beat\r\n                         On my tramping feet.”\r\n\r\nMy grip was always packed; and I was darting in all directions. To tramp\r\nthrough a railroad yard in the rain, snow or sleet half the night, or\r\ntill daybreak, to be ordered out of the roundhouse for being an\r\n“agitator,” or put off a train, sometimes passenger, more often freight,\r\nwhile attempting to deadhead over the division, were all in the program,\r\nand served to whet the appetite to conquer. One night in midwinter at\r\nElmira, N. Y., a conductor on the Erie kindly dropped me off in a\r\nsnowbank, and as I clambered to the top I ran into the arms of a\r\npoliceman, who heard my story and on the spot became my friend.\r\n\r\nI rode on the engines over mountain and plain, slept in the cabooses and\r\nbunks, and was fed from their pails by the swarthy stokers who still\r\nnestle close to my heart, and will until it is cold and still.\r\n\r\nThrough all these years I was nourished at Fountain Proletaire. I drank\r\ndeeply of its waters and every particle of my tissue became saturated\r\nwith the spirit of the working class. I had fired an engine and been\r\nstung by the exposure and hardship of the rail. I was with the boys in\r\ntheir weary watches, at the broken engine’s side and often helped to\r\nbear their bruised and bleeding bodies back to wife and child again. How\r\ncould I but feel the burden of their wrongs? How the seed of agitation\r\nfail to take deep root in my heart?\r\n\r\nAnd so I was spurred on in the work of organizing, not the firemen\r\nmerely, but the brakemen, switchmen, telegraphers, shopmen, track-hands,\r\nall of them in fact, and as I had now become known as an organizer, the\r\ncalls came from all sides and there are but few trades I have not helped\r\nto organize and less still in whose strikes I have not at some time had\r\na hand.\r\n\r\nIn 1894 the American Railway Union was organized and a braver body of\r\nmen never fought the battle of the working class.\r\n\r\nUp tn this time I had heard but little of Socialism, knew practically\r\nnothing about the movement, and what little I did know was not\r\ncalculated to impress me in its favor. I was bent on thorough and\r\ncomplete organization of the railroad men and ultimately the whole\r\nworking class, and all my time and energy were given to that end. My\r\nsupreme conviction was that if they were only organized in every branch\r\nof the service and all acted together in concert they could redress\r\ntheir wrongs and regulate the conditions of their employment. The\r\nstockholders of the corporation acted as one, why not the men? It was\r\nsuch a plain proposition—simply to follow the example set before their\r\neyes by their masters—surely they could not fail to see it, act as one,\r\nand solve the problem.\r\n\r\nIt is useless to say that I had yet to learn the workings of the\r\ncapitalist system, the resources of its masters and the weakness of its\r\nslaves. Indeed, no shadow of a “system” fell athwart my pathway; no\r\nthought of ending wage-misery marred my plans. I was too deeply absorbed\r\nin perfecting wage-servitude and making it a “thing of beauty and a joy\r\nforever.”\r\n\r\nIt all seems very strange to me now, taking a backward look, that my\r\nvision was so focalized on a single objective point that I utterly\r\nfailed to see what now appears as clear as the noonday sun—so clear that\r\nI marvel that any workingman, however dull, uncomprehending, can resist\r\nit.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps it was better so. I was to be baptized in Socialism in the\r\nroar of conflict and I thank the gods for reserving to this fitful\r\noccasion the fiat, “Let there be light!”—the light that streams in\r\nsteady radiance upon the broadway to the Socialist republic.\r\n\r\nThe skirmish lines of the A. R. U. were well advanced. A series of small\r\nbattles were fought and won without the loss of a man. A number of\r\nconcessions were made by the corporations rather than risk an encounter.\r\nThen came the fight on the Great Northern, short, sharp, and decisive.\r\nThe victory was complete—the only railroad strike of magnitude ever won\r\nby an organization in America.\r\n\r\nNext followed the final shock—the Pullman strike—and the American\r\nRailway Union again won, clear and complete. The combined corporations\r\nwere paralyzed and helpless. At this juncture there were delivered, from\r\nwholly unexpected quarters, a swift succession of blows that blinded me\r\nfor an instant and then opened wide my eyes—and in the gleam of every\r\nbayonet and the flash of every rifle _the class struggle was revealed_.\r\nThis was my first practical lesson in Socialism, though wholly unaware\r\nthat it was called by that name.\r\n\r\nAn army of detectives, thugs and murderers were equipped with badge and\r\nbeer and bludgeon and turned loose; old hulks of cars were fired; the\r\nalarm bells tolled; the people were terrified; the most startling rumors\r\nwere set afloat; the press volleyed and thundered, and over all the\r\nwires sped the news that Chicago’s white throat was in the clutch of a\r\nred mob; injunctions flew thick and fast, arrests followed, and our\r\noffice and headquarters, the heart of the strike, was sacked, torn out\r\nand nailed up by the “lawful” authorities of the federal government; and\r\nwhen in company with my loyal comrades I found myself in Cook county\r\njail at Chicago with the whole press screaming conspiracy, treason and\r\nmurder, and by some fateful coincidence I was given the cell occupied\r\njust previous to his execution by the assassin of Mayor Carter Harrison,\r\nSr., overlooking the spot, a few feet distant, where the anarchists were\r\nhanged a few years before, I had another exceedingly practical and\r\nimpressive lesson in Socialism.\r\n\r\nActing upon the advice of friends we sought to employ John Harlan, son\r\nof the Supreme Justice, to assist in our defense—a defense memorable to\r\nme chiefly because of the skill and fidelity of our lawyers, among whom\r\nwere the brilliant Clarence Darrow and the venerable Judge Lyman\r\nTrumbull, author of the thirteenth amendment to the constitution,\r\nabolishing slavery in the United States.\r\n\r\nMr. Harlan wanted to think of the matter over night; and the next\r\nmorning gravely informed us that he could not afford to be identified\r\nwith the case, “for,” said he, “you will be tried upon the same theory\r\nas were the anarchists, with probably the same result.” That day, I\r\nremember, the jailer, by way of consolation, I suppose, showed us the\r\nblood-stained rope used at the last execution and explained in minutest\r\ndetail, as he exhibited the gruesome relic, just how the monstrous crime\r\nof lawful murder is committed.\r\n\r\nBut the tempest gradually subsided and with it the bloodthirstiness of\r\nthe press and “public sentiment.” We were not sentenced to the gallows,\r\nnor even to the penitentiary—though put on trial for conspiracy—for\r\nreasons that will make another story.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago jail sentences were followed by six months at Woodstock and\r\nit was here that Socialism gradually laid hold of me in its own\r\nirresistible fashion. Books and pamphlets and letters from socialists\r\ncame by every mail and I began to read and think and dissect the anatomy\r\nof the system in which workingmen, however organized, could be shattered\r\nand battened and splintered at a single stroke. The writings of Bellamy\r\nand Blatchford early appealed to me. The “Cooperative Commonwealth” of\r\nGronlund also impressed me, but the writings of Kautsky were so clear\r\nand conclusive that I readily grasped, not merely his argument, but also\r\ncaught the spirit of his socialist utterance—and I thank him and all who\r\nhelped me out of darkness into light.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time, when the first glimmerings of Socialism were\r\nbeginning to penetrate, that Victor L. Berger—and I have loved him ever\r\nsince—came to Woodstock, as if a providential instrument, and delivered\r\nthe first impassioned message of Socialism I had ever heard—the very\r\nfirst to set the “wires humming in my system.” As a souvenir of that\r\nvisit there is in my library a volume of “Capital,” by Karl Marx,\r\ninscribed with the compliments of Victor L. Berger, which I cherish as a\r\ntoken of priceless value.\r\n\r\nThe American Railway Union was defeated but not conquered—overwhelmed\r\nbut not destroyed. It lives and pulsates in the Socialist movement, and\r\nits defeat but blazed the way to economic freedom and hastened the dawn\r\nof human brotherhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n               Outlook for Socialism in the United States\r\n\r\n           _International Socialist Review, September, 1900_\r\n\r\nThe sun of the passing century is setting upon scenes of extraordinary\r\nactivity in almost every part of our capitalistic old planet. Wars and\r\nrumors of wars are of universal prevalence. In the Philippines our\r\nsoldiers are civilizing and Christianizing the natives in the latest and\r\nmost approved styles of the art, and at prices ($13 per month) which\r\ncommend the blessing to the prayerful consideration of the lowly and\r\noppressed everywhere.\r\n\r\nIn South Africa the British legions axe overwhelming the Boers with\r\nvolleys of benedictions inspired by the same beautiful philanthropy in\r\nthe name of the meek and lowly Nazarene; while in China the heathen\r\nhordes, fanned into frenzy by the sordid spirit of modern commercial\r\nconquest, are presenting to the world a carnival of crime almost\r\nequaling the “refined” exhibitions of the world’s “civilized” nations.\r\n\r\nAnd through all the flame and furore of the fray can be heard the savage\r\nsnarlings of the Christian “dogs of war” as they fiercely glare about\r\nthem, and with jealous fury threaten to fly at one another’s throats to\r\nsettle the question of supremacy and the spoil and plunder of conquest.\r\n\r\nThe picture, lurid as a chamber of horrors, becomes complete in its\r\ngruesome ghastliness when robed ministers of Christ solemnly declare\r\nthat it is all for the glory of God and the advancement of Christian\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nThis, then, is the closing scene of the century as the curtain slowly\r\ndescends upon the blood-stained stage—the central figure, the pious\r\nWilhelm, Germany’s sceptered savage, issuing his imperial “spare none”\r\ndecree in the sang froid of an Apache chief—a fitting climax to the\r\nrapacious regime of the capitalist system.\r\n\r\nCheerless indeed would be the contemplation of such sanguinary scenes\r\nwere the light of Socialism not breaking upon mankind: The skies of the\r\nEast are even now aglow with the dawn; its coming is heralded by the\r\ndispelling of shadows, of darkness and gloom. From the first tremulous\r\nscintillation that gilds the horizon to the sublime march to meridian\r\nsplendor the light increases till in mighty flood it pours upon the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nFrom out of the midnight of superstition, ignorance and slavery the\r\ndisenthralling, emancipating sun is rising. I am not gifted with\r\nprophetic vision, and yet I see the shadows vanishing. I behold near and\r\nfar prostrate men lifting their bowed forms from the dust. I see thrones\r\nin the grasp of decay; despots relaxing their hold upon scepters, and\r\nshackles falling, not only from the limbs, but from the souls of men.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore with pleasure that I respond to the invitation of the\r\neditor of the International Socialist Review to present my views upon\r\nthe “Outlook for Socialism in the United States.” Socialists generally\r\nwill agree that the past year has been marked with a propaganda of\r\nunprecedented activity and that the sentiment of the American people in\r\nrespect to Socialism has undergone a most remarkable change. It would be\r\ndifficult to imagine a more ignorant, bitter and unreasoning prejudice\r\nthan that of the American people against Socialism during the early\r\nyears of its introduction by the propagandists from the other side.\r\n\r\nI never think of these despised and persecuted “foreign invaders”\r\nwithout a feeling of profound obligation, akin to reverence, for their\r\nnoble work in laying the foundations deep and strong, under the most\r\ntrying conditions, of the American movement. The ignorant mass, wholly\r\nincapable of grasping their splendid teachings or appreciating their\r\nlofty motives, reviled against them. The press inoculated the public\r\nsentiment with intolerance and malice which not infrequently found\r\nexpression through the policeman’s club when a few of the pioneers\r\ngathered to engraft the class-conscious doctrine upon their inhospitable\r\n“free-born” American fellow citizens.\r\n\r\nSocialism was cunningly associated with “anarchy and bloodshed,” and\r\ndenounced as a “foul foreign importation” to pollute the fair, free soil\r\nof America, and every outrage to which the early agitators were\r\nsubjected won the plaudits of the people. But they persevered in their\r\ntask; they could not be silenced or suppressed. Slowly they increased in\r\nnumber and gradually the movement began to take root and spread over the\r\ncountry. The industrial conditions consequent upon the development of\r\ncapitalist production were now making themselves felt and Socialism\r\nbecame a fixed and increasing factor in the economic and political\r\naffairs of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe same difficulties which other countries had experienced in the\r\nprocess of party organization have attended the development of the\r\nmovement here, but these differences, which relate mainly to tactics and\r\nmethods of propaganda, are bound to disappear as the friction of the\r\njarring factions smoothens out the rough edges and adjusts them to a\r\nconcrete body—a powerful section in the great international army of\r\nmilitant Socialism.\r\n\r\nIn the general elections of 1898 upwards of 91,000 votes were cast for\r\nthe Socialist candidates in the United States, an increase in this “off\r\nyear” of almost two hundred per cent over the general elections of two\r\nyears previous, the presidential year of 1896. Since the congressional\r\nelections of 1898, and more particularly since the municipal and state\r\nelections following, which resulted in such signal victories in\r\nMassachusetts, two members of the legislature and a mayor, the first in\r\nAmerica, being elected by decided majorities—since then Socialism has\r\nmade rapid strides in all directions and the old politicians no longer\r\nreckon it as a negative quantity in making their forecasts and\r\ncalculating their pluralities and majorities.\r\n\r\nThe subject has passed entirely beyond the domain of sneer and ridicule\r\nand now commands serious treatment. Of course, Socialism is violently\r\ndenounced by the capitalist press and by all the brood of subsidized\r\ncontributors to magazine literature, but this only confirms the view\r\nthat the advance of Socialism is very properly recognized by the\r\ncapitalist class as the one cloud upon the horizon which portends an end\r\nto the system in which they have waxed fat, insolent and despotic\r\nthrough the exploitation of their countless wage-working slaves.\r\n\r\nIn school and college and church, in clubs and public halls everywhere,\r\nSocialism is the central theme of discussion, and its advocates,\r\ninspired by its noble principles, are to be found here, there and in all\r\nplaces ready to give or accept challenge to battle. In the cities the\r\ncorner meetings are popular and effective. But rarely is such a\r\ngathering now molested by the “authorities,” and then only where they\r\nhave just been inaugurated. They are too numerously attended by serious,\r\nintelligent and self-reliant men and women to invite interference.\r\n\r\nAgitation is followed by organization, and the increase of branches,\r\nsections and clubs goes forward with extraordinary activity in every\r\npart of the land.\r\n\r\nIn New England the agitation has resulted in quite a general\r\norganization among the states, with Massachusetts in the lead; and the\r\nindications are that, with the vigorous prosecution of the campaign\r\nalready inaugurated, a tremendous increase in the vote will be polled in\r\nthe approaching national elections. New York and Pennsylvania will show\r\nsurprising socialist returns, while Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois,\r\nMissouri and Kentucky will all round up with a large vote. Wisconsin has\r\nalready a great vote to her credit and will increase it largely this\r\nyear. In the west and northwest, Kansas, Iowa and Minnesota will forge\r\nto the front, and so also will Nebraska, the Dakotas, Montana, Oregon,\r\nWashington, Idaho and Colorado. California is expected to show an\r\nimmense increase, and the returns from there will not disappoint the\r\nmost sanguine. In the southwest, Texas is making a stirring campaign,\r\nand several papers, heretofore Populist, will support our candidates and\r\nswell the socialist vote, which will be an eyeopener when announced.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the situation could scarcely be more favorable and the\r\nfinal returns will more than justify our sanguine expectations.\r\n\r\nIt must not be overlooked, however, when calculations are made, that\r\nthis is a presidential year and that the general results will not be so\r\nfavorable as if the elections were in an “off year.” Both the Republican\r\nand Democratic parties will, as usual, strain every nerve to whip the\r\n“voting kings” into line and every conceivable influence will be exerted\r\nto that end. These vast machines operate with marvelous precision and\r\nthe wheels are already in motion. Corruption funds, national, state and\r\nmunicipal, will flow out like lava tides; promises will be as plentiful\r\nas autumn leaves; from ten thousand platforms the Columbian orator will\r\nagitate the atmosphere, while brass bands, torchlight processions,\r\nglittering uniforms and free whisky, dispensed by the “ward-heeler,”\r\nwill lend their combined influence to steer the “patriots” to the\r\ncapitalist chute that empties into the ballot box.\r\n\r\nThe campaign this year will be unusually spectacular. The Republican\r\nparty “points with pride” to the “prosperity” of the country, the\r\nbeneficent results of the “gold standard” and the “war record” of the\r\nadministration. The Democratic party declares that “imperialism” is the\r\n“paramount” issue, and that the country is certain to go to the\r\n“demnition bow-wows” if Democratic officeholders are not elected instead\r\nof the Republicans. The Democratic slogan is “The Republic vs. the\r\nEmpire,” accompanied in a very minor key by 16 to 1 and “direct\r\nlegislation where practical.”\r\n\r\nBoth these capitalist parties are fiercely opposed to trusts, though\r\nwhat they propose to do with them is not of sufficient importance to\r\nrequire even a hint in their platforms.\r\n\r\nNeedless is it for me to say to the thinking workingman that he has no\r\nchoice between these two capitalist parties, that they are both pledged\r\nto the same system and that whether the one or the other succeeds, he\r\nwill still remain the wage-working slave he is today.\r\n\r\nWhat but meaningless phrases are “imperialism,” “expansion,” “free\r\nsilver,” “gold standard,” etc., to the wage-worker? The large\r\ncapitalists represented by Mr. McKinley and the small capitalists\r\nrepresented by Mr. Bryan are interested in these “issues,” but they do\r\nnot concern the working class.\r\n\r\nWhat the workingmen of the country are profoundly interested in is the\r\nprivate ownership of the means of production and distribution, the\r\nenslaving and degrading wage-system in which they toil for a pittance at\r\nthe pleasure of their masters and are bludgeoned, jailed or shot when\r\nthey protest—this is the central, controlling, vital issue of the hour,\r\nand neither of the old party platforms has a word or even a hint about\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, large capitalists are Republicans and small capitalists are\r\nDemocrats, but workingmen must remember that they are all capitalists,\r\nand that the many small ones, like the fewer large ones, are all\r\npolitically supporting their class interests, and this is always and\r\neverywhere the capitalist class.\r\n\r\nWhether the means of production—that is to say, the land, mines,\r\nfactories, machinery, etc.—are owned by a few large Republican\r\ncapitalists, who organize a trust, or whether they be owned by a lot of\r\nsmall Democratic capitalists, who are opposed to the trust, is all the\r\nsame to the working class. Let the capitalists, large and small, fight\r\nthis out among themselves.\r\n\r\nThe working class must get rid of the whole brood of masters and\r\nexploiters, and put themselves in possession and control of the means of\r\nproduction, that they may have steady employment without consulting a\r\ncapitalist employer, large or small, and that they may get the wealth\r\ntheir labor produces, all of it, and enjoy with their families the\r\nfruits of their industry in comfortable and happy homes, abundant and\r\nwholesome food, proper clothing and all other things necessary to “life,\r\nliberty and the pursuit of happiness.” It is therefore a question not of\r\n“reform,” the mask of fraud, but of revolution. The capitalist system\r\nmust be overthrown, class-rule abolished and wage-slavery supplanted by\r\ncoöperative industry.\r\n\r\nWe hear it frequently urged that the Democratic party is the “poor man’s\r\nparty,” “the friend of labor.” There is but one way to relieve poverty\r\nand to free labor, and that is by making common property of the tools of\r\nlabor.\r\n\r\nIs the Democratic party, which we are assured has “strong socialistic\r\ntendencies,” in favor of collective ownership of the means of\r\nproduction? Is it opposed to the wage-system, from which flows in a\r\nceaseless stream the poverty, misery and wretchedness of the children of\r\ntoil? If the Democratic party is the “friend of labor” any more than the\r\nRepublican party, why is its platform dumb in the presence of Cœur\r\nd’Alene? It knows the truth about these shocking outrages—crimes upon\r\nworkingmen, their wives and children, which would blacken the pages of\r\nSiberia—why does it not speak out?\r\n\r\nWhat has the Democratic party to say about the “property and educational\r\nqualifications” in North Carolina and Louisiana, and the proposed\r\ngeneral disfranchisement of the negro race in the southern states?\r\n\r\nThe differences between the Republican and Democratic parties involve no\r\nissue, no principle in which the working class have any interest, and\r\nwhether the spoils be distributed by Hanna and Platt, or by Croker and\r\nTammany Hall is all the same to them.\r\n\r\nBetween these parties socialists have no choice, no preference. They are\r\none in their opposition to Socialism, that is to say, the emancipation\r\nof the working class from wage-slavery, and every workingman who has\r\nintelligence enough to understand the interest of his class and the\r\nnature of the struggle in which it is involved, will once and for all\r\ntime sever his relations with them both; and recognizing the\r\nclass-struggle which is being waged between producing workers and\r\nnon-producing capitalists, cast his lot with the class-conscious,\r\nrevolutionary Socialist party, which is pledged to abolish the\r\ncapitalist system, class-rule and wage-slavery—a party which does not\r\ncompromise or fuse, but, preserving inviolate the principles which\r\nquickened it into life and now give it vitality and force, moves forward\r\nwith dauntless determination to the goal of economic freedom.\r\n\r\nThe political trend is steadily toward Socialism. The old parties are\r\nheld together only by the cohesive power of spoils, and in spite of this\r\nthey are steadily disintegrating. Again and again they have been tried\r\nwith the same results, and thousands upon thousands, awake to their\r\nduplicity, are deserting them and turning toward Socialism as the only\r\nrefuge and security. Republicans, Democrats, Populists, Prohibitionists,\r\nSingle Taxers are having their eyes opened to the true nature of the\r\nstruggle and they are beginning to\r\n\r\n                     “Come as the winds come, when\r\n                       Forests are rended;\r\n                     Come as the waves come, when\r\n                       Navies are stranded.”\r\n\r\nFor a time the Populist party had a mission, but it is practically\r\nended. The Democratic party has “fused” it out of existence. The\r\n“middle-of-the-road” element will be sorely disappointed when the votes\r\nare counted, and they will probably never figure in another national\r\ncampaign. Not many of them will go back to the old parties. Many of them\r\nhave already come to Socialism, and the rest are sure to follow.\r\n\r\nThere is no longer any room for a Populist party, and progressive\r\nPopulists realize it, and hence the “strongholds” of Populism are\r\nbecoming the “hot-beds” of Socialism.\r\n\r\nIt is simply a question of capitalism or socialism, of despotism or\r\ndemocracy, and they who are not wholly with us are wholly against us.\r\n\r\nAnother source of strength to Socialism, steadily increasing, is the\r\ntrades-union movement. The spread of Socialist doctrine among the labor\r\norganizations of the country during the past year exceeds the most\r\nextravagant estimates. No one has had better opportunities than the\r\nwriter to note the transition to Socialism among trades-unionists, and\r\nthe approaching election will abundantly verify it.\r\n\r\nPromising, indeed, is the outlook for Socialism in the United States.\r\nThe very contemplation of the prospect is a well-spring of inspiration.\r\n\r\nOh, that all the working class could and would use their eyes and see;\r\ntheir ears and hear; their brains and think. How soon this earth could\r\nbe transformed and by the alchemy of social order made to blossom with\r\nbeauty and joy.\r\n\r\nNo sane man can be satisfied with the present system. If a poor man is\r\nhappy, said Victor Hugo, “he is the pick-pocket of happiness. Only the\r\nrich and noble are happy by right. The rich man is he who, being young,\r\nhas the rights of old age; being old, the lucky chances of youth;\r\nvicious, the respect of good people; a coward, the command of the\r\nstout-hearted; doing nothing, the fruits of labor.” * * *\r\n\r\nWith pride and joy we watch each advancing step of our comrades in\r\nSocialism in all other lands. Our hearts are with them in their varying\r\nfortunes as the battle proceeds, and we applaud each telling blow\r\ndelivered and cheer each victory achieved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  DEBS, HIS FATHER AND BROTHER\r\n\r\n  (See Page 58)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe wire has just brought the tidings of Liebknecht’s death. The hearts\r\nof American Socialists will be touched and shocked by the calamity. The\r\nbrave old warrior succumbed at last, but not until he heard the tramp of\r\nInternational Socialism, for which he labored with all his loving, loyal\r\nheart; not until he saw the thrones of Europe, one by one, begin to\r\ntotter, not until he had achieved a glorious immortality.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         The American Movement\r\n\r\nThe twentieth century, according to the prophecy of Victor Hugo, is to\r\nbe the century of humanity.\r\n\r\nIn all the procession of centuries gone, not one was for humanity. From\r\nthe very first tyranny has flourished, freedom has failed; the few have\r\nruled, the many have served; the parasite has worn the purple of power,\r\nwhile honest industry has lived in poverty and died in despair.\r\n\r\nBut the eternal years, the centuries yet to come, are for humanity and\r\nout of the misery of the past will rise the civilization of the future.\r\n\r\nThe nineteenth century evolved the liberating and humanizing movement;\r\nthe twentieth century will witness its culmination in the crash of\r\ndespotism and the rise of world-wide democracy, freedom and brotherhood.\r\n\r\nIt was while in exile, in 1864, that Hugo wrote:\r\n\r\n“The transformation of the crowd into the people—profound task! It is to\r\nthis labor that the men called Socialists have devoted themselves during\r\nthe last forty years. The author of this book, however insignificant he\r\nmay be, is one of the oldest in this labor. If he claims his place among\r\nthese philosophers, it is because it is a place of persecution. A\r\ncertain hatred of Socialism, very blind, but very general, has raged for\r\nfifteen or sixteen years, and is still raging most bitterly among the\r\ninfluential classes. Let it not be forgotten that true Socialism has for\r\nits end the elevation of the masses to the civic dignity, and that,\r\ntherefore, the principal care is for moral and intellectual\r\ncultivation.”\r\n\r\nIf, as we are quite ready to believe, the twentieth century realizes the\r\nprophecy of the French poet and “bursts full-blossomed on the thorny\r\nstem of time,” as the century of humanity, it will be the denouement of\r\nthe socialist agitation that began in the preceding century—the fruition\r\nof the international socialist movement.\r\n\r\nIn the closing years of the last century, following in the wake of the\r\nFrench revolution, the tendencies in Europe were unmistakably toward\r\nwhat has since developed into modern socialism. Of course the early\r\nstages were nebulous and vague, and the trend was not yet strongly\r\nmarked or clearly disclosed.\r\n\r\nBut as the inventive genius of man asserted itself in the industrial\r\nworld; as the use of steam as motive power expanded and machinery was\r\nintroduced and its application to industry became more general, with its\r\ninevitable effects upon artisans, laborers and small tradesmen, the\r\nmovement was accelerated in varying forms, chiefly utopian, until many\r\nyears afterward, toward the middle of the nineteenth century, when it\r\nwas crystallized by the genius of Marx, Engels, Lassalle and others, who\r\ncaught the revolutionary current, clarified it and sent it circling\r\naround the globe on its mission of freedom and fraternity.\r\n\r\nThe earliest traces of socialism in the United States had their origin\r\nin the stream of immigration that flowed from the old world to the new\r\nand bore upon its bosom the germs of discontent warmed into life in the\r\neffete feudalism of European civilization.\r\n\r\nWe shall not here undertake to chronicle the many attempts, covering\r\nmore than half a century, or until about 1840, to spread socialism or\r\nsemi-socialistic doctrine among the American people and thus turn the\r\ntide of labor agitation in that direction. The times were fruitful of\r\nindustrial and social unrest and the many schemes and plans that were\r\nproposed, utopian, impractical, impossible though they undoubtedly were,\r\nwere at the same time the signs and symptoms of social gestation, the\r\nfore-runners of the mighty change that was laying hold of governments\r\nand institutions and destined to revolutionize them all and level the\r\nhuman race upward to the plane of an all-embracing civilization.\r\n\r\nAlmost eighty years ago Robert Owen, dreamer, enthusiast and\r\nhumanitarian, came from England to America, to make the new continent\r\nblossom with utopian splendor. His series of experiments in communism,\r\ndoomed to disappointment and failure, are an interesting study in the\r\nearly years of the American movement; and although in the light of our\r\npresent knowledge of industrial evolution his undertaking may seem\r\nvisionary and foolish to some, he rendered invaluable service in\r\nclearing away the brush and dispelling the fog; and the history of\r\nSocialism cannot be written without his name.\r\n\r\nDecidedly less utopian and more practical and promising were the\r\ndevelopments in the forties when what is known as Fourierism played its\r\ninteresting and historic role in America.\r\n\r\nMany of the most intellectual men and women of the day were attracted to\r\nthe movement.\r\n\r\nThe most ardent enthusiasm seized the devotees and they set to work with\r\nhand and heart to convert the American wilderness into the promised land\r\nof milk and honey.\r\n\r\nOf course the dominant strain was emotional and sympathetic, but there\r\nwas nevertheless a solid sub-stratum of scientific soundness in the\r\nundertaking, as is proved conclusively by the writings of the men who so\r\nheartily gave it support.\r\n\r\nBrook Farm, a beautiful reminiscence, tinged with disappointment, was\r\nfounded near Boston in 1841. Among the many illustrious names associated\r\nwith Brook Farm the following have peculiar interest after sixty years:\r\nGeorge Ripley, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Horace Greeley, James Russell\r\nLowell, John Greenleaf Whittier, William Cullen Bryant, Albert Brisbane,\r\nEllery Channing, James Freeman Clarke, Theodore Parker, A. Bronson\r\nAlcott, John Thomas Codman, Henry D. Thoreau, Nathaniel Hawthorne,\r\nGeorge Bancroft, Charles A. Dana and George William Curtis.\r\n\r\nThe Brook Farm Association, organized by “intellectuals” who had no\r\nknowledge of the laws of economic determinism or of the historic\r\nevolution of society, was ideal in conception and breathed the air of\r\nequality and brotherhood.\r\n\r\nThe association declared its object to be “a radical and universal\r\nreform, rather than to redress any particular wrong. * * *”\r\n\r\nIn the “preliminary statement” the members announced that the work they\r\nhad undertaken was not a “mere resolution, but a necessary step in the\r\nprogress which no one can be blind enough to think has yet reached its\r\nlimit.”\r\n\r\nThey said, furthermore: “We believe that humanity, trained by these long\r\ncenturies of suffering and struggle, led on by so many saints and heroes\r\nand sages, is at length prepared to enter into that universal order\r\ntoward which it has perpetually moved.”\r\n\r\n“Thus * * * we declare that the imperative duty of this time and this\r\ncountry, nay, more, that its only salvation and the salvation of\r\ncivilized countries, lies in the reorganization of society according to\r\nthe unchanging laws of human nature and of universal harmony.”\r\n\r\nThese passages are indicative of a clear perception for that time and\r\nwould require but little remodeling to adapt them for incorporation into\r\na modern scientific socialist platform.\r\n\r\nThe closing paragraph, which follows, is worthy to be preserved in\r\nsocialist literature. It voices in lofty strain the conviction of the\r\nBrook Farmers in the ultimate realization of their hope for something\r\nlike a co-operative commonwealth.\r\n\r\nThey say: “And whatever may be the result of any special efforts, we can\r\nnever doubt that the object we have in view shall be finally attained;\r\nthat human life shall yet be developed, not in discord and misery, but\r\nin harmony and joy, and that the perfected earth shall at last bear on\r\nher bosom a race of men worthy of the name.”\r\n\r\nThis was written in January, 1844, and the whole document bears evidence\r\nof socialistic thought and tendencies.\r\n\r\nRalph Waldo Emerson wrote: “And truly, I honor the generous ideas of the\r\nsocialists, the magnificence of their theories, and the enthusiasm with\r\nwhich they have been urged.”\r\n\r\nAlbert Brisbane, Parke Godwin and Horace Greeley, the latter unique and\r\nin some respects the most clear-sighted and practical of them all, were\r\ncommanding figures in that day.\r\n\r\nAll of them had human blood in their veins—all had democratic instincts\r\nand perceived more or less clearly the drift of the time, the tendency\r\ntoward collective society, industrial freedom and social justice.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Marx and his coadjutors were clearing the murky\r\natmosphere of the old world. They were dissecting the prevailing mode of\r\nproduction and capitalist society in general and in their researches\r\ndiscovered the fundamental law of social development in the\r\n“materialistic conception of history,” the scientific basis of socialist\r\nthought and activity throughout the world.\r\n\r\nFrom this time forward the working class movement had a scientific\r\nfoundation, the scattered and contentious factions were gradually united\r\nand harmonized, and socialism became a distinct and recognized factor in\r\nthe industrial and political destiny of the race.\r\n\r\nFollowing the example and taking inspiration from the pioneers of the\r\nold world, and re-enforced by the socialists who crossed the water and\r\nat once began the proselyting inherent in the revolutionary spirit, the\r\nAmericans took heart; they entered upon their labors with renewed zeal,\r\nscattered the seed of socialist philosophy and it struck root in\r\nAmerican soil.\r\n\r\nAlbert Brisbane was one of the commanding figures in inspiring and\r\ndirecting the American movement. He was a pronounced socialist and as\r\nearly as 1840 set forth his views in a volume entitled “Social Destiny\r\nof Man: or Association and Reorganization of Industry.”\r\n\r\nIn this work Brisbane made a strong plea and cogent argument in favor of\r\nco-operative industry and “an equitable distribution of profits to each\r\nindividual.”\r\n\r\nGoing to Europe in 1848, Brisbane for the first time met Karl Marx at\r\nCologne, of whom he afterward wrote as follows: “I found there Karl\r\nMarx, the leader of the popular movement. The writings of Marx on Labor\r\nand Capital and the Social theories he then elaborated have had more\r\ninfluence on the great Socialistic movement of Europe than that of any\r\nother man. He it was who laid the foundation of that modern collectivism\r\nwhich at present bids fair to become the leading Socialist doctrine of\r\nEurope. He was then just rising into prominence; a man of some thirty\r\nyears, short, solidly built, with a fine face and bushy black hair. His\r\nexpression was that of great energy, and behind his self-contained\r\nreserve of manner were visible the fire and passion of a great soul. * *\r\n* * * * *”\r\n\r\n“Briefly stated, as represented by the collectivism of today, his\r\ndoctrine demands the abolition of individual ownership of the natural\r\nwealth of the world—the soil, the mines, the inventions and creations of\r\nindustry which are the means of production, as well as of the machinery\r\nof the world. This wealth, furnished by nature or created by the genius\r\nof humanity, is to be made collective property, held by the state\r\n(collectively) for the equal advantage of the whole body of the people.\r\nGovernments are to represent the collective intelligence of the nation;\r\nto manage, direct and supervise all general operations and relations of\r\nan industrial character. * * *”\r\n\r\nBrisbane traveled extensively in Europe, met the men of note in the\r\nprincipal countries, and studied the industrial and social conditions\r\nwith a view to propagating the collectivist movement in the United\r\nStates. On his return, filled with the spirit of enthusiasm, he\r\nvigorously entered upon his work of agitation and is fairly entitled to\r\nthe credit of having rendered great service in the pioneer work of\r\nstarting the Socialist movement in America.\r\n\r\nWithout desire to disparage any of the men of that time by invidious\r\ncomparison, the immense personality and rustic simplicity, coupled with\r\nthe keen perception, rugged honesty and intense earnestness of Horace\r\nGreeley, command special admiration.\r\n\r\nThe power of Greeley’s influence in the early history of the Socialist\r\nmovement in America, when hate and persecution were aroused by the mere\r\nmention of it, has never yet been fairly recognized. He has been called\r\n“our later Franklin” and deserves the title.\r\n\r\nParton, the biographer of Greeley, said: “The subject of Greeley’s\r\noratory is one alone; it is ever the same; the object of his public life\r\nis single. It is the ‘_Emancipation of Labor_,’ its emancipation from\r\nignorance, vice, servitude, insecurity, poverty. This is his chosen,\r\nonly theme, whether he speaks from the platform or writes for the\r\nTribune.”\r\n\r\nHorace Greeley was in the true sense a _Labor Leader_. He was the first\r\npresident of Typographical Union No. 6 of New York City and took\r\nadvanced ground on every question that affected the working class.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing conservative about the views of Greeley on the labor\r\nquestion. He was, above all else, radical and progressive, that is to\r\nsay, revolutionary, and the labor leaders of today could with credit to\r\nthemselves and benefit to their organizations study his character and\r\nwritings and follow his example.\r\n\r\nThe upheaval in Europe in 1848 forced many of the radicals and\r\nSocialists into exile; and the general tide that set in toward the\r\nwestern world bore many of these restless spirits to our shores; and no\r\nsooner were they landed before they began to sow the revolutionary seed\r\nand organize the propaganda they had been compelled to abandon on the\r\nother side.\r\n\r\nThe German Socialists who came over were the very men needed here at\r\nthat time. They were trained and disciplined in the “old guard”; they\r\nhad the rugged bearing and fearlessness of army veterans and they knew\r\nno such word as discouragement or failure.\r\n\r\nAmong these sturdy agitators William Weitling bore a conspicuous part in\r\npreparing the way for organization and for action along political lines.\r\n\r\nFrom this time the propaganda became more active and also clearer and\r\nmore definite in character.\r\n\r\nThe movement was gradually evolving from the haze of communism that\r\nclung to it through all its early years and was beginning to take form\r\nas an independent political organization with the central object of\r\nconquering the powers of government as a means of emancipating the\r\nworking class from wage-slavery.\r\n\r\nLabor unions, turner bunds and singing societies were organized all\r\nthrough the fifties, all tending in the same direction, and though not\r\nall pronounced, having substantially the same end in view.\r\n\r\nIn this brief sketch we have not the space to record in detail the many\r\nattempts that were made to organize a national working class political\r\nmovement in the United States. This must be the work of the historian\r\nand fortunately for the reader and student he has recently appeared. The\r\nfirst authentic volume upon the subject is the “History of Socialism in\r\nthe United States,” by Morris Hillquit, a book of over three hundred and\r\nfifty pages, written in excellent style and treating ably and\r\nexhaustively the various stages of the development from its inception to\r\nthe large and growing movement of our day.\r\n\r\nThe little volume entitled “A Brief History of Socialism in America,” by\r\nFrederic Heath, editor of the _Social Democratic Herald_, a valuable\r\ncollection of historical data to which has been added much original\r\nmatter, both interesting and instructive, is also well worthy of\r\nperusal.\r\n\r\nProfessor Richard T. Ely, in his “Labor Movement in America,” discussing\r\nthe “Beginnings of Modern Socialism,” says in reference to the period we\r\nare now considering: “The Socialism of today may be said to date from\r\nthe European revolutions of 1848, all of which soon terminated\r\ndisastrously for the people as opposed to their rulers. Many German\r\nrefugees sought our shores, and some of them were ardent Socialists and\r\nCommunists, who endeavored to propagate their ideas. Wilhelm Weitling, a\r\ntailor, born in Magdeburg in 1808, was prominent among these” * * * and\r\n“became one of the first to scatter those seeds of economic radicalism\r\nwhich have brought forth such large increase in the social democracy of\r\nour own times.” * * *\r\n\r\n“The first large society to adopt and propagate Socialism in America was\r\ncomposed of the German Gymnastic Unions (Turnvereine). The Socialistic\r\nTurnvereine of New York drew up a constitution for an association, to be\r\ncomposed of the various local gymnastic unions, and published it in\r\n1850. A preliminary gathering of a few delegates was held in New York in\r\nthe Shakespeare Hotel, then the headquarters of the ‘progressive’\r\nelements among the Germans. It was finally decided to call a meeting of\r\ndelegates, to be held in Philadelphia, on October 5th of the same year,\r\nto effect a permanent organization. Several Turnvereine acted on the\r\nsuggestion, and among others, delegates were present from New York,\r\nBoston and Baltimore. The first name adopted was ‘Associated Gymnastic\r\nUnions of North America,’ which was, however, changed the following year\r\nto ‘Socialist Gymnastic Union.’”\r\n\r\nThrough the sixties and seventies the agitation steadily increased,\r\nlocal organizations were formed in various parts of the country, but\r\nthey were chiefly for the passing day and after serving their temporary\r\npurpose, disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe American Civil War and the emancipation of the negro race which\r\nfollowed, resulting in millions of “free” negroes being thrown upon the\r\n“labor market,” had its effect in developing capitalist production.\r\n\r\nThe years following the war marked an era of extraordinary industrial\r\nand commercial activity. Inventive genius was taxed to provide machinery\r\nand the power necessary to operate it in factory, mill and mine.\r\nManufacturing developed at an enormous rate. The railroads were\r\npenetrating the great west and the population spread over the vast\r\ndomain.\r\n\r\nThen came the symptoms of congestion, the glutted markets and the\r\nclogging of productive machinery.\r\n\r\nThe “good times” had come to a sudden end; factories and workshops\r\nclosed down; railroads reduced wages and discharged thousands.\r\n\r\nThe country swarmed with unemployed workingmen; everybody was ominously\r\ndiscussing the “panic” and the “hard times.”\r\n\r\nDiscontent was brewing and strikes were threatened by the idle workers.\r\n\r\nThe railroad strikes and many others broke out in the financial crisis\r\nof 1873.\r\n\r\nIt was a period of financial bankruptcy, industrial stagnation and\r\ngeneral gloom.\r\n\r\nThe sheriff’s hammer was heard everywhere beating the dolorous funeral\r\nmarches of departed prosperity.\r\n\r\nIt was during this panic that the “tramp” era was inaugurated in the\r\nUnited States and the tramp became a recognized factor in our social\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThe trades-union movement had organized rapidly during the years of\r\nindustrial prosperity. Many of the trades had formed national\r\norganizations and when the crash came, the strikes followed in rapid\r\norder.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1877, the railroad strikes, supported by the railroad\r\nbrotherhoods, notably the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and\r\nBrotherhood of Locomotive Firemen, waged with intense severity and\r\nresulting in widespread rioting, bloodshed and destruction of property,\r\nspread over a vast area of the country and threatened the direst\r\nconsequences if the grievances of the strikers were not adjusted.\r\n\r\nThis was among the first strikes in which the writer had an active part\r\nand many incidents and scenes are remembered which would make an\r\ninteresting chapter of proletarian history.\r\n\r\nThe stories of these strikes were written by Allan Pinkerton, the\r\ndetective, in a curious volume entitled “Strikers, Communists, Tramps\r\nand Detectives.” The volume has the portrait of the late P. M. Arthur,\r\ngrand chief of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, who was then\r\nregarded as a radical labor agitator, as the frontispiece. It also\r\ncontains a complete expose of the brotherhood, illustrated with diagrams\r\nand including its ceremony of initiation, signs, passwords and all of\r\nits secret inner workings.\r\n\r\nThe strikes spread rapidly east and west and were followed by rioting\r\nand violence in most of the railroad centers. The Pittsburg riots were\r\nthe most disastrous in the loss of life and destruction of property. In\r\nhis account of it, colored to suit the capitalistic interests he\r\nrepresented, Allan Pinkerton, describing the charge of the militia upon\r\nthe mob, says:\r\n\r\n“Suddenly a little puff of smoke shot out from a second story window,\r\nfollowed by a ringing report and a quick cry from a soldier who had been\r\nstruck, but not dangerously wounded.”\r\n\r\n“Back along the column came the officers, exhorting the men to be\r\npatient and not return the fire.\r\n\r\n“The speed of the troops increased. The energy of the mob redoubled. The\r\npistol-shot from the window seemed almost a signal, for instantly\r\nafterwards, from along the crowd’s front, several more shots were fired,\r\nand but a few minutes more had elapsed until from behind every\r\nlamp-post, over every hydrant head, and from out every door and window,\r\nshot the flame, shot the smoke, the flame and the bullets.\r\n\r\n“Soldiers fell; and now their comrades returned the fire, while, as in\r\nevery other instance, the disorganized, howling mob received far the\r\nworst punishment. Some of the wounded soldiers would escape with their\r\nlives through the devices, and at the personal risk, of humane people\r\nalong the street who gave them help and shelter. Others, not so\r\nfortunate, were heartlessly murdered when too helpless for defense.” * *\r\n*\r\n\r\n“At one point where a good deal of killing had been done the previous\r\nday, and where a building at the corner of the streets not only was\r\ncompletely riddled with bullets, but bore evidence of the earnest\r\nefforts in behalf of religion by the Young Men’s Christian Association\r\nin the shape of a poster upon which was placarded the startling warning:\r\n‘PREPARE TO MEET THY GOD.’”\r\n\r\nThe strikes were finally crushed out and the leaders driven out and\r\nblacklisted.\r\n\r\nIt was in this struggle that the powers of the federal courts were first\r\ninvoked to break a railroad strike. The strike leaders and committees\r\nwere arrested by order of the federal judges, sitting at Indianapolis,\r\nInd., and committed to jail upon various trumped up charges.\r\n\r\nThe late President Benjamin Harrison had the exclusive distinction of\r\nhaving served the railway corporations in the dual capacity of lawyer\r\nand soldier. He prosecuted the strikers in the federal courts, securing\r\nprison sentences for them, and he also organized and commanded a company\r\nof soldiers during the strike, and made speeches denouncing the\r\nstrikers.\r\n\r\nTen years later he was elevated to the presidency of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe loss of the strike was a staggering blow to organized labor, and\r\nmany unions passed out of existence. Upon the railroads the mere\r\nsuspicion of belonging to a union was sufficient ground for instant\r\ndischarge.\r\n\r\nIn time, however, the ban was removed, the corporations feeling\r\nthemselves the masters of the situation, and with returning financial\r\nand industrial activity, the work of organization was resumed with\r\ngreater energy and determination than ever before.\r\n\r\nIn the events that followed swiftly during these years it will be noted\r\nthat the United States had become entirely Europeanized in respect to\r\nthe suppression of exploited and discontented workingmen.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to observe in this connection that capitalism\r\nis the same everywhere, that like causes produce like results.\r\n\r\nWherever capitalism appears, in pursuit of its mission of exploitation,\r\nthere will Socialism, fertilized by misery, watered by tears, and\r\nvitalized by agitation be also found, unfurling its class-struggle\r\nbanner and proclaiming its mission of emancipation.\r\n\r\nDuring all of these years of strikes and strife, of occasional victory\r\nand frequent defeat for labor, the Socialist agitation was kept up as\r\nfar as conditions and means would allow. Under the most unfavorable\r\ncircumstances the comrades did what they could, held their ground and\r\npatiently waited for a more favorable turn in the situation.\r\n\r\nFollowing the Paris Commune in 1871, and its tragic ending, many French\r\nradicals came to our shores and gave new spirit to the movement.\r\nReferring to these Professor Ely in his “Labor Movement in America,”\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n“In 1871 a new impulse was received from the French refugees who came to\r\nAmerica after the suppression of the uprising of the commune in Paris,\r\nand brought with them a spirit of violence, but a more important event\r\nin this early period was the order of the congress of the International\r\nheld in the Hague in 1872, which transferred to New York the ‘General\r\nCouncil’ of the association. Modern Socialism had then undoubtedly begun\r\nto exist in America. The first proclamation of the Council from their\r\nnew headquarters was an appeal to the workingmen ‘to emancipate labor\r\nand eradicate all international and national strife.’”\r\n\r\n“In the spring of 1872 ‘an imposing demonstration’ in favor of eight\r\nhours took place in New York City. The paper before me estimates the\r\nnumber of those taking part in the procession through the principal\r\nstreets at twenty thousand, and among the other societies were the\r\nvarious New York sections of the International Workingmen’s Association,\r\nbearing a banner with their motto, ‘Workingmen of all Countries, Unite!’\r\nThe following year witnessed the disasters in the industrial and\r\ncommercial world * * *; and the distress consequent thereupon was an\r\nimportant aid to their propaganda. The ‘Exceptional Law’ passed against\r\nSocialists, by the German Parliament in 1878, drove many Socialists from\r\nGermany to this country, and these have strengthened the cause of\r\nAmerican Socialism through membership in trades-unions and in the\r\nSocialistic Labor Party.”\r\n\r\n“There have been several changes among the Socialists in party\r\norganization and name since 1873, and national conventions or congresses\r\nhave met from time to time. Their dates and places of meeting have been\r\nPhiladelphia, 1874; Pittsburg, 1876; Newark, 1877; Allegheny City, 1880;\r\nBaltimore and Pittsburg, 1883, and Cincinnati, 1885. The name\r\nSocialistic Labor Party was adopted in 1877 at the Newark convention. In\r\n1883 the split between the moderates and extremists had become definite,\r\nand the latter held their congress in Pittsburg and the former in\r\nBaltimore.”\r\n\r\nIn 1876 the Workingmen’s Party was organized and in 1877, at the\r\nconvention held at Newark, it became the Socialistic Labor Party. The\r\ncourse of the party was marked by bitter internal dissension. While the\r\nmembership was largely made up of radicals they were elementally\r\ninharmonious and at cross purposes.\r\n\r\nThe common point of union was hostility to the prevailing regime; beyond\r\nthat the trouble began, for the anarchists and communists were still in\r\nthe same movement with the Socialists, having yet to be differentiated\r\nin the subsequent industrial and social development.\r\n\r\nThe Socialists were intent upon building up a working class party for\r\nindependent political action; the anarchists repudiated the ballot and\r\nadvocated the overthrow of capitalist rule by any means, including\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nAugust Spies, who was afterward executed for his alleged complicity in\r\nthe Haymarket riots, was at this time a prominent member of the party.\r\nHe used anarchism and socialism as synonymous terms. He said:\r\n\r\n“Anarchism, or Socialism, means the reorganization of society upon\r\nscientific principles and the abolition of causes which produce vice and\r\ncrime.”\r\n\r\nGeorge Engel, who shared the same cruel fate, said:\r\n\r\n“Anarchism and Socialism are as much alike, in my opinion, as one egg is\r\nto another. They differ only in their tactics. The anarchists have\r\nabandoned the way of liberating humanity which Socialists would take to\r\naccomplish this. I say: Believe no more in the ballot, and use all other\r\nmeans at your command.”\r\n\r\nThese differences in tactics alluded to by Engel not only created\r\nviolent dissensions in the party, but resulted in the withdrawal of the\r\nanarchists into groups of their own, followed later by the execution and\r\nimprisonment of their leaders because of their alleged participation in\r\nthe Haymarket riots.\r\n\r\nBut with all the difficulties that confronted it on every hand and the\r\nfierce factional contention within its own ranks, the Socialist Labor\r\nParty, composed of thoughtful, intelligent men, aggressive and\r\nprogressive, of rugged honesty and thrilled with the revolutionary\r\nspirit and the aspiration for freedom, became from its inception a\r\ndecided factor in the labor movement. It first appeared upon the scene\r\nwhen the country was seething with discontent, the result of the\r\nprolonged period of financial and industrial depression that began in\r\n1873 and like a scourge spread rapidly over the country, leaving\r\ndesolation and gloom in its wake. To the working class it was an ordeal\r\nof fire, but the suffering and sacrifice were not in vain. Economic\r\nnecessity determined the course of events and the workers, some of them\r\nat least, had their eyes opened to the cause of their misery and were\r\nthus impelled to action looking to the abolition of the existing\r\nindustrial disorder, based upon wage-slavery, rather than giving\r\nthemselves wholly, as they had hitherto done, to the fruitless task, as\r\nit now appeared, of ameliorating its effects and consequences. It was\r\nthese men, led by the foreign radicals, who had long before been\r\nscourged by the capitalist masters in their own lands, who rallied to\r\nthe revolutionary standard of the new working class party.\r\n\r\nThat such a party was born to a tempestuous career was, of course, a\r\nforegone conclusion. Its early trials and struggles tested the dauntless\r\nspirit of the comrades who engaged in them and constitute a thrilling\r\nchapter—which one day will be adequately understood and appreciated—in\r\nthe labor movement of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe busy, ignorant world about this revolutionary nucleus knew little or\r\nnothing about it; had no conception of its significance and looked upon\r\nits adherents as foolish fanatics whose antics were harmless and whose\r\ndesigns would dissolve like bubbles on the surface of a stream.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE LIBRARY, DEBS’ HOME\r\n\r\n  (See Page 59)\r\n]\r\n\r\nLooking backward it is not difficult to see what importance attaches to\r\nthis beginning of the political organization of the working class, as a\r\nclass, for the distinct purpose of conquering the public powers and\r\nemancipating the toilers from the inhumanity of wage-slavery.\r\n\r\nDiscussing this period and the work covered by it, Morris Hillquit, in\r\nhis “History of Socialism in the United States,” says:\r\n\r\n“The Socialist Labor Party was the dominant factor in the Socialist\r\nmovement of this country for more than twenty years, and its variegated\r\ncareer forms the most intricate and interesting part of the history of\r\nAmerican Socialism.”\r\n\r\n“At the first glance it appears a series of incoherent events,\r\nill-considered political experiments, sudden changes of policy,\r\nincongruous alliances, internal and external strife, and a succession of\r\nunaccountable ups and downs, with no perceptible progress or gain.”\r\n\r\n“But the confusion is only apparent. On closer analysis we find a\r\nlogical thread running all through the seemingly devious course of the\r\nparty, and a good reason for every one of its seemingly planless moves.”\r\n\r\n“The difficulties which beset the path of the Socialist Labor Party were\r\nextraordinary. As one of the first Socialist parties organized in this\r\ncountry on a national scale, it had to cope with the usual adversities\r\nwhich attend every radical movement at the outset of its career—weakness\r\nand diffidence in its own ranks, hostility and ridicule from the\r\noutside.”\r\n\r\nThese were stirring times. The trade-union movement was entering upon a\r\nperiod of unprecedented activity. The Knights of Labor were in the\r\nascendant and other labor unions were multiplying and rapidly increasing\r\ntheir membership. Everywhere the voice of the agitator was heard. In\r\nMarch, 1885, was inaugurated the strike of the Knights of Labor on the\r\nGould Southwest Railway system, to be followed by the greater strike on\r\nthe same system in 1886, which spread rapidly over the states of\r\nMissouri, Illinois, Arkansas, Kansas and Texas, and threatened to\r\ninvolve the railway traffic of all the western and southwestern states.\r\nIt was one of the most notable labor strikes and brought the Knights of\r\nLabor conspicuously before the whole country. The Knights were finally\r\nbeaten, although the fight was so stubbornly contested and the public\r\nwas so thoroughly aroused that Congress was prevailed upon to\r\ninvestigate the trouble and the committee issued a detailed report in\r\ntwo parts, containing about eleven hundred pages.\r\n\r\nOn May 1 of the same year the general strikes for the eight hour work\r\nday broke out in various parts of the country, involving several hundred\r\nthousand organized workers, most of whom met with disappointment and\r\nfailure.\r\n\r\nThe agitation carried on during this time for the shorter work day,\r\nknown as the eight hour movement, culminated on May 4, 1886, in the\r\nHaymarket riots at Chicago, and the outrageous execution of the\r\nanarchists on November 11 of the following year, a foul blot on our\r\ncapitalistic civilization that will remain to damn it forever.\r\n\r\nThe murderous assaults upon peaceable meetings and the brutal clubbing\r\nof orderly workingmen by the police of Chicago at the behest of their\r\npolitical superiors, the tools of the capitalist class, goaded the\r\nleaders almost to desperation and led to the Haymarket massacre, a\r\nfiendish plot to silence the agitation and crush the movement for an\r\neight hour work day which was spreading over the country; and, it must\r\nbe confessed, it served for a time at least the malign purpose of the\r\npretended supporters of “law and order.” But as certain as retributive\r\njustice pursues her course, the dragon’s teeth sown by the capitalist\r\nhand in the Haymarket tragedy, taking root in the blood of innocent\r\nworkingmen, will yet spring from the pregnant soil of freedom to avenge\r\nthe crimes of plutocratic tyranny and misrule.\r\n\r\nIn 1884 Laurence Gronlund published his “Co-Operative Commonwealth,” and\r\nhe was doubtless right when he claimed, six years later, that this work\r\nhad contributed its full share to the spread of Socialism. Gronlund said\r\nthat as late as 1880 he could count all the native American Socialists\r\non the fingers of one hand. When the patient labors, the bitter poverty\r\nand shocking privations of this pioneer Socialist are taken into\r\naccount, his untimely and almost tragic death seems to have been, after\r\nall, a blessed balm to his weary soul. He gave his life to civilize the\r\nworld and was rewarded with suffering and death.\r\n\r\nFour years after Gronlund’s “Co-Operative Commonwealth” appeared, in\r\n1888, Edward Bellamy published his “Looking Backward,” and it had a most\r\nwonderful effect upon the people. He struck a responsive popular chord\r\nand his name was upon every tongue. The editions ran into the hundreds\r\nof thousands and the people were profoundly stirred by what was called\r\nthe vision of a poetic dreamer. Although not an exposition of scientific\r\nsocialism, Bellamy’s social romance, “Looking Backward,” with its\r\nsequel, “Equality,” were valuable and timely contributions to the\r\nliterature of Socialism and not only aroused the people but started many\r\non the road to the revolutionary movement. The quick and wide response\r\nto the author’s plea for a social readjustment evinced not only the\r\ndiscontent of the people, but their eager readiness to grasp at anything\r\nthat might give promise of escape from the poverty, the insecurity, the\r\ndaily horrors of the existing order. Thousands were moved to study the\r\nquestion by the books of Bellamy and thus became Socialists and found\r\ntheir way into the Socialist movement.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1888, the strike occurred on the Burlington system,\r\ninvolving all its engineers and firemen and some of its brakemen and\r\nswitchmen. P. M. Arthur, then grand chief of the Brotherhood of\r\nLocomotive Engineers, was threatened with federal court proceedings on\r\naccount of a boycott which had been placed upon the C., B. & Q. cars and\r\nwas so effective that it looked as if a complete tie-up of traffic would\r\nresult from it. The boycott was raised and the strike began to wane. But\r\nthe contest continued almost a year and it cost the brotherhoods fully\r\ntwo million dollars. At last, however, the strikers were exhausted and\r\ncompelled to yield to total defeat.\r\n\r\nThus was it proved by the loss of another great railroad strike—not one\r\nof which was ever won by the brotherhoods—that when the supreme test of\r\nstrength comes the railway unions are always crushed by the railway\r\ncorporations.\r\n\r\nThe defeat of this and other strikes, together with the fact that most\r\nrailway employes were ineligible to the then existing brotherhoods, led\r\nto the organization of the American Railway Union in 1893, which\r\nembraced all the employes in the railway service. The new union grew\r\nrapidly. Soon after it was organized it engaged in and won several minor\r\nstrikes. In April, 1894, the strike on the Great Northern, involving all\r\nthe employes of the entire system, was fought, and resulted in a\r\ncomplete victory for the union in less than three weeks. A short time\r\nlater another strike was threatened owing to disagreement growing out of\r\nthe construction of the agreement. For the second time the A. R. U. came\r\nout victorious. At this time thousands were pouring into the union all\r\nover the country. Then followed the Pullman strike, in the latter part\r\nof June.\r\n\r\nThe Pullman company, backed by the combined railway corporations,\r\nrepresented by the General Managers’ Association, resolved to crush the\r\nunion. They not only failed, but the union paralyzed their traffic and\r\ndefeated them all. Seeing that the union was triumphant they changed\r\ntheir tactics. They had the United States marshal of Illinois swear in\r\nan army of deputies, ostensibly to protect property, but in fact to\r\nincite tumult. In his official report to the council of Chicago the\r\nChief of Police said that these “deputies” consisted of thieves, thugs\r\nand ex-convicts, the worst element that had ever been turned loose on\r\nany city. As soon as the deputies began to operate, as directed by their\r\nleaders, and under cover of night, trouble began, and this is what the\r\ncorporations wanted. Peace and order were fatal to them as turbulence\r\nand violence were fatal to the union. They understood this perfectly.\r\nHence the deputies and disorder. Immediately these thugs began to\r\nperform, the capitalist papers and Associated Press flashed broadcast\r\nthe falsehood that the strikers were on the warpath and threatened\r\ndestruction to every living thing. The falsehood caught on like magic.\r\nFar and wide the cry went up: “Down with the A. R. U.! Down with\r\nanarchy!” The tide turned. The triumphant union and defeated\r\ncorporations changed places. With practically the whole population\r\naroused against the A. R. U. every outrage upon it was not only\r\npossible, but perpetrated with mad zeal in the name of patriotism. The\r\nA. R. U. had no press, no way of getting its side before the people, and\r\nthousands of the very workers in whose behalf it was fighting and had\r\nstaked everything, turned upon it and joined in the flood of angry\r\ndenunciation that was launched upon it.\r\n\r\nInjunctions by the hundred were issued and served by all the courts\r\nbetween the Ohio and the Pacific. A half dozen burly ruffians, by order\r\nof the federal authorities—precisely whom could never be learned—backed\r\nup a cart at the union headquarters, forced their way into the offices,\r\nsacked them, taking records, books, private papers and unopened letters,\r\nwithout warrant of any description, nailing up the headquarters and\r\nhauling the booty to the federal building.\r\n\r\nHow is this for a specimen of “law and order” the capitalist class and\r\ntheir brood of hirelings so ceaselessly harp about?\r\n\r\nIn violation of law and precedent and in defiance of the protest of the\r\ngovernor of Illinois, the mayor of Chicago and an overwhelming majority\r\nof the people, Grover Cleveland, then President of the United States,\r\nforced the federal troops into the state for the sole purpose of aiding\r\nthe corporations to crush the union and defeat the strike, and when\r\nhistory shall be truthfully written, this crime will make the name of\r\nCleveland the synonym of infamy forever.\r\n\r\nThousands of falsehoods were coined and circulated by the capitalist\r\npress, shifting the blame of lawlessness and crime from the instigators\r\nto innocent men; the leaders were arrested without charges and jailed\r\nwithout trial, headquarters were broken up, a special grand jury was\r\nsworn in expressly to indict, a notorious capitalist union-hater being\r\nmade foreman, and a hundred other flagrant violations of the law and\r\noutrages upon justice were committed in the name of law to defeat\r\njustice and enthrone corporate rapacity.\r\n\r\nThe venality of capitalist government never made so bold an exhibition\r\nof itself. It was scandalous beyond expression and shocking to the last\r\ndegree. Every department of the federal government was freely placed at\r\nthe service of the railroad corporations and Republican and Democratic\r\nofficials vied with each other in cheerful and servile obedience to\r\ntheir masters.\r\n\r\nWhen the government and its capitalist lackeys had completed their\r\nservice as corporation scavengers, General Miles, the military satrap,\r\nlike a vulture stuffed with carrion, pompously exclaimed at a\r\nplutocratic banquet in honor of his gallant services:\r\n\r\n“_I have broken the backbone of this strike._”\r\n\r\nSuch sublime heroism in such a holy cause, Grover Cleveland, Nelson\r\nMiles, et al., will not be forgotten nor remain unrewarded.\r\n\r\nThe _Coming Nation_, started at Greensburg, Ind., by J. A. Wayland, in\r\n1893, was the first popular propaganda paper to be published in the\r\ninterest of Socialism in this country. It reached a large circulation\r\nand the proceeds were used in founding and developing the Ruskin\r\nCo-operative colony in Tennessee. Later Mr. Wayland began the\r\npublication of the _Appeal to Reason_, and now it numbers its\r\nsubscribers by the hundreds of thousands. It is not saying too much for\r\nthe _Appeal_ that it has been a great factor in preparing the American\r\nsoil for the seed of Socialism. Its enormous editions have been and are\r\nbeing spread broadcast and copies may be found in the remotest recesses\r\nand the most inaccessible regions. The propaganda thus organized by Mr.\r\nWayland, for which he has peculiar genius, and carried forward and\r\nenlarged constantly with the aid of a corps of able comrades, has been\r\nand is a source of incalculable strength in promoting education among\r\nthe workers and building up the general movement.\r\n\r\nThe periodical end weekly press, so necessary to any political movement,\r\nis now developing rapidly and there is every reason to believe that\r\nwithin the next few years there will be a formidable array of reviews,\r\nmagazines, illustrated journals and daily and weekly papers to represent\r\nthe movement and do battle for its supremacy.\r\n\r\nThe last convention of the American Railway Union was the first\r\nconvention of the Social Democracy of America, and this was held at\r\nChicago in June, 1897, the delegates voting to change the railway union\r\ninto a working class political party.\r\n\r\nThe _Railway Times_, the official paper of the union, became the _Social\r\nDemocrat_ and later the _Social Democratic Herald_, and is now published\r\nat Milwaukee in the interest of the Socialist party.\r\n\r\nThe Social Democracy, the evolution of unionism crushed by the weight of\r\ndespotic power, was the logical extension and expansion of the American\r\nRailway Union, and the direct outgrowth of the great industrial uprising\r\nknown as the Pullman strike and the brutal tyranny and relentless\r\npersecution that followed it.\r\n\r\nThe General Managers’ Association pursued the American Railway Union\r\nwith fiendish ferocity, determined to stamp out the last spark of its\r\nlife, and as a result, when the few surviving delegates met in national\r\nconvention in the year named, the last they ever held as a railway labor\r\nunion, the American Railway Union, loved and respected by labor, and\r\nfeared and hated by capital, was metamorphosed into the Social\r\nDemocracy.\r\n\r\nAt the national convention which followed a year later, in June, 1898, a\r\nsplit occurred, one wing adhering to the colonization scheme, making\r\nthat the chief end of their movement, while the latter abandoned the\r\ncolonization feature and struck out for political action as a working\r\nclass party. The latter was known as the Social Democratic Party and\r\nprogressed rapidly from the start, while the former soon exhausted its\r\nresources and passed out of existence.\r\n\r\nThe Socialist Labor Party, in which internal dissension had been brewing\r\nfor some time, divided into separate factions in July, 1899, the\r\nanti-administration faction uniting with the Social Democratic Party in\r\nthe following year, giving the united party the name of the Socialist\r\nParty, the name it bears today.\r\n\r\nIn the brief summary of the development of the American movement much\r\nhas had to be omitted for the want of space. To sketch in outline\r\nmerely, with the hope of stimulating to further reading and study of the\r\nhistory and literature of the Socialist movement has been the purpose of\r\nthis brief treatise.\r\n\r\nScarcely, however, can reference be omitted to the helpful influence of\r\nthe popular pen of Robert Blatchford, the author of “Merrie England” and\r\nother works, and one of the most simple, attractive and convincing\r\nwriters on Socialism in all the world. Hundreds of thousands of copies\r\nof “Merrie England” have been sold and given away and the demand still\r\ncontinues. The work of Mr. Blatchford is specially adapted to beginners.\r\nHe has the rare faculty of making himself interesting to the workingman\r\nand working woman, addressing himself to them in their own simple\r\nlanguage and illustrating his argument in the same simple and convincing\r\nfashion. Robert Blatchford and his writings have contributed materially\r\nto the spread of Socialism in this country and are justly entitled to\r\nthe grateful acknowledgment of the American movement.\r\n\r\nReference to Karl Marx, Ferdinand Lassalle, Frederick Engels, William\r\nLiebknecht and August Bebel, the titans of revolutionary socialism, and\r\ntheir contemporaries and successors, need not be made in these brief\r\npages, nor to the Socialist classics which are so well known and may be\r\nread in all languages.\r\n\r\nThe immortal shibboleth of Marx: “Workingmen of all countries, unite!\r\nYou have nothing to lose but your chains—you have a world to gain,” is\r\nthe rallying cry of the class struggle, the inspiration of the working\r\nclass, and is heard echoing and re-echoing around the world.\r\n\r\nThe Socialist vote in the United States shows a steady and, all things\r\nconsidered, satisfactory progress of the movement.\r\n\r\nIn the national election of 1892 the Socialist vote was 21,164.\r\n\r\nIn 1896 the vote was 36,274.\r\n\r\nIn 1900 the Socialist Party cast 87,814 votes and the Socialist Labor\r\nParty 39,739 votes, a total of 127,553 votes.\r\n\r\nSince the election of 1900 there has been greater activity in organizing\r\nand a more widespread propaganda than ever before. In the elections of\r\nthe past it can scarcely be claimed that the Socialist movement was\r\nrepresented by a national party. It entered these contests with but few\r\nstates organized and with no resources worth mentioning to sustain it\r\nduring the campaign.\r\n\r\nIt is far different today.\r\n\r\nThe Socialist party is organized in almost every state and territory in\r\nthe American Union. Its members are filled with enthusiasm and working\r\nwith an energy born of the throb and thrill of revolution. The party has\r\na press supporting it that extends from sea to sea, and is as vigilant\r\nand tireless in its labors as it is steadfast and true to the party\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\nThe Socialist party stands upon a sound platform, embodying the\r\nprinciples of International Socialism, clearly and eloquently expressed,\r\nand proclaims its mission of conquest on the basis of the class\r\nstruggle. Its tactics are in harmony with its principles, and both are\r\nabsolutely uncompromising.\r\n\r\nViewed today from any intelligent standpoint the outlook of the\r\nSocialist movement is full of promise to the workers of coming freedom.\r\n\r\nIt is the break of dawn upon the horizon of human destiny and it has no\r\nlimitations but the walls of the universe.\r\n\r\nWhat party strife or factional turmoil may yet ensue we neither know nor\r\ncare. We only know that the principles of Socialism are necessary to the\r\nemancipation of the working class and to the true happiness of all\r\nclasses and that its historic mission is that of a conquering movement.\r\nWe know that day by day, nourished by the misery and vitalized by the\r\naspirations of the working class, the area of its activity widens, it\r\ngrows in strength and increases its mental and moral grasp, and when the\r\nfinal hour of capitalism and wage slavery strikes, the Socialist\r\nmovement, the greatest in all history—great enough to embrace the human\r\nrace—will crown the class struggles of the centuries with victory and\r\nproclaim FREEDOM TO ALL MANKIND.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Unionism and Socialism\r\n\r\nThe labor question, as it is called, has come to be recognized as the\r\nforemost of our time. In some form it thrusts itself into every human\r\nrelation, and directly or indirectly has a part in every controversy.\r\n\r\nA thousand “solutions” of the labor question find their way into print,\r\nbut the question not only remains unsolved, but steadily assumes greater\r\nand graver proportions. The nostrums have no effect other than to prove\r\ntheir own inefficacy.\r\n\r\nThere has always been a labor question since man first exploited man in\r\nthe struggle for existence, but not until its true meaning was revealed\r\nin the development of modern industry did it command serious thought or\r\nintelligent consideration, and only then came any adequate conception of\r\nits importance to the race.\r\n\r\nMan has always sought the mastery of his fellow-man. To enslave his\r\nfellow in some form and to live out of his labor has been the mainspring\r\nof human action.\r\n\r\nTo escape submission, not in freedom, but in mastery over others, has\r\nbeen the controlling desire, and this has filled the world with slavery\r\nand crime.\r\n\r\nIn all the ages of the past, human society has been organized and\r\nmaintained upon the basis of the exploitation and degradation of those\r\nwho toil. And so it is today.\r\n\r\nThe chief end of government has been and is to keep the victims of\r\noppression and injustice in subjection.\r\n\r\nThe men and women who toil and produce have been and are at the mercy of\r\nthose who wax fat and scornful upon the fruit of their labor.\r\n\r\nThe labor question was born of the first pang of protest that died\r\nunvoiced in the breast of unrequited toil.\r\n\r\nThe labor movement of modern times is the product of past ages. It has\r\ncome down to us for the impetus of our day, in pursuit of its world-wide\r\nmission of emancipation.\r\n\r\nUnionism, as applied to labor in the modern sense, is the fruit and\r\nflower of the last century.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, as in other countries, the trade union dates from\r\nthe beginning of industrial society.\r\n\r\nDuring the colonial period of our history, when agriculture was the\r\nprincipal pursuit, when the shop was small and work was done by hand\r\nwith simple tools, and the worker could virtually employ himself, there\r\nwas no unionism among the workers.\r\n\r\nWhen machinery was applied to industry, and mill and factory took the\r\nplace of the country blacksmith shop; when the workers were divorced\r\nfrom their tools and recruited in the mills; when they were obliged to\r\ncompete against each other for employment; when they found themselves in\r\nthe labor market with but a low bid or none at all upon their labor\r\npower; when they began to realize that as toolless workingmen they were\r\nat the mercy of the tool-owning masters, the necessity for union among\r\nthem took root, and as industry developed, the trade union movement\r\nfollowed in its wake and became a factor in the struggle of the workers\r\nagainst the aggressions of their employers.\r\n\r\nIn his search for the beginnings of trade unionism in our country, Prof.\r\nRichard T. Ely, in his “Labor Movement in America,” says: “I find no\r\ntraces of anything like a modern trades union in the colonial period of\r\nAmerican history, and it is evident, on reflection, that there was\r\nlittle need, if any, of organization on the part of labor at that time.”\r\n* * *\r\n\r\n“Such manufacturing as was found consisted largely in the production of\r\nvalues-in-use. Clothing, for example, was spun and woven, and then\r\nconverted into garments in the household for its various members. The\r\nartisans comprised chiefly the carpenter, the blacksmith and the\r\nshoemaker; many of whom worked in their own little shops with no\r\nemployes, while the number of subordinates in any one shop was almost\r\ninvariably small, and it would probably have been difficult to find a\r\njourneyman who did not expect, in a few years, to become an independent\r\nproducer.”\r\n\r\nThis was the general condition from the labor standpoint at the close of\r\nthe eighteenth century. But with the dawn of the new century and the\r\napplication of machinery and the spread of industry that followed came\r\nthe beginning of the change. The workers gradually organized into unions\r\nand began to take active measures to increase their wages and otherwise\r\nimprove their condition. Referring to this early period in the rise of\r\nunionism, the same author records the incident of one of the first\r\nstrikes as follows: “Something very like a modern strike occurred in the\r\nyear 1802. The sailors in New York received $10 a month, but wished an\r\nincrease of $4 a month, and endeavored to enforce their demands by\r\nquitting work. It is said that they marched about the city, accompanied\r\nby a band, and compelled seamen, employed at the old wages, to leave\r\ntheir ships and join them. But the iniquitous combination and conspiracy\r\nlaws, which viewed concerted action of laborers as a crime, were then in\r\nforce in all modern lands, and ‘the constables were soon in pursuit,\r\narrested the leader, lodged him in jail, and so ended the earliest of\r\nlabor strikes.’”\r\n\r\nThis sounds as if it had been the occurrence of yesterday, instead of\r\nmore than a hundred years ago. The combination and conspiracy laws have\r\nbeen repealed, but the labor leader fares no better now than when these\r\nlaws were still on the statute books. The writ of injunction is now made\r\nto serve the purpose of the master class, and there is no possible\r\nsituation in which it cannot be made to apply and as swiftly and surely\r\nstrike the vital point and paralyze the opposition to the master’s rule.\r\n\r\nWe need not at this time trace the growth of the trade union from its\r\nsmall and local beginnings to its present national and international\r\nproportions; from the little group of hand-workers in the service of an\r\nindividual employer to the armies of organized and federated workers in\r\nallied industries controlled by vast corporations, syndicates and\r\ntrusts. The fact stands forth in bold relief that the union was born of\r\nnecessity and that it has grown strong with the development of industry\r\nand the increasing economic dependence of the workers.\r\n\r\nA century ago a boy served his apprenticeship and became the master of\r\nhis trade. The few simple tools with which work was then done were\r\ngenerally owned by the man who used them; he could provide himself with\r\nthe small quantity of raw material he required, and freely follow his\r\nchosen pursuit and enjoy the fruit of his labor. But as everything had\r\nto be produced by the work of his hands, production was a slow process,\r\nmeagre of results, and the worker found it necessary to devote from\r\ntwelve to fifteen hours to his daily task to earn a sufficient amount to\r\nsupport himself and family.\r\n\r\nIt required most of the time and energy of the average worker to produce\r\nenough to satisfy the physical wants of himself and those dependent upon\r\nhis labor.\r\n\r\nThere was little leisure for mental improvement, for recreation or\r\nsocial intercourse. The best that can be said for the workingman of this\r\nperiod is that he enjoyed political freedom, controlled in large measure\r\nhis own employment, by virtue of his owning the tools of his trade,\r\nappropriated to his own use the product of his labor and lived his\r\nquiet, uneventful round to the end of his days.\r\n\r\nThis was a new country, with boundless stretches of virgin soil. There\r\nwas ample room and opportunity, air and sunlight, for all.\r\n\r\nThere was no millionaire in the United States; nor was there a tramp.\r\nThese types are the products of the same system. The former is produced\r\nat the expense of the latter, and both at the expense of the working\r\nclass. They appeared at the same time in the industrial development and\r\nthey will disappear together with the abolition of the system that\r\nbrought them into existence.\r\n\r\nThe application of machinery to productive industry was followed by\r\ntremendous and far-reaching changes in the whole structure of society.\r\nFirst among these was the change in the status of the worker, who, from\r\nan independent mechanic or small producer, was reduced to the level of a\r\ndependent wageworker. The machine had leaped, as it were, into the arena\r\nof industrial activity, and had left little or no room for the\r\napplication of the worker’s skill or the use of his individual tools.\r\n\r\nThe economic dependence of the working class became more and more\r\nrigidly fixed—and at the same time a new era dawned for the human race.\r\n\r\nThe more or less isolated individual artisans were converted into groups\r\nof associated workers and marshalled for the impending social\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that the trades-union movement began to take\r\ndefinite form. Unorganized, the workers were not only in open\r\ncompetition with each other for the sale of their labor power in the\r\nlabor market, but their wages could be reduced, and their hours of labor\r\nlengthened at will, and they were left practically at the mercy of their\r\nemployers.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note the spirit evinced by the pioneers of\r\nunionism, the causes that impelled them and the reasons they assigned\r\nfor banding themselves together in defense of their common interests. In\r\nthis connection we again quote from Professor Ely’s “Labor Movement in\r\nAmerica,” as follows:\r\n\r\n“The next event to attract our attention in New York is an address\r\ndelivered before ‘The General Trades Unions of the City of New York,’ at\r\nChatham street chapel, on December 2, 1833, by Eli Moore, president of\r\nthe union. This General Trades Union, as its name indicates, was a\r\ncombination of subordinate unions ‘of the various trades and arts in New\r\nYork City and its vicinity,’ and is the earliest example in the United\r\nStates, so far as I know, of those Central Labor Unions which attempt to\r\nunite all the workingmen in one locality in one body, and which have now\r\nbecome so common among us. The address of Mr. Moore is characterized by\r\na more modern tone than is found in most productions of the labor\r\nleaders of that period. The object of these unions is stated to be ‘to\r\nguard against the encroachments of aristocracy, to preserve our natural\r\nand political rights, to elevate our moral and intellectual condition,\r\nto promote our pecuniary interests, to narrow the line of distinction\r\nbetween the journeyman and employer, to establish the honor and safety\r\nof our respective vocations upon a more secure and permanent basis, and\r\nto alleviate the distress of those suffering from want of employment.’”\r\n\r\nThis is a remarkably clear statement of the objects of unionism in that\r\nearly period, and indicates to what extent workingmen had even then been\r\ncompelled to recognize their craft interests and unite and act together\r\nin defense thereof.\r\n\r\nSo far, and for many years later, the efforts of trades-unions were\r\nconfined to defensive tactics, and to the amelioration of objectionable\r\nconditions. The wage-system had yet to develop its most offensive\r\nfeatures and awaken the workers to the necessity of putting an end to it\r\nas the only means of achieving their freedom; and it was this that\r\nfinally forced the extension of organized activity from the economic to\r\nthe political field of labor unionism.\r\n\r\nAs the use of machinery became more general and competition became more\r\nintense; as capital was centralized and industry organized to obtain\r\nbetter results, the workers realized their dependence more and more, and\r\nunionism grew apace. One trade after another fell into line and raised\r\nthe banner of economic solidarity. Then followed strikes and lockouts\r\nand other devices incident to that form of warfare. Sometimes the\r\nunionists gained an advantage, but more often they suffered defeat, lost\r\ncourage and abandoned the union, only to return to the scene of disaster\r\nwith renewed determination to fight the battle over again and again\r\nuntil victory should at last perch upon the union banner.\r\n\r\nOh, how many there were, whose names are forgotten, who suffered untold\r\nagonies to lay the foundation of the labor movement, of whose real\r\nmission they had but the vaguest conception!\r\n\r\nThese pioneers of progress paved the way for us, and deserve far more at\r\nour hands than we have in our power to do for them. We may at best\r\nrescue their nameless memory from the darkness of oblivion, and this we\r\nundertake to do with the liveliest sense of obligation for the service\r\nthey rendered, and the sacrifices they made in the early and trying\r\nstages of the struggle to improve the condition and advance the welfare\r\nof their fellow-toilers.\r\n\r\nThe writer has met and known some of these untitled agitators of the\r\nearlier day, whose hearts were set on organizing their class, or at\r\nleast, their branch of it, and who had the courage to undertake the task\r\nand accept all the bitter consequences it imposed.\r\n\r\nThe union men of today have little or no conception of what the pioneer\r\nunionists had to contend with when they first started forth on their\r\nmission of organization. The organizer of the present time has to face\r\ndifficulties enough, it is true, but as a rule the road has at least\r\nbeen broken for his approaching footsteps; the union has already been\r\norganized and a committee meets him at the station and escorts him to\r\nthe hotel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MR. DEBS AND HIS LITTLE GIRARD COMRADES\r\n\r\n  (See Page 243)\r\n]\r\n\r\nFar different was it with the pioneer who left home without “scrip in\r\nhis purse,” whose chief stock consisted in his ability to “screw his\r\ncourage to the sticking point” and whom privation and hardship only\r\nconsecrated more completely to his self-appointed martyrdom.\r\n\r\nStarting out, more than likely, after having been discharged for\r\norganizing a local union of his craft, or for serving on a committee, or\r\ninterceding for a fellow, or “talking back” to the boss, or any other of\r\nthe numerous acts which mark the conduct of the manly worker,\r\ndistinguishing him from his weak and fawning brother, and bringing upon\r\nhim the reprobation of his master—starting out to organize his\r\nfellow-workers, that they might fare better than fell to his lot, he\r\nfaced the world without a friend to bid him welcome, or cheer him\r\nonward. Having no money for railroad fare he must beat his way, but such\r\na slight inconvenience does not deter him an instant. Reaching his\r\ndestination he brushes up as well as his scanty toilet will allow and\r\nthen proceeds with due caution to look up “the boys,” careful to elude\r\nthe vigilance of the boss, who has no earthly use for a worthless labor\r\nagitator.\r\n\r\nWe shall not attempt to follow our pioneer through all his tortuous\r\nwindings, nor have we space to more than hint at the story of his cruel\r\npersecution and pathetic end.\r\n\r\nOur pioneer, leaving home, in many an instance, never saw wife and child\r\nagain. Repulsed by the very men he was hungering to serve, penniless,\r\ndeserted, neglected and alone, he became “the poor wanderer of a stormy\r\nday,” and ended his career a nameless outcast. Whatever his frailties\r\nand faults, they were virtues all, for they marked the generous heart,\r\nthe sympathetic soul who loves his brother and accepts for himself the\r\nbitter portion of suffering and shame that he may serve his fellowman.\r\n\r\nThe labor agitator of the early day held no office, had no title, drew\r\nno salary, saw no footlights, heard no applause, never saw his name in\r\nprint, and fills an unknown grave.\r\n\r\nThe labor movement is his monument, and though his name is not inscribed\r\nupon it, his soul is in it, and with it marches on forever.\r\n\r\nFrom the small beginnings of a century ago the trades-union movement,\r\nkeeping pace with the industrial development, has become a tremendous\r\npower in the land.\r\n\r\nThe close of the Civil War was followed by a new era of industrial and\r\ncommercial activity, and trades-unions sprang up on every hand. Local\r\norganizations of the same craft multiplied and were united in national\r\nbodies, and these were in time bound together in national and\r\ninternational federation.\r\n\r\nThe swift and vast concentration of capital and the unprecedented\r\nindustrial activity which marked the close of the nineteenth century\r\nwere followed by the most extraordinary growth in the number and variety\r\nof trades-unions in the history of the movement; yet this expansion,\r\nremarkable as it was, has not only been equalled, but excelled, in the\r\nfirst years of the new century, the tide of unionism sweeping over the\r\nwhole country, and rising steadily higher, notwithstanding the efforts\r\nput forth from a hundred sources controlled by the ruling class to\r\nrestrain its march, impair its utility or stamp it out of existence.\r\n\r\nThe history of the last thirty years of trades-unionism is filled with\r\nstirring incident and supplies abundant material for a good-sized\r\nvolume. Organizations have risen and fallen, battles have been fought\r\nwith varying results, every device known to the ingenuity of the ruling\r\nclass has been employed to check the movement, but through it all the\r\ntrend has been steadily toward a more perfect organization and a more\r\ncomprehensive grasp of its mighty mission. The strikes and boycotts and\r\nlockouts which occurred with startling frequency during this period,\r\nsome of them accompanied by riots and other forms of violence, tell\r\ntheir own tragic story of the class struggle which is shaking the\r\nfoundations of society, and will end only with the complete overthrow of\r\nthe wage-system and the freedom of the working class from every form of\r\nslavery.\r\n\r\nNo strike has even been lost, and there can be no defeat for the labor\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\nHowever disastrous the day of battle has been, it has been worth its\r\nprice, and only the scars remain to bear testimony that the movement is\r\ninvincible and that no mortal wound can be inflicted upon it.\r\n\r\nWhat has the union done for the worker? Far more than these brief pages\r\nwill allow us to place on record.\r\n\r\nThe union has from its inception taught, however imperfectly, the\r\nfundamental need of solidarity; it has inspired hope in the breast of\r\nthe defeated and despairing worker, joining his hand with the hand of\r\nhis fellow-worker and bidding them lift their bowed bodies from the\r\nearth and look above and beyond the tribulations of the hour to the\r\nshining heights of future achievement.\r\n\r\nThe union has fought the battles of the worker upon a thousand fields,\r\nand though defeated often, rallied and charged again and again to wrest\r\nfrom the enemy the laurels of victory.\r\n\r\nThe union was first to trace in outline the lesson above all others the\r\nworkingman needs to learn, and that is the collective interest and\r\nwelfare of his class, in which his own is indissolubly bound, and that\r\nno vital or permanent change of conditions is possible that does not\r\nembrace his class as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe union has been a moral stimulus as well as a material aid to the\r\nworker; it has appealed to him to develop his faculties and to think for\r\nhimself; to cultivate self-reliance and learn to depend upon himself; to\r\nhave pride of character and make some effort to improve himself; to\r\nsympathize with and support his fellow-workers and make their cause his\r\nown.\r\n\r\nAlthough these things have as yet been only vaguely and imperfectly\r\naccomplished, yet they started in and have grown with the union, and to\r\nthis extent the union has promoted the class-conscious solidarity of the\r\nworking-class.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the trades-union movement has in some essential respects\r\nproved a disappointment, but it may not on this account be repudiated as\r\na failure. The worst that can in truth be said of it is that it has not\r\nkept up with the procession of events, that it lacks the progressive\r\nspirit so necessary to its higher development and larger usefulness, but\r\nthere are reasons for this and they suggest themselves to the most\r\ncasual student of the movement.\r\n\r\nWhen workingmen first began to organize unions every effort was made by\r\nthe employing class to stamp out the incipient “rebellion.” This was\r\nkept up for years, but in spite of all that could be done to extinguish\r\nthe fires of revolt, the smouldering embers broke forth again and again,\r\neach time with increased intensity and vigor; and when at last it became\r\napparent to the shrewder and more far-seeing members of the capitalist\r\nfamily that the union movement had come to stay, they forthwith changed\r\ntheir tactics, discarding their frowns and masking their features with\r\nthe most artful smiles as they extended their greeting and pronounced\r\ntheir blessing upon this latest and greatest benefaction to the human\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nIn fewer words, seeing that they could not head it off, they decided to\r\ntake it by the hand and guide it into harmless channels.\r\n\r\nThis is precisely the policy pursued, first and last, by the late Marcus\r\nA. Hanna, and it will not be denied that he had the entire confidence of\r\nthe capitalist class and that they clearly recognized his keen\r\nperception, astute diplomacy and sagacious leadership in dealing with\r\nthe union movement.\r\n\r\nMr. Hanna denominated the national leaders of the trades-unions as his\r\n“lieutenants;” had the “Civic Federation” organized and himself elected\r\npresident, that he and his lieutenants might meet upon equal ground and\r\nas often as necessary; he slapped them familiarly on the back, had his\r\npicture taken with them and cracked jokes with them; and all the time he\r\nwas doing this he was the beau ideal of Wall street, the ruling voice in\r\nthe capitalist councils, and all the trusts, syndicates and combines,\r\nall the magnates, barons, lords and plutocrats in one voice proclaimed\r\nhim the ruler of rulers, the political prophet of their class, the\r\ncorner stone and central pillar in the capitalist temple.\r\n\r\nMr. Hanna did not live to see his plan of “benevolent feudalism”\r\nconsummated, nor to be elected President of the United States, as his\r\nWall street admirers and trades-union friends intended, but he did live\r\nlong enough to see the gathering clouds of the social revolution on the\r\npolitical horizon; and to prevent the trades-union movement from\r\nbecoming a factor in it, he taxed the resources of his fertile brain and\r\nbended all the energies of his indomitable will. Clearer sighted than\r\nall others of his class, he was promptly crowned their leader. He saw\r\nwhat was coming and prepared to meet and defeat it, or at least put off\r\nthe crisis to a later day.\r\n\r\nThe trades-union movement must remain a “pure and simple” organization.\r\nIt must not be subject to the laws of evolution; it must be securely\r\nanchored to its conservative, time-honored policy, hold fast to its good\r\nname and preserve inviolate all the traditions of the past. Finally, it\r\nmust eschew politics as utterly destructive of trades-union ends, and\r\nabove all, beware of and guard against the contamination of socialism,\r\nwhose breath is disruption and whose touch is death.\r\n\r\nThat was the position of Senator Hanna; it is that of the smaller lights\r\nwho are serving as his successors. It is this position that is taken by\r\nthe press, the pulpit and the politician; it is this position that is\r\nreflected in the trades-union movement itself, and voiced by its\r\nofficials, who are at once the leaders of labor and the lieutenants of\r\ncapital, and who, in their dual role, find it more and more difficult to\r\nharmonize the conflicting interests of the class of whom they are the\r\nleaders and the class of whom they are the lieutenants.\r\n\r\nIt is not claimed for a moment that these leaders are corrupt in the\r\nsense that they would betray their trust for a consideration. Such\r\ncharges and intimations are frequently made, but so far as we know they\r\nare baseless and unjust in almost every instance; and it is our opinion\r\nthat an accusation of such gravity is never justified, whatever the\r\ncircumstances, unless the proof can be furnished to support the charge\r\nand convict the offender.\r\n\r\nBut the criticism to which these leaders are properly subject is that\r\nthey fear to offend the capitalist class, well knowing that the\r\ninfluence of this class is potential in the labor union, and that if the\r\nlabor lieutenant fails of obedience and respect to his superior\r\ncapitalist officers, he can soon be made to feel their displeasure, and\r\nunless he relents, his popularity wanes and he finds himself a leader\r\nwithout an office.\r\n\r\nThe late Peter M. Arthur, of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers,\r\nwas a conspicuous example of this kind of leadership. There was\r\nfrequently the most violent opposition to him, but his standing with the\r\nrailway corporations secured him in his position, and it was simply\r\nimpossible to dislodge him. Had he been radical instead of conservative,\r\nhad he stood wholly on the side of the engineers instead of cultivating\r\nthe good offices of the managers and placating the corporations, he\r\nwould have been deposed years ago and pronounced a miserable failure as\r\na labor leader.\r\n\r\nThe capitalist press has much to do with shaping the course of a labor\r\nleader; he shrinks from its cruel attacks and he yields, sometimes\r\nunconsciously, to its blandishments and honeyed phrases, and in spite of\r\nhimself becomes a servile trimmer and cowardly time-server.\r\n\r\nThe trades-union movement of the present day has enemies within and\r\nwithout, and upon all sides, some attacking it openly and others\r\ninsidiously, but all bent either upon destroying it or reducing it to\r\nunresisting impotency.\r\n\r\nThe enemies of unionism, while differing in method, are united solidly\r\nupon one point, and that is in the effort to misrepresent and discredit\r\nthe men who, scorning and defying the capitalist exploiters and their\r\nminions, point steadily the straight and uncompromising course the\r\nmovement must take if it is to accomplish its allotted task and safely\r\nreach its destined port.\r\n\r\nThese men, though frequently regarded as the enemies, are the true\r\nfriends of trades-unionism and in good time are certain to be\r\nvindicated.\r\n\r\nThe more or less open enemies have inaugurated some interesting\r\ninnovations during the past few years. The private armies the\r\ncorporations used some years ago, such as Pinkerton mercenaries, coal\r\nand iron police, deputy marshals, etc., have been relegated to second\r\nplace as out of date, or they are wholly out of commission. It has been\r\nfound after repeated experiments that the courts are far more deadly to\r\ntrades-unions, and that they operate noiselessly and with unerring\r\nprecision.\r\n\r\nThe rapid fire injunction is a great improvement on the gatling gun.\r\nNothing can get beyond its range and it never misses fire.\r\n\r\nThe capitalists are in entire control of the injunction artillery, and\r\nall the judicial gunner has to do is to touch it off at their command.\r\n\r\nStep by step the writ of injunction has invaded the domain of\r\ntrades-unionism, limiting its jurisdiction, curtailing its powers,\r\nsapping its strength and undermining its foundations, and this has been\r\ndone by the courts in the name of the institutions they were designed to\r\nsafeguard, but have shamelessly betrayed at the behest of the barons of\r\ncapitalism.\r\n\r\nInjunctions have been issued restraining the trades-unions and their\r\nmembers from striking, from boycotting, from voting funds to strikes,\r\nfrom levying assessments to support their members, from walking on the\r\npublic highway, from asking non-union men not to take their places, from\r\nmeeting to oppose wage reductions, from expelling a spy from membership,\r\nfrom holding conversation with those who had taken or were about to take\r\ntheir jobs, from congregating in public places, from holding meetings,\r\nfrom doing anything and everything, directly, indirectly or any other\r\nway, to interfere with the employing class in their unalienable right to\r\noperate their plants as their own interests may dictate, and to run\r\nthings generally to suit themselves.\r\n\r\nThe courts have found it in line with judicial procedure to strike every\r\nweapon from labor’s economic hand and leave it defenseless at the mercy\r\nof its exploiter; and now that the courts have gone to the last\r\nextremity in this nefarious plot of subjugation, labor, at last, is\r\nwaking up to the fact that it has not been using its political arm in\r\nthe struggle at all; that the ballot which it can wield is strong enough\r\nnot only to disarm the enemy, but to drive that enemy entirely from the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nThe courts, so notoriously in control of capital, and so shamelessly\r\nperverted to its base and sordid purposes is, therefore, exercising a\r\nwholesome effect upon trades-unionism by compelling the members to note\r\nthe class character of our capitalist government and driving them to the\r\ninevitable conclusion that the labor question is also a political\r\nquestion and that the working class must organize their political power\r\nthat they may wrest the government from capitalist control and put an\r\nend to class rule forever.\r\n\r\nTrades-unionists for the most part learn slowly, but they learn surely,\r\nand fresh object lessons are prepared for them every day.\r\n\r\nThey have seen a Democratic President of the United States send the\r\nfederal troops into a sovereign state of the Union in violation of the\r\nconstitution, and in defiance of the protest of the governor and the\r\npeople, to crush a body of peaceable workingmen at the behest of a\r\ncombination of railroads bent on destroying their union and reducing\r\nthem to vassalage.\r\n\r\nThey have seen a Republican President refuse to interpose his executive\r\nauthority when militarism, in the name of the capitalist class, seized\r\nanother sovereign state by the throat and strangled its civil\r\nadministration to death while it committed the most dastardly crimes\r\nupon defenseless workingmen in the annals of capitalist brutality and\r\nmilitary despotism.\r\n\r\nThey have seen a composite Republican-Democratic congress, the\r\nlegislative tool of the exploiting class, pass a military bill which\r\nmakes every citizen a soldier and the President a military dictator.\r\n\r\nThey have seen this same congress, session after session, making false\r\npromises to deluded labor committees; pretending to be the friends of\r\nworkingmen and anxious to be of service to them, while at the same time\r\nin league with the capitalist lobby and pledged to defeat every measure\r\nthat would afford even the slightest promise of relief to the working\r\nclass. The anti-injunction bill and the eight hour measure, pigeon-holed\r\nand rejected again and again in the face of repeated promises that they\r\nshould pass, tell their own story of duplicity and treachery to labor of\r\nthe highest legislative body in the land.\r\n\r\nThey have seen Republican governors and Democratic governors order out\r\nthe militia repeatedly to shoot down workingmen at the command of their\r\ncapitalist masters.\r\n\r\nThey have seen these same governors construct military prisons and “bull\r\npens,” seize unoffending workingmen without warrant of law and thrust\r\nthem into these vile quarters for no other reason than to break up their\r\nunions and leave them helpless at the feet of corporate rapacity.\r\n\r\nThey have seen the supreme court of the nation turn labor out without a\r\nhearing, while the corporation lawyers, who compose this august body,\r\nand who hold their commissions in virtue of the “well done” of their\r\ncapitalist retainers, solemnly descant upon the immaculate purity of our\r\njudicial institutions.\r\n\r\nThey have seen state legislatures, both Republican and Democratic, with\r\nnever an exception, controlled bodily by the capitalist class and turn\r\nthe committees of labor unions empty-handed from their doors.\r\n\r\nThey have seen state supreme courts declare as unconstitutional the last\r\nvestige of law upon the statute books that could by any possibility be\r\nconstrued as affording any shelter or relief to the labor union or its\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\nThey have seen these and many other things and will doubtless see many\r\nmore before their eyes are opened as a class; but we are thankful for\r\nthem all, painful though they be to us in having to bear witness to the\r\nsuffering of our benighted brethren.\r\n\r\nIn this way only can they be made to see, to think, to act, and every\r\nwrong they suffer brings them nearer to their liberation.\r\n\r\nThe “pure and simple” trade-union of the past does not answer the\r\nrequirements of today, and they who insist that it does are blind to the\r\nchanges going on about them, and out of harmony with the progressive\r\nforces of the age.\r\n\r\nThe attempt to preserve the “autonomy” of each trade and segregate it\r\nwithin its own independent jurisdiction, while the lines which once\r\nseparated them are being obliterated, and the trades are being\r\ninterwoven and interlocked in the process of industrial evolution, is as\r\nfutile as to declare and attempt to enforce the independence of the\r\nwaves of the sea.\r\n\r\nA modern industrial plant has a hundred trades and parts of trades\r\nrepresented in its working force. To have these workers parcelled out to\r\na hundred unions is to divide and not to organize them, to give them\r\nover to factions and petty leadership and leave them an easy prey to the\r\nmachinations of the enemy. The dominant craft should control the plant\r\nor, rather, the union, and it should embrace the entire working force.\r\nThis is the industrial plan, the modern method applied to modern\r\nconditions, and it will in time prevail.\r\n\r\nThe trade autonomy can be expressed within the general union, so far as\r\nthat is necessary or desirable, and there need be no conflict on account\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nThe attempt of each trade to maintain its own independence separately\r\nand apart from others results in increasing jurisdictional\r\nentanglements, fruitful of dissension, strife and ultimate disruption.\r\n\r\nThe work of organizing has little, if any, permanent value unless the\r\nwork of education, the right kind of education, goes hand in hand with\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThere is no cohesiveness in ignorance.\r\n\r\nThe members of a trade-union should be taught the true import, the whole\r\nobject of the labor movement and understand its entire program.\r\n\r\nThey should know that the labor movement means more, infinitely more,\r\nthan a paltry increase in wages and the strike necessary to secure it;\r\nthat while it engages to do all that possibly can be done to better the\r\nworking conditions of its members, its higher object is to overthrow the\r\ncapitalist system of private ownership of the tools of labor, abolish\r\nwage-slavery and achieve the freedom of the whole working class and, in\r\nfact, of all mankind.\r\n\r\nKarl Marx recognized the necessity of the trade union when he said, * *\r\n* “the general tendency of capitalist production is not to raise, but to\r\nsink the average standard of wages or to push the value of labor more or\r\nless to its minimum limit. Such being the tendency of things in this\r\nsystem, is this saying that the working class ought to renounce their\r\nresistance against the encroachments of capital, and abandon their\r\nattempts at making the best of the occasional chances for their\r\ntemporary improvement? If they did, they would be degraded to one level\r\nmass of broken wretches past salvation. * * * By cowardly giving way in\r\ntheir every-day conflict with capital, they would certainly disqualify\r\nthemselves for the initiating of any larger movement.”\r\n\r\nMarx also set forth the limitations of the trade-union and indicated the\r\ntrue course it should pursue as follows:\r\n\r\n“At the same time, and quite apart from the general servitude involved\r\nin the wage system, the working class ought not to exaggerate to\r\nthemselves the ultimate working of these every-day struggles. They ought\r\nnot to forget that they are fighting with effects, but not with the\r\ncauses of those effects; that they are retarding the downward movement,\r\nbut not changing its direction; that they are applying palliatives, not\r\ncuring the malady. They ought, therefore, not to be exclusively absorbed\r\nin these unavoidable guerilla fights incessantly springing up from the\r\nnever-ceasing encroachments of capital or changes of the market. They\r\nought to understand that, with all the miseries it imposes upon them,\r\nthe present system simultaneously engenders the material conditions and\r\nthe social forms necessary for an economic reconstruction of society.\r\nInstead of the conservative motto, ‘A fair day’s wages for a fair day’s\r\nwork!’ they ought to inscribe on their banner the revolutionary\r\nwatchword, ‘Abolition of the wage system.’ * * * * * *\r\n\r\n“Trades unions work well as centers of resistance against the\r\nencroachments of capital. They fail partially from an injudicious use of\r\ntheir power. They fail generally from limiting themselves to a guerilla\r\nwar against the effects of the existing system, instead of\r\nsimultaneously trying to change it, instead of using their organized\r\nforces as a lever for the final emancipation of the working class, that\r\nis to say, the ultimate abolition of the wage system.”\r\n\r\nIn an address to the Knights of St. Crispin, in April, 1872, Wendell\r\nPhillips, the eloquent orator and passionate hater of slavery in every\r\nform, said:\r\n\r\n“I hail the Labor movement for the reason that it is my only hope for\r\ndemocracy.”\r\n\r\nWendell Phillips was right; he spoke with prophetic insight. He knew\r\nthat the labor movement alone could democratize society and give freedom\r\nto the race.\r\n\r\nIn the same address he uttered these words, which every trade-unionist\r\nshould know by heart:\r\n\r\n“Unless there is a power in your movement, industrially and politically,\r\nthe last knell of democratic liberty in this Union is struck.”\r\n\r\nThe orator then proceeded to emphasize the urgent need of developing the\r\npolitical power of the movement; and it is just this that the\r\ntrade-unionist should be made to clearly understand.\r\n\r\nThe cry, “no politics in the union,” “dragging the union into politics,”\r\nor “making the union the tail of some political kite,” is born of\r\nignorance or dishonesty, or a combination of both. It is echoed by every\r\nward-heeling politician in the country. The plain purpose is to deceive\r\nand mislead the workers.\r\n\r\nIt is not the welfare of the union that these capitalist henchmen are so\r\nmuch concerned about, but the fear that the working class, as a class,\r\norganized into a party of their own, will go into politics, for well\r\nthey know that when that day dawns their occupation will be gone.\r\n\r\nAnd this is why they employ their time in setting the union against the\r\npolitical party of the working class, the only union labor party there\r\never was or ever will be, and warning the members against the evil\r\ndesigns of the socialists.\r\n\r\nThe important thing to impress upon the mind of the trade-unionist is\r\nthat it is his duty to cultivate the habit of doing his own thinking.\r\n\r\nThe moment he realizes this he is beyond the power of the scheming\r\npolitician, the emissary of the exploiter, in or out of the labor\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\nThe trades-union is not and can not become a political machine, nor can\r\nit be used for political purposes. They who insist upon working class\r\npolitical action not only have no intention to convert the trades-union\r\ninto a political party, but they would oppose any such attempt on the\r\npart of others.\r\n\r\nThe trades-union is an economic organization with distinct economic\r\nfunctions and as such is a part, a necessary part, but a part only of\r\nthe Labor Movement; it has its own sphere of activity, its own program\r\nand is its own master within its economic limitations.\r\n\r\nBut the labor movement has also its political side and the\r\ntrades-unionist must be educated to realize its importance and to\r\nunderstand that the political side of the movement must be _unionized_\r\nas well as the economic side; and that he is not in fact a union man at\r\nall who, although a member of the union on the economic side, is a\r\nnon-unionist on the political side; and while striking for, votes\r\nagainst the working class.\r\n\r\nThe trades-union expresses the economic power and the Socialist party\r\nexpresses the political power of the Labor movement.\r\n\r\nThe fully developed labor-unionist uses both his economic and political\r\npower in the interest of his class. He understands that the struggle\r\nbetween labor and capital is a _class_ struggle; that the working class\r\nare in a great majority, but divided, some in trades-unions and some out\r\nof them, some in one political party and some in another; that because\r\nthey are divided they are helpless and must submit to being robbed of\r\nwhat their labor produces, and treated with contempt; that they must\r\nunite their class in the trades-union on the one hand and in the\r\nSocialist party on the other hand; that industrially and politically\r\nthey must act together as a class against the capitalist class and that\r\nthis struggle is a class struggle, and that any workingman who deserts\r\nhis union in a strike and goes to the other side is a scab, and any\r\nworkingman who deserts his party on election day and goes over to the\r\nenemy is a betrayer of his class and an enemy of his fellowman.\r\n\r\nBoth sides are organized in this class struggle, the capitalists,\r\nhowever, far more thoroughly than the workers. In the first place the\r\ncapitalists are, comparatively, few in number, while the workers number\r\nmany millions. Next, the capitalists are men of financial means and\r\nresources, and can buy the best brains and command the highest order of\r\nability the market affords. Then again, they own the earth, and the\r\nmills and mines and locomotives and ships and stores and the jobs that\r\nare attached to them, and this not only gives them tremendous advantage\r\nin the struggle, but makes them for the time the absolute masters of the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nThe workers, on the other hand, are poor as a rule, and ignorant as a\r\nclass, _but they are in an overwhelming majority_. In a word, they have\r\nthe power, but are not conscious of it. This then is the supreme demand;\r\nto make them conscious of the power of their class, or class-conscious\r\nworkingmen.\r\n\r\nThe working class alone does the world’s work, has created its capital,\r\nproduced its wealth, constructed its mills and factories, dug its\r\ncanals, made its roadbeds, laid its rails and operates its trains,\r\nspanned the rivers with bridges and tunnelled the mountains, delved for\r\nthe precious stones that glitter upon the bosom of vulgar idleness and\r\nreared the majestic palaces that shelter insolent parasites.\r\n\r\nThe working class alone—and by the working class I mean all useful\r\nworkers, all who by the labor of their hands or the effort of their\r\nbrains, or both in alliance, as they ought universally to be, increase\r\nthe knowledge and add to the wealth of society—the working class alone\r\nis essential to society and therefore the only class that can survive in\r\nthe world-wide struggle for freedom.\r\n\r\nWe have said that both classes, the capitalist class and the working\r\nclass are organized for the class struggle, but the organization,\r\nespecially that of the workers, is far from complete; indeed, it would\r\nbe nearer exact to say that it has but just fairly begun.\r\n\r\nOn the economic field of the class struggle the capitalists have their\r\nManufacturers’ Association, Citizens’ Alliance, Corporations’ Auxiliary,\r\nand—we must add—Civic Federation, while on the political field they have\r\nthe Republican party and the Democratic party, the former for large\r\ncapitalists and the latter for small capitalists, but both of them for\r\ncapitalists and both against the workers.\r\n\r\nStanding face to face with the above named economic and political forces\r\nof the capitalists the workingmen have on the economic field their\r\ntrades-unions, and on the political field their working class Socialist\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nIn the class struggle the workers must unite and fight together as one\r\non both economic and political fields.\r\n\r\nThe Socialist party is to the workingman politically what the\r\ntrades-union is to him industrially; the former is the party of his\r\nclass, while the latter is the union of his trade.\r\n\r\nThe difference between them is that while the trades-union is confined\r\nto the trade, the Socialist party embraces the entire working class, and\r\nwhile the union is limited to bettering conditions under the wage\r\nsystem, the party is organized to conquer the political power of the\r\nnation, wipe out the wage system and make the workers themselves the\r\nmasters of the earth.\r\n\r\nIn this program, the trades-union and the Socialist party, the economic\r\nand political wings of the labor movement, should not only not be in\r\nconflict, but act together in perfect harmony in every struggle whether\r\nit be on the one field or the other, in the strike or at the ballot box.\r\nThe main thing is that in every such struggle the workers shall be\r\nunited, shall in fact be unionists and no more be guilty of scabbing on\r\ntheir party than on their union, no more think of voting a capitalist\r\nticket on election day and turning the working class over to capitalist\r\nrobbery and misrule than they would think of voting in the union to turn\r\nit over to the capitalists and have it run in the interest of the\r\ncapitalist class.\r\n\r\nTo do its part in the class struggle the trades-union need no more go\r\ninto politics than the Socialist party need go into the trades. Each has\r\nits place and its functions.\r\n\r\nThe union deals with trade problems and the party deals with politics.\r\n\r\nThe union is educating the workers in the management of industrial\r\nactivities and fitting them for co-operative control and democratic\r\nregulation of their trades,—the party is recruiting and training and\r\ndrilling the political army that is to conquer the capitalist forces on\r\nthe political battlefield; and having control of the machinery of\r\ngovernment, use it to transfer the industries from the capitalists to\r\nthe workers, from the parasites to the people.\r\n\r\nIn his excellent paper on “The Social Opportunity,” published in a\r\nrecent issue of the International Socialist Review, Dr. George D.\r\nHerron, discussing trades-unions and their relation to the Socialist\r\nparty, and the labor movement in general, clearly sees the trend of the\r\ndevelopment and arrives at conclusions that are sound and commend\r\nthemselves to the thoughtful consideration of all trades-unionists and\r\nSocialists. Says Dr. Herron:\r\n\r\n“On the one side, it is the trade-unionist who is on the firing line of\r\nthe class struggle. He it is who blocked the wheels of the capitalist\r\nmachine; he it is who has prevented the unchecked development of\r\ncapitalist increase; he it is who has prevented the whole labor body of\r\nthe world from being kept forever at the point of mere hunger wages; he\r\nit is who has taught the workers of the world the lesson of solidarity,\r\nand delivered them from that wretched and unthinking competition with\r\neach other which kept them at the mercy of capitalism; he it is who has\r\nprepared the way for the co-operative commonwealth. On the other hand,\r\ntrade unionism is by no means the solution of the workers’ problem, nor\r\nis it the goal of the labor struggle. It is merely a capitalist line of\r\ndefense within the capitalist system. Its existence and its struggles\r\nare necessitated only by the existence and predatory nature of\r\ncapitalism. * * *\r\n\r\n* * * “Organized labor has an instinct that far outreaches its\r\nintelligence, and that far outreaches the intelligence of the preaching\r\nand teaching class,—the instinct that the workers of the world are bound\r\nup together in one common destiny; that their battle for the future is\r\none; and that there is no possible safety or extrication for any worker\r\nunless all the workers of the world are extricated and saved from\r\ncapitalism together. * * *\r\n\r\n* * * “Until the workers shall become a clearly defined socialist\r\nmovement, standing for and moving toward the unqualified co-operative\r\ncommonwealth, while at the same time understanding and proclaiming their\r\nimmediate interests, they will only play into the hands of their\r\nexploiters, and be led by their betrayers.\r\n\r\n“It is the Socialist who must point this out in the right way. He is not\r\nto do this by seeking to commit trade-union bodies to the principles of\r\nSocialism. Resolution or commitments of this sort accomplish little\r\ngood. Nor is he to do it by taking a servile attitude toward organized\r\nlabor, nor by meddling with the details or the machinery of the\r\ntrade-unions. Not by trying to commit Socialism to trade-unionism, nor\r\ntrade-unionism to Socialism, will the Socialist end be accomplished. It\r\nis better to leave the trade-unions do their distinctive work, as the\r\nworkers’ defense against the encroachments of capitalism, as the\r\neconomic development of the worker against the economic development of\r\nthe capitalist, giving unqualified support and sympathy to the struggles\r\nof the organized worker to sustain himself in his economic sphere. But\r\nlet the Socialist also build up the character and harmony and strength\r\nof the socialist movement as a political force, that it shall command\r\nthe respect and confidence of the worker, irrespective of his trade or\r\nhis union obligations. It is urgent that we so keep in mind the\r\ndifference between the two developments that neither shall cripple the\r\nother. The Socialist movement, as a political development of the workers\r\nfor their economic emancipation, is one thing; the trade-union\r\ndevelopment, as an economic defense of the workers within the capitalist\r\nsystem, is another thing. Let us not interfere with the internal affairs\r\nof the trade-unions, or seek to have them become distinctively political\r\nbodies in themselves, any more than we would seek to make a distinctive\r\npolitical body in itself of a church, or a public school, or a lawyer’s\r\noffice. But let us attend to the harmonious and commanding development\r\nof the Socialist political movement as the channel and power by which\r\nlabor is to come to its emancipation and its commonwealth.”\r\n\r\nWe have quoted thus at length to make clear the position of the writer\r\nwho has given close study to the question and in the paper above quoted\r\nhas done much to light the way to sound tactics and sane procedure.\r\n\r\nIt is of vital importance to the trades-union that its members be\r\nclass-conscious, that they understand the class struggle and their duty\r\nas union men on the political field, so that in every move that is made\r\nthey will have the goal in view, and while taking advantage of every\r\nopportunity to secure concessions and enlarge their economic advantage,\r\nthey will at the same time unite at the ballot box, not only to back up\r\nthe economic struggle of the trades-union, but to finally wrest the\r\ngovernment from capitalist control and establish the working class\r\nrepublic.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               SOCIALISM.\r\n\r\nThere are those who sneeringly class Socialism among the “ism” that\r\nappear and disappear as passing fads, and pretend to dismiss it with an\r\nimpatient wave of the hand. There is just enough in this great world\r\nmovement to them to excite their ridicule and provoke their contempt. At\r\nleast they would have us think so and if we take them at their word\r\ntheir ignorance does not rise to the level of our contempt, but entitles\r\nthem to our pity.\r\n\r\nTo the workingman in particular it is important to know what Socialism\r\nis and what it means.\r\n\r\nLet us endeavor to make it so clear to him that he will readily grasp it\r\nand the moment he does he becomes a Socialist.\r\n\r\nIt is our conviction that no workingman can clearly understand what\r\nSocialism means without becoming and remaining a Socialist. It is simply\r\nimpossible for him to be anything else and the only reason that all\r\nworkingmen are not Socialists is that they do not know what it means.\r\n\r\nThey have heard of Socialism—and they have heard of anarchy and of other\r\nthings all mixed together—and without going to any trouble about it they\r\nconclude that it is all the same thing and a good thing to let alone.\r\n\r\nWhy? Because the capitalist editor has said so; the politician has sworn\r\nto it and the preacher has said amen to it, and surely that ought to\r\nsettle it.\r\n\r\nBut it doesn’t. It settles but one thing and that is that the capitalist\r\nis opposed to Socialism and that the editor and politician and preacher\r\nare but the voices of the capitalist. There are some exceptions, but not\r\nenough to affect the rule.\r\n\r\nSocialism is first of all a political movement of the working class,\r\nclearly defined and uncompromising, which aims at the overthrow of the\r\nprevailing capitalist system by securing control of the national\r\ngovernment and by the exercise of the public powers, supplanting the\r\nexisting capitalist class government with Socialist administration—that\r\nis to say, changing a republic in name into a republic in fact.\r\n\r\nSocialism also means a coming phase of civilization, next in order to\r\nthe present one, in which the collective people will own and operate the\r\nsources and means of wealth production, in which all will have equal\r\nright to work and all will cooperate together in producing wealth and\r\nall will enjoy all the fruit of their collective labor.\r\n\r\nIn the present system of society, called the capitalist system, since it\r\nis controlled by and supported in the interest of the capitalist class,\r\nwe have two general classes of people; first, capitalists, and second,\r\nworkers. The capitalists are few, the workers are many; the capitalists\r\nare called capitalists because they own the productive capital of the\r\ncountry, the lands, mines, quarries, oil and gas wells, mills,\r\nfactories, shops, stores, warehouses, refineries, tanneries, elevators,\r\ndocks, wharves, railroads, street cars, steamships, smelters, blast\r\nfurnaces, brick and stone yards, stock pens, packing houses, telegraph\r\nwires and poles, pipe lines, and all other sources, means and tools of\r\nproduction, distribution and exchange. The capitalist class who own and\r\ncontrol these things also own and control, of course, the millions of\r\njobs that are attached to and inseparable from them.\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying that the owner of the job is the master of the\r\nfellow who depends upon the job.\r\n\r\nNow why does the workingman depend upon the capitalist for a job? Simply\r\nbecause the capitalist owns the tools with which work is done, and\r\nwithout these the workingman is almost as helpless as if he had no arms.\r\n\r\nBefore the tool became a machine, the worker who used it also owned it;\r\nif one was lost or destroyed he got another. The tool was small; it was\r\nfor individual use and what the workingman produced with it was his own.\r\nHe did not have to beg some one else to allow him to use his tools—he\r\nhad his own.\r\n\r\nBut a century has passed since then, and in the order of progress that\r\nsimple tool has become a mammoth machine.\r\n\r\nThe old hand tool was used by a single worker—and owned by him who used\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe machine requires a thousand or ten thousand workers to operate it,\r\nbut they do not own it, and what they produce with it does not go to\r\nthem, but to the capitalist who does own it.\r\n\r\nThe workers who use the machine are the slaves of the capitalist who\r\nowns it.\r\n\r\nThey can only work by his permission.\r\n\r\nThe capitalist is a capitalist solely for profit—without profit he would\r\nnot be in business an instant. That is his first and only consideration.\r\n\r\nIn the capitalist system profit is prior to and more important than the\r\nlife or liberty of the workingman.\r\n\r\nThe capitalist’s profit first, last and always. He owns the tools and\r\nonly allows the worker to use them on condition that he can extract a\r\nsatisfactory profit from his labor. If he cannot do this the tools are\r\nnot allowed to be used—he locks them up and waits.\r\n\r\nThe capitalist does no work himself; that is, no useful or necessary\r\nwork. He spends his time watching other parasites in the capitalist game\r\nof “dog eat dog,” or in idleness or dissipation. The workers who use his\r\ntools give him all the wealth they produce and he allows them a\r\nsufficient wage to keep them in working order.\r\n\r\nThe wage is to the worker what oil is to the machine.\r\n\r\nThe machine cannot run without lubricant and the worker cannot work and\r\nreproduce himself without being fed, clothed and housed; this is his\r\nlubricant and the amount he requires to keep him in running order\r\nregulates his wage.\r\n\r\nKarl Marx, in his “Wage, Labor and Capital,” makes these points clear in\r\nhis own terse and masterly style. We quote as follows:\r\n\r\n“The free laborer sells himself, and that by fractions. From day to day\r\nhe sells by auction, eight, ten, twelve, fifteen hours of his life to\r\nthe highest bidder—to the owner of the raw material, the instruments of\r\nwork and the means of life; that is, to the employer. The laborer\r\nhimself belongs neither to an owner nor to the soil; but eight, ten,\r\ntwelve, fifteen hours of his daily life belong to the man who buys them.\r\nThe laborer leaves the employer to whom he has hired himself whenever he\r\npleases; and the employer discharges him whenever he thinks fit; either\r\nas soon as he ceases to make a profit out of him or fails to get as high\r\na profit as he requires. But the laborer whose only source of earning is\r\nthe sale of his labor power cannot leave _the whole class of its\r\npurchasers_, that is the capitalist class, without renouncing his own\r\nexistence. He does not belong to this or that particular employer, but\r\nhe does belong to the _capitalist class_; and more than that: it is his\r\nbusiness to find an employer; that is, among this capitalist class it is\r\nhis business to discover _his own particular purchaser_.”\r\n\r\nComing to the matter of wages and how they are determined, Marx\r\ncontinues:\r\n\r\n“Wages are the price of a certain commodity, labor-power. Wages are thus\r\ndetermined by the same law which regulates the price of any other\r\ncommodity.\r\n\r\n“Thereupon the question arises, how is the price of a commodity\r\ndetermined?\r\n\r\n“By means of competition between buyers and sellers and the relations\r\nbetween supply and demand—offer and desire.\r\n\r\n“* * * Now the same general laws which universally regulate the price of\r\ncommodities, regulate, of course, _wages, the price of labor_.\r\n\r\n“Wages will rise and fall in accordance with the proportion between\r\ndemand and supply; that is, in accordance with the conditions of the\r\ncompetition between capitalists as buyers and laborers as sellers of\r\nlabor. The fluctuations of wages correspond in general with the\r\nfluctuation in the price of commodities. _Within these fluctuations the\r\nprice of labor is regulated by its cost of production; that is, by the\r\nduration of labor which is required in order to produce this commodity,\r\nlabor power._\r\n\r\n_“Now what is the cost of production of labor power?_\r\n\r\n_“It is the cost required for the production of a laborer and for his\r\nmaintenance as a laborer._\r\n\r\n_“* * * The price of his labor is therefore determined by the price of\r\nthe bare necessaries of his existence._”\r\n\r\nThis is the capitalist system in its effect upon the working class. They\r\nhave no tools, but must work to live. They throng the labor market,\r\nespecially when times are hard and work is scarce, and eagerly,\r\nanxiously look for some one willing to use their labor power and bid\r\nthem in at the market price.\r\n\r\nTo speak of liberty in such a system is a mockery; to surrender is a\r\ncrime.\r\n\r\nThe workers of the nation and the world must be aroused.\r\n\r\nIn the capitalist system “night has drawn her sable curtain down and\r\npinned it with a star,” and the great majority grope in darkness. The\r\npin must be removed from the curtain, even though it be a star.\r\n\r\nBut the darkness, after all, is but imaginary. The sun is marching to\r\nmeridian glory and the world is flooded with light.\r\n\r\nCharlotte Perkins Stetson, the inspired evangel of the coming\r\ncivilization, says:\r\n\r\n                 “We close our eyes and call it night,\r\n                 And grope and fall in seas of light,\r\n                 Would we but understand!”\r\n\r\nNot for a moment do we despair of the future. The greatest educational\r\npropaganda ever known is spreading over the earth.\r\n\r\nThe working class will both see and understand. They have the inherent\r\npower of self-development. They are but just beginning to come into\r\nconsciousness of their power, and with the first glimmerings of this\r\nconsciousness the capitalist system is doomed. It may hold on for a\r\ntime, for even a long time, but its doom is sealed.\r\n\r\nEven now the coming consciousness of this world-wide working class power\r\nis shaking the foundations of all governments and all civilizations.\r\n\r\nThe capitalist system has had its day and, like other systems that have\r\ngone before, it must pass away when it has fulfilled its mission and\r\nmade room for another system more in harmony with the forces of progress\r\nand with the onward march of civilization.\r\n\r\nThe centralization of capital, the concentration of industry and the\r\nco-operation of workingmen mark the beginning of the end. Competition is\r\nno longer “the life of trade.” Only they are clamoring for “competition”\r\nwho have been worsted in the struggle and would like to have another\r\ndeal.\r\n\r\nThe small class who won out in the game of competition and own the\r\ntrusts want no more of it. They know what it is, and have had enough.\r\nMr. John D. Rockefeller needs no competition to give life to his trade,\r\nand his pious son does not expatiate upon the beauties of competition in\r\nhis class at Sunday school.\r\n\r\nNo successful capitalist wants competition—for himself—he only wants it\r\nfor the working class, so that he can buy his labor power at the lowest\r\ncompetitive price in the labor market.\r\n\r\nThe simple truth is, that competition in industrial life belongs to the\r\npast, and is practically outgrown. The time is approaching when it will\r\nbe no longer possible.\r\n\r\nThe improvement and enlargement of machinery, and the ever-increasing\r\nscale of production compel the concentration of capital and this makes\r\ninevitable the concentration and co-operation of the workers.\r\n\r\nThe capitalists—the successful ones, of course,—co-operate on the one\r\nside; the workers—who are lucky enough to get the jobs—on the other\r\nside.\r\n\r\nOne side gets the profit, grow rich, live in palaces, ride in yachts,\r\ngamble at Monte Carlo, drink champagne, choose judges, buy editors, hire\r\npreachers, corrupt politics, build universities, endow libraries,\r\npatronize churches, get the gout, preach morals and bequeath the earth\r\nto their lineal descendants.\r\n\r\nThe other side do the work, early and late, in heat and cold; they sweat\r\nand groan and bleed and die—the steel billets they make are their\r\ncorpses. They build the mills and all the machinery; they man the plant\r\nand the thing of stone and steel begins to throb. They live far away in\r\nthe outskirts, in cottages, just this side of the hovels, where gaunt\r\nfamine walks with despair and “Les Miserables” leer and mock at\r\ncivilization. When the mills shut down, they are out of work and out of\r\nfood and out of home; and when old age begins to steal away their vigor\r\nand the step is no longer agile, nor the sinew strong, nor the hand\r\ncunning; when the frame begins to bend and quiver and the eye to grow\r\ndim, and they are no longer fit as labor power to make profit for their\r\nmasters, they are pushed aside into the human drift that empties into\r\nthe gulf of despair and death.\r\n\r\nThe system, once adapted to human needs, has outlived its usefulness and\r\nis now an unmitigated curse. It stands in the way of progress and checks\r\nthe advance of civilization.\r\n\r\nIf by its fruit we know the tree, so by the same token do we know our\r\nsocial system. Its corrupt fruit betrays its foul and unclean nature and\r\ncondemns it to death.\r\n\r\nThe swarms of vagrants, tramps, outcasts, paupers, thieves, gamblers,\r\npickpockets, suicides, confidence men, fallen women, consumptives,\r\nidiots, dwarfed children; the disease, poverty, insanity and crime\r\nrampant in every land under the sway of capitalism rise up and cry out\r\nagainst it, and hush to silence all the pleas of its _mercenaries_ and\r\nstrike the knell of its doom.\r\n\r\nThe ancient and middle-age civilizations had their rise, they ruled and\r\nfell, and that of our own day must follow them.\r\n\r\nEvolution is the order of nature, and society, like the units that\r\ncompose it, is subject to its inexorable law.\r\n\r\nThe day of individual effort, of small tools, free competition, hand\r\nlabor, long hours and meagre results is gone never to return. The\r\ncivilization reared upon this old foundation is crumbling.\r\n\r\nThe economic basis of society is being transformed.\r\n\r\nThe working class are being knit together in the bonds of co-operation,\r\nthey are becoming conscious of their interests as a class, and\r\nmarshalling the workers for the class struggle and collective ownership.\r\n\r\nWith the triumph of the workers the mode of production and distribution\r\nwill be completely revolutionized.\r\n\r\nPrivate ownership and production for profit will be supplanted by social\r\nownership and production for use.\r\n\r\nThe economic interests of the workers will be mutual. They will work\r\ntogether in harmony instead of being arrayed against each other in\r\ncompetitive warfare.\r\n\r\nThe collective workers will own the machinery of production, and there\r\nwill be work for all and all will receive their socially due share of\r\nthe product of their co-operative labor.\r\n\r\nIt is for this great work that the workers and their sympathizers must\r\norganize and educate and agitate.\r\n\r\nThe Socialist movement is of the working class itself; it is from the\r\ninjustice perpetrated upon, and the misery suffered by this class that\r\nthe movement sprang, and it is to this class it makes its appeal. It is\r\nthe voice of awakened labor arousing itself to action.\r\n\r\nAs we look abroad and see things as they are, the capitalists intrenched\r\nand fortified and the workers impoverished, ignorant and in bondage, we\r\nare apt to be overawed by the magnitude of the task that lies before the\r\nSocialist movement, but as we become grounded in the Socialist\r\nphilosophy, as we understand the process of economic determinism and\r\ngrasp the principles of industrial and social evolution the magnitude of\r\nthe undertaking, far from daunting the Socialist spirit, appeals to each\r\ncomrade to enlist in the struggle because of the very greatness of the\r\nconflict and the immeasurable good that lies beyond it, and as he girds\r\nhimself and touches elbows with his comrades his own latent resources\r\nare developed and his blood thrills with new life as he feels himself\r\nrising to the majesty of a man.\r\n\r\nNow he has found his true place, and though he be reviled against and\r\nostracized, traduced and denounced, though he be reduced to rags, and\r\ntormented with hunger pangs, he will bear it all and more, for he is\r\nbattling for a principle, he has been consecrated to a cause and he\r\ncannot turn back.\r\n\r\nTo reach the workers that are still in darkness and to open their eyes,\r\nthat is the task, and to this we must give ourselves with all the\r\nstrength we have, with patience that never fails and an abiding faith in\r\nthe ultimate victory.\r\n\r\nThe moment a worker sees himself in his true light he severs his\r\nrelations with the capitalist parties, for he realizes at once that he\r\nno more belongs there than Rockefeller belongs in the Socialist party.\r\n\r\nWhat is the actual status of the workingman in the capitalist society of\r\ntoday?\r\n\r\nIs he in any true sense a citizen?\r\n\r\nHas he any basis for the claim that he is a free man?\r\n\r\nFirst of all, he cannot work unless some capitalist finds it to his\r\ninterest to employ him.\r\n\r\nWhy not? Because he has no tools and man cannot work without them.\r\n\r\nWhy has he no tools? Because tools in these days are, as a rule, great\r\nmachines and very costly, and in the capitalist system are the private\r\nproperty of the capitalists.\r\n\r\nThis being true, the workingman, before he can do a tap of work, before\r\nhe can earn a dime to feed himself, his wife or his child, must first\r\nconsult the tool-owning capitalist; or, rather, his labor-buying\r\nsuperintendent. Very meekly, therefore, and not without fear in his\r\nheart and trembling in his knees, he enters the office and offers his\r\nlabor power in exchange for a wage that represents but a part, usually a\r\nsmall part, of what his labor produces.\r\n\r\nHis offer may be accepted or rejected.\r\n\r\nNot infrequently the “boss” has been annoyed by so many job-hunters that\r\nhe has become irritable, and gruffly turns the applicant away.\r\n\r\nBut admitting that he finds employment, during working hours he is\r\nvirtually the property of his master.\r\n\r\nThe bell or the whistle claims him on the stroke of the hour. He is\r\nsubject to the master’s shop regulations and these, of course, are\r\nestablished solely to conserve his master’s interests. He works, first\r\nof all, for his master, who extracts the surplus value from his labor,\r\nbut for which he would not be allowed to work at all. He has little or\r\nno voice in determining any of the conditions of his employment.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, without warning, the shop closes down, or he is discharged and\r\nhis wage, small at best, is cut off. He has to live, the rent must be\r\npaid, the wife and children must have clothing and food, fuel must be\r\nprovided, and yet he has no job, no wages and no prospect of getting\r\nany.\r\n\r\nIs a worker in that position free?\r\n\r\nIs he a citizen?\r\n\r\nA man?\r\n\r\nNo! He is simply a wage-slave, a job-holder, while it lasts, here today\r\nand gone tomorrow.\r\n\r\nFor the great body of wage-workers there is no escape; they cannot rise\r\nabove the level of their class. The few who do are the exceptions that\r\nprove the rule.\r\n\r\nAnd yet there are those who have the effrontery to warn these\r\nwage-slaves that if they turn to Socialism they will lose all incentive\r\nto work, and their individuality will fade away.\r\n\r\nIncentive and individuality forsooth! Where are they now?\r\n\r\nTranslated into plain terms, this warning means that a slave who is\r\nrobbed of all he produces, except enough to keep him in producing\r\ncondition, as in the present system, has great incentive to work and is\r\nhighly individualized, but if he breaks his fetters and frees himself\r\nand becomes his own master and gets all his labor produces, as he will\r\nin Socialism, then all incentive to work vanishes, and his\r\nindividuality, so used to chains and dungeons, unable to stand the air\r\nof freedom, withers away and is lost forever.\r\n\r\nThe capitalists and their emissaries who resort to such crude attempts\r\nat deception and imposture betray the low estimate they place on the\r\nintelligence of their wage-workers and also show that they fully\r\nunderstand to what depths of ignorance and credulity these slaves have\r\nsunk in the wage-system.\r\n\r\nIn the light of existing conditions there can be no reform that will be\r\nof any great or permanent benefit to the working class.\r\n\r\nThe present system of private ownership must be abolished and the\r\nworkers themselves made the owners of the tools with which they work,\r\nand to accomplish this they must organize their class for political\r\naction and this work is already well under way in the Socialist party,\r\nwhich is composed of the working class and stands for the working class\r\non a revolutionary platform, which declares in favor of the collective\r\nownership of the means of production and the democratic management of\r\nindustry in the interest of the whole people.\r\n\r\nWhat intelligent workingman can hold out against the irresistible claim\r\nthe Socialist movement has upon him? What reason has he to give? What\r\nexcuse can he offer?\r\n\r\nNone! Not one!\r\n\r\nThe only worker who has an excuse to keep out of the socialist movement\r\nis the unfortunate fellow who is ignorant and does not know better. He\r\ndoes not know what Socialism is. That is his misfortune. But that is not\r\nall, nor the worst of all. He thinks he knows what it is.\r\n\r\nIn his ignorance he has taken the word of another for it, whose interest\r\nit is to keep him in darkness. So he continues to march with the\r\nRepublican party or shout with the Democratic party, and he no more\r\nknows why he is a Republican or Democrat than he knows why he is not a\r\nSocialist.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for a workingman to contemplate the situation and the\r\noutlook and have any intelligent conception of the trend and meaning of\r\nthings without becoming a Socialist.\r\n\r\nConsider for a moment the beastly debasement to which womanhood is\r\nsubjected in capitalist society. She is simply the property of man to be\r\ngoverned by him as may suit his convenience. She does not vote, she has\r\nno voice and must bear silent witness to her legally ordained\r\ninferiority.\r\n\r\nShe has to compete with man in the factories and workshops and stores,\r\nand her inferiority is taken advantage of to make her work at still\r\nlower wages than the male slave gets who works at her side.\r\n\r\nAs an economic dependent, she is compelled to sacrifice the innate\r\nrefinement, the inherent purity and nobility of her sex, and for a\r\npallet of straw she marries the man she does not love.\r\n\r\nThe debauching effect of the capitalist system upon womanhood is\r\naccurately registered in the divorce court and the house of shame.\r\n\r\nIn Socialism, woman would stand forth the equal of man—all the avenues\r\nwould be open to her and she would naturally find her fitting place and\r\nrise from the low plane of menial servility to the dignity of ideal\r\nwomanhood.\r\n\r\nBreathing the air of economic freedom, amply able to provide for herself\r\nin Socialist society, we may be certain that the cruel injustice that is\r\nnow perpetrated upon her sex and the degradation that results from it\r\nwill disappear forever.\r\n\r\nConsider again the barren prospect of the average boy who faces the\r\nworld today. If he is the son of a workingman his father is able to do\r\nbut little in the way of giving him a start.\r\n\r\nHe does not get to college, nor even to the high school, but has to be\r\nsatisfied with what he can get in the lower grades, for as soon as he\r\nhas physical growth enough to work he must find something to do, so that\r\nhe may help support the family.\r\n\r\nHis father has no influence and can get no preferred employment for him\r\nat the expense of some other boy, so he thankfully accepts any kind of\r\nservice that he may be allowed to perform.\r\n\r\nHow hard it is to find a place for that boy of yours!\r\n\r\nWhat shall we do with Johnnie? and Nellie? is the question of the\r\nanxious mother long before they are ripe for the labor market.\r\n\r\n“The child is weak, you know,” continues the nervous, loving little\r\nmother, “and can’t do hard work; and I feel dreadfully worried about\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\nWhat a picture! Yet so common that the multitude do not see it. This\r\nmother, numbered by thousands many times over, instinctively understands\r\nthe capitalist system, feels its cruelty and dreads its approaching\r\nhorrors which cast their shadows upon her tender, loving heart.\r\n\r\nNothing can be sadder than to see a mother take the boy she bore by the\r\nhand and start to town with him to peddle him off as merchandise to some\r\none who has use for a child-slave.\r\n\r\nTo know just how that feels one must have had precisely that experience.\r\n\r\nThe mother looks down so fondly and caressingly upon her boy; and he\r\nlooks up into her eyes so timidly and appealingly as she explains his\r\ngood points to the business man or factory boss, who in turn inspects\r\nthe lad and interrogates him to verify his mother’s claims, and finally\r\ninforms them that they may call again the following week, but that he\r\ndoes not think he can use the boy.\r\n\r\nWell, what finally becomes of the boy? He is now grown, his mother’s\r\nworry is long since ended, as the grass grows green where she sleeps—and\r\nhe, the boy? Why, he’s a factory hand—a _hand_, mind you, and he gets a\r\ndollar and a quarter a day when the factory is running.\r\n\r\nThat is all he will ever get.\r\n\r\nHe is an industrial life prisoner—no pardoning power for him in the\r\ncapitalist system.\r\n\r\nNo sweet home, no beautiful wife, no happy children, no books, no\r\nflowers, no pictures, no comrades, no love, no joy for him.\r\n\r\nJust a hand! A human factory hand!\r\n\r\nThink of a hand with a soul in it!\r\n\r\nIn the capitalist system the soul has no business. It cannot produce\r\nprofit by any process of capitalist calculation.\r\n\r\nThe working hand is what is needed for the capitalist’s tool and so the\r\nhuman must be reduced to a hand.\r\n\r\nNo head, no heart, no soul—simply a hand.\r\n\r\nA thousand hands to one brain—the hands of workingmen, the brain of a\r\ncapitalist.\r\n\r\nA thousand dumb animals, in human form—a thousand slaves in the fetters\r\nof ignorance, their heads having run to hands—all these owned and worked\r\nand fleeced by one stock-dealing, profit-mongering capitalist.\r\n\r\nThis is capitalism!\r\n\r\nAnd this system is supported alternately by the Republican party and the\r\nDemocratic party.\r\n\r\nThese two capitalist parties relieve each other in support of the\r\ncapitalist system, while the capitalist system relieves the working\r\nclass of what they produce.\r\n\r\nA thousand hands to one head is the abnormal development of the\r\ncapitalist system.\r\n\r\nA thousand workingmen turned into hands to develop and gorge and\r\ndecorate one capitalist paunch!\r\n\r\nThis brutal order of things must be overthrown. The human race was not\r\nborn to degeneracy.\r\n\r\nA thousand heads have grown for every thousand pairs of hands; a\r\nthousand hearts throb in testimony of the unity of heads and hands; and\r\na thousand souls, though crushed and mangled, burn in protest and are\r\npledged to redeem a thousand men.\r\n\r\nHeads and hands, hearts and souls, are the heritage of all.\r\n\r\nFull opportunity for full development is the unalienable right of all.\r\n\r\nHe who denies it is a tyrant; he who does not demand it is a coward; he\r\nwho is indifferent to it is a slave; he who does not desire it is dead.\r\n\r\nThe earth for all the people! That is the demand.\r\n\r\nThe machinery of production and distribution for all the people! That is\r\nthe demand.\r\n\r\nThe collective ownership and control of industry and its democratic\r\nmanagement in the interest of all the people! That is the demand.\r\n\r\nThe elimination of rent, interest and profit and the production of\r\nwealth to satisfy the wants of all the people! That is the demand.\r\n\r\nCo-operative industry in which all shall work together in harmony as the\r\nbasis of a new social order, a higher civilization, a real republic!\r\nThat is the demand.\r\n\r\nThe end of class struggles and class rule, of master and slave, of\r\nignorance and vice, of poverty and shame, of cruelty and crime—the birth\r\nof freedom, the dawn of brotherhood, the beginning of MAN! That is the\r\ndemand.\r\n\r\nThis is Socialism!\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Reply to John Mitchell\r\n\r\nThe fifteenth annual convention of the United Mine Workers of America\r\nmet at Indianapolis, Ind., January 18 and continued in session to and\r\nincluding January 27, 1904.\r\n\r\nThe regular convention was followed by a special session (from March 5\r\nto March 7 inclusive), made necessary by the failure of the regular\r\nconvention to effect a satisfactory renewal of the interstate agreement\r\nwith the operators, which expired March 31, 1904.\r\n\r\nFor a time a strike seemed imminent, there being intense opposition to\r\nthe wage-reduction which the operators declared to be their ultimatum.\r\n\r\nThe convention rejected the ultimatum of the operators, but the matter\r\nwas finally referred to the local unions, and the latter, yielding to\r\nthe importunities of the national officers, voted to accept the terms of\r\nthe operators, and the threatened strike was averted.\r\n\r\nA few days later Eugene V. Debs wrote the following letter in reference\r\nto the matter which appeared in the _Social Democratic Herald_ of\r\nMilwaukee, Wis., in its issue of April 9, 1904:\r\n\r\n                                        MR. DEBS.\r\n\r\n                                      Terre Haute, Ind., March 31, 1904.\r\n\r\n _To the S. D. Herald_:\r\n\r\nNow that the threatened coal strike has ended in a tame surrender, and a\r\ntwo years’ scale at a reduction of wages has been virtually forced upon\r\nthe miners by a coalition of their leaders with the operators, a certain\r\nsmall and obscure press dispatch—a mere word to the wise, yet sufficient\r\nat the time—takes on immense interest in its prophetic significance.\r\n\r\nThe delegates to the late Indianapolis convention of miners whom I had\r\noccasion to address, will no doubt remember my words, and those who were\r\nangered because I told them in plain terms what has since come true\r\nalmost to the letter, will perhaps be willing to forgive me.\r\n\r\nBut to the dispatch. Here it is just as it was sent out by the\r\nAssociated Press from Pittsburg under date of March 6 and just as it\r\nappeared in the morning dailies of the same date:\r\n\r\n“Pittsburg, Pa., March 6.—The Post tomorrow will say:\r\n\r\n“There was by no means a hopeless spirit among the returning coal\r\noperators from the Indianapolis convention with the miners which closed\r\nSaturday with a disagreement.\r\n\r\n“From the best of authority the Post was informed yesterday that the\r\nbreak in the negotiations between the two interests is not a permanent\r\none and that by March 21, another meeting of joint sub-committees will\r\nbe held quietly. The whole matter will again be discussed among them and\r\na solution to the present difficulty sought. It was further said that\r\nthere was every reason for believing that the ultimate end of the whole\r\nmatter would be the acceptance of the lower rate by the miners, or the\r\n85 cents a ton base for pick mining, for the next two years.”\r\n\r\nHere we have it that the operators knew in advance that there would be\r\nno strike and that the miners would accept the reduction, and this they\r\nknew notwithstanding the fact that the convention, by a solid vote of\r\nthe states, had refused to accept the reduction and virtually declared\r\nfor a strike.\r\n\r\nLet us examine the situation a moment. The joint convention of miners\r\nand operators adjourned sine die March 5. No agreement had been reached.\r\nAll negotiations were ended. A strike, so the papers declared, was\r\ninevitable. Only a miracle could prevent it.\r\n\r\nThe miners and operators returned to their homes. Preparations began for\r\nwar. It was at this juncture that the above dispatch went out from\r\nPittsburg. It was doubtless intended as a “tip” to the capitalists and\r\nstock gamblers of the country, and was issued immediately upon the\r\nreturn of the Pennsylvania operators from the Indianapolis convention.\r\n\r\nPittsburg, be it remembered, is the home of President Robbins of the\r\nPittsburg Coal Co. and floor leader and spokesman of the operators in\r\nall joint conventions with the miners. It is quite evident, therefore,\r\nthat “the best of authority” quoted in the above dispatch was none other\r\nthan Robbins and it is equally evident that he knew what he was talking\r\nabout, for his prediction of surrender, made in face of the fact that\r\nthe national convention had virtually declared for war, was fulfilled to\r\nthe letter.\r\n\r\nThe question is, did Robbins, chief of the operators, have an\r\nunderstanding with Mitchell, president of the miners? It must be\r\nadmitted that it looks that way. Proof may be lacking, but the\r\ncircumstances combine to make that conclusion almost inevitable.\r\n\r\nWhen the miners first met in convention President Mitchell and the other\r\nleaders were quite aggressive. They were going to sweep all opposition\r\nbefore them and get what they wanted, for they had an organization that\r\ncould and would carry the day.\r\n\r\nA set of demands, including increased wages, was at once formulated and\r\nthe performance began. Mitchell, taking the floor for the miners, proved\r\nby the facts and figures that they were asking only what was reasonable,\r\nthat the financial reports of the coal companies showed large increase\r\nin profits over the preceding years, that the operators could well\r\nafford to make the concessions and that they, the miners, were “terribly\r\nin earnest” and that the United Mine Workers of America would under no\r\npossible circumstances “take a backward step.”\r\n\r\nAs the fight progressed the leaders of the miners made one concession\r\nafter another until they had finally surrendered everything. But the\r\noperators were not satisfied. They had come with love in their hearts\r\nand a made-to-order, warranted-to-fit reduction of wages in their grips,\r\njust because they were all in the same economic class and their\r\ninterests were therefore identical, and to prove it they permitted their\r\nown leaders to scale down the bulging wages of the opulent coal diggers.\r\n\r\nBut the delegates, having given up everything, balked at last. Even\r\nMitchell’s “masterful effort” in behalf of the operators fell flat.\r\n\r\nThe reduction would not go down.\r\n\r\nThe convention voted to fight and the delegates went home to prepare for\r\nhostilities.\r\n\r\nNow read the dispatch again in the light of what followed.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the convention adjourned, the leaders of the miners began to\r\nwork upon the rank and file, very many of whom are so pitifully ignorant\r\nthat they look upon a union official as a Chinaman does upon his Joss.\r\n\r\nPresident Mitchell, from being “terribly in earnest” in behalf of the\r\nminers, became the special pleader of the operators.\r\n\r\nOh, what a transformation!\r\n\r\nMitchell, the labor leader, and Robbins, the labor exploiter, pooling\r\nissues and joining hands to force down the wages of the mine slaves!\r\n\r\nOh, what a spectacle!\r\n\r\nWith all possible haste the national and state leaders made their rounds\r\namong the faithful. The “dangerous” locals and districts were all\r\nvisited and mass meetings held to save the operators.\r\n\r\nThe slaves had instinctively rebelled against the wage cut, and the\r\nrebellion must be put down by their own leaders if they expected the\r\nplaudits of the capitalist exploiters and the “well done” of the pulpit,\r\npress and “public.”\r\n\r\nAlternate pleas, warnings and threats were turned on until the fires\r\nwere put out and the day was saved for the operators.\r\n\r\nOnly a little while ago Gompers warned the capitalists that reduction of\r\nwages would not be tolerated and solemnly enjoined his followers to\r\nresist them to the last.\r\n\r\nMitchell, Shaffer and other lieutenants of Gompers are the active allies\r\nof the capitalists in enforcing reductions.\r\n\r\nWatch the developments!\r\n\r\nTo conclude: The United Mine Workers of America has been struck by\r\nlightning.\r\n\r\n                                                         EUGENE V. DEBS.\r\n\r\nThis letter was answered by Mr. John Mitchell and his colleagues in a\r\ncommunication which appeared in the same paper on May 21, 1904, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n                            MR. MITCHELL AND HIS COLLEAGUES.\r\n\r\n                                        Indianapolis, Ind., May 7, 1904.\r\n\r\n _Editor Social-Democratic Herald_:\r\n\r\nIn your issue of April 9 you publish an article over the signature of\r\nEugene V. Debs containing a mass of misstatements with the apparent\r\npurpose of making your readers believe that the officials of the United\r\nMine Workers of America, and particularly President Mitchell, have\r\nbetrayed the trust reposed in them by their constituents by using their\r\nofficial position for the benefit of the employers instead of for the\r\nwelfare of the employes.\r\n\r\nMr. Debs’ knowledge of mining affairs is limited, by virtue of his lack\r\nof time and opportunity for personal investigation, and must of\r\nnecessity be general and superficial. He has not sufficient knowledge of\r\nthe mining industry to be a competent critic of our trade politics, and\r\nyet, if he had confined himself to a criticism of those policies, they\r\nmight have passed unchallenged, so far as we are concerned. But when,\r\nwithout investigation of the facts, he takes an Associated Press\r\ndispatch, distorts it to suit his own purpose and jumbles it up with a\r\nnumber of other things that never existed except in his own diseased\r\nimagination, in order to prove that the officials of the United Mine\r\nWorkers are dishonest, we believe that justice to ourselves and the\r\norganization we represent demands that his statements shall be refuted\r\nand his purpose laid bare.\r\n\r\nMen of experience in the labor movement usually pass by, unheeded, the\r\ninsinuations circulated by the paid agents of capital for the purpose of\r\ndestroying their influence and weakening the power of resistance of\r\ntheir organization, but, when those insinuations are uttered and\r\ncirculated by a man who for years has leaned upon the sympathies of the\r\nwage workers as the crucified martyr of a lost cause, the halo of glory\r\nhe has painted about himself cannot shield him from the contempt of\r\nhonest men. What is this wonderful press dispatch around which Mr. Debs’\r\nimagination has built such a magnificent net work? We reproduce it from\r\nhis own article:\r\n\r\n                                         “Pittsburg, Pa., March 6, 1904.\r\n\r\n“There was by no means a hopeless spirit among the returning coal\r\noperators from the Indianapolis convention which the miners closed\r\nSaturday with a disagreement.\r\n\r\n“From the best authority the Post was informed yesterday that the break\r\nin the negotiations between the two interests is not a permanent one and\r\nthat by March 21, another meeting of joint sub-committees will be held\r\nquietly. The whole matter will again be discussed among them and a\r\nsolution to the present difficulty sought. It was further said that\r\nthere was every reason for believing that the ultimate end of the whole\r\nmatter would be the acceptance of the lower rate by the miners, or the\r\n85 cents a ton base for pick mining for the next two years.”\r\n\r\n“Here,” says Mr. Debs, “we have it that the operators knew in advance\r\nthat there would be no strike.” That statement is false. The dispatch\r\ndoes not assert that the operators knew there would be no strike and\r\nnothing but a warped mind could so construe it. The United Mine Workers’\r\nconvention on March 7 passed a resolution submitting the acceptance or\r\nrejection of the ultimatum of the operators to a referendum vote of the\r\nmembers affected. The vote was taken on the afternoon of March 15. It\r\nwas sent by the local tellers in sealed envelopes to national\r\nheadquarters, and these envelopes were not opened until the national\r\ntellers opened them on March 17. It would have been impossible for the\r\nPittsburg correspondent, Frank Robbins, John Mitchell, or even the\r\nversatile and prophetic Mr. Debs to have known on March 6 what the\r\nresult of that vote would be.\r\n\r\nThat is misstatement No. 1 refuted.\r\n\r\nIn a subsequent interview in the Terre Haute _Sunday Tribune_ Mr. Debs\r\ndares anyone to put his finger on a single word that is not true or deny\r\na single allegation. There is scarcely a truthful statement in the\r\nentire article. Let us be specific. The joint convention of Miners and\r\nOperators adjourned sine die March 5. No agreement had been reached, but\r\nnegotiations were not broken off as asserted by Mr. Debs. When it became\r\napparent that the operators would not move from their final proposition\r\nof five and fifty-five one hundredths per cent reduction, and the miners\r\nmust either accept that proposition or strike, the sub-scale committee,\r\ncomposed of two delegates from each of the four states represented,\r\nselected by the representatives from those states, and eight operators\r\nselected in a similar manner, publicly withdrew from the conference for\r\na few minutes and held a consultation. As the miners had not yet decided\r\nupon their line of policy and might not be able to do so for some time,\r\nit was decided that the scale committee should re-convene on March 21 at\r\nwhich time the operators would be notified whether the miners had\r\ndecided to strike or not. Consequently negotiations were continued.\r\n\r\nThat is misstatement No. 2 refuted.\r\n\r\nMr. Debs says, “The miners and operators returned to their homes.\r\nPreparations began for war. It was at this juncture that the above\r\ndispatch went out from Pittsburg.”\r\n\r\nThe dispatch was sent out from Pittsburg March 6. The miners’ convention\r\ndid not adjourn until March 7 and the delegates could not have been at\r\nhome preparing for war at the time alleged.\r\n\r\nThat is misstatement No. 3 refuted.\r\n\r\nAgain Mr. Debs says, “Pittsburg, be it remembered, is the home of\r\nPresident Robbins of the Pittsburg Coal Co. and the floor leader and\r\nspokesman of the operators in all the joint conventions with the miners.\r\nIt is quite evident, therefore, that ‘the best authority,’ quoted in the\r\nabove dispatch, was none other than Mr. Robbins.” When the joint\r\nconvention adjourned on March 5 the miners immediately went into\r\nconvention to outline their policy. It did not finish its work until the\r\nafternoon of March 7. A delegation of operators remained in Indianapolis\r\nawaiting the result. Frank Robbins was one of that delegation. He did\r\nnot leave Indianapolis until the evening of March 7 and could not,\r\ntherefore, have been the returning coal operator quoted in the dispatch.\r\n\r\nThat is misstatement No. 4 refuted.\r\n\r\nWe quote further from Mr. Debs, “The national convention had (on March\r\n5) virtually declared for war,” and further on he says: “The convention\r\nvoted to fight and the delegates went home to prepare for hostilities.”\r\nIt had done nothing of the kind. Mr. Debs knows as well as any man that\r\nthe declaring of a strike does not always mean success to the strikers.\r\nHis experience in 1894 is conclusive proof of that fact. A repetition of\r\nthe strike of 1894 would have been as disastrous to the United Mine\r\nWorkers of America as that strike was to the American Railway Union.\r\nMany of the delegates believed that it would be better for the miners to\r\naccept the reduction offered than to take the chances of war, especially\r\nwhen the employers had selected the battle ground, but they were bound\r\nby instructions and could not violate them. When the officials were\r\napproached by these delegates they advised them to obey their\r\ninstructions. To meet this situation the convention on March 5 selected\r\na committee composed of two members from each district to formulate\r\nplans to meet the crisis. The committee reported on March 7 and\r\nrecommended that the ultimatum of the operators be submitted to the\r\nminers affected for their acceptance or rejection, the vote to be taken\r\nbetween the hours of one and six P. M. of March 15, and the mines to be\r\nidle that afternoon in order to give every member an opportunity to vote\r\nwho desired to. The officials supported that proposition and it was\r\nagreed to by the convention. It will thus be seen that there was no\r\nvirtual declaration of war on March 5 and that the convention had not\r\nvoted to fight.\r\n\r\nThat is misstatement No. 5 refuted.\r\n\r\nThese are the alleged truths upon which Mr. Debs builds his flimsy\r\ninsinuations and attempt to destroy the reputation of honest men. We\r\nhave refuted them. Every delegate who attended the convention knows our\r\nstatements are true. There was no secrecy about these actions. If Mr.\r\nDebs had wanted to know the truth, a simple investigation would have\r\nrevealed it to him. It is very evident that he was not seeking for the\r\ntruth. The innuendoes used by Mr. Debs clearly prove this assertion.\r\nHere are some of them:\r\n\r\n“The question is, did Robbins, chief of the operators, have an\r\nunderstanding with Mitchell, president of the miners?”\r\n\r\n“But the delegates, having given up everything, balked at last. Even\r\nMitchell’s ‘masterful effort’ in behalf of the operators fell flat.”\r\n\r\n“As soon as the convention adjourned the leaders of the miners began to\r\nwork upon the rank and file, many of whom are so pitifully ignorant that\r\nthey look upon a union official as a Chinaman does upon his Joss.”\r\n\r\n“Mitchell, the labor leader, and Robbins, the labor exploiter, pooling\r\nissues and joining hands to force down the wages of the mine slaves. Oh,\r\nwhat a transformation!”\r\n\r\nThere is some more along the same line, but that is the gist of it.\r\nNeither Mr. Debs nor any other person ever heard Mr. Mitchell make a\r\n“masterful” or any other kind of an effort in behalf of the operators.\r\nEvery effort he has ever made has been in behalf of the wage workers.\r\nThe miners have something substantial to show for these efforts in\r\ndirecting their organization. Even after the reduction they have\r\naccepted has been taken off they have over seventy per cent higher wages\r\nthan they had in 1897, from two to four hours per day less labor,\r\nimproved conditions in the mines, and the privilege of expressing their\r\nopinion on all social, political and religious questions without fear of\r\ndischarge. We doubt very much if Mr. Debs with all his organizing\r\nability, dynamic energy, prophetic vision and brilliant oratory can show\r\nresults for his labor equivalent to these for the present generation of\r\nmen. If higher wages, shorter hours, healthier and safer conditions of\r\nemployment and greater freedom of speech is the result of “pooling\r\nissues with Robbins, the labor exploiter,” it would seem to be a very\r\nprofitable pool for the wage workers. But Debs knows that no such pool\r\nexists. He knows, or at least ought to know, that these results have\r\nbeen obtained through a strong organization intelligently directed. If\r\nwe were disposed to use the same methods as Mr. Debs we could with\r\nperfect propriety assert that “Proof may be lacking but the\r\ncircumstances combine to make the conclusion almost inevitable” that he\r\nis being paid by the operators to destroy the United Mine Workers in\r\norder that the operators may dominate the miners as they did prior to\r\n1897. We would not be mean enough to even insinuate such a thing. Debs\r\nasserts that many of the miners are so “pitifully ignorant that they\r\nlook upon a union official as a Chinaman does upon his Joss.” He knew\r\nthat statement was wrong when he made it. There are degrees of\r\nintelligence amongst miners as there is amongst all classes of people.\r\nTaken as a whole their intelligence will compare favorably with any\r\nclass of our citizens, rich or poor. They are men that cannot be led\r\nabout by the whims of anybody. Any proposition presented to them for\r\nconsideration must appeal to their intelligence before they will support\r\nit, and they do not hesitate to take issue with a union official\r\nwhenever in their judgment the union official is wrong. Some of them\r\nundoubtedly love and respect their officials, but not one can be found\r\nwho looks upon them as a deity or as a Chinaman looks upon his Joss.\r\n\r\nThe entire expression is an insult to men who are the equals of Mr. Debs\r\nphysically, morally and intellectually. He speaks about the prophecy\r\nmade in his speech at Indianapolis during the Mine Workers’ convention.\r\nWhat was that prophecy? He asserted that we had reached the crest of the\r\nwave of so-called industrial activity, that the turn of the tide was\r\ndownward, and no matter how strong our organization might be, we would\r\nbe compelled to accept reductions in our wages. This prophecy was made\r\nwhile negotiations were pending with the operators and they were still\r\ninsisting upon a reduction of fifteen per cent. If Mr. Mitchell had made\r\na public utterance of that kind at the time Mr. Debs made it, the miners\r\nwould have been compelled to accept a fifteen per cent reduction instead\r\nof a five and one-half per cent. The public can judge for itself who is\r\nthe person that betrayed his trust, whether it was Mr. Debs, who\r\nannounced that the miners must accept a reduction when the operators\r\nwere clamoring for fifteen per cent off, or Mr. Mitchell, who fought the\r\nissue until the last possible penny had been obtained. Mr. Debs\r\napparently assumes that as a friend of the miners it was his duty to\r\ninform them of the perfidy of their officials. What a wonderful\r\nfriendship his must be. The position of Mr. Mitchell and his associates\r\nwas expressed in the miners’ convention of March 5 and was carried by\r\nthe afternoon papers of that date. The dispatch which he quotes was\r\npublished in the morning papers of March 6. On March 7 the mine workers’\r\nconvention decided to submit the acceptance or rejection of the\r\nproposition to the miners themselves, and instructed the national\r\nofficials to send a copy of their recommendation to every local union.\r\nIf Mr. Debs was the friend of the miners that he pretends to be, and if\r\nhe had any proof of dishonesty on the part of the officials, or of\r\ncollusion between them and the operators to reduce the wages of the\r\nminers, he should have furnished them the evidence of it before the vote\r\nwas taken. Mr. Debs had no such proof and we know that it did not exist.\r\n\r\nWhen the bituminous miners of Indiana in convention at Terre Haute,\r\nknowing the facts, passed a resolution condemning the action of Mr.\r\nDebs, he immediately began to whine. In the interview published in the\r\nTerre Haute _Sunday Tribune_, above referred to, he asserts that “Labor\r\nmay always be relied upon to crucify its friends.” What a woeful wail\r\ncoming from the lips of a man who started the cry of “crucify them”\r\nagainst Mr. Mitchell and his associates.\r\n\r\nMuch more might be said in reply to the falsities contained in his\r\narticle, but enough has been told. Whether he is alone in this attack or\r\nis merely carrying out a preconcerted plan to destroy the trade union\r\nmovement we do not know. He may succeed in injuring us personally, but\r\nthe trade union movement is based upon eternal principles of\r\nevolutionary development and he can no more destroy it or divert it from\r\nthe fulfillment of its destiny than he can destroy the waters of the\r\nMississippi with a stone or change its channel with a Chinese chopstick.\r\n\r\n                                                          JOHN MITCHELL.\r\n                                                          T. L. LEWIS.\r\n                                                          W. B. WILSON.\r\n\r\nThis was followed by the reply of Mr. Debs in the issue of the _Social\r\nDemocratic Herald_ of June 4 and republished in the issue of June 25, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n                                        MR. DEBS.\r\n\r\n                                        Terre Haute, Ind., May 28, 1904.\r\n\r\n _To the S. D. Herald_:\r\n\r\nThe brief article I had in the _Herald_ of April 9 in reference to the\r\nwage reduction forced upon the coal miners by the mine owners, assisted\r\nby the national officers of the United Mine Workers, has not been\r\nignored as Mr. Mitchell said it would be when it was first brought to\r\nhis attention. It required Mr. Mitchell to summon the aid of his\r\ncolleagues, six weeks of time and several columns of space to point out\r\nthe “misstatements,” and so hopeless did they find the task that they\r\nhad to confess failure in vulgar resort to personal detraction.\r\n\r\nThe alleged reply consists wholly of words. From first to last it is a\r\nquibble over minor points. Every material fact is evaded; every\r\nirrelevant detail is brought out and made to do duty in the circular\r\nprocession.\r\n\r\nThe essential truth of my statement has not and will not be denied. It\r\ncannot be answered by personal abuse, nor extinguished by a deluge of\r\nmeaningless words.\r\n\r\nSuppose I were foolish enough to pose as a “martyr,” what has that to do\r\nwith the case? Does it alter the fact that Mr. Mitchell, Mr. Wilson and\r\nMr. Lewis used all the power of their official positions to help the\r\noperators reduce the wages of the miners, and this after Mr. Mitchell\r\nhad proved conclusively that the reduction was “unwarranted” and after\r\nhe had declared he would never consent to it?\r\n\r\nNever mind about the “diseased imagination,” the “crucified martyr,” and\r\nthe particular hour of adjournment. Is the above statement true or is it\r\nfalse?\r\n\r\nMr. Mitchell virtually admits it and his explanation places him in the\r\nattitude of a general on a field of battle, first assuring his soldiers\r\nthat their cause is just and that they must face the enemy like men, and\r\nthen, on the eve of the fight, turning about and saying to the same\r\nsoldiers who had so lustily cheered him: “I have been in conference with\r\nthe general on the other side and he has convinced me that we are taking\r\ndesperate chances of being whipped, and so I advise that you accept the\r\nterms of the enemy and retreat from the field without a fight.”\r\n\r\nAs to the personal insinuations which are supposed to serve where\r\nargument fails, I regret as much as Mr. Mitchell seems to enjoy the\r\nmeagerness of my service to the working class, but little as that\r\nservice may amount to, I have the satisfaction of knowing that it is not\r\nof a quality to inspire the capitalist press to convince me that I am\r\nthe greatest labor leader on earth.\r\n\r\nAnd little as I may claim, as compared with Mr. Mitchell, there is yet\r\nenough to include an almost fatal sunstroke, sustained on a public\r\nhighway, the only place allowed me under a federal injunction, while\r\nrallying a body of coal miners to unite in the fight for an increase of\r\nwages and join the United Mine Workers of America.\r\n\r\nMr. Mitchell claims that I accused him of dishonesty. I deny it. No such\r\ncharge was made by me. I am concerned with acts and facts and not with\r\nmotives. Mr. Mitchell’s honesty is not in question. Let that be\r\nconceded. Results remain the same.\r\n\r\nNow what are the questions in controversy?\r\n\r\nFirst—In my article of April 9 I incorporated a press dispatch sent out\r\nby the Pittsburg _Post_ on March 6, saying that it, the _Post_, had it\r\nupon the “best authority” that there would be no strike, that the miners\r\nwould accept the reduction, and that a two years’ contract would be\r\nsigned.\r\n\r\nThe dispatch was sent out after the convention of miners at Indianapolis\r\nhad turned down the ultimatum of the operators, and a strike seemed so\r\nimminent that the press uniformly declared that “only a miracle could\r\nprevent it.”\r\n\r\nThe prediction made in the dispatch came true to the letter. There was\r\nno strike, the reduction was accepted and the contract was made for two\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThe dispatch was undoubtedly sent out on the “best authority.” It was\r\ntrue prophecy. Now, the question is, Who is the “best authority” as to\r\nwhether the miners will strike or not? Did the _Post_ speak upon such\r\nauthority? The outcome verifies it. Again, did the _Post_ have such\r\nauthority, or did it lie? The _Post_ is friendly to Mr. Mitchell; will\r\nhe say it lied? Will he have the _Post_ name its “best authority”?\r\n\r\nI inferred that the _Post’s_ “best authority” was Mr. F. L. Robbins,\r\nleader of the mine owners, who lives in Pittsburg, where the _Post_ is\r\npublished, and I then asked, “Did Robbins, leader of the operators, have\r\nan understanding with Mitchell, president of the miners,” and I\r\nanswered, “It must be admitted that it looks that way.”\r\n\r\nThis is the point that excites the wrath of the union officials. I now\r\nrepeat it. To me it looks that way. I cannot avoid that conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe only error I made was in the date of adjournment. The convention\r\nadjourned March 7, not the 5th. Upon this point I stand corrected, but\r\nit is wholly immaterial. The convention refused the ultimatum of the\r\noperators on the 5th, the press reports saying “the vote was cast in the\r\nface of the opposition of President Mitchell and the other national\r\nofficers.” Next day the _Post_ sent out its prophetic dispatch. That is\r\nthe point at issue, the action of the convention and the _Post’s_\r\nprophetic announcement next day. The date of adjournment does not alter\r\nthe fact in the smallest degree.\r\n\r\n“But,” says Mr. Mitchell, “Mr. Robbins had not returned to Pittsburg and\r\ntherefore could not have given the _Post_ the information—that disposes\r\nof the ‘misstatement.’” Not quite. The _Post_ had a representative at\r\nIndianapolis and there are telegraph wires between there and Pittsburg.\r\n\r\nWhen I said that in my opinion there was an “understanding” between\r\nRobbins and Mitchell I simply meant what I said. The men are on friendly\r\npersonal terms. There is nothing wrong about that. When “they shook\r\nhands in the presence of the delegates and engaged in earnest\r\nconversation and were loudly applauded by the convention” there was no\r\nobjection to that.\r\n\r\nBut the miners voted down the operators in spite of Mitchell’s protest.\r\nThat is a fact, is it not?\r\n\r\nAnd when the operators were voted down Mitchell and the national\r\nofficers of the union appealed to the referendum.\r\n\r\nWould they have resorted to the referendum if the delegates had voted to\r\naccept instead of rejecting the reduction?\r\n\r\nThe national officers also had themselves authorized by the delegates to\r\n“explain the situation” to the local unions in sending out the vote, and\r\nthis “explanation” took every form that could be devised to whip the\r\nrank and file into submission to the operators.\r\n\r\nAs an instance of this “explanation” the speech of Mr. Lewis at Linton\r\nwas a shining success. He was given full credit by the capitalist press\r\nfor having turned defeat into victory and carrying the day for the\r\nreduction and against the strike.\r\n\r\nBut to complete the evidence. When the operators were turned down by the\r\nminers’ convention and a strike seemed inevitable, the Pittsburg _Post_\r\ncoolly declared that it had it upon the “best authority” that there\r\nwould be no strike, that the miners would give in; and then it went on\r\nto state precisely what the basis of final settlement would be and that\r\nthe contract would be signed for two years. Less than two weeks later\r\nall these things came to pass to the very letter.\r\n\r\nNow this “best authority” was doubtless Robbins speaking through the\r\n“returning operators” mentioned in the dispatch, who knew that the\r\nmatter would go to the local unions, and had the assurance that Mitchell\r\nand the national officers would use all their influence in favor of the\r\nreduction and that with the national officers on their side the\r\nreferendum vote would defeat the strike and enforce the reduction.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the operators felt certain that the union officials\r\ncould and would swing the vote of the organization and the prophecy that\r\nwas fulfilled was made accordingly.\r\n\r\nBut even if Mr. Mitchell gave the operators no single word of assurance,\r\nhis actions and utterances were sufficient and the fact remains\r\nunchanged. They knew his position and counted on his influence, and he\r\ndid not disappoint them.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this more than 67,000 members of his organization,\r\nrepresenting its highest intelligence, voted against the reduction,\r\nrejecting his advice and impeaching his leadership, and I happen to know\r\nthat a large proportion of them heartily approve and are ready to stand\r\nby every statement contained in my article.\r\n\r\nHere are a few lines just received from a member of the Miners’ Union:\r\n“I want to thank you for telling the truth about the settlement. The\r\noperators beat us with the help of our own officers. Six months ago a\r\nman would have been mobbed if he had said a word about Mitchell in this\r\nneighborhood. Now you can hear him condemned everywhere. You have more\r\nfriends among the miners here today than John Mitchell.”\r\n\r\nThe four alleged “misstatements” Mr. Mitchell claims to have disposed of\r\nin his attempted denial are in fact one and the same, and hinge upon the\r\nsimple error in the date of adjournment, which, as I have shown, is\r\nutterly inconsequential and has no bearing whatever upon the material\r\nfacts of the statement which stand as wholly unimpeached as when they\r\nwere first written down.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, here is substantially what I stated: That Mr. Mitchell led\r\nthe miners in their conference with the operators; that he said: “This\r\nyear the demands of the miners referring to the absolute run of mine\r\nbasis and the present wage scale must be met or the mines will cease to\r\nproduce coal,” that he demanded a uniform wage for all inside and\r\noutside labor and a 7-cent differential; that he advised his followers\r\nto stand firm; that he declared he would never yield; that the United\r\nMine Workers would take no backward step; that the reduction proposed by\r\nthe operators was unwarranted and would not be accepted; that last\r\nyear’s earnings of the Pittsburg Coal Co. were $20,000,000, showing a\r\nlarge increase in profits; that he and the miners were “terribly in\r\nearnest,” etc., etc.\r\n\r\nI have the reports before me and the proof that this was his attitude\r\nand these his utterances is simply overwhelming.\r\n\r\nWhat next? Why, a few days later, we hear him saying to his followers:\r\n“Your national officers want you to accept this cut.”\r\n\r\nWhat do you think of it, Mr. Mitchell?\r\n\r\nWould it be possible for an enemy to place you in a more unfavorable\r\nlight than you are placed by your own official words and acts?\r\n\r\nYou said all these things and did not mean them. You yielded one point\r\nand then another, after declaring you would not yield; finally when you\r\nhad surrendered all your demands you declared that you would insist upon\r\nthe old scale, and that you _would not recede_ from it. But you _did\r\nrecede_ from it. You not only yielded everything you originally demanded\r\nbut you agreed to a reduction. Not only this, but _you did all in your\r\nofficial power to enforce that reduction_.\r\n\r\nAre these facts or are they falsehoods, and if they are facts they\r\naccord perfectly with your capitalistic philosophy that “there is no\r\nnecessary conflict between capital and labor.” It is only necessary for\r\nlabor to have leaders with the civic federation label upon them and\r\npeacefully submit to slavery and degradation.\r\n\r\nWhat right has Mr. Mitchell to talk about the capitalist press as the\r\n“paid agents of capital”? Is it not the capitalist press that has poured\r\nout its fulsome eulogy upon Mr. Mitchell and heralded him as the\r\ngreatest leader of labor in all history?\r\n\r\nIt is my right, Mr. Mitchell, to arraign that press as the enemy of\r\nlabor, but not your right, for you are a prime favorite with that press\r\nand the class who own that press, and when you denounce it you are\r\nguilty of ingratitude to the power that largely made you what you are.\r\n\r\nIs it a sure sign that I am trying to destroy the Miners’ Union because\r\nI am opposed to the reduction of the miners’ wages? Is this the best\r\nspecimen of pure and simple labor union logic these gentlemen have to\r\noffer?\r\n\r\nWhat I am really trying to destroy is the mine owners’ influence in the\r\nMine Workers’ Union. To that I plead guilty and there I draw the line.\r\nThe operators know it and hate me accordingly. The mine workers, most of\r\nthem, do not, as yet, know it and they share the hatred of their\r\nmasters. But I can wait.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the district convention of miners, held here, denounced\r\nme; it is also true that I said in reference to such action that “labor\r\nmay generally be relied upon to crucify its friends.” This Mr. Mitchell\r\nis pleased to call a “whine.” These words were used to characterize the\r\naction of the men who said, “We have got to denounce Debs to set\r\nourselves right with the operators.” They understood me and this is\r\nsufficient. And mark me, Mr. Mitchell, and don’t forget it, that body of\r\nminers, or their successors, will rescind those resolutions, and when\r\nthey are finally directed where they properly belong you may have less\r\noccasion than you fancy you now have, even with the operators on your\r\nside, for self-congratulation.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime I have no resentment but entire sympathy for those who\r\ndenounced me. They acted for their masters and simply emphasized their\r\nown wage slavery.\r\n\r\nMine Owner Robbins was wise when he said to the miners’ delegates: “The\r\nunion between the operators and miners has been a partnership for\r\nseveral years that I have been proud of.”\r\n\r\nThere is a whole volume in that paragraph.\r\n\r\nAnd there is another in the utterance of Vice President T. L. Lewis of\r\nthe United Mine Workers when the strike seemed certain: “If Senator\r\nHanna had lived there would have been no strike. His influence would\r\nhave been powerful enough to force the operators to listen to reason.”\r\n\r\nWhat a commentary upon the United Mine Workers and its leaders!\r\n\r\nOperator Robbins and labor leader Mitchell and his colleagues, Governor\r\nPeabody and President Gompers, David Parry and Sherman Bell all belong\r\nto the same capitalist political party that supports the same capitalist\r\nadministration that assassinates eight-hour and anti-injunction bills\r\nand treats labor like a galley slave.\r\n\r\nTo me it seems not only like sarcasm but positively tragic to hear Mr.\r\nMitchell and his colleagues boast of the “great benefits” that have come\r\nto the miners and the “substantial” things they are now enjoying in face\r\nof the fact that thousands of them are totally idle, that those employed\r\nin the coal fields of Indiana today do not average above two days of\r\nwork a week, that they are in debt, housed in shacks and eke out a\r\nmiserable existence as the coal digging victims of wage slavery.\r\n\r\nThese miners get 85 cents for digging a ton of coal for which the people\r\nin that immediate vicinity pay $3.50. The operators, of course, get\r\nrich; the miners, of course, stay poor. Truly, an ideal arrangement.\r\n\r\nSmall wonder that the “interstate movement” perfectly suits the\r\noperators, that the United Mine Workers under the leadership of\r\nMitchell, Wilson and Lewis is so satisfactory to them that they agree to\r\ncollect its dues by deducting them from the wages of the miners, without\r\nwhich the union would go to pieces; and this is one of the reasons why\r\nMr. Mitchell did not dare to break with Mr. Robbins, and why Mr.\r\nMitchell helped Mr. Robbins to force the wage reduction upon the miners.\r\n\r\nMr. Mitchell has profound regard for the good will of the capitalist and\r\ngreat consideration for his feelings, interests and general importance,\r\nso great that he issues a proclamation to the miners of the country\r\ncalling upon them to refrain from work while a capitalist is being\r\nburied, with not the remotest thought of showing such extreme respect to\r\nthe memory of the dead when instead of a rich capitalist it is only a\r\nhundred and eighty poor coal diggers, stark and mutilated, blown up in a\r\nmine through the criminal negligence of the capitalist owners for whom\r\nthey were digging up profits.\r\n\r\nMr. Mitchell sees “no necessary conflict between labor and capital.”\r\nThen why the United Mine Workers? What excuse has it to exist? Its whole\r\nrecord is one of conflict, honorable conflict, waged under difficulties\r\nand involving hunger, rags and death, and every page of it tells in\r\nharrowing phrase of the necessary conflict between the capitalist and\r\nthe wage worker, the exploiter and his victim, the master and his slave.\r\n\r\nIf there is no “necessary” conflict, why any at all? Why do not the\r\noperators raise wages instead of lowering them? What have the miners\r\nbeen striking for all these years? Is it not because they have had to\r\nfight tooth and nail for every particle they have ever received? Has all\r\nthis been unnecessary? Does Mr. Mitchell draw salary as president of the\r\nMine Workers to continue this “unnecessary” conflict, or to put an end\r\nto it by letting the operators control his union and advising the miners\r\nto thankfully accept what the operators see fit to allow them?\r\n\r\nIt is doubtless because he sees no “necessary” conflict between capital\r\nand labor that Mr. Mitchell is a Republican in politics. He also claims\r\nto be a friend of President Roosevelt—and so is Sherman Bell.\r\n\r\nMr. Mitchell’s friend Roosevelt hasn’t the power as chief executive and\r\ncommander-in-chief of the nation to prevent the snuffing out of a state\r\nconstitution, the brutal banishment of Mother Jones, the burial alive of\r\nthat real labor leader, C. H. Moyer, and the murder and mobbing of\r\nminers in Colorado by the military criminals in authority.\r\n\r\nGrover Cleveland served the capitalists by invading the state of\r\nIllinois and Theodore Roosevelt serves them just as loyally by keeping\r\nout of Colorado.\r\n\r\nPresident Roosevelt may be your friend, Mr. Mitchell, but he is not the\r\nfriend of the exploited class you are supposed to stand for. He is not\r\nmy friend, nor do he and I belong to the same party, or stand for the\r\nsame principles.\r\n\r\nMr. Mitchell says “there is no necessary conflict between capital and\r\nlabor.” I say there is no possible peace between them. Every hour of\r\ntruce is at the price of slavery. This is Mr. Mitchell’s fundamental\r\nerror. From this all others spring and he has yet to face their\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I have not the slightest feeling about the matter. There was\r\na time when I admired and applauded Mitchell’s leadership. I thought I\r\nsaw the coming of a man. But alas! Little by little I have seen him\r\nsuccumb to the blandishments of the plutocrats. He is today their beau\r\nideal as a labor leader.\r\n\r\nThe man was never born who can honestly serve both capitalist and wage\r\nworker, both master and slave.\r\n\r\nTime will tell!\r\n\r\nThere is a mass of evidence and other matter I have had to omit. Space\r\nwill not allow its use and I have already exceeded proper bounds. I have\r\na proposition:\r\n\r\nMessrs. Mitchell, Wilson and Lewis allude to themselves as “men who are\r\nthe equals of Mr. Debs physically, morally and intellectually.” Good!\r\nNow, then, I want the truth and shall assume that these gentlemen want\r\nthe same. There is not space in a paper for full discussion of this\r\nquestion, nor is such discussion satisfactory or final. I aver that the\r\nessential facts set forth in my article in the _Herald_ of April 9 are\r\ntrue and can be maintained by overwhelming proof. Mr. Mitchell says\r\nthere is scarcely a truthful statement in the entire article. He also\r\nsays “there is no necessary conflict between capital and labor.” I\r\nchallenge Mr. Mitchell to meet me upon these issues before the members\r\nof his own organization, the miners of Illinois, his own state, and of\r\nSpring Valley, the city in which he lives. Mr. Mitchell may have both\r\nMr. Wilson and Mr. Lewis to help him.\r\n\r\nLet the case be presented to the miners whose union I am charged with\r\nattempting to destroy and let them render the verdict.\r\n\r\n                                                         EUGENE V. DEBS.\r\n\r\nSupplementary to the above the following and final letter of Mr. Debs\r\nappeared in the same paper July 2, 1904:\r\n\r\n                                       MR. DEBS.\r\n\r\n                                       Terre Haute, Ind., June 24, 1904.\r\n\r\n _To the S. D. Herald_:\r\n\r\nSome time ago I said that John Mitchell, president of the United Mine\r\nWorkers, and Francis L. Robbins, president of the Pittsburg Coal\r\nCompany, understood each other perfectly in reference to the settlement\r\nof the threatened coal strike which reduced the miners’ wages; and that\r\nMr. Robbins and the operators had the assistance of Mr. Mitchell in\r\nenforcing the reduction and were able to predict it with accuracy long\r\nbefore it was finally agreed to by the rank and file of the miners. Mr.\r\nMitchell denied this over his signature and Mr. Robbins, according to\r\nthe Pittsburg _Labor World_, said it was a “contemptible lie.”\r\n\r\nThe Pittsburg _Dispatch_ of June 7 has an extended account of an\r\nincident that may not be corroborative but it is certainly significant,\r\nand, like the proverbial straw, shows which way the wind blows.\r\n\r\nMr. Mitchell has gone to Europe and it is not my purpose to attack him\r\nin his absence but simply to put this incident on record for future\r\nreference.\r\n\r\nThe article in question is headed with a five-column cut of an elaborate\r\nbanquet scene, the guests consisting of mine owners, mine workers and\r\ncapitalist politicians. At the table of honor are Mr. Mitchell and Mr.\r\nRobbins, with Patrick Dolan, district president, between them as the\r\ncentral figure and toastmaster of the evening.\r\n\r\nMr. Dolan’s boast is that he has never read a book on economics and he\r\nproves it daily in his works. In a recent action for libel brought\r\nagainst a local paper by a couple of organizers for the Socialist Labor\r\nParty, Mr. Dolan testified for the defendant. In answer to a question he\r\nsaid that Socialism and anarchy were one and the same thing. Asked how\r\nthat was he said: “They are both against the flag.” If the rearmost\r\nstraggler in the rank and file were as far advanced as Mr. Dolan, his\r\nleader, the darkness would be complete and the cause of labor all but\r\nhopeless.\r\n\r\nSuch a leader is conclusive evidence that there are vast stretches\r\nbetween his followers and daylight.\r\n\r\nWhat Mr. Dolan does not know about labor makes him hate Socialism and\r\nfits him to preside at a banquet where workers are used as dummies to\r\nrenew allegiance to the reign of their masters.\r\n\r\nThe _Dispatch_ article has the following double-column headlines:\r\n\r\n“MINERS START A BOOM FOR COMBINE LEADER”—“F. L. ROBBINS APPROVED FOR\r\nUNITED STATES SENATOR AT DINNER IN HONOR OF LABOR OFFICIALS”—“THEIR\r\nGRACEFUL COMPLIMENT.”\r\n\r\nThe account in part follows:\r\n\r\n“In the presence of the recipient of the honor, coal operators and\r\norganized coal miners of western Pennsylvania formally proposed Francis\r\nL. Robbins, president of the Pittsburg Coal Company, for the United\r\nStates senate at a banquet last night at the Henry Hotel. The banquet\r\nwas in honor of John Mitchell, president of the United Mine Workers, and\r\nDistrict Secretary William Dodds to wish the two godspeed on a European\r\ntour they are about to make in the interest of their organization. Even\r\nMitchell joined in the tribute to Robbins, which was taken up by\r\nothers.”\r\n\r\n“Although hailed as the next senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Robbins\r\nconfined his remarks to an eulogy of Mitchell and Dodds.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Mitchell and Dodds were presented with diamond mementoes of the esteem\r\nof the operators and miners.”\r\n\r\n“Secretary Dodds started the Robbins movement. Dodds is secretary of a\r\ndistrict of 37,000 organized miners. He formally proposed Mr. Robbins\r\nfor United States senator. The coal president was cheered for several\r\nminutes. He said he attended the banquet to do honor to two friends.”\r\n\r\n“The presence of operators and miners,” said Mr. Robbins, “defines the\r\nproper relation between capital and labor, employer and employed. One\r\nthing has led up to the present state of affairs: _Miners recognize that\r\nconservative men must be placed at the head of their organization_.” * *\r\n*\r\n\r\n“If the future shows a change it will be because labor does not continue\r\nto put conservative men at the head of their organization.”\r\n\r\n“THE ONLY MENACE TO ORGANIZED LABOR NOW IS SOCIALISM, AND SOCIALISM MUST\r\nBE RELEGATED TO THE REAR.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Mitchell then spoke and among other things is reported as saying\r\nthat:\r\n\r\n“He believes harmonious relations between organized capital and\r\norganized labor can be obtained without labor surrendering any of its\r\nrights or capitalism surrendering its rights.”\r\n\r\nThe foregoing appeals strongly for comment, especially the statement of\r\nMr. Robbins, coal baron and labor leader, that Socialism is a menace to\r\norganized labor, but I will only say that Mr. Robbins knows quite well\r\nthat Socialism is a menace only to the class suggested by his name and\r\nthat this prompts him to assail it while he places diamond decorations\r\nupon the “conservative” leaders of his coal-digging wage-slaves.\r\n\r\nThe fact that Mr. John Mitchell, labor leader, sees nothing wrong in\r\naccepting a diamond badge from the rich and designing exploiters of his\r\npoor and pilfered followers; that he evidently has not the least\r\nconception of what such a testimonial really symbolizes, may serve\r\nsufficiently in mitigation to shield him from merited contempt and\r\ncondemnation.\r\n\r\n                                                         EUGENE V. DEBS.\r\n\r\nThe editions of the _Herald_ containing the letters were speedily\r\nexhausted, and as there seemed to be an increasing interest in the\r\ncontroversy it was finally concluded to publish the correspondence in\r\npamphlet form to supply the great demand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CELL OCCUPIED BY DEBS IN WOODSTOCK JAIL\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n             The Federal Government and the Chicago Strike\r\n\r\n _Reply to the article on “The Government in the Chicago Strike of 1894”\r\n in McClure’s Magazine, July, 1904, by Grover Cleveland, ex-President of\r\n                                the U. S._\r\n\r\n _Written for and rejected by McClure’s Magazine. Published by Appeal to\r\n                        Reason, August 27, 1904._\r\n\r\nIn the July issue of _McClure’s Magazine_ ex-President Grover Cleveland\r\nhas an article on “The Government in the Chicago Strike of 1894.” That\r\nthere may be no mistake about the meaning of “government” in this\r\nconnection it should be understood that Mr. Cleveland has reference to\r\nthe Federal government, of which he was the executive head at the time\r\nof the strike in question, and not to the State government of Illinois,\r\nor the municipal government of Chicago, both of which were overridden\r\nand set at defiance by the executive authority, enforced by the military\r\npower of the Federal government under the administration of Mr.\r\nCleveland.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     CLEVELAND VINDICATES HIMSELF.\r\n\r\nThe ex-President’s article not only triumphantly vindicates his\r\nadministration but congratulates its author upon the eminent service he\r\nrendered the republic in a critical hour when a labor strike jarred its\r\nfoundations and threatened its overthrow.\r\n\r\nIt may be sheer coincidence that Mr. Cleveland’s eulogy upon his\r\npatriotic administration and upon himself as its central and commanding\r\nfigure appears on the eve of a national convention composed largely of\r\nhis disciples, who are urging his fourth nomination for the presidency\r\nfor the very reasons set forth in the article on the Chicago strike.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, it is certain that of his own knowledge\r\nex-President Cleveland knows nothing of the strike he discusses; that\r\nthe evidence upon which he acted officially and upon which he now bases\r\nhis conclusion was _ex parte_, obtained wholly from the railroad\r\ninterests and those who represented or were controlled by these\r\ninterests, and it is not strange, therefore, that he falls into a series\r\nof errors beginning with the cause of the disturbance and running all\r\nthrough his account of it, as may be proved beyond doubt by reference to\r\nthe “Report on the Chicago Strike” by the “United States Strike\r\nCommission” of his own appointment.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      WHAT WAS THE CHICAGO STRIKE?\r\n\r\nSimply one of the many battles that have been fought and are yet to be\r\nfought in the economic war between capital and labor. Pittsburg,\r\nHomestead, Buffalo, Latimer, Pana, Cœur d’Alene, Cripple Creek and\r\nTelluride recall a few of the battles fought in this country in the\r\nworld-wide struggle for industrial emancipation.\r\n\r\nWhen the strike at Chicago occurred did President Cleveland make a\r\npersonal examination? No.\r\n\r\nDid he grant both sides a hearing? He did not.\r\n\r\nIn his fourteen-page magazine article what workingman, or what\r\nrepresentative of labor, does he cite in support of his statements or\r\nhis official acts? Not one.\r\n\r\nI aver that he received every particle of his information from the\r\ncapitalist side, that he was prompted to act by the capitalist side,\r\nthat his official course was determined wholly, absolutely, by and in\r\nthe interest of the capitalist side, and that no more thought or\r\nconsideration was given to the other side—the hundreds of thousands of\r\nworkingmen whose lives and whose wives and babes were at stake—than if\r\nthey had been so many swine or sheep that had balked on their way to the\r\nshambles.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  THE OBJECT OF FEDERAL INTERFERENCE.\r\n\r\nFrom the Federal judge who sat on the bench as the protege of the late\r\nGeorge M. Pullman, to whose influence he was indebted for his\r\nappointment—as he was to the railroad companies for the annual passes he\r\nhad in his pocket—down to the last thug sworn in by the railroads and\r\npaid by the railroads (p. 340 report of Strike Commission) to serve the\r\nrailroads as United States deputy marshal, the one object of the Federal\r\nCourt and its officers was, not the enforcement of law and preservation\r\nof order, but the breaking up of the strike in the interest of the\r\nrailroad corporations, and it was because of this fact that John P.\r\nAltgeld, Governor of Illinois, and John P. Hopkins, Mayor of Chicago,\r\nwere not in harmony with President Cleveland’s administration and\r\nprotested against the Federal troops being used in their state and city\r\nfor such a malign purpose.\r\n\r\nThis is the fact and I shall prove it beyond doubt before this article\r\nis concluded.\r\n\r\n\r\n               CLEVELAND OMITS REFERENCE TO JUDGE WOODS.\r\n\r\nThe late Judge William A. Woods figured as one of the principal judges\r\nin the Chicago affair, issuing the injunctions, citing the strikers to\r\nappear before him and sentencing them to jail without trial, but\r\nPresident Cleveland discreetly omits all reference to him; and although\r\nhe introduces copies of many documents, his article does not include\r\ncopies of the telegrams that passed between Judge Woods from his home at\r\nIndianapolis and the railroad managers at Chicago before he left home to\r\nhold court in the latter city.\r\n\r\nJudge Woods had the distinction of convicting the writer and his\r\ncolleagues without a trial and of releasing William W. Dudley of “Blocks\r\nof Five” memory in spite of a trial.\r\n\r\nJudge Woods is dead and I do not attack the dead. I have to mention his\r\nname, and this of itself is sufficient.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      PULLMAN’S CONTEMPT OF COURT.\r\n\r\nDuring the strike the late George M. Pullman was summoned to appear\r\nbefore the Federal Court to give testimony. He at once had his private\r\ncar attached to an eastbound train and left the city, treating the court\r\nwith sovereign contempt. On his return, accompanied by Robert Todd\r\nLincoln, his attorney, he had a tete-a-tete with the court, “in\r\nchambers,” and that ended the matter. He was not required to testify,\r\nnor to appear in open court. The striker upon whom there fell even the\r\nsuspicion of a shadow of contempt was sentenced and jailed with\r\nalacrity. Not one was spared, not one invited to a “heart-to-heart” with\r\nhis honor, “in chambers.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                       A CHALLENGE TO CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the article of ex-President Cleveland I wish to adduce the\r\nproof of my exceptions and denials, as well as the evidence to support\r\nmy affirmations, but I realize that in the limited space of a single\r\nissue it is impossible to do this in complete and satisfactory manner;\r\nand as the case is important enough to be revived, after a lapse of ten\r\nyears, by Mr. Cleveland, and as the side of labor has never yet reached\r\nthe people, I am prompted to suggest a fair and full hearing of both\r\nsides on the public rostrum or in a series of articles, and I shall be\r\nhappy to meet Mr. Cleveland or any one he may designate in such oral or\r\nwritten discussion, and if I fail to relieve the great body of railroad\r\nmen who composed the American Railway Union of the criminal stigma which\r\nMr. Cleveland has sought to fasten upon them, or if I cannot produce\r\nsatisfactory evidence that the crimes charged were instigated by the\r\nother side—the side in whose interest President Cleveland brought to\r\nbear all the powers of the Federal government—I will agree to publicly\r\nbeg forgiveness of the railroads, apologize to the ex-President and\r\ncease my agitation forever.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE CAUSE OF THE PULLMAN STRIKE.\r\n\r\nIt is easy for Mr. Cleveland and others who were on the side of the\r\nrailroads to introduce copies of documents, reports, etc., for the\r\nsimple reason that the Federal Court at Chicago compelled the telegraph\r\ncompanies to deliver up copies of all our telegrams and copies of the\r\nproceedings of the convention and other meetings of the American Railway\r\nUnion, including secret sessions, but the Federal Court did not call\r\nupon the railroads to produce the telegrams that passed among\r\nthemselves, nor between their counsel and the Federal authorities, nor\r\nthe printed proceedings of the General Managers’ Association for public\r\ninspection and as a basis for criminal prosecution.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          HAD THE STRIKE WON.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, there is available proof sufficient to make it clear to\r\nthe unprejudiced mind, to the honest man who seeks the truth, that the\r\nUnited States government, under the administration of President Grover\r\nCleveland, was at the beck and call of the railroad corporations, acting\r\nas one through the “General Managers’ Association,” and that these\r\ncorporations, with the Federal Courts and troops to back them up, had\r\nswarms of mercenaries sworn in as deputy marshals to incite violence as\r\na pretext for taking possession of the headquarters of the American\r\nRailway Union by armed force, throwing its leaders into prison without\r\ntrial and breaking down the union that was victorious, maligning,\r\nbrow-beating and persecuting its peaceable and law-abiding members and\r\nputting the railroad corporations in supreme control of the situation.\r\n\r\nThat was the part of President Cleveland in the Chicago strike, and for\r\nthis achievement the railroad combine and the trusts in general remember\r\nhim with profound gratitude, and are not only willing but anxious that\r\nhe shall be President of the United States forevermore.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     A PRECEDENT FOR FUTURE ACTION.\r\n\r\nIn the closing paragraph of his article Mr. Cleveland compliments his\r\nadministration upon having cleared the way “which shall hereafter guide\r\nour nation safely and surely in the exercise of its functions which\r\nrepresent the people’s trust.” The word “people’s” is not only\r\nsuperfluous but mischievous and fatal to the truth. Omit that and the\r\nex-President’s statement will not be challenged.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        CLEVELAND’S FIRST MOVE.\r\n\r\nHow did President Cleveland begin operations in the Chicago strike.\r\nAmong the first things he did, as he himself tells us, was to appoint\r\nEdwin Walker as special counsel for the government.\r\n\r\nWho was Edwin Walker?\r\n\r\n“An able and prominent attorney,” says Mr. Cleveland.\r\n\r\nIs that all?\r\n\r\nNot quite. At the time President Cleveland and his Attorney-General,\r\nRichard Olney, designated Edwin Walker, upon recommendation of the\r\nrailroads, as special counsel to the government, for which alleged\r\nservice he was paid a fee that amounted to a fortune, _the said Edwin\r\nWalker was already the counsel for the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul\r\nRailway._\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CORRIDOR IN WOODSTOCK JAIL WHERE DEBS EXERCISED\r\n]\r\n\r\nTurning for a moment to “Who’s Who In America,” we find:\r\n\r\n“Walker, Edwin, lawyer, * * * removed to Chicago in 1865; has\r\nrepresented several railroads as general solicitor since 1860. Illinois\r\ncounsel for C., M. & St. P. R. R. since 1870; also partner in firm of W.\r\nP. Rend & Co., coal miners and shippers. Was counsel for the railway\r\ncompanies and special counsel for the United States in the lawsuits\r\ngrowing out of the great railroad strike of 1894.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                  THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE APPOINTMENT.\r\n\r\nHere is the situation: There is a conflict between the General Managers’\r\nAssociation, representing the railroads, and the American Railway Union,\r\nrepresenting the employes. Perfect quiet and order prevail, as I shall\r\nshow, but the railroads are beaten to a standstill, utterly helpless,\r\ncannot even move a mail car, simply because their employes have quit\r\ntheir service and left the premises in a body. Note also that the\r\nemployes were willing to haul the mail trains and all other trains,\r\nrefusing only to handle Pullman cars until the Pullman Company should\r\nconsent to arbitrate its disagreement with its striking and starving\r\nemployes. But the railroad officials determined that if the Pullman cars\r\nwere not handled the mail cars should not move.\r\n\r\nThis is how and why the mails were obstructed and this was the pretext\r\nfor Federal interference. In a word, President Cleveland, obedient to\r\nthe railroads, took sides with them and supported them in their conflict\r\nwith their employes with all the powers of the Federal government.\r\n\r\n\r\n                STRIKE COMMISSION REPORT VS. CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\nTo bear out these facts it is not necessary to go outside of the\r\nofficial report of the Strike Commission, which anyone may verify at his\r\npleasure. The only reason I do not incorporate the voluminous evidence\r\nis that the space at my command must be economized for other purposes.\r\n\r\nIt is thus made clear that President Cleveland and his Cabinet placed\r\nthe government at the service of the railroads.\r\n\r\nEdwin Walker, their own attorney, made the agent of the government and\r\nput in supreme command of the railroad and government forces! What an\r\nunholy alliance! And what a spectacle and object lesson!\r\n\r\nUpon Walker’s representations Cleveland acted; upon Walker’s demand, the\r\nFederal soldiers marched into Chicago; upon Walker’s command, the great\r\ngovernment of the United States obeyed with all the subserviency of a\r\ntrained lackey.\r\n\r\n\r\n                SUPPOSE CLEVELAND HAD APPOINTED DARROW?\r\n\r\nSuppose that President Cleveland had appointed Clarence S. Darrow,\r\nattorney for the American Railway Union, instead of Edwin Walker,\r\nattorney of the General Managers’ Association, as special counsel for\r\nthe government!\r\n\r\nAnd suppose that Darrow had ordered the offices of the General Managers’\r\nAssociation sacked, the books, papers and correspondence, including the\r\nunopened private letters of the absent officers, packed up and carted\r\naway and the offices put under the guard of Federal ruffians, in\r\nflagrant violation of the Constitution of the United States, as was done\r\nby order of Walker with the offices of the American Railway Union!\r\n\r\nAnd suppose, moreover, that the American Railway Union, backed up by\r\nDarrow, agent of the United States government, had sworn in an army of\r\n“thugs, thieves and ex-convicts” (see official report of Michael\r\nBrennan, superintendent of Chicago police to the Council of Chicago) to\r\nserve the American Railway Union as deputy United States marshals and\r\n“conservators of peace and order!”\r\n\r\nAnd suppose, finally, that the expected trouble had followed, would\r\nanyone in possession of his senses believe that these things had been\r\ndone to protect life and property and preserve law and order?\r\n\r\nThat is substantially the case that President Cleveland is trying to\r\nmake for himself and his administration out of their participation in\r\nthe Chicago strike.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   THE REAL LAWBREAKER THE RAILROADS.\r\n\r\nThe implication that runs through Mr. Cleveland’s entire article is that\r\nthe railway corporations were paragons of peace and patriotism, law and\r\norder, while the railway employes were a criminal, desperate and\r\nbloodthirsty mob which had to be suppressed by the strong arm of the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nNo wonder the ex-President is so dear to the iron heart of the railroad\r\ntrust and every other trust that uses the government and its officers\r\nand soldiers to further its own sordid ends.\r\n\r\nLet us consider for a moment these simple questions:\r\n\r\nWho are the more law-abiding, the predatory railroad corporations or the\r\nhard-worked railroad employes?\r\n\r\nWhat railroad corporation in the United States lives up to the law of\r\nthe land? Not one.\r\n\r\nWhat body of railroad employes violates it? Not one.\r\n\r\n\r\n              THE BRAZEN DEFIANCE OF LAW BY THE RAILROADS.\r\n\r\nThe railroad corporations are notorious for their brazen defiance of\r\nevery law that is designed to curb their powers or restrain their\r\nrapacity.\r\n\r\nThe railroad corporations have their lobby at Washington and at every\r\nState capital; they bribe legislators, corrupt courts, debauch politics\r\nand commit countless other legal and moral crimes against the\r\ncommonwealth.\r\n\r\nThe railway employes are a body of honest, useful, self-sacrificing,\r\npeace-loving men, who never have been, and never will be, guilty of the\r\ncrimes committed by their corporate masters.\r\n\r\nAnd yet President Cleveland serves the corporate masters and exalts and\r\nglorifies the act while he attempts to absolve the criminals and fasten\r\nthe insufferable stigma upon honest men.\r\n\r\nNothing further is required to demonstrate beyond all cavil the\r\ncapitalist class character of our present government.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE STRIKE COMMISSION’S REPORT.\r\n\r\nNow for a few facts about the strike. It began May 11, 1894, and was\r\nperfectly peaceable and orderly until the army of “thugs, thieves and\r\nex-convicts,” as Superintendent of Police Brennan called them in his\r\nofficial report to the Council of Chicago, were sworn in as deputies by\r\nthe United States marshal at the command of Edwin Walker, attorney of\r\nthe General Managers’ Association and special counsel to the government.\r\nLet us quote the report of the Strike Commission, consisting of Carroll\r\nD. Wright, Commissioner of Labor, who served ex-officio; John D. Kernan,\r\nof New York, and N. E. Worthington, of Illinois, two lawyers, appointed\r\nby President Cleveland.\r\n\r\nLet it be noted that the railway employes, that is to say, labor, the\r\nworking class, had no representative on this Commission.\r\n\r\nFrom the report they issued we quote as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                A. R. U. LEADERS ADVISE AGAINST STRIKE.\r\n\r\n“It is undoubtedly true that the officers and directors of the American\r\nRailway Union did not want a strike at Pullman and advised against it. *\r\n* * (P. xxvii.) (Yet the people were told over and over and still\r\nbelieve that Debs ordered the strike.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                       RAILROADS SET THE EXAMPLE.\r\n\r\n“It should be noted that until the railroads set the example a general\r\nunion of railroad employes was never attempted.” (P. xxxi.)\r\n\r\n“The refusal of the General Managers’ Association to recognize and deal\r\nwith such a combination of labor as the American Railway Union seems\r\narrogant and absurd when we consider its standing before the law, its\r\nassumptions, and its past and obviously contemplated future action.” (P.\r\nxxxi.)\r\n\r\n“* * * the rents (at Pullman) are from 20 to 25 per cent higher than\r\nrents in Chicago or surrounding towns for similar accommodations.” (P.\r\nxxxv.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                STRIKE COMMISSION CONTRADICTS CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n“The strike occurred on May 11, and from that time until the soldiers\r\nwent to Pullman, about July 4, 300 strikers were placed about the\r\ncompany’s property, professedly to guard it from destruction or\r\ninterference. This guarding of property in strikes is, as a rule, a mere\r\npretense. Too often the real object of guards is to prevent newcomers\r\nfrom taking the strikers’ places, by persuasion, often to be followed,\r\nif ineffectual, by intimidation and violence. The Pullman Company claims\r\nthis was the real object of these guards. _These strikers at Pullman are\r\nentitled to be believed to the contrary in this matter, because of their\r\nconduct and forbearance after May 11. It is in evidence, and\r\nuncontradicted, that no violence or destruction of property by strikers\r\nor sympathizers took place at Pullman, and that until July 3_ (when the\r\nFederal troops came upon the scene) _no extraordinary protection was had\r\nfrom the police and military against even anticipated disorder_.” (P.\r\nxxxviii.)\r\n\r\nThis paragraph from the report of Mr. Cleveland’s own Commission is\r\nsufficient answer to Mr. Cleveland’s article. It is conclusive,\r\ncrushing, overwhelming.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     DEPUTIES STARTED THE TROUBLE.\r\n\r\nThere was no trouble at Pullman, nor at Chicago, nor elsewhere, until\r\nthe railroad-United States deputy marshals were sworn in, followed by\r\nthe Federal troops.\r\n\r\nGovernor Altgeld, patriot and statesman, knew it and protested against\r\nthe troops.\r\n\r\nMayor John P. Hopkins knew it and declared that he was fully competent\r\nto preserve the peace of the city.\r\n\r\n\r\n             SUPERINTENDENT OF POLICE CALLED THEM “THUGS.”\r\n\r\nMichael Brennan, superintendent of the Chicago police, knew it and\r\ndenounced the deputy marshals Edwin Arnold’s hirelings, the General\r\nManagers’ Association’s incendiaries and sluggers, as “thugs, thieves\r\nand ex-convicts.”\r\n\r\nThese were the “gentlemen” President Cleveland’s government pressed into\r\nservice upon requisition of the railroads to preserve order and protect\r\nlife and property, and this is what the ex-President calls “the power of\r\nthe National government to protect itself in the exercise of its\r\nfunctions.”\r\n\r\nAs to just what these “functions” are when Grover Cleveland is\r\nPresident, the railroad corporations understand to a nicety and agree to\r\nby acclamation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        PROFOUND PEACE RESTORED.\r\n\r\nThe only trouble, when the “deputies” were sworn in, followed by the\r\nsoldiers, was that there was no trouble. That is the secret of\r\nsubsequent proceedings. The railroads were paralyzed. Profound peace\r\nreigned. The people demanded of the railroads that they operate their\r\ntrains. They could not do it. Not a man would serve them. They were\r\ncompletely defeated and the banners of organized labor floated\r\ntriumphant in the breeze.\r\n\r\nBeaten at every point, their schemes all frustrated, outgeneraled in\r\ntactics and strategy, the corporations played their trump card by an\r\nappeal to the Federal judiciary and the Federal administration. To this\r\nappeal the response came quick as lightning from a storm cloud.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 PEACE FATAL TO MANAGERS’ ASSOCIATION.\r\n\r\nPeace and order were fatal to the railroad corporations. Violence was as\r\nnecessary to them as peace was to the employes. They realized that\r\nvictory could only be snatched from labor by an appeal to violence in\r\nthe name of peace.\r\n\r\nFirst, deputy marshals. The very day they were appointed the trouble\r\nbegan. The files of every Chicago paper prove it. The report of the\r\nStrike Commission does the same.\r\n\r\nThat was what they were hired for and their character is sufficient\r\nevidence of their guilt.\r\n\r\nSecond, fires (but no Pullman palace cars were lighted) and riots (but\r\nno strikers were implicated).\r\n\r\nThird, the capitalist-owned newspapers and Associated Press flashed the\r\nnews over all the wires that the people were at the mercy of a mob and\r\nthat the strikers were burning and sacking the city.\r\n\r\nFourth, the people (especially those at a distance who knew nothing\r\nexcept what they saw in the papers) united in the frenzied cry: “Down\r\nwith anarchy! Down with the A. R. U.! Death to the strikers!”\r\n\r\n\r\n                DISTURBANCES STARTED BY DEPUTY MARSHALS.\r\n\r\nThe first trouble instigated by the deputy marshals was the signal for\r\nthe Federal Court injunctions, and they came like a succession of\r\nlightning flashes.\r\n\r\nNext, the general offices of the American Railway Union were sacked and\r\nput under guard and communication destroyed. (Later Judge Grosscup\r\nrebuked the Federal satraps who committed this outrageous crime, but he\r\ndid not pretend to bring them to justice.)\r\n\r\nNext, the leaders of the strike were arrested, not for crime, but for\r\nalleged violation of an injunction.\r\n\r\nNext, they were brought into court, denied trial by jury, pronounced\r\nguilty by the same judge who had issued the injunction, and sent to jail\r\nfor from three to six months.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 THE CONCLUDING WORDS NOT YET WRITTEN.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of the United States, consisting wholly of trained and\r\nsuccessful corporation lawyers, affirmed the proceeding and President\r\nCleveland says that they have “written the concluding words of this\r\nhistory.”\r\n\r\nDid the Supreme Court of the United States write the “concluding words”\r\nin the history of chattel slavery when it handed down Chief Justice\r\nTaney’s decision that black men had “no rights that the white man was\r\nbound to respect?”\r\n\r\nThese “concluding words” will but hasten the overthrow of wage slavery\r\nas the “concluding words” of the same Supreme Court in 1857 hastened the\r\noverthrow of chattel slavery.\r\n\r\nThe railroad corporations would rather have destroyed their property and\r\nseen Chicago perish than see the American Railway Union triumphant in as\r\nnoble a cause as ever prompted sympathetic, manly men to action in this\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      PEACE OVERTURES TURNED DOWN.\r\n\r\nThe late Mayor Pingree of Detroit came to Chicago with telegrams from\r\nthe mayors of over fifty of the largest cities urging that there should\r\nbe arbitration. (P. xxxix, Report of Strike Commission.) He was turned\r\ndown without ceremony, and afterwards declared that the railroads were\r\nthe only criminals and that they were responsible for all the\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\nJune 22, four days before the strike against the railroads, or, rather,\r\nthe boycott of Pullman cars, took effect, there was a joint meeting of\r\nthe railroad and Pullman officials. (P. xlii, Report of Strike\r\nCommission.) At this meeting it was resolved to defeat the strikers,\r\nwipe out the American Railway Union, and, to use their exact words,\r\n“that we act unitedly to that end.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  DEBS’ RELEASE FROM WOODSTOCK JAIL\r\n]\r\n\r\nThis was the only joint meeting of the kind that had ever been held\r\nbetween the officials of the railroad companies and the Pullman company.\r\nThey mutually determined to stand together to defeat the strike and\r\ndestroy the union.\r\n\r\nNow, to show what regard these gentlemen have for courts and law and\r\nmorals, this incident will suffice:\r\n\r\n\r\n                 RAILWAY OFFICIALS PERJURE THEMSELVES.\r\n\r\nWhen the officers of the American Railway Union were indicted by a\r\nspecial and packed grand jury and placed on trial for conspiracy, the\r\ngeneral managers of the railroads were put on the witness stand to\r\ntestify as to what action had been taken at the joint railroad and\r\nPullman meeting described, and each and every one of them perjured\r\nhimself by swearing that he had no recollection of what had taken place\r\nat that meeting. Sitting within a few feet of them I saw their faces\r\nturn scarlet under the cross-examination, knowing that they were\r\ntestifying falsely; that the court knew it, and that every one present\r\nknew it; but they stuck to their agreement and uniformly failed to\r\nremember that they had resolved to stand together, the railroads\r\nagreeing to back the Pullman company in defeating their famishing\r\nemployes, and the Pullman company pledging itself to stand by the\r\nrailroads in destroying the American Railway Union.\r\n\r\nThat is what their own record shows they resolved to do, and a little\r\nlater they concluded to forget all about it, and to this they swore in a\r\nFederal Court of law.\r\n\r\nI have copies of the court records, including the testimony, to prove\r\nthis, and the files of all the Chicago dailies of that time contain the\r\nsame testimony.\r\n\r\nThese are the gentlemen who have so much to say about law and order—the\r\nvaunted guardians of morals and good citizenship.\r\n\r\nWhen A. B. Stickney, president of the Chicago Great Western, who had\r\nbeen victimized by them, told them to their faces that there was not an\r\nhonest official among them and that he would not trust one of them out\r\nof his sight, they did not attempt any defense, for they knew that their\r\naccuser was on the inside and in position to make good his assertions.\r\n\r\n\r\n               THE DEPUTIES AS VIEWED BY THE COMMISSION.\r\n\r\nI must now introduce a little evidence from the report of the Strike\r\nCommission bearing upon the United States deputy marshals who were sworn\r\nin by the railroads “to protect life and property and preserve the\r\npeace”:\r\n\r\nPage 356: Superintendent Brennan, of the Chicago police, testifies\r\nbefore the Commission that he has a number of deputy marshals in the\r\ncounty jail _arrested while serving the railroads as United States\r\ndeputy marshals for highway robbery_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     NEWSPAPER REPORTERS’ EVIDENCE.\r\n\r\nPage 370: Ray Stannard Baker, then a reporter for the Chicago _Record_,\r\nnow on the staff of _McClure’s Magazine_, testified as follows in answer\r\nto the question as to what he knew of the character of the deputy\r\nmarshals: “From my experience with them it was very bad. I saw more\r\ncases of drunkenness, I believe, among the United States deputy marshals\r\nthan I did among the strikers.”\r\n\r\nPages 366 and 367: Malcomb McDowell, reporter for the Chicago _Record_,\r\ntestified: “The United States deputy marshals and the special deputy\r\nsheriffs were sworn in by the hundreds about the 3d and 4th of July, and\r\nprior to that, too, and everybody who saw them knew they were not the\r\nclass of men who ought to be made deputy marshals or deputy sheriffs.” *\r\n* * “In regard to most of the deputy marshals they seemed to be hunting\r\ntrouble all the time.” * * * “At one time a serious row nearly resulted\r\nbecause some of the deputy marshals standing on the railroad track\r\njeered at the women that passed and insulted them.” * * * “I saw more\r\ndeputy marshals drunk than I saw strikers drunk.”\r\n\r\nThese were Edwin Walker’s justly celebrated guardians of the peace.\r\n\r\nPage 370: Harold I. Cleveland, reporter for the Chicago _Herald_,\r\ntestified: “I was on the tracks of the Western Indiana fourteen days.” *\r\n* * “I saw in that time a couple of hundred deputy marshals. I think\r\nthey were a very low, contemptible set of men.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                    HIRED AND PAID BY THE RAILROADS.\r\n\r\nNow follows what the Strike Commissioners themselves have to say about\r\nthe deputy marshals, and their words are specially commended to the\r\nthoughtful consideration of their chief, President Cleveland: “United\r\nStates deputy marshals, to the number of 3,600, were selected by and\r\nappointed at request of the General Managers’ Association, and of its\r\nrailroads. They were armed and paid by the railroads, and acted in the\r\ndouble capacity of railroad employes and United States officers. While\r\noperating the railroads they assumed and exercised unrestricted United\r\nStates authority when so ordered by their employers, or whenever they\r\nregarded it as necessary. They were not under the direct control of any\r\ngovernment official while exercising authority. This is placing officers\r\nof the government under control of a combination of railroads. It is a\r\nbad precedent, that might well lead to serious consequences.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                THE GOVERNMENT SERVES THE CORPORATIONS.\r\n\r\nHere we have it, upon the authority of President Cleveland’s own\r\nCommission, that the United States government under his administration\r\nfurnished the railroad corporations with government officers in the form\r\nof deputy marshals to take the places of striking employes, operate the\r\ntrains and serve in that dual capacity in any way that might be required\r\nto crush out the strike. This is perhaps more credit than the\r\nex-President expected to receive. His own Commission charges him, in\r\neffect, with serving the railroads as strike-breaker by furnishing\r\ngovernment employes to take the places of striking railroad men and\r\narming them with pistols and clubs and with all the authority of\r\ngovernment officials.\r\n\r\nPage after page bears testimony of the disreputable character of the\r\ndeputy marshals sworn in to the number of several thousand and turned\r\nloose like armed bullies to “preserve the peace.”\r\n\r\nThe report of the Strike Commission contains 681 pages. I have a mass of\r\nother testimony, but for the purpose of this article have confined\r\nmyself to the report of Mr. Cleveland’s own Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    HOW THE STRIKERS WERE DEFEATED.\r\n\r\nHundreds of pages of evidence are given by impartial witnesses to\r\nestablish the guilt of the railroad corporations, to prove that the\r\nleaders of the strike counselled peace and order; that the strikers\r\nthemselves were law-abiding and used their influence to prevent\r\ndisorder; that there was no trouble until the murderous deputy marshals\r\nwere sprung upon the community, and that these instigated trouble to\r\npave the way for injunctions and soldiers and change of public\r\nsentiment, thereby defeating the strike.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        CONFIRMED BY CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\nPresident Cleveland, unwittingly, confirms this fact. On page 232 of his\r\narticle he quotes approvingly the letter written to Edwin Walker,\r\nspecial counsel of the government and regular counsel of the railroads,\r\nby Attorney-General Richard Olney, as follows: “It has seemed to me that\r\nif the rights of the United States (Railroads?) were vigorously asserted\r\nin Chicago, the origin and center of the demonstration, the result would\r\nbe to make it a failure everywhere else, and to prevent its spread over\r\nthe entire country.”\r\n\r\nThat is the point, precisely the point, and Mr. Cleveland admits it. It\r\nis not the “obstruction of the mails,” nor disorder, nor the violation\r\nof law, that arouses Mr. Cleveland’s government and prompts it to\r\n“vigorous” assertion of its powers, but the “demonstration,” that is,\r\nthe strike against the railroads; and to put this down, not to move the\r\nmails or restore order—a mere pretext which was fully exposed by\r\nGovernor Altgeld—was the prime cause of Federal interference, and to\r\n“make it a failure everywhere” all constitutional restraints were\r\nbattered down, and as a strike-breaker President Cleveland won\r\nimperishable renown.\r\n\r\n\r\n              STRIKE LEADERS EXONERATED BY THE COMMISSION.\r\n\r\nParticular attention is invited to the following, which appears on page\r\nxlv:\r\n\r\n“There is no evidence before the Commission that the officers of the\r\nAmerican Railway Union at any time participated in or advised\r\nintimidation, violence or destruction of property. _They knew and fully\r\nappreciated that as soon as mobs ruled the organized forces of society\r\nwould crush the mobs and all responsible for them in the remotest\r\ndegree, and that this means defeat._”\r\n\r\nAnd yet they all served prison sentences. Will President Cleveland\r\nplease explain why? And why they were refused a trial?\r\n\r\n\r\n               IN WHOSE INTERESTS WERE CRIMES COMMITTED?\r\n\r\nRead the above paragraph from the report of the Strike Commission and\r\nthen answer these questions:\r\n\r\nTo whose interest was it to have riots and fires, lawlessness and crime?\r\n\r\nTo whose advantage was it to have disreputable “deputies” do these\r\nthings?\r\n\r\nWhy were only freight cars, largely hospital wrecks, set on fire?\r\n\r\nWhy have the railroads not yet recovered damages from Cook county,\r\nIllinois, for failing to protect their property? Why are they so modest\r\nand patient with their suits?\r\n\r\nThe riots and incendiarism turned defeat into victory for the railroads.\r\nThey could have won in no other way. They had everything to gain and the\r\nstrikers everything to lose.\r\n\r\nThe violence was instigated in spite of the strikers, and the report of\r\nthe Commission proves that they made every effort in their power to\r\npreserve the peace.\r\n\r\nWhen a crime is committed in the dark the person who is supposed to be\r\nbenefitted by it is sought out as the probable culprit, but we are not\r\nrequired to rely upon presumption in this case, for the testimony\r\nagainst the railroads is too clear and complete and convincing to admit\r\nof doubt.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       IMPRISONED WITHOUT TRIAL.\r\n\r\nIf the crimes committed during the Chicago strike were chargeable to the\r\nstrikers, why were they not prosecuted? If not, why were they sentenced\r\nto prison?\r\n\r\nThe fact that they were flung into prison without evidence and without\r\ntrial, and the fact that the Supreme Court affirmed the outrage, seemed\r\nto afford Mr. Cleveland special satisfaction, and he accepts what he\r\ncalls the “concluding words” of the court as his own final vindication.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  DEBS’ FIRST GREETING BY THE COMMITTEE\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                       JUDGE TRUMBULL’S OPINION.\r\n\r\nThe late Senator and Judge Lyman Trumbull, for many years United States\r\nSenator, chairman of the Senate Committee on Judiciary, Supreme Judge of\r\nIllinois, author of the thirteenth amendment to the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States, personal friend of Abraham Lincoln, and, above all, an\r\nhonest man, wrote: “The doctrine announced by the Supreme Court in the\r\nDebs case places every citizen at the mercy of any prejudiced or\r\nmalicious Federal judge who may think proper to imprison him.”\r\n\r\nPresident Cleveland doubtless understands the import of these ominous\r\nwords. Let the people, the working people, whom the ex-President regards\r\nmerely as a mob to be suppressed when they peaceably protest against\r\ninjustice—let them contemplate these words at their leisure.\r\n\r\nWhen the strike was at its height and the railroads were defeated at\r\nevery turn, the Federal Court hastily impaneled a special grand jury to\r\nindict the strikers. The foreman of this jury was chosen specially\r\nbecause he was a violent union hater, and he afterward betrayed his own\r\ncapitalist colleagues in a matter they had entrusted to his integrity.\r\n\r\nThe jury was impaneled, not to investigate, but to indict.\r\n\r\nA _Tribune_ reporter, who refused to verify a false interview before the\r\njury, and thereby perjure himself to incriminate the writer, was\r\ndischarged. The Chicago _Times_ published the particulars.\r\n\r\nAn indictment was speedily returned. “To the penitentiary,” was the cry\r\nof the railroads and their henchmen. A trial jury was impaneled. Not a\r\njuror was accepted who was of the same political party as the\r\ndefendants. Every possible effort was made to rush the strike leaders to\r\nthe State prison.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION.\r\n\r\nAfter all the evidence of the prosecution had been presented they\r\nrealized that they had miserably failed. Not one particle of\r\nincriminating testimony could the railroads produce with all the sleuth\r\nhounds they had at their command.\r\n\r\nNext came our turn. The General Managers were dumbfounded when they\r\nwere, one after the other, put on the stand. Eighty-six witnesses were\r\nin court to testify as to the riots and fires. Assistant Chief Palmer\r\nand other members of the Fire Department were on hand to testify that\r\nwhen they were trying to extinguish the flames in the railroad yards\r\nthey caught men in the act of cutting the hose and that these men wore\r\nthe badges of deputy marshals. Other witnesses were policemen who were\r\nready to testify that they had caught these same deputies instigating\r\nviolence and acts of incendiarism.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE JURY DUMBFOUNDED.\r\n\r\nThe jury had been packed to convict. When our evidence began to come in\r\ntheir eyes fairly bulged with astonishment. There was a perfect\r\ntransformation scene. The jurors realized that they had been steeped in\r\nprejudice and grossly deceived.\r\n\r\nThe General Managers testified that they did not remember what had taken\r\nplace at the joint General Managers’ and Pullman meeting. Their printed\r\nproceedings were called for. They looked appealingly to Edwin Walker.\r\nThe terror that overspread their features can never be forgotten by\r\nthose who witnessed it. Their own printed proceedings would expose their\r\nmendacity and convict them of conspiracy and crime. Something must be\r\ndone, and done quickly. Court adjourned for lunch. When it reconvened\r\nJudge Grosscup gravely announced that a juror had been suddenly taken\r\nill and that the trial could not proceed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE “ILLNESS” OF A JUROR.\r\n\r\nThe next day and the next the same announcement was repeated. We offered\r\nto proceed in any of the several ways provided in such exigencies. The\r\nprosecution objected. The cry “To the penitentiary” had subsided. “To\r\nlet go” was now the order of the railroads. Not another session of court\r\nmust be held, for their printed proceedings, the private property in the\r\nstrong box of each member, and full of matter that would convict them,\r\nwould have to be produced. All the proceedings of the American Railway\r\nUnion had been produced in evidence by order of the court and the court\r\ncould not refuse to command the railroad officials to produce the\r\nproceedings of their association. These proceedings were brought in at\r\nthe closing session of the trial, but by order of the court the\r\ndefendants were forbidden to look into them, and Edwin Walker, the\r\ngovernment counsel, watched them with the faithful eye of a trusted\r\nguardian.\r\n\r\nWe were not allowed to examine the proceedings of the General Managers’\r\nAssociation, notwithstanding our proceedings, telegrams, letters and\r\nother private communications had been brought into court by order of the\r\njudge, inspected by Edwin Walker and others, and printed in the court\r\nrecords for public inspection.\r\n\r\nIt was at this point that the court adjourned and the juror was taken\r\n“ill.”\r\n\r\nTen years have elapsed. He is still “ill,” and we are still waiting for\r\nthe court to reconvene and the trial to proceed.\r\n\r\n\r\n               GOVERNMENT REFUSED TO GO ON WITH THE CASE.\r\n\r\nEvery proposition to continue the case was fiercely resisted by Edwin\r\nWalker, special counsel of the government and general counsel of the\r\nrailroads.\r\n\r\nClarence S. Darrow objected to Mr. Walker’s appearing in that dual\r\ncapacity, representing at the same time the government and the\r\nrailroads—the supposed justice of the one and the vengeful spirit of the\r\nother—but Judge Grosscup overruled the objection.\r\n\r\nThe trial was postponed again and again, the interest in it gradually\r\nsubsiding, and many months afterward, when it was almost forgotten, the\r\ncase was quietly stricken from the docket.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        JURORS GREET DEFENDANTS.\r\n\r\nWhen the remaining eleven jurors were discharged by the court, Edwin\r\nWalker extended his hand to them, but they rushed by him and surrounded\r\nthe writer and his co-defendants, grasping their hands and assuring\r\nthem, each and every one of them, that they were convinced of their\r\ninnocence and only regretted that they had been prevented from returning\r\ntheir verdict accordingly. The details appear in the Chicago papers of\r\nthat time.\r\n\r\nAt the very time we were being tried for conspiracy we were serving a\r\nsentence in prison for contempt, the program being that six months in\r\njail should be followed by as many years in penitentiary.\r\n\r\nFor a jury to pronounce us innocent in substantially the same case for\r\nwhich we were already serving a sentence would mean not only our\r\ncomplete vindication, but the exposure of the Federal Court that had, at\r\nthe behest of the railroads, sentenced us to prison without a trial.\r\n\r\nAnd so the trial was abruptly terminated on account of the alleged\r\nillness of a juror and they could find no other to take his place.\r\n\r\nThese are the facts and I have all the documentary evidence in detail,\r\nand only lack of space prevents me from making the exhibits in this\r\narticle.\r\n\r\nIf President Cleveland or the Railroad Managers doubt it I stand ready\r\nto meet them face to face in discussion of the issue upon any platform\r\nin America.\r\n\r\n\r\n               THE GREATEST INDUSTRIAL BATTLE IN HISTORY.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago strike was in many respects the grandest industrial battle\r\nin history, and I am prouder of my small share in it than of any other\r\nact of my life.\r\n\r\nMen, women and children were on the verge of starvation at the “model\r\ncity” of Pullman. They had produced the fabulous wealth of the Pullman\r\ncorporation, but they, poor souls, were compelled to suffer the torment\r\nof hunger pangs in the very midst of the abundance their labor had\r\ncreated.\r\n\r\nA hundred and fifty thousand railroad employes, their fellow members in\r\nthe American Railway Union, sympathized with them, shared their earnings\r\nwith them, and after trying in every peaceable way they could conceive\r\nof to touch the flint heart of the Pullman company—every overture being\r\nrejected, every suggestion denied, every proposition spurned with\r\ncontempt—they determined not to pollute their hands and dishonor their\r\nmanhood by handling Pullman cars and contributing to the suffering and\r\nsorrow of their brethren and their wives and babes. And rather than do\r\nthis they laid down their tools in a body, sacrificed their situations\r\nand submitted to persecution, exile and the blacklist; to idleness,\r\npoverty, crusts and rags, and I shall love and honor these moral heroes\r\nto my latest breath.\r\n\r\nThere was more of human sympathy, or the essence of brotherhood, of the\r\nspirit of real Christianity in this act than in all the hollow pretenses\r\nand heartless prayers of those disciples of mammon who cried out against\r\nit, and this act will shine forth in increasing splendor long after the\r\ndollar worshipers have mingled with the dust of oblivion.\r\n\r\nHad the carpenter of Nazareth been in Chicago at the time He would have\r\nbeen on the side of the poor, the heavy-laden and sore at heart, and He\r\nwould have denounced their oppressors and been sent to prison for\r\ncontempt of court under President Cleveland’s administration.\r\n\r\nPresident Cleveland says that we were put down because we had acted in\r\nviolation of the Sherman Anti-Trust law of 1890. Will he kindly state\r\nwhat other trusts were proceeded against and what capitalists were\r\nsentenced to prison during his administration?\r\n\r\n\r\n                         A TRIBUTE TO ALTGELD.\r\n\r\nHe waited ten years to cast his aspersions upon the honor of John P.\r\nAltgeld, and if that patriotic statesman had not fallen in the service\r\nof the people, if he were still here to defend his official acts, it is\r\nnot probable that the ex-President would have ventured to assail him.\r\n\r\nReluctantly, indeed, do I close without the space to incorporate his\r\nburning messages to President Cleveland and at least some extracts from\r\nhis masterly speech on “Government by Injunction.”\r\n\r\nHis memory requires no defense, but if it did I could speak better for\r\nhim than for myself. He never truckled to corporate wealth; he did not\r\ncompromise with his conscience; he was steadfast in his devotion to\r\ntruth and in his fidelity to right, and he sought with all his strength\r\nto serve the people and the people will gratefully remember him as one\r\nof the true men, one of the great souls of his sordid age.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago strike is not yet settled, and its “concluding pages” are\r\nYET TO BE WRITTEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            You Railroad Men\r\n\r\n            _Written for Appeal to Reason, February 3, 1906_\r\n\r\n                               _FOREWORD_\r\n\r\n_At the time this remarkable paper was written and published in the\r\nAppeal to Reason, two years ago, “fool dinner pail” prosperity\r\nflourished like a green bay tree._\r\n\r\n_One there was who, wanting an audience for his voice of warning, yet\r\nsounded with his pen a loud alarm. Debs had in the beginning of his\r\nlife’s labors allowed the railroad companies to coin his brawn and his\r\nbrain in their service, but had since devoted himself, with an\r\nearnestness sublime, to the study of the condition of wage workers in\r\ngeneral and railroad employes in particular. From his hard experience\r\nand many years of study he was in position to know, and he did know.\r\nWhatever else has been said, no detractor has questioned his honesty and\r\nthe fine fiber of his magnificent manhood._\r\n\r\n_Yet, his warning went unheeded. The so-called “labor press,” as well as\r\nthe capitalist papers, decried him as an alarmist and a mischiefmaker._\r\n\r\n_How swiftly and how accurately has his forecast been verified! We see\r\nthe system he has arraigned trembling and crashing, we hear the hunger\r\ntread of the unemployed, and the tragedy he foretold is in the\r\n“rat-tat-tat” on a million kitchen doors._\r\n\r\n_Industry is confounded and labor is confused. By the statement of the\r\nrailroad companies themselves a half million railroad workers alone are\r\nout of employment._\r\n\r\n_Choked into despair, it is to be hoped that Debs’ mighty appeal to\r\nthem, which is here republished, will now be read and assimilated by\r\nrailroad men and the way of Socialism learned._\r\n\r\n                                                           BRUCE ROGERS.\r\n\r\n _Girard, Kansas, March, 1908._\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis appeal is made particularly to railway employes, among whom I began\r\nmy career as a wage-worker, with whom I spent twenty-seven consecutive\r\nyears—the complete span of my young manhood—as co-employe, labor\r\norganizer and union official, and for whom I shall have an affectionate\r\nregard of peculiar tenderness that will end only with my days.\r\n\r\nThe very relation I bear them inspires me with the liveliest sense of\r\nobligation to that great body of brave and brawny men whose hands, as\r\nhard as their hearts are soft, first grasped my own in welcome as a\r\nrecruit to the army of toil; whose honest faces, beaming with approval,\r\nfirst warmed my heart and stirred my blood, and whose applause, the\r\nfirst I ever knew, fired my boyhood years with high resolves. In every\r\ndark and trying hour these comrades of my early years stood staunch and\r\ntrue and pushed me on and raised me up that others might see my face and\r\nknow my name, while they remained unnoticed, unapplauded, the soldiers\r\nof obscurity, the rank and file, the lower class, the common herd, who\r\nmade and move this world and who should be, and yet will be, its ruling\r\naristocracy.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI believe it can be said with truth, as I am sure it can without vanity,\r\nthat I personally know, and am personally known to, more railroad\r\nemployes than any other man in the country; and with equal truth, I\r\nbelieve, that the great majority who know me—better than this, the whole\r\nbody of them, with but few exceptions—feel kindly toward me, and may be\r\nclaimed my personal friends.\r\n\r\nIn all my travels—and I have been moving almost continually these twelve\r\nyears past, over all the railways of the continent, especially since the\r\nrailway corporations forcibly divorced me from their employes—in all my\r\ntravels I have never made a trip, nor ever expect to, without feeling\r\nmany times the touch of kindness, oft in stealth, of my old comrades of\r\nrailroad days.\r\n\r\nIt is not, therefore, because of any lessening of our mutual regard that\r\nI am no longer in active touch with them, but because of the stern\r\ndecree of fate which commanded me to go where they might not yet follow\r\nfor a while, but where they will be found in good time, united with\r\ntheir class, and battling manfully for freedom.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI could yet be the “grand” officer of a railway brotherhood, have a\r\ncomfortable office, a large salary, plenty of friends, including railway\r\nand public officials, and read my praises as an “ideal labor leader” in\r\ncapitalist newspapers, but my convictions would not allow it, and so I\r\nhad to resign, and having no choice about it, I am entitled to no credit\r\nfor quitting a “good” position and plunging recklessly into “a career of\r\nfolly, failure and disgrace.”\r\n\r\nIt was not easy to resign, and I had to insist upon it in a way that\r\nhurt me as much as it did the loyal brothers from whom I had to tear\r\nmyself apart; and it has been the first and almost the only case of\r\nvoluntary resignation from a similar organization.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI had been with the Brotherhood of locomotive firemen almost from its\r\nbirth; had organized the Brotherhood of Railroad Brakemen, now the\r\nBrotherhood of Railway Trainmen; had helped to organize the Switchmen’s\r\nMutual Aid Association, the Brotherhood of Railway Carmen, the Order of\r\nRailway Telegraphers, and other labor unions, and was now to organize,\r\nwith half a dozen others, the American Railway Union, to embrace all\r\nrailway workers, so that the engine wiper and section man might come in\r\nfor their share of consideration as well as the engineer and conductor.\r\n\r\nThere is where I broke with the railway officials. They were perfectly\r\nwilling that we should have a firemen’s union, but they were not willing\r\nfor us to have a union that would unite all employes in the service in\r\nthe equal interest of all.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis much by way of introduction. Now a word as to the purpose of this\r\nwriting. I have something to say to the railway employes of America. It\r\nmay not be considered as amounting to much, but I think it of importance\r\nenough to ask the railway workers to follow me through with patience,\r\nand think over what I have to say at their own leisure.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYou railroad men are told that I am too radical, that I am dangerous,\r\nthat as a “leader” I am a failure, and a good many other things, but the\r\ntime will come when you will know that from first to last I was true to\r\nyou, and because of that very fact the corporations you work for warn\r\nyou against me; and you will furthermore know that, for the opposite\r\nreason, most of your present leaders are not true to your best\r\ninterests. They are “popular” with the public, and your railway\r\nofficials sing their praises on every occasion and tell you over and\r\nagain how wise and good these “leaders” are and how lucky you are and\r\nhow proud you should be to command their valuable services.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTime will tell and I can wait. I am not courting your flattery nor\r\nevading your blame. I am seeking no office; aspiring to no honors; have\r\nno personal ax to grind. But I have something to say to you and shall\r\nlook straight into your eyes while saying it. I shall speak the truth—as\r\nI see it—no more and no less, in kindness and without malice or\r\nresentment.\r\n\r\nI should tell you what I think you ought to know though all of you\r\nturned against me and despised me.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI am not wiser than you, but have had more experience with capitalists\r\nand more chance to study their system of fleecing and fooling labor than\r\nmost of you. I am not better than you—not so good, in fact—for there is\r\nno better man on earth than an honest workingman. So I shall not preach\r\nto you, nor moralize you, nor even venture to advise you, but I shall\r\nput a few facts before you that may temporarily disturb your digestion,\r\nbut if you will stick to them and assimilate them you will feel yourself\r\ngrowing stronger and you will thank me for having changed your mental\r\nbill of fare.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTaken in the aggregate, there is no division of the working class more\r\nclannish and provincial, more isolated from other divisions of labor’s\r\ncountless army, than railway employes, the workers engaged, directly and\r\nindirectly, in steam railway transportation. Nor is there a group or\r\ndepartment in the entire working class that, outside of its own sphere\r\nof industrial activity, is more ignorant of the true essentials of the\r\nlabor question or more oblivious of the class struggle and the\r\nfundamental principles and objects of the labor movement.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo verify this statement it is not necessary to refer to the\r\nunorganized, unskilled and poorly-paid employes; on the contrary, let a\r\ndozen engineers and the same number of conductors, picked at random, be\r\nput upon the stand and catechized from a primer on economics and see\r\nwhat percentage of them can give even a definition of the term. They\r\nknow how to run engines and trains and, as a rule, that is practically\r\nthe limit of their knowledge. That is all the corporations want them to\r\nknow, and, from their point of view, all they are fit to know.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is true that they read journals published by their unions in which a\r\nfive-column account is given of a reception to some “noble grand chief,”\r\nand as many columns more about babies born and brothers buried, but\r\nwhich may be searched in vain for a line of revolutionary economics to\r\nnourish their brain, open the eyes, give cheer to the heart or\r\naspiration to the soul of a corporation slave.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe several unions of railway employes, considered in any militant\r\nsense, are not labor unions at all. Warren S. Stone, grand chief of the\r\nBrotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, worthy successor of the late P. M.\r\nArthur, is on record as having pledged his word to a well known railway\r\nmanager that the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers should never go out\r\non strike while he was its executive head. The same grand chief is on\r\nrecord as threatening John J. Hannahan, grand master of the Brotherhood\r\nof Locomotive Firemen, with keeping his engineers at work on the\r\nNorthern Pacific system, virtually scabbing on the firemen, if the\r\nlatter went out on strike.\r\n\r\nIf the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers was a bona fide labor union\r\ninstead of the fossilized tool of railway corporations its grand chief\r\nwould be peremptorily impeached for treason to the working class.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Civic Federation Review_ loves to print the portrait of Mr. Stone\r\nand idealize him as a “leader of labor” worthy to sit at the feast with,\r\nand at the feet of, August Belmont, Andrew Carnegie, Archbishop Ireland\r\nand other millionaire labor exploiters who regard workingmen as sheep to\r\nbe sheared and skinned and slaughtered, and asses to be harnessed and\r\nworked and whipped, and, from that point of view, the engineers and the\r\nrest of the railway unions are to be congratulated upon their astute\r\nleadership.\r\n\r\nIt is not that Mr. Stone is personally dishonest and corrupt; he may be,\r\nand I think he is, perfectly conscientious in what he says and does, and\r\nthe same is doubtless true of the grand officers of the other railway\r\nunions, but that is not the question.\r\n\r\nIf workingmen are betrayed and defeated and made to suffer, it makes\r\nlittle difference if their misfortunes are due to dishonest, or ignorant\r\nand incompetent, leadership.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe question is not, Are these leaders honest? Let that be conceded. The\r\nquestion is, Are they true to the working class? If their official\r\nattitude does not square with the working class as a whole, then they\r\nare not in line with the true interests of their own union and are not\r\n_in fact_ the friends, but the enemies of labor; not serving, but\r\nbetraying those who trust and follow them.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn saying this and making the further statement that the existing\r\nrailway brotherhoods are of far more actual benefit to the railway\r\ncorporations than they are to the employes who support them, and that in\r\nsome essential respects they are a positive detriment to their members\r\nin teaching them to venerate a “grand” officer, subjecting themselves,\r\nbound and gagged, to his “official sanction,” and in keeping them in\r\neconomic ignorance—in saying these things, it is possible that Grand\r\nChief Stone of the Engineers, and other “grand” officials will take\r\nissue; and here let me say that nothing would please me better than the\r\nchance to meet Mr. Stone before his engineers, or any other grand\r\nofficial before his followers, at any time, or in any public place, to\r\nprove every assertion herein made, and more, too; and I shall not object\r\nif the grand officers invite their friends, the railway officials, to\r\noccupy their accustomed seats on the platform, but I will not guarantee\r\nthat the menu will be as agreeable to their corporation palates as that\r\nserved at a recent Chicago banquet of the Order of Railway Conductors,\r\nor at the average brotherhood convention.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNow to another branch of the question: According to the report of the\r\ninterstate commerce commission there were, for the year ended June 30,\r\n1904, a total of 1,206,121 employes on the railways of the United\r\nStates, as against 1,017,653 in 1900, an increase in four years of\r\n278,468. How many thousands of unemployed there are, ready to take jobs\r\nwhen they are offered, in event of a strike, or otherwise, the reports\r\ndo not say. Since 1904 there has been great increase in railroad\r\nactivities and it is probable that the total has since reached\r\n1,400,000. In 1894 the number was 779,608. That was during the last\r\nperiod of “hard times.” In the ten years since, from 1894 to 1904, from\r\n“panic” to “prosperity,” the number of railway employes has been almost\r\ndoubled, the actual increase being 620,392, an average of over 60,000 a\r\nyear. Fully five hundred thousand (500,000) new railroad men have been\r\nmade in that time, and they have swelled the brotherhoods to\r\nunprecedented limits.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNow keep your eye “peeled” for the signal for the return trip from\r\n“prosperity” to “panic.”\r\n\r\nThat is not a matter of guess, but of arithmetic.\r\n\r\nIt may not come next month nor next year, but it will come, and the\r\nlonger it is coming the longer will be the backward trip.\r\n\r\nRailway employes, as a rule, do not know why there are alternating\r\nperiods of “panic” and “prosperity”; panic that paralyzes, but\r\nprosperity that does not prosper, except for the plutocrats. The reason\r\nthey do not know is that they are ignorant of working class economics,\r\nwhich are not discussed by their leaders, nor in their journals, and\r\nthis accounts for the further fact that nearly all of them vote these\r\nsufferings upon themselves, as non-political labor unionists uniformly\r\ndo, while their unions, vaccinated by the corporation doctor against\r\npolitics, become parties to “grand balls,” such as the Brotherhood of\r\nLocomotive Firemen has given in Chicago, and the “grand banquet” held by\r\nthe Order of Railway Conductors in the same city, where the “grand\r\nmarch” is led by the capitalist mayor and a “grand” officer, and “grand”\r\nofficials of the railroads beam approvingly, while “grand” corporation\r\npoliticians disport themselves in huge diamonds and swallow-tails and\r\n“grand” speeches are spouted about the “brotherhood of capital and\r\nlabor,” the choicest lobster on the bill; the whole “green goods” affair\r\nbeing concocted by a tool of the corporations who belongs to the union\r\nand who, as a smooth politician, is on the pay roll at the city hall, or\r\nthe state house, or capitol. Such nauseating exhibitions—planned by\r\nsycophants and patronized by plutocrats—are given to hoodwink the common\r\nherd and keep it forever in the capitalist corrals of wage slavery.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPolitical conspiracy is the term to apply to these doings of the\r\nhenchmen of capital, masquerading in the garb of labor, who are so\r\nfearful that their dupes may wake up and go into politics.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut to return for a moment. Keep your eye open for that signal! When\r\nWall Street says the word you’ll see the signal, but it will not prevent\r\nyou and your little union from going into the ditch. The signal and the\r\nslump will come together.\r\n\r\nSeveral hundred thousand of you will be left high and dry; no jobs, but\r\nplenty of time to tramp and think. What next? Sweeping reductions of\r\nwages. Next—Strikes? Probably. And then? Defeat and disaster!\r\n\r\nThat’s the history of all the “panics” of the last thirty years. They\r\nhave all been ushered in with widespread railroad strikes, and when the\r\ncrash has come the brotherhoods have burst like bubbles and been crushed\r\nlike egg-shells, utterly powerless to give their members the least\r\nparticle of protection. This is what has uniformly come to the unions\r\nthat waste their time at such child’s play as “exemplification of secret\r\nwork” and studying signs and passwords, as if every corporation did not\r\nhave its union reporter to inform it of every move worth knowing.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd so it will be again. Mark it! Make a note of it! Ask your grand\r\nofficer about it and make a note of his answer. Don’t allow him to dodge\r\nby calling me a calamity howler. He will help you after the lightning\r\nhas struck your job by certifying that you are entitled to another, but\r\nyou will have to hunt it alone, and in the meantime the “brotherhood of\r\ncapital and labor” will have suspended and cannot save your wife from\r\neviction, nor your children from starvation.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThink it out; don’t let go till you do! Don’t take my word; rely on\r\nyourself! I can’t help you railway slaves. You only can help yourselves.\r\nNo one else can. If you don’t even know that you are slaves in the\r\nexisting capitalist system, the gods have mercy on you, for your\r\nblindness is complete; your condition is pitiable and there is no hope\r\nfor you but death.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe most pathetic object to me is a corporation slave with a dazzling\r\ndiamond or a constellation of brass buttons to decorate his deformity\r\nand hide the hollows in his gray matter. He swells like a toad as he\r\ntalks about the good wages “we” are paying; he is a part of the\r\ncorporation, as a pimple is a part of the plutocrat. He has hinges in\r\nhis knees. He fawns like a spaniel at the feet of an official, but\r\nsnarls like a cur at the car inspector or track man. He believes in the\r\n“brotherhood of capital and labor”; he is “conservative”; is opposed to\r\npolitics in the union or the journal; talks about his masters as “our\r\nsuperiors”; is proud of his pusillanimity; does with alacrity what he is\r\nordered to do and asks no questions; is a scab at heart, if not in fact;\r\nhas no trace of manhood, no self-respect, no honor—craven-hearted and\r\nstony-souled—and when he dies Judas Iscariot will have another recruit\r\nfor his army of the damned.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn his address to the joint committee of the several brotherhoods of\r\nrailway employes that called at the White House on November 14, 1905, to\r\nplead in behalf of the railway corporations, President Roosevelt, among\r\nother things, said: “I would be false to your interests if I failed to\r\ndo justice to the capitalist as much as to the wage-worker.”\r\n\r\nThe president was much impressed by the delegation and the delegation by\r\nhim. The president was really addressing his own brethren, for, like\r\nthemselves, he was a brotherhood man, and had the grip, sign and\r\npass-words, all up to date; and they were all agreed that no injustice\r\nmust be done the poor capitalists. The latter themselves were not in\r\nevidence. Their president and their brotherhoods would see that no harm\r\ncame to them.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn his message to the banquet of the Order of Railway Conductors, given\r\nat Chicago on December 31, 1905, in behalf of the railroad corporations,\r\nand presided over by Major (?) B. B. Ray, paymaster, U. S. A., in\r\nrecognition of his faithful services in lining up railway employes in\r\nsupport of the corporation ticket on election day, and as smooth a\r\npolitician as ever came down the avenue—in his communication to this\r\ncorporation auxiliary, regretting his inability to mingle with the\r\nrailway presidents and managers who were in attendance to point around\r\nat the conductors as evidence that the working class in general, and the\r\nrailway slaves in particular, were opposed to rate legislation—in his\r\ntelegram of regret Vice-President Fairbanks, once himself a railroad\r\nattorney and now a magnate, said:\r\n\r\n“The Order of Railway Conductors * * * recognizes in full degree the\r\nright of both employer and employe and understands full well that in a\r\nlarge sense the interests of one are the interests of the other, and\r\nthat the interests of neither can be disregarded without harm to both.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPrecisely! “Our interests are one,” exclaimed the fox, after devouring\r\nthe goose. “Same here,” answered the hawk, with the feathers of the dove\r\nstill clinging to his beak. “I’m with you,” chipped in the shark; and “I\r\ncongratulate you upon your wise political economy” was the amen of the\r\nlion as the lamb’s tail disappeared down the red lane.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nToastmaster Ray, the mortgaged major of the railroads, read another\r\ntelegram of regret from President “Jim” Hill, of the Great Northern, and\r\nthen President Delano, of the Wabash, was introduced and proceeded to\r\norate on “Opposition to Railroad Rate Legislation.” The dummies are\r\nreported to have nodded in hearty approval every time he looked at them.\r\nPresident Delano might have stayed at home and used a string to operate\r\nhis puppets.\r\n\r\nUpon this important point of “identity of interests,” between lion and\r\nmutton, President Roosevelt, Vice-President Fairbanks and all the\r\nrailroad presidents, corporations and brotherhoods are a unit.\r\n\r\nThe railroads furnish the lion and the brotherhoods the mutton.\r\n\r\nIt is upon this false basis, this vicious assumption, this fundamental\r\nlie, that the railroad brotherhoods are organized, and in that capacity\r\nthey are of incalculable value to the railroads, the very bulwarks of\r\ntheir defense, and the sure means of keeping the great body of railway\r\nemployes in economic ignorance, and, therefore, unorganized, divided and\r\nhelpless.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuch unionism means organized strength for the railroads and organized\r\nweakness for the employes. And the latter foot the bill. No wonder their\r\ngrand officers get annual passes and their delegates free trains. The\r\nstupid employes pay for them all an hundredfold.\r\n\r\nAnd to what base purpose the railroad magnates put these brotherhoods to\r\nstill further entrench their power and perpetuate their reign of\r\nrobbery!\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt this very moment they are using them as political pokers to stir up\r\nthe fire of public sentiment against rate legislation. And the poor\r\ndupes that pay the dues don’t even know that their unions are in\r\npolitics, corporation politics, the dirtiest of all politics.\r\n\r\nOn their own account the unions are forbidden to have anything to do\r\nwith politics—that would fracture their delicate diaphragm—but when the\r\ncorporations need them as political tools—ah, that’s different; that’s\r\nwhat they are for!\r\n\r\nCannot you hoodwinked railway slaves begin to see something?\r\n\r\nIn all the history of organized labor, from the earliest times to the\r\npresent day, no body of union workingmen ever served in a more\r\nhumiliating and debasing role than that in which the railway unions\r\nappear at this very hour before the American people and the world.\r\n\r\nIt is a spectacle for the gods, and future generations will marvel that\r\nsuch an exhibition of servility was possible in the twentieth century.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nUnion workingmen, rallying round the robbers of the working class, and\r\ndefending them against their own people!\r\n\r\nIt is true that there is nothing in rate legislation for the workingman,\r\nbut the incident loses none of its significance on that account.\r\n\r\nThe free use of the brotherhoods by and for the corporations, at\r\nelection time, when the legislature meets, when congress is in session,\r\nwhenever and wherever required—that is the point.\r\n\r\nHow smoothly this emergency appliance works!\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe corporations sniff danger; they send for their officials—the\r\nofficials for the “grand chiefs” of the brotherhoods—the “grand chiefs”\r\nfor their decoy ducks, and presto! a joint committee—and it is a “joint”\r\ncommittee—serves notice on the president and the country that the\r\nmillion and more railway employes want no interference with the divine\r\nright of the railroad robbers to hold up the people.\r\n\r\nThen another set of political tools of the same robbers take their cue\r\nand bound to their feet in the capitalist congress and in a serio-comic\r\nburst of paid-for passion, exclaim: “Don’t you see, gentlemen, that\r\norganized labor, the horny-handed nobility of the land, the muscle and\r\nsinew, the very backbone of the nation, recognizes this measure as a\r\nmenace to its “full dinner pail” and interposes its righteous\r\nindignation! Gentlemen, we dare not make such an assault upon the\r\ndignity, the sacred rights, aye, the very life of honest toil!”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat settles it! The trick is done. The Goulds, Vanderbilts and\r\nHarrimans are on top, their slaves at the bottom, and their “identity of\r\ninterests” is once more triumphantly vindicated.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI purpose now to deal briefly with that ghastly lie itself.\r\n\r\nIn what way, Mr. Railroad Slave, is your interest identical with that of\r\n“Jim” Hill, your master?\r\n\r\nHe owns the railway system that you workingmen built and now operate.\r\n\r\nHe pulls every dollar of profit out of it for himself he can, and leaves\r\nyou not one dollar more than he must.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf you don’t suit him, he discharges you, and you then have to pull up\r\nstakes and hunt another master. He gets the lion’s share, you get what’s\r\nleft; and in the aggregate that is fixed by what is required to fill\r\nyour dinner pail, cover you with overalls and maintain a habitation\r\nwhere you can raise more wage-slaves to take your place when you are\r\nworn out and go to the scrap heap.\r\n\r\nThe “Jim” Hills live out of your labor—out of your ignorance—for if you\r\nwere not densely stupid you would not be their dumb-driven cattle.\r\n\r\nNow they and their politicians and preachers and “labor leaders” tell\r\nyou how bright and smart you are to flatter your ignorance, and keep you\r\nfrom opening your eyes to your slavish condition, and above all, to the\r\nwage-system, which lies at the bottom of your poverty and degradation.\r\n\r\nYour interests as wage-slaves are not only _not_ identical with, but are\r\ndirectly opposed to, the interests of the “Jim” Hills and the railroad\r\ncorporations, and I challenge any of your “grand chiefs” to deny it in\r\nmy presence on any public platform.\r\n\r\nYou have got to get rid of the capitalist leeches that suck your hearts’\r\nblood through the quill of “identity of interests.”\r\n\r\nThey are in the capitalist class; you are in the working class. They\r\ngouge out profits; what’s left you get for wages. They perform no useful\r\nwork; you deform your bodies with slavery. They are millionaires; you\r\nare paupers. They have everything; you do everything. They live in\r\npalaces; you in shanties. They have abundance of leisure and mountains\r\nof money; you have neither. Finally, they are few; _you are legions_!\r\n\r\nPoor, dumb giant, you could in a breath extinguish your pigmy exploiter,\r\nwere you only conscious of your overmastering power!\r\n\r\nThe workers made and operate all the railroads; the capitalists had and\r\nhave nothing to do with either. They pocket the proceeds on a basis of\r\nwatered stock and other “stock,” in the form of employes, and then issue\r\nfraudulent reports to show on what a small margin of profit they are\r\nactually doing business.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it should be said that the railroads pad their\r\n“operating expenses” outrageously to deceive their employes and the\r\ngeneral public, and their reports can be shown to be full of duplicity\r\nand fraud. They are not required to itemize their “operating expenses”\r\nin their reports to the interstate commerce commission; this they only\r\ndo in the reports of the directors to the stockholders, and an\r\nexamination of these will disclose the swindle and show how much\r\nreliance can be placed in the public reports of private grafters.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Railway Slave, to resume our interview, you are not in the same\r\nclass with the “Jim” Hills of the railroads. You don’t visit their\r\nhomes; nor they at yours. You don’t ride in their private cars and\r\nyachts and automobiles. Your wives don’t wear the same kind of clothes\r\nand jewelry and move in the same circle with theirs. You don’t join them\r\nin their luxuriant travels to Europe when they are received by the\r\ncrowned heads and other parasites and given a private audience by the\r\npope. You stay at home and sweat and suffer to foot all the bills; they\r\ndo all the rest.\r\n\r\nTo sum up: They are in the capitalist class; you in the working class.\r\nThey are masters; you slaves. They fleece and pluck; you furnish the\r\nwool and feathers.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat is the basis of the class struggle.\r\n\r\nUpon that basis you have got to organize and fight before you can move\r\nan inch toward freedom.\r\n\r\nYou have got to unite in the same labor union and in the same political\r\nparty and _strike and vote together_, and the hour you do that, the\r\nworld is yours.\r\n\r\nThe railroads will oppose this; they want to keep you divided and at\r\ntheir mercy. Your grand officers will oppose it; they want to keep you\r\ndivided and continue to draw their salaries.\r\n\r\nWhen you have a little time figure out the amount annually paid to the\r\ngrand officers of the railway unions in salaries and expenses, and you\r\nwill be amazed; you will also understand why railroad employes will\r\nnever get together as long as their grand officers can prevent it.\r\n\r\nBy the way, why do you persist in calling your officers “Grand Chiefs”\r\nand “Grand Masters”? Are they “grand” because you are petty?\r\n\r\nThe working class, the rank and file, are _grander_ than all the labor\r\nleaders, good and bad, that ever lived.\r\n\r\nA “Master” implies slaves. It is bad enough to be slaves without\r\nglorying in it. A “Master” is bad enough; a “Grand Master” is the limit,\r\nespecially if the title is voluntarily conferred by the slaves.\r\n\r\nThere was a time when I did not realize this and many other things I now\r\ndo. The difference is that I have learned to think and can now see these\r\nthings as they are.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The capitalist class! The working class! The class struggle!_ These are\r\nthe supreme economic and political facts of this day and the precise\r\nterms that express them.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThese are the grim realities in the existing capitalist system, and the\r\nsooner you drop your brotherhood toys and deal with the labor question,\r\nto which most of you are strangers, the better will it be for you.\r\n\r\nWhat is the labor question?\r\n\r\nIt is the question of the working class organizing to overthrow the\r\ncapitalist class, emancipating itself from wage slavery and making\r\nitself the ruling class of the world.\r\n\r\nCan this be done?\r\n\r\nAnything can be done by the working class.\r\n\r\nLabor has but to awaken to its own power. Then the earth and all its\r\nfullness will be for labor. Now the exploiters of labor have it; and\r\nthey must be put out of that business and into useful service.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, you railroad workers, you million and almost a half of\r\nslaves, must wake up; realize that you are a part of the working class\r\nand that the whole working class must unite, close up the ranks and\r\npresent a solid front, every day in the year, election day especially\r\nincluded.\r\n\r\nAs individual wage-slaves you are helpless and your condition hopeless.\r\nAs a _class_, you are the greatest power between the earth and the\r\nstars. As a _class_, your chains turn to spider-webs and in your\r\npresence capitalists shrivel up and blow away.\r\n\r\nThe individual wage-slave must recognize the power of class unity and do\r\nall he can to bring it about.\r\n\r\nThat is what is called _class-consciousness_, in the light of which may\r\nbe seen the _class struggle_ in startling vividness.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe class-conscious worker recognizes the necessity of organization,\r\neconomic and political, and of using every weapon at his command—the\r\nstrike, the boycott, the ballot and every other—to achieve his\r\nemancipation.\r\n\r\nHe, therefore, joins the union of his _class_ and the party of his\r\n_class_ and gives his time and energy to the work of educating and\r\nlining up his _class_ for the struggle of his _class_ for emancipation.\r\n\r\nYou railroad men may think you are doing this now, but you are not. You\r\nare wasting most of your time and money for that which will bring no\r\nreturns.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLet me tell you a few things the railroad corporations and your leaders,\r\nbetween whom there is an “identity of interests,” are having you do to\r\noccupy your time and keep you chained to the kennels of your masters.\r\n\r\n_First_—They have you divided into petty groups, each trying to be it,\r\nand not one having any real power for working class good.\r\n\r\n_Second_—They have you quarreling about jurisdiction and about an “open\r\ndoor,” and the corporations smile serenely while you play with these\r\ntoys.\r\n\r\nYour jurisdiction squabbles never will be settled, but grow worse. At\r\nplaces the B. L. E. and B. L. F. are at swords’ points, and the O. R. C.\r\nand B. R. T. are ready to fly at each others’ throats; and so intense is\r\nthe petty craft jealousy that they are ready to scab on one another.\r\n\r\nAnd if they ever go out on strike, particularly the B. L. E., their own\r\nformer members, victimized by them, will rise up to smite them.\r\n\r\nThe other day I met a man who had an official position that paid him\r\n$5,000.00 a year. Said he to me: “I will quit this job for but one\r\nthing, and that will be to take an engine when the B. L. E. go out on\r\nstrike.” He used to be a member.\r\n\r\nThere are any number of men scattered over the country—most of them its\r\nown former members—waiting for the B. L. E. to strike, and the day is\r\nnot distant when that union will reap the harvest it has sown.\r\n\r\n_Third_—You are kept apart from other workers, for it would be dangerous\r\nif you affiliated with them and got an idea above the round-house or\r\ncaboose or cab you work in. Besides, you might get class-conscious and\r\nthat would endanger your slavery.\r\n\r\n_Fourth_—You spend hours in the lodge room, “riding the goat,” getting\r\nthe secret work “down fine,” giving “passwords” and “signs,” and\r\nunpacking job-lots of “secret work” that any railroad official in the\r\ncountry can have any day he wants it.\r\n\r\nThese are but bibs and rattles for mental babies, and the more time you\r\namuse yourselves with them the less danger there is of your thinking\r\nabout anything that will break your chains and set you free.\r\n\r\nThese are a few of the things; I have not space for more. The hundreds\r\nof columns of stale stuff rehashed for years in your journals that might\r\nbe called goose gossip would, perhaps, be excusable in the official\r\norgan of some feeble-minded asylum, but it is woefully out of place in a\r\nworking class publication.\r\n\r\nNow let me say a few more things—and space will allow only a few of the\r\nmany that might be put down—that you may think about at your leisure.\r\n\r\nThe Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers is forty-two years old and has\r\nnever won a strike of any consequence in all its career.\r\n\r\nIt is called a success because the corporations make some concessions to\r\nit so as to use it as a battering ram against other employes in the\r\nservice; and this is substantially true of all the “brotherhoods.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThen, again, the brotherhoods are used against each other.\r\n\r\nThe union switchmen on the Denver and Rio Grande, at Pittsburg and other\r\nplaces; the engineers on the C., B. & Q.; the telegraph operators on the\r\nA. & P., M., K. & T., Great Northern and Northern Pacific; and the\r\nmachinists on the Santa Fe are but a few of the long list of victims of\r\nthe “dog-eat-dog” unionism, a quarter of a century behind the times.\r\n\r\nBut the grand officers of the several unions attend one another’s\r\nconventions and join in solemn chorus in telling the delegates of each\r\nother’s union what wise grand officers they have, how kind the\r\ncorporations are to them, and how proud they ought to be of their noble\r\nbrotherhoods.\r\n\r\nIn the next few years locomotive engineers will become motormen and\r\nfiremen will disappear. It is safe to say that in another twenty years\r\nlocomotive firemen will be practically of the past. They can then cling\r\nto their last straw—their insurance policy—and that is the main thing\r\nthat holds them together today. But for that they would soon cave in,\r\nand that is true of them all. They are then, primarily, coffin clubs and\r\nnot labor unions. They care for the sick and bury the dead—a good thing,\r\nincidentally, for the corporations. To get the full benefits, it is\r\nnecessary to be maimed or killed.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is well to bury the dead, but the living are infinitely more\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\nOne effective blow to break the chains of wage slavery is better than a\r\ncentury of attention to dead bodies.\r\n\r\nClass-consciousness is better than corpse-consciousness.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA good deal more that should be said must be omitted for the want of\r\ntime and space.\r\n\r\nIt is my hope that the facts here presented may lead the railroad\r\nworkers to study the real labor question. A few of them only know what\r\nSocialism is, and they are Socialists. The rest are opposed to it\r\nbecause the little they know about it is not true.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNo honest workingman understands Socialism without embracing it.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe railroad workers, if they want their eyes opened, must read class\r\nstruggle literature.\r\n\r\nThe Appeal to Reason, with a circulation of over three hundred thousand\r\ncopies, can be obtained for a trifle—fifty cents for a whole year—and if\r\nthey can’t afford that, they can send ten cents for a trial\r\nsubscription.\r\n\r\nThey cannot afford to remain in ignorance of the class struggle, or of\r\nwhat Socialism really means.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA mighty social revolution is impending—it is shaking the earth from\r\ncenter to circumference, and only the dead may be deaf to its rumblings.\r\n\r\nRevolutionary education and organization is the vital need of the\r\nworking class.\r\n\r\nLet every railroad employe who is alive enough to want to know how the\r\nworking class can emancipate the working class and walk the earth free,\r\nand enjoy all its manifold blessings, subscribe for a revolutionary\r\npaper and read it for a year; and he will then find himself with the\r\nrest of us, in class-conscious array, in the struggle for freedom.\r\n\r\nThe Appeal to Reason, already suggested, will make an excellent\r\nbeginning. There is a long list of other papers and magazines that can\r\nbe read with profit.\r\n\r\nDrop a card to J. Mahlon Barnes, National Secretary Socialist party, 180\r\nE. Washington street, Chicago, asking him to send you printed matter in\r\nregard to this working class party, and also to send you a list of\r\nSocialist papers and magazines, and a catalog of working class books and\r\npamphlets.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGreat is the privilege we enjoy in being permitted to take part in this\r\nmighty historic struggle.\r\n\r\nThe base and cowardly will sneer and sneak to the rear, but the brave\r\nand true, though hell itself gape, will do battle with all the blood in\r\ntheir veins, and write their names in living letters on the shining\r\nscroll of LABOR’S EMANCIPATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        The Growth of Socialism\r\n\r\n                     _Written for Success Magazine_\r\n\r\n _The article being reduced and some vital passages omitted, on account\r\n  of space limitations, it was reproduced in its complete form in the\r\n                   Appeal to Reason, March 17, 1906._\r\n\r\nNot many of those schooled in old-party politics have any adequate\r\nconception of the true import of the labor movement. They read of it in\r\nthe papers, discuss it in their clubs, criticise labor unions, condemn\r\nwalking delegates, and finally conclude that organized labor is a thing\r\nto be tolerated so long, only, as it keeps within “proper bounds,” but\r\nto be put down summarily the moment its members, like the remnants of\r\nIndian tribes on the western plains, venture beyond the limits of their\r\nreservations. They utterly fail or refuse to see the connection between\r\nlabor and politics, and are, therefore, woefully ignorant of the\r\npolitical significance of the labor movement of the present day.\r\n\r\nIt is true that in all the centuries of the past labor has been “put\r\ndown” when it has sought some modicum of its own, or when it has even\r\nyearned for some slight amelioration of its wretched condition, as\r\nwitness the merciless massacre of the half-famished and despairing\r\nsubjects of the Russian czar, a few months ago, for daring to hope that\r\ntheir humble petition for a few paltry concessions might be received and\r\nconsidered by his mailed and heartless majesty.\r\n\r\nIt is likewise true, that, in the present day, and in the United States,\r\nall the powers of government stand ready to “put down” the working class\r\nwhenever it may be deemed necessary in the interest of its industrial\r\nmasters.\r\n\r\nAll great strikes prove that the government is under the control of\r\ncorporate capital and that the army of office-holders is as subservient\r\nto the capitalist masters as is the army of wage-workers that depends\r\nupon them for employment.\r\n\r\nBut, true as these things are, it is not true that labor is ignorant of\r\nthem, nor is it true that such conditions will continue forever.\r\n\r\nThe labor movement has advanced with rapid strides, during the last few\r\nyears, and is, today, the most formidable factor in quickening the\r\nsocial conscience and in regenerating the human race. It is not the\r\nmillions that are enrolled as members of labor unions that give power\r\nand promise to this world movement, but the thousands, rather, that are\r\nnot trade-unionists merely, but working class unionists as well; that is\r\nto say, working men and women who recognize the identity of the\r\nindustrial and political interests of the whole working class; or, in\r\nother words, are conscious of their class interests and are bending all\r\nthe powers of their minds and bodies, spurred by the zeal that springs\r\nfrom comradeship in a common cause, to effect the economic and political\r\nsolidarity of the whole mass of labor, irrespective of race, creed or\r\nsex.\r\n\r\nThese class-conscious workers—these Socialists—realize the fact that the\r\nlabor question, in its full and vital sense, is also a political\r\nquestion, and that the working class must be taught to extend the\r\nprinciple of unionism to the political field, and there organize on the\r\nbasis of their economic class interests; and, although they are engaged\r\nin a herculean task, the forces of industrial evolution and social\r\nprogress are back of them, and all the powers of reaction cannot prevail\r\nagainst them.\r\n\r\nThe labor movement has had to fight its way, inch by inch, from its\r\ninception to its present position, and to this very fact is due the\r\nrevolutionary spirit, indomitable will, and unconquerable fiber it has\r\ndeveloped, and which alone fit it for its mighty historic mission.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning the workers organized in their respective trades simply\r\nto improve working conditions. They had no thought of united political\r\naction. The employing class at once combined to defeat every attempt at\r\norganization on the part of its employes; but, notwithstanding this\r\nopposition, the trade union, which had become an economic necessity,\r\ngrew steadily until at last the employers were compelled to recognize\r\nand deal with it. Being unable to destroy it, they next proceeded to\r\ncontrol its operations by confining it to its narrowest possible\r\nlimitations, thus reducing it to inefficiency—from a menace to a\r\nconvenience.\r\n\r\nThe late Marcus A. Hanna crushed the trade union with an iron boot in\r\nthe beginning of his career as a capitalist. In his maturer years he\r\nbecame its patron saint. He did not change in spirit, but in wisdom.\r\nWhat is true of Mr. Hanna is true of the principal members of the Civic\r\nFederation, that economic peace congress conceived by far-sighted\r\ncapitalists, sanctified by plutocratic prelates, and presided over by a\r\ngentleman who, but a few months ago, engaged James Farley and his army\r\nof five thousand professional strike-breakers to defeat the demands and\r\ndestroy the unions of his New York subway employes.\r\n\r\nA new unionism has struggled into existence, and the coming year will\r\nwitness some tremendous changes. The old forms cramp and fetter the new\r\nforces. As these new forces develop, the old forms must yield and\r\nfinally give way to transformation.\r\n\r\nThe old unionism, under the inspiration of a Civic Federation banquet,\r\nexclaims jubilantly: “The interests of labor and capital are identical.\r\nHallelujah!”\r\n\r\nTo this stimulating sentiment the whole body of exploiting capitalists\r\ngive hearty assent; all its politicians, parsons, and writers join in\r\nenthusiastic approval; and woe be to the few clear, calm, and candid\r\nprotestants who deny it. Their very loyalty becomes treason, and the\r\nworking class they seek to serve is warned against them, while the false\r\nleaders are loaded with fulsome adulation.\r\n\r\nBut, nevertheless, the clear voice of the awakened and dauntless few\r\ncannot be silenced. The new unionism is being heard. In trumpet tones it\r\nrings out its revolutionary shibboleth to all the workers of the earth:\r\nOur interests are identical—let us combine, industrially and\r\npolitically, assert our united power, achieve our freedom, enjoy the\r\nfruit of our labor, rid society of parasitism, abolish poverty, and\r\ncivilize the world!\r\n\r\nThe old unionism, living in the dead past, still affirms that the\r\ninterests of labor and capital are identical.\r\n\r\nThe new unionism, vitalized and clarified by the living present,\r\nexclaims: We know better; capitalists and wageworkers have antagonistic\r\neconomic interests; capitalists buy and workers sell labor power, the\r\none as cheaply and the other as dearly as possible; they are locked in a\r\nlife-and-death class-struggle; there can be no identity of interests\r\nbetween masters and slaves—between exploiters and exploited—and there\r\ncan be no peace until the working class is triumphant in this struggle\r\nand the wage system is forever wiped from the earth.\r\n\r\nThe months immediately before us will witness a mighty mustering of the\r\nworking class, on the basis of the class struggle, and the day is not\r\nfar distant when they will be united in one vast economic organization\r\nin which all the trades will be represented, “separate as the waves, yet\r\none as the sea,” and one great political party that stands\r\nuncompromisingly for the working class and its program of human\r\nemancipation.\r\n\r\nIn the late national election, for the first time, the hand of the\r\nworking class was clearly seen.\r\n\r\nThe Socialist party is distinctively the party, and its vote is\r\ndistinctively the vote, of the working class.\r\n\r\nMore than four hundred thousand of these votes were counted; probably\r\ntwice as many were cast. This was but the beginning. From now on there\r\nis “a new Richmond in the field.”\r\n\r\nThere is but one issue from the standpoint of labor, and that is: Labor\r\nversus Capital. Upon that basis the political alignment of the future\r\nwill have to be made. There is no escape from it.\r\n\r\nFor the present the ignorance of the workers stands in the way of their\r\neconomic and political solidarity, but this can and will be overcome. In\r\nthe meantime, the small capitalists and the middle class are being\r\nground to atoms in the mill of competition. Thousands are being driven\r\nfrom the field entirely, beaten in the struggle, bankrupt and hopeless,\r\nto be swallowed up in the surging sea of wage-slavery; while thousands\r\nof others cling to the outer edge, straining every nerve to stem the\r\ntorrent that threatens to sweep them into the abyss, their condition so\r\nprecarious that they anticipate the inevitable and make common issue\r\nwith the wage-workers in the struggle to overthrow the capitalist system\r\nand reconstruct society upon a new foundation of co-operative industry\r\nand the social ownership of the means of life.\r\n\r\nOf all the silly sayings of the self-satisfied of the present day, the\r\noft-repeated falsehood that there are “no classes” in this country takes\r\nthe lead, and is often made to serve as the prelude to the preposterous\r\nwarning that periodically peals from rich and sumptuous club banquets,\r\nat which the president and other patriots are guests, that “it is\r\ntreason to array class against class in the United States.”\r\n\r\nIf there are no classes, how can they be arrayed against each other?\r\n\r\nThe fact is that precisely the same classes and conditions that exist in\r\nthe monarchies of the old world have also developed in our capitalist\r\nrepublic. The working class sections, including the tenements and slums\r\nof New York and London, are strikingly similar; and the wealth-owning\r\nclass of the United States represents as distinct an aristocracy as\r\nEngland can boast, while the laboring elements of both countries are\r\ndistinctively in the “lower class” by themselves and practically on the\r\nsame degraded level.\r\n\r\nDeny it as may the retainers of the rich, the classes already exist;\r\nthey are here, and no amount of sophistication can remove them, nor the\r\nchasm that divides them. The rare and exceptional wage-worker who\r\nescapes from wage-slavery simply proves the rule and emphasizes the doom\r\nof his class in capitalist society.\r\n\r\nThe existing classes and the struggle going on between them are not due\r\nto the mischievous influence of labor agitators, as certain politicians\r\nand priests, the emissaries of the “rich and respectable,” would have it\r\nappear.\r\n\r\nThe long swell of the wave but expresses the agitation of the deep.\r\n\r\nThe agitator is the product of unrest—his is the voice of the social\r\ndeep; and, though he may be reviled as a demagogue who preys upon the\r\nignorance of his fellows, the unrest continues and the agitation\r\nincreases until the cause of it is removed and justice is done.\r\n\r\nClasses and class rule and their attendant progress and poverty, money\r\nand misery, turmoil and strife, are inherent in the capitalist system.\r\nWhy? Simply because one set of men owns the tools with which wealth is\r\nproduced, while another set uses them, and there is an irrepressible\r\nconflict over the division of the product.\r\n\r\nThe capitalist owns the tools he does not use; the worker uses the tools\r\nhe does not own.\r\n\r\nThe principal tools of production and distribution in the United\r\nStates—mammoth machines, complex social instruments, made and used\r\nco-operatively by millions of workingmen, their very lives, their wives\r\nand babes being dependent upon them—are the private property of a few\r\nhundred capitalists, and are operated purely to make profits for these\r\ncapitalists, regardless of the poverty and wretchedness that ensue to\r\nthe masses.\r\n\r\nIn virtue of the individual ownership of the social instruments of\r\nproduction, one capitalist may exploit the labor of a million workingmen\r\nand become a billionaire, while the million workers struggle through\r\nlife in penury and want, to a bleak and barren old age, to find rest at\r\nlast in the pauper asylum, the morgue and the potter’s field.\r\n\r\nThis vast and resourceful country should be free from the scourge of\r\npoverty and the blight of ignorance; but it never will be until the\r\nprivate ownership of the means of sustaining life is abolished and\r\nsociety is organized on the basis of social ownership of the social\r\nmeans of wealth production and the inalienable right of all to work and\r\nto produce freely to satisfy their physical needs and material wants. It\r\nis for this great organic change, this world-wide social revolution,\r\nthat the Socialists of all countries are organizing, that it may be\r\nintelligently guided, and come, if possible, in peace and order when the\r\npeople and conditions have been prepared for it.\r\n\r\nThe present order of society is developing all the symptoms of\r\ndegeneracy and dissolution. Only the individualist self-seekers and\r\ntheir mercenaries—they who believe in making the animal struggle for\r\nexistence perpetual, in climbing to the top over the corpses of their\r\nfellows—only they are satisfied, or would appear to be, and expatiate\r\nupon our marvelous prosperity, and the incomparable glory of our “free\r\ninstitutions.”\r\n\r\nThe man who can look upon New York or Chicago, today, and utter such\r\nsentiments should blush for his perverted sense of justice, to say\r\nnothing of his total lack of humanity.\r\n\r\nMany thousands of men, women and children suffer for food and shiver in\r\nthe cold in these typical capitalist cities, while the beef trust is\r\ncrammed to bursting and the cotton kings of the South burn cotton to\r\nkeep up prices.\r\n\r\nHas the world ever heard of such monstrous iniquity—such unspeakable\r\ncrime? In the name of all that has heart in it not yet turned to\r\nadamant, has human life any value, even that of the lowest grade of\r\nmerchandise? And is it not high time to call a halt to the ravages of\r\ncapitalism and give a little thought and consideration to humanity?\r\n\r\nLet us briefly note some of the crying evils which infest the\r\nclass-ruled society of the present day. First of all, millions are\r\npoverty-stricken, the result, mainly, of no work or low wages. The great\r\nbook of Robert Hunter, on “Poverty,” recently published, abounds in\r\nfacts, supported by incontrovertible proofs, which silence all doubt\r\nupon this point.\r\n\r\nIn New York City, alone, fifty thousand children, when they go to school\r\nat all, go without sufficient and proper food, and one corpse in every\r\nten is dumped into the potter’s field.\r\n\r\nNew York and Chicago are filled with unemployed and suffering, and in\r\nthe country at large ten millions are in want. In the shoemaking\r\nindustry, fifty-one per cent of the laborers receive less than three\r\nhundred dollars per year. In cotton spinning, the wages of thousands\r\naverage from two hundred and twenty dollars to four hundred and sixty\r\ndollars per year. During the last year tens of thousands of coal miners\r\nwere allowed to work but from one to three days per week. Fall River\r\ncapitalists reduce wages three times in rapid succession, and lock out\r\nand starve their employes for six months, declaring that they cannot\r\nafford to pay the high price’s for cotton, while the planters of the\r\nSouth burn up the cotton to keep up prices rather than clothe the naked\r\nwhose labor produced it.\r\n\r\nThe state of Colorado seethes with military brutality and reeks with\r\npolitical corruption because the mine owners are practically proprietors\r\nof the state and propose to do as they please with their own; and they\r\nwho have the temerity to protest are branded outlaws and bull-penned,\r\ndeported, or shot dead in their tracks.\r\n\r\nThe United States senate is dominated by the special representatives of\r\nthe trusts and corporations, and several of its members are under\r\nindictment for playing the game of their masters in their own personal\r\ninterests. Think of Senator Chauncey M. Depew reforming the abuses of\r\nthe railroads, or Thomas C. Platt stopping the extortion of the express\r\ncompanies, in the interest of the people!\r\n\r\nThe Pennsylvania Railroad company dictated the recent election of the\r\nUnited States senator from Pennsylvania, and the most flagitious\r\npolitical debauchery attended the election of many others, such\r\nproceedings being regarded as so entirely in consonance with our\r\ncapitalist-owned republic as to excite little more than passing notice.\r\n\r\nOnly a short time ago the late John H. Reagan, the venerable ex-senator\r\nof Texas, in discussing the federal courts, said that he expected no\r\nimprovement in them “as long as railroad lawyers are allowed to go on\r\nthe bench to interpret legislation affecting the management of the\r\nrailroads.” As long as the railroads are privately owned they will have\r\ntheir judges on the bench, and the government, that is to say, the\r\ncapitalist politicians, will do their bidding.\r\n\r\nJudge Reagan closed his sweeping arraignment of the courts as follows:\r\n“I have seen such gross perversions of the law by the courts that I have\r\nlost confidence in them and regret that I cannot feel the respect for\r\nthem that I once felt.”\r\n\r\nThese are ominous words and from a source that gives them the weight of\r\nhigh authority.\r\n\r\nCensus figures recently published show that “every fifth child between\r\nthe ages of ten and fifteen in the United States is a breadwinner. One\r\nout of every three of these children workers is a girl. There are one\r\nmillion seven hundred and fifty thousand one hundred and seventy-eight\r\nchildren employed, an increase of thirty-three and one-third per cent in\r\nten years.”\r\n\r\nThe land frauds, postal steals, and Indian graft all cry out in\r\ncondemnation of private ownership of capital, the source and inspiration\r\nof all the political corruption that, like a pestilence, blights the\r\nland.\r\n\r\nCharles F. Kelly, speaker of the house of delegates, at St. Louis, the\r\nconvicted boodler, in making his confession, described in a few graphic\r\nwords the methods and motives of office-holders and politicians in the\r\ngrab-all regime of profitocracy. Said he: “Our combine was not along\r\nparty lines. Both democrats and republicans belonged to it. My\r\nexperience has been that boodlers line up according to their own\r\ninterests, and not under party standards. In the majority of the wards\r\nof St. Louis both the democratic party and the republican usually\r\nnominate men to go to the house of delegates for the money they can get\r\nout of it. Each party man votes for his own fellows, and either one that\r\ngets in serves those who rob the city of franchises.”\r\n\r\nBe it noted that the corrupters of courts, the bribers of legislators,\r\nand the debauchers of public morals are all capitalists in high\r\nstanding, the gentry whose subservient and hypocritical underlings are\r\nforever preaching about “law and order” to the working class.\r\n\r\nIn the face of these frightful eruptions on the body-politic, President\r\nRoosevelt coolly informs us that we are passing through a period of\r\n“noteworthy prosperity,” and that “we must raise still higher our\r\nstandard of commercial ethics, and we must insist more and more upon\r\nthose fundamental principles of our country—equality before the law and\r\nobedience to the law. _In no other way can the advance of Socialism,\r\nwhether evolutionary or revolutionary, be checked._”\r\n\r\nThe words “still higher” seem like sarcasm when applied to our so-called\r\n“standard of commercial ethics,” that is mired in profit-mongering and\r\ncan never rise above the sordid level of brutal self-interest in the\r\ndeclining stages of the competitive system.\r\n\r\nThe commercial pirates who rob the nation of its franchises and organize\r\nmonopolies to exploit the people are not in the business of raising the\r\nstandards of ethics, commercial or otherwise. The only ethics they know\r\nis to “get there”; the end always justifying the means.\r\n\r\nJust at present President Roosevelt, typical capitalist executive that\r\nhe is, is after the railroads—so we are told. His organs assure us that\r\nhe proposes to bring these great corporations to their knees, and make\r\nthem obey the law and stop robbing the people. And yet President\r\nRoosevelt has had one of these criminal offenders in his own cabinet.\r\n\r\nIt is known of all men that Paul Morton, late secretary of the navy, is\r\na self-confessed lawbreaker, who would now be serving a prison sentence\r\nif the law in his case had been enforced.\r\n\r\nThen, again, can President Roosevelt consistently crack the whip above\r\nthe heads of these corporations after sharing in the special privileges\r\nthey enjoy at the expense of the people? In making his political\r\ncampaigns, and on other occasions since he has become a commanding\r\nfigure in national politics, the railroad corporations have provided Mr.\r\nRoosevelt with the most luxurious special trains, sumptuously furnished\r\nand abundantly stocked, _free of charge_. The thousands of dollars of\r\nexpense thus incurred by the railroad corporations could not have been\r\nwithout some consideration, and, whatever that may be, it is not\r\ncalculated to inspire self-respecting and candid men who think for\r\nthemselves with faith in the sincerity of the president when he vaults\r\ninto the arena to do battle against the railroads as the champion of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nIt is not to reform the evils of the day but to abolish the social\r\nsystem that produces them that the Socialist party is organized. It is\r\nthe party not of reform but of revolution, knowing that the capitalist\r\nsystem has had its day and that a new social order, based upon a new\r\nsystem of industry, must soon supplant the fast decaying one we now\r\nhave.\r\n\r\nEvery social system changes ceaselessly, and, ultimately, having\r\nfulfilled its mission, passes away.\r\n\r\nCapitalism is the connecting link between feudalism and Socialism.\r\n\r\nThe industrial forces are now making for Socialism, preparing the way\r\nfor it, and sooner or later it is sure to come.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand the capitalist class are combining their resources,\r\ncentralizing their capital, co-operating instead of competing,\r\norganizing industry, and eliminating competition. This is the new and\r\nbetter way. It is good as far as it goes. It is the limited application\r\nof the economic principles of Socialism.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the working class are organizing. They are beginning\r\nto spell solidarity and to pronounce Socialism. They are yearning for\r\nemancipation from the galling yoke of wage-slavery, and with all the\r\npower of their minds, all the strength of their bodies and all the\r\npassion of their souls they are crusading against the ignorance of their\r\nfellow-workers and the prejudice of the people.\r\n\r\nSteadily the number of class-conscious toilers is increasing, and higher\r\nand higher rises the tide that is to sweep away the barriers to progress\r\nand civilization.\r\n\r\nLet others talk about the tariff and finance—the enlightened workers\r\ndemand the ownership of the tools of industry and they are building up\r\nthe Socialist party as a means of getting them.\r\n\r\n_The working class alone made the tools; the working class alone can use\r\nthem, and the working class must, therefore, own them._\r\n\r\nThis is the revolutionary demand of the Socialist movement. The\r\npropaganda is one of education and is perfectly orderly and peaceable.\r\nThe workers must be taught to unite and vote together _as a class_ in\r\nsupport of the Socialist party, the party that represents them as a\r\nclass, and when they do this the government will pass into their hands\r\nand capitalism will fall to rise no more; private ownership will give\r\nway to social ownership, and production for profit to production for\r\nuse; the wagesystem will disappear, and with it the ignorance and\r\npoverty, misery and crime that wage-slavery breeds; the working class\r\nwill stand forth triumphant and free, and a new era will dawn in human\r\nprogress and in the civilization of mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          An Ideal Labor Press\r\n\r\n                     _The Metal Worker, May, 1904_\r\n\r\nThe prime consideration in the present industrial system is profit. All\r\nother things are secondary. Profit is the life blood of capital—the\r\nvital current of the capitalist system, and when it shall cease to flow\r\nthe system will be dead.\r\n\r\nThe capitalist is the owner of the worker’s tools. Before the latter can\r\nwork he must have access to the capitalist’s toolhouse and permission to\r\nuse the master’s tools. What he produces with these tools belongs to the\r\nmaster, to whom he must sell his labor power at the market price. The\r\nowner of the tools is therefore master of the man.\r\n\r\nOnly when the capitalist can exact a satisfactory profit from his labor\r\npower is the worker given a job, or allowed to work at all.\r\n\r\nProfit first; labor, life, love, liberty—all these must take second\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nIn such a system labor is in chains, and the standard of living, if such\r\nit may be called, is corner-stoned in crusts and rags.\r\n\r\nUnder such conditions ideas and ideals are not prolific among the sons\r\nand daughters of toil.\r\n\r\nSlavery does not excite lofty aspirations nor inspire noble ideals.\r\n\r\nThe tendency is to sodden irresolution and brutish inertia.\r\n\r\nBut this very tendency nourishes the germ of resistance that ripens into\r\nthe spirit of revolt.\r\n\r\nThe labor movement is the child of slavery—the offspring of\r\noppression—in revolt against the misery and suffering that gave it\r\nbirth.\r\n\r\nIts splendid growth is the marvel of our time, the forerunner of\r\nfreedom, the hope of mankind.\r\n\r\nTen thousand times has the labor movement stumbled and fallen and\r\nbruised itself, and risen again; been seized by the throat and choked\r\nand clubbed into insensibility; enjoined by courts, assaulted by thugs,\r\ncharged by the militia, shot down by regulars, traduced by the press,\r\nfrowned upon by public opinion, deceived by politicians, threatened by\r\npriests, repudiated by renegades, preyed upon by grafters, infested by\r\nspies, deserted by cowards, betrayed by traitors, bled by leeches, and\r\nsold out by leaders, but, notwithstanding all this, and all these, it is\r\ntoday the most vital and potential power this planet has ever known, and\r\nits historic mission of emancipating the workers of the world from the\r\nthraldom of the ages is as certain of ultimate realization as the\r\nsetting of the sun.\r\n\r\nThe most vital thing about this world movement is its educational\r\npropaganda—its capacity and power to shed light in the brain of the\r\nworking class, arouse them from their torpor, develop their faculties\r\nfor thinking, teach them their economic class interests, effect their\r\nsolidarity, and imbue them with the spirit of the impending social\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\nIn this propaganda the life-breath of the movement, the press, is\r\nparamount to all other agencies and influences, and the progress of the\r\npress is a sure index of the progress of the movement.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the workers lack intelligent appreciation of the\r\nimportance of the press; they also lack judgment and discrimination in\r\ndealing with the subject, and utterly neglect some good papers, and\r\npermit them to perish, while others that are anything but helpful or\r\nbeneficial to the cause they are supposed to represent are liberally\r\npatronized and flourish in the ignorance and stupidity which support\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe material prosperity of a labor paper of today is no guarantee of its\r\nmoral or intellectual value. Indeed, some of the most worthless labor\r\npublications have the finest mechanical appearance, and are supported by\r\nthe largest circulations.\r\n\r\nSuch a press is not only not a help to labor but a millstone about its\r\nneck, that only the awakening intelligence of the working class can\r\nremove.\r\n\r\nHow thoroughly alive the capitalists are to the power of the press! And\r\nhow assiduously they develop and support it that it may in turn buttress\r\ntheir class interests!\r\n\r\nThe press is one of their most valuable assets, and, as an investment,\r\npays the highest dividends.\r\n\r\nWhen there is trouble between capital and labor the press volleys and\r\nthunders against labor and its unions and leaders and all other things\r\nthat dare to breathe against the sacred rights of capital. In such a\r\ncontest labor is dumb, speechless; it has no press that reaches the\r\npublic, and must submit to the vilest calumny, the most outrageous\r\nmisrepresentation.\r\n\r\nThe lesson has been taught in all the languages of labor and written in\r\nthe blood of its countless martyred victims.\r\n\r\nLabor must have a press as formidable as the great movement of the\r\nworking class requires, to worthily represent its dignity and fearlessly\r\nand uncompromisingly advocate its principles.\r\n\r\nEvery member of a trade union should feel himself obligated to do his\r\nfull share in the important work of building up the press of the labor\r\nmovement; he should at least support the paper of his union, and one or\r\nmore of the papers of his party, and, above all, he should read them and\r\nschool himself in the art of intelligent criticism, and let the editor\r\nhear from him when he has a criticism to offer or a suggestion to make.\r\n\r\nThe expense of supporting the labor press is but a trifle to the\r\nindividual member—less than the daily outlay for other trifles that are\r\nof no benefit, and can easily be dispensed with.\r\n\r\nThe editor of a labor paper is of far more importance to the union and\r\nthe movement than the president or any other officer of the union. He\r\nought to be chosen with special reference to his knowledge upon the\r\nlabor question and his fitness to advocate and defend the economic\r\ninterests of the class he represents.\r\n\r\nThe vast amount of capitalist advertising some labor publications carry\r\ncertifies unerringly to the worthlessness of their literary contents.\r\nCapitalists do not, as a rule, advertise in labor papers that are loyal\r\nto working class interests. It is only on condition that the advertising\r\ncolors and controls the editorial that the capitalist generously allows\r\nhis patronage to go to the labor paper.\r\n\r\nThe workingman who wants to read a labor paper with the true ring, one\r\nthat ably, honestly and fearlessly speaks for the working class, will\r\nfind it safe to steer clear of those that are loaded with capitalist\r\nadvertising and make his selection from those that are nearly or quite\r\nboycotted by the class that live and thrive upon the slavery and\r\ndegradation of the working class.\r\n\r\nThe labor press of today is not ideal, but it is improving steadily, and\r\nthe time will come when the ideal labor press will be realized; when the\r\nlabor movement will command editors, writers, journalists, artists of\r\nthe first class; when hundreds of papers, including dailies in the large\r\ncities, will gather the news and discuss it from the labor standpoint;\r\nwhen illustrated magazines and periodicals will illuminate the\r\nliterature of labor and all will combine to realize our ideal labor\r\npress and blaze the way to victory.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              [8]Childhood\r\n\r\n                           _Appeal to Reason_\r\n\r\nWhat sweet emotions the recollections of childhood inspires, and how\r\npriceless its treasured memories in our advancing and declining years!\r\n\r\nLaughing eyes and curly hair, little brown hands and bare feet, innocent\r\nand care-free, trusting and loving, tender and pure, what an elevating\r\nand satisfying influence these little gods have upon our maturer years!\r\n\r\nChildhood! What a holy theme! Flowers they are, with souls in them, and\r\nif on this earth man has a sacred charge, a holy obligation, it is to\r\nthese tender buds and blossoms of humanity.\r\n\r\nYet how many of them are prematurely plucked, fade and die and are\r\ntrampled in the mire. Many millions of them have been snatched from the\r\ncradle and stolen from their play to be fed to the forces that turn a\r\nworkingman’s blood into a capitalist’s gold, and many millions of others\r\nhave been crushed and perverted into filth for the slums and food for\r\nthe potter’s field.\r\n\r\nChildhood is at the parting of the ways which lead to success or\r\nfailure, honor or disgrace, life or death. Society is, or ought to be,\r\nprofoundly concerned in the nature of the environment that is to mold\r\nthe character and determine the career of its children, and any\r\nremissness in such duty is rebuked by the most painful of penalties, and\r\nthese are inflicted with increasing severity upon the people of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nChildhood is the most precious charge of the family and the community,\r\nbut our capitalist civilization sacrifices it ruthlessly to gratify its\r\nbrutal lust for pelf and power, and the march of its conquest is stained\r\nwith the blood of infants and paved with the puny bones of children.\r\n\r\nWhat shall the harvest be?\r\n\r\nThe millions of children crushed and slain in the conquest of capitalism\r\nhave not died in vain. From their little martyr graves all over this\r\nfair land their avenging images are springing up, as it were, against\r\nthe system that murdered them and pronouncing upon it, in the name of\r\nGod and humanity, the condemnation of death.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          The Crimson Standard\r\n\r\n                           _Appeal to Reason_\r\n\r\nA vast amount of ignorant prejudice prevails against the red flag. It is\r\neasily accounted for. The ruling class the wide world over hates it, and\r\nits sycophants, therefore, must decry it.\r\n\r\nStrange that the red flag should produce the same effect upon a tyrant\r\nthat it does upon a bull.\r\n\r\nThe bull is enraged at the very sight of the red flag, his huge frame\r\nquivers, his eyes become balls of fire, and he paws the dirt and snorts\r\nwith fury.\r\n\r\nThe reason of this peculiar effect of a bit of red coloring upon the\r\nbovine species we are not particularly interested in at this moment, but\r\nwhy does it happen to excite the same rage in the czar, the emperor and\r\nthe king; the autocrat, the aristocrat and the plutocrat?\r\n\r\nAh, that is simple enough.\r\n\r\nThe red flag, since time immemorial, has symbolized the discontent of\r\nthe downtrodden, the revolt of the rabble.\r\n\r\nThat is its sinister significance to the tyrant and the reason of his\r\nmingled fear and frenzy when the “red rag,” as he characterizes it,\r\ninsults his vision.\r\n\r\nIt is not that he is opposed to red as a color, or even as an emblem,\r\nfor he has it in his own flags and banners, and it never inflames his\r\npassion when it is blended with other colors; but red alone, unmixed and\r\nunadulterated, the pure red that symbolizes the common blood of the\r\nhuman family, the equality of mankind, the brotherhood of the race, is\r\nrepulsive and abhorrent to him because it is at once an impeachment of\r\nhis title, a denial of his superiority and a menace to his power.\r\n\r\nPrecisely for the reason that the plutocrat raves at the red flag the\r\nproletaire should revere it.\r\n\r\nTo the plutocrat it is a peril; to the proletaire a promise.\r\n\r\nThe red flag is an omen of ill, a sign of terror to every tyrant, every\r\nrobber and every vampire that sucks the life of labor and mocks at its\r\nmisery.\r\n\r\nIt is an emblem of hope, a bow of promise to all the oppressed and\r\ndowntrodden of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe red flag is the only race flag; it is the flag of revolt against\r\nrobbery; the flag of the working class, the flag of hope and high\r\nresolve—the flag of Universal Freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Roosevelt’s Labor Letters\r\n\r\n                    _Appeal to Reason, May 18, 1907_\r\n\r\nThe letter of President Roosevelt to the Moyer and Haywood conference of\r\nNew York is in strange contrast with the one previously addressed by him\r\nto the Chicago conference on the same subject. The two letters are so\r\nentirely dissimilar in spirit and temper that they seem to have been\r\nwritten by different persons. In the first the President bristles with\r\ndefiance, in the last he is the pink of politeness.\r\n\r\nThe first letter utterly failed of its purpose. Organized labor did not\r\nlie down and be still at the command of the President. On the contrary,\r\nit growled more fiercely than before; in fact, showed its teeth to the\r\nPresident, who has become so used to exhibiting his own. And lo—what a\r\nchange! The President receives a labor committee, talks over matters for\r\nan hour and then addresses a letter to the conference through the\r\nchairman, beginning “My Dear Mr. Henry,” explaining that he is ready to\r\nperform his duty if only the conference will point it out to him, and\r\nputting the whole blame on “Debs and the Socialists,” whom he charges\r\nwith using “treasonable and murderous language,” but not a word of\r\nexplanation does he vouchsafe in regard to his denunciation of Moyer and\r\nHaywood, the real, and in fact the only, point at issue.\r\n\r\nAgain has the President vindicated his reputation as one of the\r\nsmoothest of politicians and one of the most artful and designing of\r\ndemagogues.\r\n\r\nWe hope the lesson here taught as to what workingmen can accomplish by\r\nthe power of united effort is not lost upon the working class. The first\r\nletter of the President was an insult to labor, and had labor submitted,\r\nthe President’s contempt for it would have been intensified by its\r\ncravenness.\r\n\r\nThe second letter was a virtual apology and nothing less than the firm\r\nattitude of labor extorted it.\r\n\r\nThe President’s position, however, is not less enviable than before.\r\nSince he seeks escape from castigation for his outrageous attack upon\r\nMoyer and Haywood upon the ground that Debs had used “treasonable and\r\nmurderous language” and that it was his duty as President to denounce\r\nit, a few questions will be in order and when the President has answered\r\nthese we have a few more to which answers are also desired.\r\n\r\nDid the President ever hear of one Sherman Bell?\r\n\r\nIs it not a fact that said Sherman Bell is a personal friend of the\r\nPresident and that in a letter written in the President’s own hand he\r\ncommends said Sherman Bell in the most exalted terms?\r\n\r\nHas the President ever heard of the expression, “To hell with habeas\r\ncorpus; we’ll give ’em postmortems,” commended as “patriotic” by the\r\ncapitalist press at the time it was made?\r\n\r\nDoes not the President know that it was his highly esteemed personal\r\nfriend, Sherman Bell, who coined this phrase?\r\n\r\nIs it “treasonable and murderous”?\r\n\r\nDid the President condemn it?\r\n\r\nWill he do so now?\r\n\r\nWould he have done so if it had been Debs instead of Bell?\r\n\r\nWhy does he “conceive it to be his duty” to condemn Debs and not Bell?\r\n\r\nBecause Bell stands for capital and Debs for labor?\r\n\r\nHas Debs ever said anything that, with reference to treason and murder,\r\ncan be compared to this expression of his boon companion, Sherman Bell?\r\n\r\nWill the President please answer?\r\n\r\nAgain, has the President ever heard of one Lieut. T. E. McClelland?\r\n\r\nAnd of the expression, “To hell with the constitution,” made by said\r\nMcClelland?\r\n\r\nIs this treasonable language?\r\n\r\nDid the President condemn it?\r\n\r\nOr, is it patriotic language when used in defense of capital and\r\ntreasonable only when used in defense of labor?\r\n\r\nDoes the President know one Adjutant General Bulkeley Wells, the\r\n“officer of the law” who forcibly seized Moyer, Haywood and Pettibone\r\nand “special-trained” them to Idaho?\r\n\r\nDoes he know that his labor commissioner, Carroll D. Wright, condemns\r\nsaid Bulkeley Wells as a “mob leader” in his official report of the\r\nColorado troubles?\r\n\r\nDoes the President approve mobs?\r\n\r\nAnd consort with mob leaders?\r\n\r\nWhile denouncing mobs?\r\n\r\nHas he denounced Bulkeley Wells?\r\n\r\nWill he do so?\r\n\r\nIs the President aware that the Mine and Smelter Trust, behind the\r\nprosecution of Moyer, Haywood and Pettibone, bought the legislature of\r\nColorado outright, thereby defeating an eight-hour measure which a\r\npopular majority of more than 46,000 votes had commanded said\r\nlegislature to enact into law?\r\n\r\nAnd that those mine and smelter owners are among his personal friends?\r\n\r\nIs there any treason in this?\r\n\r\nHas the President condemned it?\r\n\r\nDare he do so?\r\n\r\nIs this his idea of “exact justice”?\r\n\r\nA “square deal”?\r\n\r\nAgain, is kidnapping according to “law and order”?\r\n\r\nIf the kidnapped are workingmen?\r\n\r\nAnd charged by their kidnappers with being murderers?\r\n\r\nAnd by the President “undesirable citizens”?\r\n\r\nWould the President have taken the same view if workingmen had kidnapped\r\ncapitalists instead of capitalists kidnapping workingmen?\r\n\r\nIf it had been Ryan, Root, and Paul Morton, instead of Moyer, Haywood\r\nand Pettibone?\r\n\r\nWill the President kindly answer?\r\n\r\nHas the President ever heard the expression, “They shall never leave\r\nIdaho alive?”\r\n\r\nIs this “murderous” language?\r\n\r\nExcept when used by “officers of the law”?\r\n\r\nHas the President condemned it?\r\n\r\nDoes he approve it?\r\n\r\nHas the President heard of one W. E. Borah, senator-elect, indicted for\r\ntheft?\r\n\r\nVisiting at the White House and coming out “smiling and confident”?\r\n\r\nIs he innocent and desirable in spite of his indictment and Haywood\r\nguilty and undesirable in spite of the lawful presumption to the\r\ncontrary?\r\n\r\nHas the President ever heard of one Theodore Roosevelt?\r\n\r\nCharged by the New York _Tribune_ and other leading capitalist papers in\r\n1896 with threatening to lead an armed force to Washington to prevent\r\nthe inauguration of a lawfully-elected President of the United States?\r\n\r\nIs there any “treason” or “murder” in this?\r\n\r\nDoes the President remember one John P. Altgeld?\r\n\r\nAnd one Theodore Roosevelt who in the same year of 1896 said that said\r\nAltgeld and one Debs should be lined up against a dead wall and shot?\r\n\r\nWhich said Roosevelt never denied until four years later, when he became\r\ncandidate for Vice President?\r\n\r\nIs this the “temperate” language of a perfectly “desirable” citizen?\r\n\r\nDoes the President remember one Governor Roosevelt, of New York, who\r\nordered his militia to Croton Dam to shoot some of the workingmen who\r\nelected him for venturing to ask the enforcement of the eight-hour law\r\nof that state?\r\n\r\nAnd to protect the contractors who were violating the law?\r\n\r\nIs this more of the President’s “exact justice to all”?\r\n\r\nWill the President kindly explain what he regards as inexact justice?\r\n\r\nOr exact injustice?\r\n\r\nOr injustice of any kind?\r\n\r\nOr if his “exact justice to all” is not buncombe served in stilted\r\nstyle?\r\n\r\nCan the President say or do any wrong?\r\n\r\nWould he admit it if he did?\r\n\r\nHas he ever done so?\r\n\r\nWhen the President rebuked the labor unions for attempting to “influence\r\nthe course of justice” did he not know it was violent kidnapping they\r\nwere protesting against?\r\n\r\nThat they were seeking to influence the course, not of justice, but of\r\ninjustice?\r\n\r\nResisting, not law, but mob violence cloaked as law?\r\n\r\nAt the time the President administered this rebuke had he not himself\r\nread his letter condemning Moyer and Haywood to members of the supreme\r\ncourt when their case was pending in said court?\r\n\r\nWas this not an attempt to “influence the course of justice”?\r\n\r\nWill the President publicly rebuke it?\r\n\r\nWhen Moyer, Haywood and Pettibone, three workingmen, rugged as Patrick\r\nHenry, honest as Abraham Lincoln and brave as John Brown, were brutally\r\nkidnapped and told that they would be killed by the outlaws who\r\nkidnapped them; when two conspiring governors were the instigators of\r\nthe kidnapping and all legal rights denied; when the special train lay\r\nin wait to rush them to their doom while their wives listened in vain\r\nall night long for their returning footsteps; when all law was cloven\r\ndown, all justice denied, all decency defied and all humanity trampled\r\nbeneath the brutal hoofs of might, a monstrous crime was committed, not\r\nagainst Moyer, Haywood and Pettibone merely, but against the working\r\nclass, against the human race, and, by the eternal, that crime, even by\r\nthe grace of Theodore Roosevelt, shall not go unwhipped by justice.\r\n\r\n“Undesirable citizens” they are to the Christless perverts who exploit\r\nlabor to degeneracy and mock its misery; turn the cradle into a coffin\r\nand call it philanthropy, and debauch the nation’s politics and morals\r\nin the name of civilization.\r\n\r\n“Undesirable citizens” though they are, these are the loyal leaders of\r\nthe men who have toiled in the mines and who have been subjected to\r\nevery conceivable outrage; “who have had their homes broken into and who\r\nhave been beaten, bound, robbed, insulted and imprisoned”; who have been\r\nchained to posts in the public highway, deported from their families\r\nunder penalty of death, and bull-penned while their wives and daughters\r\nwere outraged. In the light of all these crimes perpetrated upon these\r\nmen in violation of every law by brutal mobs, led by the President’s own\r\npersonal friends, as the official reports of his own labor commissioner\r\nwill show, without a word of protest from him, it requires sublime\r\naudacity, to put it mildly, for the President to affirm that he stands\r\nfor “exact justice to all” and that he “conceives it to be his duty” to\r\ndenounce “treasonable and murderous” language.\r\n\r\nIf the miners of Colorado had been less patient than beasts of burden\r\nthey would have risen in revolt against the outrages perpetrated upon\r\nthem by their heartless corporate masters.\r\n\r\nWere a mob of workingmen to seize Theodore Roosevelt and chain him to a\r\npost on a public street in Washington in broad daylight, as a mob of his\r\ncapitalist friends seized and chained a workingman in Colorado, or throw\r\nhim into a foul bullpen, without cause or provocation, prod him with\r\nbayonets and outrage his defenseless family while he was a prisoner, as\r\nwas done in scores of well-authenticated cases in both Colorado and\r\nIdaho, would he then be in the mood to listen complacently to\r\nhypocritical homilies upon the “temperate” use of language, the sanctity\r\nof “law and order” and the beauty of “exact justice to all”?\r\n\r\nAnd if he heard of some man who had sufficient decency to denounce the\r\noutrages he and his family had suffered, would he then “conceive it to\r\nbe his duty,” as he tells us, to condemn the language of such a man as\r\n“treasonable and murderous” and the man himself as “inciting bloodshed,”\r\nand therefore an “undesirable citizen”?\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Labor Omnia Vincit\r\n\r\n  _Written for Labor Day Souvenir, Central Labor Union, Boston, Mass.,\r\n                            September, 1895_\r\n\r\nI would hail the day upon which it could be truthfully said, “Labor\r\nconquers everything,” with inexpressible gratification. Such a day would\r\nstand first in Labor’s Millennium, that prophesied era when Christ shall\r\nbegin his reign on the earth to continue a thousand years.\r\n\r\nThe old Latin fathers did a large business in manufacturing maxims, and\r\nthe one I have selected for a caption of this article has been required\r\nto play shibboleth since, like “a thing of beauty and a joy forever,” it\r\ncame forth from its ancient laboratory.\r\n\r\nIt is one of those happy expressions which embodies quite as much fancy\r\nas fact.\r\n\r\nThe time has arrived for thoughtful men identified with labor—by which I\r\nmean the laboring classes—to inquire, what does labor conquer? or what\r\nhas it conquered in all the ages? or what is it now conquering?\r\n\r\nIf by the term conquer is meant that labor, and only labor, removes\r\nobstacles to physical progress—levels down mountains or tunnels\r\nthem—builds railroads and spans rivers and chasms with bridges—hews down\r\nthe forests—digs canals, transforms deserts into gardens of\r\nfruitfulness—plows and sows and reaps, delves in the mines for coal and\r\nall the precious metals—if it is meant that labor builds all the forges\r\nand factories, and all the railroads that girdle the world and all the\r\nships that cleave the waves, and mans them, builds all the cities and\r\nevery monument in all lands—I say if such things are meant when we\r\nvauntingly exclaim, “labor conquers everything,” no one will controvert\r\nthe declaration—no one will demur—with one acclaim the averments will\r\nstand confessed.\r\n\r\nBut with all these grand achievements to the credit of labor, how stands\r\nlabor itself? Having subdued every obstacle to physical progress, what\r\nis its condition? The answer is humiliating beyond the power of\r\nexaggeration and the aphorism, “_Labor Omnia Vincit_,” becomes the most\r\nconspicuous delusion that ever had a votary since time began.\r\n\r\nIt will be well for labor on Labor day to concentrate its vision on the\r\nUnited States of America. The field is sufficiently broad and there are\r\nenough object lessons in full view to engage the attention of the most\r\ncritical, and it will be strange indeed if the inquiry is not made. What\r\nhas labor conquered up to date in the United States? The inquiry is\r\nfruitful of thought. What is the testimony of the labor press of the\r\ncountry, corroborated by statistics which defy contradiction? It is\r\nthis, that the land is cursed with wage slavery—with the condition that\r\nlabor, which, according to the proverb, “conquers everything,” is itself\r\nconquered and lies prostrate and manacled beneath the iron hoofs of a\r\ndespotism as cruel as ever cursed the world.\r\n\r\nTo hew and dig, to build and repair, to toil and starve, is not\r\nconquering in any proper sense of the term. Conquerors are not clothed\r\nin rags. Conquerors do not starve. The homes of conquerors are not huts,\r\ndark and dismal, where wives and children moan like the night winds and\r\nsob like the rain. Conquerors are not clubbed as if they were thieves,\r\nshot down as if they were vagabond dogs, nor imprisoned as if they were\r\nfelons, by the decrees of despots. No! Conquerors rule—their word is\r\nlaw. Labor is not in the condition of a conqueror in the United States.\r\n\r\nGo to the coal mines, go to the New England factories, go to Homestead\r\nand Pullman, go to the sweat shops and railroad shops, go to any place\r\nin all of the broad land where anvils ring, where shuttles fly, where\r\ntoilers earn their bread in the sweat of their faces, and exclaim,\r\n“_Labor Omnia Vincit_,” and you will be laughed to scorn.\r\n\r\nWhy is it that labor does not conquer anything? Why does it not assert\r\nits mighty power? Why does it not rule in congress, in legislatures and\r\nin courts? I answer because it is factionalized, because it will not\r\nunify, because, for some inscrutable reason, it prefers division,\r\nweakness and slavery, rather than unity, strength and victory.\r\n\r\nWill it always be thus unmindful of its power and prerogatives? I do not\r\nthink so. Will it always tamely submit to degradation? I protest that it\r\nwill not. Labor has the ballot. It has redeeming power. I write from\r\nbehind prison bars, the victim of a petty tyrant. My crime was that I\r\nsought to rescue Pullman slaves from the grasp of a monster of greed and\r\nrapacity.\r\n\r\nI think a day is coming when “_Labor Omnia Vincit_” will change\r\nconditions. I hear the slogan of the clans of organized labor. It cheers\r\nme. I believe with the poet that\r\n\r\n        A Labor Day is coming when our starry flag shall wave,\r\n        Above a land where famine no longer digs a grave,\r\n        Where money is not master, nor the workingman a slave—\r\n        For the right is marching on.\r\n\r\n                                                EUGENE V. DEBS.\r\n\r\nMcHenry County Jail, Woodstock, Ill., August 5, 1895.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Open Letter to President Roosevelt\r\n\r\n                   _Toledo Socialist, April 21, 1906_\r\n\r\n _Dear Mr. President:_\r\n\r\nThe address delivered by you yesterday at the cornerstone ceremony at\r\nWashington has been carefully read and among other things I observe the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n“We can no more and no less afford to condone evil in a man of capital\r\nthan evil in a man of no capital. The wealthy man who exults because\r\nthere is a failure of justice in the effort to bring some trust magnate\r\nto an account for his misdeeds is as bad, and no worse than, the\r\nso-called labor leader who clamorously strives to excite a foul class\r\nfeeling on behalf of some other labor leader who is implicated in\r\nmurder.”\r\n\r\nObviously you have reference in this paragraph to the leaders of labor\r\nin Colorado who were recently seized without warrant of law, forcibly\r\ntaken from the state of which they are citizens, and incarcerated in the\r\npenitentiary of another state in which only convicted criminals are\r\nconfined. I know of no other labor leaders to whom these remarks could\r\napply, and it seems equally plain that I am one of the “so-called”\r\nleaders, if not the particular one, who is “striving to excite a foul\r\nclass feeling in their behalf.”\r\n\r\nPermit me to ask you, Mr. President, how you know that these men are\r\nimplicated in murder? Have they been tried and found guilty by due\r\nprocess of law?\r\n\r\nSince when, Mr. President, are men charged with crime presumed and\r\npronounced guilty until they are found innocent?\r\n\r\nIt is true that you do not name these men, but convict them by innuendo.\r\nIs this fair? Is it just? A square deal? Is it not, in fact, Mr.\r\nPresident, cowardly to take such an advantage of your high office to\r\npronounce the guilt of three of your fellow citizens, who have as yet\r\nnot been tried and against whom nothing has been proved?\r\n\r\nThese men, Mr. President, are workingmen; do you know of any capitalists\r\nwho have ever been treated in the same way?\r\n\r\nSuppose a lot of thugs were to seize a number of capitalists at the hour\r\nof midnight, put them in irons, hustle them aboard a special train, rush\r\nthem into another state and throw them into the penitentiary. Would you\r\ntake the same view of the case, coolly pronounce their guilt and proceed\r\nto deliver your homily upon good citizenship, the “square deal,” and law\r\nand order?\r\n\r\nIf instead of Moyer, Haywood and Pettibone it had been Depew, Platt and\r\nPaul Morton—that is to say, if instead of innocent workingmen they had\r\nbeen criminal capitalists—would you have treated them in precisely the\r\nsame manner?\r\n\r\nYou have told us over and over again, Mr. President, that rich and poor\r\nshould be treated alike; that all are entitled to the equal protection\r\nof the law. That is what you say in substance in the paragraph above\r\nquoted. You have repeated this so often that it has become a stale\r\nplatitude. You have also repeatedly stated that profession without\r\npractice is dishonest and hypocritical.\r\n\r\nVery well, Mr. President, we will take you at your word; we will judge\r\nyou by your acts.\r\n\r\nI shall not now address myself to you as a “so-called” labor leader, but\r\nas your fellow-citizen of the United States.\r\n\r\nYou, Mr. President, are the chief executive of the nation. You are the\r\nconservator of the constitution of the United States and you have\r\npublicly sworn to support it.\r\n\r\nThree citizens have been forcibly seized and deported from the state of\r\ntheir residence into another state in flagrant violation of the\r\nconstitution of the United States. These men now languish in prison\r\ncells.\r\n\r\nLet me repeat the charge, Mr. President, without detail. Three citizens\r\nof the republic have been deprived of the protection vouchsafed to them\r\nunder the constitution of the United States. This fact is known of all\r\nmen; denied by none, not even their accusers. There is not a shadow of\r\ndoubt about it. It is a clear-cut case. All the country knows it. You,\r\nMr. President, know it. Now, then what are you going to do about it?\r\n\r\nWill you make your acts square with your words; your practice with your\r\nprofession?\r\n\r\nIt is up to you, Mr. President! You are reputed to have great moral\r\ncourage and you certainly have great power. Under the constitution, the\r\none that has been violated, the one you have sworn to support, you have\r\nthe power to redress the wrong that has been done. Will you do it?\r\n\r\nAll that I am asking is that you shall perform your sworn duty; you are\r\nnot expected to do more, and you cannot do less without violating your\r\noath of office and betraying your official trust.\r\n\r\nIf you do not believe, Mr. President, that the constitution has been\r\nviolated, or, if you have the least doubt about it, please call upon me\r\nto prove it.\r\n\r\nI am not now handling a “muck-rake”; not looking down, but up; up to you\r\nand awaiting your answer.\r\n\r\nYou are perhaps aware, Mr. President, that some of us are accused of\r\nadvocating violence. It is not true. As a matter of fact we are\r\nresisting violence. In your address yesterday you quoted the\r\ncommandment, “Thou shalt not steal!” Let me quote another, “Thou shalt\r\nnot kill.” This is precisely what we are trying to prevent, not lawful\r\npunishment, but coldblooded murder.\r\n\r\nIn treating with Moyer, Haywood and Pettibone, our comrades, every law\r\nand all decency have been trampled under foot. The state in which these\r\nmen have been stripped of their legal rights and treated as felons is\r\nnotoriously in control of corporations whose absolute sway has been\r\nquestioned by these leaders of the working class; and this, and this\r\nalone, constitutes their crime, and for this they have been marked for\r\ncorporate vengeance.\r\n\r\nThese men, Mr. President, are our comrades, our brothers, and we propose\r\nto stand by them and see that justice is done them.\r\n\r\nA fair trial will free and vindicate them as certain as the sun shines.\r\n\r\nKnowing them as we do to be men of pure character, of absolute integrity\r\nand all other things of good report among men, we know that they are\r\nwholly incapable of committing the crime with which they have been\r\ncharged.\r\n\r\nIt is not pretended that they were in the same state at the time the\r\ncrime was committed. Not a shadow of crime rests upon them other than\r\nthe alleged confession of a self-confessed criminal.\r\n\r\nThese are facts, Mr. President, and in view of these facts we would be\r\ncraven indeed if we allowed our brothers to be made the victims of such\r\nan infamous conspiracy without doing all in our power to save them.\r\n\r\nEvery step thus far taken against these men has been in violation of\r\nlaw, and the purpose of the whole proceeding is so apparent that any man\r\nwith eyes can see it.\r\n\r\nIn this connection, Mr. President, when the question of law and order is\r\nraised, I beg of you to remember that we are dealing with corporations\r\nthat have usurped the powers of state governments; that defy the legally\r\nexpressed will of the people, as in Colorado, where a majority of\r\nforty-six thousand votes was overridden and treated with contempt;\r\ncorporations whose crime-inciting shibboleths are: “To hell with the\r\nconstitution”; “To hell with habeas corpus.”\r\n\r\nThese corporations rule the states and we have had evidence enough to\r\nknow how they treat law when it interferes with their predatory program.\r\n\r\nWe are not in favor of violence, but seeking to avoid it. The facts\r\nprove it.\r\n\r\nWe are not objecting to a fair trial, but to a packed jury and a\r\ncorporation court and the consummation of a criminal conspiracy.\r\n\r\n“Thou shalt not kill!” This applies to capitalists as well as\r\nworkingmen.\r\n\r\nIf Moyer, Haywood and Pettibone were capitalists instead of workingmen\r\nwe should still do our utmost to see that they were given a “square\r\ndeal.”\r\n\r\nMurder in any form is abhorrent, but most terribly so when committed\r\nunder the forms and in the names of law and justice.\r\n\r\nWendell Phillips said that John Brown would have had twice as good a\r\nright to hang Governor Wise as Governor Wise had to hang John Brown.\r\n\r\nAll we are asking and insisting upon is that our accused brothers shall\r\nhave the protection of the law, a fair hearing and just verdict, and\r\nupon that issue we are prepared to go before the American people.\r\n\r\n                                         Respectfully yours,\r\n                                                         EUGENE V. DEBS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            December 2, 1859\r\n\r\n                 _Appeal to Reason, November 23, 1907_\r\n\r\nThis is the immortal date upon which John Brown was led to execution.\r\nLouisa M. Alcott on that day christened him “Saint John the Just.” On\r\nthat same day Longfellow wrote: “This will be a great day in our\r\nhistory; the date of a new revolution, quite as much needed as the old\r\none. Even now, as I write, they are leading Old John Brown to execution\r\nin Virginia for attempting to rescue slaves! This is sowing the wind to\r\nreap the whirlwind, which will come soon.”\r\n\r\nHow prophetic these words!\r\n\r\nWithin a month the mutterings of the storm were heard in the land, and\r\nwithin a few months it broke forth in all its fury.\r\n\r\nDecember 2, 1859, had spoken!\r\n\r\nJohn Brown was the spirit incarnate of the Revolution, and his execution\r\nchanged the destiny of the universe.\r\n\r\nThe hated agitator is now the sainted savior, and his name ranks highest\r\namong the immortals.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     The Martyred Apostles of Labor\r\n\r\n                     _The New Time, February, 1898_\r\n\r\nThe century now closing is luminous with great achievements. In every\r\ndepartment of human endeavor marvelous progress has been made. By the\r\nmagic of the machine which sprang from the inventive genius of man,\r\nwealth has been created in fabulous abundance. But, alas, this wealth,\r\ninstead of blessing the race, has been the means of enslaving it. The\r\nfew have come in possession of all, and the many have been reduced to\r\nthe extremity of living by permission.\r\n\r\nA few have had the courage to protest. To silence these so that the\r\ndead-level of slavery could be maintained has been the demand and\r\ncommand of capital-blown power. Press and pulpit responded with\r\nalacrity. All the forces of society were directed against these pioneers\r\nof industrial liberty, these brave defenders of oppressed humanity—and\r\nagainst them the crime of the century has been committed.\r\n\r\nAlbert R. Parsons, August Spies, George Engel, Adolph Fischer, Louis\r\nLingg, Samuel Fielden, Michael Schwab and Oscar Neebe paid the cruel\r\npenalty in prison cell and on the gallows.\r\n\r\nThey were the first martyrs in the cause of industrial freedom, and one\r\nof the supreme duties of our civilization, if indeed we may boast of\r\nhaving been redeemed from savagery, is to rescue their names from\r\ncalumny and do justice to their memory.\r\n\r\nThe crime with which these men were charged was never proven against\r\nthem. The trial which resulted in their conviction was not only a\r\ndisgrace to all judicial procedure but a foul, black, indelible and\r\ndamning stigma upon the nation.\r\n\r\nIt was a trial organized and conducted to convict—a conspiracy to murder\r\ninnocent men, and hence had not one redeeming feature.\r\n\r\nIt was a plot, satanic in all its conception, to wreak vengeance upon\r\ndefenseless men, who, not being found guilty of the crime charged in the\r\nindictment, were found guilty of exercising the inalienable right of\r\nfree speech in the interest of the toiling and groaning masses, and thus\r\nthey became the first martyrs to a cause which, fertilized by their\r\nblood, has grown in strength and sweep and influence from the day they\r\nyielded up their lives and liberty in its defense.\r\n\r\nAs the years go by and the history of that infamous trial is read and\r\nconsidered by men of thought, who are capable of wrenching themselves\r\nfrom the grasp of prejudice and giving reason its rightful supremacy,\r\nthe stronger the conviction becomes that the present generation of\r\nworkingmen should erect an enduring memorial to the men who had the\r\ncourage to denounce and oppose wage-slavery and seek for methods of\r\nemancipation.\r\n\r\nThe vision of the judicially murdered men was prescient. They saw the\r\ndark and hideous shadow of coming events. They spoke words of warning,\r\nnot too soon, not too emphatic, not too trumpet-toned—for even in 1886,\r\nwhen the Haymarket meetings were held, the capitalistic grasp was upon\r\nthe throats of workingmen and its fetters were upon their limbs.\r\n\r\nThere was even then idleness, poverty, squalor, the rattling of skeleton\r\nbones, the sunken eye, the pallor, the living death of famine, the\r\ncrushing and the grinding of the relentless mills of the plutocracy,\r\nwhich more rapidly than the mills of the gods grind their victims to\r\ndust.\r\n\r\nThe men who went to their death upon the verdict of a jury, I have said,\r\nwere judicially murdered—not only because the jury was packed for the\r\nexpress purpose of finding them guilty, not only because the crime for\r\nwhich they suffered was never proven against them, not only because the\r\njudge before whom they were arraigned was unjust and bloodthirsty, but\r\nbecause they had declared in the exercise of free speech that men who\r\nsubjected their fellowmen to conditions often worse than death were\r\nunfit to live.\r\n\r\nIn all lands and in all ages where the victims of injustice have bowed\r\ntheir bodies to the earth, bearing grievous burdens laid upon them by\r\ncruel taskmasters, and have lifted their eyes starward in the hope of\r\nfinding some orb whose light inspired hope, ten million times the\r\nanathema has been uttered and will be uttered until a day shall dawn\r\nupon the world when the emancipation of those who toil is achieved by\r\nthe brave, self-sacrificing few who, like the Chicago martyrs, have the\r\ncourage of crusaders and the spirit of iconoclasts and dare champion the\r\ncause of the oppressed and demand in the name of an avenging God and of\r\nan outraged Humanity that infernalism shall be eliminated from our\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nAnd as the struggle for justice proceeds and the battlefields are\r\ncovered with the slain, as Mother Earth drinks their blood, the stones\r\nare given tongues with which to denounce man’s inhumanity to man—aye, to\r\nwomen and children, whose moanings from hovel and sweatshop, garret and\r\ncellar, arraign our civilization, our religion and our judiciary—whose\r\nwailings and lamentations, hushing to silence every sound the Creator\r\ndesigned to make the world a paradise of harmonies, transform it into an\r\ninferno where the demons of greed plot and scheme to consign their\r\nvictims to lower depths of degradation and despair.\r\n\r\nThe men who were judicially murdered in Chicago in 1887, in the name of\r\nthe great State of Illinois, were the avant couriers of a better day.\r\nThey were called anarchists, but at their trial it was not proven that\r\nthey had committed any crime or violated any law. They had protested\r\nagainst unjust laws and their brutal administration. They stood between\r\noppressor and oppressed, and they dared, in a free (?) country, to\r\nexercise the divine right of free speech; and the records of their\r\ntrial, as if written with an “iron pen and lead in the rock forever,”\r\nproclaim the truth of the declaration.\r\n\r\nI would rescue their names from slander. The slanderers of the dead are\r\nthe oppressors of the living. I would, if I could, restore them to their\r\nrightful positions as evangelists, the proclaimers of good news to their\r\nfellowmen—crusaders, to rescue the sacred shrines of justice from the\r\nprofanations of the capitalistic defilers who have made them more\r\nrepulsive than Augean stables. Aye, I would take them, if I could, from\r\npeaceful slumber in their martyr graves—I would place joint to joint in\r\ntheir dislocated necks—I would make the halter the symbol of\r\nredemption—I would restore the flesh to their skeleton bones—their eyes\r\nshould again flash defiance to the enemies of humanity, and their\r\ntongues, again, more eloquent than all the heroes of oratory, should\r\nspeak the truth to a gainsaying world. Alas, this cannot be done—but\r\nsomething can be done. The stigma fixed upon their names by an\r\noutrageous trial can be forever obliterated and their fame be made to\r\nshine with resplendent glory on the pages of history.\r\n\r\nUntil the time shall come, as come it will, when the parks of Chicago\r\nshall be adorned with their statues, and with holy acclaim, men, women\r\nand children, pointing to these monuments as testimonials of gratitude,\r\nshall honor the men who dared to be true to humanity and paid the\r\npenalty of their heroism with their lives, the preliminary work of\r\nsetting forth their virtues devolves upon those who are capable of\r\ngratitude to men who suffered death that they might live.\r\n\r\nThey were the men who, like Al-Hassen, the minstrel of the king, went\r\nforth to find themes of mirth and joy with which to gladden the ears of\r\nhis master, but returned disappointed, and, instead of themes to awaken\r\nthe gladness and joyous echoes, found scenes which dried all the\r\nfountains of joy. Touching his golden harp, Al-Hassen sang to the king\r\nas Parsons, Spies, Engel, Fielden, Fischer, Lingg, Schwab and Neebe\r\nproclaimed to the people:\r\n\r\n                                    “O king, at thy\r\n            Command I went into the world of men;\r\n            I sought full earnestly the thing which I\r\n            Might weave into the gay and lightsome song.\r\n            I found it, king; ’twas there. Had I the art\r\n            To look but on the fair outside, I nothing\r\n            Else had found. That art not mine, I saw what\r\n            Lay beneath. And seeing thus I could not sing;\r\n            For there, in dens more vile than wolf or jackal\r\n            Ever sought, were herded, stifling, foul, the\r\n            Writhing, crawling masses of mankind. Man!\r\n            Ground down beneath oppression’s iron heel,\r\n            Till God in him was crushed and driven back,\r\n            And only that which with the brute he shares\r\n            Finds room to upward grow.”\r\n\r\nSuch pictures of horror our martyrs saw in Chicago, as others have seen\r\nthem in all the great centers of population in the country. But, like\r\nthe noble minstrel, they proceeded to recite their discoveries and with\r\nhim moaned:\r\n\r\n                                  “And in this world\r\n           I saw how womanhood’s fair flower had\r\n           Never space its petals to unfold. How\r\n           Childhood’s tender bud was crushed and trampled\r\n           Down in mire and filth too evil, foul, for beasts\r\n           To be partakers in. For gold I saw\r\n           The virgin sold, and motherhood was made\r\n           A mock and scorn.\r\n\r\n                                  I saw the fruit of labor\r\n           Torn away from him who toiled, to further\r\n           Swell the bursting coffers of the rich, while\r\n           Babes and mothers pined and died of want.\r\n           I saw dishonor and injustice thrive. I saw\r\n           The wicked, ignorant, greedy, and unclean,\r\n           By means of bribes and baseness, raised to seats\r\n           Of power, from whence with lashes pitiless\r\n           And keen, they scourged the hungry, naked throng\r\n           Whom first they robbed and then enslaved.”\r\n\r\nSuch were the scenes that the Chicago martyrs had witnessed and which\r\nmay still be seen, and for reciting them and protesting against them\r\nthey were judicially murdered.\r\n\r\nIt was not strange that the hearts of the martyrs “grew into one with\r\nthe great moaning, throbbing heart” of the oppressed; not strange that\r\nthe nerves of the martyrs grew “tense and quivering with the throes of\r\nmortal pain”; not strange that they should pity and plead and protest.\r\nThe strange part of it is that in our high-noon of civilization a\r\ndamnable judicial conspiracy should have been concocted to murder them\r\nunder the forms of law.\r\n\r\nThat such is the truth of history, no honest man will attempt to deny;\r\nhence the demand, growing more pronounced every day, to snatch the names\r\nof these martyred evangelists of labor emancipation from dishonor and\r\nadd them to the roll of the most illustrious dead of the nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Mother Jones\r\n\r\n                 _Appeal to Reason, November 23, 1907_\r\n\r\n“The ‘Grand Old Woman’ of the revolutionary movement” is the appropriate\r\ntitle given to Mother Jones by Walter Hurt. All who know her—and they\r\nare legion—will at once recognize the fitness of the title.\r\n\r\nThe career of this unique old agitator reads like romance. There is no\r\nother that can be compared to it. For fifteen years she has been at the\r\nforefront, and never once has she been known to flinch.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of the Pullman strike in 1894, when she first came into\r\nprominence, she has been steadily in the public eye. With no desire to\r\nwear “distinction’s worthless badge,” utterly forgetful of self and\r\nscorning all selfish ambitions, this brave woman has fought the battles\r\nof the oppressed with a heroism more exalted than ever sustained a\r\nsoldier upon the field of carnage.\r\n\r\nMother Jones is not one of the “summer soldiers” or “sunshine patriots.”\r\nHer pulses burn with true patriotic fervor, and wherever the battle\r\nwaxes hottest there she surely will be found upon the firing line.\r\n\r\nFor many weary months at a time she has lived amid the most desolate\r\nregions of West Virginia, organizing the half-starved miners, making her\r\nhome in their wretched cabins, sharing her meagre substance with their\r\nfamilies, nursing the sick and cheering the disconsolate—a true minister\r\nof mercy.\r\n\r\nDuring the great strike in the anthracite coal district she marched at\r\nthe head of the miners; was first to meet the sheriff and the soldiers,\r\nand last to leave the field of battle.\r\n\r\nAgain and again has this dauntless soul been driven out of some\r\ncommunity by corporation hirelings, enjoined by courts, locked up in\r\njail, prodded by the bayonets of soldiers, and threatened with\r\nassassination. But never once in all her self-surrendering life has she\r\nshown the white feather; never once given a single sign of weakness or\r\ndiscouragement. In the Colorado strikes Mother Jones was feared, as was\r\nno other, by the criminal corporations; feared by them as she was loved\r\nby the sturdy miners she led again and again in the face of overwhelming\r\nodds until, like Henry of Navarre, where her snow-white crown was seen,\r\nthe despairing slaves took fresh courage and fought again with all their\r\nwaning strength against the embattled foe.\r\n\r\nDeported at the point of bayonets, she bore herself so true a warrior\r\nthat she won even the admiration of the soldiers, whose order it was to\r\nescort her to the boundary lines and guard against her return.\r\n\r\nNo other soldier in the revolutionary cause has a better right to\r\nrecognition in this edition than has Mother Jones.\r\n\r\nHer very name expresses the Spirit of the Revolution.\r\n\r\nHer striking personality embodies all its principles.\r\n\r\nShe has won her way into the hearts of the nation’s toilers, and her\r\nname is revered at the altars of their humble firesides and will be\r\nlovingly remembered by their children and their children’s children\r\nforever.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  John Brown: History’s Greatest Hero\r\n\r\n                 _Appeal to Reason, November 23, 1907_\r\n\r\nThe most picturesque character, the bravest man and most\r\nself-sacrificing soul in American history, was hanged at Charlestown,\r\nVa., December 2, 1859.\r\n\r\nOn that day Thoreau said: “Some eighteen hundred years ago Christ was\r\ncrucified. This morning, perchance, Captain Brown was hung. These are\r\nthe two ends of a chain which is not without its links. He is not ‘Old\r\nBrown’ any longer; he is an Angel of Light. * * * I foresee the time\r\nwhen the painter will paint that scene, no longer going to Rome for a\r\nsubject; the poet will sing it, the historian record it, and with the\r\nlanding of the Pilgrims and the Declaration of Independence it will be\r\nthe ornament of some future national gallery, when at least the present\r\nform of slavery shall be no more here. We shall then be at liberty to\r\nweep for Captain Brown.”\r\n\r\nFew people dared on that fateful day to breathe a sympathetic word for\r\nthe grizzled old agitator. For years he had carried on his warfare\r\nagainst chattel slavery. He had only a handful of fanatical followers to\r\nsupport him. But to his mind his duty was clear, and that was enough. He\r\nwould fight it out to the end, and if need be alone.\r\n\r\nOld John Brown set an example of moral courage and of single-hearted\r\ndevotion to an ideal for all men and for all ages.\r\n\r\nWith every drop of his honest blood he hated slavery, and in his early\r\nmanhood he resolved to lay his life on Freedom’s altar in wiping out\r\nthat insufferable affliction. He never faltered. So God-like was his\r\nunconquerable soul that he dared to face the world alone.\r\n\r\nHow perfectly sublime!\r\n\r\nHe did not reckon the overwhelming numbers against him, nor the paltry\r\nfew that were on his side. This grosser aspect of the issue found no\r\nlodgment in his mind or heart. He was right and Jehovah was with him.\r\nHis was not to reckon consequences, but to strike the immortal blow and\r\nstep from the gallows to the throne of God.\r\n\r\nNot for earthly glory did John Brown wage his holy warfare; not for any\r\nrecognition or reward the people had it in their power to bestow. His\r\ngreat heart was set upon a higher goal, animated by a loftier ambition.\r\nHis grand soul was illumined by a sublimer ideal. A race of human\r\nbeings, lowly and despised, were in chains, and this festering crime was\r\neating out the heart of civilization.\r\n\r\nIn the presence of this awful plague logic was silent, reason dumb, pity\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nThe wrath of retributive justice, long asleep, awakened at last and\r\nhurled its lurid bolt. Old John Brown struck the blow and the storm\r\nbroke. That hour chattel slavery was dead.\r\n\r\nIn the first frightful convulsion the slave power seized the grand old\r\nliberator by the throat, put him in irons and threw him into a dungeon\r\nto await execution.\r\n\r\nAlas! it was too late. His work was done. All Virginia could do was to\r\nfurnish the crown for his martyrdom.\r\n\r\nVictor Hugo exclaimed in a burst of reverential passion: “John Brown is\r\ngrander than George Washington!”\r\n\r\nHistory may be searched in vain for an example of noble heroism and\r\nsublime self-sacrifice equal to that of Old John Brown.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of his career to its close he had but one idea and\r\none ideal, and that was to destroy chattel slavery; and in that cause he\r\nsealed his devotion with his noble blood. Realizing that his work was\r\ndone, he passed serenely, almost with joy, from the scenes of men.\r\n\r\nHis calmness upon the gallows was awe-inspiring; his exaltation supreme.\r\n\r\nOld John Brown is not dead. His soul still marches on, and each passing\r\nyear weaves new garlands for his brow and adds fresh lustre to his\r\ndeathless glory.\r\n\r\nWho shall be the John Brown of Wage-Slavery?\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Martin Irons, Martyr\r\n\r\n                           _December 9, 1900_\r\n\r\nIt was in 1886 that Martin Irons, as chairman of the executive board of\r\nthe Knights of Labor of the Gould southwest railway system, defied\r\ncapitalist tyranny, and from that hour he was doomed. All the powers of\r\ncapitalism combined to crush him, and when at last he succumbed to\r\noverwhelming odds, he was hounded from place to place until he was\r\nragged and foot-sore and the pangs of hunger gnawed at his vitals.\r\n\r\nFor fourteen long years he fought single-handed the battle against\r\npersecution. He tramped far, and among strangers, under an assumed name,\r\nsought to earn enough to get bread. But he was tracked like a beast and\r\ndriven from shelter. For this “poor wanderer of a stormy day” there was\r\nno pity. He had stood between his class and their oppressors—he was\r\nbrave, and would not flinch; he was honest, and he would not sell; this\r\nwas his crime, and he must die.\r\n\r\nMartin Irons came to this country from Scotland a child. He was\r\nfriendless, penniless, alone. At an early age he became a machinist. For\r\nyears he worked at his trade. He had a clear head and a warm heart. He\r\nsaw and felt the injustice suffered by his class. Three reductions in\r\nwages in rapid succession fired his blood. He resolved to resist. He\r\nappealed to his fellow-workers. When the great strike came, Martin Irons\r\nwas its central figure. The men felt they could trust him. They were not\r\nmistaken.\r\n\r\nWhen at the darkest hour Jay Gould sent word to Martin Irons that he\r\nwished to see him, the answer came, “I am in Kansas City.” Gould did not\r\nhave gold enough to buy Irons. This was the greatest crime of labor’s\r\nhonest leader. The press united in fiercest denunciation. Every lie that\r\nmalignity could conceive was circulated. In the popular mind Martin\r\nIrons was the blackest-hearted villain that ever went unhung. Pinkerton\r\nblood-hounds tracked him night and day.\r\n\r\nBut through it all this loyal, fearless, high-minded workingman stood\r\nsteadfast.\r\n\r\nThe courts and soldiers responded to the command of their masters, the\r\nrailroads; the strike was crushed and the workingmen were beaten.\r\n\r\nMartin Irons had served, suffered for and honored his class. But he had\r\nlost. His class now turned against him and joined in the execration of\r\nthe enemy. This pained him more than all else. But he bore even this\r\nwithout a murmur, and if ever a despairing sigh was wrung from him it\r\nwas when he was alone.\r\n\r\nAnd thus it has been all along the highway of the centuries, from Jesus\r\nChrist to Martin Irons.\r\n\r\nLet it not be said that Irons was not crucified. For fourteen years he\r\nwas nailed to the cross, and no martyr to humanity ever bore his\r\ncrucifixion with finer fortitude.\r\n\r\nHe endured the taunts and jeers and all the bitter mockery of fate with\r\npatient heroism; and even when the poor dumb brutes whose wounds and\r\nbruises he would have swathed with his own heart-strings turned upon and\r\nrent him, pity sealed his lips and silent suffering wrought for him a\r\nmartyr’s crown.\r\n\r\nMartin Irons was hated by all who were too base or ignorant to\r\nunderstand him. He died despised, yet shall he live beloved.\r\n\r\nNo president of the United States gave or tendered him a public office\r\nin testimony of his service to the working class. The kind of service he\r\nrendered was too honest to be respectable, too aggressive and\r\nuncompromising to be popular.\r\n\r\nThe blow he struck for his class will preserve his memory. In the great\r\nstruggle for emancipation he nobly did his share, and the history of\r\nlabor cannot be written without his name.\r\n\r\nHe was an agitator, and as such shared the common fate of all. Jesus\r\nChrist, Joan of Arc, Elijah Lovejoy, John Brown, Albert Parsons and many\r\nothers set the same example and paid the same penalty.\r\n\r\nFor the reason that he was a despised agitator and shunned of men too\r\nmean and sordid to comprehend the lofty motive that inspired him, he\r\nwill be remembered with tenderness and love long after the last of his\r\ndetractors shall have mouldered in a forgotten grave.\r\n\r\nIt was in April, 1899, in Waco, Texas, that I last pressed this\r\ncomrade’s hand. He bore the traces of poverty and broken health, but his\r\nspirit was as intrepid as when he struck the shield of Hoxie thirteen\r\nyears before; and when he spoke of Socialism he seemed transfigured, and\r\nall the smouldering fires within his soul blazed from his sunken eyes\r\nonce more.\r\n\r\nI was pained, but not surprised, when I read that he had “died penniless\r\nin an obscure Texas town.” It is his glory and society’s shame that he\r\ndied that way.\r\n\r\nHis weary body has at last found rest, and the grandchildren of the men\r\nand women he struggled, suffered and died for will weave chaplets where\r\nhe sleeps.\r\n\r\nHis epitaph might read: “For standing bravely in defense of the working\r\nclass, he was put to death by slow torture.”\r\n\r\nMartin Irons was an honest, courageous, manly man. The world numbers one\r\nless since he has left it.\r\n\r\nBrave comrade, love, and farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Thomas McGrady\r\n\r\n                 _Appeal to Reason, December 14, 1907_\r\n\r\nIt is a strange and pathetic coincidence that almost at the very moment\r\nI completed the introduction to the brochure of Thomas McGrady on “The\r\nCatholic Church and Socialism,” now in press, the sad news came that he\r\nhad passed away, and the painful duty now devolves upon me to write the\r\nword “finis” at the close of his work and add a few words of obitual\r\neulogy.\r\n\r\nIt is not customary among Socialists to pronounce conventional and\r\nmeaningless panegyrics upon departed comrades; nor to pay fulsome\r\ntribute to virtues they never possessed. Mere form and ceremony have had\r\ntheir day—and a long and gloomy day it has been—and can have no place\r\namong Socialists when a comrade living pays his last reverent regards to\r\na comrade dead.\r\n\r\nThomas McGrady was born at Lexington, Ky., June 6, 1863. In 1887, at 24\r\nyears of age, he was ordained as a Catholic priest at the Cathedral of\r\nGalveston, Tex. His next pastorate was St. Patrick’s church, Houston,\r\nfollowed by his transfer to St. Patrick’s church, Dallas, Tex. In 1890\r\nhe returned to his Kentucky home, beginning his pastoral service there\r\nin Lexington, his native city. Later he went to St. Anthony’s church,\r\nBellevue, Ky., and it was here, in 1896, that he began his first serious\r\nstudy of economic, political and social questions. He was first\r\nattracted by Henry George’s Single Tax, but abandoned that as inadequate\r\nafter some Socialist literature fell into his hands, and he became\r\nconvinced that nothing less than a social revolution, and the abolition\r\nof the capitalist competitive system would materially better the\r\nexisting industrial and social condition of the people.\r\n\r\nFather McGrady, who always had the lofty courage of his convictions, now\r\navowed himself a Socialist. He drank deep at the fountain of Socialist\r\nliterature and mastered its classics. His library contained the works of\r\nthe standard authors of all nations.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that Father McGrady was at the very pinnacle of his\r\npriestly power and popularity. He was young, just past thirty, brilliant\r\nand scholarly. His magnetic personality was irresistible. Tall, fully\r\nsix feet, splendidly proportioned, commanding, he was a magnificent\r\nspecimen of physical manhood. He had a massive head, a full, fine face,\r\nflorid complexion, clear features, and the bluest, kindliest and most\r\nexpressive of eyes.\r\n\r\nWidely and deeply read, cultured in the genuine sense, sociable and\r\nsympathetic, Father McGrady attracted friends by an irresistible charm,\r\nand held them by the same magic power.\r\n\r\nHe was an orator and a wit, a scholar and a humanitarian.\r\n\r\nHe had the exquisite fancy of a poet and could dally, according to mood,\r\nwith a daisy or a star.\r\n\r\nIn his heroic and finely moulded physical proportions, his large and\r\nshapely head, clear complexion and expressive eyes, he resembled\r\nstrongly Robert G. Ingersoll.\r\n\r\nThis resemblance was accentuated by the kindly and infectious humor, the\r\nbrilliant flashes of wit, the terse and epigrammatic speech, and the\r\nkeen and incisive satire of which both were master.\r\n\r\nThese two men, had they not been separated by the cruel and hateful\r\nprejudices inherent in capitalist society, and all its conventional\r\ninstitutions, would have been the boonest of friends and loved each\r\nother as brothers.\r\n\r\nFather McGrady soon began to feel that his new convictions did not fit\r\nhis old conventicle. Honesty and candor being his predominant\r\ncharacteristics, the truth that dawned upon his brain found ready\r\nexpression from his eloquent lips. He took his congregation into his\r\nconfidence and told them frankly that he was a Socialist. Thenceforward\r\nevery discourse attested that fact. He was warned by the bishop,\r\nthreatened by the archbishop, but his flock closed around him, a living,\r\nthrobbing citadel. He ministered to them in their suffering, comforted\r\nthem in their sorrow, solemnized their nuptial vows, baptized their\r\nbabes, tenderly laid to rest their dead, and they truly loved him.\r\n\r\nBut the conviction that the orthodox pulpit and the forum of freedom\r\nwere irreconcilable, and that as a priest he was in the fetters of\r\ntheology, grew upon him, and in spite of the pleadings and protestings\r\nof his followers he resigned his pastorate and withdrew from the\r\npriesthood. The touching scene attending his farewell sermon has never\r\nbeen described, and never will be, in human speech. The congregation,\r\nseeming more like one great family, under Father McGrady’s tender and\r\naffectionate ministrations, felt stricken as if by an unspeakably sad\r\npersonal bereavement, and sat in silence as they paid homage to their\r\ndeparting friend and pastor in sobs and tears.\r\n\r\nThe tremendous public reception given the modern Saul at Cincinnati,\r\nacross the Ohio from his Kentucky home, is vividly remembered by\r\nthousands who struggled in the crush of common humanity to get within\r\nsound of his voice. He was now a full-fledged Social Revolutionist, and\r\nlike his immortal prototype of many centuries ago, the common people\r\nheard him gladly.\r\n\r\nThe formal abdication of the priesthood by Father McGrady created a\r\ngreat sensation. The dignitaries of the church affected pious rejoicing.\r\nThe recreant priest had long been a thorn in their complacent flesh. It\r\nwas well that the holy church was purged of his pernicious influence.\r\n\r\nColumns of reports appeared in the daily papers, and the features of the\r\nconverted priest, with which these accounts were embellished, became\r\nfamiliar to hundreds of thousands. A Socialist priest was indeed an\r\nanomaly. Vast concourses of people were attracted by the mere mention of\r\nhis name. When he was announced to speak, standing room was always at a\r\npremium.\r\n\r\nMcGrady was now at his best. The deep convictions he was now free to\r\nexpress flowered in his speech and his oratory, like the peals of a\r\ngreat organ and the chimes of sweet bells, moved and swayed the eager\r\nmasses. Everywhere the eloquent exponent of Socialism and pleader for\r\nthe oppressed was in demand. His fame preceded his footsteps.\r\nAuditoriums, theaters and public halls were taxed to their capacity. The\r\neloquent Socialist evangelist was now one of the commanding figures of\r\nthe American platform. He was doing, superbly doing, the grand work for\r\nwhich he had been fitted as if by special providence. From the Atlantic\r\nseaboard to the Pacific slope his resonant voice was heard and the\r\nmultitude were stirred by his burning message of social regeneration.\r\n\r\nIt was in the midst of these oratorical triumphs that the first distinct\r\nshock of organized opposition was felt. The capitalist press as a unit,\r\nand as if by preconcerted action, cut him out of its columns. The\r\nsensation created by McGrady’s leap from the Catholic pulpit to the\r\nSocialist platform had been fully exploited as far as its news value was\r\nconcerned, and now the renegade priest, as his whilom paters in Christ,\r\nwho profess to love their enemies, call him, must be relegated to\r\noblivion by being totally ignored. The church he formerly served so\r\nfaithfully now began to-actively pursue him. Where he was announced to\r\nspeak priests admonished the faithful, either openly from the pulpit or\r\ncovertly through the confessional, not to stain their souls by venturing\r\nnear the anti-Christ. But this form of opposition, however vexatious,\r\ntrying and difficult to overcome, but aroused the latent spirit of the\r\ncrusader and intensified his determination. In the fierce fires of\r\npersecution, fed and fanned by religious ignorance and fanaticism, he\r\nwas tempered for the far greater work that spread out before him, rich\r\nand radiant as a field of promise.\r\n\r\n“Unhappy man!” as Hugo wrote of Marshal Ney, who bared his breast to the\r\nleaden hail of English foe on the field of Waterloo, “Thou wast reserved\r\nfor French bullets!”\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding that McGrady was attracting vast audiences, including\r\nmany who had never before heard the philosophy of Socialism expounded,\r\nthe very ones most desired, and without whom progress is impossible;\r\nnotwithstanding the door receipts almost uniformly recouped the treasury\r\nof the local Socialists by a substantial net balance, certain “leaders,”\r\nwhose narrow prejudices were inflamed by the new agitator’s success and\r\nincreasing popularity in the movement, began to turn upon him, and sting\r\nhim with venomous innuendo or attack him openly through the Socialist\r\npress.\r\n\r\nParadoxical as it may seem, he was denied the right to serve the\r\nSocialist movement—by Socialists.\r\n\r\nAmong the first charges brought against him—not by capitalists; they\r\nwere too wise, if not too decent, to utter such a palpable untruth, but\r\nby men calling themselves Socialists—was that he had joined the movement\r\nas a “grafter,” and was making Socialist speeches for “the money there\r\nwas in it.”\r\n\r\nA baser falsehood, a more atrocious slander was never uttered.\r\n\r\nHad McGrady been a miserable grafter instead of a great white soul, he\r\nwould have remained in the pulpit. His people worshipped him and his\r\n“superiors” held out the most glittering inducements if he would only\r\nabandon his wicked and abominable “economic heresies.” The eloquence and\r\npower of the young priest were widely recognized in church circles. A\r\nbrilliant future spread out before him. He could easily become the\r\npetted and pampered favorite of the fathers. But he spurned the life of\r\nease and luxury at the price of his self-respect. The positions of\r\neminence he might attain by stifling his convictions sank to degradation\r\nfrom his lofty point of view.\r\n\r\nTurning his back upon the wealth and luxury of the capitalist class he\r\ncast his lot with the proletariat, the homeless and hungry, the ragged\r\nand distressed, and this he did, according to some Socialists, to\r\n“graft” on them, and the cry was raised, “The grafter must go!”\r\n\r\nIt was this that shocked his tender sensibilities, silenced his eloquent\r\ntongue, and broke his noble and generous heart.\r\n\r\nThose Socialists who vilified him as a “sky pilot,” and as a “grafter,”\r\nwho declared him to be “unsound,” “unscientific,” and who indulged in\r\nsimilar tirade and twaddle, ought now to be satisfied. Their ambition\r\nhas been realized. They scourged the “fakir” from the platform with\r\nwhips of asps into a premature grave and he will trouble them no more.\r\nMay they find it in their consciences to forgive themselves.\r\n\r\nThere is a deep lesson in the melancholy and untimely death of Comrade\r\nThomas McGrady. Let us hope that so much good may result from it that\r\nthe cruel sacrifice may be softened by the atonement and serve the\r\nfuture as a noble and inspiring example.\r\n\r\nWhile it is the duty of every member to guard the movement against the\r\nimposter, the chronic suspicion that a man who has risen above the\r\nmental plane of a scavenger is a “grafter” is a besetting sin, and has\r\ndone incalculable harm to the movement. The increasing cry from the same\r\nsource that only the proletariat is revolutionary and that\r\n“intellectuals” are middle class reactionaries is an insult to the\r\nmovement, many of whose staunchest supporters are of the latter type.\r\nMoreover, it would imply by its sneering allusion to the “intellectuals”\r\nthat the proletariat are a brainless rabble, reveling in their base\r\ndegeneracy and scorning intellectual enlightenment.\r\n\r\nMany a fine spirit who would have served the movement as an effective\r\nagitator and powerful advocate, stung to the quick by the keen lash in\r\nthe hand of a “comrade,” has dropped into silence and faded into\r\nobscurity.\r\n\r\nFortunately the influence of these self-appointed censors is waning. The\r\nmovement is no longer a mere fanatical sect. It has outgrown that period\r\nin spite of its sentinels and doorkeepers.\r\n\r\nBetween watchful devotion, which guards against imposters and chronic\r\nheresy hunting, which places a premium upon dirt and stupidity, and\r\nimposes a penalty upon brains and self-respect, there is a difference\r\nwide as the sea. The former is a virtue which cannot be too highly\r\ncommended, the latter a vice which cannot be too severely condemned.\r\n\r\nThomas McGrady was an absolutely honest man. Almost ten years of\r\nintimate and varied relations with him enables the writer to\r\nconscientiously pay him this tribute—to place this perennial flower\r\nwhere he sleeps.\r\n\r\nNo attempt is made to convert our deceased comrade into a saint. Could\r\nhe speak he would not be shorn of his foibles. Like all great souls he\r\nhad his faults—the faults that attested his humanity and brought into\r\nmore perfect relief the many virtues which adorned his manly character\r\nand enriched his noble life.\r\n\r\nThomas McGrady found joy in social service and his perfect consecration\r\nto his social ideals was the crowning glory of his life and the bow of\r\npromise at his death.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Looking Backward\r\n\r\n                 _Appeal to Reason, November 23, 1907_\r\n\r\nBefore me lies a copy of the Philadelphia _Evening Herald_, bearing date\r\nof June 21, 1877. On that day the “Mollie Maguires” were executed, six\r\nof them—Boyle, McGeghan, Munley, Roarity, Carroll and Duffy—at\r\nPottsville; four of them—Campbell, Doyle, Kelly and Donahue—at Mauch\r\nChunk, and one—Lanahan—at Wilkesbarre. They all protested their\r\ninnocence and all died game. Not one of them betrayed the slightest\r\nevidence of fear or weakening. The issue of the _Herald_ referred to\r\ncontains a full account of the executions, with portraits of the hapless\r\nvictims.\r\n\r\nNot long ago in the jail at Pottsville I stood on the spot where the six\r\n“Mollies” met their doom, and I uncovered in memory of their martyrdom.\r\n\r\nNot one of them was a murderer at heart. All were ignorant, rough and\r\nuncouth, born of poverty and buffeted by the merciless tides of fate and\r\nchance.\r\n\r\nTo resist the wrongs of which they and their fellow-workers were the\r\nvictims and to protect themselves against the brutality of their bosses,\r\naccording to their own crude notions, was the prime object of the\r\norganization of the “Mollie Maguires.” Nothing could have been farther\r\nfrom their intention than murder or crime. It is true that their methods\r\nwere drastic, but it must be remembered that their lot was hard and\r\nbrutalizing; that they were the neglected children of poverty, the\r\nproducts of a wretched environment.\r\n\r\nAt the scenes of the execution the tragedy is today, thirty years later,\r\nstill spoken of in whispers. A vague dread of reviving the fearful past\r\nseems to silence the tongue of the resident when the subject is\r\nintroduced. But bit by bit the truth has slowly and painfully filtered\r\nthrough the dungeon doors of false history, and the world is beginning\r\nto understand the true inwardness of the “Mollie Maguire” organization\r\nand its real relation to the labor movement.\r\n\r\nThese unfortunate victims of the basest betrayal since the days of Judas\r\nhad no possible means of defense or justification. The corporate press\r\nhowled like fiends incarnate for their blood. They had dared to assert\r\nthemselves against a powerful and piratical corporation, and this was\r\nsufficient warrant for their extermination. Spies, informers and\r\nassassins wormed their slimy way into their councils. Bloody crimes were\r\ninstigated and committed; the innocent and ignorant “Mollies” walked\r\ninto the traps set for them.\r\n\r\nThe powers of the law now fell upon them with crushing effect. Their\r\norganization was annihilated. No friendly voice pleaded in extenuation\r\nof the crimes charged upon the leaders.\r\n\r\nThe labor movement was in its infancy; it had no press and no standing;\r\nno influence and no power. There was but one side to the tragedy and\r\nthat was, of course, the capitalist side. The poor, dumb victims, bound\r\nand gagged, had but to await their bloody fate. At the grates of their\r\ncells the hounds of hell snarled and growled with savage ferocity to lap\r\ntheir blood. No helping hand was extended, and scarce a whisper of\r\nkindness was ventured in their behalf.\r\n\r\nJune 21, 1877, the curtain fell upon the last mournful act in this\r\ntragedy of toil. The executioner did his bidding and the gallows-tree\r\nclaimed its victims.\r\n\r\nOn that day history turned harlot and the fair face of truth was covered\r\nwith the hideous mask of falsehood.\r\n\r\nFor thirty years the press of corporate power has been lying grossly and\r\noutrageously about the “Mollie Maguires” and their organization. But the\r\ntruth will out at last, and the time is near when the history of the\r\nPennsylvania tragedy, as now written, will be radically revised and the\r\nnames of these martyrs rescued from the cruel calumny with which they\r\nhave been loaded.\r\n\r\nThe “Mollie Maguire” episode was incidental to the organization of the\r\nworking class; a link in the chain of the labor movement.\r\n\r\nThe men who perished upon the scaffold as felons were labor leaders, the\r\nfirst martyrs to the class struggle in the United States.\r\n\r\nIt is profoundly significant that Franklin B. Gowen, president of the\r\nPhiladelphia & Reading railway, and chief prosecutor and persecutor of\r\nthe “Mollie Maguires,” sought in suicide a refuge from the avenging\r\nNemesis that pursued him.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1876 the Workingmen’s party was organized, and in the\r\nfollowing year, 1877, after the execution of the “Molly Maguires,” it\r\nbecame the Socialistic Labor party.\r\n\r\nThis same year the great railroad strikes swept like a tidal wave from\r\nthe eastern to the western states.\r\n\r\nEight years later, in 1885, the Knights of Labor came into national\r\nprominence, and the great strikes on the Gould Southwest system in that\r\nyear and the year following were inaugurated.\r\n\r\nOn May 1, 1886, hundreds of thousands of workers in various parts of the\r\ncountry went on strike to enforce the eight-hour work day, the agitation\r\nincident to the movement culminating in the Haymarket tragedy of May 4.\r\n\r\nOn November 11 of the following year, 1887 (twenty years ago today),\r\noccurred the infamous execution of the anarchists at Chicago. This\r\njudicial massacre constitutes the blackest page in American history.\r\nWhen Parsons, Spies, Fischer and Engel were launched into eternity to\r\n“vindicate the majesty of the law,” a crime was committed of such\r\nenormity, that even at this late day the sober senses reel in its awful\r\ncontemplation.\r\n\r\nThese fellow-workers and their four comrades—Lingg, Fielden, Schwab and\r\nNeebe—the first of whom died by violence in his cell, and the last three\r\nof whom were sentenced to the penitentiary and subsequently pardoned by\r\nthe immortal Altgeld—were martyrs to the labor movement in the noblest\r\nsense of that term. They had fearlessly espoused the cause of labor and\r\nconsecrated themselves body and soul to the working class. They had the\r\ntrue revolutionary spirit, were animated by the loftiest motives, and\r\nwere utterly void of selfish ambitions.\r\n\r\nThe sordid capitalism which preys upon the life-blood of labor, whose\r\nethics are expressed in beastly gluttony and insatiable greed, and whose\r\ntrack of conquest is strewn with the bones of its countless victims,\r\npounced upon these men with the cruel malignity of fiends and strangled\r\nthem to death.\r\n\r\nA more cruel and heartless crime, a more flagrant outrage of justice,\r\nwas never committed. Twenty years have passed since these leaders of\r\nlabor paid the penalty of their loyalty, and marvelous have been the\r\nchanges in public sentiment since that day. They would not now be\r\nexecuted under the same circumstances. The workers today are too far\r\nadvanced, too well organized and too conscious of their class interests\r\nand duties to submit to such a monstrous outrage.\r\n\r\nThe recent trial and acquittal of Wm. D. Haywood proves it. Had labor\r\nbeen no farther advanced than it was twenty years ago, Moyer, Haywood,\r\nPettibone and Adams would long since have shared the fate of Parsons,\r\nSpies, Fischer and Engel.\r\n\r\nSince that fateful period of two decades ago, events have pressed each\r\nother closely in the world of labor. Three months after the execution of\r\nthe Haymarket victims the C., B. & Q. strike broke out in Chicago, and\r\nthe issue was hotly contested for almost a year before the employes\r\nfinally succumbed to defeat. From that time forward strikes, boycotts\r\nand lockouts were numerous, a long series of industrial battles marking\r\nthe path of the class struggle and the progress of the labor movement.\r\n\r\nHomestead, Buffalo, Chicago, Latimer, Virden, Pana, Leadville, Coeur\r\nd’Alene, Telluride and Cripple Creek followed in swift succession, each\r\nthe scene of a bloody battle in the historic struggle for emancipation.\r\n\r\nThe battle of the American Railway Union with the allied railroad\r\ncorporations in 1894 developed extraordinary activity on the part of our\r\ncapitalist government. The strikers were completely victorious at every\r\npoint when the government openly took sides with the railroads and\r\nemployed all its vast repressive machinery to defeat the strike and\r\ncrush out the union.\r\n\r\nThe lessons of this strike were among the most valuable ever learned by\r\nthe working class, and many thousands date their class-consciousness\r\nfrom that memorable conflict.\r\n\r\nThe more recent strikes in Colorado, Utah and other western states,\r\nculminating in the kidnapping conspiracy of the mine owners and the bold\r\nattempt to repeat the Haymarket and “Mollie Maguire” massacres, are\r\nstill fresh in the memory of the people, especially the rugged miners\r\nwho, under the banner of the Western Federation, fought with all the\r\nenergy and bravery of desperation against the plots and wiles of the\r\norganized mine owners, as unscrupulous and heartless an aggregation of\r\nexploiters as ever robbed and murdered their fellow-beings.\r\n\r\nLooking backward over the last thirty years, the progress of the labor\r\nmovement can be clearly traced, and its contemplation is fruitful of\r\ninexpressible satisfaction. Looking forward, the skies are bright and\r\nall the tongues of the future proclaim the glad tidings of the coming\r\nEmancipation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Labor Day Greeting\r\n\r\n              _Social Democratic Herald, September, 1904_\r\n\r\nThe workingman is the only man in whose presence I take off my hat. As I\r\nsalute him, I honor myself.\r\n\r\nThe workingman—and this is the day to write him in capital letters—has\r\ngiven me what I have, made me what I am, and will make me what I hope to\r\nbe; and I thank him for all, and above all for giving me eyes to see, a\r\nheart to feel and a voice to speak for the workingman.\r\n\r\nLike the rough hewn stone from which the noble statue is chiseled by the\r\nhand of man, the Toiler is the rough-hewn bulk from which the perfect\r\nMan is being chiseled by the hand of God.\r\n\r\nAll the workingmen of the earth are necessary to the whole\r\nWorkingman—and he alone will survive of all the human race.\r\n\r\nLabor Day is a good day to rest the hands and give the brain a chance—to\r\nthink about what has been, and is, and is yet to be.\r\n\r\nThe way has been long and weary and full of pain, and many have fallen\r\nby the wayside, but the Unconquerable Army of Labor is still on the\r\nmarch and as it rests on its arms today and casts a look ahead, it\r\nbeholds upon the horizon the first glowing rays of the Social Sunrise.\r\n\r\nCourage, comrades! The struggle must be won, for Peace will only come\r\nwhen she comes hand in hand with Freedom.\r\n\r\nThe right is with the labor movement and the gods of battle are with the\r\nWorking Class.\r\n\r\nThe Socialist Party and the Trade Union Movement must be one today in\r\ncelebration of Labor Day and pledge each other their mutual fidelity and\r\nsupport in every battle, economic and political, until the field is won\r\nand the Workingman is free.\r\n\r\nForget not the past on Labor Day! Think of Homestead! Think of Latimer!\r\nThink of Buffalo! Think of Coeur d’Alene! Think of Croton Dam! Think of\r\nChicago! Think of Virden! Think of Pana! Think of Leadville! Think of\r\nCripple Creek! Think of Victor! Think of Telluride!\r\n\r\nThese are some of the bloody battles fought in the past in the war of\r\nthe Workers for Industrial Freedom and Social Justice.\r\n\r\nHow many and how fierce and bloody shall be the battles of the future?\r\n\r\nComrades, this is the day for Workingmen to think of the Class Struggle\r\nand the Ballot—the day for Labor to clasp the hand of Labor and girdle\r\nthe globe with the International Revolutionary Solidarity of the Working\r\nClass.\r\n\r\nWe are all one—all workers of all lands and climes. We know not color,\r\nnor creed, nor sex in the Labor Movement. We know only that our hearts\r\nthrob with the same proletarian stroke, that we are keeping step with\r\nour class in the march to the goal and that the solidarity of Labor will\r\nvanquish slavery and Humanize the World.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Proclamation to American Railway Union\r\n\r\n  _Issued upon his sentence being affirmed by the Supreme Court of the\r\n                             United States_\r\n\r\n                                        TERRE HAUTE, IND., June 1, 1895.\r\n\r\nSirs and Brothers—A cruel wrong against our great order, perpetrated by\r\nWm. A. Woods, United States Circuit Judge, has been approved by the\r\nUnited States Supreme Court, and from under its shadow I address this\r\ncommunication to you; but though prison walls frown upon myself and\r\nothers whom you chose as officials, I assure you that neither\r\ndespondency nor despair has taken the place of the courage which has\r\ncharacterized our order since the storms of persecution first began to\r\nbeat upon us. Hope has not deserted us. Our faith in the future of our\r\ngreat order is as strong as when our banners waved triumphantly over the\r\nGreat Northern from St. Paul to the coast. Our order is still the\r\nundaunted friend of the toiling masses and our battle-cry now, as ever,\r\nis the emancipation of labor from degrading, starving and enslaving\r\nconditions. We have not lost faith in the ultimate triumph of truth over\r\nperjury, of justice over wrong, however exalted may be the stations of\r\nthose who perpetrate the outrages.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE STORM AND THE BATTLE.\r\n\r\nI need not remind you, comrades of the American Railway Union, that our\r\norder in the pursuit of the right was confronted with a storm of\r\nopposition such as never beat upon a labor organization in all time. Its\r\nbrilliant victory on the Great Northern and its gallant championship of\r\nthe unorganized employes of the Union Pacific had aroused the opposition\r\nof every railroad corporation in the land.\r\n\r\nTo crush the American Railway Union was the one tie that united them all\r\nin the bonds of vengeance; it solidified the enemies of labor into one\r\ngreat association, one organization which, by its fabulous wealth,\r\nenabled it to bring into action resources aggregating billions of money\r\nand every appliance that money could purchase. But in this supreme hour\r\nthe American Railway Union, undaunted, put forth its efforts to rescue\r\nPullman’s famine-cursed wage slaves from the grasp of an employer as\r\nheartless as a stone, as remorseless as a savage and as unpitying as an\r\nincarnate fiend. The battle fought in the interest of starving men,\r\nwomen and children stands forth in the history of Labor’s struggles as\r\nthe great “Pullman Strike.” It was a battle on the part of the American\r\nRailway Union fought for a cause as holy as ever aroused the courage of\r\nbrave men; it was a battle in which upon one side were men thrice armed\r\nbecause their cause was just, but they fought against the combined power\r\nof corporations which by the use of money could debauch justice, and, by\r\nplaying the part of incendiary, bring to their aid the military power of\r\nthe government, and this solidified mass of venality, venom and\r\nvengeance constituted the foe against which the American Railway Union\r\nfought Labor’s greatest battle for humanity.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         REWARDS AND PENALTIES.\r\n\r\nWhat has been your reward for your splendid courage and manifold\r\nsacrifices? Our enemies say they are summed up in the one word “defeat.”\r\nThey point to the battlefield and say: “Here is where the host of the\r\nAmerican Railway Union went down before the confederated enemy of\r\nlabor.” They point to the spot where Miles’ serried soldiery stood with\r\ndrawn swords, tramping steeds and shotted guns to kill innocent men\r\nwhose only crime was devotion to wretched men and women, the victims of\r\nPullman’s greed. They designate the places where the minions of a\r\ndespotic judge, the thieves and thugs, taken from Chicago slums,\r\ntransformed into deputy marshals and armed with clubs and pistols, went\r\nforth to murder indiscriminately and to arouse the vengeance of the\r\npeople by incendiary fires, and they point to the General Managers’\r\nAssociation, the Nero of the occasion, whose pitiless enmity of labor\r\nwould have glorified in widespread conflagration rather than permitted a\r\nstrike in the interest of famishing men, women and children, to have\r\nsucceeded; and such disasters, say the enemies of labor, are the rewards\r\nof the courage of the A. R. U. men, a courage as invincible as was ever\r\ndisplayed by Spartans, and which makes Pullman’s Labor Thermopylæ to\r\nlive in history as long as the right has a defender in the ranks of\r\nAmerican workingmen.\r\n\r\nBrothers of the American Railway Union, even in defeat our rewards are\r\ngrand beyond expression, rewards which come only to brave men, the\r\nconsciousness of noble deeds performed in the holy cause of labor’s\r\nemancipation. Cowards, the fawning, sycophantic poltroons of power,\r\nnever knew the thrills of joy that reward the heroes of battles fought\r\nin the interest of the oppressed.\r\n\r\n   “Once to ev’ry man and nation comes a moment to decide,\r\n   In the strife of Truth and Falsehood, for the good or evil side.”\r\n\r\nThe American Railway Union did decide. It espoused the cause of justice.\r\nIt furrowed the land deeper with its plows of Truth and Courage than had\r\nfallen to the lot of any other labor organization since time began, and\r\nthe seeds of emancipation which it sowed broadcast are germinating and a\r\nnew era is destined to dawn upon labor.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          TRUTH IT IS THAT THE\r\n\r\n“Sons of brutish Force and Darkness,” who have “drenched the earth with\r\nblood,” chuckle over their victories. They point to the blacklisted\r\nheroes of the American Railway Union, idle and poor, and count upon\r\ntheir surrender. Their hope is that our order will disband; that\r\npersecution, poverty and prison will do the work. These gory-handed\r\nenemies of our order expect to put out our lodge fires, silence our\r\nbattle cries, disrobe ourselves of courage and manhood, permit them to\r\nplace their ironshod hoofs on our neck and sink us to fathomless depths\r\nof degradation and make the American Railway Union the synonym of all\r\nthings the most detestable.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CAN THEY DO IT?\r\n\r\nIn the presence of prison doors and prison bars and weary months of\r\nincarceration, I answer a thousand times, NO! In the grasp of despotic\r\npower, as infamous and as cruel as ever blackened the records of Russia,\r\nI treat with ineffable scorn the power that without trial sends me and\r\nmy official associates of the American Railway Union to prison. I do not\r\nbelieve, nor will I believe, that my brothers, beloved of our great\r\norder, will throw their courage away and join the ranks of the enemy,\r\nwhile their comrades, the victims of worse than Russian vengeance, are\r\nsuffering in prison.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               IN RUSSIA,\r\n\r\nthe land of the autocrat, liberty is unknown. In that thrice damned\r\ncountry liberty and justice, free speech and free press and trial by\r\njury are banished, and a trail of blood and tears from the palace of the\r\ndespot to prison and to death, made by men and women whose only crime is\r\na desire for freedom, tell their doom; and yet in Russia imprisonment,\r\ntorture and death only increase the ranks of men and women who cry,\r\n“Give me liberty or give me death.”\r\n\r\nIn Russia, the victim of autocratic displeasure is denied a trial by a\r\njury of his peers. Wm. A. Woods carries out the Russian practice. In\r\nRussia the doomed man or woman is arraigned before the supreme despot or\r\none of his numerous satraps. Truth, justice, mercy are forever exiled,\r\nhope disappears and only words of satanic cruelty are uttered. Age, sex,\r\ncharacter, innocence, name and condition count for nothing. It is enough\r\nto know that the brave soul yearned for freedom, and the penalty of\r\nexile, imprisonment, torture or death is inflicted, and it has come to\r\nthis at last in the United States of America, that the law of injunction\r\nis the will of a despot, and by the exercise of this Russian power\r\nAmerican Railway Union officials go to prison and the hope is that by\r\nthe exercising of this power the American Railway Union will be crushed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          STAND BY YOUR ORDER!\r\n\r\nAt this supreme juncture I call upon the members of the American Railway\r\nUnion to stand by their order. In God’s own good time we will make the\r\ndespot’s prison, where innocent men suffer, monumental. We will link\r\nthem with the legends and lore of labor’s struggles to be read by our\r\nchildren and our children’s children when Bartholdi’s goddess of liberty\r\nwith her torch enlightening the world has succumbed to the ravages of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n Count me o’er earth’s chosen heroes—they were souls that stood alone.\r\n (While the men they agonized for threw the contumelious stone)\r\n Stood serene and down the future saw the golden beam incline\r\n To the side of perfect justice, mastered by their faith divine,\r\n By one man’s plain truth to manhood and to God’s supreme design.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Flea and Donkey\r\n\r\nA flea nestled in the ear of a donkey. The flea bit off the tip of a\r\npore and lunched at leisure. The donkey brayed and kicked. Moral: The\r\ninterests of fleas and donkeys are identical. (See revised code civic\r\nfederation.)\r\n\r\nWithout fleas donkeys would have no incentive to kick and bray and would\r\nsoon completely lose their donkeyality.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Eye to Eye\r\n\r\nPresident Mitchell, of the United Mine Workers, is reported as saying\r\nthat if only the capitalist and workingman will look straight into each\r\nother’s eyes and speak the truth, there will be no more strikes. The\r\ntrouble is that, inasmuch as the capitalist is on the back of the\r\nworkingman, they can’t look into each other’s eyes unless the capitalist\r\ndismounts or the workingman twists his spine, and he is already\r\nsuffering from curvature of that sorely-strained member of his saddled,\r\nbridled, whipped and spurred organism.\r\n\r\nThe capitalist can hardly be expected to rein up and get down purely to\r\nsee the color of the optics of his “mount.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Stopped the Blacklist\r\n\r\n                  _Wayland’s Monthly, September, 1902_\r\n\r\nIt was on a mixed train on one of the mountain roads in the western\r\nstates. The conductor and both brakemen had already shown me their old\r\nA. R. U. cards, which they treasured with almost affectionate\r\ntenderness. The soiled, illegible scraps were souvenirs of the “war,”\r\nand revived a whole freight train of stirring reminiscences. The three\r\nweather-beaten trainmen were strangers prior to ’94; they were off of\r\nthree separate roads, and from three different states.\r\n\r\nEach of the brakemen had told the story of his persecution after the\r\nstrike. The companies had declared that no A. R. U. striker should ever\r\nhave another job on a railroad, and they were doing their level best to\r\nmake good their brutal avowal. These two brakemen had to suffer long in\r\nthe role of the “wandering Jew.” Again and again they had secured jobs,\r\nunder assumed names and otherwise, but as soon as they were found out\r\nthey were dismissed with the highly edifying information that the\r\ncompany no longer needed their services.\r\n\r\nThey were on the railroad blacklist. Only they know what this means who\r\nhave been there. Many times had these brakemen been hungry, many times\r\nejected from trains, often footsore after a weary walk to the next\r\ndivision point. But they bore it all and made no complaint. Fortunately\r\nthey were both single men and their privations were at least free from\r\nthe harrowing thought that wife and child were being tortured by their\r\nmerciless persecutors. They finally conquered the blacklist and were\r\nonce more allowed to become the slaves of the railroads.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was about noon when the conductor tapped me on the shoulder and\r\ninvited me into the baggage end of the car to have dinner with the crew.\r\nThey had their own kitchen and cooking utensils and had managed to dish\r\nup a most appetizing bill of fare. I was first served with a steaming\r\nplatter of “mulligan,” a popular dish with the mountain men. Then\r\nfollowed cold meat, bread and butter and hot coffee, topped off with a\r\nquarter section of pie.\r\n\r\nThe pipes were next lighted and a lively exchange of reminiscence\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\nThe conductor was obliged to leave us for a time and while he was gone\r\nthe two brakemen told me how he had “stopped the blacklist.” It is a\r\nshort but immensely suggestive story. The conductor, like all brave men,\r\nwas too modest to tell it himself. Here it is:\r\n\r\nBill, that was the conductor’s name, was running a train on the S——\r\nrailway when the strike of ’94 came. He was also chairman of the local\r\ngrievance committee. He lost out with the rest and took his medicine\r\nwithout a whimper. When he left home to look for a job his wife had the\r\ncheerful assurance that she and the two children would soon hear from\r\nhim and that they would be united again at an early day.\r\n\r\nBill secured five jobs in straight succession. He was a firstclass\r\nrailroad man and could fill any kind of position. But as fast as he got\r\na job he lost it. The black demon was at his heels. He had offended his\r\nformer master and now he and his loving wife and innocent babes must\r\ndie.\r\n\r\nThe last job Bill had held good for some days before he was spied out\r\nand discharged. He drew $15, but he did not send it to his wife, nor did\r\nhe use it on himself. Bill had a grim determination written in every\r\nline of his swarthy face when he pocketed that $15 and his discharge,\r\nand started toward the city. He stopped short before a hardware store\r\nand his eyes scanned the display in the window. In less than five\r\nminutes he had entered, investigated and emerged again.\r\n\r\nWith rapid strides the blacklisted man hurried toward the railroad\r\nstation.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe next see Bill on the streets of his old home. His friends, if any\r\nremained, would scarce have recognized him. Upon his wan features there\r\nwas an ugly look that boded ill to someone, and in his hip pocket a\r\nloaded six-shooter was ready for action.\r\n\r\nThe superintendent turned deadly pale when Bill entered. He\r\ninstinctively read his indictment in Bill’s grim visage before a word\r\nwas spoken.\r\n\r\n“What can I do for you, Mr. ——?” tremblingly asked the pilloried\r\nofficial.\r\n\r\n“Not a damned thing,” replied Bill, in a strange, hoarse voice.\r\n\r\n“You know what I’m here for,” continued the victim of the blacklist,\r\n“and if you’ve got any prayers to offer before I make a lead mine of\r\nyour carcass, you’d better begin at once.”\r\n\r\nWhile Bill spoke the superintendent looked into the murderous pistol\r\npointed at him by the desperate man, and an instant later his office was\r\nturned into a prayer meeting. Such piteous pleas were rarely heard from\r\nsuch coward lips.\r\n\r\nBill’s heart was touched; he would give the craven assassin another\r\nchance.\r\n\r\nWithdrawing the weapon and shoving it into his pocket, Bill looked the\r\nofficial straight in the eye and in a steady voice said: “You have\r\nbeaten me out of five jobs and you are responsible for my wife and\r\nbabies being homeless and hungry. You know that there is not a scratch\r\nupon my record as an employe, nor a stain upon my character as a man.\r\nYou have deliberately plotted to torture and kill an innocent woman and\r\ntwo babies who depend upon my labor, and by God, you deserve to die like\r\nthe dog you are. But I’m going to give you another chance for your\r\nlife—mark me, just one. I shall get another job, and I shall refer to\r\nyou as to my service record. If I lose that job, G—— d—— your black\r\nheart, you’ll do your blacklisting in hell, not here, for I’ll send you\r\nthere as sure as my name’s Bill ——.”\r\n\r\nThe superintendent drew a long breath of relief when Bill turned on his\r\nheels and left him alone. He did not doubt Bill’s word. It is hardly\r\nnecessary to say that the blacklist was ended. Bill got the job and\r\nholds it to this day. Not a man on the road is more respected than he,\r\nespecially by the officials.\r\n\r\nBill did not appeal to the courts. He took no chances on a brace game.\r\nHis nerve and his six-shooter settled the case and there were no costs\r\nto pay.\r\n\r\nBill and his two brakemen are now Socialists. The three hours I spent\r\nwith those three men rolling over the western mountains I shall remember\r\nalways with interest and satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Prince and Proletaire\r\n\r\n                         _Wilshire’s Magazine_\r\n\r\nThe two types represented in the above caption are brought into vivid\r\ncontrast by the visit of Prince Henry to our democratic domain and the\r\nhysterical demonstrations that assail him as he is whirled from point to\r\npoint in his royal carousal among the plebeians. According to reports\r\nthe royalty of the old world has been totally eclipsed by the democracy\r\nof the new, and his deputy imperial majesty is fairly dazzled and\r\nbewildered by the fast and furious display in his honor. At the opera in\r\nNew York he was surrounded by a palpitating wall of nude flesh, ablaze\r\nwith diamonds—a scene of gorgeous, glittering splendor compared with\r\nwhich the courts of kings are dim as dirt.\r\n\r\nAnd this is but an incident among a thousand in which our democratic (?)\r\npeople of every rank and station, save Socialistic alone, abase\r\nthemselves in vulgar fawning at the feet of tyranny. Shall the titled\r\nsnob be blamed for holding all such flunkeys in contempt?\r\n\r\nWho is this royal lion in the democratic den? A total stranger from an\r\nalien land. What has he done to command the reverence of a god? Ask\r\nyourself if you can answer. It is not then to the man—for he’s\r\nunknown—but to the Prince that Uncle Sam gets down full length into the\r\ndust and spreads the Stars and Stripes for royal feet to tread upon.\r\n\r\nWhat difference is there between the monarchy of William and the\r\nrepublic of Roosevelt? Could the Lick telescope discover it?\r\n\r\nBear in mind that here “we” are the people; “we” live in “the land of\r\nthe free and the home of the brave”; “we” are all sovereigns; “we” have\r\nno classes; “we” scorn royal snobs; “we” love liberty and despise\r\ndisplay; “we” hold “divine right to rule” in contempt; “we”—\r\n\r\nThe simple truth is we are like the rest—we have prince and pauper,\r\npower and poverty, money and misery in our capitalist republic, just as\r\nthey have in their capitalist monarchy across the water.\r\n\r\nChauncey M. Depew has 150 pairs of creased trousers; many of his\r\nsovereign constituents have patches on their only pair of pants.\r\n\r\nIn our great eastern cities more than half the people live in tenements\r\nunfit for habitation, and thousands of babes, denied fresh air, die\r\nevery year.\r\n\r\nThe sweating dens are packed with human vermin, but Henry, by the grace\r\nof God, will not behold the reeking ballast of the “ship of state.”\r\n\r\nA few rods from the Waldorf in New York and the Auditorium in Chicago,\r\nare the districts of the doomed and damned. The squares of squalor and\r\nmiles of misery inspire in men, instead of “Hoch der Kaiser,” the wish\r\n“to hear the nightingale sing new marseillaises” and revive the ominous\r\nnotes of “La Carmagnole.”\r\n\r\n            “Thus fares the land, by luxury betray’d;\r\n            In nature’s simplest charms at first array’d,\r\n            But verging to decline, its splendors rise,\r\n            Its vistas strike, its palaces surprise;\r\n            While, scourged by famine from the smiling land,\r\n            The mournful toiler leads his humble band;\r\n            And while he sinks, without one arm to save,\r\n            The country blooms—a garden, and a grave.”\r\n\r\nNot long ago the millionaires and labor leaders had a feast in New York;\r\nthey met as one, and declared that henceforth they were “one and\r\ninseparable, now and forever.” President Roosevelt ratified the compact\r\nby dining the leaders at the White House. But where are labor’s\r\nrepresentatives to the Prince Henry banquets and receptions? Have they\r\nbeen lost in the shuffle? Can it be that they are not fit to meet a\r\nprince? Absurd! This is a Republic; labor here is royal and wears the\r\nimperial crown. So, at least, Mr. Hanna and other poor and oppressed\r\ncapitalists tell us, and surely they should know the working kings who\r\nrule them.\r\n\r\nBut again, where are the representatives of labor at these courtly\r\nsocial functions? Why is no American workingman allowed near the prince\r\nexcept as menial and spaniel, to guard his noble majesty and do slavish\r\nobeisance to his every whim?\r\n\r\nWhy is there no inch of room for labor in any house or hall, or park, or\r\nboat in all this vaunted Republic when a “prince” is guest?\r\n\r\nWhy are the working class excluded from such “public” functions as\r\nrigidly as if they wore the stripes of convicts?\r\n\r\nWhy must a prince be guarded?\r\n\r\nOn “great occasions,” such as the presence of a royal guest, the streets\r\nand alleys are reserved for the working class, and in these\r\nthoroughfares the dead-lines of the common herd are guarded with\r\npolicemen’s clubs.\r\n\r\nHow melancholy to see shivering humans, packed together like cattle in a\r\ncar, rend one another in mad strife to honor those who look upon them as\r\nunclean and hold them in supreme contempt!\r\n\r\nThe working class of the United States, with few exceptions, cheered and\r\nshouted for the prince as though he had been their lord and savior. He\r\ncares no more for them, this pampered prince, than if they were so many\r\nsheep or swine, for he believes that royal blood, by God’s decree, flows\r\nthrough his veins and that common humans are but beasts of burden.\r\n\r\nNot long ago Ben Tillett came from England as the representative of\r\nlabor. All his life he worked to help the men of toil. In point of\r\nhonest worth Ben Tillett far outweighs ten thousand blooded princes. Yet\r\nworkingmen, except the few, ignored him, and the scant regard they\r\nshowed him is to their disgrace.\r\n\r\nThe point I make is, that from the time the ship that brought the prince\r\ntouched our shore until it left again no workingman was tolerated in any\r\nbanquet or reception tendered him in the name of the American people.\r\nOffice-holders and politicians spouted, while capitalists lined the\r\ntables and wined and dined themselves—all of which simply proves that\r\nthere are no classes in the United States, and that Socialism has no\r\nbusiness in a republic.\r\n\r\nThe envoys for the coronation of King Edward have been announced by\r\nPresident Roosevelt. There will be no hornyhanded prince of labor there.\r\nWhitelaw Reid, known only for being the opposite of Horace Greeley, and\r\nas small as he was great, will be our knee-breeched, official flunkey at\r\nthe crowning of the king.\r\n\r\nOf course it would not be consistent for our president to drop a crumb\r\nof comfort to the Boers.\r\n\r\nLet it not be understood that I have the slightest feeling against Henry\r\nof Prussia; it is the prince I have no use for. Personally, he may be a\r\ngood fellow, and I am inclined to believe he is, and if he were in\r\ntrouble and I had it in my power to help he would find in me a friend.\r\nThe amputation of his title would relieve him of his royal affliction\r\nand elevate him to the dignity of a man.\r\n\r\nThis is a necessary part of the mission of Socialism, and the\r\nrevolutionary movement is sweeping over the United States as well as\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nIt means the end of princes, the end of paupers and the beginning of\r\nMan.\r\n\r\n                 “To ears attuned, the victor’s shouts\r\n                   Are crossing o’er the sea;\r\n                 Resounding like Jove’s thunder peals\r\n                   The working class are free.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Revolution\r\n\r\n                   _New York Worker, April 27, 1907_\r\n\r\nThis is the first and only International Labor Day.

Crushed it may be, but extinguished never. Chain the\r\nslave as you will, O Masters, brutalize him as you may, yet in his soul,\r\nthough dead, he yearns for freedom still.\r\n\r\nThe great discovery the modern slaves have made is that they themselves\r\ntheir freedom must achieve. This is the secret of their solidarity; the\r\nheart of their hope; the inspiration that nerves them all with sinews of\r\nsteel.\r\n\r\n            They are still in bondage, but no longer cower;\r\n            No longer grovel in the dust,\r\n            But stand erect like men.\r\n\r\nConscious of their growing power the future holds out to them her\r\noutstretched hands.\r\n\r\nAs the slavery of the working class is international, so the movement\r\nfor its emancipation.\r\n\r\nThe salutation of slave to slave this day is repeated in every human\r\ntongue as it goes ringing round the world.\r\n\r\nThe many millions are at last awakening.

Tyrants and time-servers\r\nfear it, but the oppressed hail it with joy.\r\n\r\nThe throne trembles when this throbbing word is lisped, but to the hovel\r\nit is food for the famishing and hope for the victims of despair.\r\n\r\nLet us glorify today the revolutions of the past and hail the Greater\r\nRevolution yet to come before Emancipation shall make all the days of\r\nthe year May Days of peace and plenty for the sons and daughters of\r\ntoil.\r\n\r\nIt was with Revolution as his theme that Mark Twain’s soul drank deep\r\nfrom the fount of inspiration. His immortality will rest at last upon\r\nthis royal tribute to the French Revolution:\r\n\r\n“The ever memorable and blessed revolution, which swept a thousand years\r\nof villainy away in one swift tidal wave of blood—one: a settlement of\r\nthat hoary debt in the proportion of half a drop of blood for each\r\nhogshead of it that had been pressed by slow tortures out of that people\r\nin the weary stretch of ten centuries of wrong and shame and misery the\r\nlike of which was not to be mated but in hell. There were two Reigns of\r\nTerror, if we would but remember it and consider it: the one wrought\r\nmurder in hot passion, the other in heartless cold blood; the one lasted\r\nmere months, the other lasted a thousand years; the one inflicted death\r\non ten thousand persons, the other upon a hundred millions; but our\r\nshudders are all for the horrors of the minor Terror, so to speak;\r\nwhereas, what is the horror of swift death by the axe compared with\r\nlifelong death from hunger, cold, insult, cruelty and heartbreak? What\r\nis swift death by lightning compared with death by slow fire at the\r\nstake? A city cemetery could contain the coffins filled by that brief\r\nTerror, which we have all been so diligently taught to shiver at and\r\nmourn over, but all France could hardly contain the coffins filled by\r\nthat older and real Terror which none of us has been taught to see in\r\nits vastness or pity as it deserves.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Arouse, Ye Slaves!\r\n\r\n                   _Appeal to Reason, March 10, 1906_\r\n\r\nThe latest and boldest stroke of the plutocracy, but for the blindness\r\nof the people, would have startled the nation.\r\n\r\nMurder has been plotted and is about to be executed in the name and\r\nunder the forms of law.\r\n\r\nMen who will not yield to corruption and browbeating must be ambushed,\r\nspirited away and murdered.\r\n\r\nThat is the edict of the Mine Owners’ Association of the western states\r\nand their Standard Oil backers and pals in Wall street, New York.\r\n\r\nThese gory-beaked vultures are to pluck out the heart of resistance to\r\ntheir tyranny and robbery, that labor may be left stark naked at their\r\nmercy.\r\n\r\nCharles Moyer and Wm. D. Haywood, of the Western Federation of Miners,\r\nand their official colleagues—men, all of them, and every inch of\r\nthem—are charged with the assassination of ex-Governor Frank\r\nSteunenberg, of Idaho, who simply reaped what he had sown, as a mere\r\nsubterfuge to pounce upon them in secret, rush them out of the state by\r\nspecial train, under heavy guard, clap them into the penitentiary,\r\nconvict them upon the purchased perjured testimony of villains, and\r\nstrangle them to death with the hangman’s noose.\r\n\r\nIt is a foul plot; a damnable conspiracy; a hellish outrage.\r\n\r\nThe governors of Idaho and Colorado say they have the proof to convict.\r\nThey are brazen falsifiers and venal villains, the miserable tools of\r\nthe mine owners who, themselves, if anybody, deserve the gibbet.\r\n\r\nMoyer, Haywood and their comrades had no more to do with the\r\nassassination of Steunenberg than I had; the charge is a ghastly lie, a\r\ncriminal calumny, and is only an excuse to murder men who are too\r\nrigidly honest to betray their trust and too courageous to succumb to\r\nthreat and intimidation.\r\n\r\nLabor leaders that cringe before the plutocracy and do its bidding are\r\napotheosized; those that refuse must be foully murdered.\r\n\r\nPersonally and intimately do I know Moyer, Haywood, Pettibone, St. John\r\nand their official co-workers, and I will stake my life on their honor\r\nand integrity; and that is precisely the crime for which, according to\r\nthe words of the slimy “sleuth” who “worked up the case” against them,\r\n“they shall never leave Idaho alive.”\r\n\r\nWell, by the gods, if they don’t, the governors of Idaho and Colorado\r\nand their masters from Wall street, New York, to the Rocky Mountains had\r\nbetter prepare to follow them.\r\n\r\nNearly twenty years ago the capitalist tyrants put some innocent men to\r\ndeath for standing up for labor.\r\n\r\nThey are now going to try it again. Let them dare!\r\n\r\nThere have been twenty years of revolutionary education, agitation and\r\norganization since the Haymarket tragedy, and if an attempt is made to\r\nrepeat it, there will be a revolution and I will do all in my power to\r\nprecipitate it.\r\n\r\nThe crisis has come and we have got to meet it. Upon the issue involved\r\nthe whole body of organized labor can unite and every enemy of\r\nplutocracy will join us. From the farms, the factories and stores will\r\npour the workers to meet the redhanded destroyers of freedom, the\r\nmurderers of innocent men and the arch-enemies of the people.\r\n\r\nMoyer and Haywood are our comrades, staunch and true, and if we do not\r\nstand by them to the shedding of the last drop of blood in our veins, we\r\nare disgraced forever and deserve the fate of cringing cowards.\r\n\r\nWe are not responsible for the issue. It is not of our seeking. It has\r\nbeen forced upon us; and for the very reason that we deprecate violence\r\nand abhor bloodshed we cannot desert our comrades and allow them to be\r\nput to death. If they can be murdered without cause so can we, and so\r\nwill we be dealt with at the pleasure of these tyrants.\r\n\r\nThey have driven us to the wall and now let us rally our forces and face\r\nthem and fight.\r\n\r\nIf they attempt to murder Moyer, Haywood and their brothers, a million\r\nrevolutionists, at least, will meet them with guns.\r\n\r\nThey have done their best and their worst to crush and enslave us. Their\r\npoliticians have betrayed us, their courts have thrown us into jail\r\nwithout trial and their soldiers have shot our comrades dead in their\r\ntracks.\r\n\r\nThe worm turns at last, and so does the worker.\r\n\r\nLet them dare to execute their devilish plot and every state in this\r\nUnion will resound with the tramp of revolution.\r\n\r\nGet ready, comrades, for action! No other course is left to the working\r\nclass. Their courts are closed to us except to pronounce our doom. To\r\nenter their courts is simply to be mulcted of our meagre means and bound\r\nhand and foot; to have our eyes plucked out by the vultures that fatten\r\nupon our misery.\r\n\r\nCapitalist courts never have done, and never will do, anything for the\r\nworking class.\r\n\r\nWhatever is done we must do ourselves, and if we stand up like men from\r\nthe Atlantic to the Pacific and from Canada to the Gulf, we will strike\r\nterror to their cowardly hearts and they will be but too eager to relax\r\ntheir grip upon our throats and beat a swift retreat.\r\n\r\nWe will watch every move they make and in the meantime prepare for\r\naction.\r\n\r\nA special revolutionary convention of the proletariat at Chicago, or\r\nsome other central point, would be in order, and, if extreme measures\r\nare required, a general strike could be ordered and industry paralyzed\r\nas a preliminary to a general uprising.\r\n\r\nIf the plutocrats begin the program, we will end it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Growth of the Injunction\r\n\r\n                _Social Democratic Herald, May 6, 1905_\r\n\r\nIn the month of December, 1893, something over eleven years ago, a\r\nfederal injunction was issued that broke all the records up to that time\r\nand stirred up the whole country. This injunction was issued by James G.\r\nJenkins, judge of the United States Circuit Court, and restrained the\r\nemployes of the Northern Pacific railway from quitting the service of\r\nthat company under penalty of being found guilty of contempt and sent to\r\njail.\r\n\r\nThe facts in the case, which are recalled by a recently published\r\ninterview with Judge Jenkins, who has retired from the bench, were as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nThe Northern Pacific, robbed and wrecked by the knaves who had control\r\nof its affairs, applied to the federal court in the person of Judge\r\nJenkins for a receivership, which was promptly granted. Following this\r\norder of the court and the appointment of the receivers, the latter\r\npetitioned the court for an order making sweeping reductions in the\r\nwages of employes, and fearing that a strike might follow, the receivers\r\nasked the court at the same time to issue an order restraining the\r\nemployes from leaving the service of the company, and this was also\r\npromptly granted. It was this latter order that aroused the storm and it\r\nraged fiercely for some months. Indignation meetings were held by labor\r\nunions, notably in Chicago, where a mass meeting was called for the\r\nspecial purpose of denouncing Judge Jenkins and demanding his\r\nimpeachment. Obedient to the indignation and clamor of organized labor,\r\nCongressman McGann, of Illinois, introduced a resolution in Congress\r\nlooking to the investigation of the affair by the judiciary committee,\r\nbut, of course, nothing came from it, and it was not long before the\r\njudicial crime, for such it was, was forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe strange thing about it was that the employes did not strike under\r\nsuch extreme provocation, and this was due to the fact that their\r\nleaders, the national officers of the unions, urged them not to do so,\r\nand united in a letter to the general manager accepting the order of the\r\ncourt and acquiescing in the situation. The writer, who was then\r\norganizing the American Railway Union, tried to have the employes resent\r\nthe despotic decree of the court and quit in a body from end to end of\r\nthe line, but other counsels prevailed and they remained at work. It\r\nwould have been interesting to see the ten or twelve thousand employes\r\nquit as one and defy the outrageous order of the court, and then see\r\nJenkins make good his order and send them to jail. The judicial bluff\r\nwould have been called and not only would they not have gone to jail,\r\nbut the court would have stood exposed and rebuked and the reduction in\r\nthe wages would have been restored. I am still waiting for organized\r\nworkingmen to take advantage of just such an opening when ten thousand\r\nor more workers shall all be simultaneously in contempt for the defiance\r\nof some outrageous federal injunction. It will have a most wholesome\r\neffect—infinitely better than the servile pleas of labor leaders and\r\nlegislative committees in the humiliating role of mendicants, crawling\r\nin the dust at the feet of their supposed servants.\r\n\r\nHad the army of Northern Pacific employes resented the outrage of Judge\r\nJenkins in 1893 by quitting in defiance of his injunction—and they would\r\nhave done it but for the national officers of their unions—an object\r\nlesson of inestimable value would have been taught the courts and their\r\ncapitalist masters, and the rapid evolution of the labor injunction\r\nwhich had then fairly set in would have been checked for a time at\r\nleast, and it is doubtful if it had ever developed its present\r\nunrestrained restraining power.\r\n\r\nJudge Henry Clay Caldwell, who was also on the federal bench at the time\r\nthe Jenkins injunction was issued, declared strongly in opposition to\r\nit, saying:\r\n\r\n“If receivers should apply for leave to reduce the existing scale of\r\nwages, before acting on their petition I would require them to give\r\nnotice of the application to the officers or representatives of the\r\nseveral labor organizations to be affected by the proposed change, of\r\nthe time and place of hearing, and would also require them to grant such\r\nofficers or representatives leave of absence and furnish them\r\ntransportation to the place of hearing and subsistence while in\r\nattendance, and I would hear both sides in person, or by attorneys, if\r\nthey wanted attorneys to appear for them. * * * If, after a full hearing\r\nand consideration, I found that it was necessary, equitable and just to\r\nreduce the scale of wages, I would give the employes ample time to\r\ndetermine whether they would accept the new scale. If they rejected it\r\nthey would not be enjoined from quitting the service of the court either\r\nsingly or in a body.”\r\n\r\nJudge Jenkins gave the employes no hearing, no notice, no consideration.\r\nHe simply ordered their wages reduced and told them that if they quit\r\nwork he would send them to jail. This is the order—and a beautiful order\r\nit is in a land of boasted freedom—that Judge Jenkins now says has been\r\nvindicated and that the precedent then established by him is now\r\nfollowed by all courts. He is right. The evolution of the injunction has\r\nindeed been swift and what was regarded as exceedingly novel and\r\nventuresome a decade ago is now securely incorporated in our established\r\nsystem of capitalistic jurisprudence.\r\n\r\nThe late Judge Dundy, of Omaha, notoriously the creature of the Union\r\nPacific, issued the order reducing wages on that system when it was in\r\nthe hands of receivers appointed by him, but Judge Caldwell, who was on\r\nthe Circuit bench and had prior jurisdiction, took the case away from\r\nDundy, had the employes come into court and be heard, and, after hearing\r\nall the evidence, revoked the order of Dundy, restored the wage\r\nreductions and administered a scathing rebuke to the receivers.\r\n\r\nJudge Caldwell was appointed to the Federal bench by President Lincoln.\r\nThey don’t appoint that kind of judges any more.\r\n\r\nSuch eminent lights as Dundy, Jenkins, Ricks, Taft, Ross, Woods,\r\nGrosscup and Kohlsaat now illumine the Federal bar and all their names\r\nare immortally associated with the evolution of the injunction and the\r\nsubjugation of labor by judicial prowess.\r\n\r\nOne of the first and most illustrious in this line is Judge Taft, who\r\nwon his spurs in the Toledo, Ann Arbor & North Michigan case. He has\r\nbeen a prime favorite with the corporations ever since, is now in the\r\ncabinet, and is being groomed for the presidency. As a candidate for the\r\nwhite house he has the two essential qualifications—unswerving loyalty\r\nto capital and unmitigated contempt for labor—and this should and\r\ndoubtless will secure his nomination and election by an overwhelming\r\nmajority.\r\n\r\nIn his published interview, Judge Jenkins, discussing his Northern\r\nPacific injunction, says:\r\n\r\n“Within the last twelve years, by reason of popular discontent at legal\r\nrestraint, the issuance of this writ has been designated opprobriously\r\nas ‘government by injunction.’ Well, it is in a true and proper sense\r\n‘government by injunction,’ for it is a government by law. The remedy\r\nhas long existed and will exist so long as government by law continues,\r\nso long as we have liberty regulated by law, and not irresponsible,\r\nuncontrolled license to exercise one’s sweet will without regard to\r\nothers’ rights, which is anarchy, and no howling of the mob can ever\r\nabolish it until government by law is wrecked and ‘chaos is come\r\nagain.’”\r\n\r\nLet me ask Judge Jenkins if he would be of the same opinion if at the\r\ntime he cut the wages of the Northern Pacific employes and restrained\r\nthem from quitting some other judge had issued an order reducing his\r\nsalary as judge and restraining him from resigning under penalty of\r\nbeing sent to jail. That is the position precisely in which he placed\r\nthe employes of the Northern Pacific, and it is this that he now calls\r\n“liberty regulated by law.” If that is liberty it would be interesting\r\nto know what slavery is.\r\n\r\nIt has been about fifteen years since the court injunction began to\r\nfigure in labor affairs. It was threatened in the C., B. & Q. railroad\r\nstrike of 1888, but not resorted to. After the Homestead strike, in\r\n1892, during which Pinkertonism reached its culmination and this brutal\r\nform of warfare upon labor by Carnegie and Frick excited the most\r\nintense indignation, the injunction came into general use. It proved a\r\ngreat thing for the corporations, just what they had been looking for.\r\nNo longer was there any need for a private Pinkerton army. That was a\r\nclumsy contrivance compared to the noiseless, automatic, self-acting\r\ninjunction. The Pinkertons were expensive, cumbersome, aroused hatred\r\nand sometimes missed fire. The injunction was free from all these\r\nobjections. One shock from the judicial battery and labor was paralyzed\r\nand counted out.\r\n\r\nSince first introduced in the struggle between labor and capital the\r\ninjunction has developed from the flintlock to the rapidfire. Judge\r\nJenkins enjoys in his retirement the distinction of having contributed\r\none of its chief improvements. His fame is secure and so is his infamy.\r\nHe need not worry about vindication. He was as loyal a judge as ever\r\nbowed to Mammon, as faithful a tool as ever served his master, and as\r\nconsummate a hypocrite as ever stabbed liberty in the name of law.\r\n\r\nThe injunction is playing its usual role in the teamsters’ strike in\r\nChicago. The Team Owners’ Association of Chicago are incorporated in\r\nWest Virginia and by this trick become an interstate association and\r\nnestled under the wing of the United States court. The Federal\r\ninjunction to destroy the strike and rout the strikers has already been\r\napplied for and granted. This goes without saying. What are Judges\r\nGrosscup and Kohlsaat on the bench for? Certainly not for the health of\r\nthe teamsters. They are there to do what they were appointed to do by\r\nthe president of the exploiting capitalists elected by the exploited\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\nAt this writing carloads of negroes are being shipped into Chicago to\r\ntake the places of the striking teamsters, while injunctions, like\r\nswords suspended by threads, hang above their heads and ten thousand\r\nregular soldiers with shotted guns are on the edge of the city awaiting\r\nthe command to sprinkle the streets with the blood of labor.\r\n\r\nOh, that all the workers of Chicago would back up the teamsters and\r\ngarment workers by throwing down their tools and quitting work!\r\nTwenty-four hours of such a strike would bring the masters to their\r\nknees. But they have too many unions and too many leaders for this, and\r\nso they must fight it out to the bitter end.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the evolution of the injunction is making for Socialism.\r\nNothing more clearly shows that the labor question is also a political\r\nquestion and that to conquer their exploiters the working class must\r\nbuild up the Socialist party and capture the powers of government.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    What’s the Matter with Chicago?\r\n\r\n                 _Chicago Socialist, October 25, 1902_\r\n\r\nFor some days William E. Curtis, the far-famed correspondent of the\r\nChicago _Record-Herald_, has been pressing the above inquiry upon\r\nrepresentative people of all classes with a view to throwing all\r\npossible light upon that vexed subject.\r\n\r\nThe inquiry is in such general terms and takes such wide scope that\r\nanything like a comprehensive answer would fill a book without\r\nexhausting the subject, while a review of the “interviews” would embrace\r\nthe whole gamut of absurdity and folly and produce a library of comedy\r\nand tragedy.\r\n\r\nNot one of the replies I have seen has sufficient merit to be printed in\r\na paper read by grown folks, and those that purport to come from leaders\r\nof labor and representatives of the working class take the prize in what\r\nwould appear to be a competitive contest for progressive asininity.\r\n\r\nThe leader, so-called, who puts it upon record in a capitalist paper and\r\ngives the libel the widest circulation, that Chicago is alright, so far\r\nas the workers are concerned, that they have plenty and are prosperous\r\nand happy, is as fit to lead the working class as is a wolf to guide a\r\nflock of spring lambs.\r\n\r\nIt is from the wage worker’s point of view that I shall attempt an\r\nanswer to the question propounded by Mr. Curtis, and in dealing with the\r\nsubject I shall be as candid as may be expected from a Socialist\r\nagitator.\r\n\r\nThe question is opportune at this season, when the “frost is on the\r\npumpkin,” and the ballot is soon to decide to what extent the people\r\nreally know “What is the matter with Chicago.”\r\n\r\nFirst of all, Chicago is the product of modern capitalism, and, like all\r\nother great commercial centers, is unfit for human habitation. The\r\nIllinois Central Railroad Company selected the site upon which the city\r\nis built and this consisted of a vast miasmatic swamp far better suited\r\nto mosquito culture than for human beings. From the day the site was\r\nchosen by (and of course in the interest of all) said railway company,\r\neverything that entered into the building of the town and the\r\ndevelopment of the city was determined purely from profit considerations\r\nand without the remotest concern for the health and comfort of the human\r\nbeings who were to live there, especially those who had to do all the\r\nlabor and produce all the wealth.\r\n\r\nAs a rule hogs are only raised where they have good health and grow fat.\r\nAny old place will do to raise human beings.\r\n\r\nAt this very hour typhoid fever and diphtheria are epidemic in Chicago\r\nand the doctors agree that these ravages are due to the microbes and\r\ngerms generated in the catchbasins and sewers which fester and exhale\r\ntheir foul and fetid breath upon the vast swarms of human beings caught\r\nand fettered there.\r\n\r\nThousands upon thousands of Chicago’s population have been poisoned to\r\ndeath by the impure water and foul atmosphere of this undrainable swamp\r\n(notwithstanding the doctored mortuary tables by which it is proven to\r\nprospective investors that it is the healthiest city on earth) and\r\nthousands more will commit suicide in the same way, but to compensate\r\nfor it all Chicago has the prize location for money-making, immense\r\nadvantage for profitmongering—and what are human beings compared to\r\nmoney?\r\n\r\nDuring recent years Chicago has expended millions to lift herself out of\r\nher native swamp, but the sewage floats back to report the dismal\r\nfailure of the attempt, and every germ-laden breeze confirms the report.\r\n\r\nThat is one thing that is the matter with Chicago. It never was intended\r\nthat human beings should live there. A thousand sites infinitely\r\npreferable for a city could have been found in close proximity, but they\r\nlacked the “Commercial” advantages which are of such commanding\r\nimportance in the capitalist system.\r\n\r\nAnd now they wonder “What is the Matter with Chicago!” Look at some of\r\nher filthy streets in the heart of the city, chronically torn up, the\r\nsunlight obscured, the air polluted, the water contaminated, every\r\nfountain and stream designed to bless the race poisoned at its\r\nsource—and you need not wonder what ails Chicago, nor will you escape\r\nthe conclusion that the case is chronic and that the present city will\r\nnever recover from the fatal malady.\r\n\r\nWhat is true of Chicago physically is emphasized in her social, moral\r\nand spiritual aspects, and this applies to every commercial metropolis\r\nin the civilized world.\r\n\r\nFrom any rational point of view they are all dismal failures.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason under the sun, aside from the profit considerations\r\nof the capitalist system, why two million humans should be stacked up in\r\nlayers and heaps until they jar the clouds, while millions of acres of\r\nvirgin soil are totally uninhabited.\r\n\r\nThe very contemplation of the spectacle gives rise to serious doubt as\r\nto the sanity of the race.\r\n\r\nSuch a vast population in such a limited area cannot feed itself, has\r\nnot room to move and cannot keep clean.\r\n\r\nThe deadly virus of capitalism is surging through all the veins of this\r\nyoung mistress of trade and the eruptions are found all over the body\r\nsocial and politic, and that’s “What’s the matter with Chicago.”\r\n\r\nHundreds of the _Record-Herald’s_ quacks are prescribing their nostrums\r\nfor the blotches and pustules which have broken out upon the surface,\r\nbut few have sense enough to know and candor enough to admit that the\r\nvirus must be expelled from the system—and these few are Socialists who\r\nare so notoriously visionary and impracticable that their opinions are\r\nnot worthy of space in a great paper printed to conserve the truth and\r\npromote the welfare of society.\r\n\r\nThis model metropolis of the West has broken all the records for\r\npolitical corruption. Her old rival on the Mississippi, catching the\r\ninspiration doubtless, has been making some effort to crown herself with\r\nsimilar laurels, but for smooth political jobbery and fancy manipulation\r\nof the wires, Chicago is still far in the lead. In the “Windy City” ward\r\npolitics has long been recognized as a fine art and the collection is\r\nunrivalled anywhere.\r\n\r\nFrom the millions of dollars filched from the millions of humans by\r\nthe corporate owners of the common utilities, the reeking corruption\r\nfunds flow like lava tides, and to attempt to purify the turbid stream\r\nby the “reform measures” proposed from time to time by the\r\nRepublican-Democratic party in its internal conflict for the spoils of\r\noffice, is as utter a piece of folly as to try with beeswax to seal up\r\nMount Pelee.\r\n\r\nChicago has plutocrats and paupers in the ratio of more than sixteen to\r\none—boulevards for the exhibition of the rich and alleys for the\r\nconvenience of the poor.\r\n\r\nChicago has also a grand army of the most skilled pickpockets, artistic\r\nconfidence operators, accomplished foot-pads and adept cracksmen on\r\nearth. So well is this understood that on every breeze we hear the\r\nrefrain:\r\n\r\n                      “When Reuben comes to town,\r\n                      He’s sure to be done brown—”\r\n\r\nAnd this lugubrious truth is treated as the richest of jokes, with utter\r\nunconsciousness of the moral degeneracy it reflects, the crime it\r\nglorifies and the indictment of capitalist society it returns in answer\r\nto the _Record-Herald’s_ query: “What’s the matter with Chicago”?\r\n\r\nBesides the array of “talent” above mentioned, fostered by competitive\r\nsociety everywhere, the marshy metropolis by the lake may boast of a\r\nvast and flourishing gambling industry, an illimitable and progressive\r\n“levee” district, sweatshops, slums, dives, bloated men, bedraggled\r\nwomen, ghastly caricatures of their former selves, babies cradled in\r\nrags and filth, aged children, than which nothing could be more\r\nmelancholy—all these and a thousand more, the fruit of our present\r\nsocial anarchy, afflict Chicago; and worst of all, our wise social\r\nphilosophers, schooled in the economics of capitalist universities,\r\npreach the comforting doctrine that all these are necessary evils and at\r\nbest can but be restricted within certain bounds; and this hideous libel\r\nis made a cloak that theft may continue to masquerade as philanthropy.\r\n\r\nIt is at this point that Chicago particularly prides herself upon her\r\n“charities,” hospitals and eleemosynary endowments, all breathing the\r\nsweet spirit of Christian philanthropy—utterly ignorant of the fact,\r\ndesignedly or otherwise, that these very institutions are manifestations\r\nof social disease and are monumental of the iniquity of the system that\r\nmust rear such whited sepulchres to conceal its crimes.\r\n\r\nI do not oppose the insane asylum—but I abhor and condemn the cut-throat\r\nsystem that robs man of his reason, drives him to insanity and makes the\r\nlunatic asylum an indispensable adjunct to every civilized community.\r\n\r\nWith the ten thousand “charities” that are proposed to poultice the\r\nsores and bruises of society, I have little patience.\r\n\r\nWorst of all is the charity ball. Chicago indulges in these festering\r\nfestivals on a grand scale.\r\n\r\nThink of cavorting around in a dress suit because some poor wretch is\r\nhungry; and of indulging in a royal carousal to comfort some despairing\r\nwoman on the brink of suicide; and finally, that in “fashionable\r\nsociety” the definition of this mixture of inanity and moral perversion\r\nis “charity.”\r\n\r\nFleece your fellows! That is “business,” and you are a captain of\r\nindustry. Having “relieved” your victims of their pelts, dance and make\r\nmerry to “relieve” their agony. This is “charity” and you are a\r\nphilanthropist.\r\n\r\nIn summing up the moral assets of a great (?) city, the churches should\r\nnot be overlooked. Chicago is a city of fine churches. All the\r\ndenominations are copiously represented, and sermons in all languages\r\nand of all varieties are turned out in job lots and at retail to suit\r\nthe market.\r\n\r\nThe churches are always numerous where vice is rampant. They seem to\r\nspring from the same soil and thrive in the same climate.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the churches are supposed to wage relentless warfare upon evil.\r\nTo just what extent they have checked its spread in the “Windy City” may\r\nbe inferred from the probing of the press into the body social to\r\nascertain “What is the Matter with Chicago.”\r\n\r\nThe preachers are not wholly to blame, after all, for their moral and\r\nspiritual impotency. They are wage-workers, the same as coal miners, and\r\nare just as dependent upon the capitalist class. How can they be\r\nexpected to antagonize the interests of their employers and hold their\r\njobs? The unskilled preachers, the common laborers in the arid spots of\r\nthe vineyard, are often wretchedly paid, and yet they remain unorganized\r\nand have never struck for better wages.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter with Chicago”? Capitalism!\r\n\r\nWhat’s the cure? Socialism!\r\n\r\nRegeneration will only come with depopulation—when Socialism has\r\nrelieved the congestion and released the people and they spread out over\r\nthe country and live close to the grass.\r\n\r\nThe _Record-Herald_ has furnished the people of Chicago and Illinois\r\nwith a campaign issue.\r\n\r\nIf you want to know more about “What is the matter with Chicago,” read\r\nthe Socialist papers and magazines; read the platform of the Socialist\r\nparty; and if you do, you will cut loose from the Republican-Democratic\r\nparty, the double-headed political monstrosity of the capitalist class,\r\nand you will cast your vote for the Socialist party and your lot with\r\nthe International Socialist Movement, whose mission it is to uproot and\r\noverthrow the whole system of capitalist exploitation, and put an end to\r\nthe poverty and misery it entails—and that’s “What’s the matter with\r\nChicago.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                SPEECHES\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Liberty\r\n\r\n   _Speech at Battery D, Chicago, on his release from Woodstock Jail,\r\n                          November 22, 1895._\r\n\r\nManifestly the spirit of ’76 still survives. The fires of liberty and\r\nnoble aspirations are not yet extinguished. I greet you tonight as\r\nlovers of liberty and as despisers of despotism. I comprehend the\r\nsignificance of this demonstration and appreciate the honor that makes\r\nit possible for me to be your guest on such an occasion. The vindication\r\nand glorification of American principles of government, as proclaimed to\r\nthe world in the Declaration of Independence, is the high purpose of\r\nthis convocation.\r\n\r\nSpeaking for myself personally, I am not certain whether this is an\r\noccasion for rejoicing or lamentation. I confess to a serious doubt as\r\nto whether this day marks my deliverance from bondage to freedom or my\r\ndoom from freedom to bondage. Certain it is, in the light of recent\r\njudicial proceedings, that I stand in your presence stripped of my\r\nconstitutional rights as a freeman and shorn of the most sacred\r\nprerogatives of American citizenship, and what is true of myself is true\r\nof every other citizen who has the temerity to protest against\r\ncorporation rule or question the absolute sway of the money power. It is\r\nnot law nor the administration of law of which I complain. It is the\r\nflagrant violation of the constitution, the total abrogation of law and\r\nthe usurpation of judicial and despotic power, by virtue of which my\r\ncolleagues and myself were committed to jail, against which I enter my\r\nsolemn protest; and any honest analysis of the proceedings must sustain\r\nthe haggard truth of the indictment.\r\n\r\nIn a letter recently written by the venerable Judge Trumbull that\r\neminent jurist says: “The doctrine announced by the supreme court in the\r\nDebs case, carried to its logical conclusion, places every citizen at\r\nthe mercy of any prejudiced or malicious federal judge who may think\r\nproper to imprison him.” This is the deliberate conclusion of one of the\r\npurest, ablest and most distinguished judges the Republic has produced.\r\nThe authority of Judge Trumbull upon this question will not be impeached\r\nby anyone whose opinions are not deformed or debauched.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture I deem it proper to voice my demands for a trial by a\r\njury of my peers. At the instigation of the railroad corporations\r\ncentering here in Chicago I was indicted for conspiracy and I insist\r\nupon being tried as to my innocence or guilt. It will be remembered that\r\nthe trial last winter terminated very abruptly on account of a sick\r\njuror. It was currently reported at the time that this was merely a\r\npretext to abandon the trial and thus defeat the vindication of a\r\nfavorable verdict, which seemed inevitable, and which would have been in\r\npainfully embarrassing contrast with the sentence previously pronounced\r\nby Judge Woods in substantially the same case. Whether this be true or\r\nnot, I do not know. I do know, however, that I have been denied a trial,\r\nand here and now I demand a hearing of my case. I am charged with\r\nconspiracy to commit a crime, and if guilty I should go to the\r\npenitentiary. All I ask is a fair trial and no favor. If the counsel for\r\nthe government, alias the railroads, have been correctly quoted in the\r\npress, the case against me is “not to be pressed,” as they “do not wish\r\nto appear in the light of persecuting the defendants.” I repel with\r\nscorn their professed mercy. Simple justice is the demand. I am not\r\ndisposed to shrink from the fullest responsibility for my acts. I have\r\nhad time for meditation and reflection and I have no hesitancy in\r\ndeclaring that under the same circumstances I would pursue precisely the\r\nsame policy. So far as my acts are concerned, I have neither apology nor\r\nregrets.\r\n\r\nDismissing this branch of the subject, permit me to assure you that I am\r\nnot here to bemoan my lot. In my vocabulary there are no wails of\r\ndespondency or despair. However gloomy the future may appear to others,\r\nI have an abiding faith in the ultimate triumph of the right. My heart\r\nresponds to the sentiments of the poet who says:\r\n\r\n              “Swing back today, O prison gate,\r\n                O winds, stream out the stripes and stars,\r\n              O men, once more in high debate\r\n                Denounce injunction rule and czars.\r\n              By Freedom’s travail pangs we swear\r\n              That slavery’s chains we will not wear.\r\n\r\n              “Ring joyously, O prison bell,\r\n                O iron tongue, the truth proclaim;\r\n              O winds and lightnings, speed to tell\r\n                That ours is not a czar’s domain.\r\n              By all the oracles divine\r\n              We pledge defense of Freedom’s shrine.\r\n\r\n              “O freemen true! O sons of sires!\r\n                O sons of men who dared to die!\r\n              O fan to life old Freedom’s fires\r\n                And light with glory Freedom’s sky.\r\n              Then swear by God’s eternal throne,\r\n              America shall be Freedom’s home.\r\n\r\n              “O workingmen! O Labor’s hosts!\r\n                O men of courage, heart and will;\r\n              O far and wide send Labor’s toasts\r\n                Till every heart feels Freedom’s thrill,\r\n              And freemen’s shouts like billows roar\r\n              O’er all the land from shore to shore.”\r\n\r\nLiberty is not a word of modern coinage. Liberty and slavery are primal\r\nwords, like good and evil, right and wrong; they are opposites and\r\ncoexistent.\r\n\r\nThere has been no liberty in the world since the gift, like sunshine and\r\nrain, came down from heaven, for the maintenance of which man has not\r\nbeen required to fight, and man’s complete degradation is secured only\r\nwhen subjugation and slavery have sapped him of the last spark of the\r\nnoble attributes of his nature and reduced him to the unresisting\r\ninertness of a clod.\r\n\r\nThe theme tonight is personal liberty; or giving it its full height,\r\ndepth and breadth, American liberty, something that Americans have been\r\naccustomed to eulogize since the foundation of the Republic, and\r\nmultiplied thousands of them continue in the habit to this day because\r\nthey do not recognize the truth that in the imprisonment of one man in\r\ndefiance of all constitutional guarantees, the liberties of all are\r\ninvaded and placed in peril. In saying this, I conjecture I have struck\r\nthe keynote of alarm that has convoked this vast audience.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in the records of all the ages, the inalienable\r\nrights of man, “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,” were\r\nproclaimed July 4, 1776.\r\n\r\nIt was then that crowns, sceptres, thrones and the divine right of kings\r\nto rule sunk together and man expanded to glorious liberty and\r\nsovereignty. It was then that the genius of Liberty, speaking to all men\r\nin the commanding voice of Eternal Truth, bade them assert their\r\nheaven-decreed prerogatives and emancipate themselves from bondage. It\r\nwas a proclamation countersigned by the Infinite—and man stood forth the\r\ncoronated sovereign of the world, free as the tides that flow, free as\r\nthe winds that blow, and on that primal morning when creation was\r\ncomplete, the morning stars and the sons of God, in anthem chorus, sang\r\nthe song of Liberty.\r\n\r\nIt may be a fancy, but within the limitless boundaries of the\r\nimagination I can conceive of no other theme more appropriate to weave\r\ninto the harmonies of Freedom. The Creator had surveyed his work and\r\npronounced it good, but nothing can be called good in human affairs with\r\nliberty eliminated. As well talk of air without nitrogen, or water\r\nwithout oxygen, as of goodness without liberty.\r\n\r\nIt does not matter that the Creator has sown with stars the fields of\r\nether and decked the earth with countless beauties for man’s enjoyment.\r\nIt does not matter that air and ocean teem with the wonders of\r\ninnumerable forms of life to challenge man’s admiration and\r\ninvestigation. It does not matter that nature spreads forth all her\r\nscenes of beauty and gladness and pours forth the melodies of her\r\nmyriad-tongued voices for man’s delectation. If liberty is ostracized\r\nand exiled, man is a slave, and the world rolls in space and whirls\r\naround the sun a gilded prison, a doomed dungeon, and though painted in\r\nall the enchanting hues that infinite art could command, it must still\r\nstand forth a blotch amidst the shining spheres of the sidereal heavens,\r\nand those who cull from the vocabularies of nations, living or dead,\r\ntheir flashing phrases with which to apostrophize Liberty, are engaged\r\nin perpetuating the most stupendous delusion the ages have known. Strike\r\ndown liberty, no matter by what subtle and infernal art the deed is\r\ndone, the spinal cord of humanity is sundered and the world is paralyzed\r\nby the indescribable crime.\r\n\r\nStrike the fetters from the slave, give him liberty and he becomes an\r\ninhabitant of a new world. He looks abroad and beholds life and joy in\r\nall things around him. His soul expands beyond all boundaries.\r\nEmancipated by the genius of Liberty, he aspires to communion with all\r\nthat is noble and beautiful, feels himself allied to all the higher\r\norder of intelligences, and walks abroad, redeemed from animalism,\r\nignorance and superstition, a new being throbbing with glorious life.\r\n\r\nWhat pen or tongue from primeval man to the loftiest intellect of the\r\npresent generation has been able to fittingly anathematize the more than\r\nsatanic crime of stealing the jewel of liberty from the crown of manhood\r\nand reducing the victim of the burglary to slavery or to prison, to\r\ngratify those monsters of iniquity who for some inscrutable reason are\r\ngiven breath to contaminate the atmosphere and poison every fountain and\r\nstream designed to bless the world!\r\n\r\nIt may be questioned if such interrogatories are worth the time required\r\nto state them, and I turn from their consideration to the actualities of\r\nmy theme. As Americans, we have boasted of our liberties and continue to\r\nboast of them. They were once the nation’s glory, and, if some have\r\nvanished, it may be well to remember that a remnant still remains. Out\r\nof prison, beyond the limits of Russian injunctions, out of reach of a\r\ndeputy marshal’s club, above the throttling clutch of corporations and\r\nthe enslaving power of plutocracy, out of range of the government’s\r\nmachine guns and knowing the location of judicial traps and deadfalls,\r\nAmericans may still indulge in the exaltation of liberty, though pursued\r\nthrough every lane and avenue of life by the baying hounds of usurped\r\nand unconstitutional power, glad if when night lets down her sable\r\ncurtains, they are out of prison, though still the wage-slaves of a\r\nplutocracy which, were it in the celestial city, would wreck every\r\navenue leading up to the throne of the Infinite by stealing the gold\r\nwith which they are paved, and debauch Heaven’s supreme court to obtain\r\na decision that the command “thou shalt not steal” is unconstitutional.\r\n\r\nLiberty, be it known, is for those only who dare strike the blow to\r\nsecure and retain the priceless boon. It has been written that the “love\r\nof liberty with life is given” and that life itself is an inferior gift;\r\nthat with liberty exiled life is a continuous curse and that “an hour of\r\nliberty is worth an eternity of bondage.” It would be an easy task to\r\nlink together gilded periods extolling liberty until the mind, weary\r\nwith delight, becomes oblivious of the fact that while dreaming of\r\nsecurity, the blessings we magnified had, one by one, and little by\r\nlittle, disappeared, emphasizing the truth of the maxim that “eternal\r\nvigilance is the price of liberty.”\r\n\r\nIs it worth while to iterate that all men are created free and that\r\nslavery and bondage are in contravention of the Creator’s decree and\r\nhave their origin in man’s depravity?\r\n\r\nIf liberty is a birthright which has been wrested from the weak by the\r\nstrong, or has been placed in peril by those who were commissioned to\r\nguard it as Gheber priests watch the sacred fires they worship, what is\r\nto be done? Leaving all other nations, kindred and tongues out of the\r\nquestion, what is the duty of Americans? Above all, what is the duty of\r\nAmerican workingmen whose liberties have been placed in peril? They are\r\nnot hereditary bondsmen. Their fathers were free born—their sovereignty\r\nnone denied and their children yet have the ballot. It has been called\r\n“a weapon that executes a free man’s will as lighting does the will of\r\nGod.” It is a metaphor pregnant with life and truth. There is nothing in\r\nour government it can not remove or amend. It can make and unmake\r\npresidents and congresses and courts. It can abolish unjust laws and\r\nconsign to eternal odium and oblivion unjust judges, strip from them\r\ntheir robes and gowns and send them forth unclean as lepers to bear the\r\nburden of merited obloquy as Cain with the mark of a murderer. It can\r\nsweep away trusts, syndicates, corporations, monopolies, and every other\r\nabnormal development of the money power designed to abridge the\r\nliberties of workingmen and enslave them by the degradation incident to\r\npoverty and enforced idleness, as cyclones scatter the leaves of the\r\nforest. The ballot can do all this and more. It can give our\r\ncivilization its crowning glory—the co-operative commonwealth.\r\n\r\nTo the unified hosts of American workingmen fate has committed the\r\ncharge of rescuing American liberties from the grasp of the vandal horde\r\nthat have placed them in peril, by seizing the ballot and wielding it to\r\nregain the priceless heritage and to preserve and transmit it without\r\nscar or blemish to the generations yet to come.\r\n\r\n                 “Snatch from the ashes of their sires\r\n                   The embers of their former fires,\r\n                 And he who in the strife expires\r\n                   Will add to theirs a name of fear\r\n                   That Tyranny shall quake to hear.”\r\n\r\nStanding before you tonight re-clothed in theory at least with the\r\nprerogatives of a free man, in the midst of free men, what more natural,\r\nwhat more in consonance with the proprieties of the occasion, than to\r\nrefer to the incarceration of myself and associate officials of the\r\nAmerican Railway Union in the county jail at Woodstock?\r\n\r\nI have no ambition to avail myself of this occasion to be sensational,\r\nor to thrust my fellow prisoners and myself into prominence. My theme\r\nexpands to proportions which obscure the victims of judicial tyranny,\r\nand yet, regardless of reluctance, it so happens by the decree of\r\ncircumstances, that personal references are unavoidable. To wish it\r\notherwise would be to deplore the organization of the American Railway\r\nUnion and every effort that great organization has made to extend a\r\nhelping hand to oppressed, robbed, suffering and starving men, women and\r\nchildren, the victims of corporate greed and rapacity. It would be to\r\nbewail every lofty attribute of human nature, lament the existence of\r\nthe golden rule and wish the world were a jungle, inhabited by beasts of\r\nprey, that the seas were peopled with sharks and devil-fish and that\r\nbetween the earth and the stars only vultures held winged sway.\r\n\r\nThe American Railway Union was born with a sympathetic soul. Its ears\r\nwere attuned to the melodies of mercy, to catch the whispered wailings\r\nof the oppressed. It had eyes to scan the fields of labor, a tongue to\r\ndenounce the wrong, hands to grasp the oppressed and a will to lift them\r\nout of the sloughs of despondency to highlands of security and\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  WOODSTOCK JAIL, IN WHICH DEBS WAS CONFINED\r\n]\r\n\r\nHere and now I challenge the records, and if in all the land the\r\nAmerican Railway Union has an enemy, one or a million, I challenge them\r\nall to stand up before the labor world and give a reason why they have\r\nmaligned and persecuted the order. I am not here to assert the\r\ninfallibility of the organization or its officials, or to claim\r\nexemption from error. But I am here to declare to every friend of\r\nAmerican toilers, regardless of banner, name or craft, that if the\r\nAmerican Railway Union has erred, it has been on the side of sympathy,\r\nmercy and humanity—zeal in a great cause, devotion to the spirit of\r\nbrotherhood which knows no artificial boundaries, whose zones are mapped\r\nby lines of truth as vivid as lightning, and whose horizon is measured\r\nonly by the eye of faith in man’s redemption from slavery.\r\n\r\nI hold it to have been inconceivable that an organization of workingmen,\r\nanimated by such inspirations and aspirations, should have become the\r\ntarget for the shafts of judicial and governmental malice.\r\n\r\nBut the fact that such was the case brings into haggard prominence a\r\ncondition of affairs that appeals to all thoughtful men in the ranks of\r\norganized labor and all patriotic citizens, regardless of vocation, who\r\nnote the subtle invasions of the liberties of the American people by the\r\ncourts, sustained by an administration that is equally dead to the\r\nguarantees of the constitution.\r\n\r\nIt is in no spirit of laudation that I aver here tonight that it has\r\nfallen to the lot of the American Railway Union to arouse workingmen to\r\na sense of the perils that environ their liberties.\r\n\r\nIn the great Pullman strike the American Railway Union challenged the\r\npower of corporations in a way that had not previously been done, and\r\nthe analyzation of this fact serves to expand it to proportions that the\r\nmost conservative men of the nation regard with alarm.\r\n\r\nIt must be borne in mind that the American Railway Union did not\r\nchallenge the government. It threw down no gauntlet to courts or\r\narmies—it simply resisted the invasion of the rights of workingmen by\r\ncorporations. It challenged and defied the power of corporations. Thrice\r\narmed with a just cause, the organization believed that justice would\r\nwin for labor a notable victory, and the records proclaim that its\r\nconfidence was not misplaced.\r\n\r\nThe corporations, left to their own resources of money, mendacity and\r\nmalice, of thugs and ex-convicts, leeches and lawyers, would have been\r\noverwhelmed with defeat and the banners of organized labor would have\r\nfloated triumphant in the breeze.\r\n\r\nThis the corporations saw and believed—hence the crowning act of infamy\r\nin which the federal courts and the federal armies participated, and\r\nwhich culminated in the defeat of labor.\r\n\r\nHad this been all, the simple defeat of a labor organization, however\r\ndisrupted and despoiled, this grand convocation of the lovers of liberty\r\nwould never have been heard of. The robbed, idle and blacklisted victims\r\nof defeat would have suffered in silence in their darkened homes amidst\r\nthe sobbings and wailings of wives and children. It would have been the\r\noft repeated old, old story, heard along the track of progress and\r\npoverty for three-quarters of a century in the United States, where\r\nbrave men, loyal to law and duty, have struck to better their condition\r\nor to resist degradation, and have gone down in defeat. But the defeat\r\nof the American Railway Union involved questions of law, constitution\r\nand government which, all things considered, are without a parallel in\r\ncourt and governmental proceedings under the constitution of the\r\nRepublic. And it is this judicial and administrative usurpation of power\r\nto override the rights of states and strike down the liberties of the\r\npeople that has conferred upon the incidents connected with the Pullman\r\nstrike such commanding importance as to attract the attention of men of\r\nthe highest attainments in constitutional law and of statesmen who, like\r\nJefferson, view with alarm the processes by which the Republic is being\r\nwrecked and a despotism reared upon its ruins.\r\n\r\nI have said that in the great battle of labor fought in 1894 between the\r\nAmerican Railway Union and the Corporations banded together under the\r\nname of the “General Managers’ Association,” victory would have perched\r\nupon the standards of labor if the battle had been left to these\r\ncontending forces—and this statement, which has been verified and\r\nestablished beyond truthful contradiction, suggests the inquiry, what\r\nother resources had the corporations aside from their money and the\r\nstrength which their federation conferred?\r\n\r\nIn replying to the question, I am far within the limits of accepted\r\nfacts when I say the country stood amazed as the corporations put forth\r\ntheir latent powers to debauch such departments of the government as\r\nwere required to defeat labor in the greatest struggle for the right\r\nthat was ever chronicled in the United States.\r\n\r\nDefeated at every point, their plans all frustrated, outgeneraled in\r\ntactics and strategy, while the hopes of labor were brightening and\r\nvictory was in sight, the corporations, goaded to desperation, played\r\ntheir last card in the game of oppression by an appeal to the federal\r\njudiciary and to the federal administration. To this appeal the response\r\ncame quick as lightning from a storm cloud. It was an exhibition of the\r\ndebauching power of money which the country had never before beheld.\r\n\r\nThe people had long been familiar with such expressions as “money\r\ntalks,” “money rules,” and they had seen the effects of its power in\r\nlegislatures and in congress. They were conversant with Jay Gould’s\r\nmethods of gaining his legal victories by “buying a judge” in critical\r\ncases. They had tracked this money power, this behemoth beast of prey,\r\ninto every corporate enterprise evolved by our modern civilization, as\r\nhunters track tigers in India jungles, but never before in the history\r\nof the country had they seen it grasp with paws and jaws the government\r\nof the United States and bend it to its will and make it a mere travesty\r\nof its pristine grandeur.\r\n\r\nThe people had seen this money power enter the church, touch the robed\r\npriest at the altar, blotch his soul, freeze his heart and make him a\r\ntraitor to his consecrated vows and send him forth a Judas with a bag\r\ncontaining the price of his treason; or, if true to his conviction,\r\nideas and ideals, to suffer the penalty of ostracism, to be blacklisted\r\nand to seek in vain for a sanctuary in which to expound Christ’s\r\ndoctrine of the brotherhood of man.\r\n\r\nThe people had seen this money power enter a university and grasp a\r\nprofessor and hurl him headlong into the street because every faculty of\r\nmind, redeemed by education and consecrated to truth, pointed out and\r\nillumined new pathways to the goal of human happiness and national\r\nglory.\r\n\r\nThe people had seen this money power practicing every art of duplicity,\r\ngrowing more arrogant and despotic as it robbed one and crushed another,\r\nbuilding its fortifications of the bones of its victims, and its palaces\r\nout of the profits of its piracies, until purple and fine linen on the\r\none side and rags upon the other side, defined conditions as mountain\r\nranges and rivers define the boundaries of nations—palaces on the hills,\r\nwith music and dancing and the luxuries of all climes, earth, air and\r\nsea-huts in the valley, dark and dismal, where the music is the dolorous\r\n“song of the shirt” and the luxuries rags and crusts.\r\n\r\nThese things had been seen by the people, but it was reserved for them\r\nin the progress of the Pullman strike to see this money power, by the\r\nfiat of corporations, grasp one by one the departments of the government\r\nand compel them to do its bidding as in old plantation days the master\r\ncommanded the obedience of his chattel slaves.\r\n\r\nThe corporations first attacked the judicial department of the\r\ngovernment, a department which, according to Thomas Jefferson, has\r\nmenaced the integrity of the Republic from the beginning.\r\n\r\nThey did not attack the supreme bench. A chain is no stronger than its\r\nweakest link, and the corporations knew where that was and the amount of\r\nstrain it would bear. How did they attack this weakling in the judicial\r\nchain?\r\n\r\nI am aware that innuendoes, dark intimations of venality are not\r\nregarded as courageous forms of arraignment, and yet the judicial\r\ndespotism which marked every step of the proceedings by which my\r\nofficial associates and myself were doomed to imprisonment, was marked\r\nby infamies, supported by falsehoods and perjuries as destitute of truth\r\nas are the Arctic regions of orange blossoms.\r\n\r\nTwo men quarrelled because one had killed the other’s dog with an ax.\r\nThe owner of the dog inquired, “when my dog attacked you, why did you\r\nnot use some less deadly weapon?” The other replied, “why did not your\r\ndog come at me with the end that had no teeth in it?”\r\n\r\nThere is an adage which says, “fight the devil with fire.” In this\r\nconnection why may it not be intimated that a judge who pollutes his\r\nhigh office at the behest of the money power has the hinges of his knees\r\nlubricated with oil from the tank of the corporation that thrift may\r\nfollow humiliating obedience to its commands?\r\n\r\nIf not this, I challenge the world to assign a reason why a judge, under\r\nthe solemn obligation of an oath to obey the constitution, should in a\r\ntemple dedicated to justice, stab the Magna Charta of American liberty\r\nto death in the interest of corporations, that labor might be disrobed\r\nof its inalienable rights and those who advocated its claim to justice\r\nimprisoned as if they were felons?\r\n\r\nYou may subject such acts of despotism to the severest analysis, you may\r\nprobe for the motive, you may dissect the brain and lay bare the\r\nquivering heart, and, when you have completed the task, you will find a\r\ntongue in every gash of your dissecting knife uttering the one word\r\n“pelf.”\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time a corporation dog of good reputation was charged with\r\nkilling sheep, though he had never been caught in the act. The\r\ncorporation had always found him to be an obedient dog, willing to lick\r\nthe hand of his master, and declared that he was a peaceable and\r\nlaw-abiding dog; but one day upon investigation the dog was found to\r\nhave wool in his teeth and thenceforward, though the corporation stood\r\nmanfully by him, he was believed to be a sheep-killing dog. The world\r\nhas no means of knowing what methods corporations employ to obtain\r\ndespotic decrees in their interest, but it is generally believed that if\r\nan examination could be made, there would be found wool in the teeth of\r\nthe judge.\r\n\r\nI do not profess to be a student of heredity, and yet I am persuaded\r\nthat men inherit the peculiarities of the primal molecules from which\r\nthey have been evolved. If the modern man, in spite of our civilizing\r\ninfluences, books, stage and rostrum, has more devil than divinity in\r\nhis nature, where rests the blame?\r\n\r\nLeaving the interrogatory unanswered, as it has been in all the past, it\r\nis only required to say that men with the ballot make a fatal mistake\r\nwhen they select mental and moral deformities and clothe them with\r\ndespotic power. When such creatures are arrayed in the insignia of\r\nauthority, right, justice and liberty are forever in peril.\r\n\r\nWhat reasons exist today for rhetorical apostrophes to the constitution\r\nof the Republic? Those who are familiar by experience, or by reading,\r\nwith the pathways of the storms on the ocean will recall recollections\r\nof ships with their sails rent and torn by the fury of the winds,\r\nrolling upon the yeasty billows and flying signals of distress. Clouds\r\nhad for days obscured sun and stars and only the eye of omnipotence\r\ncould tell whither the hulk was drifting—and today the constitution of\r\nour ship of state, the chart by which she had been steered for a\r\ncentury, has encountered a judicial tornado and only the gods of our\r\nfathers can tell whither she is drifting. True, Longfellow, inspired by\r\nthe genius of hope, sang of the good old ship:\r\n\r\n                “We know what master laid thy keel,\r\n                What workmen wrought thy ribs of steel,\r\n                  Who made each mast and sail and rope,\r\n                What anvils rang, what hammers beat,\r\n                In what a forge and what a heat\r\n                  Were shaped the anchors of thy hope.”\r\n\r\nBut the poet wrote before the chart by which the good old ship sailed\r\nhad been mutilated and torn and flung aside as a thing of contempt;\r\nbefore Shiras “flopped” and before corporations knew the price of\r\njudges, legislators and public officials as certainly as Armour knows\r\nthe price of pork and mutton.\r\n\r\nLongfellow wrote before men with heads as small as chipmunks and pockets\r\nas big as balloons were elevated to public office, and before the\r\ncorporation ruled in courts and legislative halls as the fabled bull\r\nruled in a china shop.\r\n\r\nNo afflatus, however divine, no genius, though saturated with the\r\ninspiring waters of Hippocrene, could now write in a spirit of patriotic\r\nfire of the old constitution, nor ever again until the people by the all\r\npervading power of the ballot have repaired the old chart, closed the\r\nrents and obscured the judicial dagger holes made for the accommodation\r\nof millionaires and corporations, through which they drive their\r\nfour-in-hands as if they were Cumberland gaps.\r\n\r\nHere, this evening, I am inclined to indulge in eulogistic phrase of\r\nLiberty because once more I am permitted to mingle with my\r\nfellow-citizens outside of prison locks and bars.\r\n\r\nShakespeare said:\r\n\r\n                “Sweet are the uses of adversity,\r\n                Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,\r\n                Wears yet a precious jewel in his head.”\r\n\r\nI know something of adversity, and with such philosophy as I could\r\nsummon have extracted what little sweetness it contained. I know little\r\nof toads, except that of the genus judicial, and if they have a precious\r\njewel in their heads or hearts it has not fallen to my lot to find it,\r\nthough the corporations seem to have been more successful.\r\n\r\nThe immortal bard also wrote that\r\n\r\n            “This our life, exempt from public haunt,\r\n            Finds tongues in trees, books in running brooks,\r\n            Sermons in stones, and good in everything.”\r\n\r\nIf to be behind prison bars is to be “exempt from public haunt,” then\r\nfor the past six months I may claim such exemption, with all the rapture\r\nto be found in listening to the tongues of trees, to the charming\r\nlessons taught by the books of the running brooks and to the profound\r\nsermons of the stones. There is not a tree on the Woodstock prison\r\ncampus, or near by, to whose tongued melodies or maledictions I have not\r\nin fancy listened when liberty, despotism or justice was the theme.\r\n\r\nThe bard of Avon, the one Shakespeare of all the ages, was up to\r\nhigh-water mark of divine inspiration when he said there were those who\r\ncould find tongues in trees, and never since trees were planted in the\r\ngarden of Eden has the tongue of a tree voiced a sentiment hostile to\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nThus, when in prison and exempt from judicial persecution, the tongues\r\nof trees as well as the tongues of friends taught me that sweets could\r\nbe extracted from adversity.\r\n\r\nNor was I less fortunate when I permitted my fancy to see a book in a\r\nrunning brook as it laughed and sang and danced its way to the sea, and\r\nfind that on every page was written a diviner song to liberty and love\r\nand sympathy than was ever sung by human voice.\r\n\r\nAnd as for the stones in Woodstock prison, they were forever preaching\r\nsermons and their themes were all things good and evil among men.\r\n\r\nIn prison my life was a busy one, and the time for meditation and to\r\ngive the imagination free rein was when the daily task was over and\r\nnight’s sable curtains enveloped the world in darkness, relieved only by\r\nthe sentinel stars and the earth’s silver satellite “walking in lovely\r\nbeauty to her midnight throne.”\r\n\r\nIt was at such times that the “Reverend Stones” preached their sermons,\r\nsometimes rising in grandeur to the Sermon on the Mount.\r\n\r\nIt might be a question in the minds of some if this occasion warrants\r\nthe indulgence of the fancy. It will be remembered that Aesop taught the\r\nworld by fables and Christ by parables, but my recollection is that the\r\nold “stone preachers” were as epigrammatic as an unabridged dictionary.\r\n\r\nI remember one old divine who, one night, selected for his text George\r\nM. Pullman, and said: “George is a bad egg—handle him with care. Should\r\nyou crack his shell the odor would depopulate Chicago in an hour.” All\r\nsaid “Amen” and the services closed. Another old sermonizer who said he\r\nhad been preaching since man was a molecule, declared he had of late\r\nyears studied corporations, and that they were warts on the nose of our\r\nnational industries,—that they were vultures whose beaks and claws were\r\ntearing and mangling the vitals of labor and transforming workingmen’s\r\nhomes into caves. Another old stone said he knew more about strikes than\r\nCarroll D. Wright, and that he was present when the slaves built the\r\npyramids; that God Himself had taught His lightning, thunderbolts,\r\nwinds, waves and earthquakes to strike, and that strikes would proceed,\r\nwith bullets or ballots, until workingmen, no longer deceived and\r\ncajoled by their enemies, would unify, proclaim their sovereignty and\r\nwalk the earth free men.\r\n\r\nO, yes, Shakespeare was right when he said there were sermons in stones.\r\nI recall one rugged-visaged old stone preacher who claimed to have been\r\na pavement bowlder in a street of heaven before the gold standard was\r\nadopted, and who discussed courts. He said they had been antagonizing\r\nthe decrees of heaven since the day when Lucifer was cast into the\r\nbottomless pit. Referring to our Supreme Court he said it was a nest of\r\nrodents forever gnawing at the stately pillars supporting the temple of\r\nour liberties. I recall how his eyes, as he lifted their stony lids,\r\nflashed indignation like orbs of fire, and how his stony lips quivered\r\nas he uttered his maledictions of judicial treason to constitutional\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nBut occasionally some old bald-headed ashler, with a heart beating\r\nresponsive to every human joy or sorrow, would preach a sermon on love\r\nor sympathy or some other noble trait that in spite of heredity still\r\nlived even in the heart of stones. One old divine, having read some of\r\nthe plutocratic papers on the Pullman strike and their anathemas of\r\nsympathy, when one workingman’s heart, throbbing responsive to the\r\ndivine law of love, prompted him to aid his brother in distress,\r\ndiscussed sympathy. He said sympathy was one of the perennial flowers of\r\nthe Celestial City, and that angels had transplanted it in Eden for the\r\nhappiness of Adam and Eve, and that the winds had scattered the seed\r\nthroughout the earth. He said there was no humanity, no elevating,\r\nrefining, ennobling influences in operation where there was no sympathy.\r\nSympathy, he said, warmed in every ray of the sun, freshened in every\r\nbreeze that scattered over the earth the perfume of flowers and glowed\r\nwith the divine scintillation of the stars in all the expanse of the\r\nheavens.\r\n\r\nReferring to the men and women of other labor organizations who had\r\nsympathized with the American Railway Union in its efforts to rescue\r\nPullman’s slaves from death by starvation, the old preacher placed a\r\ncrown of jeweled eulogies upon their heads and said that in all the\r\nmutations of life, in adversity or prosperity, in the vigor of youth or\r\nthe infirmities of age, there would never come a time to them when like\r\nthe Peri grasping a penitent’s tear as a passport to heaven, they would\r\nnot cherish as a valued souvenir of all their weary years that one act\r\nof sympathy of the victims of the Pullman piracy, and that when\r\npresented at the pearly gate of paradise, it would swing wide open and\r\nlet them in amidst the joyous acclaims of angels.\r\n\r\nFrom such reflections I turn to the practical lessons taught by this\r\n“Liberation Day” demonstration. It means that American lovers of liberty\r\nare setting in operation forces to rescue their constitutional liberties\r\nfrom the grasp of monopoly and its mercenary hirelings. It means that\r\nthe people are aroused in view of impending perils and that agitation,\r\norganization, and unification are to be the future battle cries of men\r\nwho will not part with their birthrights and, like Patrick Henry, will\r\nhave the courage to exclaim: “Give me liberty or give me death!”\r\n\r\nI have borne with such composure as I could command the imprisonment\r\nwhich deprived me of my liberty. Were I a criminal; were I guilty of\r\ncrimes meriting a prison cell; had I ever lifted my hand against the\r\nlife or the liberty of my fellowmen; had I ever sought to filch their\r\ngood name, I would not be here. I would have fled from the haunts of\r\ncivilization and taken up my residence in some cave where the voice of\r\nmy kindred is never heard. But I am standing here without a\r\nself-accusation of crime or criminal intent festering in my conscience,\r\nin the sunlight once more, among my fellowmen, contributing as best I\r\ncan to make this “Liberation Day” from Woodstock prison a memorial day,\r\nrealizing that, as Lowell sang:\r\n\r\n   “He’s true to God who’s true to man; wherever wrong is done,\r\n   To the humblest and the weakest, ’neath the all-beholding sun.\r\n   That wrong is also done to us, and they are slaves most base,\r\n   Whose love of right is for themselves and not for all their race.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Prison Labor\r\n\r\n                   _Its Effect on Industry and Trade_\r\n\r\n _Address before Nineteenth Century Club at Delmonico’s, New York City,\r\n                           March 21st, 1899._\r\n\r\nIn my early years I stood before the open door of a blazing furnace and\r\npiled in the fuel to create steam to speed a locomotive along the iron\r\ntrack of progress and civilization. In the costume of the craft, through\r\nthe grime of mingled sweat and smoke and dust I was initiated into the\r\ngreat brotherhood of labor. The locomotive was my alma mater. I mastered\r\nthe curriculum and graduated with the degree of D. D., not, as the\r\nlexicons interpret the letters, “Doctor of Divinity,” but that better\r\nsignification, “Do and Dare”—a higher degree than Aristotle conferred in\r\nhis Lyceum or Plato thundered from his academy.\r\n\r\nI am not in the habit of telling how little I know about Latin to those\r\nwho have slaked their thirst for learning at the Pierian springs, but\r\nthere is a proverb that has come down to us from the dim past which\r\nreads “Omnia vincit labor” and which has been adopted as the shibboleth\r\nof the American labor movement because, when reduced to English, it\r\nreads “Labor overcomes all things.” In a certain sense this is true.\r\nLabor has built this great metropolis of the new world, built it as\r\ncoral insects build the foundations of islands—build and die; build from\r\nthe fathomless depth of the ocean until the mountain billows are dashed\r\ninto spray as they beat against the fortifications beneath which the\r\nbuilders are forever entombed and forgotten.\r\n\r\nHere in this proud city where wealth has built its monuments grander and\r\nmore imposing than any of the seven wonders of the world named in\r\nclassic lore, if you will excavate for facts you will find the remains,\r\nthe bones of the toilers, buried and imbedded in their foundations. They\r\nlived, they wrought, they died. In their time they may have laughed and\r\nsung and danced to the music of their clanking chains. They married,\r\npropagated their species, and perpetuated conditions which, growing\r\nsteadily worse, are today the foulest blots the imagination can conceive\r\nupon our much vaunted civilization.\r\n\r\nAnd from these conditions there flow a thousand streams of vice and\r\ncrime which have broadened and deepened until they constitute a\r\nperpetual menace to the peace and security of society. Jails,\r\nworkhouses, reformatories and penitentiaries have been crowded with\r\nvictims, and the question how to control these institutions and their\r\nunfortunate inmates is challenging the most serious thought of the most\r\nadvanced nations on the globe.\r\n\r\nThe particular phase of this grave and melancholy question which we are\r\nto consider this evening is embodied in the subject assigned the\r\nspeakers: “Prison Labor, Its Effects on Industry and Trade.”\r\n\r\nI must confess that it would have suited my purpose better had the\r\nsubject been transposed so as to read: “Industry and Trade, Their Effect\r\non Labor,” for, as a Socialist, I am convinced that the prison problem\r\nis rooted in the present system of industry and trade, carried forward,\r\nas it is, purely for private profit without the slightest regard to the\r\neffect upon those engaged in it, especially the men, women and children\r\nwho perform the useful, productive labor which has created all wealth\r\nand all civilization.\r\n\r\nSerious as is the problem presented in the subject of our discussion, it\r\nis yet insignificant when compared with the vastly greater question of\r\nthe effect of our social and economic system upon industry and trade.\r\n\r\nThe pernicious effect of prison contract labor upon “free labor,” so\r\ncalled, when brought into competition with it in the open market, is\r\nuniversally conceded, but it should not be overlooked that prison labor\r\nis itself an effect and not a cause, and that convict labor is recruited\r\nalmost wholly from the propertyless, wage-working class and that the\r\ninhuman system which has reduced a comparative few from enforced\r\nidleness to crime, has sunk the whole mass of labor to the dead level of\r\nindustrial servitude.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore with the economic system, which is responsible for, not\r\nonly prison labor, but for the gradual enslavement and degradation of\r\nall labor, that we must deal before there can be any solution of the\r\nprison labor problem or any permanent relief from its demoralizing\r\ninfluences.\r\n\r\nBut we will briefly consider the effect of prison labor upon industry\r\nand then pass to the larger question of the cause of prison labor and\r\nits appalling increase, to which the discussion logically leads.\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest ages there has been a prison problem. The ancients had\r\ntheir bastiles and their dungeons. Most of the pioneers of progress, the\r\nhaters of oppression, the lovers of liberty, whose names now glorify the\r\npantheon of the world, made such institutions a necessity in their day.\r\nBut civilization advances, however slowly, and there has been some\r\nprogress. It required five hundred years to travel from the inquisition\r\nto the injunction.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier days punishment was the sole purpose of imprisonment.\r\nOffenders against the ruling class must pay the penalty in prison cell,\r\nwhich, not infrequently, was equipped with instruments of torture. With\r\nthe civilizing process came the idea of the reformation of the culprit,\r\nand this idea prompts every investigation made of the latter-day\r\nproblem. The inmates must be set to work for their own good, no less\r\nthan for the good of the state.\r\n\r\nIt was at this point that the convict labor problem began and it has\r\nsteadily expanded from that time to this and while there have been some\r\ntemporary modifications of the evil, it is still an unmitigated curse\r\nfrom which there can be no escape while an economic system endures in\r\nwhich labor, that is to say the laborer, man, woman and child, is sold\r\nto the lowest bidder in the markets of the world.\r\n\r\nMore than thirty years ago Prof. E. C. Wines and Prof. Theodore W.\r\nDwight, then commissioners of the Prison Association of New York, made a\r\nreport to the legislature of the state on prison industry in which they\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n  “Upon the whole it is our settled conviction that the contract\r\n  system of convict labor, added to the system of political\r\n  appointments, which necessarily involves a low grade of official\r\n  qualification and constant changes in the prison staff, renders\r\n  nugatory, to a great extent, the whole theory of our penitentiary\r\n  system. Inspection may correct isolated abuses; philanthropy may\r\n  relieve isolated cases of distress; and religion may effect isolated\r\n  moral cures; but genuine, radical, comprehensive, systematic\r\n  improvement is impossible.”\r\n\r\nThe lapse of thirty years has not affected the wisdom or logic of the\r\nconclusion. It is as true now as it was then. Considered in his most\r\nfavorable light, the convict is a scourge to himself, a menace to\r\nsociety and a burden to industry, and whatever system of convict labor\r\nmay be tried, it will ultimately fail of its purpose at reformation of\r\nthe criminal or the relief of industry as long as thousands of “free\r\nlaborers,” who have committed no crime, are unable to get work and make\r\nan honest living. Not long ago I visited a penitentiary in which a\r\nconvict expressed regret that his sentence was soon to expire. Where was\r\nhe to go, and what was he to do? And how long before he would be\r\nsentenced to a longer term for a greater crime?\r\n\r\nThe commission which investigated the matter in Ohio in 1877 reported to\r\nthe legislature as follows:\r\n\r\n  “The contract system interferes in an undue manner with the honest\r\n  industry of the state. It has been the cause of crippling the\r\n  business of many of our manufacturers; it has been the cause of\r\n  driving many of them out of business; it has been the cause of a\r\n  large percentage of reductions which have taken place in the wages\r\n  of our mechanics; it has been the cause of pauperizing a large\r\n  portion of our laborers and increasing crime in a corresponding\r\n  degree; it has been no benefit to the state; as a reformatory\r\n  measure it has been a complete, total and miserable failure; it has\r\n  hardened more criminals than any other cause; it has made total\r\n  wrecks morally of thousands and thousands who would have been\r\n  reclaimed from the paths of vice and crime under a proper system of\r\n  prison management, but who have resigned their fate to a life of\r\n  hopeless degradation; it has not a single commendable feature. Its\r\n  tendency is pernicious in the extreme. In short, it is an\r\n  insurmountable barrier in the way of the reformation of the\r\n  unfortunates who are compelled to live and labor under its evil\r\n  influences; it enables a class of men to get rich out of the crimes\r\n  committed by others; it leaves upon the fair escutcheon of the state\r\n  a relic of the very worst form of human slavery; it is a bone of\r\n  ceaseless contention between the state and its mechanical and\r\n  industrial interests; it is abhorred by all and respected by none\r\n  except those, perhaps, who make profit and gain out of it. It should\r\n  be tolerated no longer but abolished at once.”\r\n\r\nAnd yet this same system is still in effect in many of the states of the\r\nUnion. The most revolting outrages have been perpetrated upon prison\r\nlaborers under this diabolical system. Read the official reports and\r\nstand aghast at the atrocities committed against these morally deformed\r\nand perverted human creatures, your brothers and my brothers, for the\r\nprivate profit of capitalistic exploiters and the advancement of\r\nChristian civilization.\r\n\r\nWhat a commentary on the capitalist competitive system! First, men are\r\nforced into idleness. Gradually they are driven to the extremity of\r\nbegging or stealing. Having still a spark of pride and self-respect they\r\nsteal and are sent to jail. The first sentence seals their doom. The\r\nbrand of Cain is upon them. They are identified with the criminal class.\r\nSociety, whose victims they are, has exiled them forever, and with this\r\ncurse ringing in their ears they proceed on their downward career,\r\nsounding every note in the scale of depravity until at last, having\r\ngraduated in crime all the way from petit larceny to homicide, their\r\nlast despairing sigh is wrung from them by the hangman’s halter. From\r\nfirst to last these unfortunates, the victims of social malformation,\r\nare made the subjects of speculation and traffic. The barbed iron of the\r\nprison contractor is plunged into their quivering hearts that their\r\ntorture may be coined into private profit for their exploiters.\r\n\r\nIn the investigation in South Carolina, where the convicts had been\r\nleased to railroad companies, the most shocking disclosures were made.\r\nOut of 285 prisoners employed by one company, 128, or more than 40 per\r\ncent, died as the result, largely, of brutal treatment.\r\n\r\nIt is popular to say that society must be protected against its\r\ncriminals. I prefer to believe that criminals should be protected\r\nagainst society, at least while we live under a system that makes the\r\ncommission of crime necessary to secure employment.\r\n\r\nThe Tennessee tragedy is still fresh in the public memory. Here, as\r\nelsewhere, the convicts, themselves brutally treated, were used as a\r\nmeans of dragging the whole mine-working class down to their\r\ncrime-cursed condition. The Tennessee Coal and Iron Company leased the\r\nconvicts for the express purpose of forcing the wages of miners down to\r\nthe point of subsistence. Says the official report: “The miners were\r\ncompelled to work in competition with low-priced convict labor, the\r\npresence of which was used by the company as a scourge to force free\r\nlaborers to its terms.” Then the miners, locked out, their families\r\nsuffering, driven to desperation, appealed to force and in a twinkling\r\nthe laws of the state were trampled down, the authorities overpowered\r\nand defied, and almost five hundred convicts set at liberty.\r\n\r\nFortunately the system of leasing and contracting prison labor for\r\nprivate exploitation is being exposed and its frightful iniquities laid\r\nbare. Thanks to organized labor and to the spirit of prison reform, this\r\nhorrifying phase of the evil is doomed to disappear before an\r\nenlightened public sentiment.\r\n\r\nThe public account system, though subject to serious criticism, is far\r\nless objectionable than either the lease, the contract or the\r\npiece-price system. At least the prisoner’s infirmities cease to be the\r\nprey of speculative greed and conscienceless rapacity.\r\n\r\nThe system of manufacturing for the use of state, county and municipal\r\ninstitutions, adopted by the state of New York, is an improvement upon\r\nthose hitherto in effect, but it is certain to develop serious\r\nobjections in course of time. With the use of modern machinery the\r\nlimited demand will soon be supplied and then what? It may be in order\r\nto suggest that the prisoners could be employed in making shoes and\r\nclothes for the destitute poor and school books for their children and\r\nmany other articles which the poor sorely need but are unable to buy.\r\n\r\nDeveloping along this line it would be only a question of time until the\r\nstate would be manufacturing all things for the use of the people, and\r\nthen perhaps the inquiry would be pertinent: If the state can give men\r\nsteady employment after they commit crime, and manufacturing can be\r\ncarried forward successfully by their labor, why can it not give them\r\nemployment before they are driven to that extremity, thereby preventing\r\nthem from becoming criminals?\r\n\r\nAll useful labor is honest labor, even if performed in a prison. Only\r\nthe labor of exploiters, such as speculators, stock gamblers,\r\nbeef-embalmers and their mercenary politicians, lawyers and other\r\nparasites—only such is dishonest labor. A thief making shoes in a\r\npenitentiary is engaged in more useful and therefore more honest labor\r\nthan a “free” stonemason at work on a palace whose foundations are laid\r\nin the skulls and bones, and cemented in the sweat and blood of ten\r\nthousand victims of capitalistic exploitation. In both cases the labor\r\nis compulsory. The stonemason would not work for the trust-magnate were\r\nhe not compelled to.\r\n\r\nIn ancient times only slaves labored. And as a matter of fact only\r\nslaves labor now. The millions are made by the magic of manipulation.\r\nThe coal miners of West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana and\r\nIllinois receive an average wage of less than seventy-five cents a day.\r\nThey perform the most useful and necessary labor, without which your\r\nhomes, if possible at all, would be cheerless as caves and the great\r\nheart of industry would cease to throb. Are they free men, or are they\r\nslaves? And what is the effect of _their_ labor on trade and industry\r\nand upon themselves and their families? Dante would search the realms of\r\ninferno in vain for such pictures of horror and despair as are to be\r\nfound in the mining regions of free America.\r\n\r\nTo the student of social science the haggard fact stands forth that\r\nunder the competitive system of production and distribution the prison\r\nproblem will never be solved—and its effect upon trade and industry will\r\nnever be greatly modified. The fact will remain that whatever labor is\r\nperformed by prison labor could and should be performed by free labor,\r\nand when in the march of economic progress the capitalist system of\r\nindustry for private profit succumbs to the socialist system of industry\r\nfor human happiness, when the factory, which is now a penitentiary\r\ncrowded with life convicts, among whom children often constitute the\r\nmajority—when this factory is transformed into a temple of science, and\r\nthe machine, myriad-armed and tireless, is the only slave, there will be\r\nno prison labor and the problem will cease to vex the world, and to this\r\nit is coming in obedience to the economic law, as unerring in its\r\noperation as the law of gravitation.\r\n\r\nThat prison labor is demoralizing in its effect on trade and industry\r\nwhenever and wherever brought into competition with it, especially under\r\nthe various forms of the contract system, is of course conceded, but\r\nthat it has been, or is at present, a great factor in such\r\ndemoralization is not admitted. There is a tendency to exaggerate the\r\nblighting effects of prison labor for the purpose of obscuring the one\r\novershadowing cause of demoralized trade and impoverished industry.\r\n\r\nPrison labor did not reduce the miner to a walking hunger-pang, his wife\r\nto a tear-stained rag, and his home to a lair. Prison labor is not\r\nresponsible for the squares of squalor and miles of misery in New York,\r\nChicago and all other centers of population. Prison labor is not\r\nchargeable with the sweating dens in which the victims of capitalistic\r\ncompetition crouch in dread and fear until death comes to their rescue.\r\nPrison labor had no hand in Cœur d’Alene, Tennessee, Homestead,\r\nHazleton, Virden, Pana, that suburb of hell called Pullman and other\r\nensanguined industrial battle fields where thousands of workingmen after\r\nbeing oppressed and robbed were imprisoned like felons, and shot down\r\nlike vagabond dogs; where venal judges issued infamous injunctions and\r\ndespotic orders at the behest of their masters, enforcing them with\r\ndeputy marshals armed with pistols and clubs and supported by troops\r\nwith gleaming bayonets and shotted guns to drain the veins of workingmen\r\nof blood, but for whose labor this continent would still be a\r\nwilderness. Only the tortures of hunger and nakedness provoked protest,\r\nand this was silenced by the bayonet and bullet; by the club and the\r\nblood that followed the blow.\r\n\r\nPrison labor is not accountable for the appalling increase in insanity,\r\nin suicide, in murder, in prostitution and a thousand other forms of\r\nvice and crime which pollute every fountain and contaminate every stream\r\ndesigned to bless the world.\r\n\r\nPrison labor did not create our army of unemployed, but has been\r\nrecruited from its ranks, and both owe their existence to the same\r\nsocial and economic system.\r\n\r\nNor are the evil effects confined exclusively to the poor working class.\r\nThere is an aspect of the case in which the rich are as unfortunate as\r\nthe poor. The destiny of the capitalist class is irrevocably linked with\r\nthe working class. Fichte, the great German philosopher said,\r\n“Wickedness increases in proportion to the elevation of rank.”\r\n\r\nPrison labor is but one of the manifestations of our economic\r\ndevelopment and indicates its trend. The same cause that demoralized\r\nindustry has crowded our prisons. Industry has not been impoverished by\r\nprison labor, but prison labor is the result of impoverished industry.\r\nThe limited time at my command will not permit an analysis of the\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nThe real question which confronts us is our industrial system and its\r\neffects upon labor. One of these effects is, as I have intimated, prison\r\nlabor. What is its cause? What makes it necessary? The answer is, the\r\ncompetitive system, which creates wage-slavery, throws thousands out of\r\nemployment and reduces the wages of thousands more to the point of bare\r\nsubsistence.\r\n\r\nWhy is prison labor preferred to “free labor?” Simply because it is\r\ncheaper; it yields more profit to the man who buys, exploits and sells\r\nit. But this has its limitations. Capitalist competition that throngs\r\nthe streets with idle workers, capitalist production that reduces human\r\nlabor to a commodity and ultimately to crime—this system produces\r\nanother kind of prison labor in the form of child labor which is being\r\nutilized more and more to complete the subjugation of the working class.\r\nThere is this difference: The prison laborers are clothed and housed and\r\nfed. The child laborers whose wage is a dollar a week, or even less,\r\nmust take care of themselves.\r\n\r\nPrison labor is preferred because it is cheap. So with child labor. It\r\nis not a question of prison labor, or of child labor, but of _cheap_\r\nlabor.\r\n\r\nTenement-house labor is another form of prison labor.\r\n\r\nThe effects of cheap labor on trade and industry must be the same,\r\nwhether such labor is done by prisoners, tenement house slaves, children\r\nor starving “hoboes.”\r\n\r\nThe prison laborer produces by machinery in abundance but does not\r\nconsume. The child likewise produces, but owing to its small wages, does\r\nnot consume. So with the vast army of workers whose wage grows smaller\r\nas the productive capacity of labor increases, and then society is\r\nafflicted with overproduction, the result of under-consumption. What\r\nfollows? The panic. Factories close down, wage-workers are idle and\r\nsuffer, middle-class business men are forced into bankruptcy, the army\r\nof tramps is increased, vice and crime are rampant and prisons and\r\nwork-houses are filled to overflowing as are sewers when the streets of\r\ncities are deluged with floods.\r\n\r\nPrison labor, like all cheap labor, is at first a source of profit to\r\nthe capitalist, but finally it turns into a two-edged sword that cuts\r\ninto and destroys the system that produced it.\r\n\r\nFirst, the capitalist pocket is filled by the employment of cheap\r\nlabor—and then the bottom drops out of it.\r\n\r\nIn the cheapening process, the pauperized mass have lost their consuming\r\npower.\r\n\r\nThe case may now be summed up as follows:\r\n\r\n_First._ Prison labor is bad; it has a demoralizing effect on capitalist\r\ntrade and industry.\r\n\r\n_Second._ Child labor, tenement house and every other form of cheap\r\nlabor is bad; it is destructive of trade and industry.\r\n\r\n_Third._ Capitalist competition is bad; it creates a demand for cheap\r\nlabor.\r\n\r\n_Fourth._ Capitalist production is bad; it creates millionaires and\r\nmendicants, economic masters and slaves, thus intensifying the class\r\nstruggle.\r\n\r\nThis indicates that the present capitalist system has outlived its\r\nusefulness, and that it is in the throes of dissolution. Capitalism is\r\nbut a link in the chain of social and economic development. Just as\r\nfeudalism developed capitalism and then disappeared, so capitalism is\r\nnow developing socialism, and when the new social system has been\r\ncompletely evolved the last vestige of capitalism will fade into\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nThe gigantic trust marks the change in production. It is no longer\r\ncompetitive but co-operative. The same mode of distribution, which must\r\ninevitably follow, will complete the process.\r\n\r\nCo-operative labor will be the basis of the new social system, and this\r\nwill be for use and not for profit. Labor will no longer be bought and\r\nsold. Industrial slavery will cease. For every man there will be the\r\nequal right to work with every other man and each will receive the fruit\r\nof his labor. Then we shall have economic equality. Involuntary idleness\r\nwill be a horror of the past. Poverty will relax its grasp. The army of\r\ntramps will be disbanded because the prolific womb which now warms these\r\nunfortunates into life will become barren. Prisons will be depopulated\r\nand the prison labor problem will be solved.\r\n\r\nEach labor-saving machine will lighten the burden and decrease the hours\r\nof toil. The soul will no longer be subordinated to the stomach. Man\r\nwill live a complete life, and the march will then begin to an ideal\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nThere is a proverb which the Latin race sent ringing down the centuries\r\nwhich reads, “Omnia vincit amor,” or “Love conquers all things.” Love\r\nand labor in alliance, working together, have transforming, redeeming\r\nand emancipating power. Under their benign sway the world can be made\r\nbetter and brighter.\r\n\r\nIsaiah saw in prophetic vision a time when nations should war no\r\nmore—when swords should be transformed into plowshares and spears into\r\npruning hooks. The fulfillment of the prophecy only awaits an era when\r\nLove and Labor, in holy alliance, shall solve the economic problem.\r\n\r\nHere, on this occasion, in this great metropolis with its thousand\r\nspires pointing heavenward, where opulence riots in luxury which\r\nchallenges hyperbole, and poverty rots in sweat shops which only a\r\nShakespeare or a Victor Hugo could describe, and the transfer to canvas\r\nwould palsy the hand of a Michael Angelo—here, where wealth and want and\r\nwoe bear irrefutable testimony of deplorable conditions, I stand as a\r\nsocialist, protesting against the wrongs perpetrated upon Les\r\nMiserables, and pleading as best I can for a higher civilization.\r\n\r\nThe army of begging Lazaruses, with the dogs licking their sores at the\r\ngates of palaces, where the rich are clothed in purple and fine linen\r\nwith their tables groaning beneath the luxuries of all climes, make the\r\npalaces on the highland where fashion holds sway and music lends its\r\ncharms, a picture in the landscape which, in illustrating disparity,\r\nbrings into bolder relief the hut and the hovel in the hollow where\r\nwant, gaunt and haggard, sits at the door and where light and plenty,\r\ncheerfulness and hope are forever exiled by the despotic decree of\r\nconditions as cruel as when the Czar of Russia orders to his penal mines\r\nin Siberia the hapless subjects who dare whisper the sacred word\r\nliberty—as cruel as when this boasted land of freedom commands that a\r\nfar-away, innocent people shall be shot down in jungle and lagoon, in\r\ntheir bamboo huts, because they dream of freedom and independence.\r\n\r\nThese conditions are as fruitful of danger to the opulent as they are of\r\ndegradation to the poor. It is neither folly nor fanaticism to assert\r\nthat the country cannot exist under such conditions. The higher law of\r\nrighteousness, of love and labor will prevail. It is a law which\r\ncommends itself to reasoning men, a primal law enacted long before\r\nJehovah wrote the decalogue amidst the thunders and lightnings of Sinai.\r\nIt is a law written upon the tablets of every man’s heart and\r\nconscience. It is a law infinitely above the creeds and dogmas and\r\ntangled disquisitions of the churches—the one law which in its\r\noperations will level humanity upward until men, redeemed from greed and\r\nevery debasing ambition, shall obey its mandates and glory in its\r\ntriumph.\r\n\r\nLove and labor will give us the Socialist Republic—the Industrial\r\nDemocracy—the equal rights of all men and women, and the emancipation of\r\nall from the vicious and debasing thraldoms of past centuries.\r\n\r\n\r\n               The Socialist Party and the Working Class\r\n\r\n   _Opening Speech Delivered as Candidate of the Socialist Party for\r\n          President, at Indianapolis, Ind., September 1, 1904_\r\n\r\n _Mr. Chairman, Citizens and Comrades:_\r\n\r\nThere has never been a free people, a civilized nation, a real republic\r\non this earth. Human society has always consisted of masters and slaves,\r\nand the slaves have always been and are today, the foundation stones of\r\nthe social fabric.\r\n\r\nWage-labor is but a name; wage-slavery is the fact.\r\n\r\nThe twenty-five millions of wage-workers in the United States are\r\ntwenty-five millions of twentieth century slaves.\r\n\r\nThis is the plain meaning of what is known as\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE LABOR MARKET.\r\n\r\nAnd the labor market follows the capitalist flag.\r\n\r\nThe most barbarous fact in all christendom is the labor market. The mere\r\nterm sufficiently expresses the animalism of commercial civilization.\r\n\r\nThey who buy and they who sell in the labor market are alike dehumanized\r\nby the inhuman traffic in the brains and blood and bones of human\r\nbeings.\r\n\r\nThe labor market is the foundation of so-called civilized society.\r\nWithout these shambles, without this commerce in human life, this\r\nsacrifice of manhood and womanhood, this barter of babes, this sales of\r\nsouls, the capitalist civilizations of all lands and all climes would\r\ncrumble to ruin and perish from the earth.\r\n\r\nTwenty-five millions of wage-slaves are bought and sold daily at\r\nprevailing prices in the American Labor Market.\r\n\r\nThis is the\r\n\r\n\r\n                            PARAMOUNT ISSUE\r\n\r\nin the present national campaign.\r\n\r\nLet me say at the very threshold of this discussion that the workers\r\nhave but the one issue in this campaign, the overthrow of the capitalist\r\nsystem and the emancipation of the working class from wage-slavery.\r\n\r\nThe capitalists may have the tariff, finance, imperialism and other\r\ndust-covered and moth-eaten issues entirely to themselves.\r\n\r\nThe rattle of these relics no longer deceives workingmen whose heads are\r\non their own shoulders.\r\n\r\nThey know by experience and observation that the gold standard, free\r\nsilver, fiat money, protective tariff, free trade, imperialism and\r\nanti-imperialism all mean capitalist rule and wage-slavery.\r\n\r\nTheir eyes are open and they can see; their brains are in operation and\r\nthey can think.\r\n\r\nThe very moment a workingman begins to do his own thinking he\r\nunderstands the paramount issue, parts company with the capitalist\r\npolitician and falls in line with his own class on the political\r\nbattlefield.\r\n\r\nThe political solidarity of the working class means the death of\r\ndespotism, the birth of freedom, the sunrise of civilization.\r\n\r\nHaving said this much by way of introduction I will now enter upon the\r\nactualities of my theme.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE CLASS STRUGGLE.\r\n\r\nWe are entering tonight upon a momentous campaign. The struggle for\r\npolitical supremacy is not between political parties merely, as appears\r\nupon the surface, but at bottom it is a life and death struggle between\r\ntwo hostile economic classes, the one the capitalist, and the other the\r\nworking class.\r\n\r\nThe capitalist class is represented by the Republican, Democratic,\r\nPopulist and Prohibition parties, all of which stand for private\r\nownership of the means of production, and the triumph of any one of\r\nwhich will mean continued wage-slavery to the working class.\r\n\r\nAs the Populist and Prohibition sections of the capitalist party\r\nrepresent minority elements which propose to reform the capitalist\r\nsystem without disturbing wage-slavery, a vain and impossible task, they\r\nwill be omitted from this discussion with all the credit due the rank\r\nand file for their good intentions.\r\n\r\nThe Republican and Democratic parties, or, to be more exact, the\r\nRepublican-Democratic party, represent the capitalist class in the class\r\nstruggle. They are the political wings of the capitalist system and such\r\ndifferences as arise between them relate to spoils and not to\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\nWith either of these parties in power one thing is always certain and\r\nthat is that the capitalist class is in the saddle and the working class\r\nunder the saddle.\r\n\r\nUnder the administration of both these parties the means of production\r\nare private property, production is carried forward for capitalist\r\nprofit purely, markets are glutted and industry paralyzed, workingmen\r\nbecome tramps and criminals while injunctions, soldiers and riot guns\r\nare brought into action to preserve “law and order” in the chaotic\r\ncarnival of capitalistic anarchy.\r\n\r\nDeny it as may the cunning capitalists who are clearsighted enough to\r\nperceive it, or ignore it as may the torpid workers who are too blind\r\nand unthinking to see it, the struggle in which we are engaged today is\r\na class struggle, and as the toiling millions come to see and understand\r\nit and rally to the political standard of their class, they will drive\r\nall capitalist parties of whatever name into the same party, and the\r\nclass struggle will then be so clearly revealed that the hosts of labor\r\nwill find their true place in the conflict and strike the united and\r\ndecisive blow that will destroy slavery and achieve their full and final\r\nemancipation.\r\n\r\nIn this struggle the workingmen and women and children are represented\r\nby the Socialist party and it is my privilege to address you in the name\r\nof that revolutionary and uncompromising party of the working class.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        ATTITUDE OF THE WORKERS.\r\n\r\nWhat shall be the attitude of the workers of the United States in the\r\npresent campaign? What part shall they take in it? What party and what\r\nprinciples shall they support by their ballots? And why?\r\n\r\nThese are questions the importance of which are not sufficiently\r\nrecognized by workingmen or they would not be the prey of parasites and\r\nthe service tools of scheming politicians who use them only at election\r\ntime to renew their masters’ lease of power and perpetuate their own\r\nignorance, poverty and shame.\r\n\r\nIn answering these questions I propose to be as frank and candid as\r\nplain-meaning words will allow, for I have but one object in this\r\ndiscussion and that object is not office, but the truth, and I shall\r\nstate it as I see it, if I have to stand alone.\r\n\r\nBut I shall not stand alone, for the party that has my allegiance and\r\nmay have my life, the Socialist party, the party of the working class,\r\nthe party of emancipation, is made up of men and women who know their\r\nrights and scorn to compromise with their oppressors; who want no votes\r\nthat can be bought and no support under any false pretense whatsoever.\r\n\r\nThe Socialist party stands squarely upon its proletarian principles and\r\nrelies wholly upon the forces of industrial progress and the education\r\nof the working class.\r\n\r\nThe Socialist party buys no votes and promises no offices. Not a\r\nfarthing is spent for whiskey or cigars. Every penny in the campaign\r\nfund is the voluntary offerings of workers and their sympathizers and\r\nevery penny is used for education.\r\n\r\nWhat other parties can say the same?\r\n\r\nIgnorance alone stand in the way of socialist success. The capitalist\r\nparties understand this and use their resources to prevent the workers\r\nfrom seeing the light.\r\n\r\nIntellectual darkness is essential to industrial slavery.\r\n\r\nCapitalist parties stand for Slavery and Night.\r\n\r\nThe Socialist party is the herald of Freedom and Light.\r\n\r\nCapitalist parties cunningly contrive to divide the workers upon dead\r\nissues.\r\n\r\nThe Socialist party is uniting them upon the living issue:\r\n\r\nDeath to Wage Slavery!\r\n\r\nWhen industrial slavery is as dead as the issues of the Siamese\r\ncapitalist parties the Socialist party will have fulfilled its mission\r\nand enriched history.\r\n\r\nAnd now to our questions:\r\n\r\nFirst, all workingmen and women owe it to themselves, their class and\r\ntheir country to take an active and intelligent interest in political\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE BALLOT.\r\n\r\nThe ballot of united labor expresses the people’s will and the people’s\r\nwill is the supreme law of a free nation.\r\n\r\nThe ballot means that labor is no longer dumb, that at last it has a\r\nvoice, that it may be heard and if united shall be heeded.\r\n\r\nCenturies of struggle and sacrifice were required to wrest this symbol\r\nof freedom from the mailed clutch of tyranny and place it in the hand of\r\nlabor as the shield and lance of attack and defense.\r\n\r\nThe abuse and not the use of it is responsible for its evils.\r\n\r\nThe divided vote of labor is the abuse of the ballot and the penalty is\r\nslavery and death.\r\n\r\nThe united vote of those who toil and have not will vanquish those who\r\nhave and toil not, and solve forever the problem of democracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   THE HISTORIC STRUGGLE OF CLASSES.\r\n\r\nSince the race was young there have been class struggles. In every state\r\nof society, ancient and modern, labor has been exploited, degraded and\r\nin subjection.\r\n\r\nCivilization has done little for labor except to modify the forms of its\r\nexploitation.\r\n\r\nLabor has always been the mudsill of the social fabric—is so now and\r\nwill be until the class struggle ends in class extinction and free\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nSociety has always been and is now built upon exploitation—the\r\nexploitation of a class—the working class, whether slaves, serfs or\r\nwage-laborers, and the exploited working class in subjection have always\r\nbeen, instinctively or consciously, in revolt against their oppressors.\r\n\r\nThrough all the centuries the enslaved toilers have moved slowly but\r\nsurely toward their final freedom.\r\n\r\nThe call of the Socialist party is to the exploited class, the workers\r\nin all useful trades and professions, all honest occupations, from the\r\nmost menial service to the highest skill, to rally beneath their own\r\nstandard and put an end to the last of the barbarous class struggles by\r\nconquering the capitalist government, taking possession of the means of\r\nproduction and making them the common property of all, abolishing\r\nwage-slavery and establishing the co-operative commonwealth.\r\n\r\nThe first step in this direction is to sever all relations with\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CAPITALIST PARTIES.\r\n\r\nThey are precisely alike and I challenge their most discriminating\r\npartisans to tell them apart in relation to labor.\r\n\r\nThe Republican and Democratic parties are alike capitalist\r\nparties—differing only in being committed to different sets of\r\ncapitalist interests—they have the same principles under varying colors,\r\nare equally corrupt and are one in their subservience to capital and\r\ntheir hostility to labor.\r\n\r\nThe ignorant workingman who supports either of these parties forges his\r\nown fetters and is the unconscious author of his own misery. He can and\r\nmust be made to see and think and act with his fellows in supporting the\r\nparty of his class and this work of education is the crowning virtue of\r\nthe socialist movement.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.\r\n\r\nLet us briefly consider the Republican party from the worker’s\r\nstandpoint. It is capitalist to the core. It has not and can not have\r\nthe slightest interest in labor except to exploit it.\r\n\r\nWhy should a workingman support the Republican party?\r\n\r\nWhy should a millionaire support the Socialist party?\r\n\r\nFor precisely the same reason that all the millionaires are opposed to\r\nthe Socialist party, all the workers should be opposed to the Republican\r\nparty. It is a capitalist party, is loyal to capitalist interests and\r\nentitled to the support of capitalist voters on election day.\r\n\r\nAll it has for workingmen is its “glorious past” and a “glad hand” when\r\nit wants their votes.\r\n\r\nThe Republican party is now and has been for several years, in complete\r\ncontrol of government.\r\n\r\nWhat has it done for labor? What has it not done for capital?\r\n\r\nNot one of the crying abuses of capital has been curbed under Republican\r\nrule.\r\n\r\nNot one of the petitions of labor has been granted.\r\n\r\nThe eight hour and anti-injunction bills, upon which organized labor is\r\na unit, were again ruthlessly slain by the last congress in obedience to\r\nthe capitalist masters.\r\n\r\nDavid M. Parry has greater influence at Washington than all the millions\r\nof organized workers.\r\n\r\nRead the national platform of the Republican party and see if there is\r\nin all its bombast a crumb of comfort for labor. The convention that\r\nadopted it was a capitalist convention and the only thought it had of\r\nlabor was how to abstract its vote without waking it up.\r\n\r\nIn the only reference it made to labor it had to speak easy so as to\r\navoid offense to the capitalists who own it and furnish the boodle to\r\nkeep it in power.\r\n\r\nThe labor platforms of the Republican and Democratic parties are\r\ninterchangeable and non-redeemable. They both favor “justice to capital\r\nand justice to labor.” This hoary old platitude is worse than\r\nmeaningless. It is false and misleading and so intended. Justice to\r\nlabor means that labor shall have what it produces. This leaves nothing\r\nfor capital.\r\n\r\nJustice to labor means the end of capital.\r\n\r\nThe old parties intend nothing of the kind. It is false pretense and\r\nfalse promise. It has served well in the past. Will it continue to catch\r\nthe votes of unthinking and deluded workers?\r\n\r\nWhat workingmen had part in the Republican national convention or were\r\nhonored by it?\r\n\r\nThe grand coliseum swarmed with trust magnates, corporation barons,\r\nmoney lords, stock gamblers, professional politicians, lawyers,\r\nlobbyists and other plutocratic tools and mercenaries, but there was no\r\nroom for the horny-handed and horny-headed sons of toil. They built it,\r\nbut were not in it.\r\n\r\nCompare that convention with the convention of the Socialist party,\r\ncomposed almost wholly of working men and women and controlled wholly in\r\nthe interest of their class.\r\n\r\nBut a party is still better known by its chosen representatives than by\r\nits platform declarations.\r\n\r\nWho are the nominees of the Republican party for the highest offices in\r\nthe gift of the nation and what is their relation to the working class?\r\n\r\nFirst of all, Theodore Roosevelt and Charles W. Fairbanks, candidates\r\nfor President and Vice-President, respectively, deny the class struggle\r\nand this almost infallibly fixes their status as friends of capital and\r\nenemies of labor. They insist that they can serve both; but the fact is\r\nobvious that only one can be served and that one at the expense of the\r\nother. Mr. Roosevelt’s whole political career proves it.\r\n\r\nThe capitalists made no mistake in nominating Mr. Roosevelt. They know\r\nhim well and he has served them well. They know that his instincts,\r\nassociations, tastes and desires are with them, that he is in fact one\r\nof them and that he has nothing in common with the working class.\r\n\r\nThe only evidence to the contrary is his membership in the Brotherhood\r\nof Locomotive Firemen which seems to have come to him co-incident with\r\nhis ambition to succeed himself in the presidential chair. He is a full\r\nfledged member of the union, has the grip, signs and passwords; but it\r\nis not reported that he is attending meetings, doing picket duty,\r\nsupporting strikes and boycotts and performing such other duties as his\r\nunion obligation imposes.\r\n\r\nWhen Ex-President Grover Cleveland violated the constitution and\r\noutraged justice by seizing the state of Illinois by the throat and\r\nhandcuffing her civil administration at the behest of the crime-stained\r\ntrusts and corporations, Theodore Roosevelt was among his most ardent\r\nadmirers and enthusiastic supporters. He wrote in hearty commendation of\r\nthe atrocious act, pronounced it most exalted patriotism and said he\r\nwould have done the same himself had he been president.\r\n\r\nAnd so he would and so he will!\r\n\r\nHow impressive to see the Rough Rider embrace the Smooth Statesman!\r\nOyster Bay and Buzzard’s Bay! “Two souls with but a single thought, two\r\nhearts that beat as one.”\r\n\r\nThere is also the highest authority for the statement charging Mr.\r\nRoosevelt with declaring about the same time he was lauding Cleveland\r\nthat if he was in command he would have such as Altgeld, Debs and other\r\ntraitors lined up against a dead wall and shot. The brutal remark was\r\nnot for publication but found its way into print and Mr. Roosevelt,\r\nafter he became a candidate, attempted to make denial, but the words\r\nthemselves sound like Roosevelt and bear the impress of his savage\r\nvisage.\r\n\r\nFollowing the Pullman strike in 1894 there was an indignant and emphatic\r\npopular protest against “government by injunction,” which has not yet by\r\nany means subsided.\r\n\r\nOrganized labor was, and is, a unit against this insidious form of\r\njudicial usurpation as a means of abrogating constitutional restraints\r\nof despotic power.\r\n\r\nMr. Roosevelt with his usual zeal to serve the ruling class and keep\r\ntheir slaves in subjection, vaulted into the arena and launched his\r\ntirade upon the “mob” that dared oppose the divine rule of a corporation\r\njudge.\r\n\r\n“Men who object to what they style ‘government by injunction,’” said he,\r\n“are, as regards the essential principles of government, in hearty\r\nsympathy with their remote skin-clad ancestors, who lived in caves,\r\nfought one another with stone-headed axes and ate the mammoth and woolly\r\nrhinoceros. They are dangerous whenever there is the least danger of\r\ntheir making the principles of this ages-buried past living factors in\r\nour present life. They are not in sympathy with men of good minds and\r\ngood civic morality.”\r\n\r\nIn direct terms and plain words Mr. Roosevelt denounces all those who\r\noppose “Government by Injunction” as cannibals, barbarians and\r\nanarchists, and this violent and sweeping stigma embraces the whole\r\norganized movement of labor, every man, woman and child that wears the\r\nbadge of union labor in the United States.\r\n\r\nIt is not strange in the light of these facts that the national\r\ncongress, under President Roosevelt’s administration, suppresses\r\nanti-injunction and eight-hour bills and all other measures favored by\r\nlabor and resisted by capital.\r\n\r\nNo stronger or more convincing proof is required of Mr. Roosevelt’s\r\nallegiance to capital and opposition to labor, nor of the class struggle\r\nand class rule which he so vehemently denies; and the workingman who in\r\nthe face of these words and acts, can still support Mr. Roosevelt, must\r\nfeel himself flattered in being publicly proclaimed a barbarian, and\r\nsheer gratitude, doubtless, impels him to crown his benefactor with the\r\nhighest honors.\r\n\r\nIf the working class are barbarians, according to Mr. Roosevelt, this\r\nmay account for his esteeming himself as having the very qualities\r\nnecessary to make himself Chief of the Tribe.\r\n\r\nBut it must be noted that Mr. Roosevelt denounced organized labor as\r\nsavages long before he was a candidate for president. After he became a\r\ncandidate he joined the tribe and is today, himself, according to his\r\nown dictum, a barbarian and the enemy of civic morality.\r\n\r\nThe labor union to which President Roosevelt belongs and which he is\r\nsolemnly obligated to support, is unanimously opposed to “Government by\r\nInjunction.” President Roosevelt knew it when he joined it and he also\r\nknew that those who oppose injunction rule have the instincts of\r\ncannibals and are a menace to morality, but his proud nature succumbed\r\nto political ambition, and his ethical ideas vanished as he struck the\r\ntrail that led to the tribe and, after a most dramatic scene and\r\nimpressive ceremony, was decorated with the honorary badge of\r\ninternational barbarism.\r\n\r\nHow Theodore Roosevelt, the trade-unionist, can support the presidential\r\ncandidate who denounced him as an immoral and dangerous barbarian, he\r\nmay decide at his leisure, and so may all other union men in the United\r\nStates who are branded with the same vulgar stigma, and their ballots\r\nwill determine if they have the manhood to resent insult and rebuke its\r\nauthor, or if they have been fitly characterized and deserve humiliation\r\nand contempt.\r\n\r\nThe appointment of Judge Taft to a cabinet position is corroborative\r\nevidence, if any be required, of President Roosevelt’s fervent faith in\r\nGovernment by Injunction. Judge Taft first came into national notoriety\r\nwhen, some years ago, sitting with Judge Ricks, who was later tried for\r\nmalfeasance, they issued the celebrated injunction during the Toledo,\r\nAnn Arbor & North Michigan railroad strike that paralyzed the\r\nBrotherhoods of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen and won for them the\r\ngratitude and esteem of every corporation in the land. They were hauled\r\nto Toledo, the headquarters of the railroad, in a special car, pulled by\r\na special engine, on special time, and after hastily consulting the\r\nrailroad magnates and receiving instructions, let go the judicial\r\nlightning that shivered the unions to splinters and ended the strike in\r\ntotal defeat. Judge Taft is a special favorite with the trust barons and\r\nhis elevation to the cabinet was ratified with joy at the court of St.\r\nPlutus.\r\n\r\nStill again did President Roosevelt drive home his arch-enmity to labor\r\nand his implacable hostility to the trade-union movement when he made\r\nPaul Morton, the notorious union hater and union wrecker, his secretary\r\nof the navy. That appointment was an open insult to every trade-unionist\r\nin the country and they who lack the self-respect to resent it at the\r\npolls may wear the badge, but they are lacking wholly in the spirit and\r\nprinciples of union labor.\r\n\r\nGo ask the brotherhood men who were driven from the C. B. & Q. and the\r\nstriking union machinists on the Santa Fe to give you the pedigree of\r\nMr. Morton and you will learn that his hate for union men is equalled\r\nonly by his love for the scabs who take their places.\r\n\r\nSuch a man and such another as Sherman Bell, the military ferret of the\r\nColorado mine owners, are the ideal patriots and personal chums of Mr.\r\nRoosevelt, and by honoring these he dishonors himself and should be\r\nrepudiated by the ballot of every working man in the nation.\r\n\r\nMr. Fairbanks, the Republican candidate for Vice-President, is a\r\ncorporation attorney of the first class and a plutocrat in good and\r\nregular standing. He is in every respect a fit and proper representative\r\nof his party and every millionaire in the land may safely support him.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.\r\n\r\nIn referring to the Democratic party in this discussion we may save time\r\nby simply saying that since it was born again at the St. Louis\r\nconvention it is near enough like its Republican ally to pass for a twin\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\nThe former party of the “common people” is no longer under the boycott\r\nof the plutocracy since it has adopted the Wall street label and\r\nrenounced its middle class heresies.\r\n\r\nThe radical and progressive element of the former Democracy have been\r\nevicted and must seek other quarters. They were an unmitigated nuisance\r\nin the conservative counsels of the old party. They were for the “common\r\npeople” and the trusts have no use for such a party.\r\n\r\nWhere but to the Socialist party can these progressive people turn? They\r\nare now without a party and the only genuine Democratic party in the\r\nfield is the Socialist party, and every true Democrat should thank Wall\r\nstreet for driving him out of a party that is democratic in name only\r\nand into one that is democratic in fact.\r\n\r\nThe St. Louis convention was a trust jubilee. The Wall street\r\nreorganizers made short work of the free silver element. From first to\r\nlast it was a capitalistic convocation. Labor was totally ignored. As an\r\nincident, two thousand choice chairs were reserved for the Business\r\nMen’s League of St. Louis, an organization hostile to organized labor,\r\nbut not a chair was tendered to those whose labor had built the\r\nconvention hall, had clothed, transported, fed and wined the delegates\r\nand whose votes are counted on as if they were so many dumb driven\r\ncattle, to pull the ticket through in November.\r\n\r\nAs another incident, when Lieutenant Richmond Hobson dramatically\r\ndeclared that President Cleveland had been the only president who had\r\never been patriotic enough to use the federal troops to crush union\r\nlabor, the trust agents, lobbyists, tools and clackers screamed with\r\ndelight and the convention shook with applause.\r\n\r\nThe platform is precisely the same as the Republican platform in\r\nrelation to labor. It says nothing and means the same. A plank was\r\nproposed condemning the outrages in Colorado under Republican\r\nadministration, but upon order from the Parryites it was promptly thrown\r\naside.\r\n\r\nThe editor of _American Industries_, organ of the Manufacturers’\r\nAssociation, commented at length in its issue of July 15 on the triumph\r\nof capital and the defeat of labor at both Republican and Democratic\r\nnational conventions. Among other things he said: “The two labor\r\nlobbies, partly similar in make-up, were, to put it bluntly, thrown out\r\nbodily in both places.” And that is the simple fact and is known of all\r\nmen who read the papers. The capitalist organs exult because labor, to\r\nuse their own brutal expression, was kicked bodily out of both the\r\nRepublican and Democratic national conventions.\r\n\r\nWhat more than this is needed to open the eyes of workingmen to the fact\r\nthat neither of these parties is their party and that they are as\r\nstrangely out of place in them as Rockefeller and Vanderbilt would be in\r\nthe Socialist party?\r\n\r\nAnd how many more times are they to be “kicked out bodily” before they\r\nstay out and join the party of their class in which labor is not only\r\nhonored but is supreme, a party that is clean, that has conscience and\r\nconvictions, a party that will one day sweep the old parties from the\r\nfield like chaff and issue the Proclamation of Labor’s Emancipation?\r\n\r\nJudge Alton B. Parker corresponds precisely to the Democratic platform.\r\nIt was made to order for him. His famous telegram in the expiring hour\r\nremoved the last wrinkle and left it a perfect fit.\r\n\r\nThomas W. Lawson, the Boston millionaire, charges that Senator Patrick\r\nMcCarren, who brought out Judge Parker for the nomination, is on the pay\r\nroll of the Standard Oil Company as political master mechanic at twenty\r\nthousand dollars a year, and that Parker is the chosen tool of Standard\r\nOil. Mr. Lawson offers Senator McCarren one hundred thousand dollars if\r\nhe will disprove the charge.\r\n\r\nWilliam Jennings Bryan denounced Judge Parker as a tool of Wall street\r\nbefore he was nominated and declared that no self-respecting Democrat\r\ncould vote for him, and after his nomination he charged that it had been\r\ndictated by the trusts and secured by “crooked and indefensible\r\nmethods.” Mr. Bryan also said that labor had been betrayed in the\r\nconvention and need look for nothing from the Democratic party. He made\r\nmany other damaging charges against his party and its candidates, but\r\nwhen the supreme test came he was not equal to it, and instead of\r\ndenouncing the betrayers of the “common people” and repudiating their\r\nmade-to-order Wall street program, he compromised with the pirates that\r\nscuttled his ship and promised with his lips the support his heart\r\nrefused and his conscience condemned.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic nominee for President was one of the Supreme Judges of\r\nthe State of New York who declared the eight-hour law unconstitutional\r\nand this is an index of his political character.\r\n\r\nIn his address accepting the nomination he makes but a single allusion\r\nto labor and in this he takes occasion to say that labor is charged with\r\nhaving recently used dynamite in destroying property and that the\r\nperpetrators should be subjected to “the most rigorous punishment known\r\nto the law.” This cruel intimation amounts to conviction in advance of\r\ntrial and indicates clearly the trend of his capitalistically trained\r\njudicial mind. He made no such reference to capital, nor to those\r\nermined rascals who use judicial dynamite in blowing up the constitution\r\nwhile labor is looted and starved by capitalistic freebooters who\r\ntrample all law in the mire and leer and mock at their despoiled and\r\nhelpless victims.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to make more than passing reference to Henry G.\r\nDavis, Democratic candidate for Vice-President. He is a coal baron,\r\nrailroad owner and, of course, an enemy to union labor. He has amassed a\r\ngreat fortune exploiting his wage-slaves and has always strenuously\r\nresisted every attempt to organize them for the betterment of their\r\ncondition. Mr. Davis is a staunch believer in the virtue of the\r\ninjunction as applied to union labor. As a young man he was in charge of\r\na slave plantation and his conviction is that wage-slaves should be kept\r\nfree from the contaminating influence of the labor agitator and render\r\ncheerful obedience to their master.\r\n\r\nMr. Davis is as well qualified to serve his party as is Senator\r\nFairbanks to serve the Republican party and wage-workers should have no\r\ntrouble in making their choice between this pernicious pair of\r\nplutocrats, and certainly no intelligent workingman will hesitate an\r\ninstant to discard them both and cast his vote for Ben Hanford, their\r\nworking class competitor, who is as loyally devoted to labor as\r\nFairbanks and Davis are to capital.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE SOCIALIST PARTY.\r\n\r\nIn what has been said of other parties I have tried to show why they\r\nshould not be supported by the common people, least of all by\r\nworkingmen, and I think I have shown clearly enough that such workers as\r\ndo support them are guilty, consciously or unconsciously, of treason to\r\ntheir class. They are voting into power the enemies of labor and are\r\nmorally responsible for the crimes thus perpetrated upon their\r\nfellow-workers and sooner or later they will have to suffer the\r\nconsequences of their miserable acts.\r\n\r\nThe Socialist party is not, and does not pretend to be, a capitalist\r\nparty. It does not ask, nor does it expect the votes of the capitalist\r\nclass. Such capitalists as do support it do so seeing the approaching\r\ndoom of the capitalist system and with a full understanding that the\r\nSocialist party is not a capitalist party, nor a middle class party, but\r\na revolutionary working class party, whose historic mission it is to\r\nconquer capitalism on the political battle-field, take control of\r\ngovernment and through the public powers take possession of the means of\r\nwealth production, abolish wage-slavery and emancipate all workers and\r\nall humanity.\r\n\r\nThe people are as capable of achieving their industrial freedom as they\r\nwere to secure their political liberty, and both are necessary to a free\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nThe capitalist system is no longer adapted to the needs of modern\r\nsociety. It is outgrown and fetters the forces of progress. Industrial\r\nand commercial competition are largely of the past. The handwriting\r\nblazes on the wall. Centralization and combination are the modern forces\r\nin industrial and commercial life. Competition is breaking down and\r\nco-operation is supplanting it.\r\n\r\nThe hand tools of early times are used no more. Mammoth machines have\r\ntaken their places. A few thousand capitalists own them and many\r\nmillions of workingmen use them.\r\n\r\nAll the wealth the vast army of labor produces above its subsistence is\r\ntaken by the machine owning capitalists, who also own the land and the\r\nmills, the factories, railroads and mines, the forests and fields and\r\nall other means of production and transportation.\r\n\r\nHence wealth and poverty, millionaires and beggars, castles and caves,\r\nluxury and squalor, painted parasites on the boulevard and painted\r\npoverty among the red lights.\r\n\r\nHence strikes, boycotts, riots, murder, suicide, insanity, prostitution\r\non a fearful and increasing scale.\r\n\r\nThe capitalist parties can do nothing. They are a part, an iniquitous\r\npart, of the foul and decaying system.\r\n\r\nThere is no remedy for the ravages of death.\r\n\r\nCapitalism is dying and its extremities are already decomposing. The\r\nblotches upon the surface show that the blood no longer circulates. The\r\ntime is near when the cadaver will have to be removed and the atmosphere\r\npurified.\r\n\r\nIn contrast with the Republican and Democratic conventions, where\r\npoliticians were the puppets of plutocrats, the convention of the\r\nSocialist party consisted of workingmen and women fresh from their\r\nlabors, strong, clean, wholesome, self-reliant, ready to do and dare for\r\nthe cause of labor, the cause of humanity.\r\n\r\nProud indeed am I to have, been chosen by such a body of men and women\r\nto bear aloft the proletarian standard in this campaign, and heartily do\r\nI endorse the clear and cogent platform of the party which appeals with\r\nincreasing force and eloquence to the whole working class of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nTo my associate upon the national ticket I give my hand with all my\r\nheart. Ben Hanford typifies the working class and fitly represents the\r\nhistoric mission and revolutionary character of the Socialist party.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CLOSING WORDS.\r\n\r\nThese are stirring days for living men. The day of crisis is drawing\r\nnear and Socialists are exerting all their power to prepare the people\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\nThe old order of society can survive but little longer. Socialism is\r\nnext in order. The swelling minority sounds warning of the impending\r\nchange. Soon that minority will be the majority and then will come the\r\nco-operative commonwealth.\r\n\r\nEvery workingman should rally to the standard of his class and hasten\r\nthe full-orbed day of freedom.\r\n\r\nEvery progressive Democrat must find his way in our direction and if he\r\nwill but free himself from prejudice and study the principles of\r\nSocialism he will soon be a sturdy supporter of our party.\r\n\r\nEvery sympathizer with labor, every friend of justice, every lover of\r\nhumanity should support the Socialist party as the only party that is\r\norganized to abolish industrial slavery, the prolific source of the\r\ngiant evils that afflict the people.\r\n\r\nWho with a heart in his breast can look upon Colorado without keenly\r\nfeeling the cruelties and crimes of capitalism! Repression will not help\r\nher. Brutality will only brutalize her. Private ownership and\r\nwage-slavery are the curse of Colorado. Only Socialism will save\r\nColorado and the nation.\r\n\r\nThe overthrow of capitalism is the object of the Socialist party. It\r\nwill not fuse with any other party and it would rather die than\r\ncompromise.\r\n\r\nThe Socialist party comprehends the magnitude of its task and has the\r\npatience of preliminary defeat and the faith of ultimate victory.\r\n\r\nThe working class must be emancipated by the working class.\r\n\r\nWoman must be given her true place in society by the working class.\r\n\r\nChild labor must be abolished by the working class.\r\n\r\nSociety must be reconstructed by the working class.\r\n\r\nThe working class must be employed by the working class.\r\n\r\nThe fruits of labor must be enjoyed by the working class.\r\n\r\nWar, bloody war, must be ended by the working class.\r\n\r\nThese are the principles and objects of the Socialist party and we\r\nfearlessly proclaim them to our fellowmen.\r\n\r\nWe know our cause is just and that it must prevail.\r\n\r\nWith faith and hope and courage we hold our heads erect and with\r\ndauntless spirit marshal the working class for the march from Capitalism\r\nto Socialism, from Slavery to Freedom, from Barbarism to Civilization.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Craft Unionism\r\n\r\n                 _Speech at Chicago, November 23, 1905_\r\n\r\nWe have met under the auspices and in the interests of the Industrial\r\nWorkers of the World. Organized here in Chicago, less than five months\r\nago, the Industrial Workers already number almost, if not quite, a\r\nhundred thousand workingmen and women, enrolled as dues-paying members,\r\nin a revolutionary, economic organization of the working class.\r\n\r\nWhy has this new organization been instituted? Why will not the old\r\ntrade unions that already occupy the field serve the purpose? Why a new\r\norganization? These are questions that are up for consideration; that\r\naddress themselves to all the workers of the country, whether they favor\r\nor oppose the new organization.\r\n\r\nFor many years I have been connected with one and another of the old\r\ntrade unions. Indeed, since February, 1875, when I first joined the\r\nBrotherhood of Locomotive Firemen, I have been an active member of a\r\ntrade union; and during that time I have had some experience by virtue\r\nof which I trust I have profited sufficiently to enable me to determine\r\nwhether a trade union is organized for the purpose of serving the\r\nworking class or not.\r\n\r\nAt the very threshold of this discussion I aver that the old form of\r\ntrade unionism no longer meets the demands of the working class. I aver\r\nthat the old trade union has not only fulfilled its mission and outlived\r\nits usefulness, but that it is now positively reactionary, and is\r\nmaintained, not in the interests of the workers who support it, but in\r\nthe interests of the capitalist class who exploit the workers who\r\nsupport it.\r\n\r\nLet me cite an instance or two for illustration. The Brotherhood of\r\nLocomotive Engineers has been organized about forty years. It professes\r\nto be a trade union, an organization of and for the working class. The\r\norganization has the favor and support of practically every railroad\r\ncorporation in the United States. The late P. M. Arthur was its grand\r\nchief for many years. In the beginning of his official career he was\r\ntrue to the working class. As the organization developed in numbers and\r\nin power, and became a menace to the corporations, they realized the\r\nnecessity of securing control of that organization. And how did they go\r\nabout it? By making certain concessions to that so-called brotherhood,\r\nby flattering its grand chief, by declaring that they had no objection\r\nto a labor organization such as this brotherhood, especially while under\r\nthe supervision of so conservative a leader as Mr. Arthur. Every time\r\nthe corporations made a concession to the engineers it was at the\r\nexpense of poorly paid employes in other departments who were\r\nunorganized; and when the men in these departments protested and finally\r\nwent out on strike, the engineers have invariably been used by the\r\ncorporation to defeat their fellow-workers, who were in revolt against\r\ndegrading economic conditions.\r\n\r\nMr. Arthur was, therefore, a prime favorite with the railroad\r\ncorporations. They granted him annual passes over their lines; and when\r\nthe Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers met in convention, their\r\ndelegates were provided with special trains to transport them to and\r\nfrom the convention, free of charge, as evidence that the corporation\r\nappreciated the value of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers.\r\n\r\nSince the engineers were organized, the firemen, conductors, brakemen,\r\nswitchmen, telegraphers and trackmen have also been organized, and\r\nseveral other departments have been partially organized, and they all\r\nhave practically the same form of organization. They are all\r\nconservative. They all operate within the bounds set and approved by the\r\nrailroad corporations. Are they, can they be true to the men who pay the\r\ndues, to the workingmen who support them? I answer that they cannot. Not\r\nonly are they not true to the wage-workers who support them, but they\r\nare pressed into service, politically and otherwise, when occasion\r\ndemands it, in the interest of these corporations, and to the detriment\r\nof their own.\r\n\r\nOnly the other day, since this much-discussed matter of rate legislation\r\nhas been pending, the grand chiefs of these various brotherhoods have\r\nbeen convened. By whom? By the railroad corporations. For what purpose?\r\nThis will appear as I proceed.\r\n\r\nJust after the grand chiefs of these labor unions met with the railroad\r\nofficials, another meeting took place. Of whom? Of the representatives\r\nof the principal of these several organizations, who, acting under the\r\nadvice of their grand officers, proceeded to the city of Washington,\r\nheld a conference with President Roosevelt, and protested that the labor\r\nunions they represented, consisting of the railway workers of the\r\ncountry, were opposed to any sort of legislation that would have a\r\ntendency to reduce railroad rates in the United States. The announcement\r\nalso went forth at the same time that these brotherhoods would make\r\ntheir political power felt in the interests of the railroad\r\ncorporations; that is to say, against the common people, the toiling\r\nmillions of the land.\r\n\r\nWhat a picture, indeed!\r\n\r\nOne glance proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that these unions are\r\nexceedingly useful to the corporations; and to the extent that they\r\nserve the economic and political purposes of the corporations, they are\r\nthe foes—and not the friends—of the working class.\r\n\r\nThe United Mine Workers, in point of numbers a powerful labor\r\norganization, embraces a large majority of the coal miners of the\r\ncountry. Is this organization of any real benefit to coal miners? What\r\nhas it actually done for them during the last few years? What have the\r\nminers, who have paid millions of dollars from their scant earnings in\r\nsupport of the organization, what have they to show in return?\r\n\r\nThese miners are well organized. They have the numbers. They ought to\r\nhave real economic power. But they lack it. And why? For the simple\r\nreason that they are not organized upon the basis of the class struggle.\r\nTheir union principles are not right; and it is for this reason that\r\ntheir organization has the hearty support of the coal operators of the\r\ncountry, who, by the way, are in session in Chicago at this very time,\r\nfor the purpose of uniting, for the purpose of dealing with the miners,\r\nnot through the rank and file of their union, but, as they themselves\r\ndeclare, _through their national board_.\r\n\r\nAnd this is a very important point for the union miners to take into\r\nconsideration. These operators, these exploiters, who are conscious of\r\ntheir class interests, propose to deal, not with the union at large, not\r\nwith the great body of the miners, not with the rank and file, not with\r\nthe common herd, not with the black beasts of burden, but with their\r\nNational Executive Board. They will fix things that are out of joint and\r\nsettle matters generally. They will arrive at mutually satisfactory\r\nconclusions. They will harmonize beautifully. And when they do\r\nharmonize, it will be in the interests, not of the miners who do the\r\nwork, who dig the coal, who produce the wealth, but in the interests of\r\nthe operators who own the mines and exploit the slaves of the pits.\r\n\r\nWhy, the most zealous supporter of the United Mine Workers is the coal\r\noperator himself. The simple fact that the coal operator collects the\r\nunion dues, and discharges the miner who refuses to pay his dues, is\r\nsufficient evidence of this fact.\r\n\r\nThe coal operator does not collect the dues from the man who happens to\r\nbelong to the Industrial Workers. He knows enough to know what is good\r\nfor him; and he knows that the miners, organized as they are at present,\r\ncan do him little harm, but can do him great good. And this is why he\r\nwants the miners organized in the pure and simple old-fashioned way. He\r\nknows that if they were totally unorganized they would spontaneously go\r\nout on strike. But they cannot strike as they are now organized without\r\nsecuring the sanction of their national, district and local officers;\r\nand so the operator keeps a friendly eye upon the union which fortifies\r\nand facilitates the exploitation of the coal diggers in his mines.\r\n\r\nAt stated periods the operators and representatives of the miners meet;\r\nand sometimes the sessions are very spirited, the miners insisting upon\r\nan increase, and the operators upon a decrease of wages, as was the case\r\nat the last interstate conference, when the union officials declared\r\nthat under no circumstances would they accept a reduction, and the\r\ndelegates voted by practically a unanimous vote not to accept any\r\nreduction, and for a while, there was every indication of a strike. But\r\nthe national officers met with the operators, and a reduction of wages\r\nwas agreed to, and then the union officers went out among the rank and\r\nfile and told them that if they were foolish enough to go out on strike\r\nthey would certainly be defeated, and that the best thing they could do\r\nwas to accept the reduction. So these union officials, backed by the\r\noperators, virtually forced the reduction upon the miners.\r\n\r\nThe operator can well afford to support that kind of a labor union.\r\n\r\nThe United Mine Workers, under its present policy, denies and seeks to\r\nobscure the class struggle. President Mitchell used to be quoted as\r\nsaying that the interests of the miners and the operators were\r\nidentical. He made an address the other day in which he claimed that he\r\nhad been misquoted; he had not said that their interests were identical,\r\nbut that they were reciprocal. I would like to have Mr. Mitchell show in\r\nwhat way the operator who fleeces the miner reciprocates to that miner.\r\nThe simple fact is that the operator—and I don’t know why he is called\r\nthat, he doesn’t operate anything—the operator takes from the miner what\r\nthe miner produces. He serves him in that capacity, and no other.\r\n\r\nThe miners’ union denies, in effect, the class struggle, and vainly\r\nseeks to harmonize the economic interests of these two antagonistic\r\nclasses—the exploiting masters and the exploited wage-slaves; the\r\nrobbers and the robbed. It cannot be done; not permanently at least; and\r\nif it be done even temporarily, it is always at the expense of the\r\nwage-slaves. Such an organization as that cannot truly serve the best\r\ninterests of the working class. It is impossible.\r\n\r\nThere are many who concur in these views, yet insist that the\r\norganization must be changed from the inside; that it can only be\r\nbrought to its proper position by “boring from within.” I deny it. It is\r\nhistorically impossible. This organization has practically run its\r\ncourse. It has fulfilled its mission as a labor union, whatever that has\r\nbeen. It is now practically in charge of the mine owners; and the only\r\nway the miners can get away from that situation is to sever their\r\nrelations with that capitalist-controlled union and join and build up\r\none of their own upon the basis of the class struggle; and then they\r\nwill be in position to fight the capitalist class with some chance of\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nThe most important fact in all the world for workingmen to take\r\ncognizance of is the class struggle. The Industrial Workers express\r\neconomically the interests of the working class in that struggle. The\r\nIndustrial Workers declare that there can be nothing in common between\r\nthe exploiting capitalist and the exploited wage-worker; that there is\r\ninevitably a struggle between them, and that this struggle cannot end\r\nuntil the capitalist class is overthrown, and the wage-system wiped out.\r\nThen and then only can there be an end to class rule.\r\n\r\nNow, if you are a workingman and if you believe that you have an\r\neconomic interest in common with that of the capitalist who employs you,\r\nremain in the old trade union. That is where you belong. If that is your\r\nconviction we do not want you to join the Industrial Workers. You do not\r\nproperly belong to us. You do belong to the American Federation of Labor\r\nand its affiliated organizations. But, if you believe, as I believe,\r\nthat the working class have economic interests of their own, separate\r\nand apart from and in conflict with the economic interests of the\r\ncapitalist class, then you should, and sooner or later will have to,\r\nsever your relation with the old trade union and join the Industrial\r\nWorkers, the only union organized upon the basis of class struggle.\r\n\r\nAnd now, let me ask, have we a class struggle? The answer comes of\r\nitself. This struggle finds expression daily, hourly, in strikes, in\r\nboycotts, in lockouts, injunctions, riots, assaults and bloodshed. It is\r\nnot an unmixed evil, however, for in this great world-wide class\r\nstruggle, that is shaking the foundations of civilized society\r\neverywhere, there are being wrought out the most important problems of\r\nour modern civilization.\r\n\r\nThe working class are in an overwhelming majority. They have the\r\nnumbers. They ought to have the power. And they would have the power if\r\nonly they were conscious of their interests _as a class_.\r\n\r\nEvery effort is put forth by the exploiting capitalist to prevent\r\nworkingmen from seeing the class struggle. The capitalist insists that\r\nthere is no such struggle. The editor in the employ of the capitalist\r\nechoes “no class struggle.” The teacher, professor and the minister, all\r\nof them dependent upon the capitalist for the chance to make a living,\r\nagree that there are no classes and no class struggle. In unison they\r\ndeclaim against class agitation and seek to obscure class rule that it\r\nmay be perpetuated indefinitely.\r\n\r\n_We_ insist that there _is_ a class struggle; that the working class\r\nmust recognize it; that they must organize economically and politically\r\nupon the basis of that struggle; and that when they do so organize they\r\nwill then have the power to free themselves and put an end to that\r\nstruggle forever.\r\n\r\nNow, have not the workers, especially here in Chicago, had sufficient\r\nexperience during the last few years? Have they not been defeated often\r\nenough to demonstrate the inherent weakness of the old trades union\r\nmovement? Haven’t they been enjoined by the Courts often enough? Clubbed\r\nby the police and flung into jail often enough? Haven’t they had\r\nexperience of this kind enough to open their eyes to the fact that there\r\nis a mighty class struggle in progress, and that there will never be any\r\nmaterial change in their condition until they unite their class in every\r\ndepartment of industrial activity?\r\n\r\nSpeaking for myself, I was made to realize long ago that the old trade\r\nunion was utterly incompetent to deal successfully with the exploiting\r\ncorporations in this struggle. I was made to see that in craft unionism\r\nthe capitalist class have it in their power to keep the workers divided,\r\nto use one part of them with which to conquer and crush another part of\r\nthem. Indeed, I was made to see that the old form of unionism separates\r\nthe workers and keeps them helpless at the mercy of their masters.\r\n\r\nObject lessons are presented to you every day in the week. You have\r\nhundreds of thousands of workers organized in Chicago, in every\r\nconceivable kind of a union, and under the direction of an infinite\r\nvariety of leaders. I will not say that these leaders are all\r\nincompetent or corrupt. That would not be true. But many of them are\r\ncorrupt, and in that capacity have it in their power to betray and sell\r\nout the workers who trust them. In this position the workers will\r\nremain—where there is no hope for them—so long as they cling to the\r\noutgrown old trade union and its inefficient methods. We have had the\r\nproof of this over and over again. Take all the great strikes that have\r\noccurred in Chicago during the last few years. Have any of them been\r\nsuccessful? Have they not uniformly failed?\r\n\r\nThe capitalists have not entirely stamped out the defeated unions, that\r\nis true. They have had the power to do this in the hour of the workers’\r\ndefeat, but they have refrained from doing it, because they are shrewd\r\nenough to know that if they destroyed those unions, another and better\r\none would take their places. Is it not a fact that they had the butcher\r\nworkmen absolutely at their mercy, and could have compelled the members\r\nto entirely withdraw from the unions before giving them employment? They\r\ndid not crush the unions out. When they had conquered they were\r\nsatisfied. They had driven the unionists back to their reservations and\r\nthey were perfectly satisfied that they should build up again along the\r\nsame old lines.\r\n\r\nThe Employers’ Association had the striking teamsters completely at\r\ntheir mercy, and could, had they seen fit, have utterly crushed out\r\ntheir union. They did not do it. In the closing part of the negotiations\r\nthe settlement hinged upon the alleged privilege of the teamsters\r\nwearing their union badges, and this the Employers’ Association finally\r\nconceded; and then the claim was put forth that the striking teamsters\r\nhad come out victorious. The truth is that they lost everything; but the\r\nemployer was not anxious to destroy their organization. He knew very\r\nwell that if he did a stronger one would spring from the ruins; that a\r\ncrushed union at least teaches workingmen to see its inherent defects.\r\n\r\nThe employer is shrewd enough to know that when you totally wipe out\r\norganizations you drive the workers into solidarity.\r\n\r\nThe teamsters were entirely defeated, nothing left; and yet their\r\nleaders boasted that they had served their organization. It reminded me\r\nof the dispatch once sent from a field of battle by a general who had\r\nbeen completely routed: “There is nothing left but honor, and d—n little\r\nof that!”\r\n\r\nIt is true that there are some employers who are supposed to be entirely\r\nopposed to unionism, even the old form of trade unionism. But the great\r\nmajority of capitalists, especially the shrewder, far-seeing ones,\r\nunqualifiedly approve the pure and simple labor union. And now let me\r\nshow that between these two sections of the capitalist class there is,\r\nafter all, no vital difference with regard to the trade union movement.\r\n\r\nC. W. Post, president of the Citizens’ Industrial Association, and David\r\nM. Parry, president of the Manufacturers’ Association, who are opposing\r\nthe American Federation of Labor, have repeatedly said that they are not\r\nopposed to trade unionism if it will confine itself to its “legitimate”\r\nfunctions. In other words, they are not opposed to trade unionism if it\r\ndoes not antagonize the capitalist class. That is their position. Now,\r\nwhat is the position of the great body of capitalists who avow their\r\nfriendship for the trade union movement? Precisely the same. They are in\r\nfavor of the trade union as long as it does not menace or attack the\r\ncapitalist class; that is, as long as it doesn’t do anything. And in its\r\npresent shape it is not doing anything; and that is why the capitalists\r\nare not opposed to it. Let these trade unions unite tomorrow; let them\r\ndeclare in favor of waging this fight along the lines of the class\r\nstruggle, and they will soon find out whether these capitalists are in\r\nfavor of trade unionism or not.\r\n\r\nThe very fact that the great majority of capitalists favor trade\r\nunionism proves that it is doing little or nothing for its members. Were\r\nit really doing something for them it would be antagonizing the\r\ncapitalist class, and that class would fight it. But the capitalists are\r\nnot fighting the old brand of unionism; they have, in fact, formed an\r\nalliance with it and the union is the silent partner in the firm.\r\n\r\nYou have all doubtless heard of the Civic Federation. This federation is\r\nsupposed to be fair and impartial. It is organized for the one purpose\r\nof dove-tailing the interests of labor and capital, and every member of\r\nthis body insists that these interests can be harmonized; that there is\r\nno necessary conflict between them. That is what Mr. Gompers says; that\r\nis what Mr. Mitchell says; that is what Archbishop Ireland and Bishop\r\nPotter say, and that is what they all say—that there is no necessary\r\nconflict between capitalists and wage-workers. If there be no necessary\r\nconflict between them, it follows that all the fighting that is going on\r\nmust be unnecessary. I suppose then that ought to be very easily ended.\r\n\r\nA gentleman named August Belmont presides over this harmonizing body.\r\nNot long ago, in an address, he claimed that there was no better\r\ntrade-unionist in the country than he, and he proved it during the\r\nInterborough strike in the city of New York, when several thousand union\r\nemployes of that corporation, of which he is president, went out on\r\nstrike because they were driven to that extremity by his pernicious\r\npolicy. He proved that he was a loyal trade-unionist when he employed\r\nJames Farley, the notorious professional strike-breaker, and his army of\r\nHessians to take the places of his former employes. Just a little while\r\nafter Mr. Belmont had thus defeated his employes and disrupted their\r\nunions, he met at the hospitable banqueting board of the Civic\r\nFederation with the national officers of the American Federation of\r\nLabor and its allied unions, and there made good his claim that he was a\r\ntrue trades-unionist of the old school.\r\n\r\nDo you think that a labor leader who is absolutely true to the working\r\nclass could sit at such a banquet with such a capitalist as Belmont? Do\r\nyou think he would be the guest of such an organization as the Civic\r\nFederation, whose only purpose is by subtle schemes to, reduce the\r\ntrade-union movement to harmless impotency?\r\n\r\nIt is for this and this alone that the Civic Federation has been\r\norganized. This is its real mission. The American Federation of Labor\r\nhas fallen within the fatal influence of this emasculating alliance, and\r\nhas thus proven that it is not organized to advance the true interests\r\nof the working class.\r\n\r\nThe American Federation of Labor is now holding its annual convention in\r\nthe city of Pittsburg. What are its delegates doing there? Simply\r\npassing the same old resolutions. Once more they are going to petition\r\nCongress to enact an eight-hour law. They have done that over and over\r\nagain, and their petition has been as repeatedly pigeon-holed. They have\r\nalso resolved to petition Congress to restrict the powers of capitalist\r\ncourts in dealing with labor. They have done that time and again, and\r\nwhat have they gained by it? Absolutely nothing. No attention has been\r\npaid to these servile supplications. They have been disregarded, thrown\r\naside, treated with contempt; but the delegates solemnly meet in\r\nconvention once more to pass the same hoary resolutions, to introduce\r\nthe same stale petitions, with the same inevitable results. Now, is not\r\nthis a perfectly stupid procedure? Are these men incapable of profiting\r\nby experience? Do they not by this time understand the nature and\r\nessential functions of capitalist-class government?\r\n\r\nCan they not see that we have a capitalist-class Congress, and\r\ncapitalist-class legislatures, elected in every instance by an ignorant\r\nworking class, kept ignorant, designedly, in the name of unionism, and\r\nwith the aid of the labor lieutenants of the capitalist class? And that\r\nit is the very height of folly and depth of humiliation for a committee\r\nof the working class to beg the representatives of the capitalist class\r\nto legislate in the interests of the working class?\r\n\r\nThey were elected to serve the masters. And they are serving them. And\r\nwe have no right to find fault with them—at least those of us who are\r\nresponsible for their being where they are.\r\n\r\nNow, we who have organized the Industrial Workers have had enough of\r\nthis kind of experience. We have quit the old unions. We have organized\r\nthe Industrial Workers for the purpose of uniting the working class; the\r\nwhole working class. Not only the skilled workers, not only those who\r\nare favored, but the working class, skilled and unskilled, male and\r\nfemale, in every department of activity, are united upon the principle\r\nof Industrial Unionism.\r\n\r\nThe old unions were built up on tools that have been discarded and upon\r\ntrades that have ceased to exist.\r\n\r\nHalf a century ago the trade union was right; it was adapted to the then\r\nexisting industrial conditions. For illustration, a cooper shop was a\r\ncooper shop. It contained coopers and coopers only, and the Coopers’\r\nUnion was organized. That embraced the coopers who were employed at\r\ntheir trade in the shop. Since then there has been half a century of\r\nindustrial evolution. Compare the great cooperage establishment of today\r\nwith the cooper shop of fifty years ago, in which the old hand tools\r\nwere used, in which the apprentice learned his trade, and having\r\nmastered this, could seize the small tools with which work was done and\r\nvirtually employ himself. There has been a marvelous change since that\r\ntime. A modern cooperage establishment is the result of industrial\r\nevolution; and if you will visit one you will find that scores of\r\ndifferent kinds of labor are performed there. Indeed, you will find\r\nalmost any kind of worker there except a cooper!\r\n\r\nNow, we behold that the form of the union must correspond to the mode of\r\nindustry. In other words, the union, like the trade, is subject to the\r\ninexorable laws of evolution. We want a union today that expresses all\r\nthe various subdivisions of labor now engaged in a cooperage\r\nestablishment. Suppose there are 500 such employes in a plant. We\r\norganize them all, and they are assigned to their various departments;\r\nand if one of them has a grievance it becomes the concern of every\r\nworker in that establishment.\r\n\r\nHow is it now? Certain departments are organized in craft unions, meet\r\nwith the officials and make an agreement or contract. They do not care\r\nwhat becomes of the rest, if only they can get what they are after for\r\nthemselves. After they are thus tied up, the employes in some other\r\ndepartment present a grievance and are turned down and out. They go out\r\non strike. Those tied fast in an agreement say: “We would like to help\r\nyou, we are in sympathy with you, but you see we have an agreement, and\r\nthat agreement is sacred; it must be preserved inviolate; and while we\r\nare in sympathy with you and hate to see you defeated and lose your\r\njobs, we cannot go back on our agreement.” And in this way one union is\r\nused to crush another, labor is defeated and scabs are made by\r\nthousands.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact that nearly all scabs and strike-breakers are ex-unionists.\r\nGo among them and interrogate them and you will find that they will tell\r\nyou in almost every case that at heart they are in favor of union labor,\r\nbut that they were beaten by it and found this the only way of getting\r\neven. I know of hundreds of instances, of my own knowledge, of men who\r\nhave been made scabs in precisely that way. Now, the trade unions feel\r\nvery bitter toward scabs, and pursue them relentlessly until the\r\nunfortunates seek escape in suicide. And yet, while they so bitterly\r\npersecute the scab, they support the union that makes the scab.\r\n\r\nWhat we want today, above all things, is united economic and political\r\naction, and we can never have that while the working class are parceled\r\nout among hundreds, aye, thousands, of separate unions, that keep them\r\ndivided for reasons, many of which very readily suggest themselves.\r\n\r\nWho is it that is so violently opposed to the Industrial Workers? It is\r\nnot the rank and file of the trade unions. It is their officers. And why\r\nare they so fiercely opposed to the Industrial Workers? For the reason\r\nthat when the working class are really united a great many labor leaders\r\nwill be out of jobs.\r\n\r\nThere are at present thousands of unions. Some of them have a few\r\nmembers and others have a great many; and every time, in the evolution\r\nof industry, there is a new subdivision of labor, however minute, a new\r\nunion must be launched, clear down to the Grand International\r\nBrotherhood of Peanut Peelers, Polishers and Packers, or whatever it may\r\nbe. And they elect a staff of their own grand international officers,\r\nand their names are put upon the payroll; and let me say to you that\r\ntheir interests are primarily in keeping themselves there.\r\n\r\nWhy should the railroad employes be parceled out among a score of\r\ndifferent organizations? They are all employed in the same service.\r\nTheir interests are mutual. They ought to be able to act together as\r\none. But they divide according to craft and calling, and if you were to\r\npropose today to unite them that they might actually do something to\r\nadvance their collective and individual interests as workers, you would\r\nbe opposed by every grand officer of these organizations. The payroll\r\nand expense account of the officers of the railroad brotherhoods alone\r\namount to more than a quarter of a million dollars a year.\r\n\r\nThere is an army of men who serve as officers who are on the salary list\r\nwho get a good living keeping the working class divided. They start out\r\nwith good intentions as a rule. They really want to do something to\r\nserve their fellows. They leave the shops or the mines as common\r\nworkingmen. They are elected officers of a labor organization and they\r\nchange their clothes. They now wear a white shirt and a standing collar.\r\nThey change their habits and their methods. They have been used to cheap\r\nclothes, coarse fare and to associating with their fellow-workers. After\r\nthey have been elevated to official position, as if by magic they are\r\nrecognized by those who previously scorned them and held them in\r\ncontempt. They find that some of the doors that were previously barred\r\nagainst them now swing inward, and they can actually put their feet\r\nunder the mahogany of the capitalist.\r\n\r\nOur common workingman is now a labor leader. The great capitalist pats\r\nhim on the back and tells him that he knew long ago that he was a coming\r\nman, that it was a fortunate thing for the workers of the world that he\r\nhad been born, that in fact they had been long waiting for just such a\r\nwise and conservative leader. And this has a certain effect upon our\r\nnew-made leader, and unconsciously, perhaps, he begins to change—just as\r\nJohn Mitchell did when Mark Hanna patted him on the shoulder and said,\r\n“John, it is a good thing you are at the head of the miners. You are the\r\nvery man. You have the greatest opportunity a labor leader ever had on\r\nthis earth. You can immortalize yourself. Now is your time.” Then John\r\nMitchell admitted that this capitalist, who had been pictured to him as\r\na monster, was not half as bad as he had thought he was; that, in fact,\r\nhe was a genial and companionable gentleman. He repeats his visit the\r\nnext day, or the next week, and is introduced to some other\r\ndistinguished person he had read about, but never dreamed of meeting,\r\nand thus goes on the transformation. All his dislikes disappear and all\r\nfeeling of antagonism vanishes. He concludes that they are really most\r\nexcellent people and, now that he has seen and knows them, he agrees\r\nwith them that there is no necessary conflict between workers and\r\ncapitalists. And he proceeds to carry out this pet capitalist theory and\r\nhe can only do it by betraying the class that trusted him and lifted him\r\nas high above themselves as they could reach.\r\n\r\nIt is true that such a leader is in favor with the capitalists; that\r\ntheir newspapers write editorials about him and crown him a great and\r\nwise leader; and that ministers of the gospel make his name the text for\r\ntheir sermons, and emphasize the vital point that if all labor leaders\r\nwere such as he there would be no objection to labor organizations. And\r\nthe leader feels himself flattered. And when he is charged with having\r\ndeserted the class he was supposed to serve, he cries out that the\r\nindictment is brought by a discredited labor leader. And that is\r\nprobably true. The person who brings the charge is very likely\r\ndiscredited. By whom? By the capitalist class, of course; and its press\r\nand pulpit and “public” opinion. And in the present state of the working\r\nclass, when he is discredited by the capitalists, he is at once\r\nrepudiated by their wage-slaves.\r\n\r\nThe labor leader who is not discredited by the capitalist class is not\r\ntrue to the working class. If he be unswervingly loyal to the working\r\nclass he will not be on friendly terms with the capitalist class. He\r\ncannot serve both. When he really serves one he serves that one against\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nThe labor leader who is in high favor with the exploiters is pronounced\r\nsafe, conservative, wise and honest, and the workers are appealed to to\r\nlook to him for advice, for guidance and leadership. The unthinking\r\naccept the advice with enthusiasm. And so the labor leader who serves\r\nthe capitalist class instead of the working class is hailed deliverer\r\nand basks in the public favor.\r\n\r\nBut let me say to you that in spite of all this the honest and\r\ndiscredited leaders will be lovingly remembered long after the popular\r\nones of today are forgotten.\r\n\r\nNow, in these matters, I am not asking you to take my advice. I am not\r\nasking you to follow me. I simply want you to think over these things\r\nfor yourselves. The very first need is that you open your eyes and see\r\nfor yourselves. Take nothing for granted.\r\n\r\nSo many of you are satisfied to blindly follow where others lead; and so\r\nyou are deceived and betrayed; you have to pay all the penalties.\r\n\r\nIt is high time you were ceasing to depend upon someone to “lead” you;\r\nthat you were opening your eyes; that you were doing your own thinking.\r\nAnd that is all I am asking you to do.\r\n\r\nI have already told you that I have had some experience and that I hope\r\nI have in some measure profited by it. I have been involved in strikes\r\nenough to satisfy me. I have so often been saddened by the outcome of\r\nsuch strikes.\r\n\r\nI have seen men by scores and hundreds and thousands, after striking for\r\nweeks and months, lose their jobs. I have seen the poor wretches\r\nblacklisted and I have seen them persecuted until they were in rags, and\r\ntheir families were upon the streets, and I have said there must be\r\nanother and a better way. I have seen enough of this to satisfy me.\r\nThere is a better way. But you will never find it by pursuing the old\r\nlines. You have got to unite the whole working class, and this can be\r\ndone. It is not an impossible task. Every worker, however limited his\r\nmentality, ought to be able to see that there is little or nothing to be\r\naccomplished along the old lines; that, in fact, there is no hope; that\r\nyou are engaged in an unequal struggle, and that the ultimate outcome is\r\ncertain to be defeat, despair and death.\r\n\r\nThe capitalists have at present ten thousand advantages over us. They\r\nown and control all the sources and means of wealth production. They are\r\nthe masters of the tools; they act together. They control all the powers\r\nof government. They can at their own sweet will shut down their mills\r\nand factories and mines, and they can wait patiently weeks and months\r\nand even years, until the impoverished workers become hungry and are\r\nglad to be taken back at any terms. The capitalists have all these\r\nadvantages, and they never hesitate to do anything, everything, that may\r\nbe required to keep the working class in subjection. And they can and\r\nwill keep them there just as long as they are divided.\r\n\r\nThere is but one hope, and that is in the economic and political\r\nsolidarity of the working class; one revolutionary union, and one\r\nrevolutionary party. It is for this reason that the Industrial Workers,\r\nan economic organization, has been launched and now makes its appeal to\r\nyou as wage-slaves aspiring to be free. You cannot be satisfied to live\r\nand die as beasts of burden; to toil unceasingly to enrich masters who\r\nhold you in contempt; to be dependent upon these masters for your jobs\r\nand crawl like sycophants at their feet. You may not be satisfied, even\r\nthough you have sufficient food and clothing and shelter. You are a\r\nhuman, not a hog; a man, not a mere animal. You have a manhood to\r\nsustain; you have your freedom to achieve, and you have an intellect to\r\ndevelop; and these questions will appeal to you with ever-increasing\r\nforce and compel an accounting at last, if you have the pith and purpose\r\nof a typical, self-respecting workingman.\r\n\r\nIn the capitalist system you workers are simply merchandise; your master\r\ncan at his own will sentence you to idleness, your wife to want and your\r\nchild, perhaps, to a brothel. You cannot be satisfied with such a\r\nslavish lot and now is the time to make up your mind to change it. In\r\nyour heart you will feel the thrill of a new-born joy. You will join the\r\nIndustrial Workers, the one international labor union that proposes to\r\nunite all workers, that all of them may act together in harmonious\r\nco-operation for the good of all; a union that recognizes no\r\naristocracy, but the whole working class; that insists that each member\r\nshall have all the rights that are accorded every other; a union built\r\nupon the class struggle, appealing to all workers to get together on the\r\nright side of that struggle and achieve the emancipation of their class.\r\n\r\nIt is true that this is a stupendous task; that there are great opposing\r\nforces; that every falsehood that malignity can devise will be put in\r\ncirculation to defeat the object of this industrial organization, but\r\nnevertheless, those of us who have quitted the old unions and organized\r\nthe Industrial Workers have done so with the determination that no\r\nmatter what opposing forces may be set in operation, we will stand\r\ntogether side by side in the true spirit of class-conscious solidarity;\r\nwe will move forward, step by step, in one solid body; we will speak the\r\ntruth as we see the truth, and defy all the opposition that may be\r\nbrought to bear against the Industrial Workers by all the capitalist\r\nclass and all its vassals and emissaries.\r\n\r\nThis organization has a mission as high and as noble as ever prompted\r\nworkingmen, or any other men, to action in this world.\r\n\r\nThe primal need of the working class is education. By education I mean\r\nrevolutionary education; the kind that enables men to see that the\r\ntwenty odd millions of wage-workers in the United States are\r\nwage-slaves; that the economic interests of these many millions of human\r\nbeings who do all the useful work and produce all the wealth are\r\nabsolutely identical; that they must unite; that they must act together;\r\nthat they must assert their collective power. When they reach this point\r\nthey will cease to be slaves and become the masters of the situation;\r\nthey will wipe out the wage-system and walk the earth free men.\r\n\r\nThey can do this, and only _they can_ do it.\r\n\r\nI cannot do this for you, and I want to be frank enough to say that I\r\nwould not if I could. For if I could do it for you, somebody else could\r\nundo it for you. But when you do it for yourselves it will remain done\r\nforever. And until you do it you have got to pay the penalty of your\r\nignorance, indifference and neglect. You have got to pay it to the last\r\nfarthing. Nobody on earth or in heaven can relieve you of the\r\nconsequences of your inaction. As long as you workers remain divided and\r\nat cross purposes, instead of closing up the ranks and acting together,\r\nyou will have to pay the penalty of defeat and humiliation and slavery\r\nand all their attendant brood and festering evils.\r\n\r\nBut day by day you are increasing the sum of your revolutionary\r\nknowledge. You are becoming wiser by experience. The Industrial Workers\r\nwould not have been possible a few years ago. It is an outgrowth of the\r\nvery conditions I have described. It has become an imperative necessity.\r\nThe workers everywhere are beginning to recognize it, and that is why\r\nthey are flocking to its standard. That is why they are subscribing to\r\nits principles; why they are working for it day and night with a zeal\r\nthat has never been known in the history of the organized working-class\r\nmovement; and why it is rapidly spreading over the whole country, and\r\nincreasing grandly in numbers and in power. Let me say to you that no\r\nmatter what formidable or subtle opposition may be marshaled against it\r\nby the capitalist class the ultimate triumph of its principles is as\r\ncertain as that I stand in your presence.\r\n\r\nThere are a great many workers who insist that the old unions are good\r\nenough; and as long as they are of that opinion that is where they\r\nbelong. So far as I am concerned I gave the old unions a fair trial. I\r\nam sure I had no prejudice against them. I am equally sure I did all I\r\npossibly could to build them up. For fifteen years I traveled almost\r\ncontinuously over this country organizing railroad men, and all kinds of\r\nworkingmen, under the mistaken conviction that if we could only get them\r\ninto the several unions of their trades and occupations we could in some\r\nway lift them out of their slavery. My mind was disabused. We had the\r\nrailroad men, especially in this part of the country, pretty thoroughly\r\norganized. We had the numbers and to some extent the power, but we\r\ndidn’t know about the class struggle. We had that to learn. Then came\r\nthe great conflict with the combined railroad corporations. We defeated\r\nthem; and then we learned that the corporations control the powers of\r\ngovernment. We got our first vital lesson in the class struggle. All the\r\ncorporations had to do was to press the judicial button in their private\r\noffice and the judges acted promptly in obedience to the command of\r\ntheir capitalist masters; the police and militia and regular troops\r\nfollowed in regular order; the press and pulpit and deputy marshals did\r\nthe rest—and that was enough.\r\n\r\nI never knew exactly how it happened until I understood the meaning of\r\neconomic determinism and the class struggle, and then it was perfectly\r\nclear to me. And from that time I realized the imperative necessity for\r\na different kind of organization. I then said, we have got to organize,\r\nnot only the railroad employes, but the whole body of workers for\r\nconcerted economic and political action; organize them all, so that all\r\nof them shall act together and assert the full measure of their power in\r\nthe interests of all. As soon as a beginning was attempted the railroad\r\ncorporations said, “This vicious thing must be stamped out of\r\nexistence,” and so, for two years, I scarcely traveled a foot without\r\nbeing shadowed by detectives of the railroad corporations. No matter\r\nwhere I went, the detectives were there. When I would reach the end of a\r\ncertain line the detectives who had followed me would go back where they\r\ncame from and others would take their places.\r\n\r\nI remember when I got to Providence, Rhode Island, one night, I was\r\nconscious that detectives were watching me very closely. I learned that\r\nthe railroad officials in New England had announced that the American\r\nRailway Union should never get a foothold there. There were two or three\r\nloyal men there I knew and could trust; I sent them word not to come to\r\nthe hotel and not to hold a meeting, but to come to my room at midnight,\r\nand come one at a time. And they did come to my room one at a time and I\r\norganized them in my room at midnight. I left the city early next\r\nmorning, and when I got to the next point I received a telegram\r\nreporting that they were all discharged, every one of them.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding our secrecy the corporations knew who had entered my\r\nroom and for what purpose; and the men were summarily discharged. Why\r\nwas it that the railroad corporations would not allow the American\r\nRailway Union to organize? For the simple reason that the American\r\nRailway Union proposed to line up all the railroad employes as the\r\nbeginning of a thorough reorganization of the working class in general,\r\nand the railroads did not propose to tolerate that kind of an\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nThey were and are entirely satisfied with the old brotherhoods,\r\nsupplying their officers with annual passes and their delegates with\r\nspecial trains to take them to and from their conventions. To such an\r\nextent is this partiality carried on some railroads that if a member of\r\none of the brotherhoods refuses to pay his dues and is expelled by the\r\nbrotherhood, he is promptly discharged by the corporation. The\r\ncorporation favors the organizations that divide, but is implacably\r\nhostile to the one that unites the workers.\r\n\r\nFor the same reason the capitalist newspapers have so ferociously\r\ndenounced the Industrial Workers.\r\n\r\nThey have warned workingmen that the Industrial Workers consists of\r\nanarchists, socialists, revolutionists and chronic fault-finders and\r\npeace-disturbers, who have been kicked out of other reputable labor\r\norganizations; of discredited leaders who do not lead, in whom the\r\nworkers have no confidence and for whom they can have no respect.\r\n\r\nThe capitalist press is a unit in denouncing the Industrial Workers, and\r\npractically a unit in commending the American Federation of Labor.\r\n\r\nIf you workers think that the capitalist press is a safe guide in such a\r\nmatter, you properly belong with the American Federation of Labor. But\r\nif you believe, as I believe, and as every intelligent workingman must\r\nbelieve, that the kind of labor organization that the capitalists\r\nendorse is not the kind that is for your good—that the organization the\r\ncapitalist press condemns is the one that has working class virtue and\r\nefficiency—then you will do as we have done; you will join the\r\nIndustrial Workers of the World.\r\n\r\nThink it over for yourself!\r\n\r\nTake a backward look over the last three or four years; satisfy yourself\r\nby your own study and observation that there has been little but defeat\r\nfor the workers in the struggle during all that period; that they have\r\ngained substantially nothing; that they are divided and disrupted and\r\nnot organized in any true sense at all. The time has come for a real\r\neconomic organization of the workers, and that organization is now in\r\nthe field and makes its appeal to all workers, and its principles and\r\npurposes deserve the encouragement, the support and the loyalty of every\r\nworkingman who has intelligence enough to understand his best interests\r\nand manhood enough to assert and stand by them.\r\n\r\nI shall occupy your time no longer. I think that no great argument is\r\nrequired in support of our position. The preamble to the constitution\r\nstates clearly and in few words the object of the Industrial Workers.\r\nYou will find it written there that the workers and capitalists have\r\nnothing in common; that there are a few who have all the good things in\r\nlife, while millions writhe in poverty and cry out in despair; that\r\nthose who do nothing and produce nothing are rich, while those who do\r\neverything and produce everything are poor; that these two classes\r\nconsist of capitalists who own tools they do not use, and of workers who\r\nuse tools they do not own; that the capitalists who own the tools have\r\nit in their power to take and do take from the workers what they\r\nproduce, and that the workers must organize both their economic and\r\npolitical power to take and hold that which they produce by their labor.\r\n\r\nThis is brief and to the point, and every workingman is capable of\r\nunderstanding it.\r\n\r\nAs the chairman has stated, the Industrial Workers has no object in\r\nconcealing any part of its mission, and while it proposes to ameliorate\r\nthe condition of the workers in every way in its power as far as that is\r\npossible in capitalist society, its ultimate object is to entirely\r\nabolish the capitalist system, by making the workers themselves the\r\nmasters of their tools, that they may work freely, unrestrained and\r\nunexploited; that they may secure to themselves and enjoy all the fruit\r\nof their own labors.\r\n\r\nThis is the object of the Industrial Workers, and if it has your\r\napproval, join it and help it to fulfill its mission, and thus hasten\r\nthe emancipation of the working class, and the brighter, happier day for\r\nall humanity.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\nQ. In the Industrial Workers are you going to separate the different\r\ntrades, or has a man who joins the privilege of going where he chooses?\r\n\r\nMr. Debs: He joins the department that represents his particular trade\r\nor occupation. The Industrial Workers is organized in separate\r\ndepartments, so that the autonomy of the trade is preserved within the\r\norganization. Take the men of a certain trade; they belong to a certain\r\ndepartment of the organization; they have jurisdiction over their own\r\ntrade affairs. They are subject, however, to the supervision of the\r\ngeneral organization. Take the machinists, for instance; they have a\r\ngrievance; it will be adjusted, primarily, if possible, within their own\r\ndepartment. If that is not possible then it becomes the grievance of the\r\ngeneral organization—the concern of all. Instead of merely the\r\nmachinists going out on strike as now, all their fellow-workers lay down\r\ntheir tools and support them to a finish.\r\n\r\nQ. Is it true that the Industrial Workers was organized because the\r\nworkers cannot gain anything by political action?\r\n\r\nMr. Debs: No, that is not true. The workers have never yet tried to get\r\nanything by united political action. They will some time, I do not\r\ndoubt. The Industrial Workers was organized because under the old form\r\nof organization they could get little or nothing by economic action. If\r\nthey had secured satisfactory concessions under the old forms there\r\nwould be no Industrial Workers. It has been organized because of the\r\nfailure of the old unions on the economic field. Now, if it can be shown\r\nthat they have succeeded, or even measurably succeeded, then there is no\r\nnecessity for the Industrial Workers. But if, on the other hand, it can\r\nbe shown that they have repeatedly and wretchedly failed, then there is\r\nan unanswerable argument in favor of the Industrial Workers.\r\n\r\nQ. What is a tradesman or a skilled worker? Why should there be any\r\ndistinction between a tradesman and any other worker in a shop?\r\n\r\nMr. Debs: That is not a very easy question to answer. There used to be a\r\ngreat many skilled mechanics who are now common workers. In proportion\r\nas machinery is improved the skill of the trade is transferred from the\r\nworker to the machine; and the skilled labor of one day becomes the\r\ncommon labor of the next. The locomotive engineer has always regarded\r\nhimself as a skilled worker, and he has refused to affiliate with what\r\nis called the common laborer. Within the next few years the locomotive\r\nengineer will probably become a motorman and he will then come off the\r\nperch. The work will be so simple that almost any worker can perform it.\r\nI have already referred to the coopers. In the town where I live there\r\nused to be a number of cooper shops in which there were skilled men; and\r\nthey had a large and strong Coopers’ Union. All the coopers that worked\r\nthere belonged to it. And these coopers didn’t have anything to do with\r\ncommon labor. They flocked by themselves upon the theory that they were\r\nskilled men and could not afford to put their skill on the same level\r\nwith the common labor of unskilled workers. During the last few years\r\nthat trade has undergone a complete change. The skilled coopers have\r\npractically disappeared and but a shadow of the old union remains.\r\n\r\nNow, if you will ask that old cooper, who was a skilled man and belonged\r\nto a union that represented skilled labor a few years ago—if you will\r\nask him who the skilled man is, I think he can give you a satisfactory\r\nanswer to your question. The skill of the trade is being gradually\r\neliminated, and we are taking cognizance of that fact. We Industrial\r\nWorkers recognize no aristocracy of skill. If any partiality were to be\r\nshown, however, I would give the unskilled man the benefit of it,\r\nbecause he needs it most. But there is no such discrimination in the\r\nIndustrial Workers. The workingman, skilled or unskilled, is a worker; a\r\nman, and, whatever his occupation, has all of the wants and aspirations\r\nand is entitled to all the rights and opportunities of a human being for\r\nself-development. The machine is rapidly reducing workers to a common\r\nindustrial equality, making the unskilled man the productive equal of\r\nthe skilled man. The machine is the skilled man, and when he gets\r\nthrough, that question will have answered itself.\r\n\r\nQ. Does the Industrial Workers make any provision for a wage scale?\r\n\r\nMr. Debs: Yes; it is going to get all the wages for its members that it\r\npossibly can, while the wage-system lasts.\r\n\r\nQ. How are you going to prevent the leaders from being as bad as those\r\nof the trades unions are today?\r\n\r\nMr. Debs: In the first place, there will be but a single organization.\r\nThere will not be a hundred different and conflicting organizations and\r\nas many different sets of officers.\r\n\r\nQ. Then they will have only one to buy; it won’t cost so much.\r\n\r\nMr. Debs: All the chances will be reduced to the minimum. Take the\r\nrailroad brotherhoods, for instance. If every locomotive engineer\r\nrunning into Chicago voted tomorrow to go out on strike they could not\r\ngo out without the official sanction of the Grand Chief of the\r\nBrotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, and he alone could prevent the\r\nstrike. That is, they might vote unanimously to strike, but the power of\r\none single grand officer would outweigh that of the entire organization.\r\nWith us it is the rank and file that decides and is the supreme power.\r\nIt is not likely they will sell themselves out. Besides, the Industrial\r\nWorkers is made up of a body of class-conscious industrial\r\nrevolutionists, who will not be sold out. They are wide-awake workers\r\nwho think for themselves, and that is why they are in the Industrial\r\nWorkers. The old trade unions are mainly run by the officers. Didn’t you\r\nnotice in the papers this morning that the coal operators who were here\r\nin session declared that they proposed to deal, not with the rank and\r\nfile, the common herd, but with the national officers of the union? They\r\nwill settle things, and that is how they are generally settled in the\r\nold unions; but that is not the way they will be settled in the\r\nIndustrial Workers.\r\n\r\nThis is an important point. Take a plant such as a brewery, for\r\ninstance; a score of different kinds of labor represented by as many\r\ndifferent organizations, and as many different sets of officers. Here\r\nare temptation and opportunity multiplied by twenty. Here we have\r\nwide-open chances and incentive to bribery, corruption and treachery.\r\nSuppose now, that the same plant is organized in the Industrial Workers.\r\nInstead of being parceled out among twenty different unions they are all\r\nembraced in one. The men in one department have a grievance. That plant\r\nhas a general committee; and if the grievance fails of adjustment in the\r\ndepartment in which it arises, it is referred to the general committee\r\nthat has supervision of the plant, and if they fail to satisfactorily\r\nadjust it, the matter goes to all the employes, as Industrial Workers,\r\nfor action. They vote to go out on strike and that settles it. In the\r\nIndustrial Workers no national officer and no set of national officers\r\nhave power to override the action of the rank and file. And when they\r\nvote to go out, they go out and stay out, until they vote to go back.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Class Unionism\r\n\r\n              _Speech at South Chicago, November 24, 1905_\r\n\r\nThe year now drawing to a close will be memorable in the annals of labor\r\nbecause of the organization of the Industrial Workers of the World.\r\n\r\nFor thirty years I have been connected with the labor movement. All of\r\nthe years of my young manhood were devoted to the work of organizing my\r\nfellow-workingmen, that by the power of united effort they might do\r\nsomething to improve their condition as workers, promote their interests\r\nas citizens and advance their general welfare as men. There was a time\r\nwhen I believed that the trade union was in itself sufficient for this\r\nwork. I have been compelled to revise my opinion and to conclude that\r\nsomething larger, more thorough and comprehensive in the way of\r\norganization is required to meet the demands of modern times.\r\n\r\nThe trade union, itself the product of industrial evolution, is subject\r\nto the laws of change, and the union that may have served some purpose a\r\nquarter of a century ago is now as completely out of date as the tools\r\nof industry that were then in use.\r\n\r\nNow, I assume that most of you are more or less familiar with the\r\nhistory of the industrial development of the land; that you know in a\r\ngeneral way that in the beginning of industrial society in the United\r\nStates, when the tool with which work was done was a simple hand tool,\r\nmade and used by an individual, the average workingman could look\r\nforward to the time when he would be an employer instead of an employe;\r\nthat, having mastered his trade, he could grasp the few simple tools\r\nwith which his work was done, virtually employ himself, own what he\r\nproduced and enjoy the fruit of his labor.\r\n\r\nAt that time one man worked for another, not in the capacity of a wage\r\nworker as we understand that term today, but simply to learn his trade,\r\nand having become the master of this he was in a position to command\r\nmost, if not all, his labor produced. It was when the simple tool of the\r\nhand laborer was supplanted by the machine and the workingman lost\r\ncontrol of the tool with which he worked, that the modern industrial\r\nrevolution had its beginning. The small employer became the capitalist\r\nand the employe became the wage worker; and there began the division of\r\nsociety into two distinct economic classes, and we have these classes\r\nbefore us today, in capitalist society, fully developed.\r\n\r\nThese two classes, consisting of relatively few capitalists who own\r\ntools in the form of great machines that they did not make and that they\r\ncannot use, and of a vast army of wage workers who did make these\r\nmachines and who do use them, but who do not own them—these two classes,\r\ntool-owners and tool-users; that is to say, masters and slaves,\r\nexploiters and exploited; to put it into perfectly plain terms, robbers\r\nand robbed—these two economic forces whose interests ceaselessly clash,\r\nare pitted against each other in a mighty struggle for the mastery. It\r\nis because of this conflict of economic interests between these two\r\nclasses into which modern society has been divided in the evolution of\r\nthe capitalist system that we have the strike, the boycott, the lockout,\r\nthe scab, the strike-breaker and slugger, and countless other evils that\r\nneed not be enumerated here, all of which spring from the fundamental\r\ncontradiction that inheres in capitalist society; that is, the\r\nindividual ownership of the social tool of production and the individual\r\nappropriation of the social product of the working class.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, the capitalist who does no useful work has the economic\r\npower to take from a thousand or ten thousand workingmen all they\r\nproduce, over and above what is required to keep them in working and\r\nproducing order, and he becomes a millionaire, perhaps a\r\nmulti-millionaire. He lives in a palace in which there is music and\r\nsinging and dancing and the luxuries of all climes. He sails the high\r\nseas in his private yacht. He is the reputed “captain of industry” who\r\nprivately owns a social utility, has great economic power, and commands\r\nthe political power of the nation to protect his economic interests. He\r\nis the gentleman who furnishes the “political boss” and his swarm of\r\nmercenaries with the funds with which the politics of the nation are\r\ncorrupted and debauched. He is the economic master and the political\r\nruler; and you workingmen are almost as completely at his mercy as if\r\nyou were his property under the law. It is true that he has no title to\r\nyour bodies; but he is the master of your jobs; he controls the\r\nemployment upon which your lives depend; he has it in his power to\r\ndecide whether you shall work or not; that is to say, whether you shall\r\nlive or die. And the man who has the power of life and death over you,\r\nthough he may not wear a crown or be hailed a king, is as completely\r\nyour master and your ruler as if you were his chattels and subject to\r\nhis commands under the laws of the state.\r\n\r\nWhat is your status as a workingman today? You are not in the position\r\nof your grandfather, who could work with tools of his own, and who, when\r\nhe produced something, was the master of it. Work is no longer done with\r\nthat kind of tools. It is done with the most intricate and costly\r\nmachinery, such as you have in this great steel plant here in South\r\nChicago. That is the twentieth century tool of production. Work is now\r\ndone with that kind of gigantic social agencies, made by you workingmen\r\nand used by you workingmen. Nobody but workingmen can make them; nobody\r\nbut workingmen can use them.\r\n\r\nYou have made all these marvelous machines and now your employment, your\r\nvery lives, depend upon your having access to them. But these large\r\ngrown tools, made by labor and used by labor, are not owned by labor in\r\nthe capitalist system, but belong to a capitalist or group of\r\ncapitalists who live in New York or some other remote point; and when it\r\nsuits their pleasure they can order their tool houses locked up and you\r\nworkingmen locked out without consulting you and without a moment’s\r\nwarning. You have not a word to say. At such a time it is useless for\r\nyou to leave here and look for work elsewhere, for when this mill closes\r\ndown so do others. You are out of employment and you begin to suffer,\r\nand most of you don’t know what the trouble is. You only know that you\r\nare no longer wanted at the mill; that workers are a drug on the market.\r\nWith these wonderful tools with which you now work, every few years you\r\nhave produced so much that all of the markets at home and abroad are\r\nglutted, and the capitalists cannot sell what you have produced in such\r\nabundance, and so they stop their machinery, shut up their mills, lock\r\nout their “hands” and paralyze industry, and there you are, idle,\r\nhelpless, hungry, hopeless, desperate. And these conditions will come\r\nupon you and become worse, no matter how well you are organized in your\r\nseveral trade unions; and this will continue as long as you workingmen\r\nallow the idle capitalists to own and control the tools of industry.\r\n\r\nHas it ever occurred to you workingmen that if you could make these\r\ntools and use them you can also own them and produce wealth in plenty\r\nfor yourselves?\r\n\r\nThe old trade union is organized on the basis of the identity of\r\ninterests of capitalists and wage workers, and spends its time and\r\ndevotes its energies to harmonizing these two classes; and it is a vain\r\nand hopeless task. When these interests can be even temporarily\r\nharmonized it is always in the interest of the capitalist class, and at\r\nthe expense of the working class.\r\n\r\nMost capitalists heartily approve the old form of trade unionism and\r\nencourage and liberally support it, for the very reason that this\r\noutgrown unionism does not truly represent and cannot actually express\r\nthe economic interests of the working class.\r\n\r\nThe simple fact is that industrial conditions have undergone such a\r\ncomplete change that now the trade union, instead of uniting the\r\nworkers, divides them, incites craft jealousy, breeds dissension and\r\npromotes strife—the very things capitalists desire; for so long as the\r\nworking class is divided, the capitalists will be secure in their\r\ndominion of the earth and the seas, and the millions of toilers will\r\nremain in subjection.\r\n\r\nNow, let me see if I can make myself perfectly clear upon this important\r\npoint. In the railroad service there are various organizations of\r\nemployes. Some of the departments are pretty thoroughly organized. The\r\nengineers, the firemen, conductors, brakemen, switchmen, telegraphers\r\nand some others are organized in their several craft unions. They have\r\nrepeatedly tried to federate these organizations, so as to bring them\r\ninto harmonious alliance with each other, but every such attempt has\r\nfailed. The selfish spirit of craft autonomy, that is, the jealousy of\r\neach particular branch to organize itself, establish its own petty\r\nsupremacy and look out for itself, has made it impossible to federate\r\nthese organizations. The members of these brotherhoods have increasing\r\ngrievances and try to have them adjusted in the old way. The railroad\r\ncorporations are always shrewd enough to enter into contractual\r\nrelations with unions representing two or three or four departments, so\r\nthat in every emergency they can always control these departments, while\r\nrefusing increases, making reductions or discharging without cause\r\nemployes in other departments of the service.\r\n\r\nIt has not been long ago since the union operators on the Missouri,\r\nKansas & Texas directed their committee to call on the railroad\r\nofficials for a small wage concession that had been granted by other\r\nsystems. But the company, having contracts with its engineers and\r\nfiremen, conductors and brakemen, peremptorily refused the request of\r\nthe telegraphers, and about 1,300 of them went out on strike—quit the\r\nservice of the company, as a union, to enforce their demands. What was\r\nthe result? This large body of union workingmen who thus went out on\r\nstrike to enforce a righteous claim all lost their jobs, every one of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIt was only a short time after they struck that I happened to go over\r\nthe system. I met the strikers at various points and they told me the\r\nstory of their defeat by their own fellow employes who belong to other\r\nunions. I understood it all before they told me. When the operators went\r\nout all the others remained at their posts, doing their usual work, and\r\nhauling and delivering scabs, wherever they were needed, to fill the\r\nplaces vacated by their fellow workers and fellow craft unionists. Union\r\nengineers and conductors took their train orders from scab operators;\r\nall the union men stood loyally by the company in its attack on one of\r\ntheir number, and so the operators were routed and scattered to the four\r\nwinds and their union wiped from the system.\r\n\r\nHere we have a perfect illustration of craft unionism in action. Another\r\nexample is furnished by the Santa Fe system where but a few months ago\r\nthe union machinists went out from one end of the system to the other.\r\nThe engineers and firemen, conductors and brakemen, and all the rest of\r\nthem holding union cards, remained faithfully at work until a new set of\r\nmachinists was employed and broken in, and now everything is running as\r\nsmoothly as before.\r\n\r\nStill another case of recent date is that of the Great Northern and the\r\nNorthern Pacific systems, where the telegraph operators, after having\r\nfailed in securing an adjustment of their grievances, went out on strike\r\nin a body, under orders from their union. What happened there? Just what\r\nhad happened on the M., K. & T. The engineers, firemen, conductors and\r\nbrakemen continued at their posts and discharged their duties with\r\nfidelity while their brother unionists, the operators, were mowed down\r\nand their places filled with scabs.\r\n\r\nIt is this that is taking place before our eyes every day. Here in\r\nChicago you have witnessed the crushing defeat of one regiment after\r\nanother of the army of organized labor. Indeed, during the last two or\r\nthree years all the great strikes have failed. There has not been a\r\nsingle exception to relieve the rule, not one.\r\n\r\nNow, when you see such things as these; when you see workingmen in craft\r\nunions go out on strike again and again and meet with constant defeat,\r\ndoes it not occur to you that there is something wrong with that kind of\r\nunionism? That that kind of unionism can be improved upon? Doesn’t it\r\noccur to you that instead of fighting the capitalist enemy, who are\r\nalways united, who always act together—that instead of fighting them by\r\nsquads and companies, the thing for us to do is to fight them as they\r\nfight us, with a united and compact army?\r\n\r\nIn this respect, if no other, we may well profit by the example set by\r\nthe enemy. They unite, because they are conscious of their interests as\r\na class. When the teamsters struck in this city last summer, the bankers\r\nsubscribed $50,000 to defeat them. Now, the teamsters were not striking\r\nagainst the bankers; but the teamsters were striking against the\r\ncapitalist class; and the bankers sprang loyally to the support of their\r\nclass. And this brings an important fact to our attention, and that is\r\nthat the struggle in which we are engaged today is a class struggle, and\r\nlabor organization, to be of any value to the working class, must be\r\nformed, not along craft lines, but along class lines.\r\n\r\nThe Industrial Workers is a working class organization, so\r\nall-inclusive, so comprehensive, that it will embrace every man and\r\nwoman who works for a livelihood. Certain departments have been\r\nestablished and certain subdivisions have been made, so that the\r\nidentity of the trade, the autonomy of the craft may be preserved within\r\nthe organization. Joining the Industrial Workers you take your place in\r\nyour proper department. That department which represents your employment\r\nis organized, it has control of craft interests within its jurisdiction,\r\nso that, so far as craft autonomy is concerned, it adjusts itself within\r\nthe general organization.\r\n\r\nSuppose you join the Industrial Workers as a switchman. You belong to\r\nthe transportation department. You have a grievance, as a switchman, and\r\nthe switchmen have charge of that grievance. The switchmen, organized in\r\ntheir respective department, having supervision of their craft affairs,\r\nseek to adjust that grievance. If they fail, then, instead of having to\r\nrely upon the switchmen alone in the support of that grievance, as now\r\nhappens, they can call to their aid, not only all the switchmen, but the\r\nfiremen, the conductors, the brakemen and engineers. They can call to\r\ntheir aid the boilermakers, the machinists and the blacksmiths, the\r\nshopmen and yardmen and office men; and, if it becomes necessary, they\r\ncan command the combined support of all the organized workers of that\r\nentire system.\r\n\r\nThat is the kind of unionism required to deal effectively with the\r\nindustrial situation of today.\r\n\r\nNow, I am well aware that there is tremendous opposition to this\r\norganization. I know that upon every hand you hear it said that we\r\nalready have plenty of organizations in the field, and that if they are\r\nnot right we ought to set them right instead of starting a new one. This\r\nkind of reasoning may have some effect with the unthinking, but if you\r\nare a student of this great question you know that it is historically\r\nimpossible for an old and outgrown and out-of-date labor organization to\r\nadjust itself to a new economic mission.\r\n\r\nReform unions rarely, if ever, become revolutionary bodies. It is\r\nadmitted that there are thousands of unions in the field. These unions\r\nall have staffs of officers, whose name is legion and on the payroll.\r\nThey all draw salaries and expense money. They don’t want the working\r\nclass united—that would mean an army of jobless leaders. You would be\r\namazed if you knew how many of such union officials there are; and you\r\nwould be still more amazed if you knew the aggregate amount of salary\r\nand expenses, millions of dollars, they draw every year. Now, they, like\r\nyou, are looking out for their jobs. It is perhaps too much to expect\r\nthem to discharge themselves. It is to their personal interest to keep\r\nthe workers of the country divided into a thousand different\r\norganizations, so that a thousand different sets of officials will be\r\nrequired; so that a thousand sets of officials may draw salary from the\r\nscant wages of the working class. You may be told that the reason I am\r\nin favor of a new union is that I am a discredited labor leader and that\r\nI am trying to create a new job for myself. The truth is that if I had\r\nbeen inclined to serve the corporations instead of the workers I could\r\nhave been drawing a large salary and enjoying to the full the popularity\r\nof what is miscalled successful labor leadership.\r\n\r\nYou railroad men know that the late P. M. Arthur, grand chief of the\r\nBrotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, was called by the capitalist press\r\na very successful labor leader. He was successful only in the sense that\r\nhe served with far greater fidelity the corporations than he did the\r\nemployes who paid his salary. I can remember the time when most of the\r\npresent grand officers of the railroad brotherhoods denounced Mr. Arthur\r\nof the Engineers, because of his conservative and reactionary policy.\r\nAll of these grand officers occupy today precisely the same position\r\nthat he did, and which they condemned. They are now just as acceptable\r\nto the railroads as was Mr. Arthur. These corporations not only do not\r\nobject to, but actually favor the leaders of these brotherhoods. In fact\r\nthe corporation officials find these organizations very serviceable to\r\nthem, and they would far rather have them than not. They could wipe them\r\nout—and they would if they were a menace to them—but they will not do\r\nit.\r\n\r\nA little thing occurred the other day which will prove what I say. I do\r\nnot know whether you happen to be aware of it, but the Brotherhood of\r\nEngineers and the Brotherhood of Firemen on the Northern Pacific a few\r\nweeks ago, clashed in the matter of jurisdiction; and that matter is\r\nbecoming more and more a plague to crafts unionism. The grand officers\r\nof the two brotherhoods met at St. Paul, and they had quite a heated\r\ncontroversy, which had a most sensational climax, grand chief Warren\r\nStone, of the engineers, hotly declaring to Grand Master Hannahan, of\r\nthe firemen, that if it came to a “showdown” the engineers would remain\r\nat their posts and if the firemen went out on strike, the engineers\r\nwould stay with the corporation and defeat the firemen. Now, the general\r\nmanager of the Northern Pacific, had he been so inclined, could have\r\nencouraged these two craft unions to clash and wipe each other from the\r\nsystem. But the railway official was too wise to allow this to be done.\r\nHe kindly interceded and told them that they ought not to quarrel with\r\neach other, that they should in truth love each other; and so he\r\nsucceeded in saving the unions and restoring harmonious relations.\r\n\r\nThe general manager appreciated the value of craft organization and\r\nproposed to preserve it for future use. Note again: the railroads grant\r\nannual passes to all the grand officers of these several organizations.\r\nWhy? Because they love you railroad employes? Not at all; but because\r\nthey are wise enough to understand their interests as corporations, as\r\ncapitalists. So you find that the grand officers of craft unions ride\r\nfree over railroads; and when the several brotherhoods hold their\r\nconventions they are provided with trains and Pullman cars and\r\ntransported to the convention city and back again free of charge. This\r\nis one of the best investments the railroads could make.\r\n\r\nIt costs them very little to furnish the delegates with free\r\ntransportation; and every penny of it comes out of your earnings. They\r\nknow that as you are now organized you can do little for yourselves, but\r\nthat you can do much for them. That is why they are so partial to the\r\nold organizations.\r\n\r\nLet me point out one of the ways they use you when they need you.\r\nPresident Roosevelt is championing a measure that is to empower the\r\nInterstate Commerce Commission to fix the rates of railroads in certain\r\ncases. This measure is opposed by the railroad corporations. They do not\r\nwant the government to interfere with their right to fix rates to suit\r\nthemselves. What do they do? They send for the grand chiefs of the\r\nseveral brotherhoods and a conference is held. Then the press despatches\r\nannounce that the railroad and brotherhood officials are one in their\r\nopposition to the proposed rate-fixing legislation. A few days later a\r\njoint session is held of the standing committees of the several\r\nbrotherhoods and they decide to stand by the railroads; and so they call\r\nupon President Roosevelt and serve notice upon him that they and the\r\nunions they represent are opposed to rate legislation.\r\n\r\nIn this the unions appear for the railroads; the brotherhoods being the\r\npuppets of the corporations; and in the meantime the railroad magnates\r\nannounce through the press that the employes are up in arms and will\r\nassert the political power of their unions in opposition to the\r\nrate-fixing measure.\r\n\r\nNot that there is anything of interest in rate legislation so far as you\r\nare concerned, but there is a vital point involved. When the railroads\r\nfind it necessary to use the brotherhoods as breastworks, or as weapons\r\nwith which to fight their battles, they issue their orders and the grand\r\nofficers and unions fall in line to the tune “our interests are mutual\r\nand we must stand together.” The unions then are made the active allies\r\nof the corporations in robbing and defying the people.\r\n\r\nIt is just because the corporations find these organizations exceedingly\r\nuseful that they make petty concessions to them. I recognized this fact\r\na number of years ago, and concluded then that what was needed for the\r\nemployes was a real working class union embracing them all. The American\r\nRailway Union was organized. There are those present who were in the\r\ngreat strike of 1894, and you know how bitterly we were fought by the\r\nrailroad corporations. You remember that they were not satisfied with\r\nmerely defeating us—and they never would have beaten us had they not\r\nbeen in control of the government. But for this the victory would have\r\nbeen won for the working class. They were defeated, completely; and when\r\nthey realized this they had their 3,600 thugs and thieves and convicts\r\nsworn in as deputy United States marshals, and they incited the riots\r\nand led the mobs, and then the courts issued their injunctions, while\r\nthe capitalist press flashed the lurid reports over the wires that\r\nChicago was at the mercy of a mob. The rest followed as a matter of\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nBut they were not satisfied with mere defeat of the strike. They must\r\ncrush the life out of the union. For two years after I was released by\r\nthe courts—after being eighteen months in their custody—I was followed\r\nby their detectives, to prevent organization; and those who were\r\nreported as joining, or even as being friendly, were instantly\r\ndischarged.\r\n\r\nThey defeated us, but they didn’t destroy us. We are stronger today than\r\nwe ever were, and we are coming again. We are on the main track. We are\r\nnot after a few pennies more a day this time. We are after the whole\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nYes, for two years after I was finally released, they followed me from\r\none end of the country to the other. They kept their detectives at my\r\nheels. And the order preceded me everywhere that the employes who had\r\nanything to do with Debs would be discharged.\r\n\r\nI concluded to go into those sections where the American Railway Union\r\nhad not been organized, and where there had been no strike; and I\r\nstarted south. When I reached Louisville, the morning paper contained\r\npress despatches with startling headlines reporting a series of\r\nresolutions passed by the railroad employes of that section, saying:\r\n“Whereas, we are advised that E. V. Debs, the anarchist, of Chicago, is\r\non his way south to disrupt the pleasant and harmonious relations that\r\nexist between the railroad employes and the companies; therefore, be it\r\nresolved, that we hereby serve notice on said anarchist, Debs, that we\r\nrepudiate him and that we have nothing to do with him nor the anarchist\r\norganization he represents.”\r\n\r\nAfter these resolutions appeared I had a number of letters from the poor\r\nslaves who were employed upon these railroads, apologizing for the\r\nresolutions, and saying that the railroad officials had prepared and\r\nsubmitted them to the employes for their signatures, and then given them\r\nto the press.\r\n\r\nBut even this was not sufficient. They discharged those who attended our\r\nmeetings. They had their special men at the doors of meeting places to\r\ntake the names of those who attended. They were determined to annihilate\r\nthe union and stamp out the last spark of its life. And they did succeed\r\nin crushing the organization, but they could not kill the spirit of the\r\nAmerican Railway Union. That still lives.\r\n\r\nA far greater organization has come to take its place—as much greater as\r\nthe American Railway Union was greater than the old union—and that\r\norganization is the Industrial Workers of the World. This great union is\r\norganized on the basis of the class struggle. It makes its appeal to the\r\nintelligence of the working class. It commands you workingmen to open\r\nyour eyes and see for yourselves; to use your brains, and think for\r\nyourselves; to cultivate self-reliance and learn to depend upon\r\nyourselves. That is your only safety.\r\n\r\nYou have been taught in the old union school to look to some leader; to\r\ndepend upon some master. You have been trained to submit; to follow and\r\nobey orders. You have not developed your own capacity for thinking; you\r\nare lacking in the essentials of sturdy manhood. Many of you have become\r\nsatisfied to blindly follow where others lead; and so you are often\r\ndeceived, betrayed; and when the smoke of battle clears away you find\r\nyourselves defeated and out of jobs. You have often felt disheartened;\r\nyou have quit the union in despair and disgust, and some of you have\r\nturned into scabs.\r\n\r\nThousands who once belonged to unions have become, not only non-union\r\nmen, but scabs and strike-breakers, and in their desperation have turned\r\nupon the union and become its most bitter enemies. If you will call the\r\nroll of the strike-breakers who gather here in Chicago and elsewhere\r\nwhen union workers are out on strike, you will find that nearly all of\r\nthem are ex-union men; men who once wore the badge of union labor,\r\nbelieved in it and marched proudly beneath the union banner.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think of a unionism that creates an army for its own\r\noverthrow? There is something fundamentally wrong with that kind of\r\nunionism.\r\n\r\nLong since, and after years of study and experience, I became convinced\r\nthat the old unions are not fit to cope successfully with the enemy of\r\nthe working class, and that a new organization was an imperative\r\nnecessity.\r\n\r\nIn the Industrial Workers we have a union large enough to embrace us\r\nall; a union organized upon democratic principles recognizing the equal\r\nrights of all and extending its benefits equally to all.\r\n\r\nIndustrial unionism is the principle upon which the Industrial Workers\r\nis organized. This means actual unity of purpose and action. It means\r\nthe economic solidarity of our class. It means that the grievance of one\r\nis the concern of all; and that from this time forward craft division is\r\nto be eliminated; that we are to get together and fight and win together\r\nfor all. Industrial unionism means that such a plant as you have here in\r\nSouth Chicago, in which ten or twelve thousand men are employed, shall\r\nbe thoroughly and efficiently organized.\r\n\r\nWhat is the condition there today? You have innumerable unions\r\nrepresented there, but no unity. You have this great body of workers\r\nparceled out among scores of petty and purposeless unions, which are in\r\nceaseless conflict with each other, jealous to preserve their craft\r\nidentity. As long as this great army of workers is scattered among so\r\nmany craft unions, it will be impossible for them to unite and act in\r\nharmony together.\r\n\r\nCraft unionism is the negation of solidarity. The more unions you have,\r\nthe less unity; and here, in fact, you have no unity at all. In this\r\nstate you can do nothing to improve your working condition. You are\r\nsubstantially at the mercy of the corporation.\r\n\r\nWhat you need is industrial unionism and you will have it when you get\r\ntogether in the Industrial Workers.\r\n\r\nWhen workingmen join the one economic working class organization that\r\nunites them upon the basis of the class struggle they can do something\r\nto better their working condition; not only will they have the economic\r\npower to do this, but they will represent a new and a vital force to\r\nwhich they are now total strangers—the revolutionary force that\r\nindustrial unionism generates in the body.\r\n\r\nThere is something far different between a strike on the part of unions\r\nin which men are ignorant, blindly striking against something that they\r\nonly vaguely understand, with no comprehension of the class\r\nstruggle—there is something vastly different between that kind of a\r\nstrike and the strike of the body of class-conscious, revolutionary\r\nworkingmen, who, while they are striking for an immediate advantage, at\r\nthe same time have their eyes clearly fixed upon the goal. And what is\r\nthat goal? It is the overthrow of the capitalist system and the\r\nemancipation of the working class from wage-slavery.\r\n\r\nThe Industrial Workers is essentially an educational organization—and\r\none of the vitally important things it will teach the workers is the\r\ncomplete operation and control of the industry in which they are\r\nemployed. Have you ever thought about that? Has it ever been brought to\r\nyour attention in craft unions?\r\n\r\nI have already reminded you that you workingmen have made all the\r\nmachinery there is in operation everywhere; that only you can use it.\r\nNow, why should not you own it?\r\n\r\nWhy shouldn’t you be your own employers? Why shouldn’t you be the\r\nmasters of your own jobs? Why depend upon the capitalist for a chance to\r\nwork? Why clothe him with the power to discharge and starve you at his\r\nwill? Why engage him to take from you all you produce except enough to\r\nkeep you at work? That is all that remains for you.\r\n\r\nYou get a wage, and that wage suffices to keep you working for the\r\ncapitalist. The tool you work with has got to be oiled, and you have got\r\nto be fed. The wage is simply your lubricant. The wage oils you and\r\nkeeps you in working order.\r\n\r\nThe capitalist doesn’t intend that you shall ever be anything but his\r\nwage-slave. He would scout the suggestion that you are his equal. He\r\ndoesn’t associate with you. He belongs to another class; and the class\r\nto which he belongs is called the upper class. You, as a workingman,\r\nbelong to the lower class. The working class has always been the lower\r\nclass, and is today; and you will be the lower class as long as you are\r\ncontent to be that class. It is in your power to make yourselves the\r\nupper class, and in fact the only class. You are in an overwhelming\r\nmajority. There are only a few capitalists as compared to you. And yet,\r\nthey own practically everything and rule the land; and will keep on\r\nowning and ruling the land as long as you workingmen allow them to; and\r\nyou will allow them to as long as you persist in remaining divided in\r\ntrade unions and being used against each other, instead of uniting and\r\nacting solidly with and for each other and against the capitalists.\r\n\r\nThe Industrial Workers is organized—and we declare it boldly—to fight\r\nthe capitalist class. We want it distinctly understood that we claim\r\nnothing in common with that class. They have economic interests separate\r\nfrom and opposed to the economic interests of the working class. And we\r\npropose that the working class shall be organized economically and\r\npolitically to retire the capitalist class from business.\r\n\r\nOur business is to put the exploiters of labor out of business.\r\n\r\nYou, Mr. Workingman, don’t need a capitalist; and if you think you do,\r\nit is because you are ignorant. It is because you don’t understand your\r\nown interest. You don’t need him. You imagine that he gives you a job;\r\nbut he does nothing of the kind. You give him a job. You employ him to\r\ntake from you what you produce; and he faithfully sticks to his job.\r\nWhy, the capitalist could not exist a second without you. Can you\r\nimagine a capitalist without workingmen?\r\n\r\nCapitalism is based upon the exploitation of the working class; and when\r\nthe working class ceases to be exploited, there will no longer be any\r\ncapitalists.\r\n\r\nNow, while the capitalist could not exist without you, you would just\r\nbegin to live without him. He is on your back; he rides you, and he\r\nrides you even when he rides in the automobile that you make. You make\r\nit. You never knew of a capitalist that ever made an automobile. The\r\ncapitalist doesn’t make it but rides in it; the workingman does make it\r\nbut does not ride in it.\r\n\r\nIf it were not for you the capitalist would have to walk, and if it were\r\nnot for him you would ride.\r\n\r\nYou don’t need the capitalist; he is, in fact, a curse to you. What has\r\nthe capitalist owner of a modern plant to do with its operation?\r\nAbsolutely nothing. He might as well live in the moon, as far as you are\r\nconcerned. There may be a group of them, but they have nothing to do\r\nwith the mill. They simply get what is produced there, because you will\r\nhave it so. You are organized on that basis. In your moss-covered old\r\nunions you say, “Our interests are mutual.” Certainly, if you can stand\r\nthis arrangement the capitalist can. He has no grievance.\r\n\r\nHe does nothing and gets everything, and you do everything and get\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nIf you can stand this he can; and if you don’t put an end to it he\r\nwon’t. And why should he? And why shouldn’t you? Mr. Workingman, you are\r\na man. You ought not to be satisfied to be a mere wealth-producing\r\nanimal. You have a brain, and you ought to develop it. You should aspire\r\nto rise above the animal plane. If you can work in a mill and produce\r\nwealth for a capitalist, who holds you in contempt, you can also work in\r\nthat mill as a free man and produce wealth for yourself and your wife\r\nand family to enjoy. If not, why not?\r\n\r\nIt is upon this basis that the Industrial Workers is organized. It is\r\nfor this supreme mission that the Industrial Workers has entered the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nWe have declared war upon the capitalist class, and upon the capitalist\r\nsystem. We are of the working class. We say: Arouse, you workingmen! It\r\nis in your power to put an end to this system. It is your duty to build\r\nup this great revolutionary economic organization of your class, to\r\nseize and control the tools with which you work, and make yourselves the\r\nmasters instead of being the slaves of industry.\r\n\r\nWipe out the wage system so that you can walk this earth free men!\r\n\r\nNot only is it your right, not only have you the opportunity, but it is\r\nyour solemn duty to do this, unless you are base enough to be guilty of\r\ntreason to yourself, to your class and humanity.\r\n\r\nLet me say to you, my fellow workers, that the hour has struck for a\r\ngreat change in the world of organized labor. Long enough have we been\r\ndivided into quarreling factions. Long enough have we suffered ourselves\r\nto blindly and stupidly follow a leadership that has misled and deceived\r\nand betrayed. Long enough have we been clubbed by the police, and it may\r\nbe pertinent to observe that when the club of a policeman descends upon\r\nthe head of a workingman he hears an echo of the vote he cast at the\r\npreceding election.\r\n\r\nIt is only necessary for us to do a bit of serious reasoning on our own\r\naccount to satisfy ourselves that the Industrial Workers is the only\r\nworking class organization in the field. It requires but little\r\nintelligent reflection to satisfy ourselves that we have got to build up\r\nthis organization, unless we have given up in the struggle and succumbed\r\nto defeat and despair. Is it possible that we could for a moment make up\r\nour minds that we and those who are to come after us are forever doomed\r\nto wage slavery? The very suggestion is abhorrent to every worker with a\r\nspark of manhood, with a drop of manly blood coursing in his veins. Why,\r\nyou men, you workingmen, are more than the salt of this earth. Without\r\nyou society would perish. Society does not need the idle capitalists.\r\nThey are parasites. They are worse than useless. They simply take what\r\nyou make, leaving you in poverty; thousands of you idle; if not now,\r\nwhen the times become hard. And every few years the times become hard in\r\nthe capitalist system, for reasons you can easily understand, but I have\r\nnot the time to fully explain this evening.\r\n\r\nA panic comes, industry is paralyzed, because with machinery you can\r\nproduce so much more than your paltry wage will allow you to consume.\r\nYou make all things in great abundance, but you do not consume them. You\r\ncan only consume that part of your product which your wage, the price of\r\nyour labor power, will buy. If you cannot consume what you produce, it\r\nfollows that in time there is bound to be overproduction, because the\r\nfew capitalists cannot absorb the surplus. The market is glutted,\r\nbusiness comes to a standstill and mills and factories shut down.\r\n\r\nAt such a time Chicago is hit, and hit hard; and you workingmen find\r\nyourselves out of employment, a drug on the market. Nobody wants your\r\nlabor power, because it cannot be utilized at a profit to the capitalist\r\nwho owns the tool, and when he cannot use your labor power at a\r\nsatisfactory profit to himself he doesn’t buy it. And if he doesn’t buy\r\nyour labor power you are idle, and when you are idle you don’t draw any\r\nwages, and you can’t buy groceries and pay rent; you can’t buy clothing\r\nand shoes, and you begin to look seedy and shabby. By degrees you become\r\na vagrant and a wanderer and lose what little self-respect you had. And\r\nthen you hear that your wife has been evicted, and that is a thing that\r\nhappens every day in the week. Your child is now upon the street and\r\nyour former cottage home is deserted and you start out on what proves to\r\nbe a never ending journey. The road you are now traveling stretches\r\nwearily on, and from the hedges bark the dogs of civilization. You are a\r\ntramp.\r\n\r\nAre there not thousands and thousands of tramps all over this country\r\ntoday? There were none half a century ago. There is a great army of them\r\nnow. They have been recruited in capitalist society; they are the\r\nproducts of the capitalist system.\r\n\r\nA man is out of work a good while and he gets hungry; he still has a\r\nlittle self-respect and steals rather than beg. That is how men become\r\ntramps and thieves and criminals; that is why we have an army of tramps;\r\nthat is why all the penitentiaries are crowded; why the insane asylums\r\nare overflowing and why thousands commit suicide. All these shocking\r\nevils are the outgrowth of the capitalist system, to which the\r\nIndustrial Workers proposes to put an everlasting end.\r\n\r\nIf you think that these horrors ought to be; if you, as a workingman,\r\nthink that you ought to have a master—just as the ignorant chattel slave\r\non the plantation in the South used to think that he had to have a\r\nmaster to rob him of what he produced—if you think that you are so\r\nhelpless that you would die unless you had a master to give you a job\r\nand take from you all except just enough to keep you working for him; if\r\nyou think that workingmen ought to fight each other; if you think that\r\nunity, the unity of the working class, would be a bad thing for the\r\nworking class; if you think that your interest is identical with the\r\ninterest of the capitalist who robs you; if you think that you ought to\r\nbe in slavish submission to the capitalist who does nothing and gets\r\nwhat you produce; if you think that, then certainly you ought to stay in\r\nthe old trade union and keep out of the Industrial Workers.\r\n\r\nBut if you have a bit of intelligence, just enough to realize that you\r\nare a workingman, and that, as a workingman, you are a human being; if\r\nyou are capable of understanding that you have the inherent power of\r\nself-development, that the brain you have can be developed so that you\r\ncan think clearly for yourself; if you will use that intelligence just\r\nenough to satisfy yourself that you ought to be the master of your own\r\njob; then, instead of being a wage slave, you will soon be a man among\r\nmen, and if you have intelligence enough to conceive and to express that\r\nthought, then let me say to you, a revolutionary light will be kindled\r\nin your eyes and you will feel the thrill of a new-born joy, and for the\r\nfirst time in your life you will stand perfectly erect and know what it\r\nis to be self-reliant and touch elbows with your fellow-workers\r\nthroughout the world.\r\n\r\nRemember that no matter who or what a worker may be, if he works for\r\nwages he is in precisely the same economic position that you are. He is\r\nin your class; he is your brother; he is your comrade.\r\n\r\nAs an individual worker you cannot escape from wage-slavery. It is true\r\nthat one in ten thousand wage-workers may become a capitalist, to be\r\npointed out as a man worth a million who used to be a clerk, but he is\r\nthe exception that proves the rule. The wage worker in the capitalist\r\nsystem remains the wage worker.\r\n\r\nThere is no escape for you from wage-slavery by yourself, but while you\r\ncannot alone break your fetters, if you will unite with all other\r\nworkers who are in the same position that you are; that is, if—instead\r\nof being bound up in a little union of a score, or a hundred, or a\r\nthousand, that is almost as helpless to do anything for you as you are\r\nto do anything by yourself—if you will join the organization that\r\nrepresents your whole class, you can develop the power that will achieve\r\nyour freedom and the equal freedom of all.\r\n\r\nThe workingman who does this is a missionary in the field of sound\r\nworking class organization; he wears the badge of the Industrial\r\nWorkers; he has a new idea of unionism. Instead of being satisfied with\r\nancient, out-of-date, reactionary methods he will have the advanced and\r\nprogressive ideas of industrial revolutionists. That is to say, he will\r\nunderstand that when the workers are united in one great economic\r\norganization and one great political organization; when they strike\r\ntogether and vote together they can put their class in power in every\r\ncouncil, in every legislature and in the national congress; they can\r\nabolish the capitalist system, take over the industries to themselves\r\nand rule the land forevermore.\r\n\r\nFor this great change the workers must prepare themselves through\r\norganization and education. Were it to come today it would result in\r\ncollapse. It would mean a catastrophe, and why? Because if, for example,\r\nthe Illinois Steel Works were turned over to the workers today they\r\nwould not be fitted, trained, drilled, equipped for the operation of\r\nthis mammoth industrial enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe Industrial Workers proposes to first unite all workers within one\r\norganization, classified in the various departments representing their\r\nseveral trades and occupation, to bring them all into harmonious\r\neconomic relations with each other. The next thing is to coördinate them\r\nwithin their several industries with an eye to operating these\r\nindustries when they secure control of them. That is the central\r\nfunction of the new union, and by far the most important one.\r\n\r\nThe old union never makes any reference to industrial self-control,\r\nbecause so far as the old union is concerned wage-slavery is to prevail\r\nforever.\r\n\r\nThe Industrial Workers declares that it is organized to put an end to\r\nthe wage system, to free the workers, to make them the masters of the\r\nmills and other plants in which they are employed. In order to fit them\r\nto operate these enterprises in their own interests when they are turned\r\nover to them it is necessary that they undergo a thorough process of\r\nindustrial education.\r\n\r\nSo that, after you join the Industrial Workers, when you go to your work\r\nin the morning, you will not be tied to your task blindly; you will have\r\na thought about your relation to your fellow-workingmen in all other\r\ndepartments. You will understand your part in the enterprise, and your\r\nconnection with and relation to the whole. You will help to fit your\r\nfellows for the new function, so that when the hour strikes you will be\r\nperfectly trained and ready to take control of industry and operate the\r\nproductive enterprises in the interests of the people. To me nothing\r\ncould be simpler.\r\n\r\nDon’t you think we are capable of effecting this change? I do. I not\r\nonly think it; I know it. And I know it is inevitable.\r\n\r\nUpon the one hand the capitalists are combining. It will be but a short\r\ntime until practically all the lands, railroads, telegraphs, steel\r\nmills, sugar refineries, breweries and all other great establishments\r\nwill belong to practically a single syndicate, controlled by a few\r\ncapitalists. But while they are combining and centralizing their capital\r\nwe are organizing the workers that they may act together, economically\r\nand politically, and possibly in other ways before the struggle is ended\r\nand the victory won.\r\n\r\nIn the Industrial Workers they will vote as they strike, and strike as\r\nthey vote—all together.\r\n\r\nDo you know what I expect to see? I expect to see a general strike in\r\nthe city of Chicago. I would rather see it here than in any other city\r\nin America; than any other in the world.\r\n\r\nThe capitalists are drunken with their power. They are running things to\r\nsuit themselves, and they are going to keep the working class in\r\nsubjection just as the remnants of the Indians are kept on their\r\nreservations out on the plains. And if you object they are so completely\r\nin control that they will club you, or they will jail you, or kill you\r\nif necessary.\r\n\r\nI want to see the time when the workers of Chicago will be so thoroughly\r\norganized in their economic capacity that they can quit work and\r\nparalyze industry in Chicago for just twenty-four hours, and when they\r\nare organized well enough to do that they will have every capitalist in\r\nthe city and nation suing for peace. When they are organized well enough\r\nto do that they will secure more economic concessions in five minutes\r\nthan they can get in five years striking and boycotting along the old\r\ntrade union lines.\r\n\r\nHow is it now? Why, the union butcher workmen go out on strike, and they\r\nstrike bravely and loyally to the bitter end. But all other union men\r\nremain at work until the butcher workmen are used up.\r\n\r\nThe capitalists are rich; the loss of a few hundreds or thousands of\r\ndollars doesn’t hurt them, because they get it all back again. So they\r\ncan wait until this corps of the working army is defeated and its\r\nstanchest supporters are out of jobs. Many of these quit the union; it\r\nis no use. They tried the union and are disgusted with it, and in all\r\nprobability some of them will stay at work in the next strike and help\r\ndefeat the union.\r\n\r\nNext comes the strike of the Chicago machinists, and that lasts a long\r\ntime. All their fellow unionists remain at work. Here we have a large\r\nbody of machinists engaged in a life and death struggle, and they hold\r\nout wonderfully well. They levy assessments on all other machinists who\r\nkeep at work to help these strikers in idleness for many weary months,\r\nand then at last, when all the resources are exhausted and the men are\r\non the point of starvation, they have got to surrender, and they go back\r\ndefeated, and the open shop system is established, and the union, so far\r\nas any usefulness to the machinist is concerned, is practically wiped\r\nout of existence.\r\n\r\nWhat good has the machinists’ union done to these machinists? It\r\ncollects high dues and pays high salaries. Hundreds of thousands of\r\ndollars are contributed by the workers with which to buy their own\r\ndefeat. Now, defeat would be bad enough if it came about free of charge,\r\nbut if you have to pay $174,000 for it, as the official report of the\r\nmachinists show, it is time you were doing a little thinking on your own\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nMr. James O’Connell is at the head of the machinists’ union, and he is\r\nalso a labor lieutenant of the capitalist class. He sits at the same\r\nbanqueting table with the capitalists and is hand in glove with August\r\nBelmont—the employer of James Farley, the professional strikebreaker,\r\nwho, when you go on strike, steps in and gets as much pay in a day as\r\nyou get in a year.\r\n\r\nYou can hardly blame the men who get disgusted with unions as they are\r\nrun in Chicago. Not alone Mr. O’Connell, but Mr. Mitchell, president of\r\nthe Mine Workers; Mr. Gompers, president of the American Federation of\r\nLabor, and other pure and simple union leaders are in economic tune with\r\nthe master class, and are held up as model labor leaders by capitalist\r\nnewspapers.\r\n\r\nPeriodically these model leaders go to New York to attend a love feast\r\nbetween capitalists and wage workers, or, rather, between capitalists\r\nand leaders of wage workers.\r\n\r\nYou are only the common herd. They don’t have anything to do with you,\r\nand they don’t need to have anything to do with you. They deal with your\r\nleaders and between them they fix things, and all you have to do is to\r\nwork and put up the money and they will attend to the rest.\r\n\r\nLast fall, a year ago, when I was in New York, there came near being a\r\nstrike on the Interborough railway lines. The employes had been outraged\r\nby the management of the Interborough under an agreement that had been\r\nshamefully violated by the company. They threatened to go out on strike.\r\nIt happened to be a national election year, and under the pressure that\r\nwas brought to bear upon him, Mr. Belmont, the president of the system,\r\non the eve of the election, settled with the men and averted the strike.\r\nIn a speech I made in New York that night I predicted that the\r\nsettlement was temporary and for political effect, and that soon after\r\nthe election was over the corporation would begin to violate agreement\r\nand goad the men to strike. And so it came to pass.\r\n\r\nAfter the election was over the corporation renewed its offensive\r\ntactics until at last 6,000 of the men went out on strike. And now we\r\nbehold an exhibition of the impotency, if not the crime, of outgrown\r\nunionism. When these 6,000 men went out on strike August Belmont already\r\nhad James Farley and his army of professional strikebreakers on the\r\nground; had them there weeks in advance. And they were getting their\r\npay, $5 a day and expenses, while Farley got an advance payment, said to\r\nhave been $10,000.\r\n\r\nAugust Belmont, the president of the Interborough, was photographed with\r\nFarley, the strikebreaker. They were pictured side by side; they\r\noccupied the first page of the New York newspapers; they were\r\nrepresented as the modern strikebreakers, August Belmont, the\r\ncapitalist, and James Farley, his mercenary minion.\r\n\r\nThe strike was soon defeated and the places of the men filled with\r\nscabs.\r\n\r\nThe union men who were in the power houses, who could and who should\r\nhave shut off the power, kept those great plants in operation. They\r\nsaid, “We are in sympathy with you and would like to help you, but we\r\ncannot go out on strike without violating our contract.” And so, to\r\npreserve the sanctity of their craft contract, they cut the throats of\r\ntheir 6,000 fellow unionists, virtually scabbing on them, so far as the\r\neffect of their action was concerned. These union men might as well have\r\nstepped out of the power houses and taken the places that were vacated\r\nby the strikers.\r\n\r\nNow comes the closing chapter of this story, the blackest of all. A\r\nlittle while after the 6,000 union men had gone out on strike and had\r\nbeen defeated by strike-breakers under Farley, the lieutenant of\r\nBelmont, the Civic Federation held its banquet. August Belmont attended\r\nthis banquet, being the president of the Federation. So also did the\r\nlabor leaders. In their regular order came President Gompers, President\r\nMitchell, President O’Connell, President Duncan and the rest of the\r\npresidents. They surrounded the banqueting board and sat and feasted and\r\nlaughed and made joy together. The labor question was speedily settled,\r\nso far as they were concerned.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think of the labor leader who would sit down, side by side,\r\nat the same banquet, with August Belmont, fresh from the field upon\r\nwhich he had slaughtered 6,000 union men? Do you think that a true union\r\nleader, a man whose heart was with the working class, could feast and\r\nmake common cause with a capitalist who had just thrust the dagger of\r\nassassination into the heart of his union? Do you think that a real\r\nlabor leader would fraternize with one whose hands were dripping with\r\nthe blood of union labor?\r\n\r\nI say that a labor leader who attends that kind of a banquet and who\r\ngreets in social fellowship an arch-enemy of labor, is himself a Belmont\r\nat heart and the foe of the working class.\r\n\r\nYou may feel assured that there is no officer of the Industrial Workers\r\nwho will ever banquet with the Civic Federation.\r\n\r\nCould you imagine Charles O. Sherman—who has given his life to the\r\nworking class—could you imagine him consorting with Belmont? Could you\r\nimagine Trautmann—the very incarnation of the revolutionary spirit of\r\nthe working class—could you imagine Trautmann attending a banquet of the\r\nCivic Federation, in full fellowship with the men who live out of the\r\nblood of the working class? It is unimaginable. They would scorn to do\r\nit; they would consider this an act of basest treason to their class.\r\n\r\nIn closing, I appeal to you, as workingmen, to think for yourselves; to\r\ncut loose from those who have misled and betrayed you; to close up the\r\nranks and unify your forces. I appeal to you to ally yourselves with the\r\neconomic organization of your class; I appeal to you to join the union\r\nthat truly represents you, the union that unites you, the union in which\r\nyou can stand shoulder to shoulder, regardless of your occupation; the\r\nunion in which you will move forward, step by step, marching proudly to\r\nthe inspiring music of the new emancipation.\r\n\r\nI appeal to you to declare yourselves here and now, to be for once true\r\nenough to yourselves to join the only industrial union that is\r\nabsolutely true to you.\r\n\r\nAnd if you join this union in sufficient numbers, if you build up this\r\nunion and give it the power it ought to have—if you will rally to the\r\nstandard of this revolutionary army—then, as certain as I stand before\r\nyou, you will carry that banner to victory. Then the workers will be the\r\nsovereign citizens, the rulers of this earth. They will build houses and\r\nlive in them; they will plant vineyards and enjoy the fruits thereof.\r\nThe labor question will have been settled, and the working class,\r\nemancipated from the fetters of wage-slavery, will begin the real work\r\nof civilizing the human race.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Revolutionary Unionism\r\n\r\n                 _Speech at Chicago, November 25, 1905_\r\n\r\nThe unity of labor, economic and political, upon the basis of the class\r\nstruggle, is at this time the supreme need of the working class. The\r\nprevailing lack of unity implies lack of class consciousness; that is to\r\nsay, enlightened self-interest; and this can, must and will be overcome\r\nby revolutionary education and organization. Experience, long, painful\r\nand dearly bought, has taught some of us that craft division is fatal to\r\nclass unity. To accomplish its mission the working class must be united.\r\nThey must act together; they must assert their combined power, and when\r\nthey do this upon the basis of the class struggle, then and then only\r\nwill they break the fetters of wage slavery.\r\n\r\nWe are engaged today in a class war; and why? For the simple reason that\r\nin the evolution of the capitalist system in which we live, society has\r\nbeen mainly divided into two economic classes—a small class of\r\ncapitalists who own the tools with which work is done and wealth is\r\nproduced, and a great mass of workers who are compelled to use those\r\ntools. Between these two classes there is an irrepressible economic\r\nconflict. Unfortunately for himself, the workingman does not yet\r\nunderstand the nature of this conflict, and for this reason has hitherto\r\nfailed to accomplish any effective unity of his class.\r\n\r\nIt is true that workers in the various departments of industrial\r\nactivity have organized trade unions. It is also true that in this\r\ncapacity they have from time to time asserted such power as this form of\r\norganization has conferred upon them. It is equally true that mere craft\r\nunionism, no matter how well it may be organized, is in the present\r\nhighly developed capitalist system utterly unable to successfully cope\r\nwith the capitalist class. The old craft union has done its work and\r\nbelongs to the past. Labor unionism, like everything else, must\r\nrecognize and bow to the inexorable law of evolution.\r\n\r\nThe craft union says that the worker shall receive a fair day’s pay for\r\na fair day’s work. What is a fair day’s pay for a fair day’s work? Ask\r\nthe capitalist and he will give you his idea about it. Ask the worker\r\nand, if he is intelligent, he will tell you that a fair day’s pay for a\r\nfair day’s work is all the workingman produces.\r\n\r\nWhile the craft unionist still talks about a fair day’s pay for a fair\r\nday’s work, implying that the economic interests of the capitalist and\r\nthe worker can be harmonized upon a basis of equal justice to both, the\r\nIndustrial Worker says, “I want all I produce by my labor.”\r\n\r\nIf the worker is not entitled to all he produces, then what share is\r\nanybody else entitled to?\r\n\r\nDoes the worker today receive all he produces? Does he receive anything\r\nlike a fair (?) share of the product of his labor? Will any\r\ntrade-unionist of the old school make any such claim, and if he is bold\r\nenough to make it, can he verify it?\r\n\r\nThe student of this question knows that, as a matter of fact, in the\r\ncapitalist system in which we live today the worker who produces all\r\nwealth receives but enough of his product to keep him in working and\r\nproducing order. His wage, in the aggregate, is fixed by his living\r\nnecessities. It suffices, upon the average, to maintain him according to\r\nthe prevailing standard of living and to enable him to reproduce himself\r\nin the form of labor power. He receives, as a matter of fact, but about\r\n17 per cent of what his labor produces.\r\n\r\nThe worker produces a certain thing. It goes from the manufacturer to\r\nthe jobber, from the jobber to the wholesaler, and from the wholesaler\r\nto the retailer—each of these adding a profit, and when it completes the\r\ncircle and comes back to the worker who produced it and he stands face\r\nto face with the product of his own labor, he can buy back, upon the\r\naverage, with his paltry wage but about 17 per cent of it. In other\r\nwords, he is exploited, robbed, of about 83 per cent of what his labor\r\nproduces. And why? For the simple reason that in modern industry, the\r\ntool, in the form of a great machine with which he works and produces,\r\nis the private property of the capitalist, who didn’t make it, and could\r\nnot, if his life depended upon it, use it.\r\n\r\nThe evolution is not yet complete.\r\n\r\nBy virtue of his private ownership of the social tool—made and used by\r\nthe co-operative labor of the working class—the employer has the\r\neconomic power to appropriate to himself, as a capitalist, what is\r\nproduced by the social labor of the working class. This accounts for the\r\nfact that the capitalist becomes fabulously rich, lives in a palace\r\nwhere there is music and singing and dancing, and where there is the\r\nluxury of all climes, while the workingmen who do the work and produce\r\nthe wealth and endure the privations and make the sacrifices of health\r\nand limb and life, remain in a wretched state of poverty and dependence.\r\n\r\nThe exploiting capitalist is the economic master and the political ruler\r\nin capitalist society, and as such holds the exploited wage worker in\r\nutter contempt.\r\n\r\nNo master ever had any respect for his slave, and no slave ever had, or\r\never could have, any real love for his master.\r\n\r\nI must beg you to indulge the hoarseness of my voice, which has been\r\nsomewhat strained addressing meetings of the Industrial Workers held in\r\nand about Chicago during the last two or three evenings; but,\r\nfortunately, my eyesight has not been strained reading the accounts of\r\nthese meetings in the capitalist papers of Chicago.\r\n\r\nAlert, vigilant, argus-eyed as the capitalist dailies of Chicago are,\r\nthere is not one of them that knows of this meeting of the Industrial\r\nWorkers. But if this were a meeting of the American Federation of Labor\r\nand an old trade union leader were here, you would read tomorrow morning\r\na full account of it and him in every capitalist paper in the city.\r\nThere is a reason for this that explains itself.\r\n\r\nThe capitalist papers know that there is such an organization as the\r\nIndustrial Workers, because they have lied about it. Just now they are\r\nignoring it. Let me serve notice on them through you and the thousands\r\nof others who flock to our meetings everywhere, that they will reckon\r\nwith the Industrial Workers before six months have rolled around.\r\n\r\nThere are those wage workers who feel their economic dependence, who\r\nknow that the capitalist for whom they work is the owner of their job,\r\nand therefore the master of their fate, who are still vainly seeking by\r\nindividual effort and through waning craft unions to harmonize the\r\nconflicting interests of the exploiting capitalist and the exploited\r\nwage slave. They are engaged in a vain and hopeless task. They are\r\nwasting time and energy worthy of a better cause. These interests never\r\ncan and never will be harmonized permanently, and when they are adjusted\r\neven temporarily it is always at the expense of the working class.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is no part of the mission of this revolutionary working class union\r\nto conciliate the capitalist class. We are organized to fight that\r\nclass, and we want that class to distinctly understand it. And they do\r\nunderstand it, and in time the working class will also understand it;\r\nand then the capitalist class will have reason to understand it better\r\nstill. Their newspapers understand it so well even now that they have\r\nnot a single favorable comment to make upon it.\r\n\r\nWhen the convention of delegates was in session here in June last for\r\nthe purpose of organizing the Industrial Workers, every report that\r\nappeared in a Chicago paper—capitalist paper I mean; every single report\r\nwas a tissue of perversion, misstatement and downright falsehood. They\r\nknew that we had met for a purpose, and that that purpose was to fight\r\nthe class of which they are the official mouthpieces. Now, it seems to\r\nme that this uniform hostility of the capitalist press ought to be\r\nsignificant to even the unthinking workingman. Capitalist papers are, as\r\na rule, quite friendly to the craft unions. They do not misrepresent\r\nthem; do not lie about them; do not traduce their representatives. They\r\nare exceedingly fond of them, because they know enough about their own\r\ninterests to know that the craft unions are not only not a menace to\r\nthem, but are in fact bulwarks of defense to them. And why? Because,\r\nchiefly, craft unions divide and do not unite the working class. And I\r\nchallenge contradiction.\r\n\r\nThere was a time when the craft union expressed in terms of unionism the\r\nprevailing mode of industry. That was long ago when production was still\r\nmainly carried on by handicraftmen with hand tools; when one man worked\r\nfor another to learn his trade that he might become its master. The\r\nvarious trades involved skill and cunning; considerable time was\r\nrequired to master them. This was in the early stages of the capitalist\r\nsystem. Even at that early day the antagonism between employer and\r\nemployed found expression, although the employer was not at that time\r\nthe capitalist as he is today. The men who followed these trades found\r\nit necessary in order to protect themselves in their trade interests to\r\nband together, form a union, so that they might act together in\r\nresisting the encroachments of the “boss.” So the trade union came into\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nThe mode of production since that time has been practically\r\nrevolutionized. The hand tool has all but disappeared. The mammoth\r\nmachine has taken its place. The hand tool was made and used by the\r\nindividual worker and was largely within his own control. Today the\r\nmachine that has supplanted the old tool is not owned nor controlled by\r\nthe man, or rather the men, who use it. As I have already said, it is\r\nthe private property of some capitalist who may live at a remote point\r\nand never have seen the machine or the wage slaves who operate it.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the production of wealth, in the evolution of industry,\r\nfrom being an individual act a half a century ago has become a social\r\nact. The tool, from being an individual tool, has become a social\r\ninstrument. So that the tool has been socialized and production has also\r\nbeen socialized. But the evolution is yet to complete its work. This\r\nsocial tool, made socially and used socially, must be socially owned.\r\n\r\nIn the evolution of industry the trade has been largely undermined. The\r\nold trade union expresses the old form of industry, the old mode of\r\nindividual production based upon the use of the individual tool. That\r\ntool has about disappeared; that mode of production has also about\r\ndisappeared, but the trade union built upon that mode of production,\r\nspringing from the use of the hand tool, remains essentially the same.\r\n\r\nThe pure and simple trade union, in seeking to preserve its autonomy, is\r\nforced into conflict with other trade unions by the unceasing operation\r\nof the laws of industrial evolution. How many of the skilled trades that\r\nwere in operation half a century ago are still practiced?\r\n\r\nAt the town where I live there used to be quite a number of cooper\r\nshops. Barrels were made by hand and a cooper shop consisted wholly of\r\ncoopers. The coopers’ union was organized and served fairly well the\r\npurposes of the coopers of that day, but it does not serve the purposes\r\nof the workers who make barrels today. They do not make barrels in the\r\nway they used to be made. Today we want a union that expresses the\r\neconomic interests of all the workers in the cooperage plant engaged in\r\nmaking and handling barrels. But a few coopers still remain, a very few.\r\nIt is no longer necessary to be a cooper to make a barrel. The machine\r\nis the cooper today. The machine makes the barrel, and almost anyone can\r\noperate the machine that makes the barrel.\r\n\r\nYou will observe that labor has been subdivided and specialized and that\r\nthe trade has been dissipated; and now a body of men and boys work\r\ntogether co-operatively in the making of a barrel, each making a small\r\npart of a barrel. Now we want a union which embraces all the workers\r\nengaged in making barrels. We lose sight of the cooper trade as\r\nevolution has practically disposed of that. We say that since the trade\r\nhas completely changed, the union which expressed that trade must also\r\nchange accordingly. In the new union we shall include not only the men\r\nwho are actually engaged in the making of barrels directly, but also\r\nthose who are placing them upon the market. There are the typewriters,\r\nthe bookkeepers, the teamsters, and all other classes of labor that are\r\ninvolved in the making and delivering of the barrels. We insist that all\r\nthe workers in the whole of any given plant shall belong to one and the\r\nsame union.\r\n\r\nThis is the very thing the workers need and the capitalist who owns the\r\nestablishment does not want. He believes in labor unionism if it is the\r\n“right kind.” And if it is the right kind for him it is the wrong kind\r\nfor you. He is more than willing that his employes shall join the craft\r\nunion. He has not the slightest objection. On the contrary, it is easily\r\nproven that capitalists are among the most active upholders of the old\r\ncraft unions.\r\n\r\nThe capitalists are perfectly willing that you shall organize, as long\r\nas you don’t do a thing against them; as long as you don’t do a thing\r\nfor yourselves. You cannot do a thing for yourselves without\r\nantagonizing them; and you don’t antagonize them through your craft\r\nunions nearly as much as you buttress their interests and prolong their\r\nmastery.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe average workingman imagines that he must have a leader to look to; a\r\nguide to follow, right or wrong. He has been taught in the craft union\r\nthat he is a very dependent creature; that without a leader the goblins\r\nwould get him without a doubt, and he therefore instinctively looks to\r\nhis leader. And even while he is looking at his leader there is someone\r\nelse looking at the same leader from the other side.\r\n\r\nYou have depended too much on that leader and not enough on yourself. I\r\ndon’t want you to follow me. I want you to cultivate self-reliance.\r\n\r\nIf I have the slightest capacity for leadership I can only give evidence\r\nof it by leading you to rely upon yourselves.\r\n\r\nAs long as you can be led by an individual you will be betrayed by an\r\nindividual. That does not mean that all leaders are dishonest or\r\ncorrupt. I make no such sweeping indictment. I know that many of them\r\nare honest. I know also that many of them are in darkness themselves,\r\nblind leaders of the blind. That is the worst that can be said of them.\r\nAnd let me say to you that the most dangerous leader is not the corrupt\r\nleader, but the honest, ignorant leader. That leader is just as fatal to\r\nyour interests as the one who deliberately sells you out for a paltry\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nYou are a workingman! Now, at your earliest leisure look yourself over\r\nand take an inventory of your resources. Invoice your mental stock; see\r\nwhat you have on hand.\r\n\r\nYou may be of limited mentality; and that is all you require in the\r\ncapitalist system. You need only small brains, but huge hands.\r\n\r\nMost of your hands are calloused and you are taught by the capitalist\r\npolitician, who is the political mercenary of the capitalist who fleeces\r\nyou, you are taught by him to be proud of your horny hands. If that is\r\ntrue he ought to be ashamed of his. He doesn’t have any horns on his\r\nhands. He has them on his brain. He is as busy with his brain as you are\r\nwith your hands, and because he is busy with his brain and you neglect\r\nyours, he gets a goodly share of what you produce with your hands. He is\r\nthe gentleman who calls you the horny handed sons of toil. That fetches\r\nyou every time. I tell you that the time has come for you to use your\r\nbrains in your own interest, and until you do that you will have to use\r\nyour hands in the interest of your masters.\r\n\r\nNow, after you have looked yourself over; after you have satisfied\r\nyourself what you are, or rather, what you are not, you will arrive at\r\nthe conclusion that as a wage worker in capitalist society you are not a\r\nman at all. You are simply a thing. And that thing is bought in the\r\nlabor market, just as hair, hides and other forms of merchandise are\r\nbought.\r\n\r\nWhen the capitalist requires the use of your hands, does he call for\r\nmen? Why, certainly not. He doesn’t want men, he only wants hands. And\r\nwhen he calls for hands, that is what he wants. Have you ever seen a\r\nplacard posted: “Fifty hands wanted”? Did you ever know of a capitalist\r\nto respond to that kind of an invitation?\r\n\r\nPresident Roosevelt would have you believe that there are no classes in\r\nthe United States. He was made president by the votes of the working\r\nclass. Did you ever know of his stopping over night in the home of a\r\nworkingman? Is it by mere chance that he is always sheltered beneath the\r\nhospitable roof of some plutocrat? Not long ago he made a visit here and\r\nhe gave a committee representing the workers about fifteen minutes of\r\nhis precious time, just time enough to rebuke them with the intimation\r\nthat organized labor consisted of a set of law-breakers, and then he\r\ngave fifteen hours to the plutocrats of Chicago, being wined and dined\r\nby them to prove that there are no classes in the United States, and\r\nthat you, horny handed veteran, with your wage of $1.50 a day, with six\r\nchildren to support on that, are in the same class with John D.\r\nRockefeller! Your misfortune is that you do not know you are in the same\r\nclass. But on election day it dawns upon you and you prove it by voting\r\nthe same ticket.\r\n\r\nSince you have looked yourself over thoroughly, you realize by this time\r\nthat, as a workingman, you have been supporting, through your craft\r\nunions and through your ballots, a social system that is the negation of\r\nyour manhood.\r\n\r\nThe capitalist for whom you work doesn’t have to go out and look for\r\nyou; you have to look for him, and you belong to him just as completely\r\nas if he had a title to your body; as if you were his chattel slave.\r\n\r\nHe doesn’t own you under the law, but he does under the fact.\r\n\r\nWhy? Because he owns the tool with which you work, and you have got to\r\nhave access to that tool if you work; and if you want to live you have\r\ngot to work. If you don’t work you don’t eat; and so, scourged by hunger\r\npangs, you look about for that tool and you locate it, and you soon\r\ndiscover that between yourself, a workingman, and that tool that is an\r\nessential part of yourself in industry, there stands the capitalist who\r\nowns it. He is your boss; he owns your job, takes your product and\r\ncontrols your destiny. Before you can touch that tool to earn a dime you\r\nmust petition the owner of it to allow you to use it, in consideration\r\nof your giving to him all you produce with it, except just enough to\r\nkeep you alive and in working order.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nObserve that you are displaced by the surplus product of your own labor;\r\nthat what you produce is of more value under capitalism than you who\r\nproduce it; that the commodity which is the result of your labor is of\r\ngreater value under capitalism than your own life. You consist of\r\npalpitating flesh; you have wants. You have necessities. You cannot\r\nsatisfy them, and you suffer. But the product of your labor, the\r\nproperty of the capitalist, that is sacred; that must be protected at\r\nall hazards. After you have been displaced by the surplus product of\r\nyour labor and you have been idle long enough, you become restive and\r\nyou begin to speak out, and you become a menace. The unrest culminates\r\nin trouble. The capitalist presses a button and the police are called\r\ninto action. Then the capitalist presses button No. 2 and injunctions\r\nare issued by the judges, the judicial allies and servants of the\r\ncapitalist class. Then button No. 3 is pressed and the state troops fall\r\ninto line; and if this is not sufficient button No. 4 is pressed and the\r\nregular soldiers come marching to the scene. That is what President\r\nRoosevelt meant when he said that back of the mayor is the governor,\r\nback of the governor the President; or, to use his own words, back of\r\nthe city, the state, and back of the state the nation—the capitalist\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nIf you have been working in a steel mill and you have made more steel\r\nthan your master can sell, and you are locked out and get hungry, and\r\nthe soldiers are called out, it is to protect the steel and shoot you\r\nwho made the steel—to guard the men who steal the steel and kill the men\r\nwho made it.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI am not asking you to withdraw from the craft unions simply because the\r\nIndustrial Workers has been formed. I am asking you to think about these\r\nmatters for yourselves.\r\n\r\nI belonged to a craft union from the time I was nineteen years of age. I\r\ncan remember the very evening I first joined the Brotherhood of\r\nLocomotive Firemen. I can recall with what zeal I went to work to\r\norganize my craft, and it was the pride of my life to see that union\r\nexpand. I did what I could to build it up. In time I was made to realize\r\nthat that union was not sufficient unto itself. I next did what I could\r\nto organize other branches of the service and then establish a\r\nfederation of the various unions of railroad employes, and finally\r\nsucceeded; but soon after the federation was formed, on account of craft\r\njealousies, it was disrupted. I then, along with a number of others who\r\nhad had the same experience and had profited by it, undertook to\r\norganize the railway men within one organization, known as the American\r\nRailway Union. The railroad corporations were the deadly enemies of that\r\norganization. They understood that its purpose was to unify all the\r\nrailroad employes. They knew that the unity of the working class meant\r\ntheir end, and so they set their faces like flint against the American\r\nRailway Union. And while they were using all their powers to crush and\r\nto stamp out the American Railway Union, they were bestowing all their\r\nfavors upon the several craft brotherhoods, the engineers and the\r\nfiremen, the conductors and the brakemen. They knew that so long as\r\nthese craft unions existed there could be no unification of the men\r\nemployed in the railway service.\r\n\r\nAre the railroad men of this country organized today? No! Not nearly\r\none-half of them are organized at all. And when the railroad\r\ncorporations from motives of good policy make a concession to the\r\nengineers or the conductors, it is gouged out of the poor devils who\r\nwork for a dollar a day and are compelled to submit.\r\n\r\nThere are a great many engineers who are perfectly willing to be tied up\r\nin a contract. They think they can save themselves at the expense of\r\ntheir fellow-workers. But they are going to reap, sooner or later, just\r\nwhat they have sown. In the next few years they will become motormen.\r\n\r\nWhile we are upon this question, let us consult industrial history a\r\nmoment. We will begin with the craft union railroad strike of 1888. The\r\nBrotherhood of Engineers and the Brotherhood of Firemen on the C., B. &\r\nQ. system went out on strike. Some 2,000 engineers and firemen vacated\r\ntheir posts and went out on one of the most bitterly contested railroad\r\nstrikes in the history of the country. When they went out, the rest of\r\nthe employes, especially the conductors, who were organized in craft\r\nunions of their own, remained at their posts, and the union conductors\r\npiloted the scab engineers over the line. I know whereof I speak. I was\r\nthere. I took an active part in that strike.\r\n\r\nI saw craft union pitted against craft union, and I saw the Brotherhood\r\nof Engineers and the Brotherhood of Firemen completely wiped from the\r\nC., B. & Q. system. And now you find these men, seventeen years later,\r\nscattered all over the United States. They had to pay the penalty of\r\ntheir ignorance in organizing a craft instead of organizing as a whole.\r\n\r\nIn 1892 a strike occurred on the Lehigh Valley; the same result. Another\r\non the Toledo, Ann Arbor & North Michigan. Same result. The engineers\r\nhave had no strike from that time to this. Every time they have had a\r\nstrike they have been defeated.\r\n\r\nThe railroad corporations are shrewd enough to recognize the fact that\r\nif they can keep certain departments in their employ in a time of\r\nemergency they can defeat all of the rest. A manager of a railroad who\r\ncan keep control of 15 per cent of the old men can allow 85 per cent to\r\ngo out on strike and defeat them every time. That is why they have made\r\nsome concessions to the engineers and conductors and brakemen, and now\r\nand then to the switchmen, the most militant labor union of them all.\r\n\r\nA year and a half ago the telegraph operators on the Missouri, Kansas &\r\nTexas went out on strike. The engineer remained at his post; so did the\r\nfireman; the conductor at his; and the brakeman at his. And they hauled\r\nthe scabs that flocked from all parts of the country to the several\r\npoints along the line, and delivered them in good order to take the\r\nplaces vacated by the strikers; worked all round them and with them\r\nuntil they had mastered the details of their several duties; and having\r\ndone this, the strike was at an end, and the 1,300 craft unionists out\r\nof jobs. You will find them scattered all over the country.\r\n\r\nNow, were not these other craft unions scabbing on the telegraphers just\r\nas flagrantly as if they had stepped into their positions and discharged\r\ntheir duties? They were acting with the corporation against their union\r\nfellow workingmen, helping the corporation to defeat and crush them.\r\nWithout their aid the corporation could not have succeeded. With their\r\naid it was very easily done.\r\n\r\nIs it possible that a craft unionist can see such an object lesson as\r\nthis so plainly presented to him and still refuse to profit by it? Still\r\nclose his eyes and, as it were, shut up his reason, and absolutely\r\ndecline to see that this is suicidal policy and that its fruit must\r\nalways be disruption and disaster?\r\n\r\nThis world only respects as it is compelled to respect; and if you\r\nworkingmen would be respected you must begin by respecting yourselves.\r\nYou have had enough of this sort of experience. You have had more than\r\nenough of it right here in Chicago.\r\n\r\nWhy didn’t the steel trust annihilate the Amalgamated Steelworkers? Only\r\ntwo years ago they defeated them completely. The trust had its iron heel\r\nupon the neck of the Steelworkers’ Union, and could have, had it chosen,\r\ncompletely crushed the life out of it. But Morgan was too wily. Schwab\r\nwas too wise. They used to oppose trade unions. They don’t oppose them\r\nany longer. They have discovered that a union can be turned the other\r\nway; that it can be made useful to them instead of being useful to the\r\nworking class. Morgan now says he is in favor of trade unions, and\r\nSchwab agrees. They didn’t crush out the Steelworkers’ Union because\r\nthey knew that another and a better one would spring from its ruins.\r\nThey were perfectly willing that the old craft union should grow up\r\nagain and block the way to real union.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYou have had a machinists’ strike here in Chicago. You are well aware of\r\nthis without my telling you. There is something pathetic to me about\r\nevery strike.\r\n\r\nI have said and say again that no strike was ever lost; that it has\r\nalways been worth all it cost. An essential part of a workingman’s\r\neducation is the defeats he encounters. The strikes he loses are after\r\nall the only ones he wins. I am heartily glad for myself that I lost the\r\nstrike. It is the best thing that ever happened to me. I lost the strike\r\nof the past that I may win the strike of the future.\r\n\r\nI am a discredited labor leader, but I have good staying qualities. The\r\nvery moment the capitalist press credits me with being a wise labor\r\nleader, I will invite you to investigate me upon the charge of treason.\r\nI am discredited by the capitalist simply because I am true to his\r\nvictim. I don’t want his favors. I do not court his approbation. I would\r\nnot have it. I can’t afford it. If I had his respect it would be at the\r\nprice of my own.\r\n\r\nI don’t care anything about what is called public opinion. I know\r\nprecisely what that means. It is but the reflect of the interests of the\r\ncapitalist class. As between the respect of the public and my own, I\r\nprefer my own; and I am going to keep it until I can have both.\r\n\r\nWhen I pick up a capitalist newspaper and read a eulogy of some labor\r\nleader, I know that that leader has at least two afflictions; the one is\r\nmental weakness and the other is moral cowardice—and they go together.\r\nPut it down that when the capitalist who is exploiting you credits your\r\nleader with being safe and conservative and wise, that leader is not\r\nserving you. And if you take exception to that statement, just ask me to\r\nprove it.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe rank and file of all unions, barring their ignorance, are all right.\r\nThe working class as a whole is all right. Many of them are misguided,\r\nand stand in the light of their own interest.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes necessary that we offend you and even shock you, that\r\nyou may understand that we are your friends and not your enemies. And if\r\nwe are against your unions it is because we are for you. We know that\r\nyou have paid your dues into them for years and that you are animated by\r\na spirit of misdirected loyalty to those unions.\r\n\r\nI can remember that it was not a very easy matter for me to give up the\r\nunion in which I had spent my boyhood and all the years of my young\r\nmanhood. I remember that I felt there was something in it in the nature\r\nof a sacrifice, and yet I had to make it in the interest of the larger\r\nduty that I owed myself and the working class.\r\n\r\nLet me say to you, if you are a craft unionist, that infinitely greater\r\nthan your loyalty to your craft is your loyalty to the working class as\r\na whole. No craft union can fight this great battle successfully alone.\r\nThe craft is a part, a part only, of the great body of the working\r\nclass. And the time has come for this class, numerically overwhelmingly\r\nin the majority, to follow in one respect at least the example of its\r\ncapitalist masters and unite as a whole.\r\n\r\nIn this barbarous competitive struggle in which we are engaged, the\r\nworkers, the millions, are fighting each other to sell themselves into\r\nslavery; the middle class are fighting each other to get enough trade to\r\nkeep soul and body together, and the professional class are fighting\r\neach other like savages for practice. And this is called civilization!\r\nWhat a mockery! What a sham! There is no real civilization in the\r\ncapitalist system.\r\n\r\nToday there is nothing so easily produced as wealth. The whole earth\r\nconsists of raw materials; and in every breath of nature, in sunshine,\r\nand in shower, hidden everywhere, are the subtle forces that may, by the\r\ntouch of the hand of labor, be set into operation to transmute these raw\r\nmaterials into wealth, the finished products, in all their multiplied\r\nforms and in opulent abundance for all. The merest child can press a\r\nbutton that will set in operation a forest of machinery and produce\r\nwealth enough for a community.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be said of the ignorant, barbarous past, there is no excuse\r\nfor poverty today. And yet it is the scourge of the race. It is the\r\nNemesis of capitalist civilization. Ten millions, one-eighth of our\r\nwhole population, are in a state of chronic poverty. Three millions of\r\nthese have been sunk to unresisting pauperism. The whole working class\r\nis in a sadly dependent state, and even the most favored wage-worker is\r\nleft suspended by a single thread. He does not know what hour a machine\r\nmay be invented to make his trade useless, displace him and throw him\r\ninto the increasing army of the unemployed.\r\n\r\nAnd how does labor live today? Here in Chicago you may walk along a\r\ncertain boulevard, say 18th street, and you will find it lined with\r\nmagnificent palaces. Beyond that you will find a larger district where\r\nthe still complacent middle class abide. Beyond that is a very much\r\nlarger territory where the working class exist; and still beyond that,\r\nto complete the circle, you see the red lights flickering in the\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nProstitution is a part, a necessary part, of capitalist society. The\r\ndepartment store empties in the slums.\r\n\r\nI have been here enough to know that when the daughter of a workingman\r\nis obliged to go up the street to look for employment, when she is\r\nfourteen or fifteen years of age, and ought to be in the care and\r\nkeeping of a loving mother, and have all of the advantages that our\r\ncivilization makes possible for all—when she is forced to go to a\r\ndepartment store, to one of those capitalist emporiums, and there find a\r\nplace, if she can, and work for a wage of $3 a week, and have to obey a\r\ncode of cast-iron regulations, appear tidy and neatly dressed and be\r\nsubject to a thousand temptations daily, and then takes a misstep, the\r\nfirst, as she is more than apt to do, especially if she has no home in\r\nany decent sense of that term—the very instant this is added to her\r\npoverty, she is doomed—damned. All the doors of capitalist society are\r\nclosed in her face. The coals of contumely are poured upon her head.\r\nThere is for her no redemption, and she takes the next step, and the\r\nnext, until at last she ends a disgraceful career in a brothel hell.\r\n\r\nThis may be your child. And if you are a workingman, and this should\r\nfall to the lot of the innocent blue-eyed child that you love more than\r\nyou do your own life—I want you to realize that if such a horror be\r\nwritten in the book of fate, that you are responsible for it, if you use\r\nor misuse your power to perpetuate the capitalist system and working\r\nclass slavery.\r\n\r\nYou can change this condition—not tomorrow, not next week, nor next\r\nyear; but in the meantime the next thing to changing it is making up\r\nyour mind that it shall be changed. That is what we Industrial Unionists\r\nhave done. And so there has come to us a new state of mind, and in our\r\nhearts there is the joy of service and the serenity of triumph.\r\n\r\nWe are united and we cannot be disunited. We cannot be stampeded. We\r\nknow that we are confronted by ten thousand difficulties. We know that\r\nall the powers of capitalism are to be arrayed against us. But were\r\nthese obstacles multiplied by a million, it would simply have the effect\r\nof multiplying our determination by a million, to overcome them all. And\r\nso we are organizing and appealing to you.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe workingman today does not understand his industrial relation to his\r\nfellow-workers. He has never been correlated with others in the same\r\nindustry. He has mechanically done his part. He has simply been a cog,\r\nwith little reference to, or knowledge of, the rest of the cogs. Now, we\r\nteach him to hold up his head and look over the whole mechanism. If he\r\nis employed in a certain plant, as an Industrial Unionist, his eyes are\r\nopened. He takes a survey of the entire productive mechanism, and he\r\nunderstands his part in it, and his relation to every other worker in\r\nthat industry. The very instant he does that he is buoyed by a fresh\r\nhope and thrilled with a new aspiration. He becomes a larger man. He\r\nbegins to feel like a collective son of toil.\r\n\r\nThen he and his fellows study to fit themselves to take control of this\r\nproductive mechanism when it shall be transferred from the idle\r\ncapitalist to the workers to whom it rightfully belongs.\r\n\r\nIn every mill and every factory, every mine and every quarry, every\r\nrailroad and every shop, everywhere, the workers, enlightened,\r\nunderstanding their self-interest, are correlating themselves in the\r\nindustrial and economic mechanism. They are developing their industrial\r\nconsciousness, their economic and political power; and when the\r\nrevolution comes, they will be prepared to take possession and assume\r\ncontrol of every industry. With the education they will have received in\r\nthe Industrial Workers they will be drilled and disciplined, trained and\r\nfitted for Industrial Mastery and Social Freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Industrial Unionism\r\n\r\n     _Address at Grand Central Palace, New York, December 10, 1905_\r\n\r\nThere is an inspiration in your greeting and my heart opens wide to\r\nreceive it. I have come a thousand miles to join with you in fanning the\r\nflames of the proletarian revolution. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nYour presence here makes this a vitalizing atmosphere for a labor\r\nagitator. I can feel my stature increasing, and this means that you are\r\ngrowing, for all my strength is drawn from you, and without you I am\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nIn capitalist society you are the lower class; the capitalists are the\r\nupper class—because they are on your backs; if they were not on your\r\nbacks, they could not be above you. (Applause and laughter.)\r\n\r\nStanding in your presence, I can see in your gleaming eyes and in your\r\nglowing faces the vanguard; I can hear the tramp, I can feel the thrill\r\nof the social revolution. The working class are waking up. (A voice,\r\n“You bet.”) They are beginning to understand that their economic\r\ninterests are identical, that they must unite and act together\r\neconomically and politically, and in every other way; that only by\r\nunited action can they overthrow the capitalist system and emancipate\r\nthemselves from wage-slavery. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nI have said that in the capitalist society the working class are the\r\nlower class; they have always been the lower class. In the ancient world\r\nfor thousands of years they were abject slaves; in the Middle Ages,\r\nserfs; in modern times, wageworkers; to become free men in socialism,\r\nthe next inevitable phase of advancing civilization. (Applause.) The\r\nworking class have struggled through all the various phases of their\r\ndevelopment, and they are today engaged in the last stage of the animal\r\nstruggle for existence; and when the present revolution has run its\r\ncourse, the working class will stand forth the sovereigns of this earth.\r\n\r\nIn capitalist society the working man is not, in fact, a man at all; as\r\na wage-worker, he is simply merchandise; he is bought in the open market\r\nthe same as hair, hides, salt, or any other form of merchandise. The\r\nvery terminology of the capitalist system proves that he is not a man in\r\nany sense of that term.\r\n\r\nWhen the capitalist needs you as a workingman to operate his machine, he\r\ndoes not advertise, he does not call for men, but for “hands”; and when\r\nyou see a placard posted, “Fifty hands wanted,” you stop on the instant;\r\nyou know that that means YOU, and you take a bee-line for the bureau of\r\nemployment to offer yourself in evidence of the fact that you are a\r\n“hand.” When the capitalist advertises for hands, that is what he wants.\r\n\r\nHe would be insulted if you were to call him a “hand.” He has his\r\ncapitalist politician tell you, when your vote is wanted, that you ought\r\nto be very proud of your hands because they are horny; and if that is\r\ntrue, he ought to be ashamed of his. (Laughter and applause.)\r\n\r\nWhat is your status in society today? You are a human being, a\r\nwage-worker. Here you stand just as you were created, and you have two\r\nhands that represent your labor power; but you do not work, and why not?\r\nFor the simple reason that you have no tools with which to work; you\r\ncannot compete against the machinery of the capitalist with your bare\r\nhands; you cannot work unless you have access to it, and you can only\r\nsecure access to it by selling your labor power, that is to say, your\r\nenergy, your vitality, your life itself, to the capitalist who owns the\r\ntool with which you work, and without which you are idle and suffer all\r\nof the ills that idleness entails.\r\n\r\nIn the evolution of capitalism, society has been divided mainly into two\r\neconomic classes; a relatively small class of capitalists who own tools\r\nin the form of great machines they did not make and cannot use, and a\r\ngreat body of many millions of workers who did make these tools and who\r\ndo use them, and whose very lives depend upon them, yet who do not own\r\nthem; and these millions of wage-workers, producers of wealth, are\r\nforced into the labor market, in competition with each other, disposing\r\nof their labor power to the capitalist class, in consideration of just\r\nenough of what they produce to keep them in working order. They are\r\nexploited of the greater share of what their labor produces, so that\r\nwhile, upon the one hand, they can produce in great abundance, upon the\r\nother they can consume but that share of the product that their meagre\r\nwage will buy; and every now and then it follows that they have produced\r\nmore than can be consumed in the present system, and then they are\r\ndisplaced by the very products of their own labor; the mills and shops\r\nand mines and quarries in which they are employed close down, the tools\r\nare locked up and they are locked out, and they find themselves idle and\r\nhelpless in the shadow of the very abundance their labor has created.\r\n\r\nThere is no hope for them in this system. They are beginning to realize\r\nthis fact, and so they are beginning to organize; they are no longer\r\nrelying upon someone, else, but they are making up their minds to depend\r\nupon themselves and to organize for their own emancipation.\r\n\r\nToo long have the workers of the world waited for some Moses to lead\r\nthem out of bondage. He has not come; he never will come. I would not\r\nlead you out if I could; for if you could be led out, you could be led\r\nback again. (Applause.) I would have you make up your minds that there\r\nis nothing that you cannot do for yourselves.\r\n\r\nYou do not need the capitalist. He could not exist an instant without\r\nyou. You would just begin to live without him. (Laughter and prolonged\r\napplause.) You do everything and he has everything; and some of you\r\nimagine that if it were not for him you would have no work. As a matter\r\nof fact, he does not employ you at all; you employ him to take from you\r\nwhat you produce, and he faithfully sticks to his task. If you can stand\r\nit, he can; and if you don’t change this relation, I am sure he won’t.\r\nYou make the automobile, he rides in it. If it were not for you, he\r\nwould walk; and if it were not for him, you would ride.\r\n\r\nThe capitalist politician tells you on occasion that you are the salt of\r\nthe earth; and if you are, you had better begin to salt down the\r\ncapitalist class.\r\n\r\nThe revolutionary movement of the working class will date from the year\r\n1905, from the organization of the INDUSTRIAL WORKERS OF THE WORLD.\r\n(Prolonged applause.) Economic solidarity is today the supreme need of\r\nthe working class. The old form of unionism has long since fulfilled its\r\nmission and outlived its usefulness, and the hour has struck for a\r\nchange.\r\n\r\nThe old unionism is organized upon the basis of the identity of\r\ninterests of the capitalist and working classes. It spends its time and\r\nenergy trying to conciliate these two essentially antagonistic classes;\r\nand so this unionism has at its head a harmonizing board called the\r\nCivic Federation. This federation consists of three parts; a part\r\nrepresenting the capitalist class; a part supposed to represent the\r\nworking class, and still another part that is said to represent the\r\n“public.” The capitalists are represented by that great union labor\r\nchampion, August Belmont. (Laughter and hisses.) The working class by\r\nSamuel Gompers, the president of the American Federation of Labor\r\n(hisses and cries, “sic him”), and the public, by Grover Cleveland.\r\n(Laughter.)\r\n\r\nCan you imagine a fox and goose peace congress? Just fancy such a\r\nmeeting, the goose lifting its wings in benediction, and the fox\r\nwhispering, “Let us prey.”\r\n\r\nThe Civic Federation has been organized for the one purpose of\r\nprolonging the age-long sleep of the working class. Their supreme\r\npurpose is to keep you from waking up. (A voice: “They can’t do it.”)\r\n\r\nThe Industrial Workers has been organized for an opposite purpose, and\r\nits representatives come in your presence to tell you that there can be\r\nno peace between you, the working class, and the capitalist class who\r\nexploit you of what you produce; that as workers you have economic\r\ninterests apart from and opposed to their interests, and that you must\r\norganize by and for yourselves; and that if you are intelligent enough\r\nto understand these interests you will sever your relations with the old\r\nunions in which you are divided and sub-divided, and join the Industrial\r\nWorkers, in which all are organized and united upon the basis of the\r\nclass struggle. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nThe Industrial Workers is organized, not to conciliate, but to fight the\r\ncapitalist class. We have no object in concealing any part of our\r\nmission; we would have it perfectly understood. We deny that there is\r\nanything in common between workingmen and capitalists. We insist that\r\nworkingmen must organize to get rid of capitalists and make themselves\r\nthe masters of the tools with which they work, freely employ themselves,\r\nsecure to themselves all they produce, and enjoy to the full the fruit\r\nof their labors. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nThe old union movement is not only organized upon the basis of the\r\nidentity of interests of the exploited and exploiting classes, but it\r\ndivides instead of uniting the workers, and there are thousands of\r\nunions, more or less in conflict, used against one another; and so long\r\nas these countless unions occupy the field, there will be no substantial\r\nunity of the working class. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nAnd here let me say that the most zealous supporter of the old union is\r\nthe capitalist himself. August Belmont, president of the Civic\r\nFederation, takes special pride in declaring himself a “union man”\r\n(laughter); but he does not mean by that that he is an Industrial\r\nWorker; that is not the kind of a union he means. He means the impotent\r\nold union that Mr. Gompers and Mr. Mitchell lead, the kind that keeps\r\nthe working class divided so that the capitalist system may be\r\nperpetuated indefinitely.\r\n\r\nFor thirty years I have been connected with the organized labor\r\nmovement. I have long since been made to realize that the pure and\r\nsimple union can do nothing for the working class; I have had some\r\nexperience and know whereof I speak. The craft union seeks to establish\r\nits own petty supremacy. Craft division is fatal to class unity. To\r\norganize along craft lines means to divide the working class and make it\r\nthe prey of the capitalist class. The working class can only be\r\nunionized efficiently along class lines; and so the Industrial Workers\r\nhas been organized, not to isolate the crafts but to unite the whole\r\nworking class. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nThe working class has had considerable experience during the past few\r\nyears. In almost every conflict between labor and capital, labor has\r\nbeen defeated. Take the leading strikes in their order, and you will\r\nfind that, without a single exception, the organized workers have been\r\ndefeated, and thousands upon thousands of them have lost their jobs, and\r\nmany of them have become “scabs.” Is there not something wrong with a\r\nunionism in which the workers are always worsted? Let me review\r\nhurriedly some of this history of the past few years.\r\n\r\nI have seen the conductors on the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad,\r\norganized in a craft union, take the place of the striking union\r\nlocomotive engineers on the same system.\r\n\r\nI have seen the employes of the Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railway,\r\norganized in their several craft unions, stand by the corporation as a\r\nunit, totally wiping out the union telegraphers, thirteen hundred of\r\nthem losing their jobs.\r\n\r\nI have seen these same craft unions, just a little while ago, on the\r\nNorthern Pacific and Great Northern systems—I have seen them unite with\r\nthe corporation to crush out the telegraphers’ union, and defeat the\r\nstrikers, their own co-unionists and fellow employes.\r\n\r\nJust a few weeks ago, in the city of Chicago, the switchmen on the Grand\r\nTrunk went out on strike. All their fellow unionists remained at work\r\nand faithfully served the corporation until the switchmen were defeated,\r\nand now those union switchmen are scattered about looking for jobs.\r\n\r\nThe machinists were recently on strike in Chicago. They went out in a\r\nbody under the direction of their craft union. Their fellow unionists\r\nall remained at work until the machinists were completely defeated, and\r\nnow their organization in that city is on the verge of collapse.\r\n\r\nThere has been a ceaseless repetition of this form of scabbing of one\r\ncraft union upon another until the working man, if his eyes are open, is\r\nbound to see that this kind of unionism is a curse and not a benefit to\r\nthe working class.\r\n\r\nThe American Federation of Labor does not learn by experience. They\r\nrecently held their annual convention, and they passed the same old\r\nstereotyped resolutions; they are going to petition Congress to restrict\r\nthe power of the courts; that is to say, they are going to once more\r\npetition a capitalist Congress to restrict the power of capitalist\r\ncourts. That is as if a flock of sheep were to petition a pack of wolves\r\nto extract their own fangs. They have passed these resolutions over and\r\nover again. They have been totally fruitless and will continue to be.\r\n\r\nWhat good came to the working class from this convention? Put your\r\nfinger upon a single thing they did that will be of any real benefit to\r\nthe workers of the country!\r\n\r\nYou have had some experience here in New York. You have plenty of\r\nunionism here, such as it is, yet there is not a city in the country in\r\nwhich the workers are less organized than they are here. It was in March\r\nlast that you had here an exhibition of pure and simple unionism. You\r\nsaw about six thousand craft union men go out on strike, and you saw\r\ntheir fellow unionists remain at work loyally until all the strikers\r\nwere defeated and sacrificed. Here you have an object lesson that is\r\nwell calculated to set you thinking, and this is all I can hope to do by\r\ncoming here, set you thinking, and for yourselves; for when you begin to\r\nthink, you will soon begin to act for yourselves. You will then sever\r\nyour relations with capitalist unions and capitalist parties (applause),\r\nand you will begin the real work of organizing your class, and that is\r\nwhat we of the Industrial Workers have engaged to do. We have a new\r\nmission. That mission is not merely the amelioration of the condition of\r\nthe working class, but the complete emancipation of that class from\r\nslavery. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nThe Industrial Workers is going to do all for the working class that can\r\nbe done in the capitalist system, but while it is engaged in doing that,\r\nits revolutionary eye will be fixed upon the goal; and there will be a\r\ngreat difference between a strike of revolutionary workers and a strike\r\nof ignorant trade unionists who but vaguely understand what they want\r\nand do not know how to get that. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nThe Industrial Workers is less than six months old, and already has a\r\nround hundred thousand of dues-paying members. (Applause.) This splendid\r\nachievement has no parallel in the annals of organized labor. From every\r\ndirection come the applications for charters and for organizers, and\r\nwhen the delegates of this revolutionary economic organization meet in\r\nthe city of Chicago, next year, it will be the greatest convention that\r\never met in the United States in the interest of the working class.\r\n(Applause.)\r\n\r\nThis organization has a world-wide mission; it makes its appeal directly\r\nto the working class. It asks no favors from capitalists.\r\n\r\nNo organization of working men has ever been so flagrantly\r\nmisrepresented by the capitalist press as has been the Industrial\r\nWorkers of the World; every delegate to the Chicago convention will bear\r\ntestimony to this fact; and this is as it should be; the capitalist\r\npress is the mouthpiece of the capitalist class, and the very fact that\r\nthe capitalist press is the organ, virtually, of the American Federation\r\nof Labor, is in itself sufficient to open the eyes of the working class.\r\n\r\nIf the American Federation of Labor were not in alliance with the\r\ncapitalist class, the capitalist press would not pour its fulsome eulogy\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\nThis press has not one friendly word for the Industrial Workers, not\r\none, and we do not expect it to have. These papers of the plutocrats\r\nknow us and we know them (applause); between us there is no\r\nmisunderstanding.\r\n\r\nThe workers of the country (the intelligent ones at least) readily see\r\nthe difference between revolutionary and reactionary unionism, and that\r\nis why they are deserting the old and joining the new; that is why the\r\nIndustrial Workers is building up so rapidly; that is why there is such\r\na widespread demand for organizers and for literature and for all other\r\nmeans of building up this class-conscious economic organization.\r\n(Applause.)\r\n\r\nAs I have said, the Industrial Workers begin by declaring that there is\r\nnothing in common between capitalists and wage-workers.\r\n\r\nThe capitalists own the tools they do not use, and the workers use the\r\ntools they do not own.\r\n\r\nThe capitalists, who own the tools that the working class use\r\nappropriate to themselves what the working class produce, and this\r\naccounts for the fact that a few capitalists become fabulously rich\r\nwhile the toiling millions remain in poverty, ignorance and dependence.\r\n\r\nLet me make this point perfectly clear for the benefit of those who have\r\nnot thought it out for themselves. Andrew Carnegie is a type of the\r\ncapitalist class. He owns the tools with which steel is produced. These\r\ntools are used by many thousands of working men. Andrew Carnegie, who\r\nowns these tools, has absolutely nothing to do with the production of\r\nsteel. He may be in Scotland, or where he will, the production of steel\r\ngoes forward just the same. His mills at Pittsburg, Duquesne and\r\nHomestead, where these tools are located, are thronged with thousands of\r\ntoolless wage-workers, who work day and night, in winter’s cold and\r\nsummer’s heat, who endure all the privations and make all the sacrifices\r\nof health and limb and life, producing thousands upon thousands of tons\r\nof steel, yet not having an interest, even the slightest, in the\r\nproduct. Carnegie, who owns the tools, appropriates the product, and the\r\nworkers, in exchange for their labor power, receive a wage that serves\r\nto keep them in producing order; and the more industrious they are, and\r\nthe more they produce, the worse they are off; for the sooner they have\r\nproduced more than Carnegie can get rid of in the markets, the tool\r\nhouses are shut down and the workers are locked out in the cold.\r\n\r\nThis is a beautiful arrangement—for Mr. Carnegie; he does not want a\r\nchange, and so he is in favor of the Civic Federation, and a leading\r\nmember of it; and he is doing what he can to induce you to think that\r\nthis ideal relation ought to be maintained forever.\r\n\r\nNow, what is true of steel production is true of every other department\r\nof industrial activity; you belong to the millions who have no tools,\r\nwho cannot work without selling your labor power, and when you sell\r\nthat, you have got to deliver it in person; you cannot send it to the\r\nmill, you have got to carry it there; you are inseparable from your\r\nlabor power.\r\n\r\nYou have got to go to the mill at 7 in the morning and work until 6 in\r\nthe evening, producing, not for yourself, but for the capitalist who\r\nowns the tools you made and use, and without which you are almost as\r\nhelpless as if you had no arms.\r\n\r\nThis fundamental fact in modern industry you must recognize, and you\r\nmust organize upon the basis of this fact; you must appeal to your class\r\nto join the union that is the true expression of your economic\r\ninterests, and this union must be large enough to embrace you all, and\r\nsuch is the Industrial Workers of the World.\r\n\r\nEvery man and every woman who works for wages is eligible to membership.\r\n\r\nOrganized into various departments, when you join you become a member of\r\nthe department that represents your craft, or occupation, whatever it\r\nmay be; and when you have a grievance, your department has supervision\r\nof it; and if you fail to adjust it in that department, you are not\r\nlimited to your craft alone for support, but, if necessary, all the\r\nworkers in all other departments will unite solidly in your defense to\r\nthe very last. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nTake a plant in modern industry. The workers, under the old form of\r\nunionism, are parceled out to a score or more of unions. Craft division\r\nincites craft jealousy and so they are more or less in conflict with\r\neach other, and the employer constructively takes advantage of this\r\nfact, and that is why he favors pure and simple unionism.\r\n\r\nIt were better for the workers who wear craft fetters if they were not\r\norganized at all, for then they could and would spontaneously go out on\r\nstrike together; but they cannot do this in craft unionism, for certain\r\ncrafts bind themselves up in craft agreements, and after they have done\r\nthis, they are at the mercy of the capitalist; and when their fellow\r\nunionists call upon them for aid, they make the very convenient excuse\r\nthat they cannot help them, that they must preserve the sanctity of the\r\ncontract they have made with the employer. This so-called contract is\r\nregarded as of vastly more importance than the jobs, aye, the very lives\r\nof the workingmen themselves.\r\n\r\nWe do not intend that certain departments shall so attach themselves to\r\nthe capitalist employers. We purpose that the workers shall all be\r\norganized, and if there is any agreement, it will embrace them all; and\r\nif there is any violation of the agreement, in the case of a single\r\nemploye, it at once becomes the concern of all. (Applause.) That is\r\nunionism, industrial unionism, in which all of the workers, totally\r\nregardless of occupation, are united compactly within the one\r\norganization, so that at all times they can act together in the\r\ninterests of all. It is upon this basis that the Industrial Workers of\r\nthe World is organized. It is in this spirit and with this object in\r\nview that it makes its appeal to the working class.\r\n\r\nThen, again, the revolutionary economic organization has a new and\r\nimportant function which has never once been thought of in the old\r\nunion, for the simple reason that the old union intends that the wage\r\nsystem shall endure forever.\r\n\r\nThe Industrial Workers declares that the workers must make themselves\r\nthe masters of the tools with which they work; and so a very important\r\nfunction of this new union is to teach the workers, or, rather, have\r\nthem teach themselves the necessity of fitting themselves to take charge\r\nof the industries in which they are employed when they are wrested, as\r\nthey will be, from their capitalist masters. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nSo when you join the Industrial Workers you feel the thrill of a new\r\naspiration; you are no longer a blind, dumb wageslave. You begin to\r\nunderstand your true and vital relation to your fellow-workers. In the\r\nIndustrial Workers you are correlated to all other workers in the plant,\r\nand thus you develop the embryonic structure of the co-operative\r\ncommonwealth. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nThe old unionism would have you contented. We Industrial Workers are\r\ndoing what we can to increase your discontent. We would have you rise in\r\nrevolt against wage-slavery. The working man who is contented today is\r\ntruly a pitiable object. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nVictor Hugo once said: “Think of a smile in chains,”—that is a working\r\nman who, under the influence of the Civic Federation, is satisfied with\r\nhis lot; he is glad he has a master, some one to serve; for, in his\r\nignorance, he imagines that he is dependent upon the master.\r\n\r\nThe Industrial Workers is appealing to the working class to develop\r\ntheir latent powers and above all, their capacity for clear thinking.\r\n\r\nYou are a working man and you have a brain and if you do not use it in\r\nyour own interests, you are guilty of treason to your manhood.\r\n(Applause.)\r\n\r\nIt is for the very reason that you do not use your brain in your\r\ninterests that you are compelled to deform your body in the interests of\r\nyour master.\r\n\r\nI have already said that the capitalist is on your back; he furnishes\r\nthe mouth, you the hands; he consumes, you produce. That is why he runs\r\nlargely to stomach and you to hands. (Laughter.)\r\n\r\nI would not be a capitalist; I would be a man; you cannot be both at the\r\nsame time. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nThe capitalist exists by exploitation, lives out of the labor, that is\r\nto say the life, of the working man; consumes him, and his code of\r\nmorals and standard of ethics justify it and this proves that capitalism\r\nis cannibalism. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nA man, honest, just, high-minded, would scorn to live out of the sweat\r\nand sorrow of his fellow man—by preying upon his weaker brother.\r\n\r\nWe purpose to destroy the capitalist and save the man. (Applause.) We\r\nwant a system in which the worker shall get what he produces and the\r\ncapitalist shall produce what he gets. (Applause.) That is a square\r\ndeal.\r\n\r\nThe prevailing lack of unity implies the lack of class consciousness.\r\nThe workers do not yet understand that they are engaged in a class\r\nstruggle, that they must unite their class and get on the right side of\r\nthat struggle economically, politically and in every other\r\nway—(applause), strike together, vote together and, if necessary, fight\r\ntogether. (Prolonged applause.)\r\n\r\nThe capitalist and the leader of the pure and simple union do what they\r\ncan to wipe out the class lines; they do not want you to recognize the\r\n_class_ struggle; they contrive to keep you divided, and as long as you\r\nare divided, you will remain where you are, robbed and helpless.\r\n\r\nWhen you unite and act together, the world is yours. (Prolonged\r\napplause.)\r\n\r\nThe fabled Samson, shorn of his locks, the secret of his power, was the\r\nsport and prey of the pygmies that tormented him. The modern working\r\nclass, shorn of their tools, the secret of their power, are at the mercy\r\nof a small class who exploit them of what they produce and then hold\r\nthem in contempt because of their slavery.\r\n\r\nNo master ever had the slightest respect for his slave, and no slave\r\never had the least real love for his master.\r\n\r\nBetween these two classes there is an irrepressible conflict, and we\r\nIndustrial Workers are pointing it out that you may see it, that you may\r\nget on the right side of it, that you may get together and emancipate\r\nyourselves from every form of servitude.\r\n\r\nIt can be done in no other way; but a bit of sober reasoning will\r\nconvince you workers of this fact.\r\n\r\nIt is so simple that a child can see it. Why can’t you? You can if you\r\nwill think for yourselves and see for yourselves. But you will not do\r\nthis if you were taught in the old union school; you will still look to\r\nsomeone else to lead that you may follow; for you are trained to follow\r\nthe blind leaders of the blind. You have been betrayed over and over\r\nagain, and there will be no change until you make up your minds to think\r\nand see and act for yourselves.\r\n\r\nI would not have you blindly walk into the Industrial Workers; if I had\r\nsufficient influence or power to draw you into it, I would not do it. I\r\nwould have you stay where you are until you can see your way clear to\r\njoin it of your own accord. It is your organization; it is composed of\r\nyour class; it is committed to the interests of your class; it is going\r\nto fight for your class, for your whole class, and continue the fight\r\nuntil your class is emancipated. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nThere is a great deal of opposition to this organization. The whole\r\ncapitalist class and all their labor lieutenants are against it\r\n(applause); and there is an army of them, and all their names are on the\r\npay-roll and expense account. They all hold salaried positions, and are\r\nlooking out for themselves.\r\n\r\nWhen the working class unite, there will be a lot of jobless labor\r\nleaders. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nIn many of these craft unions they have it so arranged that the rank and\r\nfile do not count for any more than if they were so many sheep. In the\r\nrailroad organizations, for instance, if the whole membership vote to go\r\nout on strike, they cannot budge without the official sanction of the\r\n“Grand Chief.” His word outweighs that of the entire membership. In the\r\nlight of this extraordinary fact, is it strange that the workers are\r\noften betrayed? Is it strange that they continue at the mercy of their\r\nexploiters?\r\n\r\nHaven’t they had quite enough of this? Isn’t it time for them to take an\r\ninventory of their own resources?\r\n\r\nIf you are a working man, suppose you look yourself over, just once;\r\ntake an invoice of your mental stock and see what you have. Do not\r\naccept my word; do not depend upon anybody but yourself. Think it out\r\nfor yourself; and if you do, I am quite certain that you will join the\r\norganization that represents your class (applause); the organization\r\nthat has room for all your class; the organization that appeals to you\r\nto develop your own brain, to rely upon yourself and be a man among men.\r\nAnd that is what the working class have to do, cultivate self-reliance\r\nand think and act for themselves; and that is what they are stimulated\r\nto do in the Industrial Workers.\r\n\r\nWe have great hope and abiding faith for we know that each day will\r\nbring us increasing numbers, influences and power; and this\r\nnotwithstanding all the opposition that can be arrayed against us.\r\n\r\nWe know that the principles of the Industrial Workers are right and that\r\nits ultimate triumph is assured beyond the question of a doubt; and if\r\nyou believe in its conquering mission, then we ask you to be true enough\r\nto yourselves and your class to join it; and when you join it you will\r\nhave a duty to perform and that duty will be to go out among the\r\nunorganized and bring them into the ranks and help in this great work of\r\neducation and organization, without which the working class is doomed to\r\ncontinued ignorance and slavery.\r\n\r\nKarl Marx, the profound economic philosopher, who will be known in\r\nfuture as the great emancipator, uttered the inspiring shibboleth a half\r\ncentury ago: “Workingmen of all countries unite; you have nothing to\r\nlose but your chains; you have a world to gain.”\r\n\r\nYou workers are the only class essential to society; all others can be\r\nspared, but without you society would perish. You produce the wealth,\r\nyou support government, you create and conserve civilization. You ought\r\nto be, can be and will be the masters of the earth. (Great applause.)\r\n\r\nWhy should you be dependent upon a capitalist? Why should this\r\ncapitalist own a tool he cannot use? And why should not you own the tool\r\nyou have to use?\r\n\r\nEvery cog in every wheel that revolves everywhere has been made by the\r\nworking class, and is set and kept in operation by the working class;\r\nand if the working class can make and operate this marvelous\r\nwealth-producing machinery, they can also develop the intelligence to\r\nmake themselves the masters of this machinery (applause), and operate it\r\nnot to turn out millionaires, but to produce wealth in abundance for\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nYou cannot afford to be contented with your lot; you have a brain to\r\ndevelop and a manhood to sustain. You ought to have some aspiration to\r\nbe free.\r\n\r\nSuppose you do have a job, and that you can get enough to eat and\r\nclothes enough to cover your body, and a place to sleep; you but exist\r\nupon the animal plane; your very life is suspended by a slender thread;\r\nyou don’t know what hour a machine may be invented to displace you, or\r\nyou may offend your economic master, and your job is gone. You go to\r\nwork early in the morning and you work all day; you go to your lodging\r\nat night, tired; you throw your exhausted body upon a bed of straw to\r\nrecuperate enough to go back to the factory and repeat the same dull\r\noperation the next day, and the next, and so on and on to the dreary\r\nend; and in some respects you are not so well off as was the chattel\r\nslave.\r\n\r\nHe had no fear of losing his job; he was not blacklisted; he had food\r\nand clothing and shelter; and now and then, seized with a desire for\r\nfreedom, he tried to run away from his master. You do not try to run\r\naway from yours. He doesn’t have to hire a policeman to keep an eye on\r\nyou. When you run, it is in the opposite direction, when the bell rings\r\nor the whistle blows.\r\n\r\nYou are as much subject to the command of the capitalist as if you were\r\nhis property under the law. You have got to go to his factory because\r\nyou have got to work; he is the master of your job, and you cannot work\r\nwithout his consent, and he only gives this on condition that you\r\nsurrender to him all you produce except what is necessary to keep you in\r\nrunning order.\r\n\r\nThe machine you work with has to be oiled; you have to be fed; the wage\r\nis your lubricant, it keeps you in working order, and so you toil and\r\nsweat and groan and reproduce yourself in the form of labor power, and\r\nthen you pass away like a silk worm that spins its task and dies.\r\n\r\nThat is your lot in the capitalist system and you have no right to\r\naspire to rise above the dead level of wage-slavery.\r\n\r\nIt is true that one in ten thousand may escape from his class and become\r\na millionaire; he is the rare exception that proves the rule. The\r\nwage-workers remain in the working class, and they never can become\r\nanything else in the capitalist system. They produce and perish, and\r\ntheir exploited bones mingle with the dust.\r\n\r\nEvery few years there is a panic, industrial paralysis, and hundreds of\r\nthousands of workers are flung into the streets; no work, no wages; and\r\nso they throng the highways in search of employment that cannot be\r\nfound; they become vagrants, tramps, outcasts, criminals. It is in this\r\nway that the human being degenerates, and that crime graduates in the\r\ncapitalist system, all the way from petty larceny to homicide.\r\n\r\nThe working millions who produce the wealth have little or nothing to\r\nshow for it. There is widespread ignorance among them; industrial and\r\nsocial conditions prevail that defy all language properly to describe.\r\nThe working class consist of a mass of human beings, men, women and\r\nchildren, in enforced competition with one another, in all of the\r\ncircling hours of the day and night, for the sale of their labor power,\r\nand in the severity of the competition the wage sinks gradually until it\r\ntouches the point of subsistence.\r\n\r\nIn this struggle more than five millions of women are engaged and about\r\ntwo millions of children, and the number of child laborers is steadily\r\nincreasing, for in this system profit is important, while life has no\r\nvalue. It is not a question of male labor, or female labor, or child\r\nlabor; it is simply a question of cheap labor without reference to the\r\neffect upon the working class; the woman is employed in preference to\r\nthe man and the child in preference to the woman; and so we have\r\nmillions of children, who, in their early, tender years, are seized in\r\nthe iron clutch of capitalism, when they ought to be upon the\r\nplayground, or at school; when they ought to be in the sunlight, when\r\nthey ought to have wholesome food and enjoy the fresh atmosphere they\r\nare forced into the industrial dungeons and there they are riveted to\r\nthe machines; they feed the insatiate monsters and become as living cogs\r\nin the revolving wheels. They are literally fed to industry to produce\r\nprofits. They are dwarfed and deformed, mentally, morally and\r\nphysically; they have no chance in life; they are the victims of the\r\nindustrial system that the Industrial Workers is organized to abolish in\r\nthe interest, not only of the working class, but in the higher interest\r\nof all humanity. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nIf there is a crime that should bring to the callous cheek of capitalist\r\nsociety the crimson of shame, it is the unspeakable crime of child\r\nslavery; the millions of babes that fester in the sweat shops, are the\r\nslaves of the wheel, and cry out in their agony, but are not heard in\r\nthe din and roar of our industrial infernalism.\r\n\r\nTake that great army of workers, called coal miners, organized in a\r\ncraft union that does nothing for them; that seeks to make them\r\ncontented with their lot. These miners are at the very foundation of\r\nindustry and without their labor every wheel would cease to revolve as\r\nif by the decree of some industrial Jehovah. (Applause.) There are\r\n600,000 of these slaves whose labor makes possible the firesides of the\r\nworld, while their own loved ones shiver in the cold. I know something\r\nof the conditions under which they toil and despair and perish. I have\r\ntaken time enough to descend to the depths of these pits, that Dante\r\nnever saw, or he might have improved upon his masterpiece. I have stood\r\nover these slaves and I have heard the echo of their picks, which\r\nsounded to me like muffled drums throbbing funeral marches to the grave,\r\nand I have said to myself, in the capitalist system, these wretches are\r\nsimply following their own hearses to the potter’s field.\r\n\r\nIn all of the horizon of the future there is no star that sheds a ray of\r\nhope for them.\r\n\r\nThen I have followed them from the depth of these black holes, over to\r\nthe edge of the camp, not to the home, they have no home; but to a hut\r\nthat is owned by the corporation that owns them, and here I have seen\r\nthe wife,—Victor Hugo once said that the wife of a slave is not a wife\r\nat all; she is simply a female that gives birth to young—I have seen\r\nthis wife standing in the doorway, after trying all day long to make a\r\nten-cent piece do the service of a half-dollar, and she was ill-humored;\r\nthis could not be otherwise, for love and abject poverty do not dwell\r\nbeneath the same roof. Here there is no paper upon the wall and no\r\ncarpet upon the floor; there is not a picture to appeal to the eye;\r\nthere is no statue to challenge the soul, no strain of inspiring music\r\nto touch and quicken what Lincoln called the better angels of human\r\nnature. Here there is haggard poverty and want. And in this atmosphere\r\nthe children of the future are being reared, many thousands of them,\r\nunder conditions that make it morally certain that they will become\r\npaupers, or criminals, or both.\r\n\r\nMan is the product, the expression of his environment. Show me a\r\nmajestic tree that towers aloft, that challenges the admiration of man,\r\nor a beautiful rose-bud that, under the influence of sunshine and\r\nshower, bursts into bloom and fills the common air with its fragrance;\r\nthese are possible only because the soil and climate are adapted to the\r\ngrowth and culture. Transfer this flower from the sunlight and the\r\natmosphere to a cellar filled with noxious gases, and it withers and\r\ndies. The same law applies to human beings; the industrial soil and the\r\nsocial climate must be adapted to the development of men and women, and\r\nthen society will cease producing (cry of “down with capitalism”) the\r\nmultiplied thousands of deformities that today are a rebuke to our much\r\nvaunted civilization, and, above all, an impeachment of the capitalist\r\nsystem. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nWhat is true of the miners is true in a greater or less degree of all\r\nworkers in all other departments of industrial activity. This system has\r\nabout fulfilled its historic mission. Upon every hand there are the\r\nunerring signs of change, and the time has come for the education and\r\norganization of the working class for the social revolution (applause)\r\nthat is to lift the workers from the depths of slavery and elevate them\r\nto an exalted plane of equality and fraternity. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of industrial society men worked with hand tools; a boy\r\ncould learn a trade, make himself the master of the simple tools with\r\nwhich he worked, and employ himself and enjoy what he produced; but that\r\nsimple tool of a century ago has become a mammoth social instrument; in\r\na word, that tool has been socialized. Not only this, but production has\r\nbeen socialized. As small a commodity as a pin or a pen, or a match\r\ninvolves for its production all of the social labor of the land; but\r\nthis evolution is not yet complete; the tool has been socialized,\r\nproduction has been socialized, and now ownership must also be\r\nsocialized; in other words, those great social instruments that are used\r\nin modern industry for the production of wealth, those great social\r\nagencies that are socially made and socially used, must also be socially\r\nowned. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nThe Industrial Workers is the only economic organization that makes this\r\ndeclaration, that states this fact and is organized upon this\r\nfoundation, that the workers must own their tools and employ themselves.\r\nThis involves a revolution, and this means the end of the capitalist\r\nsystem, and the rearing of a working class republic (prolonged\r\napplause), the first real republic the world has ever known; and it is\r\ncoming just as certainly as I stand in your presence.\r\n\r\nYou can hasten it, or you can retard it, but you cannot prevent it.\r\n\r\nThis the working class can achieve, and if you are in that class and you\r\ndo not believe it, it is because of your ignorance; it is because you\r\ngot your education in the school of pure and simple unionism, or in a\r\ncapitalist political party. This the working class can achieve and all\r\nthat is required is that the working class shall be educated, that they\r\nshall unite, that they shall act together.\r\n\r\nThe capitalist politician and the labor lieutenant have always contrived\r\nto keep the working class divided, upon the economic field and upon the\r\npolitical field; and the workers have made no progress, and never will\r\nuntil they desert those false leaders and unite beneath the\r\nrevolutionary standard of the Industrial Workers of the World.\r\n(Applause.)\r\n\r\nThe capitalists have the mills and the tools and the dollars, but you\r\nare an overwhelming majority; you have the men, you have the votes.\r\nThere are not enough of them to continue this system an instant; it can\r\nonly be continued by your consent and with your approval, and to the\r\nextent that you give it you are responsible for your slavery; and if you\r\nhave your eyes opened, if you understand where you properly belong, it\r\nis still a fortunate thing that you cannot do anything for yourself\r\nuntil you have opened the eyes of those that are yet in darkness.\r\n(Applause.)\r\n\r\nNow, there are many workers who have had their eyes opened and they are\r\ngiving their time and energy to the revolutionary education of the\r\nworking class (applause), and every day sees our minority increasing,\r\nand it is but a question of time until this minority will be converted\r\ninto the triumphant majority (applause); and so we wait and watch and\r\nwork in all of the circling hours of the day and night.\r\n\r\nWe have just begun here in New York, and with a vim and an energy\r\nunknown in the circles of unionism. In six months from this night you\r\nwill find that there is a very formidable organization of Industrial\r\nWorkers in New York (applause); and if you are a working man and you\r\nhave convictions of your own, it is your duty to join this union and\r\ntake your place where you belong.\r\n\r\nDon’t hesitate because somebody else is falling back. Don’t wait because\r\nsomebody else is not yet ready. Act and act now and for yourself; and if\r\nyou happen to be the only Industrial Workers in your shop, or in your\r\nimmediate vicinity, you are simply monumental of the ignorance of your\r\nfellow-workers, and you have got to begin to educate them. For a little\r\nwhile they may point you out with the finger of contempt, but you can\r\nstand this; you can bear it with patience; if they persecute you,\r\nbecause you are true to yourself, your latent powers will be developed,\r\nyou will become stronger than you now dream, and then you will do the\r\ndeeds that live, and you will write your name where it will stay.\r\n\r\nNever mind what others may say, or think, or do. Stand erect in the\r\nmajesty of your own manhood.\r\n\r\nListen for just once to the throbbing of your own heart, and you will\r\nhear that it is beating quick-step marches to Camp Freedom.\r\n\r\nStand erect! Lift your bowed form from the earth! The dust has long\r\nenough borne the impress of your knees.\r\n\r\nStand up and see how long a shadow you cast in the sunlight! (Applause).\r\nHold up your head and avow your convictions, and then accept, as becomes\r\na man, the consequences of your acts!\r\n\r\nWe need you and you need us. We have got to have the workers united, and\r\nyou have got to help us in the work. And so we make our appeal to you\r\ntonight, and we know that you will not fail. You can arrive at no other\r\nconclusion; you are bound to join the industrial workers, and become a\r\nmissionary in the field of industrial unionism. You will then feel the\r\necstacy of a new-born aspiration. You will do your very best. You will\r\nwear the badge of the Industrial Workers, and you will wear it with\r\npride and joy.\r\n\r\nThe very contempt that it invites will be a compliment to you; in truth,\r\na tribute to your manhood.\r\n\r\nWe will wrest what we can, step by step, from the capitalists, but with\r\nour eye fixed upon the goal; we will press forward, keeping step\r\ntogether with the inspiring music of the new emancipation; and when we\r\nhave enough of this kind of organization, as Brother De Leon said so\r\nhappily the other day (applause), when we are lined up in battle array,\r\nand the capitalists try to lock us out, we will turn the tables on the\r\ngentlemen and lock them out. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nWe can run the mills without them but they cannot run them without us.\r\n(Applause.)\r\n\r\nIt is a very important thing to develop the economic power, to have a\r\nsound economic organization. This has been the inherent weakness in the\r\nlabor movement of the United States. We need, and sorely need, a\r\nrevolutionary economic organization. We must develop this kind of\r\nstrength; it is the kind that we will have occasion to use in due time,\r\nand it is the kind that will not fail us when the crisis comes. So we\r\nshall organize and continue to organize the political field; and I am of\r\nthose who believe that the day is near at hand when we shall have one\r\ngreat revolutionary economic organization, and one great revolutionary\r\npolitical party of the working class. (Cheers and prolonged applause.)\r\nThen will proceed with increased impetus the work of education and\r\norganization that will culminate in emancipation.\r\n\r\nThis great body will sweep into power and seize the reins of government;\r\ntake possession of industry in the name of the working class, and it can\r\nbe easily done. All that will be required will be to transfer the title\r\ndeeds from the parasites to the producers; and then the working class,\r\nin control of industry, will operate it for the benefit of all. The work\r\nday will be reduced in proportion to the progress of invention. Every\r\nman will work, or at least have a chance to work, and get the full\r\nequivalent of what he produces. He will work, not as a slave, but as a\r\nfree man, and he will express himself in his work and work with joy.\r\nThen the badge of labor will be the only badge of aristocracy. The\r\nindustrial dungeon will become a temple of science. The working class\r\nwill be free, and all humanity disenthralled.\r\n\r\nThe workers are the saviours of society (applause); the redeemers of the\r\nrace; and when they have fulfilled their great historic mission, men and\r\nwomen can walk the highlands and enjoy the vision of a land without\r\nmasters and without slaves, a land regenerated and resplendent in the\r\ntriumph of Freedom and Civilization. (Long, continued applause.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Golden Wedding Anniversary\r\n\r\n _Tribute Paid to Parents, Jean Daniel Debs and Marguerite Bettrich Debs,\r\n   on behalf of the family, at Golden Wedding Anniversary, Terre Haute,\r\n                        Ind., September 13, 1899_\r\n\r\nThe celebration of a Golden wedding is a rare occurrence in the history\r\nof families; only to the favored few is such a blessing vouchsafed. It\r\nis an occasion when nuptial vows pledged at Hymen’s altar take on\r\ninexpressible sacredness. A far distant day is recalled when “two souls\r\nwith but a single thought” and two loving hearts that “beat as one”\r\ncourageously and confidently entered upon the voyage of matrimonial\r\nlife. Thomas Moore, inspired by the genius of love, rapturously sang:\r\n\r\n        “There’s a bliss beyond all that the minstrel has told,\r\n          When two, that are linked in one heavenly tie,\r\n        With heart never changing and brow never cold,\r\n          Live on thro’ all ills, and love on till they die.”\r\n\r\nIt is not given to us, children and grandchildren, who meet today at the\r\nold home shrine to lay our offerings, consecrated by affection, upon the\r\nfamily altar, to know the heart and soul yearnings of our aged parents\r\nto find some favored spot, some oasis in the desert, where they could\r\nbuild a home and enjoy the fruitions of peace and contentment amidst a\r\nfamily of bright-eyed, rosy-cheeked and merry-voiced children.\r\n\r\nIn fancy’s eye we see their beautiful and vine-clad native France; we\r\nsee them in the bloom and strength of youth, standing at the altar and\r\npledging to each other unchanging fidelity in storm and shine, ready to\r\nmeet the future as the day unfolded their duties, their opportunities,\r\ntheir tasks and trials, sustained by a faith and hope which cheered them\r\non their pilgrimage through all their married days.\r\n\r\nThose of us who have reached years of maturity and are here with wives\r\nand husbands and children and children’s children, may in fancy’s\r\ntelescopic vision see the youthful pair leaving the old for the new\r\nworld, whispering to each other with brimful eyes and quivering lips:\r\n\r\n             “Go where we will, this hand in thine,\r\n               Those eyes before me smiling thus,\r\n             Through good and ill, through storm and shine,\r\n               The world’s a world of love for us.”\r\n\r\nAnd such has been the world to them. Love has been their guiding star;\r\nno cloud ever obscured it, and the darker the day of adversity the\r\nbrighter shone their love which bathed their home and our home in its\r\nmellow, cheering light.\r\n\r\nIn celebrating this golden wedding anniversary, all the halcyon days of\r\nour lives are included and there come to us messages from the past,\r\nunder the sea and over the land, burdened with the aroma of violets and\r\nroses, caught from the flower gardens of memory, planted in youth and\r\nblooming in perennial beauty to old age.\r\n\r\nI confess to you, my venerable parents, and to you my sisters and\r\nbrothers, and to those of younger generations, to overmastering emotions\r\nof love and gratitude as I survey this family scene, never to be\r\npictured again save upon the canvas of our memories. But I would voice\r\nno requiem note. Today our ears are not attuned to the dirge’s mournful\r\ncadence. This is not the occasion for planting weeping-willows, the\r\ncypress or the ivy vine—\r\n\r\n                  “Creeping where grim death is seen.”\r\n\r\nHere the mingled cup of love and gratitude and joy, brimful, is quaffed\r\nin honor of an event which to us all is a priceless benediction; but, if\r\nfrom its foundation a tear mingles with the draught to sparkle on the\r\nbrim of the loving cup, it bears testimony that our hearts are touched\r\nby feelings as divine as ever sanctified human affection.\r\n\r\nThe serenity, the rare loveliness of this scene create emotions which no\r\nwords, however fitly chosen, can express. I can but say in the name of\r\nmy sisters and my brothers and those younger in the bonds of family\r\nallegiance to our father—the patriarch of these sons and daughters—that\r\nwe tender him our warmest congratulations upon this rare occasion. When\r\nwe greet him our hearts are in our hands; when we kiss his time-furrowed\r\ncheeks our hearts are on our lips, and when we congratulate him upon\r\nthis, his golden wedding anniversary, our hearts are in our words.\r\n\r\nFreely do we avow the fealty of our love for his devotion to us, his\r\nchildren, for his watchful guardianship over our giddy footsteps on\r\nyouth’s flowery pathways; and this love is blended with profound\r\nveneration for his courage, which no vicissitude could dampen; for his\r\nmasculine virtues which have endeared him to the home circle; for his\r\nspotless integrity of character which has given him the confidence of\r\nmen, whether in poverty’s vale or upon the more elevated plane of\r\nprosperity, secured by industry and frugality, and above all, for that\r\nparental ambition and self-denial to secure for us an education which\r\nshould equip his children for respectable and honorable positions in\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThis, my beloved and honored sire, is the tribute of affection your\r\nchildren bring to you today. Your tender and unceasing devotion has won\r\nthe overflowing gratitude of our hearts, and this thankfulness, this\r\nabounding sense of obligation, dearest father, we children with the\r\nfingers of our love weave today into a crown and place it on your\r\nvenerable head, and though the years shall continue to whiten your\r\nlocks, dim the lustre of your eyes and impair the strength of your manly\r\nform, the wealth of our affection shall ever increase, nor shall it\r\ncease when the silver cord be loosed and at the final goal you lay all\r\nyour burdens down.\r\n\r\nAnd now our happy family circle, rejoicing in kindred ties, will fill\r\nagain the sparkling cup with the ambrosia of affection that we may drink\r\nto:\r\n\r\n                  “My mother’s voice! how often creep\r\n                    Its accents on my lonely hours.\r\n                  Like healing sent on wings of sleep,\r\n                    Or dew to the unconscious flowers.\r\n                  I can forget her melting prayer\r\n                    While leaping pulses madly fly,\r\n                  But in the still, unbroken air\r\n                    Her gentle tone comes stealing by—\r\n                  And years, and sin, and folly flee,\r\n                    And leave me at my mother’s knee.”\r\n\r\nThere are two words in our language forever sacred to memory—Mother and\r\nHome! Home, the heaven upon earth, and mother its presiding angel. To\r\nus, children, here today, mother and home have realized all the longing,\r\nyearning aspirations of our souls, and now, in this blissful presence,\r\nwe quaff to our mother this cup full and overflowing with the divine\r\nnectar of our love. I need not attempt to recite her deeds of devotion.\r\nThere is not a page of our memory, not a table of our hearts, that is\r\nnot adorned and beautified by acts of her loving care, in which her\r\nheart and her hands, her eyes and her soul, in holy alliance, ministered\r\nto our happiness.\r\n\r\nThere was never a time when there was not a song in her heart, sweeter\r\nthan Æolian melody, wooing her children from folly to the blessedness,\r\nsecurity, peace and contentment of home. Her children were her jewels in\r\nhome’s shining circle, and if by the fiat of death a gem dropped away,\r\nthe affectionate care it had received added soulful charm to her lullaby\r\nsongs when at night she dismissed us and sent us to dreamland repose.\r\n\r\nYears of duty and trial, anxiety and care have bowed her form, whitened\r\nher hair, dimmed her eyes and robbed her cheeks of their maiden bloom;\r\nbut O, our mother is still to us our beautiful mother. Her heart is as\r\nyoung and loving as when in infancy, in youth and in riper years it\r\nthrobbed responsive to our plaints; her hands are as beautiful in our\r\neyes as when in our childhood they were laid caressingly upon our heads,\r\nand her dimpled fingers smoothed our hair or wooded back to order our\r\ntruant tresses, and her voice, though less resonant than in the years\r\nwhen she called us from play to duty, has the same cadence as when\r\nbending over us she sang the cradle song which lulled to sleep and to\r\ndreams.\r\n\r\nO, our mother! beloved more than any wealth of words could express, your\r\nchildren on this anniversary day of your wedding fifty years ago, offer\r\nyou, aye shower upon you in the name of filial devotion, all the holiest\r\ntreasures of garnered affection.\r\n\r\n                  “We give thee all, we can no more,\r\n                    Though poor the offering be;\r\n                  Our hearts—our love is all the store\r\n                    And this we bring to thee.”\r\n\r\nWe hear the wedding bells ringing in celebration of the nuptials of our\r\naged parents—our ears are attuned to their merry chimes and our hearts\r\nrespond with all the joyousness of a wedding march, for peace and\r\nhappiness and contentment crown the hour. We do not ask what the future\r\nhas in store, we only know that we have the bride and groom in our\r\npresence, and that it is an inexpressible joy to pledge them anew our\r\nunfaltering devotion and our eternal love.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               The Issue\r\n\r\n                 _Speech at Girard, Kas., May 23, 1908_\r\n\r\n  [NOTE.—Girard, Kansas, is a quiet little city built about a\r\n  capacious plaza or square. This plaza is carpeted with Nature’s\r\n  emerald and roofed with the protecting branches of the catalpa and\r\n  the elm tree. When the news came that Debs had again been chosen as\r\n  the candidate of the Socialists for that station in our public\r\n  affairs of most comprehensive service to the people, the citizens,\r\n  without reference to political faiths, gathered upon this green out\r\n  of compliment to their fellow-townsman who had been thus honored for\r\n  the third time by such signal confidence on the part of so many\r\n  earnest people of the nation at large. These good people of Girard\r\n  had seen bevies of children following this arch “undesirable\r\n  citizen” to and from his work, and about the town in his resting\r\n  hours, for almost the entire period of his residence here, and now\r\n  it had come to pass that he was loved by every man, woman and child\r\n  here. They sent for him. Eli Richardson, the “Hot Cinders”\r\n  Socialist, affectionately known for so long a time as “Baldy,”\r\n  explained in a few dramatic words the occasion of the gathering, and\r\n  presented Debs with the remark, “You can pin your faith to a man\r\n  loved by children.” The address which follows, wholly impromptu, is\r\n  perhaps the most remarkable ever delivered, and came hot from the\r\n  foundry of his mighty genius and fresh from the loom of his kindly,\r\n  loyal, loving soul.]\r\n\r\n\r\nComrades, Ladies and Gentlemen: When I made inquiry a few moments ago as\r\nto the cause of this assembling I was told that it was the beginning of\r\nanother street fair. I am quite surprised, and agreeably so, to find\r\nmyself the central attraction. Allow me in the very beginning to express\r\nmy heartiest appreciation of the more than kind and generous words which\r\nhave been spoken here for me this afternoon. There are times when\r\nwords—mere words—no matter how fitly chosen or well expressed—are almost\r\nmeaningless. As the rosebud under the influence of sunshine and shower\r\nopens, so does my heart receive your benediction this afternoon.\r\n\r\nI am a new resident of Girard; have been here but a comparatively short\r\ntime, and yet I feel myself as completely at home among you, most of\r\nwhom disagree with me upon very vital questions, as I do in the town in\r\nwhich I was born and reared and have lived all the days of my life.\r\nSince the day I first came here I have been treated with uniform\r\nkindness. I could not have been treated more hospitably anywhere. I have\r\nmet practically all of your people, and all of them have taken me by the\r\nhand and treated me as cordially as if I had been neighbor and friend\r\nwith them; and to say that I appreciate this is to express myself in\r\nhackneyed and unsatisfactory terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         AS TO THE PRESIDENCY.\r\n\r\nThe honor to which reference has been made has come to me through no\r\nfault of my own. It has been said that some men are born great, some\r\nachieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them. It is even\r\nso with what are called honors. Some men have honors thrust upon them. I\r\nfind myself in that class. I did what little I could to prevent myself\r\nfrom being nominated by the convention now in session at Chicago, but\r\nthe nomination sought me out, and in spite of myself I stand in your\r\npresence this afternoon the nominee of the Socialist party for the\r\npresidency of the United States.\r\n\r\nLong, long ago I made up my mind never again to be a candidate for any\r\npolitical office within the gift of the people. I was constrained to\r\nviolate that vow because when I joined the Socialist party I was taught\r\nthat the desire of the individual was subordinate to the party will, and\r\nthat when the party commanded it was my duty to obey. There was a time\r\nin my life when I had the vanities of youth, when I sought that bubble\r\ncalled fame. I have outlived it. I have reached that point when I am\r\ncapable of placing an estimate upon my own relative insignificance. I\r\nhave come to realize that there is no honor in any real sense of that\r\nterm to any man unless he is capable of freely consecrating himself to\r\nthe service of his fellow men.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that I am able to help those who are unable to help\r\nthemselves, to that extent, and to that extent alone, do I honor myself\r\nand the party to which I belong. So far as the presidency of the United\r\nStates is concerned, I would spurn it were it not that it conferred the\r\npower to serve the working class, and he who enters that office with any\r\nother conception of it prostitutes and does not honor that office.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           BOUNTY OF NATURE.\r\n\r\nNow, my friends, I am opposed to the system of society in which we live\r\ntoday, not because I lack the natural equipment to do for myself, but\r\nbecause I am not satisfied to make myself comfortable knowing that there\r\nare thousands upon thousands of my fellow men who suffer for the barest\r\nnecessities of life. We were taught under the old ethic that man’s\r\nbusiness upon this earth was to look out for himself. That was the ethic\r\nof the jungle; the ethic of the wild beast. Take care of yourself, no\r\nmatter what may become of your fellow man. Thousands of years ago the\r\nquestion was asked: “Am I my brother’s keeper?” That question has never\r\nyet been answered in a way that is satisfactory to civilized society.\r\n\r\nYes, I am my brother’s keeper. I am under a moral obligation to him that\r\nis inspired, not by any maudlin sentimentality, but by the higher duty I\r\nowe to myself. What would you think of me if I were capable of seating\r\nmyself at a table and gorging myself with food and saw about me the\r\nchildren of my fellow beings starving to death?\r\n\r\nAllow me to say to you, my fellow men, that nature has spread a great\r\ntable bounteously for all of the children of men. There is room for all\r\nand there is a plate and a place and food for all, and any system of\r\nsociety that denies a single one the right and the opportunity to freely\r\nhelp himself to nature’s bounties is an unjust and iniquitous system\r\nthat ought to be abolished in the interest of a higher humanity and a\r\ncivilization worthy of the name. And here let me observe, my fellow men,\r\nthat while the general impression is that human society is stationary—a\r\nfinality as it were—it is not so for a single instant. Underlying\r\nsociety there are great material forces that are in operation all of the\r\ncircling hours of the day and night, and at certain points in the social\r\ndevelopment these forces outgrow the forms that hold them and these\r\nforms spring apart and then a new social system comes into existence and\r\na new era dawns for the human race.\r\n\r\nThe great majority of mankind have always been in darkness. The\r\noverwhelming majority of the children of men have always been their own\r\nworst enemies. In every age of this world’s history, the kings and\r\nemperors and czars and potentates, in alliance with the priests, have\r\nsought by all the means at their command to keep the people in darkness\r\nthat they might perpetuate the power in which they riot and revel in\r\nluxury while the great mass are in a state of slavery and degradation,\r\nand he who has spoken out courageously against the existing order, he\r\nwho has dared to voice the protest of the oppressed and downtrodden, has\r\nhad to pay the penalty, all the way from Jesus Christ of Galilee down to\r\nFred Warren of Girard.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     CORONATIONS AND CRUCIFIXIONS.\r\n\r\nDo you know, my friends, it is so easy to agree with the ignorant\r\nmajority. It is so easy to make the people applaud an empty platitude.\r\nIt takes some courage to face that beast called the Majority, and tell\r\nhim the truth to his teeth! Some men do so and accept the consequences\r\nof their acts as becomes men, and they live in history—every one of\r\nthem. I have said so often, and I wish to repeat it on this occasion,\r\nthat mankind have always crowned their oppressors, and they have as\r\nuniformly crucified their saviors, and this has been true all along the\r\nhighway of the centuries. It is true today. It will not always be so.\r\nWhen the great mass know the truth, they will treat an honest man\r\ndecently while he lives and not crucify him, and then a thousand years\r\nafterward rear a monument above the dust of the hero they put to death.\r\n\r\nI am in revolt against capitalism (and that doesn’t mean to say, my\r\nfriends, that I am hating you—not the slightest). I am opposed to\r\ncapitalism because I love my fellow men, and if I am opposing you I am\r\nopposing you for what I believe to be your good, and though you spat\r\nupon me with contempt I should still oppose you to the extent of my\r\npower.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NEW SYSTEM NEEDED.\r\n\r\nI don’t hate the workingman because he has turned against me. I know the\r\npoor fellow is too ignorant to understand his self-interest, and I know\r\nthat as a rule the workingman is the friend of his enemy and the enemy\r\nof his friend. He votes for men who represent a system in which labor is\r\nsimply merchandise; in which the man who works the hardest and longest\r\nhas the least to show for it.\r\n\r\nIf there is a man on this earth who is entitled to all the comforts and\r\nluxuries of this life in abundance it is the man whose labor produces\r\nthem. If he is not, who is? Does he get them in the present system?\r\n\r\nAnd, mark you, I am not speaking in a partisan sense this afternoon. I\r\nappreciate the fact that you have come here as republicans and democrats\r\nas well as Socialists to do me a personal honor, and I would be\r\nungrateful, indeed, if I took advantage of such an occasion to speak to\r\nyou in an offensive partisan sense. I wish to say in the broadest\r\npossible way that I am opposing the system under which we live today\r\nbecause I believe it is subversive of the best interests of the people.\r\nI am not satisfied with things as they are, and I know that no matter\r\nwhat administration is in power, even were it a Socialist\r\nadministration, there will be no material change in the condition of the\r\npeople until we have a new social system based upon the mutual economic\r\ninterests of the whole people; until you and I and all of us\r\ncollectively own those things that we collectively need and use.\r\n\r\nThat is a basic economic proposition. As long as a relatively few men\r\nown the railroads, the telegraph, the telephone, own the oil fields and\r\nthe gas fields and the steel mills and the sugar refineries and the\r\nleather tanneries—own, in short, the sources and means of life—they will\r\ncorrupt our politics, they will enslave the working class, they will\r\nimpoverish and debase society, they will do all things that are needful\r\nto perpetuate their power as the economic masters and the political\r\nrulers of the people. Not until these great agencies are owned and\r\noperated by the people can the people hope for any material improvement\r\nin their social condition.\r\n\r\nIs the condition fair today, and satisfactory to the thinking man?\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE UNEMPLOYED.\r\n\r\nAccording to the most reliable reports at our command, as I speak here\r\nthis afternoon there are at least four millions of workingmen vainly\r\nsearching for employment. Have you ever found yourself in that\r\nunspeakably sad predicament? Have you ever had to go up the street,\r\nbegging for work, in a great city thronged with humanity—and, by the\r\nway, my friends, people are never quite so strange to each other as when\r\nthey are forced into artificial, crowded and stifled relationship.\r\n\r\nI would rather be friendless out on the American desert than to be\r\nfriendless in New York or Chicago. Have you ever walked up one side of\r\nthe street and come back on the other side, while your wife, Mary, was\r\nwaiting at home with three or four children for you to report that you\r\nhad found work? Quite fortunately for me I had an experience of similar\r\nnature quite early in my life. Quite fortunately because, had I not\r\nknown from my own experience just what it is to have to beg for work,\r\njust what it is to be shown the door as if I were a very offensive\r\nintruder, had I not known what it is to suffer for the want of food, had\r\nI not seen every door closed and barred in my face, had I not found\r\nmyself friendless and alone in the city as a boy looking for work, and\r\nin vain, perhaps I would not be here this afternoon. I might have grown\r\nup, as some others have who have been, as they regard themselves,\r\nfortunate. I might have waved aside my fellowmen and said, “Do as I have\r\ndone. If you are without work it is your own fault. Look at me; I am\r\nself-made. No man is under the necessity of looking for work if he is\r\nwilling to work.”\r\n\r\nNothing is more humiliating than to have to beg for work, and a system\r\nin which any man has to beg for work stands condemned. No man can defend\r\nit. Now the rights of one are as sacred as the rights of a million.\r\nSuppose you happen to be the one who has no work. This republic is a\r\nfailure so far as you are concerned.\r\n\r\nEvery man has the inalienable right to work.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         EVOLUTION OF INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\nHere I stand, just as I was created. I have two hands that represent my\r\nlabor power. I have some bone and muscle and sinew and some energy. I\r\nwant to exchange the use of these for food and clothing and shelter. But\r\nbetween me and the tools with which work is done there stands a man\r\nartificially created. He says, “No, no!” Why not? “Because you cannot\r\nfirst make a profit for me.”\r\n\r\nNow, there has been a revolution in industry during the last fifty\r\nyears, but the trouble with most people is that they haven’t kept pace\r\nwith it. They don’t know anything about it and they are especially\r\ninnocent in regard to it in the small western cities and states, where\r\nthe same old conditions of a century ago still largely prevail. Your\r\ngrandfather could help himself anywhere. All he needed was some cheap,\r\nsimple primitive tools and he could then apply his labor to the\r\nresources of nature with his individual tools and produce what he\r\nneeded. That era in our history produced our greatest men. Lincoln\r\nhimself sprang from this primitive state of society. People have said,\r\n“Why, he had no chance. See how great he became.” Yes, but Lincoln had\r\nfor his comrades great, green-plumed forest monarchs. He could put his\r\narms about them and hear their heart-throbs, as they whispered: “Go on,\r\nAbe, a great destiny awaits you.” He was in partnership with nature. He\r\nassociated with birds and bees and flowers, and he was in the fields and\r\nheard the rippling music of the laughing brooks and streams. Nature took\r\nhim to her bosom and nourished him, and from his unpolluted heart there\r\nsprang his noble aspirations.\r\n\r\nHad Lincoln been born in a sweatshop he would never have been heard of.\r\n\r\nHow is it with the babe that is born in Mott street, or in the lower\r\nBowery, or in the east side of New York City? That is where thousands,\r\ntens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of babes are born who are to\r\nconstitute our future generations.\r\n\r\nI have seen children ten years of age in New York City who had never\r\nseen a live chicken. The babes there don’t know what it is to put their\r\ntiny feet on a blade of grass. It is the most densely populated spot on\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nYou have seen your bee-hive—just fancy a human bee-hive of which yours\r\nis the miniature and you have the industrial hive under capitalism. If\r\nyou have never seen this condition you are excusable for not being a\r\nSocialist. Come to New York, Chicago, San Francisco with me; remain with\r\nme just twenty-four hours, and then look into my face as I shall look\r\ninto yours when I ask: “What about Socialism now?” These children by\r\nhundreds and thousands are born in sub-cellars, where a whole grown\r\nfamily is crowded together in one room, where modesty between the sexes\r\nis absolutely impossible. They are surrounded by filth and vermin. From\r\ntheir birth they see nothing but immorality and vice and crime. They are\r\ntainted in the cradle. They are inoculated by their surroundings and\r\nthey are doomed from the beginning. This system takes their lives just\r\nas certainly as if a dagger were thrust into their quivering little\r\nhearts, and let me say to you that it were better for many thousands of\r\nthem if they had never seen the light.\r\n\r\nNow I submit, my friends, that such a condition as this is indefensible\r\nin the twentieth century. Time was when everything had to be done in a\r\nvery primitive way, and most men had to work all their days, all their\r\nlives, to feed and shelter themselves. They had no time, they had no\r\nopportunity for higher development, and so they were what the world\r\ncalls “illiterate.” They had little chance. It took all their time and\r\nenergy to feed the animal; but how is it today? Upon the average twenty\r\nmen can today, with the aid of modern machinery, produce as much wealth\r\nas a thousand did a half century ago. Can you think of a single thing\r\nthat enters into our daily existence that can not be easily produced in\r\nabundance for all? If you can I wish you would do me the kindness to\r\nname it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       WHY SUFFER AMID ABUNDANCE?\r\n\r\nI don’t know it all. I am simply a student of this great question, and I\r\nam serving as best I can and I know my eyes are ready for the light, and\r\nI thank that man, no matter what he be, who can add to the flame of the\r\ntorch I bear. If there is a single thing that you can think of that\r\ncannot be produced in abundance, name it. Bread, clothing,\r\nfuel—everything is here.\r\n\r\nNature’s storehouse is full to the surface of the earth. All of the raw\r\nmaterials are deposited here in abundance. We have the most marvelous\r\nmachinery the world has ever known. Man has long since become master of\r\nthe natural forces and made them work for him. Now he has but to touch a\r\nbutton and the wheels begin to spin and the machinery to whirr, and\r\nwealth is produced on every hand in increasing abundance.\r\n\r\nWhy should any man, woman or child suffer for food, clothing or shelter?\r\nWhy? The question cannot be answered. Don’t tell me that some men are\r\ntoo lazy to work. Suppose they are too lazy to work, what do you think\r\nof a social system that produces men too lazy to work? If a man is too\r\nlazy to work don’t treat him with contempt. Don’t look down upon him\r\nwith scorn as if you were a superior being. If there is a man who is too\r\nlazy to work there is something the matter with him. He wasn’t born\r\nright or he was perverted in this system. You could not, if you tried,\r\nkeep a normal man inactive, and if you did he would go stark mad. Go to\r\nany penitentiary and you will find the men there begging for the\r\nprivilege of doing work.\r\n\r\nI know by close study of the question exactly how men become idle. I\r\ndon’t repel them when I meet them. I have never yet seen the tramp I was\r\nnot able to receive with open arms. He is a little less fortunate than I\r\nam. He is made the same as I am made. He is a child of the same Father.\r\nHad I been born in his environment, had I been subjected to the same\r\nthings to which he was I would have been where he is.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           TOOLS AND TRAMPS.\r\n\r\nCan you tell me why there wasn’t a tramp in the United States in 1860?\r\nIn that day, if some one had said “tramp,” no one would have known what\r\nwas meant by it. If human nature is innately depraved and men would\r\nrather ride on brake-beams and sleep in holes and caves instead of\r\ncomfortable beds, if they would do that from pure choice and from\r\nnatural depravity, why were they not built that way fifty years ago?\r\nFifty years ago capitalism was in its earlier stages. Fifty years ago\r\nwork was still mainly done by hand, and every boy could learn a trade\r\nand every boy could master the tools and go to work. That is why there\r\nwere no tramps. In fifty years that simple tool has become a mammoth\r\nmachine. It gets larger and larger all the time. It has crowded the hand\r\ntool out of production. With the machine came the capitalist.\r\n\r\nThere were no capitalists, nor was there such a thing as capital before\r\nthe beginning of the present system. Capitalists came with machinery. Up\r\nto the time that machinery supplanted the hand tool the little employer\r\nwas himself a workingman. No matter what the shop or factory, you would\r\nfind the employer working side by side with his men. He was a superior\r\nworkman who got more orders than he could fill and employed others to\r\nhelp him, but he had to pay them the equivalent of what they produced\r\nbecause if he did not they would pack up their tools and go into\r\nbusiness for themselves.\r\n\r\nNow, the individual tool has become the mammoth machine. It has\r\nmultiplied production by hundreds. The old tool was individually owned\r\nand used. The modern tool, in the form of a great machine, is social in\r\nevery conception of it. Look at one of these giant machines. Come to the\r\nAppeal office and look at the press in operation. Here the progressive\r\nconception of the ages is crystallized. What individual shall put his\r\nhand on this social agency and say, “This is mine! He who would apply\r\nlabor here must first pay tribute to me.”\r\n\r\nThe hand tool has been very largely supplanted by this machine. Not many\r\ntools are left. You are still producing in a very small way here in\r\nGirard, but your production is flickering out gradually. It is but a\r\nquestion of time until it will expire entirely. In spite of all that can\r\nbe said or done to the contrary production is organizing upon a larger\r\nand larger scale and becoming entirely co-operative. This has crowded\r\nout the smaller competitor and gradually opened the way for a new social\r\norder.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        WILL MAKE HOME POSSIBLE.\r\n\r\nYour material interest and mine in the society of the future will be the\r\nsame. Instead of having to fight each other like animals, as we do\r\ntoday, and seeking to glorify the brute struggle for existence—of which\r\nevery civilized human being ought to be ashamed—instead of this, our\r\nmaterial interests are going to be mutual. We are going to jointly own\r\nthese mammoth machines, and we are going to operate them as joint\r\npartners and we are going to divide all the products among ourselves.\r\n\r\nWe are not going to send our surplus to the Goulds and Vanderbilts of\r\nNew York. We are not going to pile up a billion of dollars in John D.\r\nRockefeller’s hands—a vast pyramid from the height of which he can look\r\ndown with scorn and contempt upon the “common herd.” John D.\r\nRockefeller’s great fortune is built upon your ignorance. When you know\r\nenough to know what your interest is you will support the great party\r\nthat is organized upon the principle of collective ownership of the\r\nmeans of life. This party will sweep into power upon the issue of\r\nemancipation just as republicanism swept into power upon the abolition\r\nquestion half a century ago.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, don’t have any fear of us Socialists. We don’t mean any\r\nharm! Many of you have been taught to look upon us as very dangerous\r\npeople. It is amazing to what extent this prejudice has struck root. The\r\ncapitalist press will tell you of a good many evil things that we\r\nSocialists are going to do that we never intend to do. They will tell\r\nyou we are going to break up the home. Great heaven! What about the\r\nhomes of the four million tramps that are looking for work today? How\r\nabout the thousands and thousands of miserable shacks in New York and\r\nevery great city where humanity festers? It would be a good thing if\r\nthey were torn down and obliterated completely, for they are not fit for\r\nhuman habitation. No, we are not going to destroy the home, but we are\r\ngoing to make the home possible for the first time in history.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      PROGRESS BORN OF AGITATION.\r\n\r\nYou may think you are very comfortable. Let me make you a little\r\ncomparison. You may not agree with me. I don’t expect you to and I don’t\r\nask you to. I am going to ask you to remember what I say this afternoon\r\nand perhaps before I am elected president of the United States you will\r\nbelieve what I say is true. Now there are those of you who are fairly\r\ncomfortable under the present standard. Isn’t it amazing to you how\r\nlittle the average man is satisfied with? You go out here to the edge of\r\ntown and you find a small farmer who has a cabin with just room enough\r\nto keep himself and wife and two or three children, which has a mortgage\r\non it, and he works early and late and gets just enough in net returns\r\nto keep him in working order, and he will deliver a lecture about the\r\nwonderful prosperity of the country.\r\n\r\nHe is satisfied, and that is his calamity.\r\n\r\nNow, the majority of you would say that is his good fortune. “It is a\r\nblessing that he is satisfied.” I want to see if I can show you that it\r\nis a curse to him and to society that he is satisfied.\r\n\r\nIf it had not been for the discontent of a few fellows who have not been\r\nsatisfied with their condition you would still be living in caves. You\r\nnever would have emerged from the jungle. Intelligent discontent is the\r\nmainspring of civilization.\r\n\r\nProgress is born of agitation. It is agitation or stagnation. I have\r\ntaken my choice.\r\n\r\nThis farmer works all day long, works hard enough to produce enough to\r\nlive the life of a man; not of an animal, but of a man. Now there is an\r\nessential difference between a man and an animal. I admire a magnificent\r\nanimal in any form except in the human form. Suppose you had everything\r\nthat you could possibly desire, so far as your physical wants are\r\nconcerned. Suppose you had a million to your credit in the bank, a\r\npalatial home and relations to suit yourself, but no soul capacity for\r\nreal enjoyment. If you were denied knowing what sorrow is, what real joy\r\nis, what music is, and literature and sculpture, and all of those subtle\r\ninfluences that touch the heart and quicken the pulses and fire the\r\nsenses, and so lift and ennoble a man that he can feel his head among\r\nthe stars and in communion with God himself—if you are denied these, no\r\nmatter how sleek or fat or contented you may be, you are still as base\r\nand as corrupt and as repulsive a being as walks God’s green earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE FARMER’S NEED.\r\n\r\nYou may have plenty of money. The poorest people on this earth are those\r\nwho have most money. A man is said to be poor who has none, but he is a\r\npauper who has nothing else. Now this farmer, what does he know about\r\nliterature? After his hard day’s work is done, here he sits in his\r\nlittle shack. He is fed, and his animal wants are satisfied. It is at\r\nthis time that a man begins to live. It is not while you work and slave\r\nthat you live. It is when you have done your work honestly, when you\r\nhave contributed your share to the common fund, that you begin to live.\r\nThen, as Whitman said, you can take out your soul; you can commune with\r\nyourself; you can take a comrade by the hand and you can look into his\r\neyes and down into his soul, and in that holy communion you live. And if\r\nyou don’t know what that is, or if you are not at least on the edge of\r\nit, it is denied you to even look into the promised land.\r\n\r\nNow this farmer knows nothing about the literature of the world. All its\r\nlibraries are sealed to him. So far as he is concerned; Homer and Dante\r\nand Dickens might as well not have lived; Beethoven, Liszt and Wagner,\r\nand all those musicians whose art makes the common atmosphere blossom\r\nwith harmony, never have been for this farmer. He knows nothing about\r\npoetry or art. Never rises above the animal plane upon which he is\r\nliving. Within fifteen minutes after he has ceased to live he is\r\nforgotten; the next generation doesn’t know his name, and the world\r\ndoesn’t know he ever lived. That is life under the present standard.\r\n\r\nYou tell me that is all the farmer is fit for? What do I propose to do\r\nfor that farmer? Nothing. I only want him to know that he is robbed\r\nevery day in the week, and if I can awaken him to the fact that he is\r\nrobbed under the capitalist system he will fall into line with the\r\nSocialist movement, and will march to the polls on election day, and\r\ninstead of casting his vote to fasten the shackles upon his limbs more\r\nfirmly, he will vote for his emancipation. All I have to do is to show\r\nthat farmer, that day laborer, that tramp, that they are victims of this\r\nsystem, that their interests are identical, that they constitute the\r\nmillions and that the millions have the votes. The Rockefellers have the\r\ndollars, but we have the votes; and when we have sense enough to know\r\nhow to use the votes we will have not only the votes but the dollars for\r\nall the children of men.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    WHO WILL SAVE US FROM CONGRESS?\r\n\r\nThis seems quite visionary to some of you, and especially to those of\r\nyou who know nothing about economics. I could not begin to tell you the\r\nstory of social evolution this afternoon; of how these things are doing\r\nday by day, of how the world is being pushed into Socialism, and how it\r\nis bound to arrive, no matter whether you are for it or against it. It\r\nis the next inevitable phase of civilization. It isn’t a scheme, it\r\nisn’t a contrivance. It isn’t anything that is made to order. The day is\r\ncoming when you will be pushed into it by unseen hands whether you will\r\nor not. Nothing can be introduced until the people want it, and when the\r\nmajority want it they will know how to get it.\r\n\r\nI venture the prophecy that within the next five years you will be\r\ncompletely dispossessed. You are howling against the trusts, and the\r\ntrusts are laughing at you. You keep on voting in the same old way and\r\nthe trusts keep on getting what you produce. You say congress will give\r\nyou some relief. Good heavens! Who will save us from congress? Don’t you\r\nknow that congress is made up almost wholly of trust lawyers and\r\ncorporation attorneys? I don’t happen to have the roll of this one, but\r\nwith few exceptions they are all lawyers. Now, in the competitive system\r\nthe lawyer sells himself to the highest bidder the same as the\r\nworkingman does. Who is the highest bidder? The trust and corporation,\r\nof course. So the trust buys the best lawyer and the common herd gets\r\nthe shyster.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     POLITICS REFLEX OF ECONOMICS.\r\n\r\nNow it is a fact that politics is simply the reflex of economics. The\r\nmaterial foundation of society determines the character of all social\r\ninstitutions—political, educational, ethical and spiritual. In exact\r\nproportion as the economic foundation of society changes the character\r\nof all social institutions changes to correspond to that basis. Half of\r\nthis country was in favor of chattel slavery, and half was opposed to\r\nit, geographically speaking. Why was the church of the south in favor of\r\nchattel slavery? Why was the church of the north opposed to chattel\r\nslavery? The northern capitalist wasn’t a bit more opposed to chattel\r\nslavery from any moral sense than was the southern plantation owner. The\r\nsouth produced cotton for the market by the hand labor of negro slaves.\r\nOn the other hand, the north wasn’t dependent upon cotton—could raise no\r\ncotton. In the north it was the small capitalist at the beginning of\r\ncapitalism, who, with the machine, had begun to manufacture, and wanted\r\ncheap labor; and the sharper the competition the cheaper he could buy\r\nhis labor. Now, chattel slavery to the southern plantation owner was the\r\nsource of his wealth. He had to have slaves, and what the plantation\r\nowner had to have in economics the preacher had to justify in religion.\r\nAs long as chattel slavery was necessary to the southern plantation\r\nowner, as long as that stage of the economic condition lasted, the\r\npreachers stood up in the pulpits of the south and said it was ordained\r\nof God, and proved it by the Bible. I don’t know of any crime that the\r\noppressors and their hirelings have not proven by the Bible.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        ANALOGIES FROM HISTORY.\r\n\r\nThen competition between workers began as machines took the place of\r\nhand labor. Manufacturers wanted larger and larger bodies of labor and\r\nthat competition spread out here to Kansas, and I have always felt when\r\nin Kansas that I stood on sacred soil. When I hear the name of Kansas I\r\ndoff my hat in reverence. The free soilers came here, despised, hated\r\nand persecuted. They were the enemies of the human race. Why? Because\r\nthey had hearts throbbing within their breasts. Because they looked with\r\ncompassion upon the negro slave who received his wages in lashes applied\r\nto his naked back; who saw his crying wife torn from him and his\r\nchildren, pleading, snatched from his side and sold into slavery, while\r\nthe great mass looked on just as the great mass is looking on today, and\r\nthe preachers stood up in their pulpits and said: “It is all right. It\r\nis God-ordained.” And whenever an abolitionist raised his head he was\r\npersecuted and hounded as if he had been a wild beast.\r\n\r\nI heard this story from Wendell Phillips one evening. I never can forget\r\nit. How I wish he were here this afternoon! We sat together and he said:\r\n“Debs, the world will never know with what bitter and relentless\r\npersecution the early abolitionists had to contend.”\r\n\r\nWendell Phillips was the most perfect aristocrat in the true sense I\r\nhave ever seen; came nearest being a perfect man. And yet he was treated\r\nas if he had been the worst felon on earth. They went to his house one\r\nnight to mob him, and why? Because he protested against sending a young\r\nnegro girl back into slavery. They came to take her back, and the whole\r\ncommonwealth of Massachusetts said, “Take her back! Obey the law!” That\r\nis what they are everlastingly saying to us—“Obey the law!” Just above\r\nthe door of the state house there was an inscription: “God bless the\r\nCommonwealth of Massachusetts.” Wendell Phillips said: “If Massachusetts\r\nhas become a slave hunter, if Massachusetts is in alliance with the\r\nslave catchers of the south, the inscription over that portal should be\r\nchanged, and in place of ‘God Bless the Commonwealth of Massachusetts’\r\nit should be: ‘God Damn the Commonwealth of Massachusetts!’” God smiled\r\nin that same instant.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          GROWTH OF SOCIALISM.\r\n\r\nAll of the slave catchers and holders, all of the oppressors of man, all\r\nof the enemies of the human race, all of the rulers of Siberia, where a\r\nlarge part of this earth’s surface has been transformed into a hell—all\r\nhave spoken in the name of the Great God and in the name of the Holy\r\nBible.\r\n\r\nThere will be a change one of these days. The world is just beginning to\r\nawaken, and is soon to sing its first anthem of freedom. All the signs\r\nof the times are cheering. Twenty-five years ago there was but a handful\r\nof Socialists; today there are a half million. When the polls are closed\r\nnext fall you will be astounded. The Socialist movement is in alliance\r\nwith the forces of progress. We are today where the abolitionists were\r\nin 1858. They had a million and a quarter of votes. There was dissension\r\nin the whig, republican and free soil parties, but the time had come for\r\na great change, and the republican party was formed in spite of the\r\nbickerings and contentions of men. Lincoln made the great speech in that\r\nyear that gave him the nomination and afterward made him president of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nIf you had said to the people in 1858, “In two years from now the\r\nrepublican party is going to sweep the country and seat the president,”\r\nyou would have been laughed to scorn. The Socialist party stands today\r\nwhere the republican party stood fifty years ago. It is in alliance with\r\nthe forces of evolution, the one party that has a clear-cut,\r\novermastering, overshadowing issue; the party that stands for the\r\npeople, and the only party that stands for all the people. In this\r\nsystem we have one set who are called capitalists, and another set who\r\nare called workers; and they are at war with each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    WILL ESTABLISH PRIVATE PROPERTY.\r\n\r\nNow, we Socialists propose that society in its collective capacity shall\r\nproduce, not for profit, but in abundance to satisfy human wants; that\r\nevery man shall have the inalienable right to work, and receive the full\r\nequivalent of all he produces; that every man may stand fearlessly erect\r\nin the pride and majesty of his own manhood.\r\n\r\nEvery man and every woman will then be economically free. They can,\r\nwithout let or hindrance, apply their labor, with the best machinery\r\nthat can be devised, to all the natural resources, do the work of\r\nsociety and produce for all; and then receive in exchange a certificate\r\nof value equivalent to that of their production. Then society will\r\nimprove its institutions in proportion to the progress of invention.\r\nWhether in the city or on the farm, all things productive will be\r\ncarried forward on a gigantic scale. All industry will be completely\r\norganized. Society for the first time will have a scientific foundation.\r\nEvery man, by being economically free, will have some time for himself.\r\nHe can then take a full and perfect breath. He can enjoy life with his\r\nwife and children, because then he will have a home.\r\n\r\nWe are not going to destroy private property. We are going to establish\r\nprivate property—all the private property necessary to house man, keep\r\nhim in comfort and satisfy his wants. Eighty per cent of the people of\r\nthe United States have no property today. A few have got it all. They\r\nhave dispossessed the people, and when we get into power we will\r\ndispossess them. We will reduce the workday and give every man a chance.\r\nWe will go to the parks, and we will have music, because we will have\r\ntime to play music and desire to hear it.\r\n\r\nIs it not sad to think that not one in a thousand knows what music is?\r\nIs it not pitiable to see the poor, ignorant, dumb human utterly\r\nimpervious to the divine influences of music? If humanity could only\r\nrespond to the higher influences! And it would if it had time.\r\n\r\nRelease the animal, throw off his burden; give him a chance and he rises\r\nas if by magic to the plane of a man. Man has all of the divine\r\nattributes. They are in a latent state. They are not yet developed. It\r\ndoes not pay now to love music. Keep your eye on the almighty dollar and\r\nyour fellowman. Get the dollar and keep him down. Make him produce for\r\nyou. You are not your brother’s keeper. Suppose he is poor! Suppose his\r\nwife is forced into prostitution! Suppose his child is deformed! And\r\nsuppose he shuffles off by destroying himself! What is that to you?\r\n\r\nBut you ought to be ashamed. Take the standard home and look it in the\r\nface. If you know what that standard means, and you are a success, God\r\nhelp the failure!\r\n\r\nOur conduct is determined by our economic relations. If you and I must\r\nfight each other to exist, we will not love each other very hard. We can\r\ngo to the same church and hear the same minister tell us in good\r\nconscience that we ought to love each other, and the next day we\r\napproach some business transaction. Do we remember what the minister\r\ntold us? No; it is gone until next Sunday. Six days in the week we are\r\nfollowing the Golden Rule reversed. Now, when we approach a business\r\ntransaction in competition, what is more natural than that we should try\r\nto get the better of it?—get the better of our fellowman?—cheat him if\r\nwe can?\r\n\r\nAnd if you succeed that fixes you as a business man. You have all the\r\nnecessary qualifications. Don’t let your conscience disturb you—that\r\nwould interfere with business.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        HUMANITY AND THE FUTURE.\r\n\r\nCompetition was natural enough at one time, but do you think you are\r\ncompeting today? Many of you think you are competing. Against whom?\r\nAgainst Rockefeller? About as I would if I had a wheelbarrow and\r\ncompeted with the Santa Fe from here to Kansas City. That is about the\r\nway you are competing; but your boys will not have even that chance—if\r\ncapitalism lives that long. You hear of the “late” panic. It is very\r\nlate. It is going to be very late. This panic will be with us five years\r\nfrom now, and will continue till then.\r\n\r\nI am not a prophet. I can no more penetrate the future than you can. I\r\ndo study the forces that underlie society and the trend of evolution. I\r\ncan tell by what we have passed through about what we will have in the\r\nfuture; and I know that capitalism can be abolished and the people put\r\nin possession. Now, when we have taken possession, and we jointly own\r\nthe means of production, we will no longer have to fight each other to\r\nlive; our interests, instead of being competitive, will be coöperative.\r\nWe will work side by side. Your interest will be mine and mine will be\r\nyours. That is the economic condition from which will spring the humane\r\nsocial relation of the future.\r\n\r\nWhen we are in partnership and have stopped clutching each other’s\r\nthroats, when we have stopped enslaving each other, we will stand\r\ntogether, hands clasped, and be friends. We will be comrades, we will be\r\nbrothers, and we will begin the march to the grandest civilization the\r\nhuman race has ever known.\r\n\r\nI did not mean to keep you so long this afternoon. I am sure I\r\nappreciate the patience with which you have listened to me. From the\r\nvery depths of my heart I thank you, each of you—every man, woman and\r\nchild—for this splendid testimonial, this beautiful tribute, which I\r\nshall remember with gratitude and love until memory empties its urn into\r\nforgetfulness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             APPRECIATIONS\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n                        FREDERIC AUGUSTE BARTHOLDI\r\n\r\n      The great sculptor who modeled the colossal statue, “Liberty\r\n    Enlightening the World,” in New York harbor, wrote of Debs:\r\n\r\n      “He is endowed with the most precious faculty to which one can\r\n    aspire—the gift of language, and he uses it for the proclamation of\r\n    the most beautiful and generous thoughts. His beautiful language is\r\n    that of an apostle.”\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Mr. Debs an Artist in Expression\r\n\r\nIf the use of language to express thought is an art, Mr. Debs is an\r\nartist. If oratory is a science, he is a master of the science. If\r\neloquence reaches and takes hold of the hearts and emotions of mankind,\r\nMr. Debs has that which will make his auditors stand and deliver the\r\ngoods. His address lasted over two hours and at its close, not only men,\r\nbut women, surged to the platform to grasp his hand and congratulate\r\nhim. This is something unique, for while it is customary for men to do\r\nso with labor leaders, women generally stay in the background if they\r\nattend these meetings at all.—_Detroit Times._\r\n\r\n\r\n                        From Woodstock to Boise\r\n\r\n          _Walter Hurt in Appeal to Reason, November 23, 1907_\r\n\r\nCapitalism made its first great mistake when it put Eugene V. Debs in\r\njail. It made its second great mistake when it put William D. Haywood in\r\njail. And it adds to its mistakes every time it wrongfully imprisons any\r\nmember of the working class.\r\n\r\nWoodstock was plutocracy’s Waterloo and Boise was its Bull Run.\r\n\r\nDebs entered jail a labor agitator and emerged therefrom a Social\r\nRevolutionist.\r\n\r\nHaywood went to prison defeated and left it victorious.\r\n\r\nIn each case it was a transformation and a triumph.\r\n\r\nIt should be understood that the word “defeat” is here used merely as a\r\nterm of convenience. No man is truly defeated unless he is conquered,\r\nand Debs and Haywood are unconquerable.\r\n\r\nMoreover, whatever its reverses, there can be no defeat for a righteous\r\ncause, for in the eternal equipoise of social conservation—\r\n\r\n                    “Ever will right come uppermost\r\n                    And ever will justice be done.”\r\n\r\nAnd these celebrated cases are not exceptional, for history proves that,\r\ndespite the purpose for which they were designed, prisons have always\r\nbeen the instruments of progress—unfailing agencies of human\r\nadvancement.\r\n\r\nThe path of progress extends undeviating from Woodstock to Boise. The\r\nexperience of a Debs was necessary to the evolvement of a Haywood.\r\n\r\nIn their effort to destroy Debs the money-masters overreached\r\nthemselves. They crushed the American Railway Union—crushed it into the\r\ncohesion of the Social Democracy.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to observe this operation—to watch the metamorphosis\r\nof Debs and trace the evolution of the industrial movement from the date\r\nof his imprisonment; in this process we find the philosophy of progress,\r\nthe development of the social purpose.\r\n\r\nBoth Debs and his persecutors were involuntary instruments of sovereign\r\neconomic forces; the latter an unconscious agency, responding blindly to\r\nconservatory impulsion, the former obedient to an intelligent enthusiasm\r\nlogically directed toward a definite and an attainable object.\r\n\r\nUnder the pressure of prison walls Debs’ dynamic being developed until\r\nits expanding forces found expression in the Socialist idea, of which\r\nhis own potent personality was the informing influence.\r\n\r\nFrom the corporate wreck of the A. R. U. the Social Democracy was\r\norganized. Debs reformed this disintegration, he was the atom of\r\nattraction; his irresistible individuality was the core to which the\r\nothers cohered—the compelling factor that drew to an integrative\r\ncoalescence the shattered, scattered remnants of a vast industrial\r\norganism as surely as a magnet draws the metal.\r\n\r\nThe Pullman strike was not lost. It was won decisively and completely. A\r\nmovement for industrial liberation as magnificent in its scope as any\r\ncampaign of the immortal Corsican, had succeeded. For the first time in\r\nhistory Plutocracy was paralyzed in the clutch of Toil, directed by a\r\nman of intelligence and integrity.\r\n\r\nBut victory was plucked from the grasp of the strikers by the strong\r\nhand of federal power. They were robbed of the sweet fruits of their\r\nbitter struggle by the wealth-won favor of presidential authority.\r\n\r\nThis result puzzled Debs. He couldn’t understand how such a tremendous\r\ntriumph could be turned into defeat.\r\n\r\nHe had to go to jail to find the solution of the problem.\r\n\r\nIn jail he studied Socialism. And straightway a great illumination burst\r\nupon his intelligence.\r\n\r\nHe turned from craft-consciousness to class-consciousness.\r\n\r\nIt was revealed to him that the entire theory of industrial organization\r\nas it existed was fundamentally false. He realized that any social\r\nbenefit to be large and lasting must be also universal.\r\n\r\nMoreover, he came to know the reason for the failure of the Pullman\r\nstrike after it had been fairly and fully won; and he understood then\r\nthat revolution was the only remedy for economic ills and that the only\r\nhope for government protection of proletarian interests lay in the\r\ncapture of governmental power.\r\n\r\nFrom the narrow confines of his cell and the not less narrow confines of\r\ncraft interest he simultaneously stepped into physical freedom and into\r\nthe world-wide sweep of the Social Revolution.\r\n\r\nDebs had been so dangerous that the masters deemed it advisable to send\r\nhim to jail. He left that prison a thousand times more dangerous than\r\nwhen he entered it.\r\n\r\nFor Debs _is_ dangerous. This is the one truth plutocracy tells about\r\nhim. He’s as dangerous as dynamite—to capitalistic interests.\r\n\r\nCapitalism thought it had destroyed Debs. It merely had made him.\r\n\r\nHis cell was a chrysalis, from which his soul came forth with unfurled\r\nwings.\r\n\r\nDefeat cannot come to such a man as Debs. His triumphal return to\r\nChicago after his release from Woodstock jail is neither paralleled nor\r\napproximated in all history except by Napoleon’s victorious march upon\r\nParis after his escape from Elba.\r\n\r\nThe kindest thing ever done to Debs was the act of his enemies. The\r\ngreatest blessing mankind has received was bestowed by those who sought\r\nto enslave it.\r\n\r\nWhen it sentenced Debs to jail, Capitalism signed its own death warrant.\r\n\r\nDebs’ career from November 22, 1895, to July 28, 1907, spanning the\r\nyears from Woodstock to Boise, forms the seven-hued bow of proletarian\r\npromise.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Here Comes a Man\r\n\r\n                          _By George Bicknell_\r\n\r\n                Here comes a man with one free call;\r\n                  He shouts aloud nor does he fear\r\n                  The foolish threat of deafened ear;\r\n                Nor does he heed who would enthrall.\r\n\r\n                Here comes a man with love for men\r\n                  As pure and broad as boundless space;\r\n                  He gathers light from every race,\r\n                And sheds it on the world again.\r\n\r\n                His joy is not alone for self;\r\n                  His life makes gladsome whom he meets\r\n                  By turning bitter galls to sweets\r\n                And shaming every show of pelf.\r\n\r\n                Here comes a man whose like is rare;\r\n                  A kindred heart for hearts that bleed;\r\n                  A refuge in dark hours of need;\r\n                A burdened world his greatest care;\r\n\r\n                His call the call to Love and Faith,\r\n                  To Love and Faith and Liberty;\r\n                  But some decry, and some there be\r\n                Who say: “A Dream;” “A soulless wraith.”\r\n\r\n                Yet, though his call be but a dream,\r\n                  The love he sheds in spreading this\r\n                  Will give the world much lasting bliss\r\n                And purify a Hate-filled stream.\r\n\r\n                Then hail to him who loves so well!\r\n                  The Brother of the Poor; the Friend\r\n                  Of them that labor without end.\r\n                And hail the dawn he dares foretell!\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Without Guile\r\n\r\nNo man ever looked into the frank, blue eyes of Eugene V. Debs but felt\r\nthe thrill of seeing the open soul of a man without guile. In two years’\r\ndaily intercourse with him I never saw him change in mental attitude. He\r\nhas won the love of every person who has met and talked with him. His\r\nsoul takes in the universe. He is one of the great men who will leave\r\nhis footprints on the sands of the road of human uplift. Like all men\r\nwho have higher ideals than their time and generation, he will be better\r\nappreciated in the time to come. It is not that he is the peer of any\r\norator who ever addressed an American public, but that what he says goes\r\nto the root of things. It is what he says more than the beautiful way he\r\nsays it. It always reaches the heart, reaches the deep-hidden good that\r\nis in every creature. He is the same in the ordinary conversation that\r\nhe is on the platform. No man can look into his frank soul and refuse to\r\nlove him. His name will live in letters of light on the pages of the\r\nhistory of this nation. And his star will grow brighter as humanity\r\nbetter perfects its telescopes of perception. We love him for what he\r\nis.\r\n\r\n                                                          J. A. WAYLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Eugene V. Debs as an Orator\r\n\r\n                            _By Max Ehrmann_\r\n\r\n                                        TERRE HAUTE, IND., August, 1907.\r\n\r\nNo man in America has been more hated, and few have been so much loved\r\nas Eugene V. Debs. His name is known and his face is familiar where the\r\ncity of his birth was never heard of. His opinions are considered by men\r\nin high places as the countersign of bloodshed, anarchy and riot, and by\r\nmillions of others they are regarded as the beacon light that is to lead\r\nhumanity to a better life and a higher civilization. Whatever may be\r\nsaid of his philosophy, one thing is certain, that he has won a place in\r\nAmerican history as one of its greatest orators; and in my opinion,\r\nthere is not a man on the American platform today who is his equal. His\r\nis a new and different kind of oratory. He resorts to no tricks of\r\nrhetoric, no claptrap and stage effects, no empty pretense of deep\r\nemotion; but he stands frankly before his audiences and opens the\r\ndoorways of his mind and heart that seem ever to be overflowing with\r\nterrible invective or the sweet waters of human kindness.\r\n\r\nThis style is very different from that of such speakers as Senator\r\nBeveridge. Mr. Beveridge’s orations on occasions and in the Senate are\r\nfinished, modeled, filed and practiced. Intonation and gesture are\r\ncarefully arranged to fit the sentiment. It is a piece of good\r\nworkmanship. But the whole effect lacks sincerity. You feel that Mr.\r\nBeveridge is secretly using you for his personal ends. None of these\r\nelements enter the oratory of Mr. Debs, and his sincerity is almost\r\nterrible in its reality. You feel that he will tell you what he thinks\r\nregardless of consequence.\r\n\r\nThe first time I heard Mr. Debs was more than ten years ago, when I was\r\na student at Harvard. He was booked to lecture at Prospect Union,\r\nCambridge. This was shortly after the great Chicago strike; and a good\r\nmany Harvard students and some instructors came out to see the\r\n“monster.” Mr. Debs was late; but the audience waited. When he came\r\nthere was no applause. He began to speak, and for more than two hours he\r\nheld that audience as if riveted to the seats; and they who had come to\r\nscorn, hovered around him for more than an hour, and went away his\r\nfriends. It was more than half an hour before I could get to the\r\nspeaker’s stand and shake hands with him.\r\n\r\nThe night before that he had spoken to one of the largest audiences that\r\nhad ever crowded into Faneuil Hall, Boston. And so generously was his\r\nmessage received that, as Dr. John Clarke Ridpath afterwards told me, he\r\nfeared the audience would “tear him to pieces trying to shake his hand.”\r\nDr. Ridpath was at that time editor of the _Arena_ and believed then\r\nthat Mr. Debs was one of the most masterful orators that had ever been\r\nreared on American soil and that he had then already a secure place in\r\nAmerican history.\r\n\r\nThe next time I tried to hear Mr. Debs was in Denver. The crowd was so\r\ngreat that I could not get within fifty feet of the door of the largest\r\npublic hall in that city, and it was then said that up to that time\r\nthere had never been such an audience in that hall.\r\n\r\nI did, however, get to hear Mr. Debs the next Sunday, in the same city,\r\nwhere the day was celebrated as Debs-Day at Manhattan Beach Gardens—at\r\nthat time a prominent summer garden of Denver. He spoke in the theater,\r\nand after the speech an opera was given by the splendid stock company\r\nplaying there that summer. Everybody wore Debs badges and the day was\r\ngenerally observed in Denver as given to the great Socialist.\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Debs has gone on and on and spoken to more and larger audiences\r\nthan any other speaker except Mr. Bryan, until every great rostrum in\r\nAmerica has supported his tall figure, and the walls of every great\r\npublic hall have resounded his words.\r\n\r\nIn some ways our distinguished fellow-townsman has wandered a stranger\r\nin the city of his birth. Here we have been the last to acknowledge his\r\npower and influence. We see him often, recognize him as a quiet,\r\nrespected citizen, possessing those domestic virtues that all men and\r\nwomen admire; but the great Debs, the Debs who first arraigned the trust\r\nabuses in this country, who broke the first ground for the harvest of\r\nmodern popular reforms—that Debs we have never yet recognized, nor that\r\npower of his—whatever one may think of his doctrines—which is the type\r\nthat has made the names of men undying.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Lincoln, 1860—Debs, 1894\r\n\r\n                           _By John Swinton_\r\n\r\n                                              NEW YORK, September, 1895.\r\n\r\nWhen Eugene Victor Debs came to New York from Chicago last year he made\r\na speech in Cooper Union which I heard. I sat near a spot at which I had\r\nsat at another meeting held in the same place thirty-four years\r\npreviously, which was addressed by another speaker who came to New York\r\nfrom Chicago. The western speaker who stood on that platform in August,\r\n1894, was to me a reminder of the other western speaker who stood there\r\nin February, 1860. Both men were tall and spare in figure; the\r\ncomplexion of each rather dark—darker in the one than in the other; the\r\nface of each was rather gaunt, that of the earlier speaker much more\r\ngaunt than that of the latter; both were men of good and strong\r\nfeatures; there was something intense about the facial expression of\r\neach; both were men of commanding and impressive manners.\r\n\r\nI recall the somewhat peculiar and shrill voice of the speaker of 1860;\r\nI heard another voice in 1894 which resembled it. As they spoke, it was\r\neasy for a New Yorker to discern that they were both men of the west.\r\n\r\nThe man to whose speech I listened in Cooper Union in February, of 1860,\r\nwas Abraham Lincoln, of Illinois—born in Kentucky; the man who spoke\r\nfrom the same platform within my hearing last year was Eugene Victor\r\nDebs, of Illinois—born in Indiana.\r\n\r\nI recalled the appearance, the manner, the voice and the speech of\r\nLincoln as Debs stood before me thirty-four years afterwards.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me that both men were imbued with the same spirit. Both\r\nseemed to me as men of judgment, reason, earnestness and power. Both\r\nseemed to me as men of free, high, genuine, generous manhood. I “took”\r\nto Lincoln in my early life, as I took to Debs a third of a century\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nIn the speeches of both westerners there was cogent argument; there were\r\napt illustrations; there were especially emphatic passages; there were\r\nmoments of lightning; there were touches of humor, and there were other\r\nqualities which produce conviction or impel to action. Each speaker was\r\nas free as the other from gross eloquence. I confess that I was as much\r\nimpressed with the closing words of Debs’ speech as I was with those of\r\nLincoln, when he exclaimed, “Let us have faith that right makes might,\r\nand in that faith let us to the end dare to do our duty, as we\r\nunderstand it.”\r\n\r\nAs Lincoln stands in my memory while looking far back, Debs stands in it\r\nas I saw him in Cooper Union a year ago.\r\n\r\nLincoln spoke for man; so spoke Debs. Lincoln spoke for right and\r\nprogress; so spoke Debs. Lincoln spoke for the freedom of labor; so\r\nspoke Debs. Lincoln was the foe of human slavery; so is Debs.\r\n\r\nI was in the deepest sympathy with Lincoln when he came here, as I was\r\nalso with Debs when he came here. I had striven for Fremont in my youth,\r\nas I have striven in later years for principles that are the logical\r\nsequence of those of Lincoln and are represented by Debs.\r\n\r\nLet no admirer of Abraham Lincoln—I do not mean the apotheosized\r\nemancipator, but the Lincoln of 1860—offer objection to aught that has\r\nbeen here said. At the time I have spoken of Lincoln was regarded by\r\nmillions of people as a cross between a crank and a monster. In hundreds\r\nof papers and by hundreds of speakers he was called the “Illinois\r\nbaboon.” Every epithet that hate could invent was applied to him; every\r\nbase purpose that malice could conceive was imputed to him. To the\r\n“Satanic press” of New York Lincoln was an object of loathing and\r\nderision, a “nigger lover,” a clown, a subverter of the constitution and\r\nthe law; and above all, he was a blatant fool who would destroy that\r\nindestructible “system of labor” which had existed of old, which was\r\nupheld by the supreme court and the lynch law court, the church, the\r\narmy, the press and the capitalist, as also by congress—both houses.\r\nWhy, the Debs whom we have with us in our country today is a harmless\r\ncitizen compared with the Lincoln of 1860, as he had been described\r\nbefore he came to New York. It looks to me as though the newspaper\r\nslubberdegullions and plutocracy in our time had lost that power of\r\ncantankerous invective which was possessed by their contemporaries of\r\n1860, now mostly dead and forgotten. I have read some assaults upon\r\nDebs, but all of them were poorly done.\r\n\r\nLincoln’s name was less familiar to New York masses at the opening of\r\n1860 than Debs’ was in 1894. Lincoln had campaigned in the west, but the\r\nwest was much farther away then than it is now, and western men were\r\nless known in the east than they are now. Lincoln drew a crowd to Cooper\r\nUnion, but not as large a crowd as Debs drew.\r\n\r\nWell, when I heard Debs’ speech here I had half a notion that it might\r\nbe the prelude to an incident like that which followed Lincoln’s speech.\r\nThere were few people, at least in New York, who could have believed\r\nthat within three months from the day of Lincoln’s speech here, Lincoln\r\nwould be a candidate for the office of President of the United States.\r\n“Some say,” he said while in New York then, “some say they may make me\r\nVice-President with Seward.”\r\n\r\nIt was always the opinion of my old friend Raymond, the founder of the\r\n_New York Times_, whom I long served as chief of his editorial staff,\r\nthat it was the Cooper Union speech of Lincoln that made it possible for\r\nhim to be a candidate for the presidency, and that it was most potent in\r\nmaking him acceptable to the Republican party in the east. It certainly\r\nwas a factor of influence in the nomination in Chicago the following\r\nMay.\r\n\r\nNo matter about that now. When, in Cooper Union, a year ago, I heard the\r\nspeech of Eugene V. Debs, which, in so many ways reminded me of that of\r\nAbraham Lincoln long ago, I felt sure that nobody could deny that here\r\nagain, in this new western leader in the struggle for labor’s\r\nemancipation, there might be the stuff for a presidential candidate.\r\n\r\nAnd this suggestion would have been made by me at the New York meeting\r\nbut for the jam of perversity on the platform.\r\n\r\nDebs in Cooper Union reminded me of Lincoln there. As Lincoln, of\r\nIllinois, became an efficient agent for freedom, so, perchance might\r\nDebs, of Indiana, become in the impending conflict for the liberation of\r\nlabor. Let us never forget Lincoln’s great words, “Liberty before\r\nproperty; the man before the dollar.”\r\n\r\n\r\n               Eugene V. Debs, Incarnate Spirit of Revolt\r\n\r\n                       _John Spargo, June, 1908_\r\n\r\nTo be chosen standard bearer of the Socialist party in three successive\r\nelectoral campaigns is to receive a unique tribute. For the candidates\r\nof the Socialist movement are not chosen by a few bosses, free to reward\r\ntheir favorite servitors with honors, place and pelf: they are chosen by\r\nthe nearest approach to ideal democratic methods yet devised by any\r\npolitical party.\r\n\r\nNo man who had unworthily borne the Socialist banner in one campaign, or\r\nwho had disappointed the hopes of his comrades, could possibly be\r\nnominated a second time. One act of cowardice or dishonor would be\r\nenough to make the renomination of any man impossible, no matter how\r\ngifted he might be.\r\n\r\nDemos is a hard taskmaster. Some have said that Demos is ungrateful and\r\nunappreciative of loyal service. The annals of the Socialist movement\r\ncertainly furnish some support to the charge. And yet, though its\r\nappreciation is not shouted from housetops, nor symbolized by golden\r\ncrowns and hero-worship, those who have served longest and hardest in\r\nthe ranks know that service to the Cause of Liberty is not\r\nunappreciated; that love and faithful comradeship are showered upon the\r\ntrue and brave soldiers in the great army of Labor.\r\n\r\nNo man in America has done nobler service for the cause of Socialism\r\nthan Eugene V. Debs; no man has given more freely of his strength to\r\nkeep the altar fires of the Revolution bright. And no man has been more\r\nrichly and warmly loved than Debs has been. The love of his comrades has\r\nbeen his constant reward and inspiration.\r\n\r\nAnd Debs has given love for love. How much the outpouring of his love\r\nupon the hearts of his comrades has meant to the Socialist movement will\r\nnever be measured. To many a wearied fighter in the ranks his words of\r\ncheer, vibrant with love and appreciative sympathy, has been as a\r\ncooling draught from the deep fountains of life. To many a comrade\r\nwalking in the dark and silent places his strong handclasp has brought\r\nstrength and assurance. To many a soul swept from its moorings he has\r\ngiven the anchorage of a new faith. He has mingled his tears with the\r\ntears of many of his stricken comrades and borne upon his strong\r\nshoulders the burdens which bore too heavily upon them. Debs draws love\r\nfrom a million hearts as a well draws from showers and springs; and like\r\na well he gives it back to all who thirst for love as they cross the\r\ndesert of life.\r\n\r\nOur love for Eugene V. Debs, the greatest lover of us all, entered into\r\nour choice of him as the bearer of our standard, the scarlet banner of\r\nthe sacred cause, the symbol of a world-brotherhood to be. But it was\r\nnot our love alone. Into our choice there entered another element than\r\nour love for Debs, namely, our consciousness that he was splendidly\r\nequipped for the task, Nature and Destiny seemed to have joined to dower\r\nDebs with the qualities of mind and soul needed for the task we gave\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nInscrutable are the ways of Nature’s working, and we may not understand\r\nthe fashioning of a human life in her mysterious workshop. Was it a\r\nfather’s independence and pride which infused the son’s being with a\r\nrebel spirit? Was it the mother’s passion for beauty and freedom in life\r\nduring the long days and nights when her unborn son stirred within her\r\nwhich caused the boy so soon to seek the companionship of the flowers\r\nand the stars, to envy the freedom of the birds and to shudder at all\r\nthe ugly in life?\r\n\r\nTo such questions Science can give no answer. We only know that there\r\nwas such a child, worshipping beauty and loving freedom; hating ugliness\r\nand pain. And this we know only as we know the man. The man must have\r\nbeen in the boy.\r\n\r\nWe know that there can be no living Socialist movement in any country\r\nwhich is not a product of its own life and experience. The Socialist\r\nmovement is born anew out of the womb of capitalistic conditions in\r\nevery country. And as with the Socialist movement itself, so must it be\r\nwith the apostles of it’s faith. The greatest apostles of the\r\nemancipation must likewise be the products of the life and experience\r\nfrom which the movement springs. No amount of intellectual training can\r\ntake the place of that proletarian psychology which is expressed in the\r\nirresistible passion for liberty of that great red army whose tread\r\nonward shakes the world.\r\n\r\nThe psychology and passion of the proletariat are incarnated in Eugene\r\nV. Debs. Life, Fate, Destiny—call it what you will!—added to Nature’s\r\ncontribution the elements which made him the Genius of the Revolution.\r\nThe little comrade of the stars and the flowers grew to be the human\r\nembodiment of the Spirit of the revolt of the Disinherited and\r\nDespoiled, the living Voice of the Doomed and Damned.\r\n\r\nBut first of all he must suffer. To voice the cry of Labor he must first\r\nendure its agony; to speak the protest of the Doomed he must first\r\nendure the doom. Led by Destiny, he went the weary way of toil and\r\ntragedy, the way along which the dumb millions march in pain to their\r\nGolgotha. Each footfall tore his heartstrings; each fallen human wreck\r\nwoke in his soul a yearning to speak their curse to the driving Power he\r\ncould not see. Each human cry sank into his heart, each tortured curse\r\nhe nourished as his own.\r\n\r\nHe heard voices and saw visions. Voices called him to a service he could\r\nnot understand. As Joan of Arc listened to the unseen voices, so he\r\nlistened. But he understood not. They cried out to him, bidding him\r\nvoice the wrong. “Speak! Speak for the Dumb who cannot speak! Speak\r\ntheir protest! Speak their curse!”\r\n\r\nHe saw visions where other men saw only a black void. For him the\r\nblackness was peopled with tragic human shapes. He saw the Victims of\r\nthe Centuries. He saw Labor bound to wheels. He saw Hunger rob the\r\nCradle. He saw Death dance to the cries of Mocked Motherhood. And far\r\noff, like the Prisoner of Patmos, he saw a New Earth in which all human\r\nbeings were comrades of the flowers and the stars, and sharers of the\r\nfreedom of the birds.\r\n\r\nHe obeyed the voices. He spoke in the Assembly of the Law-makers—spoke\r\nfor Labor and against Labor’s wrongs. He spoke for the Dumb, for the\r\nDoomed and Damned. He spoke their protest and their curse. He spoke for\r\nChildhood and for Motherhood—spoke for the Makers of Laws. And when he\r\nspoke they answered with the howl of the Beast.\r\n\r\nBut Labor heard him speak its own Protest; heard him hurl at the Makers\r\nof Laws and the Masters of Bread the curse its heart had fashioned and\r\nits lips failed to speak. Labor knew that Debs voiced its own dumb agony\r\nand cheered him on by glad applause and by its love. But while he spoke\r\nthere was sadness in his heart, each speech was answered in his own soul\r\nby a sense of sadness and of shame. Perhaps it was vain to speak to the\r\nMakers of Laws and the Masters of Bread! Perhaps it was better to speak\r\nto the Slaves of Bread! Better to speak to Labor and to teach it speech!\r\n\r\nBut the new speech brought no heartease. Ever the sense of Failure\r\nshamed him and tore his soul. And yet the voices bade him speak. “Speak\r\nof the visions! Speak of the New Earth! Speak and lead the way!” they\r\ncried. And his tortured soul answered in agony: “I cannot show the way,\r\nfor I know it not!”\r\n\r\nThe Masters of Bread knew nothing of the struggle of his soul; they knew\r\nnot that his speech which woke their fears was but his whisper! They\r\ncould not know that the things their Fear and their Hate bade them do\r\nwould loosen his tongue and give it speech like thunder. In their\r\nignorance they forged a thunderbolt with which the barriers to the\r\npathway to the land of the vision would be shattered. They cast Debs\r\ninto prison. And in his prison cell Debs was to find Freedom—the Freedom\r\nof his Soul.\r\n\r\nWhen they prisoned Debs they unprisoned his soul. When they drew the\r\nbolts that pent his body in Woodstock jail they made Eugene V. Debs a\r\nfree man. In the silences of that prison cell his tongue was loosed and\r\nhis eyes saw the vision of the Comrade-world and the way by which it\r\nmust be reached. In the prison cell the Angel of Freedom touched his\r\nlips with fire from the altar and set him free to proclaim the\r\nRevolution. In their rage the Masters of Bread thought that they could\r\nsilence Debs, but instead they broke the only fetter upon his soul and\r\nupon his speech.\r\n\r\nThus was Debs trained to be our standard bearer. Thus did he become the\r\nVoice of the Revolution whose call to Labor was destined to shake the\r\nhemisphere. He bore the people’s banner as one marked for the mission by\r\nInexorable Destiny. He bore it proudly, nobly, wherever the fight was\r\nfiercest, and when he shouted the battle cry of Socialism it echoed\r\nthrough the land from sea to sea, from snow-capped mountain and deepest\r\nvalley. And Labor heard the battle cry and answered in speech both clear\r\nand strong. And when he took the banner and went forth a second time,\r\nlouder and stronger grew the answering cry, so that the Masters of Bread\r\ntrembled in their seats of power and privilege.\r\n\r\nAnd now, once more, speeded by the love of fifty thousand comrades in\r\nthe organized movement, and by half a million in the larger army, Debs\r\ngoes forth bearing the banner and proclaiming the message of Socialism.\r\nOnce more he goes forth to voice the cry of the Disinherited, the curse\r\nof the Doomed and Damned. Once more the Incarnate Spirit of the\r\nRevolution goes forth to point men to the Vision of a world rich with\r\nthe glory of comradeship, throbbing with the joy of freedom, radiant\r\nwith love—the New Earth, resonant with the mingled songs of free and\r\nhappy human beings; resplendent with the beauty of unfettered life.\r\n\r\nAnd a million workingmen will answer with their cheers and pledge their\r\nfaith with their votes!\r\n\r\n\r\n                          A Companion to Truth\r\n\r\n                           _By Robert Hunter_\r\n\r\nI remember as a little lad of eight or nine years, walking with my\r\nfather in one of the streets of Terre Haute. A tall, slender, handsome\r\nyoung man stopped to talk with my father. At first I was fascinated by\r\nthe way they grasped hands and looked into each other’s eyes. I was then\r\nimpressed by their animated conversation. But they talked on and on\r\nuntil it seemed to me hours in length; and finally I began to tug at my\r\nfather’s coat-tails, urging him to come on. After a while they parted,\r\nand my father said to me very seriously, “You should not interrupt me,\r\nRobert, when I am talking. That young man is one of the greatest souls\r\nof this earth, and you should have listened to what he said.”\r\n\r\nFrom time to time afterwards I heard of ’Gene, and many were the stories\r\ntold of him. Everyone spoke of his friendship for the poor. He could\r\nnever keep money in his pocket. His wife says he always gives away his\r\nclothes to those who come to his door; and he gives his best suits,\r\nnever his old ones.\r\n\r\nOnce I was told he had a gold watch of considerable value which had been\r\ngiven to him, and a fireman who had been out of work for some time\r\nstopped him to say that he had a job offered on the railroad, but he\r\nwould have to have a watch before he could go to work. Immediately ’Gene\r\ntook out his gold watch and give it to the man, telling him to return it\r\nwhen he was able to buy one for himself.\r\n\r\nThese and countless other stories are told by his fellow-citizens. Many\r\nof them do not understand ’Gene. His views and his work they cannot\r\ncomprehend, but every man, woman and child in that town loves him with a\r\ndevotion quite extraordinary.\r\n\r\nThey say that a prophet is without honor in his own country, but in\r\nTerre Haute you will find that however much they misunderstand the work\r\nthat ’Gene is doing there is not one who does not honor and love him.\r\n\r\nAsk anyone. Go to the poor, the vagrant, the hobo. Go to the churches,\r\nto the rich, to the banker, to the traction magnate. You will find that\r\nevery single one will say that ’Gene has something which other men do\r\nnot possess. Some will say he is rash, unwise, and too radical. Others\r\nwill say that he is too good for this world, and that his visions and\r\ndreams are the fanciful outpourings of a generous but impractical soul.\r\nBut ask them about his character, his honesty, his sincerity, and\r\nunconsciously many of them will remove their hats.\r\n\r\nSome of these statements will seem an exaggeration. But one cannot avoid\r\nthat in speaking of ’Gene. When one who knows him makes any statement,\r\nno matter how moderate, it will seem to others who do not know him an\r\nexaggeration.\r\n\r\n’Gene has followed Truth wherever she has led. He does not ask what is\r\npolitic, what is wise, what is expedient; he only asks what is truth. He\r\nloves Truth beyond all things. She is his absolute mistress, and he has\r\ngone with her from riches to poverty, from popularity to unpopularity.\r\nHe has gone with her out of great positions into small positions. He has\r\nstood up for her against all men. For her he has seemed at times to\r\nsacrifice all earthly gain, and to accept without one pang of regret\r\nmisunderstanding, misrepresentation, and almost universal condemnation.\r\nFor her he has been momentarily one of the most popular men in the\r\ncountry, and for her he has been momentarily one of the most unpopular\r\nmen in the country. He has been her companion when everyone believed in\r\nher, and he has been her companion when to believe in her meant to go\r\ninto prison stripes, behind iron bars.\r\n\r\nSometimes I have differed with ’Gene. I have said to him that what he\r\nwas doing was unwise, impolitic, dangerous. At such times, under such\r\ncriticism, he is always kindly but undeterred; and it is his conscience\r\nthat answers you back and asks, “But is it right? Is it true?”\r\n\r\nShortly after I left college I went to live in one of the most\r\npoverty-stricken districts of Chicago. One Sunday it was announced that\r\nEugene would come there to speak. Thousands came to hear him, and\r\noverflowing the hall a multitude waited outside to hear him speak from a\r\ntruck. After waiting for two hours perhaps, ’Gene came out and began to\r\nspeak. Most of the audience were foreigners who could hardly understand\r\na word of English, and as I heard his beautiful words and saw their\r\nwistful, earnest faces I felt that something more powerful, penetrating\r\nand articulate than mere words was passing between the audience and the\r\nspeaker. For a moment it seemed to me that a soul was speaking from the\r\neyes and frame of ’Gene, and that, regardless of differences of language\r\nand all the traditional barriers that separated him from the multitude\r\nabout him, they understood and believed all he said. I remember how my\r\nheart beat, and how tears began to flow from my boyish eyes. I was\r\nashamed for fear someone would see me. And it was not because of\r\nanything that ’Gene was saying. It was solely because of something back\r\nof the man, something greater than the man, something bigger, more\r\npowerful, and more moving than any words or expression. And after the\r\nthing was over I went to him, helped him on with his coat, and fondled\r\nhim as I would my own father or brother. And as we went away together\r\nthere kept coming into my heart the words of Ruth:\r\n\r\n“Entreat me not to leave thee or to return from following after thee.\r\nFor whither thou goest I will go, and whither thou lodgest I will lodge.\r\nThy people shall be my people, and thy God my God.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Greater Love Hath No Man\r\n\r\nTo me the name of Eugene V. Debs means this—loyalty absolute,\r\nunswerving, incorruptible to the Cause of Labor, the Cause of Humanity\r\nitself. Where that Cause is at stake, Debs sinks his personality with\r\nutter self-abnegation; he fears nothing, he dares all in defense of that\r\nsplendid ideal. No threat deters him; nor is there gold enough in all\r\nthe swollen purses of Plutocracy to turn this man one hair’s-breadth\r\naside from his fidelity to Labor. Greater love than his hath no man. All\r\nhonor to ’Gene Debs, say I.—GEORGE ALLAN ENGLAND, Bryant’s Pond, Maine.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Agitator and Poet\r\n\r\nEugene V. Debs is an agitator with the heart of a poet. The combination\r\nis rare, and Socialism in America is to be congratulated on having a\r\nleader of his caliber. I think of Debs as preëminently the voice of the\r\nworking class. The proletarian spirit has found in him its loyalest and\r\nbravest exponent. But he is much more than that. He is a dreamer as well\r\nas a fighter. He leads men because he _loves_ them. If Walt Whitman\r\ncould return, he would surely recognize in Debs a man who believes with\r\nall the intensity of his nature in “the dear love of comrades.”\r\n\r\n                                                      LEONARD D. ABBOTT.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   A Love Shared by Lincoln and Debs\r\n\r\nForty-six years ago the hand of the martyred LINCOLN rested gently upon\r\nthe head of a child, who looked into the rugged, kindly face made\r\nbeautiful by the divinity of the SAVIOR OF THE SLAVE, and gave instant\r\nand unquestioning love to the MAN “with charity for all.” Time came when\r\nthe boy, with crepe on his arm and the ache of childhood in his throat,\r\nwatched the sad and solemn pageant for the Nation’s dearest dead.\r\n\r\nFifteen years ago EUGENE VICTOR DEBS stretched out two generous hands\r\nand “the warmest heart that ever beat,” to clasp as his own the hands\r\nand heart of a man that loved, trusted and honored him at first sight.\r\n\r\nAnd in the close intimacy of our brother-comrade-hood I have found no\r\nfault in GENE; for he is as faithful and tender as my dear old Mother,\r\nwho loves him, blessed him and bade him kiss her, as brave as a lion, as\r\ngentle as a woman, as honest and straightforward as a little child, as\r\nwhite, clean and sweet of soul as his elder brothers, LINCOLN and\r\nCHRIST—and these three are Nature’s noblest noblemen.\r\n\r\n                  W. E. P. FRENCH, U. S. Army.\r\n\r\n                  Cornwall-on-Hudson, New York, Saturday, June 27, 1908.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       A Righteous Cause Must Win\r\n\r\nIf I were keenly ambitious for the future acclaim of my countrymen I\r\nwould rather lead the Socialist party to defeat in the campaign of 1908\r\nthan to win as the candidate either of the Republican or Democratic\r\nparties. Taft and Bryan look forward only to the power and the doubtful\r\nhonor of dispensing patronage. Both stand on platforms which are barren\r\nof promise or hope. With all the world pressing on to the solution of\r\ngreat social and economic questions we are confronted with the\r\nlamentable spectacle of the dominant political parties of the United\r\nStates beating a cowardly retreat, and we see their candidates rival one\r\nanother in the timidity of their assaults on obvious and admitted\r\nwrongs.\r\n\r\nThere is no higher honor than that bequeathed with the leadership of a\r\ngreat moral principle. Socialism is the greatest moral principle yet\r\ndiscovered by humanity. It can be put into effect only by education and\r\npolitical action, and the Socialists of the United States have in three\r\ncampaigns entrusted the leadership to Eugene V. Debs. In coming years,\r\nwhen some future leader will sweep the field, and when no voice will be\r\nraised against the fundamental equity and practicability of Socialism,\r\nthe historian will dwell on the pioneer work of the men and women who\r\nplaced Eugene V. Debs at their head, and the verdict of the historian\r\nwill be far different from that of the thoughtless critics of today.\r\n\r\nA righteous cause always wins in the end, and there is imperishable\r\nglory for those who stand at the front in the years when men’s eyes are\r\nblinded to the truth. No man is great enough as a Socialist to make\r\nhimself greater than his party. Bryan looms great because the Democratic\r\nparty is a dull level of ignorant mediocrity; Taft is looked up to\r\nbecause of the belief that the great monied interests have accepted his\r\nleadership and will bring about his election; Eugene V. Debs is simply\r\nthe unselfish representative of an idea which will prevail despite all\r\nwhich can be arrayed against it.\r\n\r\n                                               FREDERICK UPHAM ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                               Hastings-on-Hudson, N. Y.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Love’s Inter-Racial Pan-Human Language\r\n\r\nIn January, 1897, Debs joined the international Socialist movement.\r\n\r\nSix weeks later the present writer, amid the jeers and gibes and some\r\nhisses of many old comrades, publicly hailed our Gene’s adhesion to the\r\nranks as symbolizing the Awakening of Labor.\r\n\r\nAfter awhile the S. D. A. was founded, and I met Debs in this city as a\r\nmember of the new party.\r\n\r\nOn that occasion he addressed an audience including hundreds of my\r\ncountrymen. They hardly understood one word out of every five he spoke,\r\nbut they nevertheless clearly grasped the meaning of his message as a\r\nwhole, which they applauded to the echo.\r\n\r\nWell, it was Love’s inter-racial, pan-human language which had reached\r\nthe hearts almost unaided by the use of words.\r\n\r\nAnd ever since then they, like myself, have loved him as their big\r\nbrother, their comrade, the foremost champion of their great Cause.\r\n\r\n                                                          M. WINCHEVSKY.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Sincere to the Core\r\n\r\nEugene V. Debs! This is one of the great names of the century. No\r\none—not even a political enemy—has ever said that Debs is not sincere to\r\nthe core of his heart. It is an event to meet this courageous friend of\r\nman. The grasp of his hand is comforting, the look of his lighted face\r\nis an inspiration. In that one look you are taken into the door of his\r\nhome, seated at his table, warmed at his chimney-fire!\r\n\r\n                                                          EDWIN MARKHAM.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  Illustration page 13.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  Portrait page 61.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  Illustration page 194.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  Illustration page 200.\r\n\r\nFootnote 5:\r\n\r\n  Portrait page 45.\r\n\r\nFootnote 6:\r\n\r\n  Portrait page 93.\r\n\r\nFootnote 7:\r\n\r\n  Illustration page 109.\r\n\r\nFootnote 8:\r\n\r\n  Illustration page 125.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n 1.
