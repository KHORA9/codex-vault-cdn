In such a case,\r\neverything depends on the ability of the generals who command the\r\ndifferent army corps, who, operating in remote parts of the field, must\r\ntake the responsibility of success or failure. The two Canadas were so\r\nfar removed from New Brunswick, and the means of communication were so\r\npoor, that there was but little help, even in the way of suggestion, to\r\nbe expected from them, while the contest for responsible government was\r\nbeing carried on. Even the efforts in the same direction which were\r\nbeing made in the province of Nova Scotia had but little influence on\r\nthe course of events in New Brunswick, for each province had its own\r\nparticular grievances and its own separate interests. Thus it happened\r\nthat the battle for responsible government in New Brunswick was fought,\r\nto a large extent, without reference to what was being done in the\r\nother provinces which now form the Dominion of Canada, and the leaders\r\nof the movement had to be guided by the peculiar local circumstances of\r\nthe situation. Still, there is no doubt that the efforts of all the\r\nprovinces, directed to the same ends, were mutually helpful and made the\r\nvictory more easily won.\r\n\r\nAmong the men who took a part in the contest for responsible government\r\nin New Brunswick, Lemuel Allan Wilmot undoubtedly held the foremost\r\nplace, not only by reason of the ability with which he advocated the\r\ncause, but from the trust which the people had in him, which made him a\r\nnatural leader and the proper exponent of their views. There were,\r\nindeed, men working in the same field before his time, but it was his\r\nhappy fortune to witness the fruit of his labours to give the province a\r\nbetter form of government, and to bring its constitution into line with\r\nthe system which prevailed in the mother country. He not only viewed the\r\nland of promise from afar, but he entered into it, and he became the\r\nfirst native lieutenant-governor of the province,--a result which even\r\nhe, sanguine as he was, could hardly have contemplated when he began his\r\ncareer as a public man.\r\n\r\n{THE WILMOT FAMILY}\r\n\r\nLemuel Allan Wilmot was born in the county of Sunbury, on the banks of\r\nthe St. John River, on January 31st, 1809. He was the son of William\r\nWilmot, a respectable merchant and lumberman, who was in partnership\r\nwith William Peters, grandfather of Sir Leonard Tilley. William Wilmot\r\nwas the son of Lemuel Wilmot, a Loyalist, who was a resident of\r\nPoughkeepsie, New York, at the beginning of the Revolution. He (Lemuel)\r\nraised a company of soldiers for the service of the king, and became a\r\ncaptain in the Loyal American Regiment which was commanded by Beverley\r\nRobinson, serving in that corps during the war. At the peace, he came to\r\nNew Brunswick and settled in Sunbury County on the river St. John. The\r\nWilmots were a respectable English family, and the first of the name in\r\nAmerica was Benjamin Wilmot, who was born in England in 1589 and came to\r\nAmerica with his wife Ann, probably prior to 1640. He was one of the\r\nearly settlers of New Haven, Connecticut, and the records of that colony\r\nshow that he took the oaths of fidelity at a court held on May 2d, 1648.\r\nHe died in 1669. His son William, who was born in 1632, was probably\r\nalso a native of England. He married Sarah Thomas in 1658, and died in\r\n1689.\r\n\r\nThomas Wilmot, his son, was born in 1679. He married Mary Lines, and\r\ntheir son Ezekiel was born in 1708. Ezekiel Wilmot and his wife Beulah\r\nwere the parents of Lemuel, who was born in 1743. Lemuel Wilmot married\r\nElizabeth Street, and William, the father of the subject of this\r\nbiography, was their son. William Wilmot married Hannah Bliss, a\r\ndaughter of the Hon. Daniel Bliss, a Massachusetts Loyalist, who became\r\na member of the council of New Brunswick and was the father of John\r\nMurray Bliss, one of the judges of the supreme court of that province.\r\nHis grandfather was Colonel John Murray, a Massachusetts Loyalist, who\r\nwas for many years a member of the general court of that colony and who\r\nbecame a mandamus councillor. It will thus be seen that Lemuel Wilmot\r\ncame from the best New England stock, and that his connections were\r\nhighly respectable and even distinguished. He was proud of his New\r\nEngland descent, and claimed the usual ancestor from among the\r\npassengers of the _Mayflower_ who landed at Plymouth in 1620. If this\r\nclaim is correct, his descent from the Pilgrim Fathers must have been\r\nthrough the female line, and no record of it has been preserved. The\r\nmatter is not of much consequence at the present day, for the Wilmots\r\nhave made a record in their province far more distinguished than that\r\nwhich they won in New England, for they have given to New Brunswick five\r\nmembers of the legislature, a senator and member of the House of Commons\r\nof Canada, two members of the executive of New Brunswick, and one of the\r\nprivy council of Canada, an attorney-general and a provincial secretary\r\nof New Brunswick and two lieutenant-governors.\r\n\r\n{LIEUTENANT-GOVERNOR CARLETON}\r\n\r\nThe system of government which existed in all the British North American\r\ncolonies at the time when L. A. Wilmot was born was practically the\r\nsame. New Brunswick had been separated from Nova Scotia in 1784, and, in\r\nthe autumn of that year, its first governor was sent out in the person\r\nof Thomas Carleton, a brother of Sir Guy Carleton. Thomas Carleton had\r\nbeen an officer in one of the regiments which fought during the War of\r\nthe Revolution, but he was in no way distinguished, and had no special\r\nqualifications for the position he was called upon to fill. That fact,\r\nhowever, did not concern the persons in England who appointed him. In\r\nthose days, fitness or ability had very little to do with colonial\r\nappointments. Carleton continued to fill the office of governor and\r\nlieutenant-governor until his death in 1817; but for the last fourteen\r\nyears of his term he resided in England, and the duties of his office\r\nwere performed by a succession of administrators under the name of\r\npresidents. To assist him in his deliberations, Carleton had a council\r\nof twelve members, who were appointed by the Crown and were therefore\r\nwholly under the influence of the governor and the authorities in\r\nEngland. In 1809, its number had been reduced to ten, and it was\r\ncomposed of the four judges of the supreme court, the provincial\r\nsecretary and the surveyor-general, who held their offices for life, and\r\nfour other persons. This council, in addition to its executive\r\nfunctions, also sat as the upper branch of the legislature, and, besides\r\nbeing wholly irresponsible except to the governor, it sat with closed\r\ndoors, so that the public had no opportunity of knowing what was being\r\ndone. It was not until the year 1833 that any portion of the journals of\r\nthe legislative council was published.\r\n\r\nThe House of Assembly consisted of members chosen by the freeholders of\r\nthe several counties and the freeholders and freemen of the city of St.\r\nJohn. This House was able to exert but a limited influence on the\r\ngovernment of the country, for all authority was vested in the\r\nlieutenant-governor and he was able to act in a manner quite independent\r\nof the legislature. All the appointments to office were in his hands,\r\nand they were made in many cases even without the knowledge of his\r\ncouncil. In England, even under the most despotic kings, parliament was\r\nalways able to curb the power of the Crown by refusing to grant\r\nsupplies; but this check did not exist in New Brunswick, or in the other\r\ncolonies of British North America at that time, because the governor had\r\nsources of revenue quite independent of the legislature. The British\r\ngovernment maintained a customs establishment in the colonies, which\r\nlevied duties on all merchandise imported, and over which the\r\nlegislature had no control. The British government also retained the\r\nrevenues arising from the Crown lands of the province, and these\r\nrevenues the governor expended as he pleased. The House of Assembly,\r\ntherefore, might refuse to vote supplies; but the governor could go on\r\nwithout them, and the only effect of such a procedure was to injure its\r\nown officials, and to deprive the people of the money which was expended\r\non roads and bridges.\r\n\r\n{THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND}\r\n\r\nAnother feature of the system of government in New Brunswick was the\r\npredominant influence it gave to the members of the Church of England.\r\nEvery member of the council of the province belonged to that\r\ndenomination, and it was not until the year 1817 that any person who was\r\nnot an adherent of the Church of England was appointed to the council.\r\nThis exception was William Pagan, a member of the Church of Scotland,\r\nand his was a solitary instance because up to the year 1833, when the\r\nold council was abolished, all its other members were adherents of the\r\nChurch of England. The same rule prevailed with respect to all the great\r\noffices in the gift of the Crown. All the judges of the supreme court\r\nfor the first sixty-seven years of the existence of the province were\r\nmembers of the Church of England. L. A. Wilmot, who became\r\nattorney-general in 1848, was the first person not a member of the\r\nChurch of England who filled that office, and he was the first judge not\r\na member of that Church who sat on the bench of New Brunswick.\r\n\r\nFor some time after the foundation of the province, the salaries of the\r\nChurch of England clergymen were paid by the British government, and\r\nlarge grants of land were made for the purpose of supporting the\r\nchurches. In addition to this, financial assistance was given to them\r\nin erecting their places of worship. No dissenting minister was allowed\r\nto perform the marriage ceremony, that privilege being confined to\r\nclergymen of the Church of England, the Church of Scotland, the Quakers\r\nand the Church of Rome. This was felt to be a very serious grievance,\r\nand, needless to say, produced a great deal of inconvenience.\r\n\r\nAnother grievance was the fact that the great offices were held by\r\nmembers of certain favoured families. These families, from their social\r\nposition and in some cases from their wealth, had the ear of the\r\ngovernor, or of the authorities in England, and were able to obtain and\r\nhold all the valuable places. The two Odells, father and son, held the\r\noffice of provincial secretary for sixty years. The Chipmans were\r\nanother favoured family, both the father and son being successively\r\njudges of the supreme court, and the former receiving large sums from\r\nthe British government as one of the commissioners who settled the\r\nboundary between Maine and New Brunswick. One of the greatest offices in\r\nthe province--that of the surveyor-general--was held by one person for\r\nthirty-three years, and this individual was in no sense responsible to\r\nany authority in New Brunswick except the governor. Those in power at\r\nthat day were very fond of expatiating on the glories of the British\r\nconstitution and the privileges the people enjoyed under it. But nothing\r\nless like the British constitution can be imagined than the system\r\nwhich then prevailed in the British North American colonies.\r\n\r\n{THE OFFICIAL CLASSES}\r\n\r\nOne feature which is not to be lost sight of in considering the\r\npolitical condition of the province at that time is the social element.\r\nThe distinctions between the upper classes and others was then far more\r\nmarked than it is at present. The officials and the professional men\r\nformed a class by themselves, and looked with contempt upon those who\r\nwere engaged in business. The salaries of the government officials were\r\nthen three or four times as large as they are at present, and they kept\r\nup a corresponding degree of state which others were not in a position\r\nto imitate. This assumption of superiority was carried out in all the\r\nrelations of life, and the sons of those who occupied an inferior\r\nstation were made to feel their position keenly. This was the case with\r\nLemuel Allan Wilmot, for, although his family was as good as any in the\r\nprovinces, he was the son of a man who was engaged in business and who\r\nwas not only a Dissenter but was actually a preacher in the denomination\r\nto which he belonged. No doubt the insults which the son received from\r\nthose who claimed to occupy a higher station had a good deal to do with\r\nhis zeal for the cause of Reform, and influenced his future career to a\r\nconsiderable extent.\r\n\r\nWilliam Wilmot, although he afterwards failed in business, was in\r\nprosperous circumstances when his son Lemuel was born. He was a Baptist\r\nand was one of the original members of the Baptist Church at Canning,\r\nin Queens County, which was founded in 1800. On Christmas Day, 1813,\r\nWilliam Wilmot and nine others received their dismissal from the Canning\r\nChurch for the purpose of founding a Baptist Church in Fredericton.\r\nWilmot was a local preacher and used his gift of eloquence in that way.\r\nHe also aspired to legislative distinction, and was elected a member of\r\nthe House of Assembly for the county of Sunbury in 1816. He was an\r\nunsuccessful candidate for the same seat in 1819, and again in 1820. At\r\nthe general election of 1827 he ran for the county of York, to which he\r\nhad removed several years before, but was again defeated. This was his\r\nlast attempt to become a member of the House of Assembly. His loss of\r\nthree elections out of four had certainly been discouraging, and was in\r\nsingular contrast to the fortune of his distinguished son, who never\r\nexperienced a defeat.\r\n\r\n{AS A LAW STUDENT}\r\n\r\nLemuel Wilmot's mother died when he was only eighteen months old, so\r\nthat he never knew a mother's love or a mother's care. But his father\r\nearly recognized his youthful promise, and gave him all the educational\r\nadvantages then available. He became a pupil at the College of New\r\nBrunswick, which was situated in Fredericton, of which the Rev. Dr.\r\nSomerville was the president and sole professor. This college was in\r\nfact merely a grammar school, but Wilmot acquired there some knowledge\r\nof the classics. However, his scholastic career was not prolonged, for\r\nin June, 1825, he entered as a student-at-law with Charles S. Putnam, a\r\nleading barrister of Fredericton. He was admitted an attorney of the\r\nsupreme court in July, 1830, and a barrister two years later. He was\r\nthen twenty-three years of age.\r\n\r\nThe men who were contemporaries of Mr. Wilmot as a youth are all dead,\r\nand not many anecdotes of his career as a student have been handed down\r\nto us. Being of an ardent and ambitious disposition, he took a keen\r\ninterest in the stirring events that were being enacted around him; for\r\nit was a time of great political excitement, and the business troubles\r\nof the province increased the difficulties of its inhabitants. In 1825,\r\nall the lumbermen in the province were ruined, and the bad management of\r\nthe Crown lands office which had added to the business difficulties\r\nbecame more than a political question, for by cramping its leading\r\nindustry it affected the prosperity of every man in New Brunswick. It\r\nwas then that young Wilmot resolved to enter upon a political career and\r\nto do what he could to redress the wrongs from which the people were\r\nsuffering. Strange to say, at this time he, who afterwards became most\r\neloquent, had an impediment in his speech, which it took much labour to\r\novercome. To improve his knowledge of French, he spent some months with\r\na French family in Madawaska, among the descendants of the ancient\r\nAcadians. In this way he acquired a colloquial knowledge of that\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nWilmot's ambition was to become a public man and to assist in the\r\nreformation of the constitution of his native province. He enjoyed many\r\nadvantages for the rôle he had undertaken. He was tall, his height being\r\nupwards of six feet, well proportioned, handsome and striking in his\r\nfeatures, and he possessed a voice of great strength and sweetness. He\r\nwas proficient in all athletic exercises, and took an interest in all\r\nthose movements which commend themselves to young men of enterprise and\r\nforce of character. He was a lieutenant in the first battalion of the\r\nYork County Militia when he was only eighteen years of age, and his\r\ndevotion to the militia force continued until the end of his life.\r\nPossessed as he was of all the elements which make men popular and\r\nprominent, he was early marked for advancement in the field that he had\r\nchosen for the exercise of his talents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nEARLY EFFORTS FOR REFORM\r\n\r\n\r\nThe agitation for an improvement in the constitution of New Brunswick\r\nbegan long before L. A. Wilmot was born. The first man who took a\r\nprominent stand for reform in the legislature was Mr. James Glenie, a\r\nmember for the county of Sunbury from 1792 to 1809. Mr. Glenie, who was\r\na Scotchman and a man of much ability, had been an officer in the Royal\r\nEngineers during the Revolutionary War. His efforts to obtain reforms\r\nwere met by the friends of the governor, Mr. Carleton, with the most\r\nviolent opposition. He was denounced as an incendiary, and indeed there\r\nwas hardly a limit to the fierceness with which he was attacked for\r\nattempting to bring about an improvement in the system of government.\r\nThe old Family Compact and their friends were ever ready to tell the\r\npublic how loyal they were, and to denounce as a traitor any person who\r\npresumed to object to the existing state of things. Mr. Glenie was not\r\nable to effect anything substantial for the improvement of the\r\nconstitution, because the time was not ripe for the changes he proposed.\r\nEngland itself was suffering at that time from a relapse from true\r\nconstitutional methods, so it was not to be expected that much\r\nattention would be paid to complaints which came from a remote province\r\nof North America.\r\n\r\nThe cause of Reform would not have been nearly so well supported as it\r\nwas, had it not been for the fact that the abuses which existed touched\r\nthe self-interest of many persons who were by no means Reformers at\r\nheart, and who in fact cared nothing about responsible government. The\r\nfirst successful attack which was made on the existing order of things\r\nwas with regard to the fees charged on land grants. These fees went to\r\nthe various officials, including the governor, and it was shown that on\r\na lot of land not exceeding three hundred acres, the enormous sum of\r\nforty-seven dollars was charged as fees, while on a lot of one thousand\r\nacres to ten grantees, the fees amounted to about two hundred dollars.\r\nThe reader will be able to understand from these figures how it was that\r\nthe officials of the government were able to live in such princely\r\nstyle. This evil was remedied by permission being obtained from the\r\ncolonial secretary to include a large number of grantees in one grant.\r\n\r\n{THE MARRIAGE QUESTION}\r\n\r\nAnother grievance which was attacked long before Mr. Wilmot entered\r\npublic life was the law which related to the performance of the marriage\r\nceremony. At that time the only clerical persons authorized to solemnize\r\nmarriages were the clergymen of the Church of England, ministers of the\r\nKirk of Scotland, Quakers, and priests of the Roman Catholic Church.\r\nThis was felt to be an intolerable grievance, because it prevented\r\nMethodists, Baptists and all Presbyterians except those connected with\r\nthe Church of Scotland from being married by their own ministers. In\r\n1821 a bill was passed in the House of Assembly authorizing all\r\nministers of the Gospel to solemnize marriages. This was rejected by the\r\ncouncil, a fate which befell many subsequent bills of the same kind. For\r\nseveral years the House of Assembly continued to pass the Dissenters'\r\nMarriage Bill, and the council as steadily rejected it. Finally, in\r\n1831, the House of Assembly concluded that nothing would serve to bring\r\nabout the reform asked for but a petition to the king, and accordingly a\r\npetition was prepared in which the facts were set forth and His Majesty\r\nwas asked to give instructions to the administrator of the government to\r\nrecommend the legislature to pass a bill extending the privilege of\r\nsolemnizing marriages to all regularly ordained clergymen of dissenting\r\ncongregations in New Brunswick. In 1832, a bill was passed by both\r\nHouses carrying out these views. It contained a suspending clause,\r\nhowever, which prevented it from going into operation until approved by\r\nHis Majesty. It was thought that this would settle the question, but in\r\n1834 a despatch was received from His Majesty's secretary of state for\r\nthe colonies in which it was announced that the royal assent had been\r\nwithheld on the ground that the Act was confined in its operation to\r\nfour denominations of Christians,--the Wesleyan Methodists, the\r\nBaptists, the Presbyterian seceders from the Church of Scotland, and the\r\nIndependents. It appeared, therefore, that the Act had been disallowed\r\nbecause it was not liberal enough, but this defect was speedily remedied\r\nby the passage of another bill during the session of 1834 in the terms\r\nsuggested by the colonial secretary, and the Dissenters' Marriage\r\nQuestion was thus settled.\r\n\r\n{IMPERIAL CUSTOM DUTIES}\r\n\r\nIt has already been stated that the British government continued to\r\nmaintain a custom-house establishment in New Brunswick, and to impose\r\nduties on goods imported into the province. These duties, which were\r\nlevied for the regulation of trade, were disposed of by the British\r\ngovernment and by the lieutenant-governor of the province with little\r\nreference to the wishes of the legislature. The old restrictive system\r\nwhich placed shackles on trade was modified by two Acts passed by the\r\nimperial parliament in 1822, under which the importation of provisions,\r\nlumber, cattle, tobacco and other articles from any foreign country in\r\nNorth and South America and the West Indies, into ports of British North\r\nAmerica and the British West Indies, was allowed under a fixed scale of\r\nduty, and a free export was allowed to goods going from all our ports to\r\nthese countries. The importation of the productions of foreign countries\r\nin Europe into the ports of British North America was also permitted,\r\nand a schedule of duties annexed. Under these Acts it was provided that\r\nthe duties on both imports and exports were to be collected by the\r\nimperial officers of customs, and the net revenue thus obtained was to\r\nbe placed at the disposal of the colonial treasuries. This arrangement\r\nwas a decided gain to New Brunswick, because, for the first time, it\r\nplaced nearly all the revenue collected by the imperial officers under\r\nthe control of the legislature.\r\n\r\nThe Acts of the imperial parliament, 6th George IV, Chapters 73 and 114,\r\nwent still farther in the way of removing restrictions from colonial\r\ntrade. These Acts provided that the duties imposed under them should be\r\npaid by the collector of customs into the hands of the treasurer or\r\nreceiver-general of the colony, to be applied to such uses as were\r\ndirected by the local legislature of such colony, exception being made\r\nin regard to the produce of duties payable to His Majesty, under any Act\r\npassed prior to the eighteenth year of his late Majesty, George III.\r\nThis exception is important for the purpose of illustrating the\r\npernicious system under which duties had been collected. Even so late as\r\nthe year 1833, Messrs. Simonds and Chandler, the New Brunswick delegates\r\nto the imperial government, were complaining that duties were collected\r\nat the several custom-houses in New Brunswick upon wine, molasses,\r\ncoffee and pimento under the provisions of the Acts of parliament, 6th\r\nGeorge II, Chapter 13; 4th George III, Chapter 15, and 6th George III,\r\nChapter 52, amounting to upwards of one thousand pounds sterling\r\nannually, which duties were not accounted for to the legislature, and\r\nthat it was not known to the House of Assembly by whom and to what\r\npurpose these duties were applied. The reply to this on the part of the\r\nimperial government was, that in pursuance of the directions contained\r\nin the statutes themselves, the duties levied under them were remitted\r\nto the exchequer in England in aid of the expenses incurred for the\r\ndefence of the British colonies in North America. Thus ten years after\r\nthe British government had undertaken to remit the duties collected in\r\nthe colonies to the exchequers of the colonies in which the money was\r\ncollected, there still remained a considerable revenue, obtained under\r\nold and obscure Acts of parliament, which was held back, and the\r\ndestination of which was not known, until disclosed to the delegates\r\nsent to England to obtain the redress of New Brunswick's grievances.\r\n\r\nBut the grievance which caused the greatest amount of dissatisfaction in\r\nNew Brunswick was that which arose from the management of the Crown\r\nlands. It was bad enough that the revenues arising from the public\r\ndomain should be disposed of without the consent of the legislature; but\r\nit was still worse when such regulations were made by the\r\nsurveyor-general as hindered the settlement of the country and\r\ninterfered with one of its leading industries. One great abuse was that\r\nlarge areas of the best land in the province were locked up as reserves\r\nfor the production of masts for His Majesty's navy. Another grievance\r\nwas the imposition of a duty of a shilling a ton on all pine timber cut\r\nin the province. This was done by the authority of the surveyor-general,\r\nand its effect was seriously to injure many of those who were engaged in\r\nlumbering. This tax was remitted for a time after the panic of the year\r\n1825, but it was revived when that crisis in the commercial life of the\r\nprovince had passed. The management of the Crown lands office had been\r\nthe subject of criticism at almost every session of the legislature for\r\ntwelve or fifteen years before Lemuel Wilmot entered public life, and\r\nevery year the complaints grew louder.\r\n\r\n{AN ADDRESS TO THE KING}\r\n\r\nAt the session of 1831, an address was presented to the president, the\r\nHon. William Black, asking him to lay before the House a detailed\r\naccount showing the amount of the casual and territorial revenue from\r\nthe beginning of 1824 to the end of 1830, and the expenditures from that\r\nfund for the same period. This was refused on the ground that it was\r\ninconsistent with his instructions. The House then resolved to bring the\r\nmatter to the notice of the king in an address, the spirit of which may\r\nbe gathered from the following paragraphs:--\r\n\r\n\"By the operation of the system practised in this office, very large\r\nsums are taken from the people of this province for licenses to cut\r\ntimber on Crown land, and, although the assembly do not question the\r\nright Your Majesty undoubtedly has to the lands in question, they think\r\nthe tremendous powers with which the commissioner is vested, with regard\r\nto impositions of tonnage money and the enormous exactions for fees, to\r\nbe incompatible with a free government, and to require redress.\r\n\r\n\"It is generally understood, as well as universally believed, that the\r\ncommissioner in question is under no control in this province, and to\r\nthis may be ascribed the mode in which licenses to cut timber are issued\r\nin very many cases, in quantities less than one hundred tons, subject to\r\na duty of one shilling, three pence per ton, and the excessive fee on\r\neach of forty-five shillings. By this mode, a large part of the receipts\r\nis paid in the shape of fees, at once injuring the subject without\r\nbenefiting the revenue; and the assembly feel convinced, if the office\r\nwere under colonial management, that while the oppressions would be\r\nremoved, the revenue would be more productive; and besides, the assembly\r\ncannot but view with just alarm that the day may possibly come when, by\r\na single mandate from the office, exactions of such magnitude may be\r\nmade as literally to stop the export trade of the country, a power which\r\nno person should have even the shadow of authority to exercise.\r\n\r\n\"The assembly at an early day in the present session, by an address to\r\nthe administrator of the government, sought for documents regarding\r\nthis office, to enable them officially to bring the subject more in\r\ndetail under the consideration of Your Majesty, but this information, so\r\nhighly desirable and necessary, has been withheld from them; and the\r\nassembly, therefore, with great submission, lay before Your Majesty\r\nherewith, a copy of the said address, with the reply thereto, for Your\r\nMajesty's gracious consideration.\r\n\r\n\"It will by that be seen that the objects contemplated by the assembly\r\nare no less than relieving Your Majesty's government permanently from\r\nthe burthen of the whole civil list of the province, a subject which the\r\nassembly humbly conceive to be of great advantage to the parent state,\r\nand only requiring that the revenues, from whatever source or sources\r\nderived in or collected within the province, should be placed under the\r\ncontrol of its legislature.\"\r\n\r\n{THE CIVIL LIST}\r\n\r\nA portion of the Crown-land revenue went to pay what was termed the\r\ncivil list, which included the salaries of the lieutenant-governor, the\r\njudges, the attorney-general, solicitor-general, private secretary,\r\nprovincial secretary, auditor, receiver-general and commissioner of\r\nCrown lands. The latter official received seventeen hundred and fifty\r\npounds sterling per annum besides enormous fees, so that his income was\r\ngreater than that of the lieutenant-governor. Thomas Baillie, an\r\nIrishman, who had been a subaltern in a marching regiment, had filled\r\nthat office since the year 1824, and continued to hold it until 1851,\r\ntwenty-seven years in all, when he retired with a pension twice as large\r\nas the salary of the present surveyor-general of New Brunswick.\r\n\r\nWhat the Reformers in the legislature of New Brunswick sought to obtain\r\nwas the control of the public lands, and the disposal of the revenues\r\nderived from them. To accomplish this they were willing to undertake to\r\npay the salaries embraced in the civil list, although these salaries\r\nwere looked upon by the people of the province generally as altogether\r\ntoo large. Yet there were great difficulties in the way of this\r\nnecessary reform, for King William IV was known to be violently opposed\r\nto it. At a later period, 1835, in the course of a conversation with the\r\nEarl of Gosford, who had been appointed governor of Lower Canada, \"I\r\nwill never consent,\" he said with an oath, \"to alienate the Crown lands,\r\nnor to make the council elective. Mind me, my Lord, the cabinet is not\r\nmy cabinet. They had better take care, or by ---- I will have them\r\nimpeached.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the language which this king used in regard to his\r\nconstitutional advisers. It was fortunate for New Brunswick and the\r\nother colonies of British North America that at that time he had done\r\nhis utmost to get rid of his ministers and had been defeated and\r\nhumiliated, so that they could set him at defiance. But in 1832 they\r\nwere more disposed to defer to his wishes, and in May of that year we\r\nfind Lord Goderich, the colonial secretary, writing to Sir Archibald\r\nCampbell, the lieutenant-governor of New Brunswick, in the following\r\nstrain:--\r\n\r\n\"The preservation to the Crown of the territorial revenue is an object\r\nof the first importance, and it would only be resigned on its being\r\nclearly proved that the right of the Crown could not be maintained\r\nwithout producing still greater inconvenience. You cannot, therefore,\r\nmore usefully exert your influence than in endeavouring to prevent the\r\nassembly from urging the surrender of this revenue.\"\r\n\r\n{CONTROL OF THE REVENUE}\r\n\r\nThe question of the control of the Crown-land or casual and territorial\r\nrevenues was made the subject of an address to the king by the House of\r\nAssembly in 1832. In this it was stated that the expense of collecting\r\nthese revenues was far greater than it would be under proper management,\r\nand it was proposed that they be placed under the control of the\r\nlegislature, which would undertake the payment of all the necessary\r\nexpenses of the civil government of the province by making such\r\npermanent and other grants as might be necessary for this purpose. The\r\nreply to this proposition was received during the legislative session of\r\n1833. In it Lord Goderich, with some appearance of sarcasm, observed\r\nthat \"His Majesty did not consider it necessary at present to call upon\r\nthe House for a grant of the nature proposed, as he did not anticipate\r\nsuch a falling off in the revenue at his disposal as the House appeared\r\nto have apprehended.\" This reply can hardly be regarded otherwise than\r\nas an insult to the House of Assembly, for the meaning of their address\r\nto the king was deliberately misrepresented. They were contending for a\r\nprinciple, that the revenue derived from the public domain should be\r\nunder the control of the legislature, and the amount of the revenue did\r\nnot enter into the question.\r\n\r\nIn 1833 the House of Assembly appointed a committee on grievances for\r\nthe purpose of taking into consideration and investigating all matters\r\nin connection with the Crown lands, which were the subject of complaint.\r\nAfter this committee had reported to the House, it was resolved to send\r\na deputation to England to endeavour to make some arrangement with the\r\ncolonial secretary in reference to the Crown lands.\r\n\r\n{MR. STANLEY'S DESPATCH}\r\n\r\nThe deputies appointed to proceed to England and lay the grievances of\r\nthe province at the foot of the throne were Charles Simonds and Edward\r\nB. Chandler, both men of wealth, influence and position, and well\r\nqualified for the performance of the work with which they were\r\nentrusted. Messrs. Chandler and Simonds arrived in England in June,\r\n1833, and immediately placed themselves in communication with the Right\r\nHonourable E. G. Stanley, who was then colonial secretary. Their report\r\nwas laid before the legislature in February, 1834, and the result was\r\nhighly satisfactory to the House of Assembly. A few days later a\r\ndespatch from Mr. Stanley to Sir Archibald Campbell was laid before the\r\nHouse, in which he stated the terms on which he should feel that His\r\nMajesty might properly be advised to place the proceeds of the casual\r\nand territorial revenue under the control of the assembly of New\r\nBrunswick. He would, he said, be prepared to advise His Majesty to\r\naccept a permanent appropriation by the legislature, duly secured to the\r\namount of fourteen thousand pounds per annum, and that the Crown should\r\nundertake to charge on any such permanent grant the salaries of the\r\nlieutenant-governor, his private secretary, the commissioner of Crown\r\nlands, provincial secretary, chief-justice, three puisne judges, the\r\nattorney-general, auditor, receiver-general, the expenses of the indoor\r\nestablishment of the Crown lands department, and a grant of one thousand\r\npounds to the college. It would be necessary, Mr. Stanley stated, that\r\nany bill passed in consequence of the proposal contained in this\r\ndespatch should contain a suspending clause in order that it might be\r\nsubmitted to His Majesty before it was finally assented to. It was also\r\nstated, in order to prevent misunderstanding or delay, that the House\r\nshould be apprised, that, unless some other fully equivalent and\r\nsufficient security could be devised, it would be expected that the Act\r\nshould provide that the stipulated annual commutation should be payable\r\nout of the first receipts in each year, and that in case of any default\r\nin such payment the whole of the revenue surrendered should revert to\r\nthe Crown. A committee was appointed to prepare the bill on the subject\r\nof the surrender by His Majesty of the casual and territorial revenues\r\nof the province. The House of Assembly had previously passed a\r\nresolution that the sum of fourteen thousand pounds required by His\r\nMajesty's government as a permanent grant for the surrender of the\r\ncasual and territorial revenues of the province was greater than the\r\ncharges contemplated to be thereon required, yet that the great desire\r\nof the House of Assembly to have this important subject finally settled\r\nshould induce them to accept the proposal contained in Mr. Stanley's\r\ndespatch. On the day after this resolution was passed, the\r\nlieutenant-governor communicated to the House of Assembly an extract\r\nfrom a despatch received the previous day by him from the Right\r\nHonourable Mr. Stanley, dated January 4th, 1834. This extract was as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n\"In your message communicating to the assembly the proposal contained in\r\nmy despatch of the 30th September, you will take care distinctly to\r\nexplain that the payments expected from the New Brunswick Land Company\r\nare not included in the revenue which is offered to the acceptance of\r\nthe assembly.\" It is with great regret that an historian of this period\r\nmust record the receipt of such a despatch from an imperial head of\r\ndepartment to a colonial governor, for the spirit displayed in the\r\nmessage was not that of an enlightened statesman, but such as might have\r\nbeen expected from one who was endeavouring to drive the hardest\r\npossible bargain with the province of New Brunswick, in order that a\r\nnumber of officials, swollen with pride and enjoying enormous salaries,\r\nmight not suffer.\r\n\r\n{NEGOTIATIONS FAIL}\r\n\r\nA few days after the receipt of this despatch, a resolution was passed\r\nby the House in committee, regretting that the additional condition\r\ncontained in Mr. Stanley's last despatch would prevent the committee\r\nrecommending to the House further action in the matter of preparing a\r\ncivil list bill. Thus ended the attempt to settle this vexed question in\r\nthe year 1834. The House of Assembly, however, still continued to\r\nagitate the matter, and to make Sir Archibald Campbell's life a burden\r\nto him. On March 7th, they addressed him, asking for accounts in detail\r\nof the casual and territorial revenues, and calling for a number of\r\nstatements which they had not received except in such a shape that they\r\ncould not be properly understood. They also addressed His Excellency,\r\nrequesting him to lay before them copies of all official despatches\r\ntransmitted to him by the secretary of state for the colonies, since he\r\nassumed the administration of the government, relating to the subject of\r\nthe casual and territorial revenues. The reply of His Excellency to the\r\nrequest for more detailed accounts was a courteous one; but while he\r\nconsented to furnish the accounts requested in detail, it was with the\r\nunderstanding that his compliance was not to be considered as a\r\nprecedent. He declined, however, to give the names of the parties who\r\nhad their timber seized or forfeited, or the names of the petitioners\r\nfor Crown land. He also refused to furnish the accounts of the\r\nreceiver-general and commissioner of Crown lands, on the ground that\r\nthey were accounts exclusively between these officers and the Crown.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the request for his correspondence with the colonial\r\nsecretary, Sir Archibald Campbell in another message gave a tart\r\nrefusal, stating that such a request was subversive of the principles\r\nand spirit of the British constitution, and that he would ill deserve\r\nthe confidence put in him by His Majesty were he to hesitate in meeting\r\nso dangerous an encroachment, not only on the independence of the\r\nexecutive, but the prerogatives of the British Crown, with a most\r\ndecided and unqualified refusal. This military officer considered\r\nhimself a proper exponent of the principles and spirit of the British\r\nconstitution. He failed to understand that the British constitution\r\nrests upon the support of the people, while his system of government was\r\nintended to ignore the people altogether.\r\n\r\n{QUARREL WITH THE GOVERNOR}\r\n\r\nA few days after the receipt of this message, a resolution was passed\r\nby the House of Assembly declaring that the language used by the\r\nlieutenant-governor, in his reply to the address of the House, was at\r\nvariance with all parliamentary precedent and usage, and such as was not\r\ncalled for by the address. Some of the governor's friends attempted to\r\nweaken the force of this resolution by an amendment of a milder nature,\r\nbut their amendment was defeated, and the resolution carried by a vote\r\nof fifteen to eight. Another address on the subject of the casual and\r\nterritorial revenues and civil list was prepared and passed by the\r\nassembly for the purpose of being forwarded to His Majesty. It recited\r\nthe proceedings, in regard to the matter, which had taken place already,\r\nand the desire of the House of Assembly to accept the proposition\r\ncontained in Mr. Stanley's despatch, and expressed the regret of the\r\nHouse at the new condition imposed with regard to the New Brunswick Land\r\nCompany, which made it impossible to accept the settlement as amended.\r\nThe House concluded by expressing the hope that the terms proposed in\r\nthe original despatch might yet be considered definitive, and that the\r\nproviso with regard to the New Brunswick Land Company might be\r\nwithdrawn. This was transmitted to England; but, before the year ended,\r\nSir Archibald Campbell concluded to rid himself of the House of\r\nAssembly, which had given him so much annoyance, and accordingly it was\r\ndissolved early in November; so that when the legislature met again in\r\nJanuary, 1835, the House was a new one, although largely composed of the\r\nold members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nWILMOT IN THE LEGISLATURE\r\n\r\n\r\nWilmot acquired a good legal practice soon after his admission to the\r\nbar, and was recognized as a highly successful advocate in cases before\r\na jury. In the opinion of the legal profession he never was a deeply\r\nread lawyer, either as a barrister or as a judge, but in the conduct of\r\na case at _nisi prius_ he could hardly have been surpassed. He had the\r\ngift which has been possessed by all great advocates, of seizing on the\r\nleading feature of a case, and, regardless of all minor issues, pressing\r\nit home on the minds of the jury. His eloquent and impressive speeches\r\non behalf of his clients soon began to attract general attention, and\r\nthe court-house was thronged when it was known that he was about to\r\naddress a jury. He was speedily marked as the proper person to represent\r\nthe views of the people in the House of Assembly, and, on a vacancy\r\noccurring in the representation of the county of York in consequence of\r\nthe death of one of the members in the summer of 1834, Wilmot was\r\nelected without opposition, none of the government party having the\r\ncourage to oppose him. Before the time came round for the meeting of the\r\nlegislature, the House was dissolved by Sir Archibald Campbell, in the\r\nhope that he might be able to get an assembly more amenable to his\r\nwishes, and, at the general election which followed, Wilmot was again\r\nelected, at the head of the poll. At that time he had barely completed\r\nhis twenty-fifth year. It was a great triumph for Wilmot and the friends\r\nof Reform, for all the influence of the friends of the governor and the\r\nFamily Compact was arrayed against him.\r\n\r\n{ENTERS THE LEGISLATURE}\r\n\r\nMr. Wilmot took his seat as a member of the House of Assembly on January\r\n25th, 1835. Young as he was, he had already made a great reputation as a\r\npublic speaker, and there was no man in the legislature or in the\r\nprovince who could stand any comparison with him in point of eloquence.\r\nIndeed, it is doubtful whether the British North American provinces have\r\never produced a man who was Wilmot's superior in that style of oratory\r\nwhich is so telling on the hustings or where great masses of men are to\r\nbe moved. The evidence of this fact does not rest on the testimony of\r\nhis countrymen alone, for he acquired a wider fame for eloquence than\r\nthey could give him. At the Portland Railway Convention of 1850, where\r\nthe ablest men of the Northern States were gathered, he easily eclipsed\r\nthem all by his brilliant and powerful oratory. The reporters are said\r\nto have thrown down their pencils in despair, being unable to keep pace\r\nwith him as he aroused the enthusiasm of all who heard him by his\r\nburning words. Unfortunately, there is no form of ability which is so\r\ntransient in its effects as this perfervid style of oratory. So much of\r\nits potency depends on the action of the speaker, on the glance of his\r\neye and the modulation of his voice, that no report could do justice to\r\nit, even if there had been reporters at that time capable of putting\r\ndown every word he uttered. The speeches of even Gladstone, when\r\nreported word for word, read but indifferently when seen in cold type,\r\nand no speech of Wilmot's was ever properly reported. He was incapable\r\nof writing out a speech after he had delivered it, so that we must take\r\nthe united testimony of his contemporaries, whether friends or enemies,\r\nthat he was, upon his own ground, an unequalled speaker.\r\n\r\nThe House in which he now found himself was not one that was remarkable\r\nfor its eloquence. Unlike most of the legislatures of the present day,\r\nthe proportion of lawyers was very small, there being only five in a\r\nHouse of thirty members, and of these five the only one who was an\r\norator was Wilmot. The other twenty-five members were mostly business\r\nmen and farmers, some of whom could express their views on public\r\nquestions clearly enough, but had no pretensions to eloquence. Yet it\r\nwas a good House, and one of its best features was that its members were\r\nable to appreciate the worth of the new representative from the county\r\nof York.\r\n\r\nThe aim of Wilmot, when he entered the legislature, was to bring the\r\nprovince into line with the principles of responsible government as\r\nunderstood in the mother country. Yet, looking at the state of New\r\nBrunswick then, it is easy to see that the task he had undertaken was\r\none of enormous difficulty. Most of the evils of which the people had\r\nbeen complaining still existed. The casual and territorial revenue was\r\nstill under the control of the home authorities, the custom-house\r\nestablishment still remained unreformed, the Family Compact still\r\ncontrolled all the great public offices, and none but members of the\r\nChurch of England were thought worthy to serve their country in a public\r\ncapacity.\r\n\r\nTwo years earlier the executive and legislative councils had been\r\nseparated; but the change had made little or no improvement in the\r\nsystem of government. The executive council consisted of five members,\r\nall of whom held public offices from which they could not be removed by\r\nany act of the legislature. The first on the list was Baillie, the\r\nsurveyor-general, whose record has already been referred to; next came\r\nF. P. Robinson, the auditor of the king's casual revenue; another was\r\nWilliam F. Odell, whose father had been provincial secretary for\r\ntwenty-eight years, and who himself filled the same office for\r\nthirty-two years. George F. Street, the solicitor-general, was another\r\nmember of the executive, and the last on the list was John Simcoe\r\nSaunders, who was advocate-general and held three or four\r\ncommissionerships besides. All these men were so solidly entrenched in\r\ntheir positions that it seemed impossible they should ever be disturbed.\r\nThey formed a solid phalanx opposed to all reform, and they were\r\nsupported by the governor, Sir Archibald Campbell, most of whose life\r\nhad been spent in India and who, however well fitted to govern Hindoos,\r\nwas hardly the man to give laws to white men who claimed to be free.\r\n\r\n{BECOMES A LEADER}\r\n\r\nAs soon as Wilmot entered the House of Assembly, he began to take a\r\nleading part in its debates. The very day he took his seat he was\r\nappointed on the committee to prepare an address in reply to the speech\r\nfrom the throne. On the following day he gave notice of a resolution\r\nwith regard to the boundary between Maine and New Brunswick, a subject\r\nthat was then coming to the front. A day or two later he brought in a\r\nbill to continue the Act to provide for the expenses of judges on\r\ncircuits. Indeed, no man was more active during that first session than\r\nthe new member for the county of York.\r\n\r\nThere were two questions that came up for discussion in which, as a\r\nReformer, he was specially interested,--the salaries of the customs\r\nestablishment, and the casual and territorial revenue. With regard to\r\nthe latter, when the House had been sitting about a month, the reply of\r\nthe colonial secretary to the address of the previous session was laid\r\nbefore it. That address, it will be remembered, related to the offer\r\nwhich had been made to the British government to take over the Crown\r\nlands and provide for a civil list of fourteen thousand pounds sterling,\r\nthe payments expected from the New Brunswick Land Company to be included\r\nin this arrangement. The reply of the colonial secretary was as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n\"From various parts of the address I infer that the proposal conveyed to\r\nthe assembly, through my predecessors, must have been misapprehended in\r\nmore than one important particular; and I have especially remarked the\r\nerroneous assumption that, in offering to surrender the proceeds of the\r\nCrown lands, it was intended also to give up their management, and to\r\nplace them under the control of the legislature.\r\n\r\n\"From the course of their proceedings, as well as the tenor of the\r\npresent expression of their sentiments, the assembly must be understood\r\nto consider it an indispensable condition that the payments of the Land\r\nCompany should be comprised among the objects to be surrendered to them.\r\nThis is a condition to which His Majesty's government cannot agree. His\r\nMajesty's government would also be unable to recognize the\r\ninterpretation which was placed on their former offer, so far as regards\r\nthe control over the lands belonging to the Crown in New Brunswick.\r\nUnder these circumstances, I can only desire you to convey to the\r\nassembly His Majesty's regrets that the objects of their address cannot\r\nbe complied with, and, adverting to the wide difference between the\r\nviews entertained by the government and those manifested by the assembly\r\non this subject, it seems to me that no advantage could be anticipated\r\nfrom making any further proposals at present respecting the cession of\r\nthe territorial revenue.\"\r\n\r\n{RENEWED AGITATION}\r\n\r\nThis despatch, which brought a sudden close to the negotiations with\r\nregard to the casual and territorial revenues of the province, did not\r\nemanate from the government with which the House of Assembly had been\r\npreviously negotiating, but from a new administration which had just\r\nbeen formed under the premiership of Sir Robert Peel, and which lasted\r\njust one hundred and forty-five days. The creation of this\r\nadministration was due to the action of King William IV, in dismissing\r\nhis advisers on the death of Earl Spencer, which removed Lord Althorp\r\nfrom the House of Commons. The king had grown to detest his cabinet for\r\ntheir reforming spirit, but his designs were thwarted by the failure of\r\nSir Robert Peel to form an administration capable of facing the House of\r\nCommons. As a consequence, Viscount Melbourne again became premier, and\r\na renewal of the negotiations with the government in regard to the\r\ncasual and territorial revenues was rendered possible.\r\n\r\nThe House of Assembly was still determined to keep the question of the\r\ncasual and territorial revenue to the front, and at a later period in\r\nthe session another address on this subject was prepared by the House of\r\nAssembly, to be laid before His Majesty. In this address the grievances\r\nwith regard to the management of the Crown lands of New Brunswick were\r\nrecited, and the willingness of the legislature to provide for the civil\r\nestablishment of the province was stated. The address urged the benefits\r\nthat would result to the people of New Brunswick from placing the net\r\nproceeds of the Crown-land revenues under the control of the\r\nlegislature. Attached to this address was a schedule of salaries\r\nproposed to be paid out of the casual and territorial revenues,\r\namounting in all to £10,500 currency. The address was transmitted to the\r\ngovernor to be forwarded to His Majesty. No specific answer was ever\r\nmade to this proposal, a fact which was probably due to the confusion,\r\nincident to the change of government, which took place about the time\r\nthe address reached Downing Street.\r\n\r\n{CUSTOM-HOUSE SALARIES}\r\n\r\nAnother matter which engaged the attention of the House during this\r\nsession, and in which Wilmot took an active interest, was the settlement\r\nof the salaries of the custom-house officials. Although the surplus\r\nrevenue from this source went into the provincial treasury, the amount\r\nthus received was much less than it ought to have been, in consequence\r\nof the large salaries which were paid to the officials. In the year 1830\r\nthe amount of custom-house duties collected in the province was £16,616\r\n18s. 11d. sterling, from which was deducted for salaries £7,073 6s., or\r\nnearly one-half of the whole amount. The House of Assembly objected to\r\nthe payment of such large salaries, and in 1831 proposed to the British\r\ngovernment to make a permanent annual grant of £4,250 sterling for the\r\npayment of customs officials in New Brunswick. This proposal was\r\naccepted, and in the following year a bill was passed in accordance with\r\nthis arrangement. But it was protested against by the customs\r\nauthorities in England and disallowed because the salaries of the\r\nofficers of customs were not made the first charge on the revenue.\r\nDuring the session of 1835, an amended bill embracing this provision was\r\npassed, and the question was settled for the time. Mr. Wilmot was not\r\nsatisfied with this arrangement, because it was a violation of the\r\nprinciple that the House of Assembly should have control of the\r\nprovincial revenue, and he therefore voted against it. Nevertheless, the\r\nmeasure apart from this violation of a fundamental principle, was a gain\r\nto the province, as it placed a considerable sum additional in the\r\npublic treasury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nWILMOT AS A DELEGATE TO THE COLONIAL OFFICE\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Wilmot took a very active part in the proceedings of the legislature\r\nduring the session of 1836, and was the moving spirit in the committee\r\nof the whole to inquire into the state of the province during that\r\nsession. The result was the passing by large majorities of a series of\r\ntwenty-six resolutions condemning the management of the Crown lands\r\noffice, the composition of the executive council and also of the\r\nlegislative council, and declaring that the control of the casual and\r\nterritorial revenues should be placed in the hands of the legislature.\r\nThese resolutions were made the basis of an address to His Majesty,\r\nwhich was to be carried to England by a deputation of two members of the\r\nHouse of Assembly. This address relates at length the principal facts of\r\nthe management of the Crown lands and the reasons of the House of\r\nAssembly for dissatisfaction therewith. Mr. Wilmot, in recognition of\r\nthe active part he had taken in this business, was appointed a member of\r\nthe delegation, the other member being William Crane of Westmorland, a\r\ngentleman of experience, wealth and standing in the province. This\r\nappointment was the highest compliment that could possibly have been\r\npaid to Wilmot's capacity, for the negotiation then to be conducted with\r\nthe colonial office was of the most important and delicate character,\r\nand one which vitally affected the interests of the province.\r\n\r\nThe colonial secretary at that time was Lord Glenelg, a statesman whose\r\ncharacter has been drawn by Sir Henry Taylor, who was then a clerk in\r\nthe colonial office. \"Amiable and excellent as he was,\" says Taylor, \"a\r\nmore incompetent man could not have been found to fill an office\r\nrequiring activity and ready judgment. A dart flung at him by Lord\r\nBrougham in 1838 points to his notorious defect as a minister called\r\nupon to deal with a crisis. The then crisis was that of the Canadian\r\nRebellion.\" \"It is indeed,\" said Lord Brougham, \"a most alarming and\r\nfrightful state of things, and I am sure must have given my noble friend\r\nmany a sleepless day.\" It was probably because of Lord Glenelg's habit\r\nof procrastination that the delegates had to remain in London for four\r\nmonths before they were able to bring their business to a conclusion.\r\nThey arrived there about the middle of June, and it was well on in\r\nOctober before they were able to leave. The result of their work was\r\nthat an arrangement was made satisfactory both to the British government\r\nand to the delegates representing the House of Assembly, by which the\r\ncasual and territorial revenues were to be transferred to the province,\r\nin consideration of the legislature undertaking to provide for a civil\r\nlist of £14,500 currency annually, for the payment of certain salaries\r\nchargeable to that fund. A draft of a Civil List Bill was prepared and\r\nagreed to by the lords of the treasury, and the understanding was that\r\nthis bill should be passed by the legislature, and receive the assent of\r\nthe lieutenant-governor, when it would immediately become operative.\r\n\r\n{CIVIL GOVERNMENT BILL}\r\n\r\nThe first clause of this bill transferred the proceeds of the\r\nterritorial and casual revenues, and of all woods, mines and royalties\r\nwhich had been collected and were then in hand, or which should\r\nthereafter be collected, to the provincial treasurer, who was authorized\r\nto receive them for the use of the province, while the Act remained in\r\nforce. The second clause charged the revenues with the payment of\r\n£14,500 for a civil list. The third clause enacted that all the surplus\r\nover and above the sum of £14,500 currency, should remain in the\r\ntreasury of the province until appropriated or disposed of by an Act or\r\nActs of the general assembly. The fourth clause gave the\r\nlieutenant-governor, with the advice of his executive council, power to\r\nexpend such sums as they might deem necessary for the prudent\r\nmanagement, protection and collection of the said revenues, a detailed\r\naccount of which was to be laid before the legislature within fourteen\r\ndays of the commencement of each session, with all vouchers for the\r\nsame. It was also enacted that all grants or sales of Crown lands should\r\nbe void, unless the land had been sold at public auction after due\r\nnotice in the _Royal Gazette_. By this arrangement the House of Assembly\r\nhad obtained the boon for which it had so long been contending, but\r\nthere was still one more obstacle to be overcome,--the opposition of the\r\nlieutenant-governor, Sir Archibald Campbell, who had entered into a plot\r\nwith some of the enemies of freedom in the province for the purpose of\r\nthwarting, not only the wishes of the House of Assembly, but also the\r\nintentions of the home government. As soon as Sir Archibald Campbell was\r\napprised of the intention of His Majesty's advisers in England to\r\ntransfer the casual and territorial revenues to the provincial\r\nlegislature, he commenced a correspondence with the colonial office,\r\npointing out what he deemed to be imperfections in the scheme which they\r\nhad prepared for the management of the public lands. He pretended to\r\nhave discovered that there was some error in the calculation of the\r\nlords of the treasury with regard to the sum to be paid in lieu of the\r\ncivil list, and that the amount of £14,500 currency would not be\r\nsufficient to defray all the expenditures chargeable on the civil list.\r\n\r\n{AN OBSTRUCTIVE GOVERNOR}\r\n\r\nSir Archibald Campbell, soon after the opening of the session of the\r\nlegislature, in December 1836, requested the House of Assembly to add a\r\nsuspending clause to any Civil List Bill they might pass, so that he\r\nmight forward it to the home government for their approval. As this was\r\nentirely contrary to the understanding which had been reached between\r\nMessrs. Wilmot and Crane and the colonial secretary,--it being\r\nunderstood that the bill if passed in the form agreed upon would be\r\nimmediately assented to by the lieutenant-governor,--the House of\r\nAssembly very naturally refused to comply with Sir Archibald's wishes.\r\nHe, however, held firm in his resolution, and the Civil List Bill which\r\nhad been agreed to by the home authorities, after being passed by both\r\nHouses, did not receive his assent. At the close of the session, while\r\nthe matter was under discussion, at the instigation of the\r\nlieutenant-governor one of the executive council, Solicitor-General\r\nStreet, was sent on a secret mission to Downing Street. The object of\r\nthis mission was to make such representations to the home authorities as\r\nwould induce them to delay giving their assent to the Civil List Bill.\r\nThe truth of the matter seems to have been that Sir Archibald Campbell\r\nand his advisers in New Brunswick thought if they could only gain time\r\nthe Liberal government of England which had granted such favourable\r\nterms to the province might be defeated, and a Tory government come into\r\npower which would speedily undo all that their predecessors had done,\r\nand refuse to grant any concessions to the legislature of New Brunswick.\r\nThere was great excitement in the province in consequence of the action\r\nof the lieutenant-governor, and this excitement was fairly voiced in the\r\nHouse of Assembly, where an address was prepared representing the\r\ncondition of affairs to His Majesty, and detailing the manner in which\r\nthe lieutenant-governor had sought to thwart the intentions of the\r\nimperial government. This address was passed by a vote of twenty-seven\r\nto two, the only members of the House who ventured to stand with the man\r\nwho occupied Government House being John Ambrose Street and William End.\r\n\r\n{CIVIL GOVERNMENT BILL PASSED}\r\n\r\nMessrs. Crane and Wilmot were again appointed a deputation to proceed to\r\nEngland with the address of the House of Assembly, and took their\r\ndeparture two days after it was passed, amidst great popular\r\ndemonstrations by the citizens of Fredericton. The legislature was\r\nprorogued on March 1st, on which day the House of Assembly again\r\nrequested the lieutenant-governor to pass the Civil List Bill, pointing\r\nout that under the arrangements made with the colonial office it was his\r\nduty to do so, but their request fell upon deaf ears. In the speech\r\nproroguing the legislature, Sir Archibald Campbell stated that he had\r\nwithheld his assent from this bill because a suspending clause had not\r\nbeen appended to it. These were the last words that this obstinate\r\ngovernor was destined to speak before a New Brunswick legislature.\r\nFinding that all his hopes of impeding the progress of the province in\r\nthe direction of political liberty were in vain, he tendered his\r\nresignation to save himself from being removed, as he would have been,\r\nfor his direct disobedience to the commands of his superiors in\r\nEngland.[1] Sir John Harvey, another soldier, but a man of a very\r\ndifferent spirit, was appointed to succeed him as lieutenant-governor.\r\nThe Civil List Bill was again passed at a special session of the\r\nlegislature and received the assent of the governor, becoming law on\r\nJuly 17th, 1837. From that time to the present, the province of New\r\nBrunswick has controlled the revenues which it derives from its Crown\r\nlands and similar sources, and, whether wisely expended or not, the\r\npeople of this province have at least the satisfaction of knowing that\r\nthe money is appropriated by their own representatives, and by a\r\ngovernment which is responsible to them for its actions.\r\n\r\nThe death of King William IV took place during the summer of 1837, and\r\nbrought about another general election. Mr. Wilmot again stood for the\r\ncounty of York and was returned at the head of the poll. This was only a\r\nproper recognition of his eminent services to the province in the\r\nlegislature and as a delegate to England. At this election, Charles\r\nFisher, a young lawyer, was also returned for the county of York. Mr.\r\nFisher, although not so fluent a speaker as Wilmot, was second to no man\r\nin the legislature in devotion to Liberal principles, and he proved a\r\nmost valuable lieutenant in the battle for responsible government which\r\nnow began. The contest for the control of the Crown lands of the\r\nprovince had been won, but a still more difficult task remained for the\r\nfriends of constitutional principles to accomplish,--the making of the\r\nexecutive responsible to the people. The members of the House of\r\nAssembly had been almost unanimous in demanding the control of the Crown\r\nlands, but, when it came to applying the principles of responsible\r\ngovernment to the affairs of the province generally, there were many\r\ndeserters from the ranks of those who had called themselves Reformers.\r\nThis was partly due to the principles of responsible government not\r\nbeing well understood even by some members of the legislature, and\r\npartly to the fact that the question did not touch the self-interest of\r\nthe members in the same manner as the mismanagement of the Crown lands\r\ndepartment had done.\r\n\r\nUnder a thoroughly constitutional system of government the initiation of\r\nmoney grants would have been in the hands of the executive, but in 1837\r\nnot a single member of the executive council had a seat in the House of\r\nAssembly. Three of the five members of the executive council were also\r\nmembers of the legislative council, but the two others had no seat in\r\neither House, a fact which shows on what lax principles the executive\r\nwas constructed. The initiation of money grants being in the House of\r\nAssembly, any private member had it in his power to move an\r\nappropriation of money for any object that he pleased. In this way a\r\nsystem of \"log rolling\" was inaugurated in the legislature, which\r\nresulted in extravagant expenditures and the appropriation of money for\r\nobjects which, under a better system, would not have received it. It was\r\nimpossible to put any check upon the expenditure or to keep it within\r\nthe income under such an arrangement, and one of the first efforts of\r\nthe Reformers was therefore directed to the removal of this abuse.\r\nUnfortunately this was, of all the proposed reforms in the constitution,\r\nthe one most difficult to carry, and it was not accomplished until after\r\nWilmot had retired from public life.\r\n\r\n{KING'S COLLEGE}\r\n\r\nOne of the subjects which engaged the attention of Mr. Wilmot, at an\r\nearly period of his legislative career, was the charter of King's\r\nCollege. This charter had been obtained in 1828 from His Majesty, King\r\nGeorge IV, and the legislature had granted the college an endowment of\r\neleven hundred pounds currency a year, in addition to ten hundred pounds\r\nsterling granted by the king out of the casual and territorial revenues\r\nof the province. The aim of the charter was to make the college a Church\r\nof England institution exclusively, for it provided that the bishop of\r\nthe diocese should be the visitor of the college, and that the president\r\nshould always be a clergyman in holy orders of the United Church of\r\nEngland and Ireland. No religious test was required of students\r\nmatriculating or taking degrees in arts, but the council of the college,\r\nwhich was the governing body, was to be composed of members of the\r\nChurch of England, who, previous to their appointment, had subscribed to\r\nthe thirty-nine articles. The professors, to the number of seven, who\r\nwere members of the Church of England, were to be members of the\r\ncouncil, so that, although no religious test was required of them, it\r\nwas reasonably certain that none but persons of that denomination would\r\nbe appointed to professorships. These terms were much complained of, and\r\nsurely it was absurd to place a provincial college under the control of\r\na single denomination which could not claim more than one-third of the\r\npopulation of the province as belonging to its communion. It is stated\r\nin Fullom's _Life of Sir Howard Douglas_, who was lieutenant-governor of\r\nthe province at the time, that the charter would have been much less\r\nliberal than it was if it had not been for his efforts. The Bishop of\r\nNova Scotia and the Bishop of London desired to confine it entirely to\r\nstudents belonging to the Church of England, and to make subscription to\r\nthe thirty-nine articles a condition precedent to the granting of\r\ndegrees in arts. On the other hand, Attorney-General Peters in 1845,\r\nwhen the amendments to the charter were discussed in the legislative\r\ncouncil, stated that the charter as originally drafted and sent to\r\nEngland was much more liberal in its provisions than when finally\r\npassed, but that in 1828, to the surprise of Sir Howard Douglas, the\r\nthen existing charter came out copied from one obtained by Dr. Strachan\r\nfor Upper Canada. If this statement was correct, it affords a singular\r\nillustration of the injury that the bigotry of one man can cause to\r\nfuture generations. If King's College had treated all denominations on\r\nequal terms, all would have resorted to it for higher education. As it\r\nwas, it became the college of only a section of the people, the\r\ndifferent denominations established colleges of their own, and when\r\nfinally the connection between the Church of England and King's College\r\nwas severed and it became the University of New Brunswick, the\r\ndenominational colleges had become so well established that it could\r\nhardly compete with them on equal terms.\r\n\r\n{AN EXCLUSIVE INSTITUTION}\r\n\r\nDuring the session of 1838 Mr. Wilmot, as chairman, submitted to the\r\nlegislature the report of the select committee which had been appointed\r\nto take into consideration the state of the college. In this report it\r\nwas proposed to make certain alterations in the charter for the purpose\r\nof rendering it more acceptable to those who were not in the communion\r\nof the Church of England. In 1839 he introduced a bill in the House of\r\nAssembly embracing these amendments. The principal changes were to make\r\nthe lieutenant-governor visitor of the college instead of the bishop, to\r\nrepeal the section which provided that the president of the college must\r\nbe a member of the Church of England, and to make persons of every\r\ndenomination eligible for members of the college council. The\r\nprofessorship of theology was still retained, and students in that\r\ncourse were still required to subscribe to the thirty-nine articles,\r\nwhile services were held in the college morning and evening according to\r\nthe rites of the Church of England. These changes were certainly of a\r\nvery moderate character, but they were stoutly resisted by the college\r\nauthorities and their friends. They put forward the plea that the\r\nlegislature had no right to alter a royal charter, that to do so was an\r\ninterference with the royal prerogative, and that the direst consequence\r\nwould ensue if the constitution of the college was changed. According to\r\ntheir view, a royal charter once granted, the king himself, even with\r\nthe assistance of both branches of the legislature, could not amend it.\r\nThe college authorities also denied that they were under the control of\r\nthe legislature in any way, or responsible to it for their management of\r\nthe institution, although they were living on money voted by the\r\nlegislature for its support.\r\n\r\n{ADDRESS TO THE QUEEN}\r\n\r\nWilmot's bill passed the House of Assembly, but was defeated in the\r\nlegislative council. A similar bill was introduced by him in 1840, but\r\npostponed in consequence of a communication from the college council\r\nwhich seemed to show an inclination to yield something to the demands of\r\nthe public. But a fatal objection to these modifications being accepted\r\nwas the insistence of the college council that the bishop of the\r\ndiocese, or in his absence the archdeacon, should be a member of that\r\nbody. Representatives of the Presbyterians, Methodists and Baptists\r\npointed out in a memorial to the lieutenant-governor that the exclusive\r\ncharacter of the council would still remain, as that body would be\r\ncomposed wholly of members of the Church of England. Lord John Russell,\r\nthe colonial secretary, to whom the matter had been referred, suggested\r\nthat the college should surrender its charter and that a new one should\r\nbe prepared embracing the proposed changes, but the college council took\r\nno steps to carry these suggestions into effect. This being the case, at\r\nWilmot's instance the House of Assembly proposed an address to the queen\r\nsetting forth the facts of the case and asking Her Majesty to assent to\r\na bill, a draft of which was enclosed, which the House of Assembly was\r\nprepared to pass.\r\n\r\nAt the session of 1842 Wilmot again introduced the King's College Bill,\r\nand it was passed by the House, but again rejected by the legislative\r\ncouncil. Early in the session of 1843, the lieutenant-governor\r\ncommunicated to the House by message two despatches from Downing Street\r\non the subject of the college. One of these was from Lord John Russell,\r\nand the other from his successor, Lord Stanley. Lord John laid down the\r\ndoctrine that \"it is a principle of undoubted validity that a grant of\r\nfranchise by the Crown is irrevocable and unalterable by a further\r\nexercise of the royal authority unless the power of revocation and\r\nchange be embodied and reserved in the original grant, or unless the\r\ngrantees make a voluntary surrender of their franchises.\" Lord John had\r\nevidently forgotten his English history, or he would have known that\r\nEnglish kings on many occasions had revoked charters granted by\r\nthemselves or their predecessors.[2] Lord John desired the college to\r\nsurrender its charter and accept a new one, but Lord Stanley and the law\r\nofficers of the Crown whom he had consulted held a different view, and\r\nthought that a new charter could be granted to supersede the old. Both\r\ncolonial secretaries were desirous that the changes in the constitution\r\nof the college should be effected by a new royal charter. But this did\r\nnot suit the views of the House of Assembly, and after another college\r\nbill had been defeated in the House and rejected by the council, on\r\nMarch 20th, 1843, the following resolution, which was moved by Mr.\r\nWilmot, was passed by the House without a division:--\r\n\r\n\"WHEREAS, The assembly, during several years past, have endeavoured,\r\nwithout success, to effect certain reasonable modifications in the\r\ncharter of King's College; and whereas those modifications as contained\r\nin the bill which has been rejected by the legislative council, during\r\nthe present session, have been loudly and repeatedly called for by\r\nnumerous petitions from nearly every county in the province, while no\r\npetition has ever been presented against those modifications; and\r\nwhereas it is in vain to expect the amount of public benefit from the\r\ninstitution which its munificent endowment from the provincial revenue\r\nshould ensure; therefore,\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That this House have learned with much regret and\r\ndisappointment that a majority of the legislative council have rejected\r\nthe said bill during the present session; and further\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That this House should persevere in their endeavours to\r\namend the said charter by legislative enactment, and not resort to an\r\naddress to the throne for a new charter; and that this House will\r\nsteadfastly adhere to the principle that all the educational\r\nestablishments of the province, which are endowed from the colonial\r\nrevenues, whether incorporated by royal charter or otherwise, should be\r\nat all times subject to the supervision of the local legislature.\"\r\n\r\n{COLLEGE CHARTER AMENDED}\r\n\r\nThis resolution embodied a great principle to which the House of\r\nAssembly was determined to adhere, and which was very soon carried out.\r\nIn 1844 the college amendment bill was again rejected by the council,\r\nbut this was the last effort of that reactionary body to defeat the\r\nwishes of the people. At the session of 1845, the college bill was\r\nagain introduced by Mr. Wilmot, and this time it passed both Houses.\r\nBut like many important bills of that day it was reserved for Her\r\nMajesty's pleasure and although passed in March, 1845, it was not until\r\nDecember, 1846, that it received the royal assent and became law.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] This is shown by the correspondence of Sir John Harvey with the\r\ncolonial office. Sir John was then governor of Prince Edward Island.\r\n\r\n[2] Charles II annulled the charter of Massachusetts, and disposed in a\r\nsimilar fashion of the charter of the city of London, as well as of many\r\nEnglish towns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nLORD JOHN RUSSELL ON TENURE OF OFFICE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the session of 1840 Sir John Harvey, the lieutenant-governor,\r\ncommunicated to the legislature a despatch which he had received from\r\nLord John Russell a short time before. This dealt with the question of\r\nthe tenure of public offices in the gift of the Crown throughout the\r\nBritish colonies. Lord John had been struck by the fact that, while the\r\ngovernor of a colony was liable to have his commission revoked at any\r\ntime, the commissions of all other public officials were very rarely\r\nrecalled except for positive misconduct. In New Brunswick offices had\r\nbeen held generally for life and sometimes for two lives, as was the\r\ncase with the Odells, father and son, who filled the position of\r\nsecretary of the province for sixty years. One attorney-general of the\r\nprovince had held office for twenty-four years, another for nineteen\r\nyears and a third for twenty years. One surveyor-general held office for\r\nthirty-three years and another for almost thirty years. Under such a\r\nsystem, it was clear that responsible government could make no advance,\r\nfor these officials held their positions quite independently of the\r\nwishes of the legislature. Lord John Russell thought that the time had\r\ncome when a different course should be followed, and his despatch was\r\nfor the purpose of announcing to the lieutenant-governor the rules which\r\nwould hereafter be observed in the province of New Brunswick. He said:--\r\n\r\n\"You will understand, and cause it to be made generally known, that\r\nhereafter the tenure of colonial offices held during Her Majesty's\r\npleasure will not be regarded as equivalent to a tenure during good\r\nbehaviour, but that not only such officers will be called upon to retire\r\nfrom the public service as often as any sufficient motives of public\r\npolicy may suggest the expediency of that measure, but that a change in\r\nthe person of the governor will be considered as a sufficient reason for\r\nany alterations which his successor may deem it expedient to make in the\r\nlist of public functionaries, subject, of course, to the future\r\nconfirmation of the sovereign.\r\n\r\n\"These remarks do not extend to judicial offices, nor are they meant to\r\napply to places which are altogether ministerial, and which do not\r\ndevolve upon the holders of them duties, in the right discharge of which\r\nthe character or policy of the government are directly involved. They\r\nare intended to apply rather to the heads of departments than to persons\r\nserving as clerks, or in similar capacities under them. Neither do they\r\nextend to officers in the services of the lords commissioners of the\r\ntreasury. The functionaries who will be chiefly, though not exclusively,\r\naffected by them, are the colonial secretary, the treasurer or\r\nreceiver-general, the surveyor-general, the attorney-general and\r\nsolicitor-general, the sheriff or provost marshal, and other officers,\r\nwho under different designations from these, are entrusted with the same\r\nor similar duties. To this list must be also added the members of the\r\ncouncil, especially in those colonies in which the legislative and\r\nexecutive councils are distinct bodies.\r\n\r\n\"The application of these rules to officers to be hereafter appointed\r\nwill be attended with no practical difficulty. It may not be equally\r\neasy to enforce them in the case of existing officers, and especially of\r\nthose who may have left this country for the express purpose of\r\naccepting the offices they at present fill. Every reasonable indulgence\r\nmust be shown for the expectations which such persons have been\r\nencouraged to form. But even in these instances it will be necessary\r\nthat the right of enforcing these regulations should be distinctly\r\nmaintained, in practice as well as in theory, as often as the public\r\ngood may clearly demand the enforcement of them. It may not be\r\nunadvisable to compensate any such officers for their disappointment,\r\neven by pecuniary grants, when it may appear unjust to dispense with\r\ntheir services without such an indemnity.\"\r\n\r\n{AN HISTORIC DESPATCH}\r\n\r\nThis despatch produced consternation among those who had been accustomed\r\nto regard their offices as held on a life tenure, but it was looked\r\nupon by all the friends of good government as the beginning of a new\r\nand better order of things with respect to the public services. The\r\nmatter was considered by a committee of the whole House a few days after\r\nthe despatch was received, and an effort was made by Wilmot to have a\r\nfavourable vote with regard to it. But although the friends of the old\r\nFamily Compact always professed to be extremely loyal and to pay great\r\ndeference to the wishes of the British government, on this occasion they\r\npursued a different course. A majority of the House voted down a\r\nresolution which affirmed that this despatch should be \"highly\r\nsatisfactory,\" \"affording, as it does, the most satisfactory proof of a\r\nsincere desire on the part of our Most Gracious Queen and her government\r\nto infuse principles in the administration of colonial affairs strictly\r\nanalogous to the principles of the British constitution.\" Instead of\r\npassing this sensible resolution the committee, by the casting vote of\r\nthe chairman, passed the following absurd amendment:--\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, As the opinion of this committee, that there is nothing in\r\nthe despatch of the Right Honourable Lord John Russell, now under\r\nconsideration, to call forth any expression from the House on the\r\nsubject of colonial government, and that in the event of any occurrence\r\ntaking place to disturb the present happy political state of the\r\nprovince, the House cannot but entertain the opinion that any loyal and\r\ndutiful representations which they may have occasion to lay at the foot\r\nof the throne will receive, as they have always done, the royal\r\nconsideration.\"\r\n\r\nThe vote on the original resolution was fifteen to thirteen, so that,\r\nalthough defeated, it had a strong support in the House, yet it was\r\nyears before the principles embodied in the despatch of Lord John\r\nRussell were carried into full effect in New Brunswick.\r\n\r\n{OFFICIAL SALARIES}\r\n\r\nWhen the Civil List Bill was passed in 1837, the salaries of the public\r\nofficials which were provided for in it were placed on a very liberal\r\nscale. The lieutenant-governor was to receive £3,500 sterling, or almost\r\ndouble the present salary of the lieutenant-governor of New Brunswick.\r\nThe commissioner of Crown lands was to have £1,750 sterling, or about\r\nfive times as much as the present holder of that office; the provincial\r\nsecretary got £1,430 sterling, or more than three times as much as the\r\nsecretary of the province now receives. All the other salaries were in\r\nthe same proportion, and on a scale altogether beyond the means of the\r\nprovince. It was admitted by Lord Glenelg, when the arrangements were\r\nbeing made for the transfer of the casual and territorial revenues, that\r\nthese salaries might require modification, and he suggested that the\r\nlegislative council and the House of Assembly should at some future day\r\npresent him with their views on this subject. At the session of 1837, a\r\ncommittee of the House of Assembly, of which Wilmot was a member,\r\nreported in favour of a reduced scale of salaries, and this report was\r\nadopted by the House. During the same year, a committee of the council\r\nrecommended that the salary of the surveyor-general or commissioner of\r\nCrown lands should be reduced to twelve hundred pounds currency. This\r\nreduction was protested against by Mr. Baillie, who had held the office\r\nfor many years, but it was thought to be reasonable by Lord Glenelg. The\r\nexecutive council, however, took no steps to effect this reduction,\r\npossibly because Mr. Baillie himself was a member of that body. At the\r\ninstance of Mr. Wilmot, the matter was taken up by the House at the\r\nsession of 1839, and a strongly worded resolution passed censuring the\r\nexecutive council for not carrying into effect the reduction of the\r\nsalary of the surveyor-general, according to the views of Lord Glenelg.\r\nAt a later period in the same session, a committee, of which Wilmot was\r\nan active member, laid before the House a scale of salaries which they\r\nhad prepared and which they considered sufficient for the public\r\nofficials embraced in the civil list. Under this scale, the salary of\r\nthe surveyor-general was reduced to £600 currency, and that of the\r\nprovincial secretary to the same amount. This report was not accepted by\r\nthe House. There were strong interests working for the retention of the\r\nexisting salaries, and it was not until a much later period that the\r\nsalaries of the public officials were placed on a footing that agreed\r\nin some measure with the means of the province.\r\n\r\nAt the session of 1842, Wilmot was an active member of a committee which\r\nwas appointed to take into consideration the subject of fees and\r\nemoluments of the public officers, and at a later period in the session\r\nthey made a report recommending that all fees should go into the\r\ntreasury of the province and that all public officers should receive a\r\ncertain fixed salary. They presented with their report a scale of\r\nsalaries which they considered sufficient, which gave the provincial\r\nsecretary, surveyor-general and attorney-general each six hundred\r\npounds. Bills were introduced for the purpose of carrying these\r\nrecommendations into effect, but, although passed by the House, they\r\nwere rejected by the council, which for many years was the graveyard of\r\nall measures for the improvement of the province.\r\n\r\n{RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT}\r\n\r\nThe general election of 1842 was mainly fought on the Reform issue, and\r\nthe question of responsible government was discussed on every hustings.\r\nUnfortunately very few of the candidates who offered their services as\r\nlegislators had a clear idea of what responsible government really\r\nmeant, and some of the gentlemen who were not ashamed to confess their\r\nignorance of the principles of the British constitution were men of\r\neducation and position, from whom better things might have been\r\nexpected. Mr. Robert L. Hazen, an eminent lawyer, who was a candidate\r\nfor the representation of the city of St. John, declared in his\r\nnomination speech that he never met with any one who could explain to\r\nhim satisfactorily what responsible government meant. Mr. Humbert, one\r\nof the candidates for St. John County, was entirely averse to the new\r\nprinciples. \"And what,\" he asked, \"are these principles?\" \"Why,\" he\r\nwould ask, \"should the old system be altered; it had never given cause\r\nfor complaint, it had always worked well,--then why should the people\r\ncomplain?\" He was not in favour of any innovations on British colonial\r\ngovernment. Very few people understood what responsible government\r\nmeant. He hardly understood it himself. It was, in his opinion, just\r\nintroducing another branch into our government. He was not in favour of\r\nthe government initiating the money votes. He was always sensitive about\r\nthe rights of the House--to them ought the power of originating the\r\nsupplies to belong, and to none other--and if returned he would oppose\r\nthe measure.\r\n\r\nSuch absurdities as the above would not be worth quoting, but for the\r\nlight they throw on the views of the average New Brunswick politician of\r\nthat period. Mr. Humbert had been for many years a member of the House\r\nof Assembly, and yet he had been unable to understand the significance\r\nof the changes which the Reformers proposed in the constitution of the\r\ncountry. The result of the election in St. John showed that the people\r\nof that city and county were quite indifferent to the new doctrines.\r\nFor the county, Mr. Partelow was at the head of the poll, and that\r\ngentleman on the hustings had declared that he was opposed to any change\r\nin the constitution. He went into the House, he said, under a\r\nconstitution of fifty years' standing, and he was determined to leave it\r\nas he found it, unimpaired. He disapproved of the initiation of money\r\nvotes being placed in the hands of the executive. He thought \"such a\r\nsystem would be wrong and pernicious in the extreme.\"\r\n\r\n{REFORMERS DEFEATED}\r\n\r\nWhen the legislature met in January 1843, it was found that the\r\nReformers were in the minority. Mr. Partelow was determined to make this\r\nfact very clear, for in nominating the speaker he made a speech of some\r\nlength in which he declared that the time had come for testing the\r\nprinciples on which the House should act, and with this object in view\r\nhe would throw down the gauntlet to the friends of responsible\r\ngovernment by nominating Mr. J. W. Weldon, to fill the chair. This\r\ngentleman was a very fit representative of the old system, for besides\r\nbeing a member for Kent, he filled almost all the offices in that county\r\nwhich one man could hold. He was postmaster of Richibucto, deputy\r\ntreasurer for the port of Richibucto, issuer of marriage licenses for\r\nthe county of Kent, keeper of the seals and clerk of the peace and of\r\nthe inferior court of common pleas, and registrar of probates for the\r\nsame county.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilmot was nominated for the speakership by Mr. Hill, of Charlotte,\r\nbut declined to run; the odds were too great, and so Mr. Weldon, the\r\nopponent of responsible government, was elected without opposition. This\r\nwas an unsatisfactory result after so many years of conflict, but the\r\nfriends of Reform, although they had to admit defeat, were neither\r\ndaunted nor discouraged. They knew that many other questions besides the\r\nabstract one of the adoption of responsible government had influenced\r\nthe recent election, and that the new principles had been blamed for\r\nresults that would have been avoided if they had been in operation. For\r\ninstance, the transfer of the casual and territorial revenues to the\r\ntreasury of the province in 1837 had placed a very large sum, amounting\r\nto £150,000, at the disposal of the legislature. All this money had been\r\ndissipated by extravagant grants, and in 1842 the province was actually\r\nin debt. Many ignorant electors were made to believe that this result\r\nwas due to the Reformers who had been the means of obtaining this money,\r\nwhich the legislature had squandered; and this feeling was so strong in\r\nthe county of York, that Messrs. Wilmot and Fisher stood lower on the\r\npoll than the two anti-Reformers who were elected with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE READE APPOINTMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough elected in opposition to responsible government, the\r\nlegislature of 1843 at its first session took one important step in\r\nfavour of Reform. The arrangement by which the executive and legislative\r\ncouncils were separated, which had come into force ten years before,\r\nalthough a decided improvement on the old state of affairs, did not\r\nproduce universal satisfaction.[3] The constitution of the legislative\r\ncouncil was complained of, and it was described as an obstructive body\r\nwhich disregarded the wishes of the people. Bills of the utmost\r\nimportance, which had been passed by large majorities in the House of\r\nAssembly, and which were demanded by the people, were frequently\r\nrejected by the council without being even discussed. Most of its\r\nmembers were opposed to any change in the constitution of the province,\r\nand everything which seemed to be in the direction of giving power to\r\nthe people was denounced as an innovation and condemned as an\r\ninfringement of the vested rights of the council. One of the chief\r\ncauses of complaint against the council was their rejection of every\r\nbill for the amendment of the charter of King's College. Wilmot had so\r\nfrequently had his efforts in this direction nullified by the council\r\nthat he introduced a resolution in the assembly condemning the conduct\r\nof that body for rejecting the college bill, and the council retaliated\r\nby unanimously voting this a breach of privilege.[4] The complaints of\r\nthe House of Assembly against the legislative council were now embodied\r\nin an address to the queen. In this address it was stated that in the\r\nopinion of the House the legislative council should be composed of\r\npersons not only representing all the leading interests of the province,\r\nbut so independent in respect to property and so free from official\r\ncontrol as to form a constitutional check on the executive. Although, by\r\nthe laws that existed then, members of the assembly were required to be\r\npossessed of real estate to the value of two hundred pounds, over and\r\nabove all encumbrances, there was no property qualification whatever\r\nrequired for members of the legislative council. The address of the\r\nHouse expressed the opinion that members of the council should be\r\nrequired to possess a certain amount of real estate, and that their\r\nseats should be vacant on the loss of this qualification, or on their\r\nbecoming bankrupt, or public defaulters, or from neglect to give their\r\nattendance for a given time without leave of the lieutenant-governor.\r\nThe address also stated that the constitution of the legislative council\r\nwas defective and objectionable in other respects, because, of the\r\neighteen members who composed it, a great proportion held offices at the\r\npleasure of the Crown, and the principal officers of the government\r\nusually formed a majority of the members present. It was also complained\r\nthat members of the Church of England had too great a preponderance in\r\nthe council, the only members not of that communion being one\r\nPresbyterian and one Baptist.\r\n\r\n{THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL}\r\n\r\nAt the next session of the legislature, despatches from Lord Stanley\r\nwere laid before the House of Assembly in which it was stated that the\r\ncouncil would be increased in number to twenty-one, and four new members\r\nof the council were to be appointed. The new members then appointed were\r\nT. H. Peters, Admiral Owen, William Crane and George Minchin, while the\r\nHon. Thomas Baillie, the surveyor-general, the Hon. Mr. Lee, the\r\nreceiver-general, the Hon. James Allanshaw, of St. Andrews, and the Hon.\r\nHarry Peters, of Gagetown, retired. No doubt the retirement of two\r\nofficials who received large salaries was some improvement, but the\r\ncouncil required further remodelling before it could be said to be an\r\nefficient body, or one in sympathy with the inhabitants of the\r\nprovince.\r\n\r\nThe legislative council has now ceased to exist, and it may be said of\r\nit that it was never a very satisfactory body for legislative purposes.\r\nPerhaps the original composition of it created such a prejudice against\r\nlegislative councils as to hamper its activities; and, from having been\r\nat first merely the echo of the wishes of the governor, it became\r\nlatterly, to a large extent, the echo of the wishes of the government.\r\nGradually it became relieved of its official members, and in its last\r\nyears no head of a department ever occupied a seat in the legislative\r\ncouncil; for it was thought, and rightly, that the power ought to be in\r\nthe House, where the responsibility to the people was most felt, and\r\nthat it was not wise to place an official whose department expended\r\nlarge sums of money in a body which properly had no control over the\r\npublic expenditure. The legislative council had undoubtedly from time to\r\ntime many able and useful members, and, at certain periods in the\r\nhistory of the province, particularly during the confederation\r\ndiscussions, it took a firm stand in favour of measures which seemed\r\nessential to the prosperity of the British North American provinces. No\r\none can deny that at that time it exercised an authority fully equal to\r\nthat of the Lower House, but it cannot be doubted that some of this work\r\nwas done at the expense of the proper balance of the constitution. Such\r\nan exercise of unusual authority on the part of a body not elected by\r\nthe people may serve a purpose at a particular crisis, but cannot be\r\ncommended as an example, and if frequently repeated would end in the\r\ndestruction of the constitution.\r\n\r\n{THE COUNCIL'S RECORD}\r\n\r\nThe legislative council lost a considerable proportion of its able men\r\nat the time of confederation by the removal of eleven of its members to\r\nthe senate of Canada, although one or two remained with it who were not\r\ninferior to any of those who then took their departure. The new members\r\nwho came in as their successors were naturally inferior to the old in\r\npractical experience and ability, and this had, no doubt, an influence\r\non the future of the House. The example of Ontario, which was able to\r\nconduct its affairs with one House, showed that two independent branches\r\nof the legislature were by no means necessary, and that the council\r\nmight be abolished with safety. No doubt it was difficult to bring this\r\nabout among a people who had been trained to believe that there was\r\nsomething essential to legislation in the balance of king, lords, and\r\ncommons, making up one legislative body. But in the course of time the\r\nelectors began to think that the council was not exactly the proper\r\nequivalent of the House of Lords, and the lieutenant-governor very far\r\nfrom standing in the position of a king. Old prejudices in favour of a\r\nconstitution framed after a particular model are difficult to remove,\r\nbut, in the case of New Brunswick, these prejudices were at length\r\novercome, and it is safe to say that in the course of time all the\r\nprovincial legislatures of Canada will consist of but a single chamber.\r\nIt is equally safe to assert that under the new system the work of\r\nlegislation will be as well done as it was under the old.\r\n\r\nThe session of the legislature in 1843 came to an end on April 11th, and\r\non the seventeenth of the same month Wilmot became a member of the\r\ngovernment. His appointment had been preceded by the resignation of five\r\nmembers of the government--Messrs. Black, Shore, Robinson, Odell and\r\nCrane--and by the appointment of Messrs. E. B. Chandler, Hugh Johnston,\r\nJohn Montgomery and Robert L. Hazen, to fill the vacancies thus created.\r\nOf the retiring members two--Messrs. Black and Shore--were members of\r\nthe legislative council; one of them, Mr. Crane, was a member of the\r\nHouse of Assembly, while the other two were officials who did not belong\r\nto either branch of the legislature. Of the new members of the executive\r\ncouncil, Messrs. Chandler and Johnston were members of the legislative\r\ncouncil, Messrs. Hazen and Wilmot were members of the House of Assembly,\r\nwhile Mr. Montgomery had no seat in either House. The executive council\r\nas made up at that time included four members of the legislative\r\ncouncil, three members of the House of Assembly and Mr. Montgomery, who\r\ndid not become a member of the House of Assembly until three years\r\nlater. There is no doubt that the composition of the new executive\r\ncouncil was more in accordance with correct principles than its\r\npredecessor; yet little could be expected from it in the way of Reform,\r\nfor Wilmot was the only member who was in favour of responsible\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n{ENTERS THE GOVERNMENT}\r\n\r\nMr. Wilmot has been censured for entering a government composed of men\r\nwho were opposed to the liberal views he held on public questions. It\r\nwas thought by many that his conduct in this respect looked too much\r\nlike a surrender of his principles for the sake of office or official\r\nposition, and it certainly would have been better if he had continued in\r\nOpposition. Yet we can easily conceive that he may have thought at the\r\ntime he could do more for the cause of Reform inside the government than\r\nout of it, and, although this proved to be an error, it was a natural\r\none for which it is not difficult to find an excuse. Fortunately for the\r\ncause of Reform, Wilmot's connection with the government did not last\r\nlong at that time. A storm was gathering in an unexpected quarter which\r\nwas destined to wreck the government, and to cause some of its\r\nConservative members to reconsider their opinions with reference to some\r\nquestions which until then they had regarded as fixed and unchangeable.\r\n\r\nIt has been already stated that the governor of the province made such\r\nappointments to office as he pleased, usually without the advice of his\r\ncouncil. He was supposed to have the power to do this as the\r\nrepresentative of the sovereign and in the exercise of what was termed\r\n\"the royal prerogative.\" In this way persons were frequently appointed\r\nto offices who were not residents of the province, and in all other\r\ncases appointments were given to the members of certain favoured\r\nfamilies. In 1834, a vacancy was created on the supreme court bench by\r\nthe death of Chief-Justice Saunders. Ward Chipman was appointed\r\nchief-justice in place of Mr. Saunders, and the vacant puisne judgeship\r\nwas given to James Carter, who afterwards became chief-justice of the\r\nprovince. Carter was a young Englishman then living in London, and was\r\ncertainly no better qualified to fill the position of judge than many\r\nnatives of the province, so that it was regarded as a gross insult to\r\nthe members of the New Brunswick bar, to give such an appointment to a\r\nstranger. Yet so slow was public opinion to make itself felt in regard\r\nto the evil of the appointing power being given to the governor without\r\nqualification, that ten years later the House of Assembly presented an\r\naddress to Sir Charles Metcalfe, governor-general of Canada, expressing\r\nthe high sense entertained by them, as representatives of the people of\r\nNew Brunswick, of the \"constitutional stand\" taken by him in maintaining\r\nthe prerogative of the Crown in the then recent memorable \"conflict.\"[5]\r\nThe city of St. John also, to show its loyalty, presented a similar\r\naddress; and one signed by one thousand persons was sent from the county\r\nof York.\r\n\r\n{SIR CHARLES METCALFE}\r\n\r\nYet nothing can be more clear than that the stand taken by Sir Charles\r\nMetcalfe in 1844 was wholly wrong, for it consisted in refusing to\r\nconsult with his council in regard to appointments, and in making\r\nappointments contrary to their advice. What would the people of Canada\r\nsay to-day to a governor-general who insisted on appointing men to\r\noffice against the advice of his cabinet? Yet it was for doing this that\r\nthe New Brunswick House of Assembly, the city and county of St. John and\r\nthe county of York actually grovelled in the dust before this despotic\r\ngovernor, thus approving of all his acts. Such abasement and\r\nsubserviency to an unconstitutional governor was certain to bring its\r\nown punishment, and it came much sooner than any one could have\r\nanticipated. On Christmas Day of the same year the Hon. William Franklin\r\nOdell, who had been provincial secretary for thirty-two years, died at\r\nFredericton. Mr. Odell's father had been secretary before him from the\r\nfoundation of the province, so that the Odell family had held that\r\nimportant and highly lucrative office for sixty years.\r\n\r\nThe governor at this time was Sir William Colebrooke, and on January\r\n1st, 1845, just one week after the death of Mr. Odell, he appointed his\r\nson-in-law, Alfred Reade, who was a native of England and a stranger to\r\nthe province, to the vacant office. The gentlemen who had been most\r\nprominent in shouting their approval of the \"constitutional stand\" taken\r\nby Sir Charles Metcalfe, now suddenly discovered that Sir William\r\nColebrooke's conduct in making this appointment without consulting his\r\ncouncil, was a fearful outrage, and their distress was pitiable to\r\nbehold. Several members of the government, including such zealous\r\nupholders of the prerogative as the Hon. Robert L. Hazen, of St. John,\r\nat once resigned their positions. A communication from three of\r\nthem--Hugh Johnston, E. B. Chandler and R. L. Hazen--addressed to His\r\nExcellency gave as their reasons for resigning that they could not\r\njustify the exercise of the prerogative of the Crown in respect to Mr.\r\nReade's appointment, because they felt that \"the elevation to the\r\nhighest offices of trust and emolument of individuals whose character,\r\nservices, and claims to preferment, however appreciated elsewhere, are\r\nentirely unknown to the country generally, is prejudicial to the best\r\ninterests of the province.\" They did not, however, make it a ground of\r\nobjection that the appointment of Mr. Reade was forwarded for the royal\r\napprobation without the advice or concurrence of the council. These\r\ngentlemen evidently thought it was too early for them to eat the words\r\nin regard to the prerogative of the Crown, of which they had been so\r\nfree a few months before, but they showed their true characters by\r\ndeserting the governor because he had been foolish enough to believe\r\nthat their profuse expressions in favour of the royal prerogative were\r\nsincere.\r\n\r\n{RESIGNATION}\r\n\r\nMr. Wilmot, who also resigned, sent a separate communication to the\r\nlieutenant-governor in which he stated what he considered to be the true\r\nconstitutional doctrine which should govern such matters. He said:--\r\n\r\n\"In the first place, I consider it justly due to the people of this\r\nprovince, that all the offices of honour and emolument in the gift of\r\nthe administration of the government should be bestowed upon inhabitants\r\nof the province who have made this country their home, and, in the cases\r\nof the principal offices, those persons should be preferred who have\r\nclaims for public services rendered to the province, and who can command\r\nthe respect and confidence of the country. With these views, which I\r\nhope I shall ever retain, I must necessarily disapprove of the\r\nappointment in question, as I can only look upon Mr. Reade as a\r\ncomparative stranger and a transient person, while, at the same time, I\r\nam of opinion that he has no claim whatever on the ground of public\r\nservices rendered to this province.\r\n\r\n\"It would be in vain for the parents of our youth to make every exertion\r\nin order to qualify their sons for the higher offices of the province,\r\nif the avenues to honourable and profitable preferment are to be thus\r\nclosed against them; and I therefore cannot but view the appointment\r\nunder consideration as an act of great injustice to the people of this\r\ncountry; and I can safely assure Your Excellency that it will be thus\r\nconsidered throughout the length and breadth of the province.\r\n\r\n\"Your Excellency is well aware that ever since I have had the honour of\r\nhaving a seat in the council, I have approved of, and advocated those\r\nprinciples of colonial government which are now in full operation in\r\nCanada, which have been distinctly enunciated by the present government\r\nin the House of Commons, and which require the administration to be\r\nconducted by heads of departments responsible to the legislature, and\r\nholding their offices contingently upon the approbation and confidence\r\nof the country as expressed through the representatives of the people.\r\nStill entertaining a strong attachment to those principles from a clear\r\nconstitutionality, and, from a conscientious belief in their safe and\r\npractical adaptation to a British colony enjoying the privileges of a\r\nrepresentative form of government, I can see no sufficient reason for\r\nwithholding their salutary influence from the loyal and intelligent\r\npeople of this province; and considering it more advisable that a\r\ngradual advancement should be made by the government itself towards\r\nthose principles as opportunities may offer, than that a concession in\r\ngross should hereafter be made to the urgent demands of the country, I\r\nam of the opinion that the provincial secretary should now be brought\r\ninto the executive government, and should hold a seat in one of the\r\nHouses of the legislature--his tenure of office being contingent upon\r\nthe successful administration of the government; and therefore, as the\r\nappointment in question has been made irrespective of any of these\r\nconditions, I am bound to give it my opposition.\"\r\n\r\n{REMONSTRANCE OF THE ASSEMBLY}\r\n\r\nWhen the House met in the latter part of January, the Reade appointment\r\nimmediately became the subject of discussion, and by the vote of\r\ntwenty-four to six, an address was passed to Her Majesty the Queen,\r\ncondemning the appointment, not, as the members said, because they\r\nquestioned \"in the remotest degree the prerogative in its undoubted\r\nright to make such appointments,\" but because they thought that the\r\nright of appointment had been improperly or unjustly exercised. In other\r\nwords, the members of the House of Assembly surrendered the principle\r\nthat appointments should be made by the governor, with the advice of\r\nhis executive, and only objected to the Reade appointment because, in\r\ntheir opinion, some one else should have been chosen. It is easy to see\r\nthat in subscribing to this address the members of the House stultified\r\nthemselves; for if it was a part of the prerogative of the Crown to make\r\nappointments without the advice of the council, surely the exercise of\r\nthe prerogative in the appointment of a particular individual could not\r\nbe fairly questioned. The result of the difficulty, however, was the\r\ncancelling of Mr. Reade's appointment by the home government. This\r\ndecision was communicated to the House of Assembly by message on\r\nFebruary 3rd, 1846. The despatch from the colonial office, upon which\r\nthe lieutenant-governor acted, was written on March 31st, 1845, and must\r\nhave been received by him at Fredericton not later than the last of\r\nApril. But notwithstanding this despatch Mr. Reade held office until\r\nJuly 17th, so it will be seen that Sir William Colebrooke was in no\r\nhurry to carry out the wishes of the home government. Lord Stanley, the\r\nwriter of the despatch in question, expressed the opinion that public\r\nemployment should be bestowed on the natives or settled inhabitants of\r\nthe province, and he thought that Mr. Reade did not come under this\r\ndescription. He closed his despatch with the following singular\r\nstatement:--\r\n\r\n{READE'S APPOINTMENT CANCELLED}\r\n\r\n\"I observe with satisfaction that the House of Assembly have not only\r\nabstained from complicating the subject with any abstract question of\r\ngovernment, but have rejected every proposal for laying down formal\r\nprinciples upon such questions. The House has, I think, in this course\r\ndone justice to the earnest desire of Her Majesty that the colonial\r\nadministration generally should be conducted in harmony with the wishes\r\nof her people, whatever may be the variations arising out of local\r\nconsiderations and the state of society in various colonies, subject to\r\nwhich that principle may be carried into practice; and it is anxiously\r\nhoped that the same wise forbearance which has led the House of Assembly\r\nto decline the unnecessary discussion of subjects of so much delicacy,\r\nmay lead them also to regard the practical decision now announced as the\r\nfinal close of the controversy, and to unite in the promotion, not of\r\nobjects of party strife and rivalry, but of the more substantial and\r\nenduring interests of the colony which they represent.\" If these words\r\nhave any meaning, they seem to show that at that date the British\r\ngovernment believed the right of appointment to be in the Crown, without\r\nreference to the council, and that they were unwilling that any general\r\nprinciple should be laid down by the legislature of the province which\r\nconflicted with this view.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[3] This change had been effected by a royal commission under the signet\r\nand sign-manual dated December 3d, 1832. There is nothing in the records\r\nof the province to show why this was done. Neither the council nor the\r\nHouse of Assembly had asked for it. The Nova Scotia council was not\r\ndivided until 1838.\r\n\r\n[4] Mr. Wilmot's resolution was carried in the assembly without a\r\ndivision, so that he had the solid support of the popular branch of the\r\nlegislature, yet little good was to be expected from such votes in the\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n[5] The resolution to present this address was strongly opposed by Mr.\r\nWilmot and his colleague, Mr. Fisher, who both declared the conduct of\r\nLord Metcalfe to be contrary to the principles of responsible\r\ngovernment. Mr. Wilmot's speech led to a singular result. He was\r\nattacked in the _Loyalist_ newspaper for his opposition to the address,\r\nand this attack having been brought to the notice of the House of\r\nAssembly was voted a breach of privilege. Messrs. Doak and Hill, the\r\nproprietors of the paper, were arrested on the warrant of the speaker\r\nand committed to prison. On the application of their counsel, Mr. D. S.\r\nKerr, they were released by Mr. Justice Carter on a writ of _habeas\r\ncorpus_. Doak and Hill both brought actions against the speaker, Mr.\r\nWeldon, and the result was a decision of the Supreme Court of New\r\nBrunswick that the House of Assembly had not the power to arrest and\r\nimprison the publisher of a libel on a member of the House touching his\r\nconduct and proceedings in the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nWILMOT'S VIEWS ON EDUCATION\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the questions in which Wilmot took a deep interest was that of\r\neducation. His views on this subject were far in advance of those of\r\nmost of his contemporaries. Education was in a very unsatisfactory\r\ncondition in the province of New Brunswick when he entered public life,\r\nand it continued in that condition for many years afterward. If we may\r\njudge from the statute-book, the founders of the province had very\r\nlittle appreciation of the advantages of education, for no law was\r\npassed with a view to the establishment of public schools until the year\r\n1805. In that year \"An Act for encouraging and extending literature in\r\nthis province\" was passed, under the provisions of which a public\r\ngrammar school was established in the city of St. John, which received a\r\ngrant of one hundred pounds for the purpose of assisting the trustees to\r\nprocure a suitable building for school uses, and also an annual grant of\r\none hundred pounds for the support of the master. The same Act provided\r\nfor the establishment of county schools, and the sections relating to\r\nthem, being limited in respect to time, were continued by 50th George\r\nIII, Chap. 33 to the year 1816, when they expired and were replaced by\r\n\"An Act for the establishment of schools in the province.\" This Act\r\nexpired in 1823, and in its place \"An Act for the encouragement of\r\nparish schools\" was passed the same year. This last Act was repealed by\r\n\"An Act in relation to parish schools\" passed in 1833, which continued\r\nin force for many years. All these Acts were essentially the same in\r\nprinciple, as they provided for government aid to teachers who had been\r\nemployed to teach schools in the parishes under the authority of the\r\nschool trustees. The Act of 1833, which was considered to be a great\r\nimprovement on former Acts, provided for the appointment of three school\r\ntrustees in each parish by the sessions, and these trustees were charged\r\nwith the duty of dividing the parishes into districts and directing the\r\ndiscipline of the schools. They were required to certify once a year to\r\nthe lieutenant-governor as to the number of schools in their parish, the\r\nnumber of scholars and other particulars, and on their certificate the\r\nteacher drew the government money. This money was granted at the rate of\r\ntwenty pounds for a male teacher who had taught school a year, or ten\r\npounds for six months, and ten pounds for a female teacher who had\r\ntaught school a year, or five pounds for six months, provided the\r\ninhabitants of the school district had subscribed an equal amount for\r\nthe support of the teacher, or supplied board, washing and lodging to\r\nthe teacher in lieu of the money. Thus a male teacher in a district\r\nwhere a school was always kept, would receive for his year's work his\r\nboard, lodging and washing, and twenty pounds in money; and a female\r\nteacher ten pounds. Such a rate of remuneration was not well calculated\r\nto attract competent persons, and the result was very unsatisfactory.\r\nMost of the teachers employed were old men who had a mere smattering of\r\nlearning and who were very incompetent instructors. They usually lodged\r\nwith the parents of the pupils, living at each house in proportion to\r\nthe number of scholars sent. This system, which raised them but one\r\ndegree above the condition of paupers, was not conducive to their\r\ncomfort or self-respect. As there was no uniformity in the books\r\nprescribed and no sufficient educational test, the results of such\r\nteaching were not likely to be satisfactory. Sometimes the teacher was a\r\nwoman who eked out a scanty subsistence by communicating her small\r\nlearning to a few scholars whom she gathered in her kitchen. Generally,\r\nhowever, the school building was a log hut without any of those\r\nappliances which are now regarded as essential to the proper instruction\r\nof youth.\r\n\r\n{PROVINCIAL GRAMMAR SCHOOLS}\r\n\r\nIn 1816 an Act was passed providing for the establishment of grammar\r\nschools in the several counties of the province. At that period St. John\r\nand St. Andrews had already grammar schools which had been established\r\nunder separate Acts, and Fredericton had an academy or college, which\r\nwas founded by a provincial charter granted by Lieutenant-Governor\r\nCarleton in 1800. The counties of St. John, Charlotte and York were\r\ntherefore excepted from the operation of the general Act for the\r\nestablishment of grammar schools. This Act, after being amended in 1823,\r\nwas finally repealed by the Act of 1829, which endowed King's College at\r\nFredericton and made new provisions for the establishment and support of\r\ngrammar schools throughout the province. King's College at a later\r\nperiod developed into the University of New Brunswick. It had its\r\nbeginning in the original charter of 1800, already referred to, which\r\nestablished the College of New Brunswick. In the same year the governor\r\nand trustees of the College of New Brunswick received a grant, under the\r\ngreat seal of the province, of a considerable tract of land in and near\r\nFredericton for the support of that institution of learning. Until the\r\nyear 1829, the New Brunswick College was merely a classical school\r\nreceiving from the legislature annually two hundred and fifty pounds,\r\nwhich was the same amount then allowed to the St. John Grammar School.\r\n\r\n{MADRAS SCHOOLS}\r\n\r\nAt an early period, the attention of the people of that province was\r\ndirected to what was called the Madras system of national schools as\r\nconducted by Dr. Bell, the real founder of the system being Joseph\r\nLancaster. This system depends for its success on the use of monitors,\r\nwho are selected from among the senior pupils to instruct the younger\r\nones. It was supposed at the time to be a notable discovery, but, like\r\nother short cuts to learning, has fallen out of favour. In July, 1818,\r\nthe first Madras school was established in St. John by a Mr. West from\r\nHalifax. This was a boys' school; and a school for girls, on the same\r\nsystem, was opened a year or two later. In 1819, a Madras school charter\r\nwas procured under the great seal of the province, and the Madras school\r\nsystem established on a substantial foundation. The province gave a\r\ngrant of two hundred and fifty pounds for the erection of a suitable\r\nbuilding in St. John, and the National Society in England contributed to\r\nits support. This charter was confirmed by an Act passed in 1820. The\r\nSt. John school was to be regarded as the central school, but it was the\r\ndesign of the charter that the benefits of the system should be extended\r\nto other parts of the province, and this was accordingly done. The\r\nMadras schools received liberal appropriations of money, and large\r\ngrants of land, and they continued to exist until the introduction of\r\nthe free school system in 1872. Two or three of them, indeed, continued\r\nin operation after that time, but they had lost their original character\r\nand had become simply Church of England schools, that denomination\r\nhaving appropriated the Madras school endowments to the support of\r\nschools in which its principles and creed were taught. In 1900, by Act\r\nof the legislature, the Madras school property was handed over to the\r\ndiocesan synod of Fredericton, with the exception of about ten thousand\r\ndollars, which went to the University of New Brunswick.\r\n\r\nFrom the day when Wilmot became a member of the House of Assembly in\r\n1835, he began to press upon the attention of that body the necessity\r\nfor an improvement in the schools of the province. But the same spirit\r\nof apathy which prevailed with regard to purely political questions\r\naffected the legislature with respect to education. The people\r\nthroughout the province were not prepared to make the sacrifices\r\nnecessary to obtain sufficient schools. Their attitude with regard to\r\neducation was well described in a speech made by Wilmot in 1846, when\r\nMr. Brown, of Charlotte, brought in his bill to provide for a normal or\r\nproper training school for the education of those who were to become\r\nteachers. This bill did not become law, in consequence of the opposition\r\nraised against it in the legislature on the ground of expense. It was\r\nestimated that it would cost an additional two thousand pounds to\r\nprovide a normal school, and this sum the men who were at the head of\r\nthe government were not willing to pay for the purpose of giving the\r\nchildren of the province properly trained teachers. Wilmot's speech on\r\nthat occasion concluded as follows:--\r\n\r\n{PARISH SCHOOLS}\r\n\r\n\"Before I sit down I must again revert to the greatest difficulty which\r\nhas to be encountered to render the provisions of that bill effective in\r\npromoting a better system of education in the parish schools. This is a\r\ndifficulty which in this country legislation cannot reach--I earnestly\r\nwish it could. I mean the apathy of the parents themselves. The\r\nhonourable member now in the chair can bear me witness as to the extent\r\nto which this apathy prevails in this county at this day. That\r\nhonourable member, when out of the chair, could tell the committee that\r\nin a certain district of this county where there is no schoolhouse, a\r\nphilanthropic individual told the inhabitants that if they would get out\r\na frame and provide the boards, he would at his own expense provide\r\nnails, glass, locks, and the necessary materials for finishing a\r\nschoolhouse. What was the result? They did get out the frame and raised\r\nit, and when I and the honourable chairman had occasion to visit that\r\npart of the county together, we enquired why they did not go on and\r\nfinish it. The worthy individual who had made the proposition, and\r\nbought and had in his house the materials for finishing the building,\r\ntold us that the inhabitants of the district would not find the boards,\r\nand, in consequence of that, the erection of the schoolhouse had not\r\nbeen gone on with. A gentleman now present (I will not mention names, as\r\nthe chairman might blush) offered to give them the boards from a\r\nneighbouring mill if they would go and fetch them, but even this they\r\nwould not do. Although everything was to be had without money, there was\r\nno one who felt interest enough in the education of their children to\r\ngo and bring them to the spot--and to this day the frame stands, as it\r\nthen did, a melancholy monument of the dreadful apathy which is\r\nsometimes to be found even in this comparatively intelligent county.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Wilmot lived long enough to see a free school system in force in his\r\nnative province, although he had no share in bringing this result about.\r\nYet that his views on this subject were sound and far in advance of his\r\ntime is shown by a speech which he made at the time of the opening of\r\nthe first exhibition in the province in 1852. He said:\r\n\r\n\"It is unpardonable that any child should grow up in our country without\r\nthe benefit of, at least, a common-school education. It is the right of\r\nthe child. It is the duty not only of the parent but of the people; the\r\nproperty of the country should educate the country. All are interested\r\nin the diffusion of that intelligence which conserves the peace and\r\npromotes the well-being of society. The rich man is interested in\r\nproportion to his riches, and should contribute most to the maintenance\r\nof schools. Though God has given me no child of my own to educate, I\r\nfeel concerned for the education of the children of those who do possess\r\nthem. I feel concerned in what so intimately touches the best interests\r\nof our common country. I want to hear the tax collector for schools\r\ncalling at my door. I want the children of the poor in the remote\r\nsettlements to receive the advantages now almost confined to their more\r\nfortunate brethren and sisters of the towns. I know full well that God\r\nhas practised no partiality in the distribution of the noblest of his\r\ngifts--the intellect; I know that in many a retired hamlet of our\r\nprovince--amid many a painful scene of poverty and toil--there may be\r\nfound young minds ardent and ingenious and as worthy of cultivation as\r\nthose of the pampered children of our cities. It is greatly important to\r\nthe advancement of the country that these should be instructed.\"\r\n\r\n{MONEY VOTES}\r\n\r\nThe initiation of money grants by the executive, and the responsibility\r\nof the latter to the people, are the two corner-stones on which\r\nresponsible government must rest. From the very first, Wilmot was an\r\nearnest advocate of both these measures; but, owing to the apathy of the\r\npeople and the disinclination of the members of the legislature to give\r\nup what they considered their privileges, it was a difficult matter to\r\naccomplish these objects. A reference to the journals of the legislature\r\nwill show that on numerous occasions he pressed these subjects on the\r\nattention of the House of Assembly, and he was ably assisted by his\r\ncolleague from the county of York, Mr. Charles Fisher, who deserves a\r\nforemost place among the men who should be honoured for their efforts to\r\nbring about responsible government in the colonies of British North\r\nAmerica. It was a peculiar feature in the struggle for responsible\r\ngovernment in New Brunswick that, before it ended, the opposition to it\r\ncame not so much from the British government as from the members of the\r\nprovincial legislature. It was evident that the system of appropriating\r\nmoney which existed in the House of Assembly was one which was wrong in\r\nprinciple and resulted in getting the province into debt, because there\r\nwas no guiding hand to control the expenditure. The transfer of the\r\ncasual and territorial revenues to the provincial treasury in 1837 had\r\nplaced a very large sum, amounting to about £150,000, at the disposal of\r\nthe legislature, but this sum was speedily dissipated; and in the year\r\n1842, when Sir William Colebrooke became lieutenant-governor of the\r\nprovince, its finances were in an embarrassed condition.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of 1841, a despatch was received from Lord Stanley,\r\nthe colonial secretary, suggesting that it was desirable that a better\r\nsystem of appropriating the funds of the province should be inaugurated.\r\nThis brought up a discussion in the legislature during the session of\r\n1842 in regard to the propriety of adopting the principle of placing the\r\ninitiation of money grants in the executive council. Mr. Wilmot moved a\r\nresolution in committee of the whole House \"that no appropriation of\r\npublic money should be made at any future session in supply, for any\r\npurpose whatever, until there be a particular account of the income and\r\nexpenditure of the previous year, together with an estimate of the sums\r\nrequired to be expended, as well for ordinary as extraordinary services,\r\nrespectively, and also a particular estimate of the principal amount of\r\nrevenue for the ensuing year.\" To this an amendment was moved by Mr.\r\nPartelow that \"Whereas the present mode of appropriation, tested by an\r\nexperience of more than fifty years, has not only given satisfaction to\r\nthe people of this province, but repeatedly attracted the deserved\r\napprobation of the colonial ministers as securing its constitutional\r\nposition to every branch of the legislature, therefore resolved, as the\r\nopinion of this committee, that it is not expedient to make any\r\nalteration in the same.\" This amendment was carried by a vote of\r\neighteen to twelve.\r\n\r\n{AN ABUSE UPHELD}\r\n\r\nSuch an amendment as that passed by the House of Assembly of New\r\nBrunswick in 1842 would now only be an object of ridicule, because, as a\r\nmatter of fact, the financial condition of the province showed that the\r\nsystem of appropriation which prevailed was based on false principles,\r\nwhile the alleged approval of the colonial ministers of which so much\r\naccount was made, had been extended to the most illiberal features of\r\nthe constitution. There was, however, some excuse for the reluctance of\r\nthe members of the House of Assembly to surrender the initiation of\r\nmoney votes to the executive, because the executive council of that day\r\nwas not a body properly under the control of the legislature, or in\r\nsympathy with the people.\r\n\r\nWhen the House met in 1843, it was seen that the friends of responsible\r\ngovernment were still in the minority. Yet they brought up the subject\r\nof the appropriation of the public moneys by a resolution which sought\r\nto fix the responsibility of the expenditure on the government. This was\r\nmet by an amendment moved by Mr. J. W. Weldon, that the House would not\r\nsurrender the initiation of the money votes. The amendment was carried\r\nby a vote of twenty-four to seven, which showed that the friends of\r\nReform had still much leeway to make up before they could hope to\r\nimpress their views upon the legislature.\r\n\r\n{SPEECH ON APPROPRIATIONS}\r\n\r\nAs it was hopeless to expect that a House of Assembly thus constituted\r\nwould vote in favour of the transfer of the initiation of money grants\r\nto the executive, Wilmot did not bring up the subject again during the\r\nremainder of its term; but by the operation of the Quadrennial Act,\r\nwhich came into force in 1846, a new House was elected in that year,\r\nwhich was largely made up of the same members as the previous one, and\r\nat the first session of this House, held early in 1847, Wilmot, during\r\nthe discussion of the revenue bill, brought up the question of the\r\ninitiation of money grants in a vigorous and characteristic speech. He\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n\"Can my honourable gentlemen tell me within five thousand pounds of the\r\nmoney asked for, or required for the present session? No, they cannot,\r\nand here we are going on in the old way, voting money in the dark, with\r\na thing for our guide called an 'estimate'--a sort of dark lantern with\r\nwhich we are to grope our way through the mazes of legislation. Where is\r\nthe honourable member for Gloucester who talked so much about the good\r\nold rules of our forefathers? I am opposed to the present principle of\r\nvoting away money; it is, in fact, but giving to tax and taxing to give,\r\nthis way and that way--every stratagem is used which can be invented in\r\norder to carry favourite grants, and thus we proceed from day to day by\r\nthis system of combination and unprincipled collusion. [Cries of 'Order,\r\nOrder!'] Honourable members may cry order as much as they please, it is\r\ntrue, and I care not who knows it--let it go forth to the country at\r\nlarge. This system is what the honourable and learned member for\r\nGloucester [Mr. End] denominates 'the glorious old principles of our\r\nforefathers,' which should be held as dear as life itself. It is not now\r\nas in times gone by, when the legislative council and executive council\r\nwere one, and consequently we cannot now take the initiation of money\r\ngrants. This left the whole power in the hands of the assembly; and now,\r\nwith the report of the committee of finance before us, His Excellency's\r\nmessages, petitions and everything else, there is not one honourable\r\nmember around these benches can tell me within five thousand pounds of\r\nthe amount to be asked for, much less within ten thousand pounds of the\r\namount that will be granted during the present session; and yet, here we\r\nare in committee of ways and means for raising a revenue. But it will\r\nnever answer to have too much information upon this point--if we knew\r\nexactly how far we could go and no farther--I perhaps would lose my\r\ngrant, or another honourable member might lose a grant; this is the\r\nsystem that is pursued. I have held a seat here for twelve years and\r\nknow the 'ropes' pretty well.\"\r\n\r\nIn the following year there was another discussion on the initiation of\r\nmoney grants, arising out of a despatch which had been received from\r\nEarl Grey, then colonial minister, in which he referred to the laxity of\r\nthe system by which money was voted in the New Brunswick legislature\r\nwithout any estimate, and suggested that the initiation of money grants\r\nshould be surrendered to the executive. This proposal was fiercely\r\nopposed, and all the forces of ancient Toryism were rallied against it,\r\none member from Queens County, Mr. Thomas Gilbert, going so far as to\r\napply to the advocacy of the old rotten system the soul-stirring words\r\ncontained in Nelson's last signal at Trafalgar, \"England expects that\r\nevery man this day will do his duty.\"\r\n\r\n{END'S RESOLUTION}\r\n\r\nIn 1850, the last year that Mr. Wilmot sat in the House of Assembly, the\r\nmatter came up again on a resolution moved by a private member. This\r\nwas met by an amendment moved by Mr. End, of Gloucester, in the\r\nfollowing words:--\r\n\r\n\"WHEREAS, the right of originating money grants is inherent in the\r\nrepresentatives of the people who are constitutionally responsible to\r\ntheir constituents for the due and faithful user of that right;\r\ntherefore,\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, As the opinion of this House, that the surrender of such\r\nright would amount to a dereliction of public duty and ought not to be\r\nentertained by the House of Assembly.\"\r\n\r\nThis was carried by a vote of sixteen to eleven. The three members of\r\nthe government who sat in the House, one of whom was Mr. Wilmot, who had\r\njoined it in May 1848, voted with the minority. It was not until the\r\nyear 1856 that a resolution was passed by the House of Assembly\r\nconceding to the executive the right of initiating money grants, and\r\nthis was carried by a majority of only two in a full House. The first\r\nestimate of income and expenditure framed by a New Brunswick government\r\nwas not laid before the House of Assembly until the session of 1857.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE DEMAND FOR RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Wilmot first entered the House of Assembly, many of the members\r\nwere office-holders and therefore depended on the goodwill of the\r\ngovernor for their positions. At the session of 1842, a bill was\r\nintroduced for the purpose of putting an end to this evil, in which it\r\nwas declared that any member of the House of Assembly who should accept\r\nthe office of executive councillor or any office of profit or emolument\r\nunder the Crown should be incapable of taking or holding his seat in the\r\nGeneral Assembly while in such office, unless reëlected after acceptance\r\nthereof. An amendment was moved to exempt executive councillors who did\r\nnot hold any office of emolument from the provisions of this section,\r\nbut it was lost by a close vote. Mr. Wilmot voted for the amendment on\r\nthe ground that a man who was merely an executive councillor without\r\noffice, and who received no emolument as such, should not be required to\r\ngo back to the people for reëlection. The bill, nevertheless, was passed\r\nby a full House, but it was disallowed by the home authorities on the\r\nground that it was not in accordance with British precedents. The\r\ncolonial secretary said, \"This Act as actually drawn would therefore\r\nseem to establish a principle of great importance as well as\r\nnovelty--the principle, namely, that the Crown may not select its own\r\nconfidential advisers from amongst representatives of the people unless\r\nthe person so chosen should be willing to hazard a new election. How far\r\nit is wise to erect such a barrier between the executive government and\r\nthe popular branch of the legislature would seem to be a matter well\r\nmeriting serious consideration.\" In the same despatch, the propriety of\r\nseats in the assembly being vacated for the same reasons which would\r\nvacate seats in the House of Commons was fully conceded. The stand taken\r\nby Wilmot in regard to this subject was therefore the one which was\r\napproved by the home government and was further endorsed by subsequent\r\nlegislation. Yet it was not until 1849 that the Act was passed which\r\nfinally settled the question, and required members of the legislature\r\naccepting office to vacate their seats in the House of Assembly and go\r\nback to their constituents for reëlection.\r\n\r\n{THE GOVERNOR CENSURED}\r\n\r\nSir William Colebrooke had not been a popular governor since the\r\nappointment of his son-in-law to the office of provincial secretary. The\r\nHouse of Assembly, therefore, was disposed to watch his conduct very\r\nclosely and to criticize actions which perhaps would not have attracted\r\nso much attention under other conditions. During the session of 1846, it\r\nwas shown that he had appropriated a portion of the surplus civil list\r\nfund, amounting to about three thousand pounds, for the purpose of\r\ndefraying the expenses of surveying Crown lands in Madawaska.[6] This\r\nmoney was taken by the order of the colonial secretary, Lord Stanley.\r\nThus it appeared that, although the province was supposed to have the\r\ncontrol of the territorial revenue, the British government assumed the\r\nright to dispose of a portion of this revenue without the consent or\r\nauthority of the House of Assembly. The conduct of the governor in\r\nconnection with this matter was censured in a strongly worded resolution\r\nwhich was passed by the House of Assembly almost unanimously.[7] The\r\ntime had gone by when the representative of the Crown could do as he\r\nliked with the public funds of the province, as had been the case in\r\nformer years.\r\n\r\nThe legislature was dissolved in 1846 under the provisions of the Act\r\nwhich limited its term to four years. On the last day of the session\r\nWilmot bade farewell to the members of the House, and stated that he did\r\nnot intend to offer himself again for reëlection. No doubt he was quite\r\nsincere in making this statement at the time, but he soon had reason to\r\nchange his mind. The people of the county of York were unwilling to lose\r\nthe services of the champion of their rights in the House of Assembly,\r\nso that he found it necessary to consent to be again nominated. He was\r\nreturned at the head of the poll, and with him Mr. Charles Fisher, who\r\nhad been his colleague in two previous legislatures.\r\n\r\nThe general election of 1846 brought a considerable number of new men\r\ninto the House, and in point of liberality the new assembly was a slight\r\nimprovement on its predecessor. The legislature met near the end of\r\nJanuary in the following year. The government at that time consisted of\r\nonly five persons, of whom two were members of the House of Assembly and\r\nthree of the legislative council. It appeared that negotiations had been\r\ngoing on with some of the members of the Opposition for the purpose of\r\nfilling up the vacancies in the executive council. Wilmot had been\r\noffered a seat in that body, but made it a condition of his acceptance\r\nthat he should go in with two of his friends, provided the council was\r\nfilled up to the number of seven, or three, if filled up to the number\r\nof nine. This was not agreed to, so he remained outside the government.\r\nDuring the first week of the session three new members were added to the\r\ngovernment, one of them being the surveyor-general, Mr. Baillie, who had\r\nbeen elected a member of the House of Assembly for the county of York.\r\nThe arrangements made were not satisfactory to Wilmot and his friends,\r\nand the government had to face what was practically a want of confidence\r\nresolution. It was moved by Mr. Fisher and was as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, As the opinion of this House, that while it fully\r\nrecognizes the accountability of the executive council to the assembly,\r\nit will expect that henceforth the provincial administration will, from\r\ntime to time, prepare and bring before the legislature such measures as\r\nmay be required for the development of the provincial resources and the\r\ngeneral advancement of the public interests.\"\r\n\r\n{ASSAILS THE GOVERNMENT}\r\n\r\nIn the course of the debate Wilmot spoke with great power and effect.\r\nThe following report of his speech on that occasion may serve to convey\r\nto the reader some idea of his manner and method as a public speaker:--\r\n\r\n{SPEECH ON REFORM}\r\n\r\n\"The honourable gentleman might have spared himself the trouble of\r\nmaking the defence he did. I have heard that he was to be presented with\r\na gold medal for his admirable defence of that nearly extinct race--the\r\nold Family Compact. I see that I shall have to cross a lance with my\r\nhonourable and learned friend [Mr. Hazen] politically. Yet I hope the\r\nsame good feeling which has characterized the debate thus far will be\r\ncontinued. A great deal has been said about politics and political\r\nprinciples, but my political principles are not of yesterday--I have\r\ngleaned them from the history of my country, a country which we are all\r\nproud to own. Will any honourable member dare to tell me that because we\r\nare three thousand miles from the heart of the British empire the blood\r\nof freemen shall not flow through the veins of the sons of New\r\nBrunswick? If so, I have yet to learn the reason. Before I sit down I\r\nwill endeavour to show my honourable friends what the distinction is\r\nbetween Liberals and Conservatives--what the Liberals have done, and\r\nwhat the Conservatives have not done. Now to the resolution. My\r\nhonourable friend said yesterday that the resolution meant initiation of\r\nmoney grants. When this announcement was made I heard a shout from the\r\ndirection of my honourable friend, Mr. Partelow, in a tenor voice, and\r\nan honourable member in the rear [Mr. Barberie] joining in a sort of\r\nfalsetto accompaniment. I think my honourable friend [Mr. Hazen] is much\r\nto blame for having accused his honourable colleague [Mr. Woodward] with\r\nwriting an article in a city paper. What, suppose he did write it, do\r\nnot some of the first noblemen and statesmen in England write for the\r\npapers? I will not deny that I have written for the papers myself some\r\nlittle squibs. But it is wrong to place an honourable member in the\r\nposition where he will have to affirm or deny it. A great cry has been\r\nraised of a contemplated attack on the government, and, after all, it\r\nhas turned out that their fears have been excited by a newspaper\r\nparagraph. The government has fortified all their outposts, and His\r\nExcellency and two aides have been on the lookout for the coming attack.\r\nAt length my honourable colleague [Mr. Fisher] brought forth his\r\nresolutions when they said to each other, 'Why, this doesn't mean\r\nanything; there is no attack.' But they slept over it one night, cracked\r\nsome wine upon it, and while sitting under the mahogany they\r\nsaid--'Hazen, there is something in these resolutions of Fisher's,\r\ndepend upon it--some hidden meaning--what shall we say it is? what will\r\nwe call it? we must give them some ugly name, or they will pass.' 'Oh,'\r\nsaid Hazen, 'I have it--initiation of money grants--that'll do; I'll\r\njust go down to the House and cry out \"mad dog,\" \"initiation of money\r\ngrants\"; members will become alarmed, and we'll succeed in defeating\r\nthem.' But the honourable member from St. John [Mr. Jordan] has made the\r\nmost wonderful discoveries; he has taken a peep from the lookout station\r\nat the enemy; he has looked through a political microscope, and has\r\ndiscovered more than the commander-in-chief himself. 'Why,' says he,\r\n'there's everything there--I see \"free trade\" and \"protection\" both, and\r\nlet me see--I--there's the \"Board of Works,\" too; and round on the other\r\nside I see \"Municipal Corporations.\"' I will endeavour before I sit down\r\nto prove that the arguments of my honourable friend Mr. Hazen are\r\nfallacious. He has been developing at a great rate yesterday; he was not\r\nasked to develop the money, but to bring down such measures as would\r\ndevelop the provincial resources; this is the meaning of the resolution,\r\nand, had not my honourable friend become alarmed for the safety of the\r\ngovernment, there is no man into whose hands I would sooner place the\r\nresolution. But he has chosen to put the construction upon the\r\nresolution which he has done, and other honourable members said, 'Oh, he\r\nknows what it means better than I do; he has cried \"mad dog\" and we'll\r\nfollow him.' The government is not asked to bring in the revenue bill,\r\nor any other bill which involves the principle of money grants. All the\r\nresolution requires is, that they shall be prepared, at the opening of\r\nthe session, with such measures as may be considered for the general\r\nwelfare of the country, and not keep the assembly waiting two or three\r\nweeks for the motion of the government, as has been the case this\r\nsession. Honourable members will recollect that there is a constituency\r\nbehind them to whom they are accountable; but they may resolve and\r\nre-resolve as they please. There is a spirit of inquiry abroad among the\r\npeople, a political intelligence, which was not to be found a few years\r\nsince when my honourable friend denounced responsible government as all\r\nnonsense! What was the case when responsible government was first talked\r\nof in this province? Who descended from their lofty eminence to warn the\r\npeople to beware of these new doctrines? The old official Family Compact\r\nparty--they who entrenched themselves behind the prerogative of the\r\nCrown in 1836, came down to the people and said, 'We who have done so\r\nmuch for you--we who have watched over and guarded you, beware of that\r\ndreadful monster, responsible government.' These are the people who call\r\nthemselves Conservatives. What, I would ask, did they conserve?\r\nEverything but the good of the country; and, had the Conservatism of\r\n1836 been carried out, an insulted people would ere this have risen in\r\ntheir majesty and would have shaken off the yoke of bondage under which\r\nthey had been labouring.\r\n\r\n{RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT}\r\n\r\n{THE PEOPLE SUPREME}\r\n\r\n\"It has been said by honourable members of the government that there is\r\nno distinction between Liberals and Conservatives. If this is the case,\r\nwhy did they object to have me and two others take seats in the council\r\nbecause we were Liberals? Here is a question which I would like my\r\nhonourable friends to answer. The Conservatives do not wish to see any\r\npower in the hands of the people. [Interjection from Mr. End--'Not too\r\nmuch.'] The honourable member from Gloucester, Mr. End, has receded from\r\nhis principles wonderfully; his speech yesterday was certainly a most\r\nextraordinary one. He said to the government in a most supplicating tone\r\nof voice, 'Give me fair play--give me the appointment of all the\r\nbye-road commissioners, magistrates, sheriffs, and so on, in Gloucester,\r\nand I will support you; that is all I want.' I will take care not to be\r\nmisunderstood in these matters, I will not allow any man to be the\r\nexponent of my political principles. I believe departmental government\r\nto be inseparable from our institutions, but will oppose the immediate\r\nintroduction of the whole system; I will bring it in step by step as the\r\ncountry is prepared for it. Some extraordinary notions are entertained\r\nas to the source from whence the power of the government is derived; the\r\nfreedom of government does not come down from the Crown, it goes up from\r\nthe people; and if the people are fit for these institutions they are\r\nfit for self-government. I have frequently said that they who get the\r\npeople's money shall do the people's work. [From Mr. Partelow--'Yes,\r\nthat's right.'] I will now come down a step further--what was the case\r\nin 1837? I am not going to disclose any secrets this time--but will\r\nspeak low. I wish to ask my honourable friend [Mr. Hazen] if, after the\r\nadministration changed in 1837, the government had the cordial\r\ncoöperation of the heads of departments? No! There has been a\r\ncounter-working going on--a constant endeavour to lead the government\r\nastray and place them in a wrong position, and my generous-hearted\r\nfriend [Mr. Hazen] has to come down to this House and defend them. It is\r\na political fact, that previous to 1841 the heads of departments in this\r\nprovince were in open hostility to the government. [From Mr. End--'They\r\ncould do no harm.'] If the departmental system were in operation, and\r\ntheir tenure of office depended upon their ability so to conduct the\r\ngovernment as to merit the confidence of the assembly and the people,\r\nthere would be none of this stabbing in the dark, and running off the\r\ntrack. It is, in my opinion, the only constitutional remedy for the good\r\nworking of the government. These five gentlemen who have lately formed\r\nthe mixed government, asked for departmental government when they signed\r\nthe address to the queen; yet now they refuse to adopt it. I should like\r\nto know when they intend to graduate--does it depend upon the age of the\r\ncountry or the state of the atmosphere? The fact is, whenever the people\r\nof this country, through their representatives, choose to ask for it\r\nthey must get it. In 1844 they ran to the rescue of the prerogative in\r\nCanada; but the very next year the same case came down to their own\r\ndoors! The tune was changed then, and an address was prepared to the\r\nqueen signed by the whole assembly except five. Why is this brought\r\nabout--why is the tune changed so suddenly? They at first said\r\nresponsible government is not fit for a colony--the next cry was, it is\r\nnot fit for New Brunswick, and finally they said, when they addressed\r\nthe queen--we must have it. Mr. Roebuck called upon Lord John Russell to\r\nexplain what responsible government was, which he has done [reads the\r\nspeech as delivered in the British parliament], and, when they had first\r\nasked for it here, it was in full operation in Canada. My honourable\r\nfriend [Mr. Hazen] has accused me of having receded; but I will now ask\r\nhim to point out how I have done so? He has also said that I was brought\r\nforward at the last election by the Conservatives. True, but I was\r\nbacked by all my old friends, and I told them if they took me, they must\r\ndo so with all my former opinions--opinions which I never will give up.\r\nWhen they talk about there being no difference in political\r\nnames,--there is a difference; those who have contended for Liberal\r\nprinciples have their names covered with obloquy. We ask for a\r\nconstitution that, while it protects the queen upon the throne, throws,\r\nat the same time, its paternal arms around the helpless infant. This we\r\nask for, this we want--the pure, the free, the glorious constitution of\r\nEngland; for this we have contended, for this the Liberals of New\r\nBrunswick have fought, and let them call us rebels who have nothing else\r\nto write about, I care not; we ask for a system that will give fair play\r\nto all--that will upset all Family Compacts, and give to the sons of\r\nNew Brunswick their birthright, the benefit of free institutions and\r\nself-government. This is what we want, and I will not submit tamely to\r\nbe called a rebel; I defy any honourable member to look at my political\r\nlife and say where I have overstepped the bounds of the constitution? If\r\nI do live three thousand miles from the great body of the empire, still\r\nthat empire sends its blood through the veins of every British subject.\r\nA son of New Brunswick has the same right to the benefit of her\r\ninstitutions as has a resident of London, and I will not submit to be\r\ncut off by any political man[oe]uvring.\"\r\n\r\n{REFORM DEFEATED}\r\n\r\nAfter a long debate, Mr. Fisher's resolution was defeated by a vote of\r\ntwenty-three to twelve, which showed that the friends of Reform had\r\nstill much work to do.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[6] This occurred during the time of the \"rump\" government composed of\r\nMessrs. Simonds, Allen and McLeod, the members of the executive who\r\nrefused to resign at the time of the Reade appointment.\r\n\r\n[7] The following resolutions which were moved by Mr. Partelow were\r\ncarried in the House of Assembly by a vote of twenty to two:\r\n\r\n\"1st. _Resolved_, That this committee deeply regret that His Excellency\r\nthe lieutenant-governor in council should not have felt himself\r\nauthorized to communicate to the House the despatch of the Right\r\nHonourable the Secretary of State for the Colonies, of January 5th,\r\n1845, relative to the appropriation of the surplus civil list, in answer\r\nto the address of the House of Assembly of March 14th, 1845, whereby the\r\nHouse was prevented from representing, by an humble and dutiful address\r\nto Her Majesty, that such appropriation was not in accordance with the\r\ndespatch of the Right Honourable the Secretary of State for the Colonies\r\nof August 31st, 1836.\r\n\r\n\"2d. _Resolved_, As the opinion of this committee, that any funds\r\nnecessary to carry out the fourth article of the Treaty of Washington,\r\nbeing a national treaty with a foreign power, ought not to be chargeable\r\nupon the funds of this province; and that the House should, by an humble\r\nand dutiful address to Her Majesty, pray that any appropriation made for\r\nthat purpose from the surplus civil list fund may be refunded to the\r\nsame.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE VICTORY IS WON\r\n\r\n\r\nThe session of 1848 was destined to be a memorable one in the history of\r\nresponsible government in New Brunswick. It was evident that with the\r\nHouse as then constituted no progress could be made unless a change were\r\nbrought about in the views of some of its members by outside pressure.\r\nIn this instance the pressure came from the imperial government, which\r\ndesired to bring the political condition of New Brunswick into line with\r\nthat of Canada and Nova Scotia. In March, 1847, Earl Grey, the colonial\r\nsecretary, addressed a despatch to Sir John Harvey, the governor of Nova\r\nScotia, in which he laid down the principles which he thought should\r\ncontrol colonial administration. The most important feature of this\r\ndespatch was its declaration with reference to the composition of the\r\nexecutive council. With regard to office-holders in general, Earl Grey\r\nthought that they ought not to be disturbed in consequence of any change\r\nof government, but he was of opinion that a different rule should apply\r\nto such officials as were members of the executive council. On this\r\npoint he adopted the language of Mr. Poulett Thomson (Lord Sydenham),\r\nwho, in a despatch to Lord John Russell, written at Halifax, in the\r\nyear 1840, said:--\r\n\r\n\"The functions of the executive council, on the other hand, are, it is\r\nperfectly clear, of a totally different character; they are a body upon\r\nwhom the governor must be able to call at any or at all times for\r\nadvice, with whom he can consult upon the measures to be submitted to\r\nthe legislature, and in whom he may find instruments within its walls to\r\nintroduce such amendments in the laws as he may think necessary, or to\r\ndefend his acts and his policy. It is obvious, therefore, that those who\r\ncompose this body must be persons whose constant attendance on the\r\ngovernor can be secured; principally, therefore, officers of the\r\ngovernment, but, when it may be expedient to introduce others, men\r\nholding seats in one or other House, taking a leading part in political\r\nlife, and above all, exercising influence over the assembly.\r\n\r\n\"The last, and in my opinion by far the most serious, defect in the\r\ngovernment is the utter absence of power in the executive, and its total\r\nwant of energy to attempt to occupy the attention of the country upon\r\nreal improvements, or to lead the legislature in the preparation and\r\nadoption of measures for the benefit of the colony. It does not appear\r\nto have occurred to any one that it is one of the first duties of the\r\ngovernment to suggest improvements where they are wanted; that, the\r\nconstitution having placed the power of legislation in the hands of an\r\nassembly and a council, it is only by acting through these bodies that\r\nthe duty can be performed; and that, if these proper and legitimate\r\nfunctions of government are neglected, the necessary result must be not\r\nonly that the improvements which the people have a right to expect will\r\nbe neglected, and the prosperity of the country checked, but that each\r\nbranch of legislature will misuse its power, and the popular mind be\r\neasily led into excitement upon mere abstract theories of government to\r\nwhich their attention is directed as the remedy for the uneasiness they\r\nfeel.\"\r\n\r\nHe concluded by expressing the opinion that the peculiar circumstances\r\nof Nova Scotia presented no insuperable obstacle to the immediate\r\nadoption of that system of parliamentary government which had long\r\nprevailed in the mother country.\r\n\r\n{A MEMORABLE DESPATCH}\r\n\r\nA copy of this despatch was sent to the lieutenant-governor of New\r\nBrunswick and it was laid before the House in pursuance of an address\r\nwhich had been passed a few days before. It was understood that the\r\nprinciples laid down in this despatch would be equally applicable to the\r\nprovince of New Brunswick, and Mr. Fisher moved that the House should\r\napprove of them and of their application to New Brunswick. This\r\nresolution was carried by a vote of twenty-four to eleven, which was a\r\ncomplete reversal of the vote of the previous session. Among those who\r\nvoted for the resolution were the three members of the government who\r\nhad seats in the House of Assembly and who had been previously opposed\r\nto any such change in the political system of the country. Thus the\r\nvictory for responsible government was practically won, and it only\r\nremained to perfect the details.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the prorogation of the legislature, a reorganization\r\nof the government took place, Messrs. Baillie, Shore and Johnston\r\nretired and their places were taken by Messrs. Wilmot, Partelow, Fisher\r\nand Kinnear. Mr. Wilmot became attorney-general in the place of Mr.\r\nPeters, recently deceased, who had filled that office for twenty years.\r\nMr. Partelow became provincial secretary in place of John Simcoe\r\nSaunders. Mr. Kinnear, who had been made solicitor-general in 1846, now\r\nbecame a member of the government under the new system, while Mr. Fisher\r\ntook his seat as a member of the government without office. Thus were\r\nthe principles of responsible government vindicated and established in\r\nNew Brunswick. The provincial secretary, the attorney-general and the\r\nsolicitor-general became political officers subject to change with every\r\nchange of government. The surveyor-general, Mr. Baillie, by resigning\r\nfrom the government escaped this condition for the time being, but it\r\nwas not long before that office also became political, Mr. Baillie\r\nhimself retiring with a pension in 1851.\r\n\r\n{INFLUENCE OF COLONIAL OFFICE}\r\n\r\nMessrs. Wilmot and Fisher were much censured by their friends for\r\nbecoming members of a government that was essentially Conservative and\r\nin which they were in a minority. But as the principles for which they\r\nhad contended had been admitted and were now in a measure established,\r\nthere seemed to be no reason why they should not assist in working them\r\nout. Wilmot as attorney-general certainly had greater opportunities of\r\nadvancing the cause of Reform than as a private member, and he and\r\nFisher working together were able to exercise a strong influence on the\r\nadministration. In the following year, as has already been seen, a\r\nmeasure was carried voiding the seats of members of the assembly who\r\nbecame heads of departments in the government, or enjoyed any office of\r\nprofit or emolument under the Crown, and this was all that was necessary\r\nto establish responsible government on a firm basis. There was indeed\r\none other difficulty, the interference of the colonial office and the\r\ninfluence of the governor, who had been accustomed to govern the\r\nprovince largely by means of despatches. This influence was one which\r\ncould only be got rid of by degrees, for the wise men of Downing Street\r\nalways thought they knew much better what colonists required than did\r\nthe colonists themselves. The colonial secretary undertook to dictate to\r\nthe province as to the kind of tariff it should pass, and to refuse\r\nassent to the passage of bills by the legislature giving a preference\r\nto any particular county or granting bounties to fishermen or others\r\nengaged in any special calling. It was felt to be a hardship that the\r\nprovince was not permitted to give encouragement to any industry which\r\nit desired to assist, and so strong was this feeling that at the session\r\nof 1850, immediately after the receipt of a despatch from Earl Grey\r\ndisallowing the bill of the previous session granting bounties for the\r\ncultivation of hemp, a bill was introduced and carried by an\r\noverwhelming majority in the assembly appropriating three thousand\r\npounds for bounties to fishermen. This bill was rejected by the council,\r\nso that the colonial secretary was spared the difficulty which would\r\nhave been involved in being defied by the New Brunswick legislature. It\r\nwas also felt to be a great hardship that, at a time when the colonies\r\nwere being deprived of the preferential tariff they had so long enjoyed\r\nin the English markets, they should be debarred from entering into\r\ncommercial arrangements with foreign nations. A series of strongly\r\nworded resolutions on this subject was moved by Mr. David Wark, and was\r\nwell supported, although not carried. The language used by many of the\r\nspeakers during the debate showed that the loyal feelings which had\r\nalways distinguished the people of the province were being subjected to\r\na severe strain by the policy of the British government. These\r\ninterferences with provincial rights continued for many years after\r\nWilmot had retired from public life, and therefore it is unnecessary to\r\nrefer to them further.\r\n\r\n{THE PORTLAND CONVENTION}\r\n\r\nWilmot had but few opportunities during his active career as a public\r\nman of displaying his abilities outside of his native province. His fame\r\nas an orator was therefore mainly a local one, and the Portland Railway\r\nConvention of 1850 was the first occasion on which he was recognized as\r\none of the best speakers on the continent. That great gathering of the\r\nrailway and business men of the United States and Canada was assembled\r\nfor the purpose of taking measures to secure a shorter ocean route to\r\nEurope than was afforded by steamships sailing from New York. It was\r\nthought that a better plan would be to run steamships from some port on\r\nthe west coast of Ireland to a port on the east coast of Nova Scotia, a\r\ndistance of about two thousand miles, and to connect the latter with New\r\nYork by a line of railway. No one doubted at that time that this was a\r\nplan that was likely to succeed, and probably it would have done so if\r\nthere had been no improvement in the construction of steamships. No one\r\ndreamed in those days that boats with a speed of twenty-five knots an\r\nhour and of twenty thousand tons displacement would be running to New\r\nYork before the century was ended, and that the voyage to Liverpool\r\nwould be reduced to less than six days.\r\n\r\nThe Portland Convention included many eminent men from the United States\r\nand Canada and not a few that could justly be described as orators, but\r\nit was universally admitted that in eloquence Attorney-General Wilmot,\r\nof New Brunswick, exceeded them all. The reporter of the proceedings of\r\nthe convention stated, in the pamphlet afterwards published, that it was\r\ndue to the speaker and to himself to say that \"he had been entirely\r\nunable to give anything like a report of the remarks of Mr. Wilmot.\" The\r\nreporter also quotes the statement of another that \"Mr. Wilmot delivered\r\none of the most spicy, eloquent and enlivening speeches which he ever\r\nheard, which, while it kept the audience in the best spirits, was\r\nreplete with noble sentiments commending themselves to the hearts of all\r\npresent. His remarks were generally upon the moral, social and\r\nintellectual influences which would result from the contemplated work.\r\nNo sketch would do justice to its power and beauty, its flashes of wit\r\nand humour.\"\r\n\r\n{WILMOT'S GREAT SPEECH}\r\n\r\nThe following report of Wilmot's great convention speech, although\r\nadmittedly very imperfect, is given as almost the only example that\r\nsurvives of his eloquence:--\r\n\r\n\"I find myself in a new position in addressing a convention in a city,\r\nin a state, and under a government that is foreign to me, as far as\r\ncitizenship is concerned. But I feel myself at home, for I am among\r\nthose who derive their inheritance from the same common ancestry. I am,\r\nMr. President, not a son of New England, but a grandson, and I can find\r\nthe old gravestone which indicates the graves of my ancestors, in a\r\npleasant village of Connecticut [cheers].\r\n\r\n\"We in the provinces came to this convention at your call. We have\r\nresponded to your invitation and you have given us a brother's welcome.\r\nPhysiologists affirm that the exercise of the muscles tends to their\r\nenlargement and fuller development; and phrenologists affirm that the\r\nexercise of the different faculties develops in a corresponding degree\r\nthe bumps upon the cranium. I would beg to add something to this\r\ncategory,--the exercise of benevolence and kindness enlarges the heart,\r\nand since I have been among you I have felt my heart growing big within\r\nme [cheers].\r\n\r\n\"I am delighted to see this day, and could I give expression to the\r\nemotions which swell up within me I would do so, but my power fails in\r\nthe attempt, and I cannot presume to make a speech. We do not, however,\r\nmeet to consult about California, where one hundred and twelve hour\r\nspeeches are necessary, or about the admission of New Mexico into the\r\nUnion. Our object is to effect an admission into the great railroad\r\nunion, and on this question we admit of no 'compromises.' We go straight\r\nahead in our purpose and the union will be effected [cheers].\r\n\r\n\"I know, Mr. President, it is a great work in which we are engaged. I\r\nknow that it looks vast, if not impossible of achievement to those who\r\nhave not studied its relations and its details, but those who look at it\r\nthrough the enlarged medium which its contemplation presents will find\r\nthat difficulties diminish as its importance grows upon their vision.\r\n\r\n\"Look at the progress of similar enterprises among yourselves in the\r\nstate of Maine, and other parts of New England, and then say whether\r\nanything is required of us but union of effort and faith in the result\r\nof our exertions. In prosecuting our work in this matter, we must have\r\nfaith; but as faith without works is dead, let us put forth our\r\nexertions and go steadily forward to a speedy and glorious completion of\r\nour great enterprise [cheers].\r\n\r\n\"If the timid falter and the doubting hold back, there are others who\r\nwill take their places and keep our ranks full. We have only to hold our\r\nposition, and drive back the army of doubters, or opposers, who may\r\nresist our march. We must give them the same reception that General\r\nTaylor gave to the army of Santa Anna at Buena Vista. If opposed by\r\nsuperior numbers, or if on any part of the field there are those who\r\nhesitate, or hold back when a stronghold of the enemy is to be carried,\r\nI would repeat the order of General Taylor: 'A little more grape,\r\nCaptain Poor'[8] [tremendous cheers].\r\n\r\n\"It is written in the decrees of eternal Providence, Mr. President,\r\nthat we shall learn war no more; we may then go on side by side with\r\nglorious emulation for the cause of virtue and philanthropy throughout\r\nthe world, striving who shall out-vie the other. How changed in every\r\nrespect, now, is the condition of our race! How glorious the sight of\r\ntwo great peoples uniting as one, 'to draw more closely the bands of\r\nbrotherhood, that yet shall make of all mankind but one great\r\nbrotherhood of nations.' The sentiment of that resolution which embodies\r\nthis idea is worthy of its author and of the American character; but it\r\nis also a sentiment to which the people of the British empire will\r\nrespond [cheers].\r\n\r\n\"Sir, I found in the circular which invited us here this sentiment\r\nexpressed, in terms which aroused to the fullest enthusiasm the mind of\r\nevery man in the British provinces: 'The spirit of peace has at last\r\nprevailed--national animosities, sectional and political hostility have\r\ndisappeared between the English races since the establishment of the\r\nboundaries of Maine and Oregon, and the contests of war have been\r\nsucceeded by a noble and generous rivalry for the promotion of the arts\r\nof peace. The introduction of the steamship and the railway has made\r\nformer enemies friends. National hostility has given way to commercial\r\nand social intercourse, and under whatever form of government they may\r\nhereafter exist, they can never again become hostile or unfriendly'\r\n[cheers].\r\n\r\n\"To this sentiment I respond with all my heart. It is this sentiment\r\nthat has brought us together. I know not who was the author of this\r\ncircular, but whoever he may be, in the name of every Englishman--in the\r\nname of every American, sir, in the name of humanity, I tender him\r\nthanks [cheers].\r\n\r\n\"An enterprise aiming to accomplish such results, and which is in and of\r\nitself calculated to produce such results, cannot fail of success. The\r\nwhole civilized world is interested in its accomplishment. There are\r\nsome good old-fashioned people who think we are going too fast and too\r\nfar in our railroad enterprises. We have, they say, lived and got along\r\nwell enough without railroads, and now you seem to think that your\r\ntemporal salvation depends upon it! Blot out your telegraphs, lay up\r\nyour steamboats,--what darkness would come upon the world! We must form\r\nourselves into a council of war for the purpose of combating these old\r\nprejudices, and, instead of being turned away from our objects, we will\r\ntake stronger grounds than ever occupied before.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. President, we of the provinces have made up our minds no longer to\r\nremain quiet in our present condition. With all the fine natural\r\nadvantages our country possesses, we make comparatively slow progress,\r\nand our province itself is scarcely known to the world. I shall be\r\npardoned here for relating an anecdote to illustrate the truth of this\r\nremark.\r\n\r\n\"In a recent visit to Washington upon official business, I had occasion\r\nto tarry a few days in the city of New York, and among the places that I\r\nvisited with a friend was one of the colleges in the city. My friend\r\nintroduced me to a learned professor as his friend, the\r\n'Attorney-general of New Brunswick.' We entered into conversation on a\r\nvariety of subjects, and he inquired when I came over to the city, and\r\nas to various matters going on in the neighbouring state. Seeing the\r\nmistake of the learned professor, I thought it hardly kind to mortify\r\nhim by correcting it, and I answered in the best way I could, and took\r\nmy leave; and to this hour, I suppose, the learned professor thinks he\r\nwas talking with the attorney-general of the fine old state of New\r\nJersey [tremendous cheers].\r\n\r\n\"Seeing that my own country itself was hardly known beyond its bounds, I\r\nfelt a little concern that she should not always remain in this\r\ncondition. I felt, as many of my friends and neighbours have long felt,\r\nthat we must look at home for the means of making our province honoured\r\nand respected abroad. And we intend to open this line of railway\r\nentirely across the breadth of our province and bring ourselves into\r\nconnection with the world [cheers].\r\n\r\n\"Mr. President, I cannot omit, in this connection, the expression of my\r\nprofound regard for the American Union. It is the union of these states\r\nthat has given you greatness and strength at home and the respect and\r\nadmiration of the civilized world [long-continued cheers].\r\n\r\n\"The great interests of Christianity, of philanthropy and of liberty,\r\nthroughout the world, depend upon the union of these states. We of New\r\nBrunswick, of Nova Scotia, and of Canada are deeply interested in its\r\nexistence. If there is any question of the day that interests us more\r\nthan all others, it is this very question of the perpetuity of the\r\nunion. For myself, I think there should be passed a law providing that\r\nthe man who would even conceive the idea of a dissolution of the union\r\nshould be guilty of treason. In the sincerity of my heart, I say, perish\r\nthe man who should dare to think of it [tremendous cheers]!\"\r\n\r\nWith respect to railway legislation Wilmot was not in advance of many\r\nothers in the province whose general political views were less liberal\r\nthan his own. There was always a good deal of local feeling injected\r\ninto the discussion of railway matters and Wilmot, who was a resident of\r\nFredericton, incurred a good deal of censure for the ridicule which he\r\nthrew on the proposal to build a railway from St. John to Shediac, which\r\nis now a part of the Intercolonial. As this railway brought the counties\r\nbordering on the Straits of Northumberland and the Gulf of St. Lawrence\r\ninto easy communication with St. John, nothing is more clear than that\r\nof all the railways then projected in the province it was the one most\r\nlikely to be useful and profitable, but Wilmot apparently could not\r\nforget the fact that it did not touch his own county. His speech on this\r\nsubject was made in the legislature before the meeting of the Portland\r\nConvention, and it is worthy of note that five-sixths of the Shediac\r\nRailway was to be used as part of the magnificent European and North\r\nAmerican Railway scheme which was so much lauded by him in his Portland\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\n{HIS WORK IN LEGISLATION}\r\n\r\nThere is not much to be said in regard to the political life of Wilmot\r\nafter he became attorney-general. His principal legislative achievement\r\nwhile he filled that office was an Act for the consolidation of the\r\ncriminal law with regard to the definition of certain indictable\r\noffences and the punishment thereof. This was a useful but not a\r\nbrilliant work, which many another man might have performed equally\r\nwell. In the session of 1850, Wilmot carried a bill through the House of\r\nAssembly for the reduction of the salaries of the judges of the supreme\r\ncourt and some other officials, but this measure did not pass the\r\nlegislative council. He had always been in favour of a low scale of\r\nsalaries as best suited to the conditions which prevailed in the\r\nprovince. The scale had been fixed in 1836, when the casual and\r\nterritorial revenues were placed under the control of the province, but\r\nan agitation soon afterwards commenced for further reductions. The\r\nimperial government would not consent to the reduction of any salary\r\nwhile the holder of the office lived, except in the case of the\r\nsurveyor-general, whose duties had been decreased, but it agreed to a\r\nlower scale for future occupants of the offices. In this way the salary\r\nof the provincial secretary had been reduced from £1,599 11s. to £600;\r\nthat of the surveyor-general from £2,019 4s. 4d. to £1,209 12s. 4d., and\r\nthat of the auditor-general from £500 to £346 3s. The salaries of the\r\njudges, however, remained the same in 1850 as they had been in 1836,\r\nviz., £1,096 3s. for the chief-justice and £750 for each of the puisne\r\njudges. Wilmot's bill reduced these salaries to £700 for the\r\nchief-justice and £600 to each of the other judges. He also voted for a\r\nresolution in favour of making the legislative council elective, and\r\nthat an address should be presented to Her Majesty asking her to consent\r\nto the passage of such a bill. A favourable answer was received from Her\r\nMajesty, but the scheme to make the legislative council elective was\r\nnever carried into effect, in consequence of the opposition which it\r\nencountered in that body.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the popularity of Wilmot seriously declined after\r\nhe entered the government. This was very plainly seen at the general\r\nelection which took place in June, 1850, when he narrowly escaped\r\ndefeat, being the lowest on the poll of the members elected, while his\r\ncolleague in the government, Mr. Fisher, was defeated, polling less than\r\none-half the number of votes given to the candidate who was highest on\r\nthe poll. But, on the whole, the result throughout the province was\r\nfavourable to the cause of Reform, and among those elected in York who\r\nstood higher on the poll than Wilmot were two new members who held\r\nadvanced views with respect to the amendment of the constitution.\r\n\r\n{THE GOVERNOR AND THE JUDGES}\r\n\r\nAlthough responsible government had been conceded to New Brunswick, and\r\nit was admitted that public offices should be bestowed in accordance\r\nwith the wishes of the people, the close of Wilmot's legislative career\r\nwas marked by an event which showed that the old order of things had not\r\nentirely passed away. Chief-Justice Chipman, owing to failing health,\r\nresigned his seat on the bench in the autumn of 1850, and it became\r\nnecessary to provide for a successor. A meeting of the executive council\r\nwas called for the purpose of filling the vacancy, and six members of\r\nthe council out of the eight who were present signed a memorandum to the\r\neffect that it was not advisable to appoint any person to the vacant\r\noffice, but that such a division of the work of the judiciary should be\r\nmade by the legislature as would secure the efficient discharge of the\r\njudicial duties by three judges, together with the Master of the Rolls.\r\nWilmot was one of the persons who signed this memorandum, but on the\r\nfollowing day he called on the governor and asked that his name might be\r\nwithdrawn from it, he having in the meantime apparently changed his\r\nmind. The governor, Sir Edmund Head, asked the judges whether, in their\r\nopinion, three of them would be able to do all the judicial business of\r\nthe country, and received from them a strongly worded protest against\r\nany such alteration in the number of judges. Mr. Fisher, who was one of\r\nthe members of the executive present at the meeting, submitted to the\r\ngovernor a paper in which he took strong grounds against the proposal to\r\nreduce the number of judges. Sir Edmund Head referred the matter to the\r\nhome authorities, and they decided that the proposed change in the\r\nnumber of judges was not advisable. Moreover, they decided as to who\r\nshould fill the vacant offices, and asked the governor to appoint Mr.\r\nJustice Carter to the position of chief-justice and to offer a puisne\r\njudgeship to the attorney-general, Mr. Wilmot, and if he refused it to\r\nthe solicitor-general, Mr. Kinnear. Mr. Wilmot accepted, and thus\r\nbrought his political career to an end.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[8] This is an adaptation of General Taylor's words. John A. Poor was\r\nthe chief promoter of the European and North American Railway and the\r\nchairman of the committee of arrangements of the Portland Convention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nJUDGE AND GOVERNOR\r\n\r\n\r\nThe opinion that was entertained of Mr. Wilmot by those who were closely\r\nassociated with him in the work of Reform was well expressed by the late\r\nMr. George E. Fenety, in his _Political Notes_.\r\n\r\n\"A great luminary,\" says Mr. Fenety, \"set in semi-darkness on the day\r\nthat Mr. Wilmot left the forum for the bench. He was the light of the\r\nHouse for sixteen years, the centre from whence radiated most of the\r\nsparkling gems in the political firmament. It was at a time of life\r\n(comparatively a young man) and a period when talents such as his were\r\nmost wanted by his party and his country. Notwithstanding his supposed\r\nmistake in having joined a Conservative government, the Liberals were\r\nalways willing to receive their old leader back with outstretched\r\narms--ready to forgive and go along again with him over the old road,\r\nand, to a man, would have held to him had he made a stand against Sir\r\nEdmund Head, and told him--'thus far and no farther shalt thou go'.\"\r\n\r\nMany of Wilmot's friends regretted that he should have accepted the\r\noffice of judge on the conditions under which it was offered. They\r\nthought that as attorney-general he was entitled to the position of\r\nchief-justice, and that in consenting to take the puisne judgeship he\r\nhad lowered himself. It is hardly necessary to discuss a question of\r\nthis kind at the present day. No doubt he had reasons of his own for\r\nretiring from the arena of politics. The work he had been doing for the\r\npublic had placed a great strain upon him and interfered with his legal\r\nbusiness to a very serious extent. He was never a wealthy man, and had\r\ntherefore to consider his own future, while a position on the bench was\r\none of honour and dignity which was regarded as worthy of acceptance by\r\nany member of the legal profession.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing worthy of note in the career of Mr. Wilmot as a judge.\r\nHe was never considered to be a deeply read lawyer, but he filled the\r\noffice of judge with dignity and general acceptance. His duties were not\r\nsufficiently arduous to prevent him from having leisure to engage in\r\nother lines of inquiry, for his mind was much interested in questions\r\nconnected with science. He frequently appeared on the lecture platform\r\nand always with success.\r\n\r\nWhen confederation was accomplished, it was felt that of all the natives\r\nof New Brunswick he was the most worthy to be appointed its first\r\nlieutenant-governor under the new régime. Judge Wilmot himself was\r\nwilling to accept the office as a fitting close to his long and active\r\ncareer as a public man; but for some reason, which it is now impossible\r\nto ascertain, the appointment was not made until about a year after\r\nconfederation. Judge Wilmot became lieutenant-governor on July 23rd,\r\n1868, and continued to hold that honourable and important office until\r\nNovember 14th, 1873, when he was succeeded by the Hon. S. L. Tilley.\r\n\r\n{OTHER ACTIVITIES}\r\n\r\nSo far, we have been considering Wilmot as a politician and member of\r\nthe legislature, but a very imperfect idea of his character would be\r\ngathered from regarding him merely in these capacities. He was a\r\nmany-sided man, and had other interests which occupied his attention as\r\nmuch as, or more than, those public questions to which he devoted so\r\nmuch of his vigour. It has already been stated that his father was a\r\nmember of the Baptist Church, and one of the founders of the church of\r\nthat denomination in Fredericton. It does not appear that the son ever\r\nidentified himself with that Church, or that while a youth he gave much\r\nattention to religious matters. It was not until after the death of his\r\nfirst wife, which took place in 1833, that he became affected by\r\nreligious influences and began to attend the services of the Methodist\r\nChurch, the pulpit of which was then filled by the Rev. Enoch Wood, a\r\nman of much ability and eloquence whose style of oratory was very\r\nimpressive. Under his ministrations Mr. Wilmot became a convert, was\r\nbaptized and joined the Methodist Church in Fredericton, and from that\r\ntime until the close of his life he was a very prominent figure in it.\r\nHe filled the office of superintendent of its Sunday School for upwards\r\nof twenty-five years, and was the leader of the church choir for thirty\r\nyears. When he was appointed governor it was thought that he would give\r\nup these offices, but he still continued to fill them, and was\r\nsuperintendent of the Sunday School up to the day when his life came to\r\nan end. He always took a great interest in questions relating to the\r\nBible, and frequently lectured on topics connected with it. He\r\nvehemently opposed the teachings of Darwin and others who followed the\r\nsame line of inquiry, and he stoutly maintained that wherever the Bible\r\nand science were in conflict, science was in the wrong. He seems to have\r\nbeen, from first to last, an unquestioning believer in the doctrines of\r\nthe Christian religion, and he viewed with great disfavour any one who\r\nventured to question any part of its creed. As a lecturer he was\r\neloquent and though discursive, always interesting. None of his lectures\r\nwere written, so that to-day they are only a fading memory to those who\r\nheard them delivered. Though found acceptable at the time, it is hardly\r\nlikely that, if delivered at the present day, they would enjoy so high a\r\ndegree of popularity. People are not now so willing to accept sweeping\r\nassertions which are in conflict with the conclusions of scientific men\r\nwho have devoted their lives to a patient study of the phenomena of life\r\nand the records of creation.\r\n\r\n{INTEREST IN MILITARY MATTERS}\r\n\r\nOne of the most pleasing features of Judge Wilmot's character was his\r\nfondness for children. He was never so happy as when among the young\r\npeople, and long after he became a judge he took an intense interest in\r\ndrilling the schoolboys and instructing them in all martial exercises;\r\nindeed, he seemed to be quite as much devoted to this work as he was to\r\nany other of his numerous employments. When a very young man, he became\r\nan ensign in the first battalion of York County militia, and speedily\r\nrose to be captain. When the so-called Aroostook War[9] broke out in\r\n1839 he was major of a company of rifles attached to that battalion, and\r\nhe volunteered for active service at the front. His interest in military\r\nmatters continued until a late period, and, in the first military camp\r\norganized in the province by the lieutenant-governor, the Hon. Arthur\r\nGordon, in 1863, he commanded one of the battalions. If Wilmot had not\r\nbeen a politician and a lawyer, he might have been a great evangelist or\r\na great soldier.\r\n\r\nJudge Wilmot was very fond of flowers, and the beautiful grounds at\r\nEvelyn Grove, where he resided, were looked upon as the finest in the\r\nprovince. Nearly every visitor to Fredericton found his way to that\r\ncharming place and was sure of a cordial welcome from the judge, who\r\ndelighted to show strangers what he had been able to accomplish in\r\ngrowing flowers and rare plants. Not the least interesting feature of\r\nsuch visits was the conversation of the host, who abounded in knowledge\r\nof horticulture, and was always ready to give others the benefit of his\r\ninformation. It was in this lovely retreat that the last years of Mr.\r\nWilmot's life were passed. When his term as governor expired, the\r\ngovernment of Canada very properly gave him a pension as a retired\r\njudge. In 1875 he succeeded the Right Hon. Mr. Childers, as second\r\ncommissioner under the Prince Edward Island Land Purchase Act. He was\r\nnominated as one of the arbitrators in the Ontario and North-West\r\nBoundary Commission, but did not live long enough to act in that\r\ncapacity.\r\n\r\n{HIS DEATH}\r\n\r\nDuring the last two or three years of his life he suffered much from\r\nchronic neuralgia, which sometimes prevented him from stirring\r\nout-of-doors. No serious result was anticipated, and he was generally\r\nable to take active exercise and engage in his usual routine of duty. On\r\nMonday, May 20th, 1878, while driving in his carriage with his wife, he\r\ncomplained of a sudden and severe pain in the region of the heart. He\r\nwas at once driven home and a physician summoned, but in a few minutes\r\nhe passed away. He had not quite completed his seventieth year. His\r\ndeath evoked expressions of regret and sympathy from every part of the\r\nprovince, and tributes of respect and admiration from many who resided\r\nin other parts of Canada and in the United States.\r\n\r\nJudge Wilmot was twice married. His first wife, whom he married in 1832,\r\nwas Jane, daughter of Mr. James Balloch, of St. John. She died very soon\r\nafter their marriage, and in 1834 he married Miss Elizabeth Black,\r\ndaughter of the Hon. William Black, of Halifax, and granddaughter of the\r\nRev. William Black, who is regarded as the apostle of Wesleyan Methodism\r\nin the Maritime Provinces.\r\n\r\nIn estimating the character and achievements of L. A. Wilmot, regard\r\nmust be had to the conditions under which the battle for responsible\r\ngovernment was fought, and the peculiar difficulties he had to face. He\r\nhad not only to contend against governors determined to use their power\r\nto the utmost, an immovable legislative council and a reactionary\r\nexecutive, but he had to attempt to inspire with something of his own\r\nspirit a House of Assembly which had but little sympathy with his views.\r\nThat he did not accomplish more is less a matter of surprise than that\r\nhe accomplished so much. With heavy odds against him, he contended for\r\nthe rights of the people and the improvement of the constitution, and he\r\nlived to see the principles for which he had fought so firmly\r\nestablished in his native province that they can never be disturbed.\r\n\r\n{A CHAMPION OF THE PEOPLE}\r\n\r\nIt was never his good fortune to be the leader and master of a\r\ngovernment or to have a free hand in the work of legislation. We are\r\ntherefore left in the dark as to what he might have accomplished under\r\nmore favourable conditions. Yet there is but little doubt that, had he\r\nremained in public life, the progress of Reform would have been greatly\r\naccelerated, and that such important measures as the establishing of\r\nfree schools would have been brought about much earlier than was the\r\ncase without his vigorous support. The faults of Wilmot were those that\r\nbelong to an ardent, enthusiastic and liberty-loving temperament. He\r\nhated injustice in every form, and in his denunciation of evil he was\r\nsometimes led to use stronger language than men of cooler feelings\r\napproved. In this way he aroused opposition and left himself open to\r\nattack. Yet it is doubtful whether the censure of his enemies was as\r\ninjurious as the flattery of some who professed to be his friends, and\r\nwho were ready to applaud whatever he said or did. Being accepted as a\r\nleader when a mere youth because he had made a few eloquent speeches, he\r\nmissed the wholesome discipline which most men have to undergo before\r\nthey achieve fame. He would have been a greater and wiser man if he had\r\nbeen spared the unthinking flattery which was too lavishly bestowed upon\r\nhim. Yet, after all has been said by those who would seek to minimize\r\nhis merits, the fact remains that this son of New Brunswick stood for\r\nyears as the foremost champion of the rights of the people, and that it\r\nis impossible to deny him a place among the great men who have assisted\r\nto build up Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[9] The Aroostook War arose out of the unsettled boundary question\r\nbetween Maine and New Brunswick. There was a large area on the St. John\r\nRiver, the ownership of which was in dispute, and in 1839 the difficulty\r\ncame to a head in consequence of the governor of Maine undertaking to\r\nsolve the question in his own way by taking possession of the territory.\r\nGovernor Fairfield, of Maine, sent eighteen hundred militiamen to the\r\nfront and Sir John Harvey, the governor of New Brunswick, issued a\r\nproclamation asserting the right of Great Britain to guard the territory\r\nwhile it was in dispute, and calling on the governor of Maine to\r\nwithdraw his troops. Fairfield denied the right to issue a counter\r\nproclamation and called on the state for ten thousand men. Sir John\r\nHarvey then sent Colonel Maxwell with the 36th and 69th Regiments and a\r\ntrain of artillery to the upper St. John to watch the movements of the\r\nmilitia. A large force of New Brunswick militia was also embodied and\r\nsent to the front. Fortunately, President Van Buren sent General\r\nWinfield Scott to Maine with full power to settle the difficulty. He got\r\ninto a friendly correspondence with Sir John Harvey, which led to an\r\nunderstanding by which the troops on both sides were withdrawn and all\r\ndanger of war averted. The boundary question was afterwards settled by\r\nthe Ashburton Treaty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: S. L. Tilley]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR LEONARD TILLEY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nEARLY LIFE AND BUSINESS CAREER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe political career of Samuel Leonard Tilley did not begin until the\r\nyear that brought the work of Lemuel Allan Wilmot as a legislator to a\r\nclose. Both were elected members of the House of Assembly in 1850, but\r\nin the following year Wilmot was elevated to the bench, so that the\r\nprovince lost his services as a political reformer just as a new man,\r\nwho was destined to win as great a reputation as himself, was stepping\r\non the stage. Samuel Leonard Tilley was born at Gagetown, on the St.\r\nJohn River, on May 8th, 1818, just thirty-five years after the landing\r\nof his royalist grandfather at St. John. He passed away seventy-eight\r\nyears later, full of years and honours, having won the highest prizes\r\nthat it was in the power of his native province to bestow.\r\n\r\n{OF LOYALIST STOCK}\r\n\r\nIn these days, when a man becomes eminent an effort is usually made to\r\ntrace his descent from distinguished ancestors, but most of the early\r\ninhabitants of New Brunswick were too careless in such matters to leave\r\nmuch material to the modern maker of pedigrees. Sir Leonard Tilley was\r\nunable to trace his descent beyond his great-grandfather, Samuel Tilley.\r\nAt one time it was thought that his first ancestor in America was John\r\nTilley, who came over in the _Mayflower_ in 1620, but a closer search of\r\nthe records of the Plymouth colony reveals the fact that John Tilley\r\nleft no sons. But there were persons of the name of Tilley in the\r\nMassachusetts Bay colony as early as 1640, and there seems to be no\r\ndoubt that Sir Leonard Tilley's ancestors had been long in America. They\r\nbelonged to the respectable farming class which has given the Dominion\r\nof Canada and the United States so many of their most distinguished\r\nsons. Samuel Tilley, the great-grandfather of Sir Leonard, was a farmer\r\non Long Island at the time of the American Revolution. His farm was then\r\nwithin the boundaries of the present borough of Brooklyn, and the\r\ncurious in such matters can find the very lot upon which he resided laid\r\ndown upon some of the ancient maps of that locality. At the time the\r\nBritish occupied Long Island, after the battle which took place there in\r\nthe autumn of 1776, resulting in the defeat of the Americans, the\r\nBrooklyn farmers were called upon to provide cattle for the sustenance\r\nof the troops. Samuel Tilley, being a loyal man and a friend of the\r\ngovernment, complied, and for this he was made the subject of attacks by\r\nthe disloyal element among his neighbours, and in the course of time was\r\ncompelled to seek shelter within the British lines. The occupation of\r\nLong Island by the British during the whole period of the war made it\r\nsecure enough for Samuel Tilley, as well as for all loyal men who lived\r\nin the vicinity of Brooklyn; but when the war was over it became\r\nnecessary for him to seek shelter in Nova Scotia, the acts of\r\nconfiscation and banishment against the Loyalists being of the most\r\nsevere character. Samuel Tilley came to New Brunswick with the spring\r\nfleet, which arrived in St. John in May, 1783, and was a grantee of\r\nParrtown, which is now the city of St. John. He erected a house and\r\nstore on King Street, on the south side, just to the east of Germain,\r\nand there commenced a business which he continued for several years. He\r\ndied at St. John in the year 1815. His wife was Elizabeth Morgan, who\r\nsurvived him for many years and died in 1835, aged eighty-four years.\r\n\r\nSir Leonard Tilley was not born when his great-grandfather died, but had\r\na clear recollection of his great-grandmother, who lived for about four\r\nyears after he came to reside in St. John. James Tilley, the grandfather\r\nof Sir Leonard, was also a grantee of Parrtown, he having purchased for\r\na trifling sum, when a boy, a lot on Princess Street, which had been\r\ndrawn by some person who was anxious to dispose of it. James Tilley was\r\na resident of Sunbury County and a magistrate there for a great many\r\nyears, dying in the year 1851. Sir Leonard Tilley's father, Thomas\r\nMorgan Tilley, was born in 1790, and served his time with Israel Gove,\r\nwho was a house-joiner and builder. He spent his early days as a\r\nlumberman, getting out ship timber, his operations being carried on\r\nmainly at Tantiwanty, in the rear of Upper Gagetown. He afterwards went\r\ninto business at Gagetown, and kept a store there down to the time of\r\nhis death, which took place in 1870. Sir Leonard's great-grandmother, on\r\nhis father's side, was Mary Chase, of the Chase family of Massachusetts,\r\nshe having come from Freetown, in that state. Sir Leonard's mother was\r\nSusan Ann Peters, daughter of William Peters, who was for many years a\r\nprominent farmer in Queens County, and a member of the legislative\r\nassembly. William Peters owned a large property and had one of the\r\nfinest tracts of land possessed by any man in the province in his day.\r\nBut he was unwise enough to sell it for the purpose of obtaining money\r\nwith which to enter into lumbering with William Wilmot, the father of L.\r\nA. Wilmot, and, being unsuccessful in his operations, his whole fortune\r\nwas swept away. The ancestors of William Peters were from New York\r\nstate, from which they came with the rest of the Loyalists in 1783.\r\n\r\n{EARLY EDUCATION}\r\n\r\nThe house in Gagetown in which the future governor of New Brunswick and\r\nfinance minister of Canada was born, is still standing and is now used\r\nas a hotel. Gagetown was at that period, and still is, one of the most\r\nbeautiful places in New Brunswick. The river St. John flows in front of\r\nit, and Gagetown Creek, which is almost as wide as the river, laves its\r\nshores. The land in the vicinity is fertile, and fine old trees line the\r\nstreets, giving an air of beauty and refinement to the locality. Sir\r\nLeonard was named after his uncle, Samuel Leonard Peters, and the latter\r\nwas named after an English schoolmaster named Samuel Leonard, who was a\r\ngreat favourite with William Peters, the grandfather of the subject of\r\nthis biography. Samuel Leonard, after leaving Gagetown, appears to have\r\nremoved to Nova Scotia, and probably died in that province. When Sir\r\nLeonard was five years old he was sent to the Madras School in Gagetown,\r\nof which Samuel Babbitt was the teacher. He attended this school from\r\n1823 until 1827, when the grammar school was instituted in Gagetown. The\r\nMadras school system was at that time in high favour with the people of\r\nthe province, and these schools received large grants from the\r\ngovernment, it being thought that this system was more advantageous than\r\nany other for the instruction of youth. This idea, however, did not\r\nprove to be universally correct, for in the course of a few years we\r\nfind the legislature declaring that while they believed the Madras\r\nsystem suitable to towns and populous places, it did not answer so well\r\nin rural districts. Samuel Babbitt, the teacher of the Madras School,\r\nwas clerk of the parish, and, according to the custom of that day, led\r\nthe responses in church. The rector of Gagetown at this period was the\r\nRev. Samuel Clark. The teacher of the local grammar school which young\r\nTilley attended from 1827 to 1831 was William Jenkins, a graduate of\r\nDublin University. Jenkins was a very severe man, and believed in the\r\ndoctrine that he who spares the rod spoils the child, and Sir Leonard\r\nhad a very vivid recollection of the vigour with which he applied the\r\nbirch. He removed from Gagetown shortly after 1831, and took up his\r\nresidence in Quebec, where he conducted a large school for many years,\r\ndying about the year 1863. Sir Leonard, after he had become a well-known\r\npolitical character and a member of the government of New Brunswick, had\r\nthe pleasure of paying him a visit some time in 1858.\r\n\r\nAn interesting incident occurred in 1827, at the time young Tilley\r\ncommenced to attend the grammar school. Sir Howard Douglas, who was then\r\ngovernor of New Brunswick, paid a visit to Gagetown and was the guest of\r\nColonel Harry Peters, the speaker of the House of Assembly. While the\r\ngovernor and his host were walking through Gagetown, they met young\r\nTilley and a son of Harry Peters returning from school, and the boys\r\nwere introduced to His Excellency, who presented each of them with a\r\nSpanish quarter-dollar. Sir Leonard could remember and often spoke of\r\nthe appearance of Sir Howard Douglas, dressed in a blue coat with brass\r\nbuttons, a fine-looking gentleman, with a pleasant face and a kindly\r\nsmile. Little thought the then governor of New Brunswick that the boy to\r\nwhom he was speaking, a lad of nine years of age, would fifty years\r\nlater sit in his own chair in the government house.\r\n\r\n{ENTERS ON BUSINESS LIFE}\r\n\r\nYoung Tilley was not the kind of youth likely to be satisfied to reside\r\nall his life in Gagetown. Other boys of less ambition might be content\r\nto settle down on the farm and to fulfil their destinies within the\r\ncomparatively limited sphere of action which that little town in Queens\r\nCounty afforded, but he had within him longings for a higher destiny\r\nthan he was likely to attain as a resident of a rural district.\r\n\r\nYoung Tilley came to St. John in May, 1831, at the age of thirteen. He\r\nat once entered the drugstore of Dr. Henry Cook, as a clerk, it being\r\nthe fashion of those times for medical men to have a dispensary in\r\nconnection with their professional practice, so that they could give\r\nadvice, and dispense their own prescriptions with equal facility. He\r\ncontinued as clerk with Dr. Cook until February, 1835, when he entered\r\nthe service of William O. Smith, who, in later years, was mayor of St.\r\nJohn. It was while a clerk with Smith that Tilley became a member of the\r\nSt. John Young Men's Debating Society, an organization which, if it has\r\nno other claim to the remembrance of posterity, at least has that of\r\ngiving one distinguished statesman to British America, and a governor to\r\nNew Brunswick. It was in this society that he made his first attempt at\r\npublic speaking, and it may be said that from the very beginning he\r\nshowed a remarkable aptitude for debate and public discussions.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1837, he took one of the most important steps of his life\r\nin espousing the cause of total abstinence. Having taken up this\r\nmovement, he threw his whole energy into it, and from that time down to\r\nthe day of his death he was a consistent temperance man, and a strong\r\nadvocate of the principle of total abstinence. It was, perhaps, this\r\nstrong advocacy of the cause of temperance, more than anything else,\r\nthat brought him before the public as a suitable person to become a\r\ncandidate for the House of Assembly, and led to his first election as a\r\nrepresentative for the city of St. John in the local legislature\r\nthirteen years later. Certainly the fact that Tilley, from that time\r\nuntil the close of his public career, had always the support of the\r\ntemperance societies, gave him a strength which he hardly would have\r\nobtained otherwise, and rallied around him a phalanx of friends, who,\r\nfor fidelity to his interests and zeal for his political advancement,\r\ncould hardly have been surpassed.\r\n\r\nTilley commenced business on his own account in 1838, before he had\r\nattained the age of twenty years, as a member of the firm of Peters &\r\nTilley, and he continued a successful career until 1855, when he\r\ntransferred his business to Mr. T. B. Barker, the founder of the present\r\nfirm of T. B. Barker & Sons. It is unnecessary to say anything more in\r\nregard to Mr. Tilley's life as a business man than that it was a highly\r\nprosperous one. He showed so much energy and enterprise that when he\r\nentered political life he was comparatively wealthy. There is no doubt\r\nthat if he had continued in business instead of devoting his energies to\r\nthe service of the province and Dominion, he would have made far more\r\nmoney than he obtained as a politician.\r\n\r\n{COLONIAL TRADE}\r\n\r\nThe movement in behalf of free trade, which was changing the fiscal\r\npolicy of the United Kingdom in the closing years of the first half of\r\nthe nineteenth century, did not meet with much favour in New Brunswick,\r\nbecause it seriously affected the leading industry of the province.\r\nColonial timber had long enjoyed a preference in the British market, but\r\nthis preference had been seriously impaired by imperial legislation and\r\nwas likely to be taken away altogether if free trade principles should\r\nprevail. Many remonstrances had been sent to the British government\r\nagainst the reduction or abolition of the duty on foreign timber which\r\ncame into competition with the colonial product, but these remonstrances\r\nproved wholly unavailing, and it was seriously believed that the\r\ncolonial timber trade would be destroyed. This led to the annexation\r\nmovement of 1848, which affected all the provinces, while it also caused\r\nthe formation of organizations pledged to resist the free trade\r\nmovement. Tilley was in sympathy with these efforts to preserve colonial\r\ntrade, and it was in consequence of this that he first made his\r\nentrance into political life.\r\n\r\n{GENERAL ELECTION OF 1850}\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the electors of St. John in favour of protection, which\r\nwas held previous to the general election of 1850, Tilley was nominated\r\nas one of the candidates for the city of St. John. He was not present at\r\nthe meeting and had no knowledge whatever of the intention of the\r\nelectors to make such a nomination. A meeting was called a few nights\r\nlater in Carleton to confirm the nomination, and at that meeting Tilley\r\nwas present. He then made the strongest possible protest against the\r\nnomination, but the electors present would not take \"No\" for an answer,\r\nand he eventually consented to stand as a candidate, informing them at\r\nthe same time that he had an engagement to be in Boston on the day fixed\r\nfor the nomination, and could not be at the hustings on that day.\r\nNotwithstanding this statement they still persisted in his nomination,\r\nbut as Tilley was absent in the United States, his nomination speech on\r\nthat occasion was made by Joseph W. Lawrence, who afterwards was found\r\namong his strongest political opponents. At the general election of 1850\r\nall the candidates elected for the city and county of St. John were\r\navowed opponents of the government. Tilley was returned at the head of\r\nthe poll, while W. H. Needham, who ran with him, was likewise elected.\r\nThe members elected for the county were R. D. Wilmot, William J.\r\nRitchie, John H. Gray and Charles Simonds; while J. R. Partelow,\r\nCharles Watters and John Jordan were the three defeated candidates. The\r\nlist of candidates for the city and county of St. John included two\r\nfuture governors, a future chief-justice of the supreme court of Canada\r\nand two other judges, to say nothing of the provincial secretary, Mr.\r\nPartelow, a speaker of the House of Assembly and a future mayor of St.\r\nJohn. It must be admitted that few elections that have ever been held in\r\nany part of British North America have had so many candidates presented\r\nto the electors who were afterwards eminent in public life. This\r\nelection took place at an important epoch in the history of the\r\nprovince, when the old order was passing away and men's minds were\r\nprepared for a great change in political affairs. It was a Reform House\r\nof Assembly, and, although all the members elected for the purpose of\r\nupholding Reform principles did not prove true to their trust, still it\r\ncontained a larger number of men of Liberal views than any of its\r\npredecessors.\r\n\r\nAmong the members of this House were several who had taken a very\r\nimportant part in public affairs, or who afterwards became members of\r\nthe executive. The county of York sent among its representatives, Lemuel\r\nA. Wilmot, who had been a member of the House for sixteen years, and who\r\nhad taken a leading part in many measures of importance for the\r\nimprovement of the system by which the country was governed.\r\n\r\nMr. Charles Fisher, who had been a colleague of Mr. Wilmot in the county\r\nof York, was defeated at the general election, but soon afterwards\r\nbecame a member of the House. Mr. Fisher had not the oratorical gifts\r\npossessed by Mr. Wilmot, but he was even stronger in his Liberal views,\r\nand as a constitutional lawyer he had no equal, at that time, in the\r\nprovince. Although his manners were somewhat uncouth and his address far\r\nfrom polished, Fisher had strong individuality and a singularly clear\r\nintellect. His services in the cause of Liberalism in New Brunswick can\r\nhardly be overestimated, and these services were rendered at a time when\r\nto be a Liberal was to be, to a large extent, ostracized by the great\r\nand powerful who looked upon any interference with their vested rights\r\nas little short of treason.\r\n\r\nTilley's colleague from St. John city was William H. Needham, who\r\nafterwards represented the county of York in the legislature. Mr.\r\nNeedham had some remarkable gifts as a speaker and a public man, and he\r\nmight have risen to a much higher position than he ever attained had it\r\nnot been that his principles were somewhat uncertain. In truth, Needham\r\nnever succeeded in getting sufficiently clear of the world to be quite\r\nindependent, and this misfortune hampered him greatly in his political\r\ncareer.\r\n\r\n{NOTABLE CANDIDATES}\r\n\r\nOne of the members from St. John County was William J. Ritchie, a lawyer\r\nwho had risen by his own efforts to a commanding position at the bar,\r\nand who became chief-justice of Canada. Mr. Ritchie had been a member of\r\nthe House of Assembly for several years, and always a useful one. He\r\npossessed what few members at that time had,--a clear knowledge of the\r\ntrue principles of responsible government. He had an eminently practical\r\nmind; he was a forcible and impressive speaker, and he was bold in the\r\nenunciation of the Liberal principles to which he held. It was a serious\r\nmisfortune to the province that at a comparatively early age he was\r\ntransferred to the bench, so that his great abilities were lost at a\r\ncritical period when they might have been useful to New Brunswick in\r\nmany ways.\r\n\r\nJohn H. Gray, a new member, also sat in this House for the county of St.\r\nJohn. Mr. Gray was a man of fine presence, handsome appearance, and had\r\na style of oratory that was very captivating and impressive. His\r\nfluency, however, was greater than his ability, and he injured himself\r\nby deserting the Liberal party, which he had been elected to uphold.\r\nGray never quite recovered from the unpopularity connected with this\r\naction, and he never became in any sense a real leader. The party he had\r\ndeserted soon obtained the control of the province, and his final\r\nappearance in the legislature was as a supporter of Mr. Tilley, content\r\nto play a secondary part during the great confederation conflict.\r\n\r\nRobert Duncan Wilmot, another of the St. John County members, a first\r\ncousin of L. A. Wilmot, was not new to the legislature, and his mind\r\nbeing naturally conservative, it is in connection with the Conservative\r\nparty that he is best known in the history of the province. He was\r\nelected as a Liberal, however, in 1850, but seems to have forgotten that\r\nfact as soon as he reached the House of Assembly. This was not the only\r\noccasion on which Wilmot contrived to change his principles, for he\r\nperformed a similar feat during the confederation contest, and left the\r\nanti-confederate government of 1865 in the lurch at a moment when its\r\nexistence almost depended on his fidelity. Wilmot never was an eloquent\r\nman, and he entertained some highly visionary views in regard to an\r\nirredeemable paper currency, but he was a useful public servant, and he\r\nafterwards became a member of the government of Canada and eventually\r\nlieutenant-governor of New Brunswick.\r\n\r\n{JOHN R. PARTELOW}\r\n\r\nThe Hon. John R. Partelow, who was defeated in St. John but elected for\r\nVictoria, was a man who might have acquired a great political reputation\r\nhad the stage on which he appeared been a larger one. Partelow's\r\nqualifications for high public position did not depend upon his oratory,\r\nwhich was not of a high order, but upon his moderation and good sense.\r\nPartelow's origin was humble, and his early days were spent as a clerk\r\nin a store on the North Wharf, St. John. In that subordinate position he\r\nmade himself so useful and displayed so much ability that he was marked\r\nfor promotion. The idea of bringing him forward as a candidate for the\r\ncity of St. John seems to have originated with his employers, but when\r\nhe gained a seat in the legislature he speedily made his influence felt.\r\nPartelow spoke but seldom, but when he did address the legislature it\r\nwas generally with good effect, and after the subject had been to a\r\nlarge extent exhausted by previous speakers. He then had a faculty of\r\ndrafting a resolution which seemed to express the general sense of all,\r\nand which was usually accepted as a solution of the matter. He was a\r\ngood business man, understood accounts thoroughly and, therefore, had a\r\ngreat advantage in legislative work over those who were not so well\r\nequipped in this respect. New Brunswick may have produced greater men\r\nthan he in public life, but none whose talents were more useful to the\r\nprovince, or better fitted to serve its interests at a critical period\r\nin its constitutional history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nELECTED TO THE LEGISLATURE\r\n\r\n\r\nShortly after the general election, Chief-Justice Chipman, who had been\r\nin infirm health, resigned his office, and a vacancy was thus left on\r\nthe bench of the supreme court of the province. In the natural course,\r\nthis office ought to have gone to the attorney-general, Mr. L. A.\r\nWilmot, but this appointment was not made. The council were unable to\r\nunite in any recommendation to the governor, who consequently laid all\r\nthe facts before the home government and in reply received instructions\r\nto give the chief-justiceship to Judge Carter and to offer the puisne\r\njudgeship to Mr. Wilmot, or, if he should refuse it, to Mr. Kinnear, the\r\nsolicitor-general. The executive council complained that the appointment\r\nof Mr. Wilmot to a seat on the bench by the authority of the secretary\r\nof state without the advice or recommendation of the responsible\r\nexecutive within the province, was at variance with the principles of\r\nresponsible government which were understood to be in force. They,\r\nhowever, had only themselves to thank for this, for they were\r\ncontinually appealing to Downing Street. As a majority of the House had\r\nbeen elected as opponents of the government, it was supposed there\r\nwould be no difficulty in bringing about a change of administration. Mr.\r\nSimonds, of St. John, who was reputed to be a Liberal, was elected\r\nspeaker without opposition, and at an early day in the session Mr.\r\nRitchie, of St. John, moved, as an amendment to the address, a\r\nwant-of-confidence resolution. This resolution, instead of being carried\r\nby a large majority as was expected, was lost by a vote of fifteen to\r\ntwenty-two, Messrs. Alexander Rankine and John T. Williston, of\r\nNorthumberland, Messrs. Robert Gordon and Joseph Reed, of Gloucester,\r\nMr. A. Barbarie, of Restigouche, and Mr. Francis McPhelim, of Kent,\r\nhaving deserted their Liberal allies. Had they proved faithful, the\r\ngovernment would have been defeated, and the province would have been\r\nspared another three years of an incompetent administration.\r\n\r\nIn this division, Tilley and Needham, who represented the city of St.\r\nJohn, and Messrs. R. D. Wilmot and Gray, two of the county members,\r\nvoted for Ritchie's amendment. As Wilmot and Gray showed by their votes\r\nthat they had no confidence in the government in February, 1851, it was\r\nwith much surprise that the people of St. John, in the August following,\r\nlearned that they had become members of the administration which they\r\nhad so warmly condemned a few months before. Their secession from the\r\nLiberal party destroyed whatever chance had before existed of ousting\r\nthe government. Mr. Fisher had seceded from the government in\r\nconsequence of their action in reference to the judicial appointments,\r\nand John Ambrose Street, who was a member for Northumberland, became\r\nattorney-general in place of Robert Parker, appointed a judge. Mr.\r\nStreet was a ready debater and a strong Conservative, and his entrance\r\ninto the government at that time showed that a Conservative policy was\r\nto be maintained.\r\n\r\n{RAILWAY LEGISLATION}\r\n\r\nMr. Street, as leader of the government in the assembly, presented a\r\nlong programme of measures for the consideration of the legislature,\r\nnone of which proved to be of any particular value. The municipal\r\ncorporation bill was passed, but it was a permissive measure, and was\r\nnot taken advantage of by any of the counties. A bill to make the\r\nlegislative council elective, which was also passed in the Lower House\r\nat the instance of the government, was defeated in the Upper Chamber.\r\nThe bill appointing commissioners on law reform was carried, and\r\nresulted in the production of the three volumes of the revised statutes\r\nissued in 1854. The most important bill of the session, introduced by\r\nthe government, was one in aid of the construction of a railroad from\r\nSt. John to Shediac. This bill provided that the government should give\r\na company two hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling, to assist in\r\nthe construction of the line referred to. There was also a bill to\r\nassist the St. Andrews and Quebec Railroad to the extent of fifty\r\nthousand pounds, and a bonus or subvention to the Shediac line\r\namounting to upwards of eleven thousand dollars a mile, for which sum a\r\nvery good railway could be constructed at the present time. It may be\r\nstated here that, although the company was formed and undertook to build\r\na railway to Shediac under the terms offered by the government, the\r\nprovince had eventually to build the road at a cost of forty thousand\r\ndollars a mile, or fully double what a similar road could be constructed\r\nfor now.\r\n\r\n{KING'S COLLEGE}\r\n\r\nOne of the measures brought forward by the government at this session\r\nwas with reference to the schools of the province. The idea of taxing\r\nthe property of the county for the support of public schools had not\r\nthen found any general acceptance in New Brunswick; indeed, it was not\r\ntill the year 1872 that the measure embodying this principle was passed\r\nby the legislature. The government school bill of 1851 provided that the\r\nteachers were to be paid in money, or board and lodging, by the district\r\nto the amount of ten pounds for six months, in addition to the\r\ngovernment allowance. This bill was a very slight improvement on the Act\r\nthen in force, and as the government left it to the House to deal with,\r\nand did not press it as a government measure, it was not passed. A\r\nprivate member, Mr. Gilbert, of Queens, at this session proposed to\r\nconvert King's College into an agricultural school, with a model farm\r\nattached. King's College had been established by an Act passed in 1829,\r\nand had received a large endowment from the province, but it never was a\r\npopular institution because of its connection with a single Church. The\r\noriginal charter of the college made the bishop of the diocese the\r\nvisitor, and required the president to be always a clergyman of the\r\nChurch of England; and, although this had been changed in 1845 by the\r\nlegislature, the number of students who attended it was always small,\r\nand it was shown in the course of debate that it had failed to fulfil\r\nthe object for which it was created. The college council consisted of\r\nfifteen members, of whom ten were Episcopalians; and the visitor, the\r\nchancellor, the president, the principal, five out of seven of the\r\nprofessors and teachers, and the two examiners were members of the same\r\nChurch. The services in the college chapel were required to be attended\r\nby all resident students, and of the eighteen students then in the\r\ncollege, sixteen were Episcopalians. It was felt that this college\r\nrequired to be placed on a different footing, and Mr. Gilbert's bill,\r\nalthough it provoked much hostile comment at the time, certainly would\r\nhave been more beneficial to the educational interests of the country,\r\nif it had passed, than the state of affairs which resulted from the\r\ncontinuance of the old system. An agricultural school was the very thing\r\nthe province required, while, judging from the limited attendance at the\r\ncollege at that time, the people of this province were not greatly\r\nimpressed with the value of a classical education. In 1851, however,\r\nany one who proposed to replace a college for the teaching of Greek and\r\nLatin with a college of agriculture, and the sciences allied to it, was\r\nlooked upon as a Philistine. Then youths were taught to compose Latin\r\nand to read Greek who never, to the day of their death, had a competent\r\nknowledge of their own language; and agricultural studies, which were of\r\nthe highest importance to more than one-half of the people of the\r\nprovince, were totally neglected. Mr. Gilbert's bill was defeated, as it\r\nwas certain to be in a legislature which was still under the domination\r\nof old ideas. Had it passed, New Brunswick might at this time have had a\r\nlarge body of scientific farmers capable of cultivating the soil in the\r\nmost efficient manner, and increasing its productiveness to an extent\r\nhardly dreamed of by those who only consider it in the light of the\r\npresent system of cultivation.\r\n\r\nDuring this session, Mr. Ritchie of St. John moved a series of\r\nresolutions condemning the government, and complaining of the colonial\r\noffice and of the conduct of the governor. These resolutions declared:\r\nfirst, that the House was entitled to full copies of all despatches\r\naddressed to or received from the colonial office, and that it was not\r\nenough merely to send extracts from a despatch which had been received\r\nby the governor. They declared that the power of making appointments to\r\noffices was vested in the governor by and with the advice of the\r\nexecutive council, and that the appointment of the chief-justice and a\r\npuisne judge by the governor, contrary to the advice of his council, was\r\ninconsistent with the principles of responsible government. They\r\ncomplained that the salaries were excessive, and condemned the refusal\r\nof the British government to allow the colonies to grant bounties for\r\nthe development of their resources. These resolutions, after being\r\ndebated for about a week, were rejected by a vote of twenty-one to\r\nnineteen, the smallness of the majority against them at the time being\r\nlooked upon as virtually a Liberal victory. If the nineteen had been\r\nmade up of men who could be relied on to stand by their colours in all\r\nemergencies, it would have been a Liberal triumph, but, unfortunately,\r\namong the nineteen there were some who afterwards deserted their party\r\nfor the sake of offices and power.\r\n\r\n{A POLITICAL SURPRISE}\r\n\r\nEarly in August it was announced that John H. Gray and R. D. Wilmot, two\r\nof the Liberal members for the county of St. John, had abandoned their\r\nparty and their principles and become members of the government. The\r\nLiberals of St. John, who had elected these gentlemen by a substantial\r\nmajority, were naturally chagrined at such a proof of their\r\nfaithlessness, and their colleagues were likewise greatly annoyed.\r\nMessrs. Gray and Wilmot made the usual excuses of all deserters for\r\ntheir conduct, the principal one being that they thought they could\r\nserve the interests of the constituency and of the province better by\r\nbeing in the government than out of it. The friends of the four members\r\nwho still remained faithful, Messrs. Tilley, Simonds, Ritchie and\r\nNeedham, held a meeting at which these gentlemen were present, and it\r\nwas agreed that they should join in an address to their constituents\r\ncondemning the course of Messrs. Wilmot and Gray, and calling on the\r\nconstituency to pronounce judgment upon it. As Wilmot, who had been\r\nappointed to the office of surveyor-general, had to return to his\r\nconstituency for reëlection, the voice of the constituency could only be\r\nascertained by placing a candidate in the field in opposition to him.\r\nThis was done, and Mr. Allan McLean was elected to oppose Mr. Wilmot.\r\nThe result seemed to show that the people of St. John had condoned the\r\noffence, for Wilmot was reëlected by a majority of two hundred and\r\nseventy-three. As this appeared to be a proof that they had lost the\r\nconfidence of their constituents, Messrs. Simonds, Ritchie and Tilley at\r\nonce resigned their seats and did not offer for reëlection. This act\r\nwas, at the time, thought by many to indicate an excess of\r\nsensitiveness, and Needham refused to follow their example, thereby\r\nforfeiting the regard of most of those who had formerly supported him.\r\nThe sequel proved that the three resigning members were right, for they\r\nwon much more in public respect by their conduct than they lost by their\r\ntemporary exclusion from the House of Assembly.\r\n\r\n{THE ST. JOHN ELECTION}\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen returned for the three seats in St. John which had been\r\nvacated by the resigning members were James A. Harding, John Goddard and\r\nJohn Johnson. Mr. Harding, who ran for the city, was opposed by S. K.\r\nFoster. Harding was a Liberal, but this fact does not seem to have been\r\nkept in view when he was elected. The net result of the whole affair was\r\nthat the constituency of St. John could not be relied upon to support a\r\nLiberal principle, or any kind of principle as against men. That has\r\nalways been a peculiarity of the St. John constituencies, men being more\r\nimportant than measures, and frequently a mere transient feeling being\r\nset off against the most important considerations of general policy.\r\n\r\nTilley was not in the House of Assembly during the sessions of 1852,\r\n1853 and 1854; that period was one, however, of development in political\r\nmatters and of substantial progress. The governor's speech at the\r\nopening of the session of 1852 was largely devoted to railways, and it\r\nexpressed the opinion that a railroad connecting Canada and Nova Scotia,\r\nand a connection with a line from St. John to the United States, would\r\nproduce an abundant return to the province, and that by this means\r\nmillions of tons of timber, then standing worthless in the forest, would\r\nfind a profitable market. It was during this session that Messrs. Peto,\r\nBrassy and Betts proposed to construct the European and North American\r\nRailway, on certain conditions. The subsidies offered by the province at\r\nthis time were twenty thousand pounds a year for twenty years, and a\r\nmillion acres of land for the European and North American Railway, as\r\nthe line to the United States was termed; and for the Quebec line,\r\ntwenty-two thousand pounds sterling for twenty years, and two million\r\nacres of land. A new company, which included Mr. Jackson, M. P., offered\r\nto build the New Brunswick section of both railroads, upon the province\r\ngranting them a subsidy of twenty thousand pounds a year for twenty\r\nyears, and four million acres of land. Attorney-General Street\r\nintroduced a series of railway resolutions favouring the building of the\r\nIntercolonial Railway jointly by the three provinces, according to terms\r\nwhich had been agreed upon by the delegates of each. The arrangement was\r\nthat the Intercolonial Railway should be built through the valley of the\r\nSt. John, and for favouring resolutions in the House confirming this\r\narrangement, Mr. Street's Northumberland constituents called upon him to\r\nresign his seat, a step which he refused to take.\r\n\r\n{INTERCOLONIAL RAILWAY}\r\n\r\nThe government railway resolutions were carried by a large majority.\r\nDuring the recess Mr. Chandler, as a representative of New Brunswick,\r\nand Mr. Hincks, a representative of Canada, went to London to endeavour\r\nto obtain from the British government a sum sufficient to build the\r\nIntercolonial Railway. The request of the delegates was refused on the\r\nground that such a work had to be one of military necessity, and that\r\nthe route which had been selected, by the valley of the St. John, was\r\nnot a proper one for military purposes. As Mr. Chandler could not obtain\r\nwhat he wished from the British government, he applied to Messrs. Peto,\r\nBrassy and Betts, who said they were prepared to build all the railroads\r\nthat New Brunswick might require, upon the most advantageous terms. Mr.\r\nJackson visited the province in September of the same year, and it was\r\nagreed that his company should build a railway from St. John to Amherst,\r\nand from St. John to the United States frontier, the distance being then\r\nestimated at two hundred and fourteen miles, for the sum of sixty-five\r\nhundred pounds sterling per mile. The province was to take stock to the\r\nextent of twelve hundred pounds per mile, and to lend its bonds to the\r\ncompany for one thousand eight hundred pounds additional per mile. The\r\ncompletion of this arrangement caused great rejoicing in the province,\r\nespecially in St. John, a special session of the legislature being\r\ncalled on October 21st for the express purpose of amending the Railway\r\nAct so that it might conform to the new conditions. As both branches of\r\nthe legislature were strongly in favour of the railway policy of the\r\ngovernment, the necessary bills were speedily passed and the legislature\r\nwas prorogued after a session of eight days.\r\n\r\nThe meeting of the legislature in 1853 derived its principal importance\r\nfrom the fact that much of its time was taken up with the discussion of\r\nthe question of a reciprocity treaty with the United States of America.\r\nThe discussion disclosed a strong disinclination on the part of many\r\nmembers to any arrangement by which the fisheries would be surrendered.\r\nAn address to the queen was agreed to by both branches of the\r\nlegislature in which it was stated that the exclusive use of the\r\nfisheries by the inhabitants of British North America would be much more\r\nadvantageous and satisfactory than anything which the United States\r\ncould offer as an equivalent. It was also stated that no reciprocity\r\ntreaty with that country would be satisfactory to New Brunswick which\r\ndid not embrace the free exchange of raw materials and natural products\r\nand the admission of colonial built vessels to registry in American\r\nports. The tone of the discussions on this subject, both in 1853 and\r\n1854, shows that reciprocity with the United States was not generally\r\nregarded as being an equivalent for the giving of the fisheries to our\r\nneighbours, and it is quite clear that, so far as New Brunswick was\r\nconcerned, the reciprocity treaty would not have been agreed to had it\r\nnot been that the matter was in the hands of the British government, and\r\nthat the legislature of the province was not disposed to resist\r\nstrenuously any arrangement which that government thought it wise to\r\nmake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE PROHIBITORY LIQUOR LAW\r\n\r\n\r\nThe House which had been elected in 1850 was dissolved after the\r\nprorogation in 1854, and the election came on in the month of July. It\r\nwas a memorable occasion, because it was certain that the topics\r\ndiscussed by the House then to be elected would be of the very highest\r\nimportance. One of these subjects was the reciprocity treaty, which at\r\nthat time had been arranged with the United States through the British\r\ngovernment. This treaty provided for the free interchange of certain\r\nnatural products between the great republic and the several provinces\r\nwhich later formed the Dominion of Canada, and it had been brought about\r\nthrough the efforts of Lord Elgin, who at that time was governor-general\r\nof Canada. The treaty was agreed to on June 5th, and was subject to\r\nratification by the imperial parliament and the legislatures of the\r\nBritish North American colonies which were affected by it. In the St.\r\nJohn constituencies there was at that time a strong feeling in favour of\r\na protection policy, but this did not interfere with the desire to\r\neffect the interchange of raw material with the United States on\r\nadvantageous terms. Tilley had been originally nominated as a\r\nprotectionist, and still held views favourable to the encouragement and\r\nprotection of native industries by means of the tariff, but he was also\r\nfavourable to reciprocity with the United States if it could be obtained\r\nin such a manner as to be beneficial to the province. At the general\r\nelection he led the poll in the city of St. John, his colleague being\r\nJames A. Harding, who had been elected at a bye-election to the previous\r\nHouse. For the county, Mr. William J. Ritchie was one of the successful\r\ncandidates, and the only Liberal returned for that constituency. The\r\nother members for the county were the Hon. John R. Partelow, Robert D.\r\nWilmot and John H. Gray.\r\n\r\nThe new House was called together on October 19th for the purpose of\r\nratifying the reciprocity treaty, and the Hon. D. L. Hanington was\r\nelected speaker by a vote of twenty-three to thirteen. This gave the\r\nopposition an earlier opportunity of defeating the Street-Partelow\r\nadministration than would, under ordinary circumstances, have been\r\npossible. An amendment to the address was moved by the Hon. Charles\r\nFisher, which was an indictment of the government for their various\r\nshortcomings and offences. The amendment was to expunge the whole of the\r\nfifth paragraph and substitute for it the following:--\r\n\r\n\"It is with feelings of loyalty and attachment to Her Majesty's person\r\nand government that we recognize, in that provision of the treaty which\r\nrequires the concurrence of this legislature, a distinct avowal by the\r\nimperial government of their determination to preserve inviolate the\r\nprinciples of self-government, and to regard the constitution of the\r\nprovince as sacred as that of the parent state. We regret that the\r\nconduct of the administration during the last few years has not been in\r\naccordance with these principles, and we feel constrained thus early to\r\nstate to your Excellency that your constitutional advisers have not\r\nconducted the government of the province in the true spirit of our\r\ncolonial constitution.\" This amendment was debated for six days, and was\r\ncarried by a vote of twenty-seven to twelve.\r\n\r\n{QUESTION OF THE JUDGES REVIVED}\r\n\r\nThe general ground of accusation against the government, and the one\r\nmost strongly insisted upon, was that it had yielded to the influence of\r\nthe colonial office in the appointment of Judge Wilmot. It was well\r\nknown that the government at that time, or at least a majority of them,\r\ndid not consider it necessary to appoint another judge; at all events,\r\nthey took no steps to bring about another appointment; but they yielded\r\nto the colonial office, and the pressure put upon them by Sir Edmund\r\nHead, the lieutenant-governor, so far as to acquiesce in the appointment\r\nof Judge Carter as chief-justice, and the elevation of Mr. Wilmot to the\r\nbench. This was a fair ground of attack, because it was clear that if\r\nthe executive council of New Brunswick was under the orders of the home\r\ngovernment, representative institutions and responsible government did\r\nnot exist.\r\n\r\nThus the Street-Partelow government fell, and with it disappeared, at\r\nonce and forever, the old Conservative régime which had existed in the\r\nprovince from its foundation, and which, unavoidably no doubt, had\r\npresided over the early political life of the colony, but the undue\r\ncontinuance of which was wholly incompatible with the full development\r\nof representative institutions and responsible government. It was a\r\ngreat triumph for the cause of Liberalism that the Conservatives of that\r\nperiod were not only defeated, but swept altogether out of existence.\r\nAfter that a government of men who called themselves Conservatives might\r\ngo into power, but the old state of affairs, under which the\r\nlieutenant-governor could exercise almost despotic powers, had departed\r\nforever, and could no more be revived than the heptarchy. All that a\r\nConservative government could do after that was to fall into line with\r\nthe policy of the men they had displaced, and proceed, less rapidly\r\nperhaps, but none the less surely, along the path of political progress.\r\n\r\nThe new government which was formed as the result of this vote had for\r\nits premier the Hon. Charles Fisher, who took the office of\r\nattorney-general; Mr. Tilley became provincial secretary; Mr. James\r\nBrown, a few weeks later, received the office of surveyor-general; J. M.\r\nJohnson, one of the members for Northumberland, became solicitor-general;\r\nand William J. Ritchie, Albert J. Smith and William H. Steeves were\r\nmembers of the government without office.\r\n\r\nThe bill to give effect to the reciprocity treaty passed its third\r\nreading on November 2d, only five members voting against it. On motion\r\nof the Hon. Mr. Ritchie, one of the members of the new government, it\r\nwas resolved that it was desirable and expedient that the\r\nsurveyor-general, who was a political officer, should hold a seat in the\r\nHouse of Assembly, and that the government should carry out the wishes\r\nof the House in this respect. Before the House again met the wishes of\r\nthe House had been complied with, and Mr. Brown, of Charlotte, became\r\nsurveyor-general.\r\n\r\n{SESSION OF 1855}\r\n\r\nThe House met again on February 1st, 1855, and then the real work of\r\nlegislative and administrative reform began. In the speech from the\r\nthrone it was stated that the Customs Act would expire in the course of\r\na year, and that it was necessary that a new Act should be passed. A\r\nbetter system of auditing the public accounts was also recommended, and\r\na better system of electing members to the legislature. On March 5th,\r\ncorrespondence was brought down, dated the previous 15th of August,\r\nannouncing, on the part of the imperial government, the withdrawal of\r\nthe imperial customs establishment, which was considered to be no longer\r\nnecessary, and stating that as the duties of these offices were now\r\nmainly in connection with the registration of vessels in the colonies,\r\nand the granting of certificates of the origin of colonial products,\r\nthis work would hereafter be performed by the colonial officers. A\r\nletter addressed to the comptrollers and other customs officers had\r\ninformed them that their services would be discontinued after January\r\n5th, 1855. So disappeared the last remnant of the old imperial\r\ncustom-house system, which had been the cause of so many difficulties in\r\nall the colonies and which had done more than anything else to bring\r\nabout the revolution which separated the thirteen colonies from the\r\nmother country.\r\n\r\nThe great measure of the session of 1855 was the law to prevent the\r\nimportation, manufacture or selling of liquor. This bill was brought in\r\nby Mr. Tilley as a private member, and not on behalf of the government.\r\nIt was introduced on March 3d. Considering its importance and the fact\r\nthat it led to a crisis in the affairs of the government and the\r\ntemporary defeat of the Liberal party, it went through the House with\r\ncomparatively little difficulty. It was first considered on March 19th,\r\nand a motion to postpone its further consideration for three months was\r\nlost by a vote of seventeen to twenty-one. The final division on the\r\nthird reading was taken on March 27th, and the vote was twenty-one to\r\neighteen, so that every member of the House, with one exception, voted\r\nyea or nay. The closeness of this last division should have warned the\r\nadvocate of the measure that it was likely to produce difficulty, for it\r\nis clear that all laws which are intended to regulate the personal\r\nhabits of men must be ineffectual unless they have the support of a\r\nlarge majority of the people affected by them. That this was not the\r\ncase with the prohibitory liquor law was shown by the vote in the\r\nlegislature, and it was still more clearly shown after the law came into\r\noperation on January 1st, 1856.\r\n\r\n{PROHIBITORY LIQUOR ACT}\r\n\r\nThe passage of the prohibitory law was a bold experiment, and, as the\r\nsequel showed, more bold than wise. The temperance movement in New\r\nBrunswick, at that time, was hardly more than twenty years old, and New\r\nBrunswick had always been a province in which the consumption of liquor\r\nwas large in proportion to its population. When it was first settled by\r\nthe Loyalists, and for many years afterwards, the use of liquor was\r\nconsidered necessary to happiness, if not to actual existence. Every\r\nperson consumed spirits, which generally came to the province in the\r\nform of Jamaica rum, from the West Indies, and as this rum was supposed\r\nto be an infallible cure for nearly every ill that flesh is heir to,\r\nnothing could be done at that time without its use. Large quantities of\r\nrum were taken into the woods for the lumbermen, to give them sufficient\r\nstrength to perform the laborious work in which they were engaged, and\r\nif it had been suggested that a time would come when the same work would\r\nbe done without any more powerful stimulant than tea, the person who\r\nventured to make such a suggestion would have been regarded as foolish.\r\nExperience has shown that more and better work can be done, not only in\r\nthe woods, but everywhere else, without the use of stimulants than with\r\nthem; but no one could be persuaded to believe this sixty years ago.\r\nEvery kind of work connected with the farm then had to be performed by\r\nthe aid of liquor. Every house-raising, every ploughing match, every\r\nmeeting at which farmers congregated, had unlimited quantities of rum as\r\none of its leading features. It was also used by almost every man as a\r\npart of his regular diet; the old stagers had their eleven-o'clock dram\r\nand their nip before dinner; their regular series of drinks in the\r\nafternoon and evening; and they actually believed that without them life\r\nwould not be worth living. Some idea of the extent of the\r\nspirit-drinking of the province may be gathered from the fact that, in\r\n1838, when the population did not exceed 120,000, 312,298 gallons of\r\nrum, gin and whiskey, and 64,579 gallons of brandy were consumed in New\r\nBrunswick. Spirits, especially rum, were very cheap, and, the duty being\r\nonly thirty cents a gallon, every one could afford to drink it if\r\ndisposed to do so.\r\n\r\nIt was at midnight on December 31st, 1855, when the bells rang out a\r\nmerry peal to announce the advent of the New Year, that this law went\r\ninto force. This meant little less than a revolution in the views,\r\nfeelings and ideas of the people of the province, and, to a large\r\nextent, in their business relations. The liquor trade, both wholesale\r\nand retail, employed large numbers of men, and occupied many buildings\r\nwhich brought in large rents to their owners. The number of taverns in\r\nSt. John and its suburb, Portland, was not less than two hundred, and\r\nevery one of these establishments had to be closed. There were probably\r\nat least twenty men who sold liquor at wholesale, and who extended their\r\nbusiness to every section of the province, as well as to parts of Nova\r\nScotia, and their operations also had to come to an end. It was not to\r\nbe supposed that these people would consent to be deprived suddenly of\r\ntheir means of living, especially in view of the fact that it was by no\r\nmeans certain that the sentiment in favour of prohibition was as strong\r\nin the country as it appeared to be in the legislature. It has always\r\nbeen understood that many men voted for prohibition in the House of\r\nAssembly who themselves were not total abstainers, but who thought they\r\nmight make political capital by taking that course, and who relied on\r\nthe legislative council to throw out the bill. No men were more\r\ndisgusted and disappointed than they when the council passed the bill.\r\n\r\n{PROHIBITORY ACT UNPOPULAR}\r\n\r\nThe result of the attempt to enforce prohibition was what might have\r\nbeen expected. The law was resisted, liquor continued to be sold, and\r\nwhen attempts were made to prevent the violation of the law, and the\r\nviolators of the law were brought before the courts, able lawyers were\r\nemployed to defend them, while the sale of liquor by the same parties\r\nwas continued, thus setting the law at defiance. This state of confusion\r\nlasted for several months, but it is unnecessary to go into details. In\r\nthe city of St. John, especially, the conflict became bitter to the last\r\ndegree, and it was evident that, however admirable prohibition might be\r\nof itself, the people of that city were not then prepared to accept it.\r\nAt this juncture came the astounding news that the lieutenant-governor,\r\nthe Hon. H. T. Manners-Sutton, had dissolved the House of Assembly\r\nagainst the advice of his council. This governor, who had been appointed\r\nthe year previous, was a member of an old Conservative family, one of\r\nwhom was speaker of the British House of Commons for a great many years.\r\nThe traditions of this family were all opposed to such a radical measure\r\nas the prohibitory law, and, therefore, it was not to be expected that\r\nManners-Sutton, who drank wine at his own table, and who considered that\r\nits use was proper and necessary, would be favourable to the law. But\r\neven if he had been disposed to favour it originally, or to regard it\r\nwithout prejudice, the confusion which it caused in the province when\r\nthe attempt was made to enforce it, would naturally incline him to look\r\nupon it as an evil. At all events, he came to the conclusion that the\r\npeople should have another opportunity of pronouncing upon it, and, as\r\nthe result of this view of the situation, resolved to dissolve the\r\nlegislature, which had been elected only a little more than a year, and\r\nhad still three years to run.\r\n\r\n{DISSOLUTION OF LEGISLATURE}\r\n\r\nThe election which followed in July, 1856, was perhaps the most hotly\r\ncontested that has ever taken place in the province. In St. John,\r\nespecially, the conflict was fierce and bitter, because it was in this\r\ncity that the liquor interest was strongest and most influential. All\r\nover the province, however, the people became interested in the\r\nstruggle, as they had not been in any previous campaign.\r\n\r\nBy the Liberals and friends of the government, the action of Governor\r\nSutton was denounced as tyrannical, unjust and entirely contrary to the\r\nprinciples of responsible government. On the other hand, the friends of\r\nthe governor and of the liquor interest declared that his action was\r\nright, and the cry of \"Support the governor,\" was raised in every\r\ncounty. At this day it is easy enough to discern that there was a good\r\ndeal of unnecessary violence injected into the campaign, and that\r\nneither party was inclined to do full justice to the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nREFORM AND PROGRESS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe result of the election was the defeat of the government. Mr. Tilley\r\nlost his seat for St. John city, and the Hon. James Brown, the\r\nsurveyor-general, was rejected by the county of Charlotte, so that two\r\nof the principal members of the executive were not in their places when\r\nthe House was called together in July. The city of St. John, and the\r\ncity and county of St. John, sent a solid phalanx of six members opposed\r\nto prohibition, and an Act repealing the prohibitory liquor law was\r\npassed by a vote of thirty-eight to two. The new government which was\r\nformed had for its principal members, the Hon. John H. Gray, who became\r\nattorney-general; the Hon. John C. Allen, solicitor-general; the Hon. R.\r\nD. Wilmot, provincial secretary; the Hon. John Montgomery,\r\nsurveyor-general, and the Hon. Francis McPhelim, postmaster-general. The\r\nother members of the executive council were the Hon. Edward B. Chandler,\r\nthe Hon. Robert L. Hazen and the Hon. Charles McPherson.\r\n\r\nWhen the House met in July, the Hon. Charles Simonds, of St. John, was\r\nelected speaker, and it was soon discovered, after the liquor bill had\r\nbeen disposed of, that the majority supporting the government was so\r\nsmall as to make it impossible for them to accomplish any useful\r\nlegislation. When the legislature again met, in the early part of 1857,\r\nit was seen that in a House of forty-one members twenty were arrayed\r\nagainst the government, and the only way in which government business\r\ncould be done was by the casting vote of the speaker. This condition of\r\naffairs speedily became intolerable, because it practically made\r\nlegislation impossible, but it was brought to an end by Mr. McMonagle,\r\none of the members for the county of Kings, withdrawing his support from\r\nthe government. Two courses only were now open to them, to tender their\r\nresignations or advise the dissolution of the legislature, and they\r\nchose the latter. The House of Assembly was dissolved by proclamation on\r\nApril 1st, 1857, and the writs for the election were made returnable on\r\nMay 16th.\r\n\r\n{THE FISHER GOVERNMENT}\r\n\r\nThe excitement attending this second election was, if possible, even\r\ngreater than during the election of 1856, for the public mind had been\r\nwrought up to a high state of tension by the proceedings in the House\r\nand the numerous divisions in which the government was supported only by\r\nthe casting vote of the speaker. The result of the election was so\r\nunfavourable to the Gray-Wilmot government that they at once tendered\r\ntheir resignations to the lieutenant-governor, agreeing to hold office\r\nonly until their successors were appointed. The most bitter contest of\r\nthe election centred in the city of St. John, and it resulted in the\r\nelection of Mr. Tilley, with Mr. James A. Harding for his colleague, the\r\nlatter having changed his views in regard to the question at issue since\r\nthe previous election, when he was chosen as an opponent of the\r\ngovernment of which Tilley had been a member. When the Gray-Wilmot\r\ngovernment resigned, the lieutenant-governor sent for Mr. Fisher, and\r\nentrusted to him the business of forming a new government. The\r\ngovernment thus formed comprised the Hons. James Brown, S. L. Tilley,\r\nWilliam Henry Steeves, John M. Johnson, Albert J. Smith, David Wark and\r\nCharles Watters. The Hon. Charles Fisher became attorney-general, and,\r\nresigning his seat, was reëlected for the county of York prior to the\r\nmeeting of the legislature on June 24th, 1857. The session lasted only\r\nuntil July 1st, being merely held for the purpose of disposing of the\r\nnecessary business. James A. Harding was elected speaker of the House,\r\nand the legislation was confined to the passage of the supply bills, and\r\nmatters that were urgent. Tilley took no part in the legislation of this\r\nsession, for his seat immediately became vacant by his appointment as\r\nprovincial secretary. The other departments were filled by the\r\nappointment of Mr. Brown to the office of surveyor-general; of Mr.\r\nCharles Watters, to the office of solicitor-general, and of John M.\r\nJohnson as postmaster-general.\r\n\r\nThe legislature met again on February 10th, 1858, and the speech from\r\nthe throne dealt mainly with the financial crisis, the Intercolonial\r\nRailway, and the progress that was being made in the construction of the\r\nline between St. John and Shediac as a part of what was termed the\r\nEuropean and North American Railway. The speech also referred to the\r\nfact that the surplus civil list fund had been, by arrangement with the\r\nBritish government made the previous year, placed at the disposal of the\r\nHouse of Assembly. It was soon seen that the government was strong in\r\nthe House, the first test vote being that taken on the passage of the\r\naddress in reply to the speech from the throne. This came in the form of\r\nan amendment, regretting that the arrangement in regard to the surplus\r\ncivil list fund had been acceded to without the consent of the House.\r\nThis amendment to the address received the support of only six members.\r\nA return brought down at an early period in the session showed that the\r\nrevenue of the province for the fiscal year, ending October 31st, 1857,\r\namounted to $668,252 an increase of $86,528 over the previous year. Of\r\nthis sum upwards of $540,000 came from import duties and what were\r\ntermed railway impost, which was simply duties levied on imports for the\r\npurpose of defraying the cost of the railways then building. The casual\r\nand territorial revenue yielded only eighteen thousand pounds but the\r\nexport duties reached almost twenty thousand pounds.\r\n\r\n{INTERCOLONIAL RAILWAY}\r\n\r\nThe Intercolonial Railway still continued to engage the attention of the\r\nlegislature, and correspondence with the secretary of state, with the\r\ngovernment of Canada, and with the government of Nova Scotia, in regard\r\nto this great work, was laid before the House soon after the session\r\nopened. The government of New Brunswick consulted with the governments\r\nof Canada and Nova Scotia as to what assistance should be given by the\r\nimperial government towards the construction of the Intercolonial\r\nRailway from Halifax to Quebec, in the form of a guarantee of interest.\r\nThe British government professed to feel a strong sense of the\r\nimportance of the object, but thought they would not be justified in\r\napplying to parliament for the required guarantee, because the heavy\r\nexpenditures to which Great Britain had been subjected did not leave\r\nthem at liberty to pledge its revenue for the purpose of assisting in\r\nthe construction of public works of this description, however desirable\r\nin themselves. The correspondence on the subject of the Intercolonial\r\nRailway extended over a period of more than twenty years and grew to\r\nenormous proportions, but it is safe to assert that this line of railway\r\nwould not have been constructed in the nineteenth century but for the\r\nfact that it was undertaken by the Canadian Dominion as a work which had\r\nto be built for the purpose of carrying out the terms of confederation\r\nas set out in the British North America Act (section 145).\r\n\r\nThe railway to Shediac was finally completed and opened for traffic on\r\nAugust 5th, 1860, its length being one hundred and eight miles. The\r\nnineteen miles between Pointe du Chêne and Moncton had been open as\r\nearly as August, 1857, and the nine miles from St. John to Rothesay, on\r\nJune 1st, 1858. The railway was opened from St. John to Hampton in June,\r\n1859, and to Sussex in November of the same year. Although the people of\r\nthe province had abated something of their enthusiasm for railways by\r\nthe time the St. John and Shediac line was finished, still its opening\r\nwas a great event, because it was the commencement of a new era in\r\ntransportation and gave St. John access to the north shore, from which\r\nit had previously been practically shut out. Goods could now be sent by\r\nmeans of railway and steamer to Prince Edward Island, and to the New\r\nBrunswick ports on the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and a community of interest\r\nwhich did not exist before was thus created between the most remote\r\nsections of the province.\r\n\r\nThe traffic receipts of the complete line were thought to be highly\r\nsatisfactory; the business for the first three months amounted to about\r\n$45,000, and yielded a revenue of $18,000. This was a good showing and\r\ngave promise of still better things for the future. It may be\r\ninteresting to state that in the last year that the railway was operated\r\nby the government of the province, the gross receipts amounted to\r\n$148,330, and the net receipts to $51,760. The gross and net revenue of\r\nthe road had shown a steady increase from the first, and although it had\r\nbeen a costly public work the people of the province considered it a\r\ngood investment. It was only after it had passed into the hands of the\r\ngovernment of Canada, and become a part of the Intercolonial Railway,\r\nthat any colour was given to the accusation that it was an unprofitable\r\nline. The railway from St. John to Shediac had always paid well, and\r\nprobably, if dissociated from its connecting lines, would at this day\r\npay three or four per cent, upon its original cost.\r\n\r\n{THE BALLOT}\r\n\r\nThe legislation of the province between 1858 and 1861, although it\r\nincluded many useful measures, evolved nothing that calls for particular\r\nmention, with the exception of the law which provided for voting by\r\nballot. This was an innovation to which many were opposed, but which the\r\nLiberal party very properly considered necessary to the protection of\r\nthe voter, who was liable to be coerced by his employer, or by those who\r\nhad financial relations with him. The ballot system introduced by the\r\ngovernment was quite imperfect and did not insure absolute secrecy,\r\nbecause it did not provide for an official ballot such as is required in\r\nthe system of election which now prevails in connection with the choice\r\nof members to our Canadian parliament. Yet it was a vast improvement on\r\nopen voting, not only because it gave the voter a certain degree of\r\nprotection, but also from the fact that it tended to promote order at\r\nelections, and to do away with that riotous spirit which was\r\ncharacteristic of the earlier contests in the province.\r\n\r\n{UNIVERSITY OF NEW BRUNSWICK}\r\n\r\nIn 1859 an important step was taken for the reorganization of King's\r\nCollege, which by an Act passed in that year, was changed into the\r\nUniversity of New Brunswick. There had always been a great deal of\r\ndissatisfaction with the college in consequence of its denominational\r\ncharacter, and in 1854 an Act was passed empowering the\r\nlieutenant-governor to appoint a commission to inquire into the state of\r\nKing's College, its management and utility, with a view to improving it.\r\nThe commissioners appointed were the Hon. John H. Gray, the Rev. Egerton\r\nRyerson, J. W. Dawson, the Hon. John S. Saunders and the Hon. James\r\nBrown. The report, which was dated December 28th, 1854, was laid before\r\nboth branches of the legislature in 1855. In 1857 the college council\r\nappointed a committee and prepared a draft of a bill which was laid\r\nbefore the legislature. This, with a few slight alterations, was the\r\nbill which was passed in 1859 for the establishment of the University of\r\nNew Brunswick, and in this bill were embodied the principal\r\nrecommendations of the commissioners appointed in 1854 to enquire into\r\nthe state of the college. This Act transferred to the University of New\r\nBrunswick all the property of King's College and its endowment, and made\r\nthe university liable for the payment of the debts and the performance\r\nof the contracts of King's College. It created a new governing body for\r\nthe college to be styled the senate, to be appointed by the governor in\r\ncouncil, and the president of the college was required to be a member of\r\nthat body and also to be a layman. It conferred upon the senate the\r\npower of appointing the professors and other officers of the university,\r\nexcept the president, and also the power of removing them from office,\r\nsubject to the approval of the governor in council. It also authorized\r\nthe senate to fix their salaries. It abolished the professorship of\r\ntheology and provided for the affiliation of other institutions with the\r\nuniversity, and also for a number of free scholars. This Act, which was\r\npassed in April, 1859, was especially approved by Her Majesty in council\r\non January 25th, 1860. Thus a new era in the higher education of New\r\nBrunswick was commenced, and a long step was taken towards making the\r\ncollege more acceptable to the people of that province. Great hopes were\r\nentertained at the time that this liberalizing of the constitution of\r\nthe college would lead to a large increase in the number of its\r\nstudents, and a more general interest in its work, but, unfortunately,\r\nas the sequel showed, these hopes were only partially realized.\r\n\r\nDuring the spring of 1860 circumstances occurred which led to the\r\nresignation of the postmaster-general, the Hon. Charles Connell. The\r\nlegislature having adopted the decimal system of currency in the place\r\nof the pounds, shillings and pence which had been the currency of the\r\nprovince since its foundation, Mr. Connell, in March, 1860, was\r\nauthorized to obtain a new set of postage stamps of the denominations\r\nrequired for use in the postal service of the province. No person, at\r\nthat time, thought that a political crisis would arise out of this\r\norder, but it appears that Mr. Connell, guided by the example of\r\npresidents and postmasters-general of the United States, had made up his\r\nmind that instead of the likeness of the queen, which had been upon all\r\nthe old postage stamps of the province, the five-cent stamp, the one\r\nwhich would be most in use, should bear the impress of his own\r\ncountenance. Accordingly the Connell postage stamp, which is now one of\r\nthe rarest and most costly of all in the lists of collectors, was\r\nprocured and was ready to be used, when Mr. Connell's colleagues in the\r\ngovernment discovered what was going on and took steps to prevent the\r\nnew five-cent stamp from being issued. The correspondence on the\r\nsubject, which will be found in the journals of 1861, is curious and\r\ninteresting; it ended in the withdrawal of the objectionable stamps and\r\nin the resignation of Mr. Connell, who complained that he had lost the\r\nconfidence of his colleagues, and in resigning, charged them with\r\nneglecting the affairs of the province. Only a few of the Connell stamps\r\ngot into circulation, the remainder of the issue being destroyed. Mr.\r\nConnell's place as postmaster-general was filled by the appointment of\r\nJames Steadman.\r\n\r\n{RESIGNATION OF MR. FISHER}\r\n\r\nIn the early part of 1861 a very important event occurred in connection\r\nwith the government which produced a lasting effect on provincial\r\npolitics. Charges were made by a St. John Conservative paper, _The\r\nColonial Empire_, in which it was stated that members of the government\r\nand certain Crown lands officials had been purchasing the most desirable\r\nand valuable Crown lands of the province for speculative purposes, and\r\nthat in bringing these lands to sale the government regulations had been\r\nviolated and the public treasury had suffered. A committee of the House\r\nwas appointed to investigate these charges, and inquiry established the\r\nfact that an official of the Crown lands department had purchased some\r\neight hundred acres. These lands were all bought at public sale, but in\r\nthe forms of application other names were used, which was a violation of\r\nthe rules of the department. A portion of the press at the time created\r\na widespread excitement upon this subject, and the services of the\r\nofficial referred to were dispensed with. Some of the supporters of the\r\ngovernment also took such ground in reference to the attorney-general,\r\nMr. Fisher, that his retirement from the government became necessary,\r\nthe accusation against him being that he had negligently permitted some\r\nimproper sales of Crown lands to be made. It was felt at the time by\r\nsome that the penalty that was paid by the attorney-general was\r\nexcessive for the offence; but, under the excitement then existing, it\r\nwas the only course that could be taken to avoid the defeat of the\r\ngovernment. At the general election that followed a few months later,\r\nMr. Fisher was reëlected for the county of York, and later on, after the\r\nexcitement had passed over, the delinquent Crown lands official was\r\nreinstated. At the same election, that took place in 1861, the\r\ngovernment was handsomely sustained, after one of the warmest contests\r\nthat had ever taken place in New Brunswick. Probably the most effective\r\nnomination speech ever made by Tilley, during his long political career,\r\nwas the one then delivered at the court-house, St. John, in his own\r\ndefence, and in the vindication of his government against the charges\r\nmade by the Opposition candidates and press.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE INTERCOLONIAL RAILWAY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe imperfect means of communication between the Maritime Provinces and\r\nCanada had long been recognized as a great evil, and very soon after the\r\nintroduction of railways into England a line of railway was projected to\r\nrun from St. Andrews, in New Brunswick, to Quebec. The transfer of a\r\nconsiderable tract of territory, which had been believed to be in New\r\nBrunswick, to the state of Maine, under the terms of the Ashburton\r\nTreaty, gave a check to this enterprise, and financial difficulties\r\nafterwards prevented its accomplishment. A more promising scheme was\r\nthat of a railway from Halifax to Quebec, and this so far received the\r\napproval of the British government that an officer of engineers, Major\r\nRobinson, was, in 1847, detailed to conduct a survey of the proposed\r\nline. As this gentleman was influenced by purely military\r\nconsiderations, his line was carried as far from the United States\r\nboundary as possible, and consequently by a very long and circuitous\r\nroute. During the session of 1852, Attorney-General Street introduced a\r\nseries of resolutions in the New Brunswick legislature favouring the\r\nbuilding of the Intercolonial Railway jointly by Canada, New Brunswick\r\nand Nova Scotia, according to terms which had been agreed upon by the\r\ndelegates of each. This arrangement was that the Intercolonial Railway\r\nshould be built through the valley of the St. John. These resolutions\r\nwere carried by a large majority. During the recess, Mr. Chandler, as\r\nthe representative of New Brunswick, and Mr. Hincks, the representative\r\nof Canada, went to London to endeavour to obtain from the British\r\ngovernment financial aid to build the Intercolonial Railway. This was\r\nrefused on the ground that such a work had to be one of military\r\nnecessity. Further efforts were made in 1855, and again in 1858, to\r\ninfluence the British government in favour of this railway, but without\r\nresult; the answer of Downing Street being that the heavy expenditure\r\ninvolved in the Crimean War prevented the government from assisting in\r\nthe construction of public works, such as the Intercolonial Railway,\r\nhowever desirable in themselves.\r\n\r\n{DELEGATION TO ENGLAND}\r\n\r\nThe effort to secure the construction of the Intercolonial Railway was\r\nrenewed in 1861. At a meeting of delegates representing Canada, Nova\r\nScotia and New Brunswick, which was held at Quebec on September 30th, it\r\nwas resolved that the three governments should renew the offers made to\r\nthe imperial government in 1858 with reference to the Intercolonial\r\nRailway, and that the route to be adopted be decided by the imperial\r\ngovernment. The Hon. Mr. Tilley, who was at this Quebec meeting, was\r\nsent to England as a delegate to confer with the imperial government\r\nwith regard to the railway, while Nova Scotia was represented by the\r\nHon. Joseph Howe, and Canada, by the Hon. P. M. Vankoughnet. The\r\ndelegates reached England in November and placed themselves in\r\ncommunication with the Duke of Newcastle, who was then colonial\r\nsecretary, and they also had interviews with the prime minister, Lord\r\nPalmerston, the chancellor of the exchequer, the secretary of war, and\r\nthe president of the board of trade. While in England, the seizure of\r\nthe commissioners of the southern confederacy, Messrs. Mason and\r\nSlidell, by Commodore Wilkes, on board the British mail steamer _Trent_,\r\nproduced a crisis in the relations between Great Britain and the United\r\nStates which seemed likely to lead to a war, and greatly strengthened\r\nthe position of the delegates, who were able to point out the difficulty\r\ninvolved in defending Canada without a railway to the sea. They\r\npresented their views to the colonial secretary in a very ably written\r\nstate paper, which should have convinced those to whom it was addressed\r\nthat the railway was an absolute necessity. The delegates estimated the\r\ncost of the railway at £3,000,000 sterling, and they asked the imperial\r\ngovernment to join in a guarantee of four per cent. interest on this\r\nsum, each of the provinces to guarantee £20,000 a year for this purpose\r\nand the imperial government, £60,000. This proposal was rejected by the\r\nBritish government, but it offered \"an imperial guarantee of interest\r\ntowards enabling them to raise by public loan, at a moderate rate, the\r\nrequisite funds for constructing the railway.\" The British government,\r\ntherefore, would do nothing for this great work except to indorse the\r\nbonds of the provinces to a limited extent, for it was stated in the\r\nDuke of Newcastle's letter to the delegates that \"the nature and extent\r\nof the guarantee must be determined by the particulars of any scheme\r\nwhich the provincial governments may be disposed to found on the present\r\nproposal and on the kind of security which they would offer.\"\r\n\r\nDelegates representing the three provinces met in Quebec in September,\r\n1862, to consider this offer, New Brunswick being represented by Messrs.\r\nTilley, Steeves and Mitchell. The delegates from the Maritime Provinces\r\ndeclared their willingness to propose to their respective governments to\r\naccept the proposition of the Duke of Newcastle if Canada would bear\r\none-half of the expense of the railway instead of one-third. The\r\nCanadian government offered to assume five-twelfths of the liability for\r\nthe construction and working of the Intercolonial, and to this the\r\ndelegates for New Brunswick and Nova Scotia had to agree. This imposed a\r\nvery serious burthen on two provinces, which, between them, had only six\r\nhundred thousand inhabitants, and their willingness to assume it shows\r\nthe interest they took in this great work.\r\n\r\n{NEGOTIATIONS IN ENGLAND}\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of an arrangement made at this Quebec meeting, delegates\r\nfrom the three provinces went to England to arrange the terms of the\r\nguarantee with the British government; the Hon. Mr. Tilley represented\r\nNew Brunswick, and the Hon. Joseph Howe, Nova Scotia. Mr. Gladstone, who\r\nwas then chancellor of the exchequer, insisted on a sinking fund being\r\nprovided, which was to be a first charge on the revenues of the several\r\nprovinces. This sinking fund was objected to by the colonial delegates,\r\nbut the only modification in its terms which they were able to obtain\r\nwas that the sinking fund was not to take precedence of any existing\r\nliability. Before leaving England, Messrs. Tilley and Howe prepared and\r\nsubmitted a memorandum to the Duke of Newcastle in which they expressed\r\na hope that Mr. Gladstone might be induced to reconsider the matter of\r\nthe sinking fund, and that it would not be insisted on. The Canadian\r\ndelegates left England without an acceptance of the terms proposed by\r\nMr. Gladstone, and without a formal rejection of them. Previous to the\r\nmeeting of the Canadian parliament, Tilley proceeded to Quebec to urge\r\nupon the Canadian government the preparation of the necessary bills to\r\ncarry out the agreement entered into for the construction of this great\r\nrailway. He reported to the lieutenant-governor on his return that the\r\ngovernment of Canada, for reasons stated, could not then undertake to\r\npass the legislation required, which they greatly regretted, but that\r\nthey had not abandoned the arrangements for the construction of the\r\nrailway. The Canadian government's declaration in the course of the\r\nsession that they had abandoned this important enterprise was,\r\naccordingly, a source of great surprise and regret. The governments of\r\nNew Brunswick and Nova Scotia passed the necessary legislation at the\r\nnext session, but the government of Canada took no further step in the\r\nmatter until the confederation negotiations were commenced in 1864.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE MOVEMENT FOR MARITIME UNION\r\n\r\n\r\nWe now come down to an event of the greatest interest, in which Mr.\r\nTilley took part, and one of such vast and far-reaching importance that\r\nit quite overshadows all the other events of his career. The\r\nconfederation of the Canadian provinces was, beyond all question, the\r\nmost notable colonial movement within the British empire since the\r\nAmerican Declaration of Independence. It changed at once the whole\r\ncharacter of the colonial relations which had subsisted with the mother\r\ncountry, and substituted for a few weak and scattered colonies a\r\npowerful Dominion, able to speak with a united voice, and stand as a\r\nhelpmeet to the nation from which most of its people had sprung. No man,\r\nwhatever his views as to the wisdom of that political union may have\r\nbeen at the time, can now deny that it was timely and necessary, if the\r\ncolonies and the mother country were to preserve their connection with\r\neach other. It is safe to say that, if confederation had not taken place\r\nin 1867, British interests on this continent would have suffered, and\r\npossibly some of the colonies would now have been a part of the United\r\nStates. The policy of separating the colonies from England, which has\r\nbeen so much advocated by many leading public men in the great republic,\r\nwould have found free scope, and by balancing the interests of one\r\ncolony against those of another, promoting dissensions and favouring\r\nthose provinces which were disposed to a closer union with the United\r\nStates, something might have been done to weaken their connection with\r\nthe British empire, which is now the glory and the strength of the\r\nDominion of Canada.\r\n\r\nThe question of the union of the several colonies of British North\r\nAmerica was by no means a new one when it came up for final settlement.\r\nIt had been discussed at a very early period in the history of the\r\nprovinces, and indeed it was a question which it was quite natural to\r\ndiscuss, for it seemed but reasonable that colonies of the same origin,\r\nowing the same allegiance, inhabited by people who differed but little\r\nfrom each other in any respect, and with many commercial interests in\r\ncommon, should form a political union. No doubt it might have been\r\nbrought earlier to the front as a vital political question but for the\r\nfact that the British government, which was most interested in promoting\r\nthe union of the colonies, took no step towards that end until almost\r\ncompelled by necessity to move in the matter. The colonial policy of\r\nEngland, as represented by the colonial office and in the royal\r\ninstructions to colonial governors, has seldom been wise or far-seeing,\r\nand the British colonies which now girdle the world, have been built up\r\nmainly as the result of private enterprise; for the part taken by the\r\ngovernment has, in most cases, been merely to give official sanction to\r\nwhat private individuals have already done, and to assist in protecting\r\nBritish interests when they have become important, especially in new\r\nregions of the world.\r\n\r\n{CONFEDERATION FORESHADOWED}\r\n\r\nWhen the Earl of Durham was sent out as governor-general of Canada after\r\nthe rebellion there in 1838, he suggested in his report that the union\r\nof the colonies of British North America was one of the remedies which\r\nought to be resorted to for the pacification of Canada and the\r\nreconstruction of its constitution. While a large proportion of the\r\npeople of the colonies looked with favour upon the idea of a political\r\nunion, there was in all of them a large body of objectors who were\r\nsteadily opposed to it. People of that kind are to be found in all\r\ncountries, and they have existed in all ages of the world's history.\r\nThey are the persons who see in every new movement a thousand\r\ndifficulties which cannot be surmounted. Their minds are constructed on\r\nthe principle of rejecting all new ideas, and clinging to old forms and\r\nsystems long after they have lost their vitality. They are a class who\r\nlook back for precedents for any step of a political character which it\r\nis proposed to take, and who judge of everything by the standard of some\r\nformer age. They seem to forget that precedents must be created some\r\ntime or another, and that the present century has as good a right to\r\ncreate precedents as any of its predecessors. To these people every\r\nobjection that could be urged against confederation was exaggerated and\r\nmagnified, and whenever any proposal was made which seemed to tend\r\ntowards the union of the colonies, their voices were heard upon the\r\nother side. We need not doubt the honesty or loyalty of these objectors,\r\nor consider that they were unfavourable either to British connection or\r\nto the building up of the empire. It was merely their misfortune that\r\nthey were constitutionally adverse to change, and could not see any\r\nmerit in a political movement which involved the idea of novelty.\r\n\r\nFor some time the principal advocate of confederation in the Maritime\r\nProvinces was the Hon. Joseph Howe, a man of such ability and force of\r\ncharacter that on a wider stage he might have risen to eminence, and\r\nranked amongst the world's great statesmen.[10] It is impossible indeed\r\nnot to regret that so great a man, one so imperial in his instincts and\r\nviews, should have been condemned to spend his life within the bounds of\r\none small province.\r\n\r\n{ATTITUDE OF COLONIAL OFFICE}\r\n\r\nThe question of the political union of the British North American\r\nprovinces was brought up in the House of Assembly of Nova Scotia in\r\n1854, and then the leaders of both parties, the Hon. Mr. Johnson for the\r\nConservatives, and the Hon. Mr. Howe for the Liberals, united in\r\nadvocating the measure, and in depicting the advantage which would\r\naccrue from it not only to Nova Scotia, but to every British province in\r\nNorth America. In 1858 the question of confederation was discussed in\r\nthe parliament of Canada, and such a union was made a part of the policy\r\nof the government; for Mr. A. T. Galt, on becoming a member of the\r\nadministration, insisted upon its being made a cabinet question, and Sir\r\nEdmund Head, the governor-general, in his speech at the close of the\r\nsession, intimated that his government would take action in the matter\r\nduring the recess. Messrs. Cartier, Galt, and Ross, who were in England\r\nrepresenting the government of Canada, waited upon the colonial\r\nsecretary, Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton, asking the authority of the\r\nimperial government for a meeting of representatives from each of the\r\ncolonies to take the question of union into consideration. The colonial\r\nsecretary informed the Canadian delegates, no doubt after consultation\r\nwith his colleagues, that the question of confederation was necessarily\r\none of an imperial character, and declined to authorize the meeting,\r\nbecause no expression of sentiment on the subject had as yet been\r\nreceived from any of the Maritime Provinces except Nova Scotia. The Earl\r\nof Derby's government fell a few months after this declaration of its\r\npolicy in regard to the colonies, and was succeeded by the government of\r\nLord Palmerston, which was in office at the time when the negotiations\r\nwhich resulted in the confederation of the colonies were commenced. At\r\nfirst Lord Palmerston's government seems to have been no more favourable\r\nto the union of the colonies than its predecessor; for in 1862 the Duke\r\nof Newcastle, then colonial secretary, in a despatch to the\r\ngovernor-general of Canada, after stating that Her Majesty's government\r\nwas not prepared to announce any definite policy on the question of\r\nconfederation, added that, \"If a union, either partial or complete,\r\nshould hereafter be proposed, with the concurrence of all the provinces\r\nto be united, I am sure that the matter would be weighed in this country\r\nboth by the public, by parliament and by Her Majesty's government, with\r\nno other feeling than an anxiety to discern and promote any course which\r\nmight be the most conducive to the prosperity, strength and harmony of\r\nall the British communities of North America.\" It must always be a\r\nsubject of astonishment that the British government for so many years\r\nshould have had no definite policy on a matter so momentous, and that\r\nthey should have sought to discourage, rather than otherwise, a project\r\nwhich has been of such vast importance to the empire.\r\n\r\nThe first impulse in favour of confederation in the minds of the members\r\nof Lord Palmerston's cabinet seems to have developed about the time when\r\nit became evident that the result of the civil war in the United States\r\nwould be the defeat of the southern confederacy and the consolidation\r\nof the power of the great republic in a more effectual union than that\r\nwhich had existed before. No one who was not blind could fail to see\r\nthat this change of attitude on the part of the United States would\r\ndemand a corresponding change in the relations of the British colonies\r\ntowards each other; for from being a mere federation of states, so\r\nloosely connected that secession was frequently threatened by states\r\nboth north and south, the United States, as the result of the war, had\r\nbecome a nation with a strong central government, which had taken to\r\nitself powers never contemplated by the constitution, and which added\r\nimmensely to its offensive and defensive strength.\r\n\r\n{A MISSIONARY OF UNION}\r\n\r\nIn 1863, Thomas D'Arcy McGee, a member of the Canadian cabinet and a man\r\nof great eloquence and ability, visited St. John and delivered a lecture\r\nin the Mechanics' Institute Hall on the subject of the union of the\r\ncolonies. His lecture was fully reported in the _Morning News_, a paper\r\nthen published in that city, and attracted wide attention because it\r\nopened up a subject of the highest interest for the contemplation of the\r\npeople of the provinces. Shortly afterwards a series of articles on the\r\nsame subject, written by the author of this book, appeared in the\r\ncolumns of the _Morning News_, and were widely read and quoted. These\r\narticles followed closely the lines laid down for the union of the\r\ncolonies by the late Peter S. Hamilton, of Halifax, a writer of ability\r\nwhose articles on the subject were collected in pamphlet form and\r\nextensively circulated. Thus in various ways the public mind was being\r\neducated on the question of confederation, and the opinion that the\r\nunion of the British North American colonies was desirable was generally\r\naccepted by all persons who gave any attention to the subject. It was\r\nonly when the matter came up in a practical form and as a distinct\r\nproposition to be carried into effect, that the violent opposition which\r\nwas afterwards developed against confederation began to be shown.\r\n\r\nAn event occurred in the summer of 1864 which had its effect on the\r\nquestion of confederation. Up to that time the people of Canada and New\r\nBrunswick had been almost wholly unknown to each other, because the\r\ndifficulties of travelling between the two provinces were so great. Any\r\nperson who desired to reach Montreal at that time from St. John had to\r\ntake the international steamer to Portland, Me., and was then carried by\r\nthe Grand Trunk Railway to his destination. Quebec could be reached in\r\nsummer by the steamer from Pictou which called at Shediac, but in winter\r\nthe journey had to be made by the Grand Trunk Railway from Portland, the\r\nonly alternative route being the road by which the mails were carried\r\nfrom Edmunston north to the St. Lawrence. Under these circumstances the\r\npeople of the Canadian provinces and of the Maritime Provinces had but\r\nfew opportunities of seeing each other, and the people of all the\r\nprovinces knew much more of their neighbours in the United States than\r\nthey did of their fellow-colonists. One result of the Hon. D'Arcy\r\nMcGee's visit in 1863 was an invitation by the city of St. John to the\r\nlegislature of Canada to visit the Maritime Provinces. The invitation\r\nwas accepted and a party of about one hundred, comprising members of the\r\nlegislature, newspaper men, and others, visited St. John in the\r\nbeginning of August, 1864. Their trip was extended to Fredericton, where\r\nthey were the guests of the government of New Brunswick, and to Halifax,\r\nwhere they were the guests of that city and of the government of Nova\r\nScotia. This visit produced a good effect upon the public mind, and\r\nenabled the Maritime people to see what kind of men their\r\nfellow-colonists of Upper and Lower Canada were.\r\n\r\n{POLITICAL CRISIS IN CANADA}\r\n\r\nIn the meantime a great crisis had arisen in the government of Canada,\r\nwhich was the immediate cause of the active part which that province\r\ntook in the confederation movement. When Upper and Lower Canada were\r\nunited in 1841, it was arranged that the representation of each province\r\nin the legislature should be equal. The arrangement at that time was\r\nfavourable to Upper Canada, which had a smaller population than Lower\r\nCanada; but in the course of time, as the population of Upper Canada\r\nincreased faster than that of the lower province, the people of Upper\r\nCanada felt that they had less representation than they were entitled\r\nto, and this state of affairs led to the raising of the cry of\r\n\"Representation by Population\" which was so often heard in that province\r\nprior to the era of confederation. In 1864 Upper Canada had half a\r\nmillion more people than Lower Canada, and yet was only entitled to the\r\nsame number of members in the legislature. Another serious difficulty,\r\nwhich arose out of the union, was the necessity, which not long\r\nafterwards began to be recognized, of the government having a majority\r\nin the legislature from each section of the province. This, in time,\r\ngrew to be so great an evil that the successful government of Canada\r\nbecame almost impossible, for the majority for the government in one\r\nprovince might at any time be disturbed by some local feeling, and as a\r\nconsequence the government overthrown. To trace the history of the\r\ndifficulties which arose from this cause would be to recite twenty years\r\nof the history of Canada; but it is only necessary to point out thus\r\nplainly the reasons for the willingness of the people of Upper and Lower\r\nCanada to resort to confederation as a means of getting rid of their\r\nembarrassments.\r\n\r\n{MACDONALD-BROWN COALITION}\r\n\r\nIn 1863, the Hon. John Sandfield Macdonald was leader of the government,\r\nbut he was compelled to resign when parliament met in the early part of\r\n1864, and in March of that year a new administration under the\r\npremiership of Sir E. P. Taché was formed. This new government\r\ndeveloped very little strength, and was defeated on June 14th by a vote\r\nof fifty-eight to sixty, on a question relative to some transaction\r\nconnected with bonds of the city of Montreal. A deadlock had come, and\r\nas it was evident that no new government which could be formed was\r\nlikely to command sufficient support, it became necessary to make some\r\nnew arrangements in regard to the system of administration. Immediately\r\nafter the defeat of the government, Mr. George Brown, leader of the\r\nOpposition, spoke to several supporters of the administration strongly\r\nurging that the present time should be availed of for the purpose of\r\nsettling forever the constitutional difficulties between Upper and Lower\r\nCanada, and assuring them that he was prepared to coöperate with the\r\nexisting or any other administration that would deal with the question\r\npromptly and firmly, with a view to its final settlement. After much\r\nnegotiation Messrs. Brown, Mowat and McDougall, three prominent members\r\nof the Reform party, agreed to enter the government for the purpose of\r\ncarrying out this policy based on a federal union of all the provinces.\r\n\r\n{SCHEME OF MARITIME UNION}\r\n\r\nPrior to this time there had been various efforts made by the government\r\nof New Brunswick to enter into closer relations with Nova Scotia and\r\nPrince Edward Island. Previous to the year 1861 a number of factories of\r\nvarious kinds had been established in the Maritime Provinces, but the\r\nlimited market they then enjoyed prevented their extension and crippled\r\ntheir operations. To remedy this, Mr. Tilley, with the approval of his\r\ncolleagues in the government, visited Nova Scotia and Prince Edward\r\nIsland and proposed to the governments of both provinces free admission\r\nof their natural products and a uniform tariff on dutiable goods. In\r\nHalifax he had a lengthy and satisfactory conference with Mr. Howe, then\r\nleader of the government, and with Dr. Tupper, the leader of the\r\nOpposition. Both gentlemen agreed that the proposed arrangements would\r\nbe in the interests of the three provinces, and Mr. Howe agreed to\r\nsubmit the matter to his government with the view of legislative action\r\nat the next session. Mr. Tilley then proceeded to Charlottetown, Prince\r\nEdward Island. At the conference held with the government there, his\r\nproposal was not so favourably entertained, the objection being that the\r\nexisting tariff of Prince Edward Island was lower than the tariff of\r\neither Nova Scotia or New Brunswick, and sufficient for the financial\r\nwants of the Island, and that the necessary advance would be imposing\r\ntaxation beyond their requirements. Notwithstanding the failure to\r\nsecure the coöperation of the Island government, it was decided that the\r\njoint action of the Nova Scotia and New Brunswick legislatures in the\r\ndirection named was desirable. When the Nova Scotia legislature met and\r\nthe public accounts were proposed, it was found that a reduction of\r\ntariff was not practicable, and Howe informed Tilley that the scheme\r\nwould have to be postponed, \"though in other respects desirable.\" But\r\nthe subject was not allowed to sleep, and in 1864 there was a renewal of\r\nthe movement for a union of the Maritime Provinces. At the session of\r\nthe New Brunswick legislature held that year, resolutions were passed\r\nauthorizing the government to enter into negotiations with Nova Scotia\r\nand Prince Edward Island to hold a convention for the purpose of\r\ncarrying such a union into effect. Similar resolutions were carried in\r\nthe legislatures of Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, and the\r\nconvention thus authorized was appointed to meet at Charlottetown in the\r\nmonth of September following.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[10] For a full account of Howe's views on confederation see the Hon. J.\r\nW. Longley's _Joseph Howe_ in this series.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE QUEBEC CONFERENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe delegates appointed by the government of New Brunswick for the\r\npurpose of representing the provinces at Charlottetown in the convention\r\nfor a union of the Maritime Provinces, were the Hon. Messrs. Tilley,\r\nSteeves, Johnson, Chandler and Gray. The first three were members of the\r\ngovernment, while Messrs. Gray and Chandler were leading members of the\r\nOpposition, so that the arrangement had the assent of the leaders of\r\nboth political parties and was in no sense a party movement. The Nova\r\nScotia delegation consisted of the Hon. Charles Tupper, the leader of\r\nthe government, the attorney-general, Mr. Henry, and Mr. Dickey, a\r\nConservative supporter, and also the Hon. Adams G. Archibald and\r\nJonathan McCully, leaders of the Liberal party. The Prince Edward Island\r\ndelegates were also chosen from both sides of politics. The convention\r\nwas opened in due form at Charlottetown on September 8th, in the chamber\r\nof the House of Assembly. The delegations had no power to decide finally\r\non any subject, because any arrangements they made were necessarily\r\nsubject to the approval of the legislatures of the three Maritime\r\nProvinces. But at this time the sentiment in favour of maritime union\r\nwas so strong it was confidently believed that whatever was agreed upon\r\nat Charlottetown would become the basis of a future union.\r\n\r\n{CHARLOTTETOWN CONVENTION}\r\n\r\nThe government of Canada had full knowledge of what was going on at\r\nCharlottetown, and they considered the time opportune for the purpose of\r\nbringing to the notice of the delegates from the Maritime Provinces the\r\nsubject of a confederation of all the British North American colonies. A\r\ntelegram was received while the delegates were in session announcing\r\nthat representatives of the government of Canada had left Quebec for the\r\npurpose of meeting the delegates of the Maritime Provinces, and placing\r\ncertain proposals before them. On the receipt of this message the\r\nfurther consideration of the question which they had met to discuss was\r\ndeferred until after the Canadian delegates had arrived. They came in\r\nthe government steamer _Victoria_ on the following day and were found to\r\nembrace the leading men then in Canadian political life,--the Hons. J.\r\nA. Macdonald, George Brown, Georges E. Cartier, Alexander T. Galt,\r\nThomas D'Arcy McGee, Hector L. Langevin, William McDougall and Alexander\r\nCampbell. These delegates represented the Reform, as well as the\r\nConservative party, and were therefore able to speak with authority in\r\nregard to the views of the people of both Upper and Lower Canada. They\r\nwere accorded seats in the convention, and at once submitted reasons\r\nwhy in their opinion a scheme of union, embracing the whole of the\r\nBritish North American colonies, should be adopted. The Hon. John A.\r\nMacdonald and Messrs. Brown and Cartier were heard on this subject, the\r\nfinancial position of Canada was explained, and the sources of revenue\r\nand wealth of the several provinces were discussed. Speeches were also\r\nmade by Messrs. Galt, McGee, Langevin and McDougall, and after having\r\ncommanded the attention of the convention for two days the Canadian\r\ndeputation withdrew. Before doing so they proposed that if the\r\nconvention concluded to suspend its deliberations upon the question of\r\nMaritime union, they should adjourn to Quebec at an early day, to be\r\nnamed by the governor-general, to consider the question of\r\nconfederation. On the following day the convention adjourned, on the\r\nground that it would be more for the general interest of British North\r\nAmerica to adopt the larger union than a union of the Maritime Provinces\r\nmerely, and it was thought that this might be effected without any very\r\ngreat difficulty, for there was then no strong feeling evinced in any\r\nquarter against confederation.\r\n\r\nFrom Charlottetown the members of the convention and the Canadian\r\ndeputation went to Halifax, where they were received most cordially and\r\nentertained at a banquet. They then took their departure for St. John,\r\nwhere they were entertained at a public dinner at which many leading men\r\nof the city were present. The chair was occupied by the Hon. John H.\r\nGray, one of the delegates, and the expressions in favour of the\r\nproposed confederation were strong and hearty. No one could have\r\nsuspected at that time that the movement for confederation would meet\r\nwith so much opposition in New Brunswick. All seemed plain sailing but,\r\nas the result showed, the battle for confederation had yet to be fought,\r\nand it was won only after a long and doubtful struggle.\r\n\r\n{THE QUEBEC CONFERENCE}\r\n\r\nAccording to arrangement, the delegations from the other provinces met\r\nin convention at Quebec on October 10th, all the colonies, including\r\nNewfoundland, were represented and the delegates were as follows:--\r\n\r\nCanada.--Hon. Sir Etienne P. Taché, premier; Hon. John A. Macdonald,\r\nattorney-general west; Hon. Georges E. Cartier, attorney-general east;\r\nHon. George Brown, president of the executive council; Hon. Alexander T.\r\nGalt, finance minister; Hon. Alexander Campbell, commissioner of Crown\r\nlands; Hon. William McDougall, provincial secretary; Hon. Thomas D'Arcy\r\nMcGee, minister of agriculture; Hon. Hector Langevin, solicitor-general\r\neast; Hon. J. Cockburn, solicitor-general west; Hon. Oliver Mowat,\r\npostmaster-general; Hon. J. C. Chapais, commissioner of public works.\r\n\r\nNova Scotia.--Hon. Charles Tupper, provincial secretary; Hon. W. A.\r\nHenry, attorney-general, Hon. R. B. Dickey, Hon. Adams G. Archibald,\r\nHon. Jonathan McCully.\r\n\r\nNew Brunswick.--Hon. Samuel L. Tilley, provincial secretary; Hon. John\r\nM. Johnson, attorney-general; Hon. Edward B. Chandler, Hon. John\r\nHamilton Gray, Hon. Peter Mitchell, Hon. Chas. Fisher, Hon. William H.\r\nSteeves.\r\n\r\nNewfoundland.--Hon. F. B. T. Carter, speaker of the House of Assembly;\r\nHon. Ambrose Shea.\r\n\r\nPrince Edward Island.--Hon. John Hamilton Gray, premier; Hon. Edward\r\nPalmer, attorney-general; Hon. W. H. Pope, provincial secretary; Hon.\r\nGeorge Coles, Hon. A. A. Macdonald, Hon. T. H. Haviland, Hon. Edward\r\nWhelan.\r\n\r\nSir Etienne P. Taché, who was then premier of Canada, was unanimously\r\nchosen president of the conference, and Major Hewitt Bernard, of the\r\nstaff of the attorney-general west, private and confidential secretary.\r\nIt was arranged that the convention should hold its meetings with closed\r\ndoors, and it was laid down as a principle of the discussion that, as\r\nthe matters to come up for debate were all of a novel character, no man\r\nshould be prejudiced or held liable to the charge of inconsistency\r\nbecause he had changed his views in regard to any particular matter in\r\nthe course of the discussion. It was also agreed that the vote, in case\r\nof a division, should be by provinces and not by numbers, Canada having\r\ntwo votes, representing Canada East and Canada West, and each of the\r\nother provinces one. This arrangement made it quite certain that the\r\ninterests of the Maritime Provinces were not likely to be prejudiced by\r\nthe result of the vote, or the work of the convention. It was soon\r\ndecided that a federal union was to be preferred to a legislative union,\r\nand on the second day of the meeting the outlines of the proposed\r\nconfederation were submitted in a series of resolutions by the Hon. John\r\nA. Macdonald. The general model of the proposed confederation was that\r\nof the United States, but with this difference, that whereas in the\r\nUnited States all powers not expressly given by the constitution to the\r\nfederal government are held to belong to the several states, in the\r\nCanadian constitution all powers not expressly reserved to the several\r\nprovinces were held to belong to the federal parliament. Thus in the\r\nUnited States the residuum of power is in the several states, while in\r\nCanada it is in the federal union and in the parliament of the Dominion.\r\nNo doubt the recent example of the civil war in the United States, which\r\nwas the result of an extreme assertion of state rights, was largely\r\nresponsible for this feature of the Canadian constitution. It is clear,\r\nhowever, that it is a feature that is to be commended, because its\r\ntendency is to cause Canadians to regard themselves rather as Canadians\r\nthan as belonging to any particular province, while in the United States\r\nthe feeling of statehood is still very strong. There are, of course,\r\nmany other contrasts between the Canadian confederation and the federal\r\nunion of the United States, arising from radical differences in the\r\nsystem of government. Nothing like responsible government, as understood\r\nin the British empire, exists in the United States, while this essential\r\nfeature had to be preserved in the Canadian constitution, not only with\r\nreference to the Dominion parliament, but also in the legislatures of\r\nthe several provinces.\r\n\r\n{DIFFICULT QUESTIONS}\r\n\r\nIn all the proceedings at Quebec, Mr. Tilley, as the finance minister of\r\nNew Brunswick, took a very prominent part. One great difficulty which\r\narose was with respect to the amount of money to be given by the federal\r\ngovernment to the several provinces for legislative purposes, in lieu of\r\nthe revenue which they had been accustomed to obtain from customs duties\r\nand otherwise. The whole customs establishment was to be transferred to\r\nthe central government, and as most of the provinces would have no other\r\nmeans of obtaining a revenue except by direct taxation, this feature of\r\nthe matter became of very vital importance. The difficulty was increased\r\nby the fact that by the municipal system prevailing in Upper Canada the\r\nlocal needs of the municipalities, in the way of roads, bridges, schools\r\nand other matters, were provided for by local taxation, whereas in the\r\nMaritime Provinces the provincial government had been accustomed to bear\r\nthese burdens. It was therefore an essential requisite to any scheme of\r\nunion, to make it acceptable to the people of the Maritime Provinces,\r\nthat sufficient money should be given to the provincial governments to\r\nenable them to continue these services as before. It was difficult to\r\nconvince the representatives of Upper Canada of this, and it appears\r\nthat the conference nearly broke up without arriving at any result,\r\nsimply because of the apparently irreconcilable differences of opinion\r\nbetween the representatives of the Maritime Provinces and those of\r\nCanada in regard to this point. Finally these differences were overcome,\r\nand the conclusions of the conference were embodied in a series of\r\nseventy-two resolutions, which were agreed to, and which were to be\r\nauthenticated by the signatures of the delegates, and transmitted to\r\ntheir respective governments, and also to the governor-general, for the\r\nsecretary of state for the colonies. These resolutions formed the first\r\nbasis of confederation and became what is known as the Quebec scheme.\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps inevitable that during the discussion of the scheme of\r\nconfederation by the Quebec convention, the proceedings should be\r\nsecret, but this restriction should have been removed as soon as the\r\nconvention adjourned. That this was not done was the principal reason\r\nfor the very unfavourable reception which the Quebec scheme met with\r\nfrom the people of New Brunswick, when it was placed before them. It was\r\nagreed at the Quebec conference that the scheme should not be made\r\npublic until after the delegates had reported to their respective\r\ngovernments for their approval, but it was impossible that a document,\r\nthe terms of which were known to so many men, should be kept wholly\r\nconcealed from the public, and so the details of the scheme leaked out\r\nand soon became a topic for public discussion. These discussions would\r\nhave been conducted in a much more friendly spirit if the Quebec scheme\r\nhad been given freely to the world, but as it was, prejudices and\r\njealousies, in many cases, darkened the question, and made men, who were\r\notherwise favourable to confederation, assume an attitude of hostility\r\nto the Quebec scheme.\r\n\r\n{SUBVENTIONS TO THE PROVINCES}\r\n\r\nOne of the points which at once attracted the attention of the opponents\r\nof the scheme was the sum allowed to the several provinces for the\r\npurpose of conducting their local affairs. As the provinces had to\r\nsurrender to the general government their right to levy customs and\r\nexcise duties, it became necessary to make up in some way a sum\r\nsufficient to enable them to carry on those services which were still\r\nleft to the provincial legislatures. It was arranged that this sum\r\nshould be eighty cents a head of the population of the provinces as\r\nestablished by the census of 1861, which would give to New Brunswick\r\nsomething more than two hundred thousand dollars. This feature of the\r\nconfederation scheme was eagerly seized upon as being a convenient club\r\nwith which to strike it down. The cry was at once raised that the people\r\nof New Brunswick were asked to sell themselves to Canada for the sum of\r\neighty cents a head, and this parrot-like cry was repeated with\r\nvariations throughout the whole of the election campaign which followed\r\nin New Brunswick. It has often been found that a cry of this kind, which\r\nis absolutely meaningless, is more effective than the most weighty\r\narguments, for the purpose of influencing men's minds, and this proved\r\nto be the case in New Brunswick, when the question of confederation was\r\nplaced before the people. It was conveniently forgotten by those who\r\nattacked the scheme in this fashion that, if the people of New Brunswick\r\nwere selling themselves to Canada for the sum of eighty cents a head,\r\nthe people of Canada were likewise selling themselves to New Brunswick\r\nfor the same sum, because the amount set apart for the provincial\r\nlegislatures was precisely the same in each case. It would not, however,\r\nhave suited the enemies of the confederation scheme to view the matter\r\nin this light; what was wanted was a cry which would be effective for\r\nthe purpose of injuring the scheme and making it distasteful to the\r\npeople who were asked to vote upon it.\r\n\r\n{OPPONENTS OF CONFEDERATION}\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to assume that those who opposed confederation were\r\nall influenced by sinister motives. Many honest and good men, whose\r\nattachment to British institutions could not be questioned, were\r\nopposed to it because their minds were of a conservative turn, and\r\nbecause they looked with distrust upon such a radical change that would\r\nalter the relations which existed between the province and the mother\r\ncountry. Many, for reasons which it is not easy to understand, were\r\ndistrustful of the politicians of Canada, whom they looked upon as of\r\nless sterling honesty than their own, and some actually professed to\r\nbelieve that the Canadians expected to make up their financial deficits\r\nby drawing on the many resources of the Maritime Provinces through the\r\nconfederation scheme. On the other hand confederation was opposed in the\r\nprovince of New Brunswick by a number of men who could only be described\r\nas adventurers, or discredited politicians, and who saw in this contest\r\na convenient way of restoring themselves to influence and power. There\r\nwere also among the opponents of the scheme some men who recognized in\r\nits success the means of perpetuating British power on this continent,\r\nand who, being annexationists, naturally looked with aversion upon it\r\nfor that reason. The vast majority of the people, however, had given the\r\nmatter but the slightest degree of attention, and their votes were cast\r\nin accordance with prejudice hastily formed, which they had an\r\nopportunity of reconsidering before another year and a half had elapsed.\r\n\r\n{FEELING IN NEW BRUNSWICK}\r\n\r\nIt had been arranged at the convention that the first trial of the\r\nscheme before the people should be made in New Brunswick, the\r\nlegislature of which was about expiring, and accordingly the appeal was\r\nmade to the people and the elections came on in the month of March,\r\n1865. The enemies of confederation were very active in every part of the\r\nprovince, and they left no stone unturned to defeat the measure. The\r\ngreat cry upon which they based their opposition to the union with\r\nCanada was that of taxation, and, as the voters of New Brunswick were\r\nnot inclined to favour any policy which involved high taxation, the\r\nappeals made in this way had a powerful effect. All through the rural\r\nconstituencies the Opposition candidates told the electors that if they\r\nunited themselves with Canada direct taxation would be the immediate\r\nresult. They said that every cow, every horse, and every sheep which\r\nthey owned would be taxed, and that even their poultry would not escape\r\nthe grasp of the Canadian tax-gatherers. In the city of St. John, Mr.\r\nTilley and his colleague, Mr. Charles Watters, were opposed by Mr. J. V.\r\nTroop and Mr. A. B. Wetmore. Mr. Troop was a wealthy ship-owner, whose\r\nlarge means made him an acceptable addition to the strength of the\r\nanti-confederate party, although previously he had taken no active part\r\nin political affairs. Mr. Wetmore was a lawyer of standing in St. John,\r\nwho was considered to be one of the best _nisi prius_ advocates at the\r\nbar, and who carried the methods of the bar largely into his politics.\r\nIn the course of time he became attorney-general of the province, and\r\nlater on a judge of the supreme court. Mr. Wetmore, when haranguing St.\r\nJohn audiences, used to depict the dreadful effects of confederation in\r\na manner peculiarly his own. His great plea was an imaginary dialogue\r\nbetween himself and his little son, that precocious infant asking him in\r\nlisping tones, \"Father, what country do we live in?\" to which he would\r\nreply, \"My dear son, you have no country, for Mr. Tilley has sold us to\r\nthe Canadians for eighty cents a head.\"\r\n\r\nIn the county of St. John, the Hon. John. H. Gray, Charles N. Skinner,\r\nW. H. Scovil and James Quinton, who ran as supporters of confederation,\r\nwere opposed by John W. Cudlip, T. W. Anglin, the Hon. R. D. Wilmot and\r\nJoseph Coram. Mr. Cudlip was a merchant, who at one time enjoyed much\r\npopularity in the city of St. John. Mr. Anglin was a clever Irishman, a\r\nnative of the county of Cork, who had lived several years in St. John\r\nand edited a newspaper called the _Freeman_, which enjoyed a great\r\npopularity among his co-religionists. He was admitted to be the leader\r\nof the Irish Catholics of St. John, and had acquired an ascendency over\r\nthem which was not easily shaken; yet he was not, as a politician, a\r\ngreat success, nor did his efforts to improve the condition of his\r\ncountrymen always lead to satisfactory results. The Hon. R. D. Wilmot\r\nhad been a prominent Conservative politician, but was defeated, and had\r\nretired to his farm at Belmont. For some years he had been devoting his\r\nabilities to stock-raising; but at the first note of alarm on the\r\nconfederation question he abandoned his agricultural pursuits and rushed\r\ninto the field to take part in the contest. Mr. Joseph Coram was a\r\nleading Orangeman, and a highly respected citizen.\r\n\r\n{A CRITICAL ELECTION}\r\n\r\nIn the county of York, the Hon. George L. Hatheway, who was then chief\r\ncommissioner of the board of works, appeared in the field as an\r\nOpposition candidate, in company with John C. Allen, John J. Fraser and\r\nWilliam H. Needham. Mr. Hatheway deserted the government in its hour of\r\nneed, apparently because he judged from the cries that were raised\r\nagainst confederation that the current of public opinion was strongly\r\nadverse to the Quebec scheme. Having left Mr. Tilley in the lurch on the\r\neve of the confederation contest, he deserted the Smith government\r\nsixteen months later, when the second confederation election came to be\r\nrun, thereby inflicting upon them a blow from which it was impossible\r\nthey could recover. William H. Needham, whose name has already appeared\r\nin this volume, did not lay claim to any high political principles; but\r\nhaving retired some time before to private life, he found in the\r\nconfederation struggle a good opportunity of getting into the\r\nlegislature. He was a man of very considerable ability, and had his\r\nprinciples been only equal to his knowledge and talents, he might have\r\nrisen to the highest position in the province. But his course on many\r\noccasions made the public distrustful of him, and he died without having\r\nenjoyed any of those honours which men of far less ability have\r\nobtained. John James Fraser, afterwards governor of New Brunswick, was a\r\nman of a different stamp, and seems to have been a sincere opponent of\r\nconfederation from conviction. The same may be said of John C. Allen,\r\nafterwards chief-justice of the province, a man whose sterling honesty\r\nhas never been questioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nDEFEAT OF CONFEDERATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe result of the election was the most overwhelming defeat that ever\r\novertook any political party in the province of New Brunswick. Out of\r\nforty-one members, the friends of confederation succeeded in returning\r\nonly six, the Hon. John McMillan and Alexander C. DesBrisay, for the\r\ncounty of Restigouche; Abner R. McClelan and John Lewis for the county\r\nof Albert; and William Lindsay and Charles Connell for the county of\r\nCarleton. Every member of the government who held a seat in the House of\r\nAssembly, with the exception of the Hon. John McMillan, the\r\nsurveyor-general, was defeated. The majorities against the confederation\r\ncandidates in some of the counties were so large it seemed hopeless to\r\nexpect that any future election would reverse the verdict. Both the city\r\nand county of St. John, and the county of York, made a clean sweep, and\r\nreturned solid delegations of anti-confederates. With the exception of\r\nthe two Carleton members, the entire block of counties on the River St.\r\nJohn and the county of Charlotte, forming the most populous and best\r\nsettled part of the province, declared against the Quebec scheme. On the\r\nnorth shore, Westmorland, Kent, Northumberland and Gloucester\r\npronounced the same verdict, and, on the day after the election, the\r\nstrongest friends of confederation must have felt that nothing but a\r\nmiracle could ever bring about a change in the opinion which had been\r\npronounced with such emphasis and by so overwhelming a majority. Yet\r\nfifteen months later the verdict of March, 1865, was completely\r\nreversed, and the anti-confederates were beaten almost as badly as the\r\nadvocates of confederation had been in the first election; such are the\r\nmutations of public opinion.\r\n\r\nMr. Tilley and his colleagues resigned immediately after the result of\r\nthe elections became known, and the Hon. Albert J. Smith was called upon\r\nto form a new government. Mr. Smith had been attorney-general in Mr.\r\nTilley's government up to the year 1862, when he resigned in consequence\r\nof a difference with his colleagues in regard to the negotiations which\r\nwere being carried on for the construction of the Intercolonial Railway.\r\nHe was a fine speaker, and a man of ability. At a later period, when\r\nconfederation had been established, he became a cabinet minister in the\r\ngovernment of the Hon. Alexander Mackenzie. His powerful influence was\r\nlargely responsible for the manner in which the North Shore counties\r\ndeclared against confederation, and he also did much to discredit the\r\nQuebec scheme by his speeches delivered in the city of St. John. Mr.\r\nSmith did not take the office of attorney-general in the new government,\r\nbut contented himself with the position of president of the council,\r\nthe Hon. John C. Allen, of York, becoming attorney-general, and the Hon.\r\nA. H. Gillmor, of Charlotte, provincial secretary. The Hon. Bliss\r\nBotsford, of Westmorland, was made surveyor-general; and the Hon. George\r\nL. Hatheway retained his old office as the chief commissioner of the\r\nboard of works. The other members of the government were the Hon. Robert\r\nDuncan Wilmot, of Sunbury, the Hon. T. W. Anglin, of St. John, and the\r\nHon. Richard Hutchinson, of Miramichi.\r\n\r\n{THE NEW GOVERNMENT}\r\n\r\nThe new government looked strong and imposing, and seemed to be secure\r\nagainst the assaults of its enemies, yet it was far from being as\r\ncompact and powerful as it appeared to the outward observer. In the\r\nfirst place, it had the demerit of being founded solely on a negative,\r\nand upon opposition to a single line of policy. The reason why these men\r\nwere assembled together in council as a government was that they were\r\nopposed to confederation, and, this question having been disposed of,\r\nthey were free to differ upon all other points which might arise. Some\r\nof the men who thus found themselves sitting together at the same\r\ncouncil board had all their lives been politically opposed to each\r\nother. The Hon. R. D. Wilmot, an old Conservative, could have little or\r\nno sympathy with Mr. A. H. Gillmor, a very strong Liberal. The Hon. A.\r\nJ. Smith, also a Liberal, had little in common with his\r\nattorney-general, Mr. Allen, who was a Conservative. Mr. Odell, the\r\npostmaster-general, represented the old Family Compact more thoroughly\r\nthan any other man who could have been chosen to fill a public office in\r\nNew Brunswick, for his father and grandfather had held the office of\r\nprovincial secretary for the long term of sixty years. As he was a man\r\nof no particular capacity, and had no qualification for high office, and\r\nas he was, moreover, a member of the legislative council, his\r\nappointment to such a position was extremely distasteful to many who\r\nwere strongly opposed to confederation. The Hon. Bliss Botsford, of\r\nMoncton, who became surveyor-general, was another individual who added\r\nno strength to the government. In a cabinet consisting of four men in\r\nthe government who might be classed as Liberals, and five who might be\r\nproperly described as Conservatives, room was left for many differences\r\nand quarrels over points of policy, to say nothing of patronage, after\r\nthe great question of confederation had been disposed of. Local feelings\r\nalso were awakened by the make-up of the government, for the North Shore\r\npeople could not but feel that their interests were in danger of being\r\nneglected, as instead of having the attorney-generalship and the\r\nsurveyor-generalship, which had been theirs in the previous government,\r\nthey had to be content with a single member in the government, without\r\noffice, in the person of Mr. Richard Hutchinson, who, as the\r\nrepresentative of Gilmour, Rankine & Co., the great lumber house of the\r\nNorth Shore, was extremely unpopular, even in the county which had\r\nelected him. The Hon. Robert Duncan Wilmot was perhaps the most\r\ndissatisfied man of any, with the new cabinet in which he found himself.\r\nHe had not been a fortnight in the government before he began to realize\r\nthe fact that his influence in it was quite overshadowed by that of Mr.\r\nSmith and Mr. Anglin, although neither of them held any office. Mr.\r\nWilmot was a man of ability, and of strong and resolute will, so that\r\nthis condition of affairs became very distasteful to him and his\r\nfriends, and led to consequences of a highly important character.\r\n\r\n{DISSENSIONS IN THE GOVERNMENT}\r\n\r\nThe new government had not been long in existence before rumours of\r\ndissensions in its ranks became very common. Mr. Wilmot made no secret\r\nto his friends of his dissatisfaction, and it was understood that other\r\nmembers found their position equally unpleasant. An element of\r\ndifficulty was early introduced by the resignation of the chief-justice,\r\nSir James Carter, who, in September, 1865, found it necessary, in\r\nconsequence of failing health, to retire from the bench, rendering it\r\nimmediately necessary for the government to fill his place. The Hon.\r\nAlbert J. Smith, the leader of the government, had he chosen, might have\r\nthen taken the vacant position, but he did not desire to retire from\r\npolitical life at that time, and the Hon. John C. Allen, his\r\nattorney-general, was appointed to the bench as a puisne judge, while\r\nthe Hon. Robert Parker was made chief-justice. The latter, however, had\r\nbut few weeks to enjoy his new position, dying in November of the same\r\nyear, and leaving another vacancy on the bench to be filled. Again, as\r\nbefore, the Hon. Mr. Smith declined to go on the bench, and the Hon.\r\nJohn W. Weldon, who had been a long time a member of former\r\nlegislatures, and was at one time Speaker, was appointed to the puisne\r\njudgeship, and the Hon. William J. Ritchie was made chief-justice. The\r\nentire fitness of the latter for the position of chief-justice made his\r\nappointment a popular one, but he was the junior of the Hon. Lemuel A.\r\nWilmot as a judge, and the Hon. R. D. Wilmot, who was a cousin of the\r\nlatter, thought the senior judge should have received the appointment of\r\nchief-justice. His disappointment at the office being given to another\r\ncaused a very bad feeling on his part towards the government, and he\r\nwould have resigned his seat forthwith but for the persuasions of some\r\nof those who were not friends of the government, who intimated to him\r\nthat he could do them a great deal more damage by retaining his seat,\r\nand resigning at the proper time than by abandoning the government at\r\nthat moment. Mr. Wilmot remained in the government until January, 1866,\r\nbut although of their number, his heart was estranged from them, and he\r\nmay properly be regarded as an enemy in their camp.\r\n\r\n{CONFEDERATION VICTORY IN YORK}\r\n\r\nMr. Anglin also had some difference with his colleagues with regard to\r\nrailway matters, and he resigned his seat early in November, 1865;\r\nstill he gave a general support to the government, although no longer in\r\nits councils. But the most severe blow which the administration received\r\narose from the election in the county of York, which followed the\r\nseating of the Hon. John C. Allen on the bench. The confederation party\r\nhad been so badly beaten in York at the general election that no doubt\r\nwas felt by the government that any candidate they might select would be\r\nchosen by a very large majority. The candidate selected by the\r\ngovernment to contest York was Mr. John Pickard, a highly respectable\r\ngentleman, who was engaged in lumbering, and who was extremely popular\r\nin that county, in consequence of his friendly relations with all\r\nclasses of the community and the amiability of his disposition. The Hon.\r\nCharles Fisher was brought forward by the confederation party as their\r\ncandidate in York, although the hope of defeating Mr. Pickard seemed to\r\nbe desperate, for at the previous election Mr. Fisher had received only\r\n1,226 votes against 1,799 obtained by Mr. Needham, who stood lowest on\r\nthe poll among the persons elected for York. Mr. Fisher by his efforts\r\nin the York campaign, which resulted in his election, struck a blow at\r\nthe anti-confederate government from which it never recovered. His\r\nelection was the first dawn of light and hope to the friends of\r\nconfederation in New Brunswick, for it showed clearly enough that\r\nwhenever the people of the province were given another opportunity of\r\nexpressing their opinion on the question of confederation, their verdict\r\nwould be a very different one from that which they had given at the\r\ngeneral election. Mr. Fisher beat Mr. Pickard by seven hundred and ten\r\nvotes, receiving seven hundred and one votes more than at the general\r\nelection, while Mr. Pickard's vote fell five hundred and seventy-two\r\nbelow that which Mr. Needham had received on the same occasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTILLEY AGAIN IN POWER\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the causes that had assisted to defeat confederation in New\r\nBrunswick, when the question was first placed before the people, was the\r\nactive hostility of the lieutenant-governor, Mr. Arthur Hamilton Gordon,\r\na son of that Earl of Aberdeen who was prime minister of England at the\r\noutbreak of the Crimean War. Mr. Gordon had been a strong advocate of\r\nmaritime union and had anticipated that he would be the first governor\r\nof the united province of Acadia, or by whatever name the maritime union\r\nwas to be known. He was therefore greatly disappointed and annoyed when\r\nthe visit of the Canadians to Charlottetown, in September, 1864, put an\r\nend to the conference which had met for the purpose of arranging the\r\nterms of a union of that character. While a governor cannot take a very\r\nactive part in political matters, he may stimulate others to hostility\r\nor to a certain course of action, who, under other circumstances, would\r\nbe neutral or inactive, and there is reason to believe that some of the\r\nmen who were most prominent in opposing confederation at the general\r\nelection of 1865 were mainly influenced by the views of the\r\nlieutenant-governor. Confederation, however, had been approved by the\r\nBritish government, after the terms arranged at Quebec had been\r\nsubmitted to it in a despatch from the governor-general; and those\r\nofficials in New Brunswick and elsewhere, who expected to find support\r\nin Downing Street in their hostility to confederation, were destined to\r\nbe greatly disappointed. Not long after the new government was formed in\r\nNew Brunswick, Mr. Gordon returned to England, and it was generally\r\nbelieved that he was sent for by the home authorities. Instead of being\r\nfavourably received on the ground of his opposition to confederation, he\r\nis said to have been compelled to submit to a stern reproof for his\r\nanti-constitutional meddling in a matter which did not concern him, and\r\nto have been given decidedly to understand that if he returned to New\r\nBrunswick, to fill out the remainder of his term of office, it must be\r\nas one pledged to assist in carrying out confederation and not to oppose\r\nit. When Mr. Gordon returned he was an entirely changed man, and\r\nwhatever influence he was able to exert from that time forward was used\r\nin favour of confederation.\r\n\r\n{FENIAN THREATS}\r\n\r\nAnother cause which made confederation more acceptable to the people of\r\nthe province arose from the threats of the Fenians to invade Canada,\r\nwhich were made during the year 1865, and which were followed by armed\r\ninvasions during the following year. Although there was no good reason\r\nfor believing that the opponents of confederation were less loyal than\r\nits supporters or less inclined to favour British connection, it was\r\nremarked that all the enemies of British connection seemed to have got\r\ninto the anti-confederate camp. The Fenian movement had its origin in\r\nthe troubles in Ireland arising out of oppressive land laws and other\r\nlocal causes, and it soon extended to America, where the politicians\r\nfound it useful as a means of increasing their strength among the Irish\r\npeople. At that time, there were in the United States many hundreds of\r\nthousands of men who had been disbanded from the army at the close of\r\nthe Civil War, and who were only too ready to embrace any new\r\nopportunity of winning for themselves fame and rank on other fields of\r\nglory. Among these disbanded soldiers were many Irishmen, and it soon\r\ncame to be known that bands of men could be collected in the United\r\nStates for the invasion of this country, with the avowed object of\r\ndriving the British flag from the American continent and substituting\r\nthe stars and stripes. It was impossible that the people of Canada could\r\nview without emotion these preparations for their undoing, and in New\r\nBrunswick, especially, which was the first province to be threatened,\r\nthe Fenian movement materially assisted in deciding the manner in which\r\nthe people should vote on this great question of confederation when it\r\ncame to be submitted to them a second time.\r\n\r\nThe House of Assembly met on March 8th, 1866, and the speech from the\r\nthrone, delivered by the lieutenant-governor, contained the following\r\nparagraph: \"I have received Her Majesty's commands to communicate to you\r\na correspondence on the affairs of British North America, which has\r\ntaken place between Her Majesty's principal secretary of state for the\r\ncolonies and the governor-general of Canada; and I am further directed\r\nto express to you the strong and deliberate opinion of Her Majesty's\r\ngovernment that it is an object much to be desired that all the British\r\nNorth American colonies should agree to unite in one government. These\r\npapers will immediately be laid before you.\" This paragraph was not\r\ninserted in the speech without considerable pressure on the part of the\r\nlieutenant-governor, and it excited a great deal of comment at the time,\r\nbecause it seemed to endorse the principle of confederation, although\r\nemanating from a government which had been placed in power as the result\r\nof an election in which confederation had been condemned. When this\r\nportion of the speech was read by the lieutenant-governor, in the\r\nlegislative council chamber, the crowd outside the bar gave a hearty\r\ncheer,--a circumstance which never occurred before in the province of\r\nNew Brunswick, and perhaps not in any other British colony.\r\n\r\nThe members of the House favourable to confederation immediately took up\r\nthe matter, and dealt with it as if the government had thereby pledged\r\nthemselves in favour of that policy, and indeed there was a fair excuse\r\nfor such an inference. When the secret history of the negotiations\r\nbetween the lieutenant-governor and his advisers, prior to the meeting\r\nof the legislature, comes to be told, it will be found that at least\r\nsome of the members of the government had given His Excellency to\r\nunderstand that they were prepared to reverse their former action and to\r\nadopt confederation. The difficulty with them was that they feared their\r\nown supporters, and thought that if they made such a move they would\r\nlose the favour of those who had placed them in power, and this fear was\r\ncertainly a very natural one.\r\n\r\n{DESERTED BY FRIENDS}\r\n\r\nAs soon as the House met, it was discovered that Mr. A. R. Wetmore, one\r\nof the prominent supporters of the government who had been elected to\r\nrepresent the city of St. John as an anti-confederate, was no longer in\r\nsympathy with the government. Mr. Wetmore's long experience as a _nisi\r\nprius_ lawyer, and his curt and imperturbable manner, rendered him a\r\nmost exasperating and troublesome opponent, and at a very early period\r\nof the session he commenced to make it unpleasant for his former\r\nfriends. He cross-examined the members of the government in the fashion\r\nwhich he had learned from long experience in the courts. Such attacks\r\nproved extremely damaging as well as very annoying.\r\n\r\nThe address in reply to the speech from the throne was moved in the\r\nHouse of Assembly by Colonel Boyd, of Charlotte County, and when the\r\nparagraph relating to confederation was read, Mr. Fisher asked him what\r\nit meant. Mr. Boyd replied that the government had no objection to\r\nconfederation, provided the terms were satisfactory. This reply still\r\nfurther strengthened the feeling that the government were inclined to\r\npass the measure which they had been elected to oppose. Mr. Fisher moved\r\nan amendment to the fourth paragraph of the address, which referred to\r\nthe Fenian conspiracy against British North America, expressing the\r\nopinion that while His Excellency might rely with confidence on the\r\ncordial support of the people for the protection of the country, his\r\nconstitutional advisers were not by their general conduct entitled to\r\nthe confidence of the legislature. This amendment was seconded by Mr.\r\nDesBrisay, of Kent, who had been elected as a supporter of the\r\ngovernment, and it was debated at great length. The discussion upon it\r\ncontinued from day to day for about three weeks, when, on April 10th,\r\nthe government resigned in consequence of difficulties with His\r\nExcellency in regard to his reply to the address of the legislative\r\ncouncil. The legislative council had proceeded to pass the address in\r\nreply to the speech, but in consequence of the delay in the House of\r\nAssembly, this reply had not before been presented to the governor. In\r\nanswer to the address of the legislative council, His Excellency said:\r\n\"I will immediately transmit your address to the secretary of state for\r\nthe colonies in order that it may be laid at the foot of the throne. Her\r\nMajesty the Queen has already been pleased to express deep interest in a\r\ncloser union of her North America colonies and will no doubt greatly\r\nappreciate this decided expression of your opinion, and the avowal of\r\nyour desire that all British North America should unite in one\r\ncommunity, under one strong and efficient government, which cannot but\r\ntend to hasten the accomplishment of this great measure.\"\r\n\r\n{THE GOVERNMENT RESIGNS}\r\n\r\nThe resignation of the government was announced in the House of Assembly\r\non April 13th by the Hon. A. J. Smith, and the correspondence between\r\nthe lieutenant-governor and his advisers was laid before the House at\r\nthe same time. The immediate and ostensible cause of the resignation was\r\nthe terms of approval in which the lieutenant-governor had replied to\r\nthe address of the legislative council in reference to confederation.\r\nMr. Smith claimed that it was the duty of the lieutenant-governor to\r\nconsult his constitutional advisers in regard to the answer to be given,\r\nand that, in assuming to himself the right to reply to such an address\r\nwithout consulting them, he had not acted in accordance with the true\r\nspirit of the constitution. This was certainly sound doctrine, and the\r\nreply of the lieutenant-governor was by no means satisfactory on this\r\npoint, but he was able to show that Mr. Smith had himself expressed his\r\nwillingness to enter into a scheme of union, although opposed to the\r\nQuebec scheme, and had suggested that, as a preliminary step, the papers\r\non that subject should be referred to a joint committee of both Houses\r\nwith an understanding that the committee should report in favour of a\r\nmeasure of union. At a later period Mr. Smith seemed indisposed to carry\r\nout this arrangement, his conduct evidently being the result of\r\ntimidity, and so he found himself, to use the language of Sir Arthur\r\nGordon, \"entangled in contradictory pledges from which he found it\r\nimpossible to extricate himself.\" He had, in fact, placed himself in the\r\npower of the lieutenant-governor, and his only resource was to resign.\r\nIt was understood at the time, and has never been denied, that His\r\nExcellency was acting under the advice of the Hon. Peter Mitchell, a\r\nmember of the legislative council, who was a strong supporter of\r\nconfederation. Mr. Mitchell was a man of great force of character, and,\r\nnext to Mr. Tilley, must be regarded as the most potent factor in\r\nbringing about the change in the sentiments of the people of the\r\nprovince with respect to confederation.\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant-governor called upon the Hon. Peter Mitchell, who was a\r\nmember of the legislative council, to form a government. Mr. Mitchell\r\nhad been very active in the cause of confederation, and was the moving\r\nspirit in the legislative council in all the proceedings in its favour\r\ntaken in that body; but, when asked to form a new government, he advised\r\nthe lieutenant-governor that the proper person to undertake that\r\nresponsibility was the Hon. Mr. Tilley. The latter, however, declined\r\nthe task on the ground that he was not a member of the legislature,\r\nwhereupon Mr. Mitchell associated with himself the Hon. Mr. Wilmot for\r\nthe purpose of forming a new government. The government was announced on\r\nApril 18th, and was formed as follows:--Hon. Peter Mitchell, president\r\nof the council; Hon. S. L. Tilley, provincial secretary; Hon. Charles\r\nFisher, attorney-general; Hon. Edward Williston, solicitor-general; Hon.\r\nJohn McMillan, postmaster-general; Hon. A. R. McClelan, chief\r\ncommissioner of public works; Hon. R. D. Wilmot and Hon. Charles\r\nConnell, members without office. The latter afterwards became\r\nsurveyor-general.\r\n\r\n{THE FENIAN INVASION}\r\n\r\nWhile the government was being formed in New Brunswick, a Fenian army\r\nwas gathering upon the border for the purpose of invading the province.\r\nThis force consisted of four or five hundred young men, most of whom had\r\nbeen in the army of the United States. It was recruited at New York, and\r\nits chief was a Fenian named Doran Killian. A part of his force arrived\r\nat Eastport on April 10th, and a schooner, laden with arms for the\r\nFenians, soon after reached that place. From this schooner, which was\r\nseized by the United States authorities, one hundred and seventeen cases\r\nof arms and ammunition were taken,--a clear proof that the intentions of\r\nthe Fenians were warlike, and that their presence on the border was not\r\na mere demonstration. The Fenians appeared to have been under the\r\nimpression--as many residents of the United States are to this day--that\r\nthe people of Canada and of New Brunswick were dissatisfied with their\r\nown form of government, and were anxious to come under the protection of\r\nthe stars and stripes. This absurd idea was responsible, largely, for\r\nthe War of 1812, and it has been responsible, since then, for many other\r\nmovements, with respect to the British provinces of North America, in\r\nwhich residents of the United States have taken part. There never was a\r\ngreater delusion than this, and, in the instance referred to, the\r\nFenians were doomed to be speedily undeceived. The presence of a Fenian\r\nforce on the border sounded like a bugle blast to every able-bodied man\r\nin New Brunswick, and the call for troops to defend the country was\r\ninstantly responded to. About one thousand men were called out and\r\nmarched to the frontier. The troops called out consisted of the three\r\nbatteries of the New Brunswick regiment of artillery, seven companies of\r\nthe St. John volunteer battalion, one company of the first battalion of\r\nthe York County militia, one company each of the first and third\r\nbattalions of the Charlotte County militia, and two companies each of\r\nthe second and fourth battalions of the Charlotte County militia. These\r\ntroops remained in arms on the frontier for nearly three months, and\r\nwere disbanded by a general order dated June 20th. The Fenian raid on\r\nNew Brunswick proved to be a complete fiasco. The frontier was so well\r\nguarded by the New Brunswick militia and by British soldiers, and the\r\nSt. Croix so thoroughly patrolled by British warships, that the Fenians\r\nhad no opportunity to make any impression upon the province. It ought to\r\nbe added that the United States government was prompt to take steps to\r\nprevent any armed invasion, and General Meade was sent down to Eastport\r\nwith a force of infantry and a ship of war to prevent the Fenians from\r\nmaking that place a base of operations against these provinces.\r\n\r\n{CONFEDERATION VICTORIES}\r\n\r\nThe general elections to decide whether or not New Brunswick was willing\r\nto become confederated with Canada, were held in May and June. The first\r\nelection was that for the county of Northumberland on May 25th, and the\r\nresult was that the four candidates who favoured confederation, Messrs.\r\nJohnson, Sutton, Kerr and Williston, were elected by large majorities.\r\nThe same result followed in the county of Carleton, where the election\r\nwas held on May 26th, Messrs. Connell and Lindsay being elected by a\r\nvote of more than two to one over their anti-confederate opponents. The\r\nthird election was in Albert County on the 29th, and there Messrs.\r\nMcClelan and Lewis, the two candidates in favour of confederation, were\r\ntriumphantly returned. On May 31st, elections were held in Restigouche\r\nand Sunbury, and, in these counties, the candidates in favour of\r\nconfederation were returned by large majorities. The York election came\r\nnext. In that county, the anti-confederates had placed a full ticket in\r\nthe field, the candidates being Messrs. Hatheway, Fraser, Needham and\r\nBrown. Mr. Fisher had with him on the ticket, Dr. Dow and Messrs.\r\nThompson and John A. Beckwith. Every person expected a vigorous contest\r\nin York, notwithstanding the victory of Mr. Fisher over Mr. Pickard a\r\nfew months before. But, to the amazement of the anti-confederates in\r\nother parts of the province, the Hon. George L. Hatheway and Dr. Brown\r\nretired after nomination day and left Messrs. Fraser and Needham to do\r\nbattle alone. Mr. Hatheway's retirement at this time was a deathblow to\r\nthe hopes of the anti-confederates all over New Brunswick, affecting not\r\nonly the result in the county of York, but in every other county in\r\nwhich an election was to be held. A few nights before his resignation,\r\nMr. Hatheway had been in St. John addressing a packed meeting of\r\nanti-confederates in the hall of the Mechanics' Institute, and he had\r\nspoken on that occasion with apparent confidence. When his friends in\r\nSt. John, who had been so much moved by his vigorous eloquence, learned\r\nthat he had deserted them, their indignation was extreme, and they felt\r\nthat matters must indeed be in a bad way when he did not dare to face\r\nthe York electors.\r\n\r\nThe election in the county of St. John was held on June 6th, and that in\r\nthe city, on the seventh. For the county, the confederate candidates\r\nwere Messrs. C. N. Skinner, John H. Gray, James Quinton and R. D.\r\nWilmot, and the anti-confederate candidates were Messrs. Coram, Cudlip,\r\nRobertson and Anglin. The former were elected by very large majorities,\r\nMr. Wilmot, who stood lowest on the poll among the confederates, having\r\na majority of six hundred over Mr. Coram, who stood highest among the\r\ndefeated candidates. The election for the city was an equally emphatic\r\ndeclaration in favour of confederation. The candidates were the Hon. S.\r\nL. Tilley and A. R. Wetmore on the confederate side, and J. V. Troop and\r\nS. R. Thompson opposed to confederation. Mr. Tilley's majority over Mr.\r\nTroop, who stood highest on the poll of the two defeated candidates, was\r\nseven hundred and twenty-six. The only counties which the\r\nanti-confederate party succeeded in carrying were Westmorland,\r\nGloucester and Kent,--three counties in which the French vote was very\r\nlarge,--so that of the forty-one members returned, only eight were\r\nopponents of confederation. The victory was as complete as that which\r\nhad been recorded against confederation in the beginning of 1865.\r\n\r\n{THE BATTLE IS WON}\r\n\r\nThe battle of confederation had been won, and the triumph was mainly due\r\nto the efforts of the Hon. Mr. Tilley. That gentleman, as soon as the\r\ndefeat of confederation took place in March, 1865, had commenced a\r\ncampaign for the purpose of educating the people on the subject. Being\r\nfree from his official duties and having plenty of time on his hands,\r\nhe was able to devote himself to the work of explaining the advantages\r\nof the proposed union to the people of the province; and during the\r\nyears 1865 and 1866, he spoke in almost every county on the subject\r\nwhich was so near to his heart. He had embraced confederation with a\r\nsincere desire for the benefit of his native province, and with the\r\nbelief that it would be of the greatest advantage to New Brunswick. If\r\nthe fruits of confederation have not yet all been realized, that has\r\nbeen due rather to circumstances over which neither Mr. Tilley nor any\r\none else had any control, than to any inherent vice of confederation\r\nitself. If union is strength, then it must be admitted that the union of\r\nthe British North American provinces, which consolidated them into a\r\npowerful whole, was a good thing; and there cannot be a doubt that if\r\nthe provinces had remained separate from each other, their present\r\nposition would have been much less favourable than it is now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE BRITISH NORTH AMERICA ACT\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the great objects of confederation was the construction of the\r\nIntercolonial Railway from St. John and Halifax to Quebec. It was\r\nthought that there could be no real union between the several colonies\r\nof British North America unless a good means of communication existed,\r\nand such a means was to be obtained only through the construction of\r\nthis line of railway. The Intercolonial Railway, as we have seen, had\r\nbeen a part of the policy of successive governments in the province for\r\nmany years, and it became an essential part of the scheme of\r\nconfederation. When confederation was accepted by the people of New\r\nBrunswick in 1866, the Intercolonial Railway had yet to be built.\r\nWestern Extension, as the line to the Maine border was called, had only\r\nbeen commenced; Eastern Extension, from the Shediac line towards\r\nHalifax, was in the same condition; in fact, the total mileage of the\r\nrailways in New Brunswick did not exceed two hundred miles, and these\r\nlines were isolated and formed no part of any complete system. New\r\nBrunswick now has three separate lines of railway leading to Quebec and\r\nMontreal; it is connected with the great railway systems of the\r\ncontinent; there is no county in the province which has not a line of\r\nrailway traversing it; and the mileage has risen from less than two\r\nhundred to more than fourteen hundred.\r\n\r\nMr. Tilley realized that the time had come when the communities which\r\nform the British provinces of North America must either become\r\npolitically connected or else fall, one by one, beneath the influence of\r\nthe United States. After confederation had been brought about between\r\nCanada, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, enough was seen in the conduct of\r\nAmerican statesmen towards Prince Edward Island to show that their\r\ndesign was to try to create a separate interest in this colony apart\r\nfrom the general interest of Canada. The acceptance of the scheme of\r\nconfederation by Prince Edward Island, at a comparatively early period,\r\nput an end to the plots in that quarter; but in the case of Newfoundland\r\nthe same thing has been repeated, and an attempt was made by American\r\nstatesmen to cause the people of that island to believe that their\r\ninterests and those of Canada are not identical, and that they would be\r\nspecially favoured by the United States if they held aloof from the\r\ngreat Dominion. The attitude of the people and congress of the United\r\nStates towards Canada has not been marked, for the most part, by any\r\ngreat friendliness. They saw in confederation an arrangement that was\r\nlikely to prevent this country from ever becoming absorbed by their\r\nown, and they believed that by creating difficulties for us with respect\r\nto the tariff and other matters, and limiting the area of our commercial\r\nrelations, they could put such pressure upon Canada as would compel our\r\npeople to unite with them. This scheme has failed because it was based\r\non a misconception of the spirit of our people; but who will say that it\r\nwould not have succeeded if the several provinces which now form the\r\nconfederation had been disunited and inharmonious in their relations and\r\nhad pursued different lines of policy?\r\n\r\n{HIS SPEECHES}\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate that, owing to the absence of verbatim reports, it is\r\nimpossible to reproduce any of Tilley's speeches during the\r\nconfederation campaign. No speaker that New Brunswick has ever produced\r\nhas been more generally acceptable than was Tilley. His speeches were\r\npointed, and so clear that they could not be misunderstood. He\r\npossessed, to a very large extent, that magnetism which enabled him to\r\nretain the attention and to awaken the sympathy of his audience. At all\r\nthe meetings which he addressed, there were many who regarded themselves\r\nalways as his friends and supporters and who formed a phalanx around\r\nhim, giving him a confidence and political strength which few statesmen\r\nhave ever enjoyed to a like extent. Although his addresses frequently\r\nprovoked the bitter animosity of his enemies, he had always enough\r\nfriends to counteract their influence; and during the many contests\r\nwhich he had to fight for his seat in the city of St. John, he was\r\nalways able to rely on the loyalty of those who were his early\r\nassociates and who remained his supporters until the end of his career.\r\nIt is quite safe to assert that confederation could not have been\r\ncarried had it not been for the personal efforts of Mr. Tilley. As the\r\nleader of the government which had consented to the Quebec scheme, he\r\nwas properly looked upon as the chief promoter of confederation in New\r\nBrunswick, and his name will go down to future generations identified\r\nwith that large and necessary measure of colonial statesmanship.\r\n\r\n{THE LEGISLATURE MEETS}\r\n\r\nAlthough the vote of the electors had been taken on the question, much\r\nremained to be done before confederation could become an accomplished\r\nfact. The last elections, which were those of Kings and Charlotte, were\r\nheld on June 12th, but more than a year was to elapse before the union\r\nwas effected, and the result which the election was intended to bring\r\nabout realized. The first thing to be done was to call the legislature\r\ntogether and complete the business of the province, which had been\r\ninterrupted by the dissolution. The legislature met on June 21st, and\r\nthe Hon. John H. Gray, who had been an active advocate of confederation,\r\nand who was one of the members for the county of St. John, was made\r\nSpeaker. In the speech from the throne the following reference was made\r\nto the question of confederation:--\r\n\r\n\"Her Majesty's government have already expressed their strong and\r\ndeliberate opinion that the union of the British North American\r\nprovinces under one government is an object much to be desired. The\r\nlegislatures of Canada and Nova Scotia have formed the same judgment,\r\nand you will now shortly be invited to express your concurrence with or\r\ndissent from the view taken of this great question by those provinces.\"\r\n\r\nThe address in reply was moved by Mr. Kerr, of Northumberland, and\r\nseconded by Mr. Beveridge of Victoria, and its consideration was made\r\nthe order of the day for the following Saturday. When it came up for\r\ndiscussion the Hon. Albert J. Smith was not in his place, and Mr.\r\nBotsford, one of his colleagues from Westmorland, endeavoured to have\r\nthe consideration of the matter postponed; but the House was in no\r\nhumour to await the convenience of any single member, and the address\r\nwas passed the same day by a vote of thirty to seven. Attorney-General\r\nFisher, immediately on the passage of the address, gave notice of the\r\nfollowing resolution, which was to be made the order of the day for\r\nMonday, June 26th:--\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That an humble address be presented to His Excellency, the\r\nlieutenant-governor, praying that His Excellency be pleased to appoint\r\ndelegates to unite with delegates from the other provinces in arranging\r\nwith the imperial government for the union of British North America,\r\nupon such terms as will secure the just rights and interests of New\r\nBrunswick, accompanied with provision for the immediate construction of\r\nthe Intercolonial Railway; each province to have an equal voice in such\r\ndelegation, Upper and Lower Canada to be considered as separate\r\nprovinces.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Fisher moved the resolution in question in a very brief speech, and\r\nwas replied to by the Hon. Mr. Smith, who spoke at great length and\r\ncontinued his speech on the following day. Mr. Smith took exception to\r\ngiving the delegates power to fix the destinies of the provinces\r\nforever, without again submitting the scheme of union to the people. He\r\nproceeded to discuss the Quebec scheme, and took exception to the\r\nconstruction of the Upper House of the proposed legislature of the\r\nconfederation, declaring that each province should have an equal number\r\nof representatives in it, as was the case in the United States. After\r\ngoing over the ground pretty thoroughly and criticizing most of the\r\nterms of the scheme of confederation, he moved an amendment, to the\r\neffect that no Act or measure for a union with Canada take effect until\r\napproved by the legislature or the people of the province.\r\n\r\n{A PLAN FOR CONFEDERATION}\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Mr. Tilley replied to the leader of the Opposition in one of\r\nthe most effective speeches that he ever delivered in the legislature.\r\nHe first took up Mr. Smith's allusion to the constitutional question,\r\nand, with immense power and solemnity, he charged that any want of\r\nconstitutional action which existed was due to Mr. Smith and his\r\ncolleagues. He stated that the governor's sympathies were with the late\r\ngovernment, and that he had endeavoured to aid and not to injure them.\r\nMr. Smith had alluded to the Hon. Joseph Howe, who was then an opponent\r\nof confederation, in terms of praise, and Mr. Tilley, in reply, read\r\nfrom Mr. Howe's speech, made in 1861, a magnificent paragraph on the\r\nunion of British America. Mr. Tilley stated that the government would\r\ntake the Quebec scheme for a basis, and would seek concessions to meet\r\nthe views of those who found objection to parts of it. He mentioned the\r\nvarious counties of the province to show that they were either expressly\r\nor potentially favourable to the Quebec scheme. He was convinced that\r\neven his friend, the ex-attorney-general and member for Westmorland, was\r\nhardly against union. He asked, \"Was there one anti-unionist on the\r\nfloor of the House? Where was Mr. Anglin? Mr. Needham? Mr. Hill and all\r\nthe rest of the anti-unionists? They were all swept away and unionists\r\nhad taken their places, and when the arrangements for union were carried\r\nout, the feeling in its favour would be deeper and deeper.\" Mr. Tilley\r\nshowed the great advantages which would accrue to New Brunswick\r\neventually in consequence of confederation. He combated the statement\r\nmade by Mr. Smith that after confederation the provincial legislature\r\nwould become a mere farce, showing that of all the Acts passed during\r\nthe previous two years there were only seven which would have come under\r\nthe control of the general legislature. Mr. Tilley closed by dwelling on\r\nthe impression of power which union would have on the minds of those\r\nabroad who were plotting our ruin. The speech was listened to with the\r\nutmost attention by the members of the legislature and by a very large\r\naudience which completely filled the galleries, and it was generally\r\nconsidered to have been one of his greatest efforts.\r\n\r\n{SMITH'S AMENDMENT}\r\n\r\nThe resolution was finally carried by a vote of thirty to eight, only\r\ntwo members, both of whom would have voted for the resolution, being\r\nabsent. As soon as the confederation resolution was passed the Hon. A.\r\nJ. Smith moved a resolution which, after reciting the steps which had\r\nalready been taken in favour of union with Canada, continued as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n\"THEREFORE, _Resolved_, as the deliberate opinion of this House, that no\r\nmeasure for such union should be adopted which does not contain the\r\nfollowing provisions, viz.: first, an equal number of legislative\r\ncouncillors for each province; second, such legislative councillors to\r\nbe required to reside in the province which they represent and for which\r\nthey are appointed; third, the number of representatives in the federal\r\nparliament to be limited; fourth, the establishment of a court for the\r\ndetermination of questions and disputes that may arise between the\r\nfederal and local governments as to the meaning of the Act of Union;\r\nfifth, exemption of this province from taxation for the construction and\r\nenlargement of canals in Upper Canada, and for the payment of money for\r\nthe mines and minerals and lands of Newfoundland; sixth, eighty cents\r\nper head to be on the population as it increases and not to be confined\r\nto the census of 1861; seventh, securing to each of the Maritime\r\nProvinces the right to have at least one executive councillor in the\r\nfederal government; eighth, the commencing of the Intercolonial Railway\r\nbefore the right shall exist to increase taxation upon the people of the\r\nprovince.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Smith supported his resolution in a lengthy speech in which he\r\npredicted increased taxation as the result of confederation. He said\r\nthat the House, instead of being a deliberative assembly, had to\r\nsurrender its judgment to the government. Confederation was a great\r\nexperiment at best, and called for the exercise of other men's judgment.\r\nThe government were going on in the most highhanded manner and were not\r\njustified in withholding information asked for. He elaborated the idea\r\nthat Canada was pledged to issue treasury notes to pay present\r\nliabilities, and asserted that the government was altogether under the\r\ncontrol of Canadian politicians. He insisted particularly on a provision\r\nin the Act of Union that each of the Maritime Provinces have an\r\nexecutive councillor in the federal government. Finally the vote was\r\ntaken and the following amendment, which had been moved by the Hon. Mr.\r\nFisher, was carried, only eight members voting against it:--\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That the people of this province having, after due\r\ndeliberation, determined that the union of British North America was\r\ndesirable, and the House having agreed to request His Excellency the\r\nlieutenant-governor to appoint delegates for the purpose of considering\r\nthe plan of union upon such terms as will secure the just rights of New\r\nBrunswick, and having confidence that the action of His Excellency under\r\nthe advice of his constitutional advisers will be directed to the\r\nattainment of that end, sound policy and a due regard to the interests\r\nof this province require that the responsibility of such action should\r\nbe left unfettered by an expression of opinion other than what has\r\nalready been given by the people and their representatives.\"\r\n\r\nThis ended the battle for confederation in New Brunswick, for what\r\nremained to be done was merely the arrangement of the details of the\r\nunion by the delegates who had received full powers for that purpose.\r\nThe session of the legislature, which must be considered one of the most\r\nimportant ever held in New Brunswick, came to a close on Monday, July\r\n7th. At a meeting of the government held immediately after the\r\nprorogation, the Hon. Messrs. Tilley, Wilmot, Fisher, Mitchell, Johnson\r\nand Chandler were appointed to go to England as delegates for the\r\npurpose of meeting delegates from Canada and Nova Scotia, and framing\r\nthe bill which was to be passed by the imperial parliament for the\r\nconsummation of confederation. It was understood that there would be no\r\ndelay on the part of the delegates from Canada, but Sir John A.\r\nMacdonald and the other Canadian delegates were unable to leave at the\r\ntime appointed, and did not meet the Maritime Provinces delegation in\r\nEngland until many months after the latter had arrived there. This\r\nunfortunate circumstance produced much comment at the time, because it\r\nlooked as if the government of Canada was treating the delegates of New\r\nBrunswick and Nova Scotia with discourtesy. Instead of the business\r\nbeing completed promptly, as was expected, and the bill passed by the\r\nparliament during the autumn season, the whole matter was thrown over\r\nuntil the following year, and the New Brunswick delegates, most of whom\r\nwere prominent members of the government, had to remain in England for\r\nabout ten months at great expense and inconvenience.\r\n\r\n{THE DELEGATES IN ENGLAND}\r\n\r\nThe delegates from the three provinces, Canada, Nova Scotia and New\r\nBrunswick, met at the Westminster Palace Hotel, London, in December,\r\n1866, the Hon. John A. Macdonald in the chair and Lieut.-Col. Hewitt\r\nBernard acting as secretary. The resolution passed at the Quebec\r\nconference held in 1864 was read, and amendments were moved in\r\naccordance with the suggestions made in the several legislatures during\r\nthe discussions at the previous sessions. It was conceded by all that\r\nthe Intercolonial Railway, by which facilities for interprovincial\r\ncommercial intercourse should be secured, must be built by the united\r\nprovinces and without delay. It was also conceded that in the provinces\r\nwhere separate schools were established by law, that principle should\r\nnot be disturbed. In the discussion it was claimed that the sole right\r\nof imposing an export duty should be vested in the federal authority.\r\nThis was objected to by the New Brunswick delegates, on the ground that\r\nas the people of that province had expended a large sum of money in the\r\nimproving of the navigation of the upper St. John, they had to recoup\r\nthemselves by imposing an export duty on lumber shipped from the\r\nprovince. A considerable portion of the income thus received was paid by\r\nthe lumbermen of the state of Maine, the advantage derived by them from\r\nsuch improvements being very great. The claim thus presented by the New\r\nBrunswick delegates was conceded, and the province was permitted to\r\nretain the right. This right was abandoned after confederation, the\r\nDominion paying therefor a hundred and fifty thousand dollars per annum\r\nto the New Brunswick government.\r\n\r\n{THE BRITISH NORTH AMERICA ACT}\r\n\r\nDuring the sitting of the delegates, which lasted for two months, many\r\nconferences were held with Lord Carnarvon, then secretary of state for\r\nthe colonies, and the law officers of the Crown, in regard to objections\r\nwhich were taken to some of the resolutions adopted by the delegates.\r\nThe governor-general of Canada, Viscount Monck, was in London at the\r\ntime, and was able to render valuable assistance during the conference,\r\nowing to his intimate knowledge of the previous negotiations at Quebec.\r\nThe arrangements there made, in regard to the strengthening of the\r\ncentral government, founded on the experience of the United States\r\nduring the War of Secession, were adhered to in the London resolutions\r\nand accepted by the imperial authorities. When the bill reached\r\nparliament some amendments were suggested, but when it was pointed out\r\nthat the bill as presented was the result of the most careful\r\nconsideration of both the imperial authorities and the colonial\r\nrepresentatives, the suggested amendments were not pressed and the\r\nmeasure passed through both Houses with very little discussion. But one\r\nspirit seemed to animate both the imperial government and the members of\r\nparliament, and that was to give the provinces interested the fullest\r\npowers consistent with their relation to the Empire. The parliamentary\r\nopposition to the measure was much less than might have been expected,\r\nwhen it is remembered that the opponents of confederation had\r\nrepresentatives in London, well able to present objections from their\r\nstandpoint, who had the ear of Mr. Bright and other members of the House\r\nof Commons. Her Majesty took a deep interest in the measure and\r\nexpressed that interest to members of the delegation, adding that she\r\nfelt a great affection for her loyal Canadian subjects. While the bill\r\nwas before the House of Lords, Messrs. Macdonald, Cartier, Galt, Tupper\r\nand Tilley were honoured by a private presentation to Her Majesty, at\r\nBuckingham Palace, and shortly afterwards all the members of the\r\nconference were presented at a drawing-room at the same place.\r\n\r\n{COUNTY COURT ACT}\r\n\r\nThe New Brunswick delegates returned to Canada in the spring of 1867,\r\nhaving completed their labours, and the legislature was called together\r\non May 8th. The business before it was of great importance, for the\r\nprovince was entering upon a new era as a member of the Canadian\r\nconfederation, and the legislature was about to lose that portion of its\r\npowers which was delegated to the federal parliament. It is not,\r\nhowever, necessary to enter into any details of the work of the session,\r\nwhich was carried through without any particular difficulty, the\r\nOpposition being too weak to oppose seriously the measures of the\r\ngovernment. It was felt on all sides that, as twelve members of the\r\nlegislative council were about to become members of the senate of\r\nCanada, and as fifteen representatives were to be elected to the House\r\nof Commons, most of whom would come from the House of Assembly, a\r\nstriking change would take place in the composition of the legislature,\r\nwhich would be deprived of the services of a large number of its ablest\r\nmen. One of the important bills of the session was the passage of the\r\nAct establishing county courts in the province, and in respect to this\r\nmeasure a difference of opinion took place between Mr. John M. Johnson,\r\none of the delegates and member for Northumberland, and his fellow\r\ndelegates to England. He thought that the legislature had no authority\r\nunder the terms of confederation, or from any understanding between the\r\ndelegates while in England, to create county courts, while the other\r\ndelegates held a different view. The Act was passed, however, and has\r\nproved to be one of the most useful ever placed upon the statute-book,\r\nrelieving the supreme court of many cases, both civil and criminal,\r\nwhich would otherwise block its business, and enabling them to be\r\ndisposed of more rapidly than before. The county court judges appointed\r\nunder this Act were, with one exception, taken from the legislature, and\r\nthis made another serious drain upon its experienced members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST PARLIAMENT OF CANADA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe British North America Act, by which the provinces of Upper and Lower\r\nCanada, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia were bound into a confederation,\r\ncame into force by royal proclamation on the first day of July, 1867.\r\nWhen it is considered how vast and vital a change this measure brought\r\nabout, it is surprising that it produced so little excitement anywhere.\r\nWith the exception of one or two demonstrations which were made with\r\nflags by persons hostile to confederation, it was received in the\r\nprovince of New Brunswick, which had been so much excited during two\r\nelections, with perfect calmness, and although for some years afterwards\r\nthere were always a number of persons opposed to union who predicted\r\ndireful things from confederation, and thought it must finally be\r\ndissolved, the voices of such persons were eventually silenced either by\r\ndeath or by their acquiescence in the situation. To-day it may be safely\r\ndeclared that the Canadian confederation stands upon as secure a\r\nfoundation as any other government in the civilized world.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1867, the Hon. John A. Macdonald, the leading spirit in the\r\ngovernment of Canada, was entrusted by Lord Monck, then\r\ngovernor-general, with the formation of a ministry for the Dominion. Mr.\r\nMacdonald naturally experienced a good deal of difficulty in making his\r\narrangements. In the formation of the first ministry much care was\r\nnecessary; provincial and national interests were to be thought of and\r\ndenominational claims had to receive some attention. But the greatest\r\ndifficulty arose with respect to old party lines. Mr. Macdonald thought\r\nthat these ought, as far as possible, to be ignored, and accordingly\r\nselected his men from the leading advocates of confederation belonging\r\nto both parties, placing in his cabinet seven Conservatives and six\r\nLiberals. The Liberals included the names of Mr. W. P. Rowland and Mr.\r\nWilliam MacDougall for Ontario. A large number of the Liberals of\r\nOntario, including George Brown and Alexander Mackenzie, opposed this\r\narrangement, called a public meeting in Toronto, and passed resolutions\r\nin favour of a strictly party government on the old lines. It declared\r\nhostility to the proposal for a coalition, and resolved to oppose\r\nMessrs. Rowland and MacDougall, should they accept office under Mr.\r\nMacdonald. This decision was carried out, but these gentlemen were both\r\nelected by good majorities. In this first ministry there were five\r\nmembers from Ontario, four from Quebec, two from Nova Scotia, and two\r\nfrom New Brunswick: S. L. Tilley and Peter Mitchell.\r\n\r\nThe wisdom of the course adopted will be apparent when it is remembered\r\nthat the question of confederation was not settled or carried on party\r\nlines, some of the Conservatives opposing and some Liberals supporting\r\nit. This was clearly the case in New Brunswick, as shown by the last two\r\nelections held there. About one-third of the Liberal party, and a like\r\nproportion of the Conservative party, opposed confederation at the\r\nsecond election. To have formed the first government on a party basis\r\nwould have necessitated the selection of some men who were opposed to\r\nthe union, and whose efforts might not have been devoted to making it a\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n{FIRST CONFEDERATION MINISTRY}\r\n\r\nThe first confederation ministry was a very strong one. The Hon. John A.\r\nMacdonald became premier and minister of justice; the Hon. George E.\r\nCartier was minister of militia and defence; Alexander T. Galt was\r\nminister of finance; the Hon. William MacDougall was minister of public\r\nworks; the Hon. W. P. Rowland was minister of inland revenue; the Hon.\r\nA. J. F. Blair, president of the privy council; the Hon. Alexander\r\nCampbell, postmaster-general; the Hon. J. C. Chapais, minister of\r\nagriculture; the Hon. Hector L. Langevin, secretary of state. The Hon.\r\nMr. Tilley became minister of customs and the Hon. Mr. Mitchell minister\r\nof marine and fisheries, while the two Nova Scotia representatives,\r\nMessrs. Archibald and Kenny, became respectively secretary of state for\r\nthe provinces and receiver-general.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that the Maritime Provinces had four\r\nrepresentatives out of thirteen members of the cabinet, and this\r\nproportion has generally been maintained since that time; so that the\r\nfears of those who anticipated that the provinces by the sea would not\r\nreceive fair treatment in the distribution of high offices have proved\r\nto be groundless. On the contrary, it can be said that the Maritime\r\nProvince members of the government appear always to have occupied a very\r\ninfluential position.\r\n\r\nThe office of minister of customs, which Mr. Tilley received, was\r\nthought by some of his friends to be less important than he deserved,\r\nthey being of the opinion that he should have been made minister of\r\nfinance. This office, however, went to Mr. Galt, who, owing to a\r\ndifference with the rest of the government, resigned four months later,\r\nhis place in the cabinet being taken by Sir John Rose, who held the\r\noffice of finance minister until October, 1869, Sir Francis Hincks then\r\nreceiving the appointment. It was not until the resignation of the\r\nlatter in February, 1873, that Mr. Tilley became minister of finance.\r\nThe office at first assigned to him, however, was one of great\r\nimportance, involving as it did the reorganization of the entire\r\nestablishment of the customs of Canada, and it gave ample scope for his\r\ngreat ability as a business man.\r\n\r\nThe elections for the House of Commons in the new parliament of Canada\r\ntook place in August, when Tilley was chosen to represent the city of\r\nSt. John, and John H. Gray, the county. It had been expected, in view of\r\nthe fact that these men had been so largely instrumental in bringing\r\nabout confederation, that they would be allowed to walk over the course\r\nunopposed. This was the case with Mr. Gray, whose candidature met with\r\nno opposition; but Mr. Tilley was opposed by Mr. John Wilson, who\r\nreceived a very small vote. This needless and futile opposition to the\r\ncandidature of a man who deserved so well from the province, was merely\r\none of the proofs of the existence of political rancour in the breasts\r\nof those who had been defeated on the confederation question.\r\n\r\n{FIRST CANADIAN PARLIAMENT}\r\n\r\nThe first parliament of united Canada met on November 6th, 1867, and the\r\naddress was moved by the Hon. Charles Fisher, who had been elected to\r\nrepresent the county of York. The session was a very long one, lasting\r\nuntil May 22nd of the following year; but there was an adjournment,\r\nextending from December 21st to March 20th. This meeting of parliament\r\nwas especially memorable, inasmuch as it brought together, for the first\r\ntime, the representatives of all the provinces, and the ablest men of\r\nall political parties. The people of Ontario and Quebec were little\r\nknown to the people of the Maritime Provinces, and those who resided in\r\nthe larger provinces in like manner knew comparatively little of their\r\nfellow-subjects who dwelt by the sea. It was expected by some that the\r\nMaritime Province representatives would be completely overshadowed by\r\nmen of greater political reputation belonging to the larger provinces,\r\nbut this did not prove to be the case. The Maritime representatives at\r\nonce took a leading position in parliament, and this position they have\r\nsteadily maintained down to the present time. No man stood better in the\r\nHouse of Commons than the representative from St. John, the Hon. S. L.\r\nTilley. At that time Her Majesty, the Queen, in acknowledgment of his\r\nservices in the cause of confederation, had created him a Companion of\r\nthe Bath, a distinction which was also given to the Hon. Charles Tupper,\r\nof Nova Scotia.\r\n\r\nA vast amount of business had to be disposed of at the first session of\r\nthe parliament of Canada. Although the Union Act embodied the plan upon\r\nwhich confederation was founded, it was necessary to supplement it by a\r\ngreat deal of special legislation, for the purpose of interpreting it\r\nand making preparations for the practical working of the constitution.\r\nIn all the discussions relative to the measures which had to be passed\r\nat that time, Tilley took a prominent part, and, when the session was\r\nover, he had established in the House of Commons, as fully as he had in\r\nthe legislature of New Brunswick, a reputation for ability as a speaker\r\nand as a man of affairs. He was looked upon as one whose wide knowledge\r\nof the needs of the province and whose experience in departmental work\r\nwere likely to be of the greatest use to the confederation. His high\r\ncharacter gave weight at all times to his words, and caused him to be\r\nlistened to with the most respectful attention. During the whole period\r\nthat Tilley sat in the House of Commons, he had the pleasure of knowing\r\nthat even his political enemies respected his character and abilities,\r\nand, with the exception of the premier, perhaps no man wielded a more\r\npotent influence in the councils of the Dominion than he.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary here to trace to any large extent the career of Sir\r\nS. L. Tilley in the parliament of Canada; that belongs rather to the\r\nhistory of the Dominion than to a work which deals particularly with his\r\nconnection with his native province. Only so much of his public life in\r\nthe House of Commons will be dealt with as seems necessary to complete\r\nhis personal history. Tilley continued to hold the position of minister\r\nof customs during the whole of the term of the first parliament of\r\nCanada. This parliament held five sessions and dissolved in the summer\r\nof 1872, the general election being in the month of July, upon which\r\noccasion he was reëlected for the city of St. John without opposition.\r\n\r\n{MINISTER OF FINANCE}\r\n\r\nThe second parliament met on March 5th, 1873. Eleven days before that\r\ntime Mr. Tilley had become minister of finance, succeeding Sir Francis\r\nHincks, who had resigned that office after holding it for more than\r\nthree years. The advancement of Mr. Tilley to this responsible and\r\ninfluential position was very pleasing to his friends, and was received\r\nwith satisfaction by the country generally.\r\n\r\nThe first confederation ministry of Canada resigned office on November\r\n5th, 1873, under circumstances which are a part of the political history\r\nof the Dominion and need not be gone into in this volume, further than\r\nto say that, whatever basis there may have been for charges of\r\ncorruption in connection with the Pacific Railway contract against other\r\npersons in the government, none were ever preferred against Mr. Tilley;\r\nnor did any one suspect or believe that he had anything whatever to do\r\nwith the transactions which led to the resignation of the government.\r\nPrior to that event Mr. Tilley had been appointed lieutenant-governor of\r\nthe province of New Brunswick in succession to the Hon. Lemuel A.\r\nWilmot, whose term had expired. Every one felt that the honour thus\r\nbestowed upon Tilley was a most fitting one, for he was New Brunswick's\r\nforemost son in political life, and had reached his high position purely\r\nthrough his own ability and his own good character. That position he\r\nfilled a greater number of years than any of his successors are likely\r\nto do, and it is admitted on all sides that no man could have performed\r\nthe duties of the office more satisfactorily than he did.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nFINANCE MINISTER AND GOVERNOR\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Tilley took up his residence in the old Government House,\r\nFredericton, and he must have been struck with the changed aspect\r\nof affairs from that presented under the old régime, when\r\nlieutenant-governors were appointed by the British government and sent\r\nout from England to preside over the councils of a people of whom they\r\nknew little or nothing. Most of these former governors had been military\r\nmen, more accustomed to habits of command than to deal with perplexing\r\nquestions of state. They looked with a very natural degree of impatience\r\non the attempts which the people of the province were making to get the\r\nfull control of their own affairs. Under the old régime the governor was\r\nsurrounded with military guards, and sentries paced the walks and\r\nguarded the entrances to the Government House. The withdrawal of the\r\nBritish troops from Canada before the lieutenant-governorship of Mr.\r\nTilley commenced relieved him of any embarrassment in regard to\r\ndispensing with military guards and sentries; but all pretentious\r\naccompaniments of authority were foreign to his nature, and he always\r\nshowed, by the severe simplicity of his life, that he felt he was one\r\nof the people, and that it was his duty as well as his pleasure to\r\npermit all who had any occasion to see him to have free access to him,\r\nwithout the necessity of going through any formal process.\r\n\r\n{THE PROTECTIONIST TARIFF}\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Tilley became lieutenant-governor of the province, he was\r\nfifty-five years of age, and he seems to have thought that his political\r\ncareer was ended, because, by the time his term of office expired in its\r\nnatural course, he would have reached the age of sixty, a period when a\r\nman is not likely to make a new entrance into public life. But\r\ncircumstances, quite apart from any desire on his part, made it almost\r\nnecessary for him to change his determination, and during the summer of\r\n1878, when the general election was imminent, he found himself pressed\r\nby his old political friends to become once more the candidate of his\r\nparty for his old constituency, the city of St. John. There was great\r\nenthusiasm amongst them when it was announced that he would comply with\r\ntheir wishes, and that he had resigned the lieutenant-governorship. The\r\nresult of that general election is well known. The Liberal party, which\r\nhad succeeded to the government less than five years before with a large\r\nmajority in the House of Commons, experienced a severe defeat, and the\r\nHon. Alexander Mackenzie, seeing this, very properly did not await the\r\nassembling of parliament, but sent in the resignation of the ministry,\r\nand Sir John A. Macdonald was called upon to form a new government. In\r\nthe cabinet thus constructed Mr. Tilley resumed his old office of\r\nminister of finance, and one of his first duties was to assist in the\r\nframing of a new customs tariff which was to give effect to the\r\nprinciple, upon which the election had been run, of protection to home\r\nindustries. This idea of protection had not been heard of in the\r\nCanadian confederation as the policy of any political party until Sir\r\nJohn A. Macdonald took it up about a year before the general election,\r\nbut it proved a winning card and was the means of giving the new\r\ngovernment a long lease of power.\r\n\r\nSir Leonard Tilley's speech in introducing the new tariff was well\r\nreceived and made a strong impression upon all who heard it. It was\r\nadmitted, even by those who were opposed to the views he held, that he\r\nshowed a great mastery of the details, and that he illustrated in a very\r\nclear manner the view that the country was suffering because the duties\r\nimposed upon foreign goods were not sufficiently high to protect\r\nCanadian manufactures.\r\n\r\nIt is not the intention of this volume to deal to any full extent with\r\nthe career of Sir Leonard Tilley during his second term of office as\r\nminister of finance of Canada. To enter into that phase of his career\r\nwould be to relate the history of Canada, for he was but one member of\r\nthe government, and not its leader. It is admitted that, in respect to\r\nfinancial questions, Sir Leonard showed the same ability that had\r\ncharacterized his career during his previous term of office, and he was\r\nlooked upon by his colleagues as a man in whose judgment the utmost\r\nconfidence could be placed. At this time, however, his health began to\r\nfail, and the disease which finally carried him off developed to such an\r\nextent that he was told he must cease all active work or his days would\r\nbe shortened. Under these circumstances, it became necessary for him to\r\nretire from the severe duties of his very responsible and laborious\r\noffice, and on October 31st, 1885, he was again appointed\r\nlieutenant-governor of New Brunswick, an office which he had filled with\r\nso much acceptance between 1873 and 1878. Sir Leonard Tilley continued\r\nlieutenant-governor during a second term, for almost eight years, or\r\nuntil the appointment of the Hon. John Boyd to that position. He was\r\nlieutenant-governor of New Brunswick for considerably more than twelve\r\nyears, a record which is not likely to be equalled by any future\r\nlieutenant-governor for many years to come, if ever.\r\n\r\n{SECOND TERM AS GOVERNOR}\r\n\r\nThere was no event of particular importance to distinguish Sir Leonard\r\nTilley's second term as lieutenant-governor. The Hon. Mr. Blair was\r\npremier of New Brunswick during the whole period, and there was no\r\npolitical crisis of any importance to alter the complexion of affairs.\r\nThe only event in connection with the governorship which is worthy of\r\nbeing mentioned is the change that was made by the abandonment of the\r\nold Government House, at Fredericton, as the residence of the\r\nlieutenant-governor. This building had become antiquated, and in other\r\nways unsuitable for the occupancy of a lieutenant-governor, and its\r\nmaintenance involved a very large expenditure annually, which the\r\nprovince was unable to afford. It was therefore determined that in\r\nfuture the lieutenant-governor should provide his own residence, and\r\nthat the amount spent on the Government House annually should be saved.\r\nSir Leonard Tilley built a residence in St. John, in which he lived for\r\nthe remainder of his life, and the seat of government, so far as his\r\npresence was concerned, was transferred to that city. Sir Leonard Tilley\r\nwas always on the most cordial terms with the various premiers who led\r\nthe government of New Brunswick during their terms of office. He knew\r\nwell the strict constitutional limits of his office, and was always\r\ncareful to confine his activities within their proper scope. The lessons\r\nof responsible government which he had learned in his early youth, and\r\nwhich had been the study of his manhood, enabled him to avoid those\r\npitfalls which beset the steps of earlier lieutenant-governors.\r\n\r\nDuring Sir Leonard Tilley's last term of office, and after its close, he\r\nabstained wholly from any interference with public affairs in the\r\nDominion, and although he still remained steadfastly attached to the\r\nLiberal-Conservative party, he gave no outward sign of his desire for\r\ntheir success. This neutral position which he assumed in political\r\nmatters had the effect of drawing towards him thousands of his\r\nfellow-countrymen who, in former years, had been accustomed to regard\r\nhim with unfriendly feelings. They forgot the active political leader\r\nand saw before them only the aged governor, whose venerable figure and\r\nkindly face were so familiar at social or other gatherings, or whenever\r\nwork was to be done for any good cause. In this way Sir Leonard Tilley\r\ngrew to assume a new character in the public estimation, and at the time\r\nof his death the regret was as great on the part of those who had been\r\nhis political opponents as among those who had been his associates in\r\npolitical warfare. This was one of the most pleasing features of his\r\ndeclining years, and one that gave him the greatest satisfaction,\r\nbecause it enabled him to feel that he enjoyed the affectionate regard\r\nof the whole body of the people.\r\n\r\nSir Leonard Tilley throughout his life gave great attention to his\r\nreligious duties. He was a devoted member of the Church of England, and\r\nhis attendance at its services was constant and regular. For several\r\nyears before his death he was connected with St. Mark's congregation,\r\nand no cause, except severe bodily illness, was ever allowed to prevent\r\nhim from going to church on Sunday morning. On many occasions, when his\r\nsteps had grown feeble and his strength was failing, it was suggested to\r\nhim that he should drive to church, but he always replied that he would\r\nwalk to church as long as he had strength left to do so, and that he\r\nwould not have people harnessing up horses on the Sabbath Day on his\r\naccount. This resolution he maintained to the end of his life.\r\nSometimes, when he met an old acquaintance, as he toiled up the street\r\nwhich led to his favourite church, he would cheerfully greet him by\r\nsaying, \"John, this hill has grown steeper than it used to be,\" but he\r\nclimbed the hill to the end, and the last Sunday he was able to be out\r\nof his bed he walked to church as usual. He also took a deep interest in\r\nall humane and philanthropic objects as well as in the great work\r\nconnected with the spread of the Gospel. He was a constant attendant at\r\nthe annual meetings of the British and Foreign Bible Society, and was a\r\nlife member of that admirable association.\r\n\r\n{HIS IMPERIAL HONOURS}\r\n\r\nThe honours that Sir Leonard Tilley received from Her Majesty, in\r\nrecognition of his great public services, were very gratifying to his\r\nfriends as well as to himself, and when he was made a Knight Commander\r\nof St. Michael and St. George, in 1879, his temperance friends embraced\r\nthe first opportunity on his return to St. John to have a banquet in his\r\nhonour, at which he wore, for the first time in public, the insignia of\r\nthe knightly order of which he had become a member. There was probably\r\nno public event in the whole course of his life which gave him greater\r\npleasure than this proof of the attachment of his old friends.\r\n\r\nSir Leonard's last visit to England was marked by an extremely gracious\r\ninvitation to visit the queen at Osborne, in the Isle of Wight. While he\r\nand Lady Tilley were sojourning at Cowes a message was sent summoning\r\nthem to Osborne House, where they were received by Her Majesty in the\r\nbeautiful grounds that surround that palace. The Princess Louise and\r\nPrincess Beatrice, with an equerry in waiting, were the only other\r\npersons present. After an interesting conversation they were permitted\r\nto visit the private apartments of Her Majesty, and the Prince Consort's\r\nfarm.\r\n\r\nSir Leonard Tilley was first married in 1843 to Julia Ann, daughter of\r\nthe late James T. Hanford, who died in 1862. By her he had seven\r\nchildren, two sons and five daughters. In 1867, he married Alice Starr,\r\ndaughter of the late Z. Chipman, of St. Stephen. By this marriage he had\r\ntwo sons, Mr. Herbert C. Tilley, of the Imperial Trust Company, who\r\nresides in St. John, and Mr. L. P. DeWolfe Tilley, barrister, who is\r\nalso a resident of St. John. These two sons, Herbert and Leonard, were\r\nthe prop and comfort of his declining years and were devoted wholly to\r\nhim to the end.\r\n\r\n{LADY TILLEY}\r\n\r\nSir Leonard Tilley's second marriage was contracted at the time when he\r\nwas exchanging the limited field of provincial politics for the wider\r\nsphere which confederation opened up to him in the parliament of Canada.\r\nIt was a fortunate union, for it gave him a helpmeet and companion who\r\nwas in full sympathy with him in all his hopes and feelings, and who was\r\nsingularly well qualified to preside over his household, which, in his\r\ncapacity of a minister of the Crown, had become, to a considerable\r\nextent, a factor in the public life of Canada. Lady Tilley had a high\r\nideal of her duty as the wife of a cabinet minister and of the governor\r\nof New Brunswick, and was not content to lead a merely ornamental life\r\nor confine her energies within a narrow range. She saw many deficiencies\r\nin our appliances for relieving human misery, and with a zeal which\r\ncould not be dampened, she sought to remedy them. The Victoria Hospital\r\nat Fredericton is her work; hers also is the Nurses' Home in connection\r\nwith the Public Hospital in St. John, and the Reformatory for the care\r\nof bad or neglected boys, who are in danger of becoming criminals if\r\nthey are not educated and disciplined when they are young. In every work\r\nof philanthropy Lady Tilley has always taken not only an active, but a\r\nleading part, and her position has enabled her to enlist in the cause of\r\nhumanity the energies of many who, under other circumstances, might not\r\nhave given their attention to philanthropic work.\r\n\r\nSir Leonard Tilley for many years had suffered from an incurable\r\ndisease, which had been mitigated by rest and medical treatment, but not\r\nremoved. It was the knowledge of the fact that his days would be\r\nshortened if he continued in active political life that compelled him\r\nto leave the government in 1885. For many years before his death the\r\nmalady had been so far subdued that it gave him comparatively little\r\ntrouble, but any unusual exertion on his part was almost certain to\r\narouse it again to activity, so that he was prevented on many occasions\r\nfrom taking part in public functions which, under other circumstances,\r\nhe would have been glad to attend. Still, he always contrived to take\r\nhis daily walk, and few who saw him ever suspected that he was\r\nconstantly menaced by death. For three or four years before his decease\r\nhis strength had been failing, he stooped more as he walked, and it was\r\nevident that he was not destined to enjoy many more years of life. Yet\r\nduring the spring of 1896 there was nothing whatever to indicate that\r\nthe end was so near, for he went about as usual, and was able to preside\r\nat the annual meeting of the Loyalist Society which was held during the\r\nlast week in May. On that evening he appeared very bright and cheerful,\r\nand he entered with much interest into the discussion of the details of\r\nan outing which it was proposed the society should hold during the\r\nsummer. \"Man proposes, God disposes.\" Sir Leonard had gone to Rothesay\r\nearly in June to spend a few weeks in that pleasant spot, and he\r\nappeared to be in his usual health until the night of June 10th, when he\r\nbegan to suffer great pain from a slight cut which he had received in\r\nthe foot. The symptoms became alarming and gave indications of blood\r\npoisoning, a condition due to the disease from which he had suffered so\r\nmany years. On June 11th, he was taken to Carleton House, his town\r\nresidence, and from that time the doctors gave no hope of his recovery.\r\nIt was one of the sad features of his illness that his life-long friend\r\nand physician for many years, Dr. William Bayard, was unable to attend\r\nhim, being himself confined to his bed by illness.\r\n\r\n{LAST ILLNESS AND DEATH}\r\n\r\nAfter Sir Leonard Tilley reached his home in St. John he never rallied,\r\nand he was well aware that his end was near. He was attended by Dr.\r\nInches and Dr. Murray McLaren, but he was beyond medical aid, and\r\ntherefore the people of St. John, for several days before the event took\r\nplace, were aware that their foremost citizen was dying. The time was\r\none of great excitement, for the general election was near, yet the eyes\r\nof thousands were turned from the moving panorama of active life which\r\npassed before them to the silent chamber where the dying statesman was\r\nbreathing his last. The regret and sympathy that was expressed was\r\nuniversal, and in their kindly words those who had been his life-long\r\npolitical opponents were not behind those who had been his friends. Sir\r\nLeonard Tilley died at three o'clock on the morning of June 25th, the\r\nsecond day after the general election which brought about the defeat of\r\nthe party with which he had been so long identified.\r\n\r\n{HIS EMINENT SERVICES}\r\n\r\nHis death evoked expressions of sympathy and regret from all parts of\r\nthe empire and from many states of the union. The letters and telegrams\r\nof condolence which Lady Tilley received during the first days of her\r\nwidowhood would of themselves fill a volume, showing how widely he was\r\nknown and respected. The funeral, which took place on the Saturday\r\nfollowing his death, was one of the largest ever seen in St. John, and\r\nwas attended by the Board of Trade, the Loyalist Society, the various\r\ntemperance organizations, the members of the provincial government, and\r\na vast concourse of prominent citizens. The services took place at St.\r\nJohn's Episcopal Church, and were conducted by the rector, the Rev. John\r\ndeSoyres, assisted by the Rev. R. P. McKim, rector of St. Luke's Church,\r\nwith which Sir Leonard had been identified in his earlier years. The\r\ninterment took place in the Rural Cemetery. Many references to the\r\ndecease of this eminent man were made from the pulpits of St. John and\r\nother parts of the province on the Sunday following his death, and all\r\nthe newspapers had long notices of the event and editorials on his life\r\nand character. We may fittingly close this work by quoting a portion of\r\nwhat was said of him by the St. John _Telegraph_, a paper that was\r\npolitically opposed to him for many years:--\r\n\r\n\"It is greatly to the honour of Sir Leonard Tilley that no scandal,\r\npublic or private, was ever attached to his name. A consistent\r\ntemperance man to the end of his life, he was faithful to the cause\r\nwhich he had espoused when he was young, and he enjoyed the confidence\r\nand received the steady support of a vast majority of the temperance men\r\nof the province, who looked upon him as their natural leader. His\r\ncapacity for friendship was great, and his friends might be numbered by\r\nthousands, for he had a peculiar faculty of strongly attracting men to\r\nhimself. This may be ascribed, in part, to the magnetism of a buoyant\r\nand strong nature, but it was more largely due to the extreme simplicity\r\nof his character, which remained wholly unspoiled by the favours which\r\nfortune had showered upon him. No man, however humble, had any\r\ndifficulty in obtaining an interview with Sir Leonard Tilley; he was\r\nevery inch a gentleman, and was, therefore, as polite to the poorest\r\nlabourer as to the richest in the land. Such a man could not fail to be\r\nloved even by those who had been his most bitter opponents in former\r\nyears, when he was in active political life.\r\n\r\n\"It is one of the drawbacks of this human life that the wise, the\r\nlearned, the good, and those whom we most love and honour, grow old and\r\nfeeble, fall by the wayside and pass away. So while we lament the death\r\nof Sir Leonard Tilley, we must recognize it as an event that was\r\ninevitable, and which could not long have been postponed. His lifework\r\nwas done; his labours were ended; his active and brilliant career was\r\nclosed; he was but waiting for the dread summons which sooner or later\r\nmust come to all. The summons has come, and he has gone from among us\r\nforever. His venerable, noble face will no longer be seen on our\r\nstreets, his kindly greeting will no longer be heard. But his memory\r\nwill live, not only in the hearts of all his countrymen, but enshrined\r\nin the history of this his native province, and of the great Dominion\r\nwhich he did so much to create, and which he so fondly loved.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nA\r\n\r\n Allen, Hon.
