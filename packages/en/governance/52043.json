W. G. WILLIAMS, A.M.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of Julius Cæsar to the fall of the Roman Empire, a period\r\nof more than four hundred years, the greater part of the Germans were\r\nsubject to Roman rule, a rule maintained only by military force. But\r\nthe struggle against Rome never entirely ceased—and as Roman power\r\ngradually declined the Germans seized every opportunity to recover\r\ntheir liberty and in their turn became conquerors. To trace the\r\nsuccession of their vicissitudes during this period would be to give\r\nthe narrative of a bold, vigorous, war-like people in their rude\r\nbarbaric condition. We should discover even in those early times those\r\nrace characteristics of strength, bravery and persistence which became\r\nso marked in later centuries; we should recognize in Hermann, the first\r\nGerman leader, the prophecy of the Great Charles who steps upon the\r\nscene nearly eight centuries later.\r\n\r\n\r\nHERMANN, THE FIRST LEADER.\r\n\r\nHe it was (Hermann Arminius) who, with a power to organize equal\r\nto that of William of Orange, bound the German tribes in a secret\r\nconfederacy, whose object it was to resist and repel the Roman armies.\r\nWhile still himself serving as an officer in the Roman army, he managed\r\nto rally the confederated Germans and to attack Varus’s army of forty\r\nthousand men—the best Roman legions—as they were marching through the\r\nTeutoburger Forest, where, aided by violent storms, the Germans threw\r\nthe Romans into panic and the fight was changed to a slaughter. When\r\nthe news of the great German victory reached Rome the aged Augustus\r\ntrembled with fear; he let his hair and beard grow for months as a sign\r\nof trouble, and was often heard to exclaim: “O, Varus, Varus, give me\r\nback my legions.” Though Rome, under the able leadership of Germanicus,\r\nsoon after defeated the Germans, yet she had been taught that the\r\nGermans possessed a spirit and a power sufficient to make her tremble\r\nfor her future supremacy.\r\n\r\nHermann seems to have devoted himself to the creation of a permanent\r\nunion of the tribes he had commanded. We may guess, but can not assert,\r\nthat his object was to establish a national organization like that of\r\nRome, and in doing this he must have come into conflict with laws and\r\ncustoms which were considered sacred by the people. But his remaining\r\ndays were too few for even the beginning of a task which included such\r\nan advance in the civilization of the race. We only know that he was\r\nwaylaid and assassinated by members of his own family in the year 21.\r\nHe was then 37 years old and had been for thirteen years the leader of\r\nhis people.[A]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe was undoubtedly the liberator of Germany, having dared to grapple\r\nwith the Roman power, not in its beginnings, like other kings and\r\ncommanders, but in the maturity of its strength. He was not always\r\nvictorious in battle, but in war he was never subdued. He still lives\r\nin the songs of the barbarians, unknown to the annals of the Greeks,\r\nwho only admire that which belongs to themselves—nor celebrated as he\r\ndeserves by the Romans, who, in praising the olden times, neglect the\r\nevents of the later years.[B]\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMAN NATIONALITIES AT THE CLOSE OF THE THIRD CENTURY.\r\n\r\nWhen we meet the Germans at the close of the third century we are\r\nsurprised to find that the tribal names which they bore in the time\r\nof Hermann have nearly all disappeared, and new names of wider\r\nsignificance have taken their places. Instead of thirty to forty petty\r\ntribes, they are now consolidated into four chief nationalities with\r\ntwo or three inferior, but independent branches. Their geographical\r\nsituation is no longer the same, migrations have taken place, large\r\ntracts of territory have changed hands, and many leading families have\r\nbeen overthrown and new ones arisen. Nothing but the constant clash of\r\narms could have wrought such change. As each of these new nationalities\r\nplays a prominent part in the following centuries, a short description\r\nof them is given:\r\n\r\n1. _The Alemanni._—The name of this division (_Alle Mannen_, signifying\r\n“all men”) shows that it was composed of fragments of many tribes. The\r\nAlemanni first made their appearance along the Main, and gradually\r\npushed southward over the Tithe lands, where the military veterans of\r\nRome had settled, until they occupied the greater part of southwestern\r\nGermany, and eastern Switzerland to the Alps. Their descendants occupy\r\nthe same territory to this day.\r\n\r\n2. _The Franks._—It is not known whence this name is derived, nor what\r\nis its meaning. The Franks are believed to have been formed out of\r\nthe Sicambrians in Westphalia, a portion of the Chatti and the Batavi\r\nin Holland, together with other tribes. We first hear of them on the\r\nLower Rhine, but they soon extended their territory over a great part\r\nof Belgium and Westphalia. Their chiefs were already called kings, and\r\ntheir authority was hereditary.\r\n\r\n3. _The Saxons._—This was one of the small original tribes settled in\r\nHolstein. The name “Saxon” is derived from their peculiar weapon, a\r\nshort sword, called _sahs_. We find them occupying at the close of the\r\nthird century nearly all the territory between the Harz Mountains and\r\nthe North Sea, from the Elbe westward to the Rhine. There appears to\r\nhave been a natural enmity—no doubt bequeathed from the earlier tribes\r\nout of which both grew—between them and the Franks.\r\n\r\n4. _The Goths._—Their traditions state that they were settled in Sweden\r\nbefore they were found by the Greek navigators on the southern shore of\r\nthe Baltic in 330 B. C. It is probable that only a portion of the tribe\r\nnavigated, and that the present Scandinavian race is descended from the\r\nremainder. They came in contact with the Romans beyond the mouth of the\r\nDanube about the beginning of the third century.[C]\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF THE ROMANS ON THE GERMANS.\r\n\r\nThe proximity of the Romans on the Rhine, the Danube, and the Neckar,\r\nhad by degrees effected alterations in the manners of the Germans. They\r\nhad become acquainted with many new things, both good and bad. By means\r\nof the former they became acquainted with money, and even luxuries.\r\nThe Romans had planted the vine on the Rhine, and constructed roads,\r\ncities, manufactories, theaters, fortresses, temples, and altars. Roman\r\nmerchants brought their wares to Germany, and fetched thence amber,\r\nfeathers, furs, slaves, and the very hair of the Germans; for it became\r\nthe fashion to wear light flaxen wigs, instead of natural hair. Of\r\nthe cities which the Romans built there are many yet remaining, as\r\nSalzburg, Ratisbonne, Augsburg, Basle, Strasburg, Baden, Spires, Worms,\r\nMetz, Treves, Cologne, Bonn, etc. But in the interior of Germany,\r\nneither the Romans nor their habits and manners had found friends, nor\r\nwere cities built there according to the Roman style.[D]\r\n\r\n\r\nINVASION OF THE HUNS—ATTILA.\r\n\r\nThe fourth century of our era and the first half of the fifth were\r\ncharacterized by the spirit of migration among all the peoples beyond\r\nthe Rhine. Representatives of every German village and district went\r\nto Rome, and each brought back stories of the wealth and luxury\r\nthat existed there. They had the keen perception and the strength\r\nto recognize the increasing weakness of the government, and also to\r\ndespise the enervation and corruption of its citizens. The German was\r\nambitious and restless as daily he regarded Rome more and more as his\r\nprey. The Romans themselves saw the danger of the Empire and lived in\r\napprehension of overwhelming incursions long before they came. In the\r\nlatter part of the fourth century the great impulse was given to the\r\npeople of northern and eastern Europe by successive invasions from\r\nAsia; and a vast and general movement began among them which resulted\r\nin the disintegration of the Roman Empire, and the transfer of the\r\nprincipal arena of history from the shores of the Mediterranean Sea\r\nto the countries in which the great powers of modern Europe afterward\r\ngrew up. The first impulse to this series of events was given by\r\ndisturbances and migrations in central Asia, of whose cause hardly\r\nanything is known. Long before the Christian era there was a powerful\r\nrace of Huns in northeastern Asia who became so dangerous to the\r\nChinese that the great wall of China was built as a defense against\r\nthem (finished B. C. 244).[E]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThese Huns, a Mongol race, had migrated from the center of Asia\r\nwestward three-quarters of a century previously (A. D. 375), carrying\r\ndeath and devastation on their path. They had nothing in common with\r\nthe peoples of the West, either in facial features or habits of life.\r\nContemporary historians describe them as surpassing by their savagery\r\nall that can be imagined. They were of low stature, with broad\r\nshoulders, thick-set limbs, flat noses, high cheek-bones, small eyes\r\ndeeply sunk in the sockets, and yellow complexion. Ammianus Marcellinus\r\ncompares them, in their monstrous ugliness, to beasts walking on two\r\nlegs, or the grinning heads clumsily carved on the posts of bridges.\r\nThey had no beard, because from infancy their faces were hideously\r\nscarred by being slashed all over, in order to hinder its growth.\r\nAccustomed to lead a wandering life in their native country, these wild\r\nhordes traversed the Steppes, or boundless plains which lie between\r\nRussia and China, in huge chariots, or on small hardy horses, changing\r\ntheir stations as often as fresh pasture was required for their cattle.\r\nExcept constrained by necessity, they never entered any kind of house,\r\nholding them in horror as so many tombs. They were accustomed from\r\ninfancy to endure cold, hunger, and thirst. As the great boots they\r\nwore deprived them of all facility in marching, they never fought on\r\nfoot; but the skill with which they managed their horses and threw\r\nthe javelin, made them more formidable to the Germans than even the\r\ndisciplined, but less ferocious, legions of Rome.\r\n\r\nThis was the rude race which, bursting into Europe in the second half\r\nof the fourth century, shook the whole barbarian world to its center,\r\nand precipitated it upon the Roman Empire. The Goths fled before them,\r\nwhen they passed the Danube, the Vandals when they crossed the Rhine.\r\nAfter a halt of half a century in the center of Europe, the Huns put\r\nthemselves again in motion.\r\n\r\nAttila, the king of this people, constrained all the tribes wandering\r\nbetween the Rhine and the Oural to follow him. For some time he\r\nhesitated upon which of the two empires he should carry the wrath of\r\nheaven. Deciding upon the West, he passed the Rhine, the Moselle, and\r\nthe Seine, and marched upon Orleans. The populations fled before him in\r\nindescribable terror, for the _Scourge of God_, as he was called, left\r\nnot one stone upon another wheresoever he passed. Metz and twenty other\r\ncities had been destroyed. Troyes alone had been saved by its bishop,\r\nSaint Loup. He wished to seize upon Orleans, the key of the southern\r\nprovinces; and his innumerable army surrounded the city. Its bishop,\r\nSt. Aignan, sustained the courage of the inhabitants by promising them\r\na powerful succor. Ætius, in fact, arrived with all the barbarian\r\nnations encamped in Gaul, at the expense of which the new invasion was\r\nmade. Attila for the first time fell back; but in order to choose a\r\nbattle-field favorable for his cavalry, he halted in the Catalaunian\r\nplains near Méry-sur-Seine. There the terrible shock of battle took\r\nplace. In the first onset the Franks, who formed the vanguard of Ætius,\r\nfought with such animosity that 15,000 Huns strewed the plain. But\r\nnext day, when the great masses on both sides encountered, the bodies\r\nof 165,000 combatants were left on that field of carnage. Attila was\r\nconquered. The allies, however, not daring to drive the wild Huns to\r\ndespair, suffered Attila to retreat into Germany (451). In the year\r\nfollowing he made amends for his defeat by an invasion of northern\r\nItaly, ravaging Aquileia, Milan, and other cities in a frightful\r\nmanner, but died of an apoplectic stroke (453), soon after his return,\r\nand his empire fell with him, but not the terrible remembrance of his\r\nname and of his cruelties. The Visigoths, whose king had perished in\r\nthe fight, and the Franks of Meroveus, had had, with Ætius, the chief\r\nhonor of that memorable day in the Catalaunian plains. For it had\r\nbecome a question whether Europe should be German or Mongolian, whether\r\nthe fierce Huns or the Germans should found an empire on the ruins of\r\nthat which was then crumbling.[F]\r\n\r\n\r\nFALL OF THE WESTERN EMPIRE—MANNERS AND MORALS OF THE GERMANS IN THIS\r\nAGE.\r\n\r\nThe Western Empire had now but a short time to live. The dastardly\r\nemperor Valentinian III., suspicious of the independent position of\r\nÆtius, recalled the conqueror of Attila from Gaul, and slew him with\r\nhis own hand (A. D. 454). He was himself murdered soon after, and his\r\nwidow, Eudoxia, though forced to marry the assassin, determined to\r\navenge her husband. She invited the Vandals, for this purpose, from\r\nAfrica across the sea to Rome. This German tribe, still ruled by the\r\naged Genseric, was the only one which possessed a fleet; and by this\r\nmeans the Vandals had already made themselves masters of the great\r\nislands of the Mediterranean, of Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica. The\r\n“sea-king” eagerly obeyed the summons (A. D. 455), and now “golden\r\nRome” was given up for fourteen days to his soldiers, and was sacked\r\nwith such horrors that the name of Vandal has ever since been a proverb\r\nfor barbarity and destruction. Yet the mediation of Leo the Great, then\r\nBishop of Rome, saved the city from utter ruin. From this time onward\r\nthe emperors, who followed one another in quick succession, were mere\r\ntools of the German generals, and symbols of power before the common\r\npeople; for the whole imperial army now consisted of the remnants of\r\nvarious German nations, who had sought service for pay. These too, at\r\nlast, like their kindred in the provinces, demanded lands in Italy, and\r\nwould have no less than one-third of the soil. When this was refused,\r\nOdoacer, at the head of his soldiers—Heruli, Sciri, Turcilingi, and\r\nRugii, who forced their way thither from the Danube—put an end to the\r\nvery name of the Roman Empire, stripping the boy Romulus Augustulus,\r\nthe last emperor, of the purple, and ruling alone in Italy, as German\r\ngeneral and king. Thus the Western Empire fell by German hands, after\r\nthey had already wrested from it all its provinces, Africa, Spain, Gaul\r\nand Britain. This occurred in the year 476. Ancient history ends with\r\nthis event; but in the history of the Germans it is merely an episode.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the great migrations, the German tribes were barbarians,\r\nin that they were destitute alike of humanity toward enemies and\r\ninferiors, and of scientific culture. Neither the pursuit of learning\r\nnor the practice of mercy to the vanquished could seem to them other\r\nthan unmanly weakness. Their ferocity spread misery and ruin through\r\nthe whole arena of history, and made the fifth and sixth centuries of\r\nour era the crowning epoch in the annals of human suffering; while\r\ntheir active, passionate contempt for learning destroyed the existing\r\nmonuments of intelligence and habits of inquiry and thought, almost\r\nas completely as they swept away the wealth, prosperity, and social\r\norganization of the Roman world. Their ablest kings despised clerical\r\naccomplishments. Even Theodoric the Great could not write, and his\r\nsignature was made by a black smear over a form or mould in which his\r\nname was cut. Nevertheless these nations were not what we mean by\r\nsavages. Their originally beautiful and resonant language was already\r\ncultivated in poetical forms, in heroic songs. There was intercourse\r\nand trade among the several nations. Minstrels, especially, passed\r\nfrom one royal court to another, and the same song which was sung to\r\nTheodoric in Ravenna could be heard and understood by the Vandals\r\nin Carthage, by Clovis in Paris, and by the Thuringians in their\r\nfastnesses. A common language was a strong bond of union among these\r\nnations. Messengers, embassies, and letters were sent to and fro\r\nbetween their courts; gifts were exchanged, and marriages and alliances\r\nentered into. Thus the nations were informed concerning one another,\r\nand recognized their mutual relationship. It was this international\r\nintercourse that gave rise to the heroic minstrelsy—a faithful relation\r\nof the great deeds of German heroes during the migrations; but the\r\nminstrel boldly transforms the order of events, and brings together\r\nthings which in reality took place at intervals of whole generations.\r\nThus they sing of Hermanric, of Theodoric the Great (Dietrich the\r\nStrong, of Berne), and of his faithful knight Hildebrand; then of\r\nthe fall of the Burgundian kings, of the far-ruling Attila, and of\r\nSigurd, or Siegfried, who was originally a Northern god of spring, but\r\nhere appears as a youthful hero, faithful and child-like, simple and\r\nunsuspicious, yet the mightiest of all—the complete image of the German\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nThese wild times of warfare and wandering could not, of course,\r\nfavorably affect morals and character. They did much to root out of\r\nthe minds and lives of the people their ancient heathen faith and\r\npractices. Their old gods were associated with places, scenes, features\r\nof the country and the climate; and, with these out of sight, the gods\r\nthemselves were easily forgotten. Moreover, the local deities of other\r\nplaces and nations were brought into notice. The people’s religious\r\nhabits were broken up, their minds confused, and thus they were better\r\nprepared than before to embrace the new and universal doctrines of\r\nChristianity. But the wanderings had a bad effect on morality in all\r\nforms. The upright German was still distinguished by his self-respect\r\nfrom the false, faithless, and cowardly “Welshman,” whose nature had\r\nbecome deformed through years of servitude. But Germans, too, were\r\nnow often guilty of faithlessness and cruelty; and some tribes grew\r\neffeminate and corrupt, especially the Vandals in luxurious Africa.\r\nThey imitated the style of the conquered in dress, arms, and manner\r\nof life; and some adopted their language also. For instance, even\r\nTheodoric the Great corresponded in Latin with foreign monarchs; and as\r\nearly as the sixth and seventh centuries, the Germans recorded their\r\nown laws in Latin, the West Goths and Burgundians introducing the\r\npractice, which was followed by the Franks, Alemanni, Bavarians, and\r\nLangobards. These laws, and the prohibitions they contain, are the best\r\nsources of information upon the manners of the time, and especially\r\nupon the condition of the lower orders, the peasants, and the slaves.\r\nThe most frequent cases provided are of bodily injuries, murder,\r\nwounds, and mutilations, showing that the warlike disposition had\r\ndegenerated into cruelty and coarseness. For all these injuries, the\r\nweregeld, or ransom, was still a satisfaction. The life of a nobleman,\r\nthat of a freeman, of a slave, and the members of the body—the eye,\r\near, nose, and hand—were assessed each at a fixed money valuation,\r\nto be paid by the aggressor, if he would not expose himself to the\r\nvengeance of the wronged man or his family. But crimes committed by\r\npeasants and slaves were punished by death, sometimes at the stake,\r\nwhere freemen might escape by paying a fine. The oaths of parties and\r\nwitnesses were heard; and they were sustained by the oaths of others,\r\ntheir friends, relations, or partisans, who swore that they were to\r\nbe believed. If an accused party swore that he was innocent, it was\r\nonly necessary for him to obtain a sufficient number of compurgators,\r\nor jurors, of his own rank to swear that they believed him, in order\r\nto secure acquittal. But the number required was much larger for men\r\nof low rank than for the nobles; and the freedmen and slaves had no\r\nrights of the kind, but were tortured at will to compel them to confess\r\nor testify. The slaves were often tried by an ordeal, and were held\r\nguilty of any accusation if they could not put their hands into boiling\r\nwater without harm. For freemen, if no other evidence were accessible,\r\na trial by battle was adopted, as an appeal to God’s judgment. The\r\nheathen tribes in Germany proper—the Frisi, Saxons, Thuringians, and\r\nAlemanni—lived on in their old ways; yet they too failed to maintain\r\nthe spotless character assigned them by Tacitus. It was a time of\r\ngeneral ferment. The new elements of civilization had brought with them\r\nnew vices, and the simplicity of earlier days could not survive.[G]\r\n\r\n    [To be continued.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRIGHT well I know that improvement is a duty, and as we see man strives\r\never after a higher point, at least he seeks some novelty. But beware!\r\nfor with these feelings Nature has given us also a desire to continue\r\nin the old ways, and to take pleasure in that to which we have been\r\naccustomed. Every condition of man is good which is natural and in\r\naccordance with reason. Man’s desires are boundless, but his wants are\r\nfew. For his days are short, and his fate bounded by a narrow span. I\r\nfind no fault with the man who, ever active and restless, crosses every\r\nsea and braves the rude extremes of every clime, daring and diligent in\r\npursuit of gain, rejoicing his heart and house by wealth.—_Goethe._\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] Bayard Taylor.\r\n\r\n[B] Tacitus.\r\n\r\n[C] Bayard Taylor.\r\n\r\n[D] Sime.\r\n\r\n[E] Lewis.\r\n\r\n[F] Sime.\r\n\r\n[G] Lewis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMAN LITERATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the Germans, as among all other nations, the earliest literature\r\nis poetical. Little is preserved of their ancient poetry, but Tacitus\r\ntells us that the Germans of his time had ancient songs relating to\r\nTuisco and Mannus, and to the hero Arminius. It is the opinion of many\r\ncritics that the stories of “Reynard, the Fox,” and “Isengrim, the\r\nWolf,” may be traced back to these remote times. The legends of the\r\n“Nibelungenlied” have many marks of antiquity which would place them in\r\nthis pre-historic age. The first definite period, however, is:\r\n\r\nI. THE EARLY MIDDLE AGE.—When the German tribes accepted Christianity,\r\nthe clergy strove to replace the native poetry by the stories of the\r\ngospel. In the fourth century Bishop Ulfilas prepared a clear, faithful\r\nand simple translation of the Scriptures, which has since been of value\r\nin the study of the Teutonic languages. Charles the Great overpowered\r\nthe effort the priests had made to check poetry by issuing orders to\r\ncollect the old German ballads. But few of these treasures of Old High\r\nand Low German literature have come down to us. Later the Church still\r\nfurther counteracted the influences of pagan literature by a religious\r\npoetry in which the life of Christ was sung in verse. Scholastic\r\nlearning was also zealously cultivated in the monasteries and schools.\r\n\r\nII. THE AGE OF CHIVALRY.—Under the Hohenstaufen dynasty during the\r\nperiod of Middle High German the country passed through one of the\r\ngreatest epochs of its literature. The most characteristic outcome\r\nof this active era is a series of poetical romances produced in the\r\ntwelfth and thirteenth centuries. In these romances the subject of\r\nwhatever epoch it might be, was treated wholly in the spirit of\r\nchivalry, the supreme aim was to furnish an idealized picture of the\r\nvirtues of knighthood. Wolfram von Eschenbach was one of the most\r\nbrilliant of these writers; “Parzival,” his chief poem, is purely\r\nimaginative. The hero is made to pass from a life of dreams to one of\r\nadventure, finally to become lord of the palace of the Holy Grail.\r\nIts object is to show the restless spirit of the Middle Ages, which,\r\ncontinually discontent with life, sought a nobler place.\r\n\r\nGottfried, of Strasburg, was a complete contrast to Wolfram and his\r\ngreatest contemporary. Tristam and Iseult is his theme. Mediæval\r\nromance bore its richest fruit in these two poets, and most of their\r\nsuccessors imitated either one or the other. To this age belongs the\r\nfamous epic, the “Nibelungenlied,” in which many ancient ballads have\r\nbeen collected and arranged. “Gudrun” is another epic in which a poet\r\nof this period has given form to several old legends. But lyrics as\r\nwell as romances and epics mark the age of chivalry. The poets of this\r\nclass were known as _minnesänger_ because their favorite theme was\r\n_minne_ or love. Of all the _minnesänger_ the first place belongs to\r\nWalther von der Vogelweide. He wrote poems of patriotism as well as on\r\nthe usual subjects of lyric verse.\r\n\r\nTo this epoch belong the beginnings of prose in German literature.\r\nLatin was the speech of scholars, and prose works were almost uniformly\r\nin that language. The “Sachenspiegel” and “Schwabenspiegel,” two\r\ncollections of local laws, aroused interest among Germans in their\r\nlanguage. The preachers, however, were the chief founders of prose\r\nstyle. Dissatisfied with the abuses and mere forms under which genuine\r\nspiritual life was crushed, they strove to awaken new and truer ideas\r\nof religion. A Franciscan monk, Berthold, and Eckhart are the two to\r\nwhom most is due.\r\n\r\nIII. THE LATER MIDDLE AGE.—After the fall of the Hohenstaufen dynasty,\r\nchivalry died out in Germany, and with it the incentive to poetry.\r\nDuring the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, attempts were made to\r\nproduce poetry by rule. As every trade has its guild, so there was\r\nformed a guild of poetry, in which the members made their verses by the\r\n“_tabulatur_,” and were obliged to pass through successive stages up\r\nto the “_meistersänger_.” More important were the efforts at dramatic\r\ncomposition. They were crude representations of scriptural subjects,\r\nwith which the clergy sought to replace the pagan festivals. Out of\r\nthese representations grew the “mysteries,” or “miracle plays,” in\r\nwhich there was an endeavor to dramatize sacred subjects. “Shrove\r\nTuesday plays” were dialogues, setting forth some scene of noisy fun,\r\nand were the first attempts at comedy.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of the fifteenth century there was in Germany,\r\nas in other European countries, a great revival of intellectual life.\r\nIt was due to two things—the re-discovery of Greek literature and the\r\ninvention of printing. In the universities a broader culture took the\r\nplace of scholastic studies. Many books found their way to the people,\r\nbut these were mainly on social questions. The tyranny of princes and\r\nabuses of the clergy were the topics for the times, and multitudes of\r\nbooks were written ridiculing princes, priests, nobles, and even the\r\nPope. The greatest of these satires was “Reineke Vos,” by Barkhusen,\r\na printer of Rostock. During this stirring period Maximilian I. was\r\nemperor, and attempted to revive the mediæval romance. His success was\r\nnot great, and in no sense affected popular taste.\r\n\r\nIV. THE CENTURY OF THE REFORMATION.—While the Renaissance brought\r\nabout a great literary movement in England and France, and an artistic\r\nmovement in Italy, in Germany the Reformation agitated the nation.\r\nLuther was the commanding spirit of the age in literature, as in\r\nreligion. His greatest achievement was his translation of the Bible.\r\nFor the first time a literary language was given to the nation. Luther\r\ngave to the men of all the countries of Germany a common speech, so\r\nthat it is to him that the Germans owe the most essential of all the\r\nconditions of a national life and literature. Next to Luther stands\r\nUlrich Von Hutten, an accomplished defender of the new culture and of\r\nthe Reformation. Hans Sachs, the meistersänger of Nuremburg, is now\r\nacknowledged to be the chief German poet of the sixteenth century. He\r\nwrote more than six thousand poems. His hymn, “Warum betrübst du dich,\r\nmein Herz,” was soon translated into eight languages. The religious\r\nlyrics of this age were of superior worth. Indeed, next to the\r\ntranslation of the Bible, nothing did so much to unite the Protestants.\r\nDuring this century the drama made considerable progress.\r\n\r\nV. THE PERIOD OF DECAY.—This period is in many respects the most\r\ndismal in German history. During the seventeenth century little poetry\r\nof worth was produced. No progress was made in the formation of the\r\ndrama, and few prose works were written that are now tolerated. The one\r\nbrilliant thinker of the age was Leibnitz.\r\n\r\nVI. THE PERIOD OF REVIVAL.—With the accession of Frederick the Great,\r\na stronger national life sprung up in Germany, and literature shared\r\nthe growth. Several causes contributed to the advance of literature;\r\nthe revival of classical learning, and a knowledge of English\r\nliterature were chief. Several literary schools grew up. Important\r\nas were many of the writers in them, they exercised slight influence\r\non the national mind compared with founders of the German classical\r\nliterature—Klopstock, Wieland, and Lessing. Klopstock’s fame mainly\r\nrests on the “Messiah,” a work now little read, and if defective, yet\r\nfull of striking and beautiful images. Klopstock’s odes are superior to\r\nhis dramas, the latter showing knowledge neither of the stage nor of\r\nlife. His influence upon intellectual life in Germany was very marked.\r\n\r\nWieland was one of the most prolific of writers. “Oberon” is the most\r\npleasing of his poems to modern readers, and by far most famous.\r\n“Agathon” is his best prose romance. Although at first a strong\r\npietist, Wieland eventually became a pronounced epicurean. Lessing,\r\nthe third of these great poets, is the only writer before Goethe that\r\nGermans now read sympathetically. As an imaginative writer he was\r\nchiefly distinguished in the drama, and his most important dramatic\r\nwork is “Minna Von Barnhelm.” Superior to his imaginative works were\r\nhis labors as a thinker. His style ranks with the greatest European\r\nwriters, and his criticisms are of great value.\r\n\r\nVII. THE CLASSICAL PERIOD.—About 1770 there began in German literary\r\nlife a curious movement called “_Sturm und Drang_” (storm and\r\npressure). Almost all young writers were under its influence. Its most\r\nprominent quality was discontent with the existing world. The critical\r\nguide of the movement was Herder. To him is due the impulse which\r\nled to a collection of the songs and ballads of the people. His most\r\nimportant prose work was “Ideas Toward the Philosophy of the History\r\nof Humanity.” To Herder belongs the honor of stimulating the genius\r\nof Goethe, who holds in German literature the place of Shakspere in\r\nEnglish. His extraordinary range of activity is his most wonderful\r\ncharacteristic. Goethe’s first published work placed him among the\r\nwriters of the “_Sturm und Drang_” school, as was true of the earlier\r\nworks of Schiller. The lyrics of Goethe have perhaps the most subtle\r\ncharm of all his writings, but “Hermann und Dorothea,” “Wilhelm\r\nMeister,” “Faust,” etc., are his great productions. Schiller, Goethe’s\r\ngreat rival, divided with him the public attention and interest.\r\nSchiller’s literary career began when he was only twenty-two. “The\r\nRobbers” and “Don Carlos” are his principal early works. It was in 1794\r\nthat Goethe and Schiller began that acquaintance which ripened into\r\none of the most beautiful friendships in the history of literature.\r\nThey wrote in common on Schiller’s journal “Die Horen,” and many of\r\nSchiller’s works were influenced by the larger life of his friend. This\r\nis particularly true of his dramas, “Wallenstein,” “Die Jungfrau von\r\nOrleans,” “Maria Stuart,” and “Wilhelm Tell.”\r\n\r\nIn 1781 one of the most important works of German literature was\r\npublished—Kant’s “Kritik der Reinen Vernunft.” The philosophical\r\nsystems of Fichte, Schelling and Hegel followed, and excited even\r\ngreater interest than the writings of the imaginative writers.\r\n\r\nEach of the leading writers of the classical period had numerous\r\nfollowers, but the most important band was that which at first grew up\r\naround Goethe—the romantic school. The aim of the school was to revive\r\nmediævalism—to link daily life to poetry. The writer known as the\r\nprophet of the school was Frederick von Hardenburg, generally called\r\nNovalis. The critical leaders were Wilhelm and Friedrich von Schlegel.\r\nTieck, Nackenroder, Fouquè, and Schleiermacher were the chief writers.\r\n\r\nVIII. THE LATEST PERIOD.—In 1832, with the death of Goethe, a new\r\nera began in German literature. In philosophy the school of Hegel,\r\nwho wrote during the lifetime of Goethe, has had many enthusiastic\r\nadherents; among these were Strauss, Ruge and Feuerbach. Schopenhauer,\r\nalthough he wrote his chief book during the time of Goethe at present\r\nstirs deeper interest than any other thinker.\r\n\r\nIn imaginative literature the greatest writer of the latest period is\r\nHeinrich Heine, whose lyrics have attracted general attention. The\r\nnovel has acquired the same important place in Germany as in England.\r\nAmong the chief novelists are Freytag, the Countess Ida Hahn-Hahn, Paul\r\nHeyse, Spielhagen and Reuter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEVERYTHING that regards statesmanship and the interest of the world\r\nis in all outward respects of the greatest importance; it creates\r\nand destroys in a moment the happiness, even the very existence, of\r\nthousands, but when the wave of the moment has rushed past, and the\r\nstorm has abated, its influence is lost, and even frequently disappears\r\nwithout leaving a trace behind. Many other things that are noiselessly\r\ninfluencing the thoughts and feelings often make far deeper and more\r\nlasting impressions on us. Man can for the most part keep himself very\r\nindependent of all that does not trench on his private life—a very wise\r\narrangement of Providence, since it gives a much greater security to\r\nhuman happiness.—_William von Humboldt._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL SCIENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.—THE CIRCULATION OF WATER ON THE LAND.\r\n\r\nAlthough air is continually evaporating water from the surface of the\r\nearth, and continually restoring it again by condensation, yet, on the\r\nwhole and in the course of years, there seems to be no sensible gain or\r\nloss of water in our seas, lakes, and rivers; so that the two processes\r\nof evaporation and condensation balance each other.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, however, that the moisture precipitated at any moment\r\nfrom the air is not at once evaporated again. The disappearance of the\r\nwater is due in part to evaporation, but only in part. A great deal of\r\nit goes out of sight in other ways.\r\n\r\nThe rain which falls upon the sea is the largest part of the whole\r\nrainfall of the globe, because the surface of the sea is about three\r\ntimes greater than that of the land. All this rain gradually mingles\r\nwith the salt water, and can then be no longer recognized. It thus\r\nhelps to make up for the loss which the sea is always suffering by\r\nevaporation. For the sea is the great evaporating surface whence most\r\nof the vapor of the atmosphere is derived.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the total amount of rain which falls upon the land\r\nof the globe must be enormous. It has been estimated, for example,\r\nthat about sixty-eight cubic miles of water annually descend as rain\r\neven upon the surface of the British Isles, and there are many much\r\nmore rainy regions. If you inquire about this rain which falls upon\r\nthe land, you will find that it does not at once disappear, but begins\r\nanother kind of circulation. Watch what happens during a shower of\r\nrain. If the shower is heavy, you will notice little runs of muddy\r\nwater coursing down the streets or roads, or flowing out of the ridges\r\nof the fields. Follow one of the runs. It leads into some drain or\r\nbrook, that into some larger stream, the stream into a river; and the\r\nriver, if you follow it far enough, will bring you to the sea. Now\r\nthink of all the brooks and rivers of the world, where this kind of\r\ntransport of water is going on, and you will at once see how vast must\r\nbe the part of the rain which flows off the land into the ocean.\r\n\r\nBut does the whole of the rain flow off at once into the sea in this\r\nway? A good deal of the rain which falls upon the land must sink\r\nunderground and gather there. You may think that surely the water which\r\ndisappears in that way must be finally withdrawn from the general\r\ncirculation which we have been tracing. When it sinks below the\r\nsurface, how can it ever get up to the surface again?\r\n\r\nYet, if you consider for a little, you will be convinced that whatever\r\nbecomes of it underneath, it can not be lost. If all the rain which\r\nsinks into the ground be forever removed from the surface circulation,\r\nyou will at once see that the quantity of water upon the earth’s\r\nsurface must be constantly and visibly diminishing. But no such\r\nchanges, so far as can be seen, are really taking place. In spite of\r\nthe rain which disappears into the ground, the circulation of water\r\nbetween the air, the land, and the sea continues without perceptible\r\ndiminution.\r\n\r\nYou are driven to conclude, therefore, that there must be some means\r\nwhereby the water underground is brought back to the surface. This\r\nis done by springs, which gush out of the earth, and bring up water\r\nto feed the brooks and rivers, whereby it is borne into the sea.\r\nHere, then, are two distinct courses which the rainfall takes—one\r\nbelow ground, and one above. It will be most convenient to follow the\r\nunderground portion first.\r\n\r\nA little attention to the soils and rocks which form the surface of a\r\ncountry is enough to show that they differ greatly from each other in\r\nhardness, and in texture or grain. Some are quite loose and porous,\r\nothers are tough and close-grained. They consequently differ much\r\nin the quantity of water they allow to pass through them. A bed of\r\nsand, for example, is pervious; that is, will let water sink through\r\nit freely, because the little grains of sand lie loosely together,\r\ntouching each other only at some points, so as to leave empty spaces\r\nbetween. The water readily finds its way among these empty spaces. In\r\nfact, the sand-bed may become a kind of sponge, quite saturated with\r\nthe water which has filtered down from the surface. A bed of clay, on\r\nthe other hand, is impervious; it is made up of very small particles\r\nfitting closely to each other, and therefore offering resistance to\r\nthe passage of water. Wherever such a bed occurs, it hinders the free\r\npassage of the water, which, unable to sink through it from above on\r\nthe way down, or from below on the way up to the surface again, is kept\r\nin by the clay, and forced to find another line of escape.\r\n\r\nSandy soils are dry because the rain at once sinks through them; clay\r\nsoils are wet because they retain the water, and prevent it from freely\r\ndescending into the earth.\r\n\r\nNow the rocks beneath us, besides being in many cases porous in their\r\ntexture, such as sandstone, are all more or less traversed with\r\ncracks—sometimes mere lines, like those of a cracked window-pane, but\r\nsometimes wide and open clefts and tunnels. These numerous channels\r\nserve as passages for the underground water. Hence, although a rock\r\nmay be so hard and close-grained that water does not soak through it\r\nat all, yet if that rock is plentifully supplied with these cracks, it\r\nmay allow a large quantity of water to pass through. Limestone, for\r\nexample, is a very hard rock, through the grains of which water can\r\nmake but little way; yet it is so full of cracks or “joints,” as they\r\nare called, and these joints are often so wide, that they give passage\r\nto a great deal of water.\r\n\r\nIn hilly districts, where the surface of the ground has not been\r\nbrought under the plow, you will notice that many places are marshy\r\nand wet, even when the weather has long been dry. The soil everywhere\r\naround has perhaps been baked quite hard by the sun; but these places\r\nremain still wet, in spite of the heat. Whence do they get their\r\nwater? Plainly not directly from the air, for in that case the rest of\r\nthe ground would also be damp. They get it not from above, but from\r\nbelow. It is oozing out of the ground; and it is this constant outcome\r\nof water from below which keeps the ground wet and marshy. In other\r\nplaces you will observe that the water does not merely soak through the\r\nground, but gives rise to a little run of clear water. If you follow\r\nsuch a run up to its source, you will see that it comes gushing out of\r\nthe ground as a spring.\r\n\r\nSprings are the natural outlets for the underground water. But, you\r\nask, why should this water have any outlets, and what makes it rise to\r\nthe surface?\r\n\r\nLet us suppose that a flat layer of some impervious rock, like clay,\r\nunderlies another layer of a porous material, like sand. The rain which\r\nfalls on the surface of the ground, and sinks through the upper bed,\r\nwill be arrested by the lower one, and made either to gather there, or\r\nfind its escape along the surface of that lower bed. If a hollow or\r\nvalley should have its bottom below the level of the line along which\r\nthe water flows, springs will gush out along the sides of the valley.\r\nThe line of escape may be either the junction between two different\r\nkinds of rock, or some of the numerous joints already referred to.\r\nWhatever it be, the water can not help flowing onward and downward, as\r\nlong as there is any passage along which it can find its way; and the\r\nrocks underneath are so full of cracks, that it has no difficulty in\r\ndoing so.\r\n\r\nBut it must happen that a great deal of the underground water descends\r\nfar below the level of the valleys, and even below the level of the\r\nsea. And yet, though it should descend for several miles, it comes at\r\nlast to the surface again. To realize clearly how this takes place,\r\nlet us follow a particular drop of water from the time when it sinks\r\ninto the earth as rain, to the time when, after a long journey up and\r\ndown in the bowels of the earth, it once more reaches the surface.\r\nIt soaks through the soil together with other drops, and joins some\r\nfeeble trickle, or some more ample flow of water, which works its way\r\nthrough crevices and tunnels of the rocks. It sinks in this way to\r\nperhaps a depth of several thousand feet, until it reaches some rock\r\nthrough which it can not readily make further way. Unable to work its\r\nway downward, the pent-up water must try to find escape in some other\r\ndirection. By the pressure from above it is driven through other cracks\r\nand passages, winding up and down until at last it comes to the surface\r\nagain. It breaks out there as a gushing spring.\r\n\r\nRain is water nearly in a state of purity. After journeying up and\r\ndown underground it comes out again in springs, always more or less\r\nmingled with other materials, which it gets from the rocks through\r\nwhich it travels. They are not visible to the eye, for they are held\r\nin what is called chemical solution. When you put a few grains of salt\r\nor sugar upon a plate, and pour water over them, they are dissolved in\r\nthe water and disappear. They enter into union with the water. You can\r\nnot see them, but you can still recognize their presence by the taste\r\nwhich they give to the water which holds them in solution. So water,\r\nsinking from the soil downward, dissolves a little of the substance\r\nof the subterranean rocks, and carries this dissolved material up to\r\nthe surface of the ground. One of the important ingredients in the air\r\nis carbonic acid gas, and this substance is both abstracted from and\r\nsupplied to the air by plants and animals. In descending through the\r\natmosphere rain absorbs a little air. As ingredients of the air, a\r\nlittle carbonic acid gas, particles of dust and soot, noxious vapors,\r\nminute organisms, and other substances floating in the air, are caught\r\nup by the descending rain, which in this way washes the air, and tends\r\nto keep it much more wholesome than it would otherwise be.\r\n\r\nBut rain not merely picks up impurities from the air, it gets a large\r\naddition when it reaches the soil.\r\n\r\nArmed with the carbonic acid which it gets from the air, and with the\r\nlarger quantity which it abstracts from the soil, rainwater is prepared\r\nto attack rocks, and to eat into them in a way which pure water could\r\nnot do.\r\n\r\nWater containing carbonic acid has a remarkable effect on many rocks,\r\neven on some of the very hardest. It dissolves more or less of their\r\nsubstance, and removes it. When it falls, for instance, on chalk or\r\nlimestone, it almost entirely dissolves and carries away the rock\r\nin solution, though still remaining clear and limpid. In countries\r\nwhere chalk or limestone is an abundant rock, this action of water\r\nis sometimes singularly shown in the way in which the surface of the\r\nground is worn into hollows. In such districts, too, the springs are\r\nalways hard; that is, they contain much mineral matter in solution,\r\nwhereas rainwater and springs which contain little impurity are termed\r\nsoft.\r\n\r\nWhen a stone building has stood for a few hundred years, the\r\nsmoothly-dressed face which its walls received from the mason is\r\nusually gone. Again, in the burying-ground surrounding a venerable\r\nchurch you see the tombstones more and more mouldered the older they\r\nare. This crumbling away of hard stone with the lapse of time is a\r\ncommon familiar fact to you. But have you ever wondered why it should\r\nbe so? What makes the stone decay, and what purpose is served by the\r\nprocess?\r\n\r\nIf it seem strange to you to be told that the surface of the earth is\r\ncrumbling away, you should take every opportunity of verifying the\r\nstatement. Examine your own district. You will find proofs that, in\r\nspite of their apparent steadfastness, even the hardest stones are\r\nreally crumbling down. In short, wherever rocks are exposed to the air\r\nthey are liable to decay. Now let us see how this change is brought\r\nabout.\r\n\r\nFirst of all we must return for a moment to the action of carbonic\r\nacid, which has been already described. You remember that rainwater\r\nabstracts a little carbonic acid from the air, and that, when it sinks\r\nunder the earth, it is enabled by means of the acid to eat away some\r\nparts of the rocks beneath. The same action takes place with the rain,\r\nwhich rests upon or flows over the surface of the ground. The rainwater\r\ndissolves out little by little such portions of the rocks as it can\r\nremove. In the case of some rocks, such as limestone, the whole, or\r\nalmost the whole, of the substance of the rock is carried away in\r\nsolution. In other kinds, the portion dissolved is the cementing\r\nmaterial whereby the mass of the rock was bound together; so that when\r\nit is taken away, the rock crumbles into mere earth or sand, which\r\nis readily washed away by the rain. Hence one of the causes of the\r\nmouldering of stone is the action of the carbonic acid taken up by the\r\nrain.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, the oxygen of the portion of air contained in\r\nrainwater helps to decompose rocks. When a piece of iron has been\r\nexposed for a time to the weather, in a damp climate, it rusts. This\r\nrust is a compound substance, formed by the union of oxygen with iron.\r\nWhat happens to an iron railing or a steel knife, happens also, though\r\nnot so quickly nor so strongly, to many rocks. They, too, rust by\r\nabsorbing oxygen. A crust of corroded rock forms on their surface, and,\r\nwhen it is knocked off by the rain, a fresh layer of rock is reached by\r\nthe ever-present and active oxygen.\r\n\r\nIn the third place, the surface of many parts of the world is made to\r\ncrumble down by means of frost. Sometimes during winter, when the cold\r\ngets very keen, pipes full of water burst, and jugs filled with water\r\ncrack from top to bottom. The reason of this lies in the fact that\r\nwater expands in freezing. Ice requires more space than the water would\r\nif it remained fluid. When ice forms within a confined space, it exerts\r\na great pressure on the sides of the vessel, or cavity, which contains\r\nit. If these sides are not strong enough to bear the strain to which\r\nthey are put, they must yield, and therefore they crack.\r\n\r\nYou have learned how easily rain finds its way through soil. Even the\r\nhardest rocks are more or less porous, and take in some water. Hence,\r\nwhen winter comes the ground is full of moisture; not in the soil\r\nmerely, but in the rocks. And so, as frost sets in, this pervading\r\nmoisture freezes. Now, precisely the same kind of action takes place\r\nwith each particle of water, as in the case of the water in the burst\r\nwater-pipe or the cracked jar. It does not matter whether the water is\r\ncollected into some hole or crevice, or is diffused between the grains\r\nof the rocks and the soil. When it freezes it expands, and in so doing\r\ntries to push asunder the walls between which it is confined.\r\n\r\nWater freezes not only between the component grains, but in the\r\nnumerous crevices or joints, as they are called, by which rocks are\r\ntraversed. You have, perhaps, noticed that on the face of a cliff, or\r\nin a quarry, the rock is cut through by lines running more or less in\r\nan upright direction, and that by means of these lines the rock is\r\nsplit up by nature, and can be divided by the quarrymen into large\r\nfour-sided blocks or pillars. These lines, or joints, have been already\r\nreferred to as passages for water in descending from the surface. You\r\ncan understand that only a very little water may be admitted at a time\r\ninto a joint. But by degrees the joint widens a little, and allows more\r\nwater to enter. Every time the water freezes it tries hard to push\r\nasunder the two sides of the joint. After many winters, it is at last\r\nable to separate them a little; then more water enters, and more force\r\nis exerted in freezing, until at last the block of rock traversed by\r\nthe joint is completely split up. When this takes place along the face\r\nof a cliff, one of the loosened parts may fall and actually roll down\r\nto the bottom of the precipice.\r\n\r\nIn addition to carbonic acid, oxygen, and frost, there are still\r\nother influences at work by which the surface of the earth is made to\r\ncrumble. For example, when, during the day, rocks are highly heated by\r\nstrong sunshine, and then during night are rapidly cooled by radiation,\r\nthe alternate expansion and contraction caused by the extremes of\r\ntemperature loosen the particles of the stone, causing them to crumble\r\naway, or even making successive crusts of the stone fall off.\r\n\r\nAgain, rocks which are at one time well soaked with rain, and at\r\nanother time are liable to be dried by the sun’s rays and by wind,\r\nare apt to crumble away. If then it be true, as it is, that a general\r\nwasting of the surface of the land goes on, you may naturally ask why\r\nthis should be. Out of the crumbled stones all soil is made, and on the\r\nformation and renewal of the soil we depend for our daily food.\r\n\r\nTake up a handful of soil from any field or garden, and look at it\r\nattentively. What is it made of? You see little pieces of crumbling\r\nstone, particles of sand and clay, perhaps a few vegetable fibers; and\r\nthe whole soil has a dark color from the decayed remains of plants\r\nand animals diffused through it. Now let us try to learn how these\r\ndifferent materials have been brought together.\r\n\r\nEvery drop of rain which falls upon the land helps to alter the\r\nsurface. You have followed the chemical action of rain when it\r\ndissolves parts of rocks. It is by the constant repetition of the\r\nprocess, drop after drop, and shower after shower, for years together,\r\nthat the rocks become so wasted and worn. But the rain has also a\r\nmechanical action.\r\n\r\nWatch what happens when the first pattering drops of a shower begin\r\nto fall upon a smooth surface of sand, such as that of a beach. Each\r\ndrop makes a little dint or impression. It thus forces aside the grains\r\nof sand. On sloping ground, where the drops can run together and flow\r\ndownward, they are able to push or carry the particles of sand or clay\r\nalong. This is called a mechanical action; while the actual solution\r\nof the particles, as you would dissolve sugar or salt, is a chemical\r\naction. Each drop of rain may act in either or both of these ways.\r\n\r\nNow you will readily see how it is that rain does so much in the\r\ndestruction of rocks. It not only dissolves out some parts of them, and\r\nleaves a crumbling crust on the surface, but it washes away this crust,\r\nand thereby exposes a fresh surface to decay. There is in this way a\r\ncontinual pushing along of powdered stone over the earth’s surface.\r\nPart of this material accumulates in hollows, and on sloping or level\r\nground; part is swept into the rivers, and carried away into the sea.\r\nAs the mouldering of the surface of the land is always going on, there\r\nis a constant formation of soil. Indeed, if this were not the case,\r\nif after a layer of soil had been formed upon the ground, it were to\r\nremain there unmoved and unrenewed, the plants would by degrees take\r\nout of it all the earthy materials they could, and leave it in a barren\r\nor exhausted state. But some of it is being slowly carried away by\r\nrain, fresh particles from mouldering rocks are being washed over it by\r\nthe same agent, while the rock or sub-soil underneath is all the while\r\ndecaying into soil. The loose stones, too, are continually crumbling\r\ndown and making new earth. And thus, day by day, the soil is slowly\r\nrenewed.\r\n\r\nPlants, also, help to form and renew the soil. They send their roots\r\namong the grains and joints of the stones, and loosen them. Their\r\ndecaying fibers supply most of the carbonic acid by which these stones\r\nare attacked, and furnish also most of the organic matter in the soil.\r\nEven the common worms, which you see when you dig up a spadeful of\r\nearth, are of great service in mixing the soil and bringing what lies\r\nunderneath up to the surface.\r\n\r\nOne part of the rain sinks under the ground, and you have traced its\r\nprogress there until it comes to the surface again. You have now to\r\ntrace, in a similar way, the other portion of the rainfall which flows\r\nalong the surface in brooks and rivers.\r\n\r\nYou can not readily meet with a better illustration of this subject\r\nthan that which is furnished by a gently sloping road during a heavy\r\nshower of rain. Let us suppose that you know such a road, and that\r\njust as the rain is beginning you take up your station at some part\r\nwhere the road has a well-marked descent. At first you notice that each\r\nof the large heavy drops of rain makes in the dust, or sand, one of\r\nthe little dints or rain-prints already described. As the shower gets\r\nheavier these rain-prints are effaced, and the road soon streams with\r\nwater. Now mark in what manner the water moves.\r\n\r\nLooking at the road more narrowly, you remark that it is full of little\r\nroughnesses—at one place a long rut, at another a projecting stone,\r\nwith many more inequalities which your eye could not easily detect\r\nwhen the road was dry, but which the water at once discloses. Every\r\nlittle dimple and projection affects the flow of the water. You see\r\nhow the raindrops gather together into slender streamlets of running\r\nwater which course along the hollows, and how the jutting stones and\r\npieces of earth seem to turn these streamlets now to one side and now\r\nto another.\r\n\r\nToward the top of the slope only feeble runnels of water are to be\r\nseen. But further down they become fewer in number, and at the same\r\ntime larger in size. They unite as they descend; and the larger and\r\nswifter streamlets at the foot of the descent are thus made up of a\r\ngreat many smaller ones from the higher parts of the slope.\r\n\r\nWhy does the water run down the sloping road? why do rivers flow? and\r\nwhy should they always move constantly in the same direction? They do\r\nso for the same reason that a stone falls to the ground when it drops\r\nout of your hand; because they are under the sway of that attraction\r\ntoward the center of the earth, to which, as you know, the name of\r\ngravity is given. Every drop of rain falls to the earth because it is\r\ndrawn downward by the force of this attraction. When it reaches the\r\nground it is still, as much as ever, under the same influence; and it\r\nflows downward in the readiest channel it can find. Its fall from the\r\nclouds to the earth is direct and rapid; its descent from the mountains\r\nto the sea, as part of a stream, is often long and slow; but the cause\r\nof the movement is the same in either case. The winding to and fro of\r\nstreams, the rush of rapids, the roar of cataracts, the noiseless flow\r\nof the deep sullen currents, are all proofs how paramount is the sway\r\nof the law of gravity over the waters of the globe.\r\n\r\nDrawn down in this way by the action of gravity, all that portion of\r\nthe rain which does not sink into the earth must at once begin to move\r\ndownward along the nearest slopes, and continue flowing until it can\r\nget no further. On the surface of the land there are hollows called\r\nlakes, which arrest part of the flowing water, just as there are\r\nhollows on the road which serve to collect some of the rain. But in\r\nmost cases they let the water run out at the lower end as fast as it\r\nruns in at the upper, and therefore do not serve as permanent resting\r\nplaces for the water. The streams which escape from lakes go on as\r\nbefore, working their way to the seashore. So that the course of all\r\nstreams is a downward one; and the sea is the great reservoir into\r\nwhich the water of the land is continually pouring.\r\n\r\nThe brooks and rivers of a country are thus the natural drains, by\r\nwhich the surplus rainfall, not required by the soil or by springs,\r\nis led back again into the sea. When we consider the great amount of\r\nrain, and the enormous number of brooks in the higher parts of the\r\ncountry, it seems, at first, hardly possible for all these streams to\r\nreach the sea without overflowing the lower grounds. But this does not\r\ntake place; for when two streams unite into one, they do not require a\r\nchannel twice as broad as either of their single water-courses. On the\r\ncontrary, such an union gives rise to a stream which is not so broad\r\nas either of the two from which it flows. But it becomes swifter and\r\ndeeper.\r\n\r\nLet us return to the illustration of the roadway in rain. Starting from\r\nthe foot of the slope, you found the streamlets of rain getting smaller\r\nand smaller, and when you came to the top there were none at all. If,\r\nhowever, you were to descend the road on the other side of the ridge,\r\nyou would probably meet with other streamlets coursing down-hill in\r\nthe opposite direction. At the summit the rain seems to divide, part\r\nflowing off to one side, and part to the other.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, were you to ascend some river from the sea, you would\r\nwatch it becoming narrower as you traced it inland, and branching more\r\nand more into tributary streams, and these again subdividing into\r\nalmost endless little brooks. But take any of the branches which unite\r\nto form the main stream, and trace it upward. You come, in the end,\r\nto the first beginnings of a little brook, and going a little further\r\nyou reach the summit, down the other side of which all the streams are\r\nflowing to the opposite quarter. The line which separates two sets of\r\nstreams in this way is called the water-shed. In England, for example,\r\none series of rivers flows into the Atlantic, another into the North\r\nSea. If you trace upon a map a line separating all the upper streams\r\nof the one side from those of the other, that line will mark the\r\nwater-shed of the country.\r\n\r\nBut there is one important point where the illustration of the road\r\nin rain quite fails. It is only when rain is falling, or immediately\r\nafter a heavy shower, that the rills are seen upon the road. When the\r\nrain ceases the water begins to dry up, till in a short time the road\r\nbecomes once more firm and dusty. But the brooks and rivers do not\r\ncease to flow when the rain ceases to fall. In the heat of summer, when\r\nperhaps there has been no rain for many days together, the rivers still\r\nroll on, smaller usually than they were in winter, but still with ample\r\nflow. What keeps them full? If you remember what you have already been\r\ntold about underground water, you will answer that rivers are fed by\r\nsprings as well as by rain.\r\n\r\nThough the weather may be rainless, the springs continue to give out\r\ntheir supplies of water, and these keep the rivers going. But if\r\ngreat drought comes, many of the springs, particularly the shallow\r\nones, cease to flow, and the rivers fed by them shrink up or get dry\r\naltogether. The great rivers of the globe, such as the Mississippi,\r\ndrain such vast territories, that any mere local rain or drought makes\r\nno sensible difference in their mass of water.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of the world, however, the rivers are larger in summer\r\nand autumn than they are in winter and spring. The Rhine, for instance,\r\nbegins to rise as the heat of summer increases, and to fall as the cold\r\nof winter comes on. This happens because the river has its source among\r\nsnowy mountains. Snow melts rapidly in summer, and the water which\r\nstreams from it finds its way into the brooks and rivers, which are\r\nthereby greatly swollen. In winter, on the other hand, the snow remains\r\nunmelted; the moisture which falls from the air upon the mountains\r\nis chiefly snow; and the cold is such as to freeze the brooks. Hence\r\nthe supplies of water at the sources of these rivers are, in winter,\r\ngreatly diminished, and the rivers themselves become proportionately\r\nsmaller.\r\n\r\n    [To be continued.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUNDAY READINGS.\r\n\r\nSelected by REV. J. H. VINCENT, D.D.\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Sunday, November 4._]\r\n\r\nMORAL DISTINCTIONS NOT SUFFICIENTLY REGARDED IN SOCIAL INTERCOURSE.\r\n\r\n    “He that walketh with wise men shall be wise; but a\r\n    companion of fools shall be destroyed.”—_Proverbs\r\n    xiii:20._\r\n\r\nThat “a man may be known by the company he keeps,” has passed into a\r\nproverb among all nations, thus attesting what has been the universal\r\nexperience. The fact would seem to be that a man’s associates either\r\nfind him, or make him like themselves. An acute but severe critic of\r\nmanners, who was too often led by his disposition and circumstances\r\nto sink the philosopher in the satirist, has said: “Nothing is so\r\ncontagious as example. Never was there any considerable good or ill\r\naction, that hath not produced its like. We imitate good ones through\r\nemulation; and bad ones through that malignity in our nature, which\r\nshame conceals, and example sets at liberty.”\r\n\r\nThis being the case, or anything like it, all, I think, must agree\r\nthat moral distinctions are not sufficiently cared for in social\r\nintercourse. In forming our intimacies we are sometimes determined by\r\nthe mere accident of being thrown together; sometimes by a view to\r\nconnections and social position; sometimes by the fascination of what\r\nare called companionable qualities; seldom, I fear, by thoughtful and\r\nserious regard to the influence they are likely to have on character.\r\nWe forget that other attractions, of whatsoever nature, instead of\r\ncompensating for moral unfitness in a companion, only have the effect\r\nto make such unfitness the more to be dreaded.\r\n\r\nLet me introduce what I have to say on the importance of paying more\r\nregard to moral distinctions in the choice of friends, by a few remarks\r\non what are called, by way of distinction, companionable qualities, and\r\non the early manifestation of a free, sociable, confiding turn of mind.\r\nMost parents hail the latter, I believe, as the best of prognostics;\r\nand in some respects it is. It certainly makes the child more\r\ninteresting as a child, and more easily governed; it often passes for\r\nprecocity of talent; at any rate, men are willing to construe it into\r\nevidence of the facility with which he will make his way in the world.\r\nThe father is proud of such a son; the mother idolizes him. If from\r\nany cause he is brought into comparison with a reserved, awkward, and\r\nunyielding boy in the neighborhood, they are ready enough to felicitate\r\nthemselves, and others are ready enough to congratulate them, on the\r\ndifference. And yet I believe I keep within bounds, when I say that, of\r\nthe two, there is more than an even chance that the reserved, awkward,\r\nand unyielding boy will give his parents less occasion for anxiety\r\nand mortification, and become in the end the wiser and better man.\r\nThe reason is, that if a child from natural facility of disposition\r\nis easily won over to good courses, he is also, from the same cause,\r\nliable at any time to be seduced from these good courses into bad\r\nones. On the contrary, where a child, from rigor or stubbornness of\r\ntemper, is peculiarly hard to subdue or manage, there is this hope for\r\na compensation: if by early training, or the experience of life, or a\r\nwise foresight of consequences, he is once set right, he is almost sure\r\nto keep so.\r\n\r\nIt is not enough considered, that, in the present constitution of\r\nsociety, men are not in so much danger from want of good dispositions,\r\nas from want of firmness and steadiness of purpose. Hence it is that\r\ngentle and affectionate minds, more perhaps than any others, stand\r\nin need of solid principle and fixed habits of virtue and piety,\r\nas a safeguard against the lures and fascinations of the world. A\r\nman of a cold, hard, and ungenial nature is comparatively safe so\r\nfar as the temptations of society go: partly because of this very\r\nimpracticableness of his nature, and partly because his companionship\r\nis not likely to be desired or sought even by the bad: he will be\r\nleft to himself. The corrupters of innocence in social intercourse\r\nsingle out for their prey men of companionable qualities. Through\r\nhis companionable qualities the victim is approached, and by his\r\ncompanionable qualities he is betrayed.\r\n\r\nLet me not be misunderstood. Companionable qualities are not objected\r\nto _as such_. When they spring from genuine goodness of heart, and\r\nare the ornament of an upright life, they are as respectable as they\r\nare amiable; and it would be well if Christians and all good men\r\ncultivated them more than they do. If we would make virtue and religion\r\nto be loved, we must make _ourselves_ to be loved _for_ our virtue\r\nand religion; which would be done if we were faithful to carry the\r\ngentleness and charity of the gospel into our manners as well as into\r\nour morals. Nevertheless, we insist that companionable qualities, when\r\nthey have no better source than a sociable disposition, or, worse\r\nstill, an easy temper and loose principles, are full of danger to their\r\npossessor, and full of danger to the community; especially where, from\r\nany cause, but little regard is paid to moral distinctions in social\r\nintercourse. We also say, that in such a state of society the danger\r\nwill be most imminent to those whom we should naturally be most anxious\r\nto save—I mean, persons of a loving and yielding turn of mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Sunday, November 11._]\r\n\r\nAnd this brings me back again to the position taken in the beginning\r\nof this discourse. The reason why companionable qualities are attended\r\nwith so much danger is, that society itself is attended with so much\r\ndanger; and the reason why society is attended with so much danger\r\nis, that social intercourse is not more under the control of moral\r\nprinciples, moral rules, and moral sanctions.\r\n\r\nMy argument does not make it necessary to exaggerate the evils and\r\ndangers of modern society. I am willing to suppose that there have\r\nbeen times when society was much less pure than it is now; and again,\r\nthat there are places where it is much less pure than it is here; but\r\nit does not follow that there are no evils or dangers now and here.\r\nOn the contrary, it is easy to see that there may be stages in the\r\nprogressive improvement of society, where the improvement itself will\r\nhave the effect, not to lessen, but to increase the danger, _so far\r\nas good men are concerned_. In a community where vice abounds, where\r\nthe public manners are notoriously and grossly corrupt, good men are\r\nput on their guard. They will not be injured by such society, for they\r\nwill have nothing to do with it. A broad line of demarcation is drawn\r\nbetween what is expected from good men, and what is expected from bad\r\nmen; so that the example of the latter has no effect on the former\r\nexcept to admonish and to warn. But let the work of refinement and\r\nreform go on in general society until vice is constrained to wear a\r\ndecent exterior, until an air of decorum and respectability is thrown\r\nover all public meetings and amusements, and one consequence will be\r\nthat the distinction between Christians and the world will not be so\r\nclearly seen, or so carefully observed, as before. The standard of the\r\nworld, from the very fact that it is brought nearer to the standard of\r\nthe gospel, will be more frequently confounded with it; Christians will\r\nfeel at liberty to do whatever the world does, and the danger is, that\r\nthey will come at length to do it from the same principles.\r\n\r\nBesides, are we sure that we have not formed too favorable an opinion\r\nof the moral condition of general society—of that general society in\r\nthe midst of which we are now living, and to the influence of which we\r\nare daily and hourly exposed? We should remember that in pronouncing\r\non the character of public opinion and public sentiment, we are very\r\nlikely to be affected and determined ourselves, not a little, by the\r\nfact that we share in that very public opinion and public sentiment\r\nwhich we are called upon to judge. I have no doubt that virtue, in\r\ngeneral, is esteemed by the world, or that, _other things being equal_,\r\na man of integrity will be preferred on account of his integrity. But\r\nthis is not enough. It shows that the multitude see, and are willing\r\nto acknowledge, the dignity and worth of an upright course; but it\r\ndoes not prove them to have that _abhorrence for sin_, which it is\r\nthe purpose and the tendency of the gospel to plant in all minds. If\r\nthey had this settled and rooted abhorrence for sin, which marks the\r\nChristian, and without which a man can not be a Christian, they would\r\nnot prefer virtue to vice, “other things being equal,” but they would\r\ndo so whether other things were equal or not; they would knowingly keep\r\nno terms with vice, however recommended or glossed over by interest or\r\nworldly favor, or refined and elegant manners.\r\n\r\nNow, I ask whether general society, even as it exists amongst us,\r\nwill bear this test? Is it not incontestable that very unscrupulous\r\nand very dangerous men, if they happen to be men of talents, or men\r\nof fashion, or men of peculiarly engaging manners, find but little\r\ndifficulty in insinuating themselves into what is called good society;\r\nnay, are often among those who are most courted and caressed? Some\r\nvices, I know, are understood to put one under the social ban; but it\r\nis because they offend, not merely against morality and religion, but\r\nagainst taste, against good-breeding, against certain conventions of\r\nthe world. To be convinced of this it is only necessary to observe that\r\nthe same, or even a much larger amount of acknowledged criminality,\r\nmanifested under other forms, is not found to be attended with the\r\nsame result. The mischiefs of this state of things are felt by all;\r\nbut especially by those who are growing up in what are generally\r\naccounted the most favored walks of life. On entering into society\r\nthey see men of known profligacy mingling in the best circles, and\r\nwith the best people, if not indeed on terms of entire sympathy and\r\nconfidence, at least on those of the utmost possible respect and\r\ncourtesy. They see all this, and they see it every day; and it is by\r\nsuch flagrant inconsistencies in those they look up to for guidance,\r\nmore perhaps than by any other one cause, that their own principles and\r\ntheir own faith are undermined. And besides, being thus encouraged and\r\ncountenanced in associating with dissipated and profligate men in what\r\nis called good society, they will be apt to construe it into liberty\r\nto associate with them _anywhere_. At any rate the intimacy is begun.\r\nAs society is constituted at present, corrupting intimacies are not\r\ninfrequently begun amidst all the decencies of life, and, it may be,\r\nin the presence and under the countenance and sanction of parents and\r\nvirtuous friends, which are afterward renewed and consummated, and this\r\ntoo by an easy, natural, and almost necessary gradation, amidst scenes\r\nof excess—perhaps in the haunts of ignominy and crime.\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Sunday, November 18._]\r\n\r\nIf one should propose a reform in this respect, I am aware of the\r\ndifficulties and objections that would stand in his way.\r\n\r\nSome would affirm it to be impracticable in the nature of things.\r\nThey would reason thus: “The circle in which a man visits and moves\r\nis made for him, and not by him: at any rate, it is not, and can not\r\nbe, determined by moral considerations alone. Something depends on\r\neducation; something on family connections or mere vicinity; something\r\non similarity in tastes and pursuits; something also on equality or\r\napproximation in wealth and standing. A poor man, or a man having a\r\nbare competency, if he is as virtuous and industrious, is just as\r\n_respectable_ as a rich man; but it is plain that he can not pitch his\r\nstyle of living, or his style of hospitality, on the same scale of\r\nexpense. It is better for both, therefore, that they should visit in\r\ndifferent circles.” Perhaps it is; but what then? I am not recommending\r\nan amalgamation of the different classes in society. I suppose that\r\nsuch an amalgamation would neither be practicable nor desirable in\r\nthe existing state of things. All I contend for is, that in every\r\nclass, open and gross immorality of any kind should exclude a man from\r\nreputable company. Will any one say that this is impracticable? Let\r\na man, through untoward events, but not by any fault or neglect of\r\nhis own, be reduced in his circumstances,—let a man become generally\r\nodious, not in consequence of any immorality, but because, perhaps,\r\nhe has embraced the unpopular side in politics or religion—let a man\r\nomit some trifling formality which is construed into a vulgarity, or\r\na personal affront, and people do not appear to find much difficulty\r\nin dropping the acquaintance. If, then, it is so easy a thing to drop\r\na man’s acquaintance for other reasons, and for no reason,—from mere\r\nprejudice, from mere caprice,—will it still be pretended that it can\r\nnot be done at the command of duty and religion?\r\n\r\nAgain, it may be objected that, if you banish a man from general\r\nsociety for his immoralities, you will drive him to despair, and so\r\ndestroy the only remaining hope of his reformation. What! are you going\r\n_to keep society corrupt_ in the vain expectation that a corrupt state\r\nof society will help to reform its corrupt members? Besides, I grant\r\nthat we should have compassion on the guilty; but I also hold that we\r\nshould have compassion on the innocent too. Would you, therefore, allow\r\na bad man to continue in good society, when the chances are a thousand\r\nto one that he will make others as bad as himself, and not more than\r\none to a thousand that he himself will be reclaimed? Moreover, this\r\nreasoning is fallacious throughout. By expelling a dissipated and\r\nprofligate man from good society, instead of destroying all hope of\r\nhis recovery, you do in fact resort to the only remaining means of\r\nreforming one over whom a fear of God, and a sense of character, and\r\nthe upbraidings of conscience have lost their power. What cares he for\r\nprinciple, or God, or an hereafter? Nothing, therefore, is so likely to\r\nencourage and embolden him to go on in his guilty course, as the belief\r\nthat he will be allowed to do so without the forfeiture of the only\r\nthing he does care for, his reputable standing in the world. On the\r\nother hand, nothing is so likely to arrest him in these courses, and\r\nbring him to serious reflection, as the stern and determined threat of\r\nabsolute exclusion from good society, if he persists.\r\n\r\nAnother objection will also be made which has stronger claims on our\r\nsympathy and respect. We shall be told that the innocent as well as\r\nthe guilty will suffer—the guilty man’s friends and connections,\r\nwho will probably feel the indignity more than he does himself. God\r\nforbid that we should needlessly add to the pain of those who are thus\r\nconnected! But we must remember that the highest form of friendship\r\ndoes not consist in blindly falling in with the feelings of those whom\r\nwe would serve, but in consulting what will be for their real and\r\npermanent good. If, therefore, the course here recommended has been\r\nshown to be not only indispensable to public morals, but more likely\r\nthan any other to reclaim the offender, it is clearly not more a\r\ndictate of justice to the community, than of Christian charity to the\r\nparties more immediately concerned. Consider, also, how much is asked,\r\nwhen a good man is called upon to open his doors to persons without\r\nvirtue and without principle. Unless the social circle is presided\r\nover by a spirit which will rebuke and frown away immorality, whatever\r\nfashionable names and disguises it may wear,—unless your sons and\r\ndaughters can meet together without being in danger of having their\r\nfaith disturbed by the jeers of the infidel, or their purity sullied\r\nby the breath of the libertine, neither they nor you are safe in the\r\nmost innocent enjoyments and recreations. Parents at least should take\r\na deep interest in this subject, if they do not wish to see the virtue,\r\nwhich they have reared under the best domestic discipline, blighted and\r\ncorrupted before their eyes by the temptations to which their children\r\nare almost necessarily exposed in general society—a society which they\r\ncan not escape except by going out of the world, and which they can not\r\npartake of without endangering the loss of what is of more value than a\r\nthousand worlds.\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Sunday, November 25._]\r\n\r\nI have failed altogether in my purpose in this discourse if I have\r\nnot done something to increase your distrust of mere companionable\r\nqualities, when not under the control of moral and religious principle;\r\nand also of the moral character and moral influence of general society,\r\nas at present constituted. Still you may ask, “If I associate with\r\npersons worse than myself, how can it be made out to be more probable\r\nthat they will drag me down to their level, than that I shall lift\r\nthem up to mine?” The answer to this question, I hardly need say,\r\ndepends, in no small measure, on the reason or motive which induces the\r\nassociation. If you mix with the world, not for purposes of pleasure or\r\nself-advantage—if you resort to society, not for society as an end, but\r\nas a means to a higher end, _the improvement of society itself_—you do\r\nbut take up the heavenly mission which Christ began. For not being able\r\nto make the distinction, through the hollowness and corruption of their\r\nhearts, the Pharisees thought it to be a just ground of accusation\r\nagainst our Lord, that he was willing to be accounted the friend of\r\npublicans and sinners. Let the same mind be in you that was also in\r\nChrist Jesus, and we can not doubt that the spirit which inspires you\r\nwill preserve you wherever you may go. It is of such persons that our\r\nLord has said: “Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and\r\nscorpions, and over all the power of the enemy; and nothing shall by\r\nany means harm you.” Very far am I, therefore, from denying that we may\r\ndo good in society, as well as incur danger and evil. Even in common\r\nfriendships frequent occasions will present themselves for mutual\r\nservice, for mutual counsel and admonition. Let me impress upon you\r\nthis duty. Perhaps there is not one among you all, who has not at this\r\nmoment companions on whom he can confer an infinite blessing. If there\r\nis a weak place in their characters, if to your knowledge they are\r\ncontemplating a guilty purpose, if they are on the brink of entering\r\ninto dangerous connections, by a timely, affectionate, and earnest\r\nremonstrance you may save them from ruin. _Remember, we shall all be\r\nheld responsible, not only for the evil which we do ourselves, but for\r\nthe evil which we might prevent others from doing; it is not enough\r\nthat we stand; we must endeavor to hold up our friends._\r\n\r\nVery different from this, however, is the ordinary commerce of society;\r\nand hence its danger. If we mix with the world for the pleasure it\r\naffords, we shall be likely to be among the first to be reconciled to\r\nthe freedom and laxity it allows. The world is not brought up to us,\r\nbut we sink down to the world; the drop becomes of the consistence\r\nand color of the ocean into which it falls; the ocean remains itself\r\nunchanged. In the words of an old writer: “Though the well-disposed\r\nwill remain some good space without corruption, yet time, I know not\r\nhow, worketh a wound in him, which weakness of ours considered, and\r\neasiness of nature, apt to be deceived, looked into, they do best\r\nprovide for themselves that separate themselves as far as they can\r\nfrom the bad, and draw as nigh to the good, as by any possibility they\r\ncan attain to.” “He that walketh with wise men shall be wise; but a\r\ncompanion of fools shall be destroyed.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL ECONOMY.\r\n\r\nBy G. M. STEELE, D.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION, CONTINUED—CAPITAL—COMBINATION AND DIVISION OF LABOR.\r\n\r\n5. We have already seen that an essential to any considerable\r\nproduction is _capital_. We have seen the nature of capital and how\r\nit comes to exist. We have also learned that though capital implies\r\nsaving, mere saving is not the sole condition of capital; indeed, a\r\nnarrow penuriousness prevents the rapid accumulation of capital. The\r\nman who is accustomed to bring his water from a spring a quarter of\r\na mile from his house instead of digging a well at the cost of a few\r\ndollars, or a few days’ work, acts uneconomically. In the long run\r\nthe bringing of the water from the spring costs him much more than\r\nthe digging of the well. The man who has extensive grain-fields, and\r\nwho, for the sake of saving the expense of a reaper, or even a cradle,\r\ncontinues to use the sickle, will find that his saving results in a\r\nloss instead of a gain.\r\n\r\nA man does not need to be rich in order to be a capitalist. When the\r\nsavage has invented a bow and arrows he has the rudiments of capital.\r\nThe laborer who has reserved out of his earnings enough to buy him a\r\nset of tools, or a few acres of land, is as really a capitalist as\r\nthe owner of factories or railroads. Whatever property is used for\r\nproduction is capital.\r\n\r\nCapital exists in many forms. It has been generally divided into\r\n_fixed_ and _circulating_, though the limits of these divisions are\r\nnot very precisely defined. The main difference consists in this, that\r\nwhile certain kinds of capital are used only once in the fulfillment of\r\ntheir purposes, other kinds are used repeatedly. Fuel can be burned but\r\nonce. An axe may serve for years. Circulating capital is of two kinds:\r\n\r\n(1) There are the stock and commodities which are to be consumed in\r\nreproduction; (_a_) the material out of which the new product is to be\r\nmade, as lumber for cabinet ware, leather for shoes, etc.; (_b_) food\r\nand other provisions for the sustenance of the laborers.\r\n\r\n(2) There is the stock of completed commodities on hand and ready\r\nfor the market. The chairs that are finished and ready for sale in\r\nthe chair factory are of this character. It is to be observed that\r\nthe same article may be at one time circulating and at another fixed\r\ncapital. Thus the chairs just spoken of, while they are in the hands\r\nof the manufacturer, or passing through those of the dealers, are\r\ncirculating capital. It is only when they become _fixed in use_ that\r\ntheir character changes.\r\n\r\nFixed capital consists (1) of all tools, implements, and machinery,\r\nused in the trades. Here, too, belong all structures of every sort\r\nfor productive purposes; (2) all beasts of burden and draft; (3)\r\nall improvements of land implied in clearing, fencing, draining,\r\nfertilizing, terracing, etc.; (4) all mental acquisitions gained by\r\nlabor and which give man power for productive results.\r\n\r\nObviously capital, by whomsoever owned, is an advantage to the laborer.\r\nBut such capital is useless to the owner unless he can unite it with\r\nlabor. So, too, the ability to labor is of no benefit to the laborer\r\nunless he can employ it in connection with capital. Generally the more\r\ncapital there is in a community, other things being equal, the better\r\nit is for the laborer; and the more laborers there are, other things\r\nbeing equal, the better it is for the capitalist. When a factory burns\r\ndown it may destroy only a small part of the wealth of the owners, and\r\nthey may not palpably suffer; but it is very likely to deprive the\r\nlaborers, who are connected with it, of the means of securing their\r\ndaily sustenance.\r\n\r\nThere is no natural antagonism of interests between capital and labor,\r\nbut rather the utmost concord and interdependence. Whatever conflicts\r\narise between the laborers and the capitalists come from the unnatural\r\nselfishness and jealousy of the parties concerned.\r\n\r\n6. As has been intimated, it is only by application of principles\r\nunderlying political economy that we come to the conditions of the\r\nhighest production, or, in other words, find how to satisfy the largest\r\nrange of desires to the greatest extent at the smallest cost of labor.\r\nOne of the chief means of effecting this is by _the combination and\r\ndivision of labor_. Recalling what was said concerning association and\r\nindividuality, we shall see what principles are involved here, and\r\nhow naturally they came into operation. As there was seen to be no\r\nantagonism between the two latter conceptions when carefully analyzed,\r\nso there is none, but rather the opposite, between combination\r\nand division of labor. It is true that there are instances where\r\ncombination may take place without division, as when men unite to\r\neffect purposes which one could not accomplish except in much more than\r\nthe proportionate time; as also in some cases to affect purposes which\r\nthe individual could not effect in any length of time, such as the\r\nmoving and placing of heavy timbers and stones, the management of ships\r\nand railway trains, etc. But for the most part men divide their labor\r\nin the process in order that they may combine the result. This is done\r\nin two ways:\r\n\r\n(1) Men divide up the work of supplying human wants into different\r\ntrades and occupations, according to their several tastes and\r\naptitudes. Each man needs nearly the same that every other needs.\r\nBut while each provides for only one kind of want, he provides more\r\nthan enough to satisfy his own desire in that particular respect,\r\nand contributes the overplus to meet that same want in others. As\r\nall others do the same, each is contributing to meet the desires\r\nof one and all to each. The shoemaker, the tailor, the carpenter,\r\nthe cabinet-maker, the blacksmith, the weaver, the paper-maker, the\r\ntin-man, the miner, the smelter, the painter, the glazier, etc., are\r\nall contributing to supply the farmer’s needs, and the farmer is\r\ncontributing to all their needs. The wants of all are many times more\r\nfully met in this way than if each one should undertake to supply all\r\nhis own wants.\r\n\r\n(2) In some complicated trades the work is divided into a number of\r\nprocesses. There are men who could do every one of these parts; but\r\nsuch men are few, and their labor very costly, because some of the\r\nparts require rare skill and talent. What is needed is to organize\r\nseveral grades of laborers, so that the physically strong, the\r\nintelligent and skillful may have the work that only they can do; the\r\nless strong and skillful may find employment in the lighter and easier\r\nparts, and so all grades of ability down to the delicate woman or the\r\nlittle child, and up to the most powerful muscle and most advanced\r\nintelligence, can find their place. It is almost incredible how great\r\nis the increase of productiveness from the mere economical arrangement\r\nof workers. It is said that in so simple a matter as the making of\r\npins, where the work is divided into ten processes and properly\r\ndistributed, that the production will be _two hundred and forty times_\r\nas much as if each man did the whole work on each pin.\r\n\r\nThis connects itself with another important condition of large\r\nproduction. I mean the diversification of employment in a community.\r\nIt is only in such a varied industry that all the varied tastes,\r\naptitudes and abilities of society can find scope and adaptation; and\r\nwithout this, production must fall far short of its possibilities.\r\nThis, too, is required to develop those differences which constitute\r\nindividuality, and on which association depends.\r\n\r\nThere are other conditions of enlarged production, such as are implied\r\nin freedom, good government, and the moral character of the community,\r\nthe influence of each of which will easily suggest itself to thoughtful\r\nminds.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.—CONSUMPTION.\r\n\r\n1. Consumption is the destruction of values. Production implies\r\nconsumption. In general, all material is destroyed in entering into\r\nnew forms of wealth. Thus, leather must be destroyed in order to the\r\nproduction of shoes. Flour must disappear in the manufacture of bread,\r\nand wheat in the making of flour. Every kind of implement, or machine\r\nor structure is consumed by use. This consumption is immediate, or\r\nby a single use; or it is gradual. The food that we eat and the fuel\r\nthat we burn are examples of the former; tools, bridges, buildings\r\nand aqueducts are examples of the latter. It is accomplished in a few\r\nmonths or years; or is protracted through centuries.\r\n\r\n2. Consumption is either _voluntary_ or _involuntary_. Of the latter\r\nkind we have instances in the _natural decay_ of objects, as in wood\r\nand vegetables; the rusting of iron, the mildew and the moth-eating of\r\ncotton and woolen fabrics, and the wearing away by attrition of gold,\r\nsilver, and other metals; also the destruction caused by vermin. Much\r\nof this may be prevented by the prudent foresight which sound economy\r\nenjoins; yet much loss will inevitably take place. A great deal of\r\nconsumption is _accidental_. Great destruction is caused by fires,\r\nsteam-boiler explosions, floods and tornadoes, earthquakes and volcanic\r\neruptions.\r\n\r\n3. Voluntary consumption is either _productive_ or _unproductive_.\r\nThe former is when the material appears in new form and with a higher\r\nvalue, as cloth made into garments and iron into hardware and cutlery.\r\nUnproductive consumption occurs, both in the cases before mentioned of\r\nnatural and accidental consumption, and in cases where gratification\r\nof desire is the sole object sought and achieved, as when one eats and\r\ndrinks simply for the enjoyment, and without reference to the waste of\r\nnature or the nourishment of the system.\r\n\r\nIt is not altogether easy to discriminate between these two kinds of\r\nconsumption. We readily see the difference between a man’s drinking a\r\nquantity of whiskey, not because it will help him in the performance\r\nof any duty, but because he likes it, and the scattering of a quantity\r\nof seed over the ground in spring. There is no doubt that one act is\r\nproductive and the other unproductive. But there are cases where the\r\ndistinction is less clear.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessarily a case of unproductive consumption when one\r\ndestroys value for the sake of gratifying some desire. Probably a\r\nmajority of men eat and drink simply because they desire food and\r\ndrink, having no thought of any ulterior object. Yet this eating and\r\ndrinking is absolutely essential to productive labor. The wealth\r\nconsumed in this way reappears, to a large extent, in the products of\r\nhuman industry.\r\n\r\nStill there is much really unproductive consumption; a destruction of\r\nvalue, in the place of which no other value ever appears. There are,\r\nfor instance, men and women—\r\n\r\n    *     *     *       “who creep\r\n    Into this world to eat and sleep,\r\n    And know no reason why they’re born,\r\n    But simply to consume the corn.”\r\n\r\nVast quantities of wealth are consumed in riotous living, in greedy\r\nand vulgar extravagance, and unmeaning magnificence. There is also\r\nmuch consumption designed to be productive, but failing of its\r\nend through misdirection. Large amounts of property are sometimes\r\ninvested in enterprises which prove failures. This occurs partly from\r\nmiscalculation or negligence, and partly from a disposition to trust\r\nto chances—the gambler’s calculation. In these ways much wealth is\r\nconsumed with no consequent product.\r\n\r\n4. It is not easy to draw the line between the ordinary conveniences of\r\nlife and its luxuries; nor can it be stated to what extent the latter\r\nin any sense of the term are economically allowable. What to one class\r\nof persons may be a luxury to another class may be almost a necessity.\r\nSo what might in one age have been a rare and expensive indulgence,\r\nis in a more advanced period among the cheaper and more ordinary\r\ncommodities. I call special attention to three kinds of consumption:\r\n\r\n(1) There is the consumption necessary to life and the performance of\r\nproductive labor. The word _necessary_ here is used in its liberal\r\nrather than its restricted sense. The absolute necessities of human\r\nlife are very few. It does not even require much to keep a man in\r\nworking condition. But to keep him where there is a larger kind of\r\nliving, and where his energies of both body and mind, together with the\r\nmoral qualities which render him most efficient, are at their best, the\r\nconsumption must be more generous.\r\n\r\nBesides subsistence there must be materials, tools, machines, and\r\na variety of conditions involving the destruction of value. It is\r\ndesirable to sustain man not as a mere savage, but to give him the\r\nlargest volume of human life; and the civilized man, it will be\r\nadmitted, lives a broader life than the savage. We are not to forget\r\nthat Political Economy aims at the increase of the value of man, more\r\nthan at the multiplication of material wealth, or the increase of\r\ncommerce, except as the latter are conditions of the former.\r\n\r\n(2) A second kind of consumption is of such articles as minister\r\nto bodily enjoyment and meet certain mental appetencies of a lower\r\norder. They are not necessary to sustain life, nor to render it more\r\nefficient. On the contrary, they often impair the vigor and competence\r\nof the person. At the best they simply gratify certain desires without\r\nadding anything to the value of the man. To this category belong mere\r\ndainty food, gold and jewels, and other ornaments, valued solely\r\nbecause of their showiness and not for any artistic excellence; gay and\r\ncostly apparel, in which the gayety and the costliness are the main\r\nfeatures. These constitute a class of luxuries that are in nearly every\r\nsense non-productive. They favorably affect neither the individual nor\r\nsociety, and are for the most part hurtful to both.\r\n\r\n(3) But not all consumption, the object of which is to gratify desire,\r\nis to be reckoned in this category. There are certain pleasures which\r\nennoble and really enrich those who participate in them. There are\r\ndesires the gratification of which enlarges the volume of one’s being.\r\nThey are related not so much to man’s productive capability as to that\r\nwhich is the final cause of all production, and to which all wealth\r\nis only a means. The labor, material, implements, and whatever else\r\nis consumed in the production of the works or effects of genuine art,\r\nresult in the most _real wealth_ that exists. By this is meant not\r\nmerely pictures, statues, books, carved work, tasteful tapestries,\r\nand similar objects which can be bought and sold, but also oratorios\r\nwhich you may hear but once; magnificent parks to which you may be\r\nadmitted, but may never own; great actors and singers whose genius may\r\nbe exhibited to others, but not possessed by them. It is true that much\r\nwhich properly belongs here may be so consumed as to deserve only a\r\nplace in the second class; but it may also have those higher and nobler\r\nuses which imply production in the best sense.\r\n\r\n5. _Public consumption_ is the expenditure of means for society in its\r\naggregate capacity. It has reference principally to the support of\r\nthose agencies which are implied in the term _government_. The reasons\r\nfor the necessity of such expenditures have already been given. The\r\npurposes to which such consumption is properly applied may be grouped\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n(_a_) The support and administration of government. This embraces\r\ncompensation to executive, legislative and judicial officers,\r\nand expenditure for public buildings. (_b_) For works of public\r\nconvenience. Here are included the paving and lighting of streets,\r\nwater-works and sewerage. (_c_) For advancing science and promoting\r\nintelligence, by means of exploring expeditions, geological surveys,\r\nmeteorological and astronomical observations, etc. (_d_) For the\r\npromotion of popular education. (_e_) For the support of the poor and\r\nthe relief of the afflicted. (_f_) For national defense.\r\n\r\n6. The general law of economical consumption, both individual and\r\npublic, is that only so much and such a quality should be consumed as\r\nis necessary to effect the purpose designed, whether that be further\r\nproduction or individual gratification. It is nearly the same in the\r\ncase of labor. In relation to the work to be done, the character,\r\nability and skill of the laborer should be considered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREADINGS IN ART.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.—SCULPTURE: GRECIAN AND ROMAN.\r\n\r\nWhile Egyptian sculpture was losing its individuality, and Assyrian\r\nwas wearing itself out in excessive ornamentation, there was a new art\r\ngrowing up in the isles and on the eastern shores of the Mediterranean.\r\nThe early centuries of its growth are hidden from our knowledge. The\r\nremains are so scanty, so imperfect, that it is with difficulty that\r\nwe trace the influences which were molding the art, and the extent to\r\nwhich it was taking hold of the people. Of this primitive period but\r\none single work of sculpture is preserved.\r\n\r\n“At Mycenæ, once perhaps in the days of Homer (850-800? B. C.) the most\r\nimportant city of Greece, there are sculptural works in the remains\r\nof two lions over the entrance gate. The height of these is about ten\r\nfeet, and the width fifteen feet. The stone is a greenish limestone.\r\nThe holes show where the metal pins held the heads, long since decayed.\r\nFragments as they are, they show an Assyrian rather than an Egyptian\r\ninfluence in the strong marking of the muscles and joints, softened\r\nthough it is by decay, and in the erect attitude, which denotes action,\r\nsuch as is not seen in Egyptian art of this kind. Of this gate of the\r\nlions, which has long been known as the most ancient work of early\r\nGreek sculpture, it must be noticed that it is not in the round, but\r\nonly in high relief. And this is the case with all the earliest works,\r\njust as it is with the Assyrian sculptures. They tend to show therefore\r\nthat the Greek sculptor had not yet learnt to model and carve in the\r\nround in marble and stone.”\r\n\r\nIn the objects found by Cesnola in Cyprus, and consisting of statues\r\nand other sculptures, incised gems, and metal work of the hammered-out\r\nkind, the resemblance to the art of Assyria is remarkable. Three\r\nhundred years later than the “gate of lions” are the reliefs discovered\r\nat Xanthus in Lycia. “They belong to the Harpy monument—a pier-shaped\r\nmemorial, along the upper edge of which is a frieze ornamented in\r\nrelief.” The archaic is still visible in the figures. The drapery\r\nfalls in long straight folds, with zigzag edges. There is the stiff,\r\ninevitable smile of the Egyptian statue. The figures are in motion, but\r\nboth feet are set flat on the ground. Though in profile the eyes are\r\nshown in full. In spite of these primitive absurdities, and the fact\r\nthat the subjects represent foreign myths, the statues are Greek.\r\n\r\nIn the fifth century various art schools were founded. “In Argos lived\r\nArgeladas (515-455 B. C.), famous for his bronze statues of gods and\r\nOlympic victors, and still more famous for his three great pupils,\r\nPhidias, Myron, and Polycleitus. In Sicyon there lived, at the same\r\ntime, Canachus, the founder of a vital and enduring school. He executed\r\nthe colossal statue of Apollo at Miletus, and was skilled not only\r\nin casting bronze but in the use of gold and ivory and wood carving.\r\nÆgina, then a commercial island as yet not subjected, was rendered\r\nillustrious by the two masters Callon and Onatas, the latter especially\r\nknown by several groups of bronze statues and warlike scenes from\r\nheroic legends. Lastly, Athens possessed among other artists Hegias,\r\nthe teacher of Phidias and Critius. But all of these old masters were\r\nsevere, hard, archaic in their treatment.”\r\n\r\nBut a period approaches when by a freer, happier treatment of their\r\nwork the way was led to the highest Athenian sculpture. We can but\r\nmention the leading sculptors, Calamis of Athens, Pythagoras of\r\nRhegium, and, greatest of all, Myron of Athens. They do not belong\r\nto the epoch of the finest Grecian art, but they were the immediate\r\nforerunners.\r\n\r\n“Now, for the first time in opposition to the barbarians, the\r\nnational Hellenic mind rose to the highest consciousness of noble\r\nindependence and dignity. Athens concentrated within herself, as in\r\na focus, the whole exuberance and many-sidedness of Greek life, and\r\nglorified it into beautiful utility. The victory of the old time\r\nover the new was effected by the power of Phidias, one of the most\r\nwonderful artist minds of all times. He lived in the times of Athens’\r\ngreatest prosperity, and to him Pericles gave the task of executing\r\nthe magnificent works he had planned for adorning the city. Among\r\nthe famous statues which Phidias wrought in carrying out these plans\r\nwas that of Athene, the patron goddess of the Athenians. The booty\r\nwhich had been taken at Salamis was set aside for this purpose, and\r\nforty-four talents, equal to $589,875 of our money, was spent in\r\nadorning the statue. The virgin goddess was standing erect; a golden\r\nhelmet covered her beautiful and earnest head; a coat of mail, with\r\nthe head of the Medusa carved in ivory concealed her bosom; and long,\r\nflowing, golden drapery enveloped her whole figure—a statue of Niké,\r\nsix feet high, stood on the outstretched hand of the goddess. The\r\nundraped parts were formed of ivory; the eyes of sparkling precious\r\nstones; the drapery, hair, and weapons of gold. In it Phidias portrayed\r\nfor all ages the character of Minerva, the serious goddess of wisdom,\r\nthe mild protectress of Attica.”\r\n\r\nStill more than in this statue the austere maidenliness of the goddess\r\nwas elevated into noble, intellectual beauty in a figure of Athene\r\nplaced on the Acropolis by the Lemnians; so much so that an old epigram\r\ninstituted a comparison with the Aphrodite of Praxiteles of Cnidus, and\r\ncalls Paris “a mere cow-driver for not giving the apple to Athene.”\r\n\r\nThe still more famous colossal statue by Phidias, the Zeus at Olympia\r\nin Elis, was his last great work. It was made between B. C. 438, the\r\ndate of the consecration of the Parthenon statue, and B. C. 432, the\r\nyear of his death, at Elis.\r\n\r\nThis was a seated statue of ivory and gold, 55 feet high, including\r\nthe throne. Strabo remarks, that “if the god had risen he would have\r\ncarried away the roof,” and the height of the interior was about 55\r\nfeet; the temple being built on the model of the Parthenon at Athens,\r\nwhich was 64 feet to the point of the pediment.\r\n\r\nThe statue was seen in its temple by Paulus Æmilius in the second\r\ncentury B. C., who declared the god himself seemed present to him.\r\nEpictetus says that “it was considered a misfortune for any one to\r\ndie without having seen the masterpiece of Phidias.” In the time of\r\nJulian the Apostate (A. D. 361-363) “it continued to receive the homage\r\nof Greece in spite of every kind of attack which the covert zeal of\r\nConstantine had made against polytheism, its temples, and its idols.”\r\nThis is the last notice we possess giving authentic information of this\r\ngrand statue. Phidias is said to have executed many other statues:\r\nthirteen in bronze from the booty of Marathon, consecrated at Delphi\r\nunder Cimon—statues of Apollo, Athene, and Miltiades, with those ten\r\nheroes who had given their names to the ten Athenian tribes (Eponymi);\r\nan Athene for the city of Pellene in gold and ivory; another for the\r\nPlatæans, of the spoils of Marathon, made of wood gilt, with the head,\r\nfeet, and hands of Pentelic marble. “These,” M. Rochette says, “may be\r\nconsidered the productions of his youth.”\r\n\r\nThe great national work of the time, however, was the Parthenon, and\r\nthe ornamentation was entrusted to Phidias. Not that all the wonderful\r\nstatues were executed by him alone. He had his pupils and associates.\r\nThe most famous of these seems to have been Alcamenes, a versatile and\r\nimaginative disciple of his master. After him were Agoracritus and\r\nPæonius. There were many others who assisted in the work. The outside\r\nof the temple was ornamented with three classes of sculpture: (1) The\r\nsculptures of the pediments, being independent statues resting on the\r\ncornices. (2) The groups of the metopes, ninety-two in number. These\r\nwere in high relief. (3) The frieze around the upper border of the\r\ncella of the Parthenon contained a representation in low relief of the\r\nPanathenaic procession. All these classes of sculpture were in the\r\nhighest style of the art.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the sculptures of the Parthenon is seen in many\r\ndirections in the temple of Apollo at Phigalia, the temple of\r\nNiké-Apteros on the Acropolis at Athens, at Halicarnassus, etc.\r\n\r\n“The works which are known to have been executed by the sculptors\r\ncontemporary with Phidias, and by others who formed what is spoken of\r\nas ‘the later Athenian school,’ did not approach the great examples of\r\nthe Parthenon. Sculpture then reached the highest point in the grandest\r\nstyle, whether in the treatment of the statue in the round, or of\r\nbas-relief as in the frieze, or alto-relievo as in the metopes. As to\r\nthe chryselephantine statues of Phidias, it may be concluded without\r\nhesitation that though we are compelled to rely upon descriptions only,\r\nthey must have been works of the great master even more beautiful than\r\nthe marbles.”\r\n\r\nAt Argos during the time of Phidias, a somewhat younger school\r\nflourished under the leadership of Polycleitus. “The aspiration of\r\nPolycleitus was to depict the perfect beauty of the human form in calm\r\nrepose.” His Amazon and Juno represent best his style; so perfect are\r\nall his works in their proportions that the invention of the canon has\r\nbeen assigned to him.\r\n\r\nIn the works of the later Athenian school, at the head of which were\r\nScopas and Praxiteles, the sublime ideal of Greek art was no longer\r\nsustained by any new creations that can be compared with those of\r\nthe Phidian school; no rivalry with those great masters seemed to\r\nbe attempted. The severe and grand was beyond the comprehension, or\r\nprobably uncongenial to the spirit of the age, which inclined toward\r\nthe poetic, the graceful, the sentimental and romantic. The whole range\r\nof the beautiful myths found abundant illustration in forms entirely\r\ndifferent from the ancient archaic representations, and in these the\r\nfancy of the sculptor was allowed the fullest and freest indulgence.\r\nNymphs, nereids, mænads, and bacchantes occupied the chisel of the\r\nsculptor in every form of graceful beauty.\r\n\r\nAfter this epoch, to which so many of the fine statues\r\nbelong—repetitions in marble of famous originals in bronze—Greek\r\nsculpture took another phase in accordance with the social life and\r\nthe taste of the age, which inclined toward the feeling for display\r\nthat arose with the domination of the Macedonian power, brought to its\r\nheight by the conquests and ambition of Alexander the Great. Lysippus,\r\na self-taught sculptor of Sicyon, was the leading artist of his time.\r\nHe was evidently a student of nature and individual character, as he\r\nwas the first to become celebrated for his portraits, especially those\r\nof Alexander. He departed from the severe and grand style, and in the\r\nnative conceit of all self-taught men sneered at the art of Polycleitus\r\nin the well-known saying recorded of him, “Polycleitus made men as they\r\nwere, but I make them as they ought to be.” He seems to have been the\r\nfirst great naturalistic sculptor.\r\n\r\nRhodes had unquestionable right to give her name to a school of\r\nsculpture, both from the great antiquity of the origin of the culture\r\nof the arts in the island, and from the number, more than one hundred,\r\nof colossal statues in bronze. The Rhodian school is also distinguished\r\nby those remarkable examples of sculpture in marble of large groups\r\nof figures—the Toro Farnese and the Laocoon. In these works there is\r\nthe same feeling for display of artistic accomplishment that has been\r\nnoticed as characteristic of the Macedonian age, with that effort at\r\nthe pathetic, especially in the Laocoon, which belongs to the finer\r\nstyle of the later Athenian school as displayed in the works of Scopas\r\nand Praxiteles, in the Niobe figures and others.\r\n\r\nAt Pergamus, another school allied in style to that of Ephesus arose,\r\nof which the chief sculptor was Pyromachus, who, according to Pliny,\r\nflourished in the 120th Olympiad, B. C. 300-298. A statue of Æsculapius\r\nby Pyromachus was a work of some note in the splendid temple at\r\nPergamus, and is to be seen on the coins of that city. It is also\r\nconjectured that the well-known Dying Gladiator is a copy of a bronze\r\nby Pyromachus. The vigorous naturalistic style of these statues,\r\nsurpassing anything of preceding schools in the effort at expression,\r\nmay be taken as characteristic of the school of Pergamus, then\r\ncompletely under Roman influence, and destined to become more so. But\r\nall question as to the nature of the sculptures was set at rest by the\r\ndiscovery of many large works in high relief by the German expedition\r\nat Pergamus in 1875. These are now in the Museum at Berlin. They are\r\nof almost colossal proportions, representing, as Pliny described, the\r\nwars of Attalus and the Battles with the Giants. The nude figure is\r\nespecially marked by the effort to display artistic ability as well\r\nas great energy in the action. In these points there is observable a\r\nconnection with the well-known and very striking example of sculpture\r\nof this order—the Fighting Gladiator, or more properly the Warrior of\r\nAgasias, who, as is certain from the inscription on his work, was an\r\nEphesian.\r\n\r\nThe equally renowned statue of the Apollo Belvedere, finely conceived\r\nand admirably modeled as it undoubtedly is, bears the stamp of artistic\r\ndisplay which removes it from the style of the great classic works of\r\nsculpture.\r\n\r\nThe history of Roman sculpture is soon told. If it have any real\r\nroots, they are to be traced in the ancient Etruscan; for all that was\r\nreally characteristic in it as art is associated with that style, in\r\nthat intense naturalism which became developed so strikingly in the\r\nproduction of portrait statues and busts, and in those great monumental\r\nworks in bas-relief which are marked by the same strong feeling for\r\ndescriptive representation of the most direct and realistic kind, upon\r\ntheir triumphal columns and arches.\r\n\r\nAs has already been stated, early Roman sculpture, if such it can be\r\ncalled, was entirely the work of Etruscan artists, employed by the\r\nwealth of Rome to afford the citizens that display of pomp in their\r\nworship of the gods and the triumphs of their warriors which their\r\nambition demanded. All important works were made of colossal size. Some\r\nof the early Roman (quasi Etruscan) statues spoken of by the historians\r\nare a bronze colossus of Jupiter, an Etruscan bronze colossus of\r\nApollo, eighty feet high, in the Palatine Library of the temple of\r\nAugustus. A portrait statue of an orator in the toga, and a chimæra,\r\nboth of bronze, are in the Florence Museum. Sculpture, from the love\r\nof it as a means of expressing the beautiful in the ideal form of the\r\ndeities or the heroic and the pathetic of humanity, never existed as\r\na growth of Roman civilization. The inclination of the Roman mind was\r\ntoward social, municipal, and imperial system and ordering; in this\r\ndirection the Romans were inventors and improvers upon that which they\r\nborrowed from the Greeks. But in art they began by hiring, and they\r\nended by debasing the work of the hired.\r\n\r\nThey took away the bronze statues of Greece as trophies of conquest,\r\ncovered them with gold, and set them up in the palaces and public\r\nplaces of Rome. They subsidized the sculptors of Greece, who under\r\nRoman influence had fallen away from their high traditions; they did\r\nnothing for the sake of art, but simply manufactured, as it were,\r\ncopies and imitations of Greek statues for their own use. Happily we\r\nhave to be grateful for the fact, though we can not honor the motive.\r\nHad it not been for this bestowal of their wealth in the gratification\r\nof their taste for luxury and display, many of the renowned statues\r\nof ancient Greek art would have been known only by the vague mention\r\nof them by Pausanias and Pliny, or the early Christian writers of the\r\nChurch, or the poetic allusions of the Greek anthologists and the Latin\r\nepigrammatists.\r\n\r\nThe Column of Trajan was the great work of Apollodorus, the favorite\r\narchitect of the emperor, dedicated A. D. 114. It is 10½ feet in\r\ndiameter and 127 feet high, made of thirty-four blocks of white marble,\r\ntwenty-three being in the shaft, nine in the base, which is finely\r\nsculptured, and two in the capital and _torus_. The reliefs at the base\r\nare smaller than those toward the top, being two feet high, increasing\r\nto nearly four as they approach the summit; this was, of course, to\r\nenable the more distant subjects to be seen equally well with the\r\nothers, a singular illustration of the intensely practical turn of\r\nRoman art in its application. There are about 2,500 figures, not\r\ncounting horses, representing the battles and sieges of the Dacian war.\r\nThe column of M. Aurelius Antoninus, erected A. D. 174, is similar in\r\nheight, but the sculptures, although in higher relief, are not so good.\r\nThey represent the conquest of the Marcomans.\r\n\r\nThe Augustan age (B. C. 36-A. D. 14), favorable as it was to\r\nliterature, only contributed to the multiplying of copies of the Greek\r\nstatues, such as we see in so many instances, some of which are of\r\ngreat excellence, and inestimable as reliable evidence of fine Greek\r\nsculpture. These copies were sometimes varied by the sculptor in some\r\nimmaterial point of detail.\r\n\r\nNero (A. D. 54-68) is said to have adorned his Golden House with no\r\nless than 500 statues, brought from Delphi. In the Baths of Titus,\r\nstill in existence (they were built on the ground of the house and\r\ngardens of Mæcenas), many valuable statues have been discovered. The\r\nArch of Titus furnishes an excellent example of bas-relief of that\r\ntime, in it the golden candlestick and other spoils from the temple of\r\nJerusalem are shown.\r\n\r\nHadrian (A. D. 117-138) encouraged the reproduction of the Greek\r\nstatues, with great success as regards execution, for his famous villa\r\nat Tivoli, and besides these are the statues of his favorite Antinous,\r\nwhich are the most original works of the time. Hadrian’s imperial\r\nand liberal promotion of sculpture, gave an immense impetus to the\r\nproduction of statues of every form. All the towns of Greece which he\r\nfavored made bronze portrait statues of him, which were placed in the\r\ntemple of Jupiter Olympius at Athens, and the enclosure round more than\r\nhalf a mile in extent was filled with its many statues.\r\n\r\nThe learned Varro speaks of Arcesilaus as the sculptor of Venus\r\nGenetrix, in the forum of Cæsar, and of a beautiful marble group of\r\nCupids playing with a lioness, some leading her, others beating her\r\nwith their sandals, others offering her wine to drink from horns.\r\n\r\nUnder the Antonines arose the outrageous fashion of representing noble\r\nRomans and their wives as deities, and this was carried so far that\r\nthe men are not unfrequently nude as if heroic. The bas-reliefs on the\r\narch of Septimus Severus at Rome, and that which goes by the name of\r\nConstantine—though made chiefly of reliefs belonging to one raised in\r\nhonor of Trajan—show the poor condition of sculpture at that time. The\r\nnumerous sarcophagi, some made by Greek sculptors for the Roman market,\r\nand others by those working at Rome, are other examples of the feeble\r\nstyle of imitators and workmen actuated by no knowledge or feeling of\r\nart. Some of these are still to be seen in the collections at Rome,\r\nwith mythological subjects, the heads being left unfinished, so that\r\nthe portraits of the family could be carved when required.\r\n\r\nThe rule of Constantine was, however, far more disastrous to art as the\r\nseat of the Empire was removed to Byzantium. Most of the finest statues\r\naccumulated in Rome were removed there only to be lost forever in the\r\nplundering of wars and the fanatical rage of the Christian iconoclasts.\r\nWhile destroying the statues of the gods, they may have spared those\r\nwhich commemorated agonistic victors; but we may be sure that nearly\r\nall the works in metal which the Christians spared were melted down by\r\nthe barbarous hordes of Gothic invaders, who under Alaric occupied the\r\nMorea about A. D. 395.\r\n\r\nWith this glance at the complete decadence of art and the coming\r\ndarkness that preceded its revival, we approach the subject of\r\nsculpture as connected with the rise of ecclesiastical religious art,\r\nwhich is necessarily reserved for further consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSELECTIONS FROM AMERICAN LITERATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nBENJAMIN FRANKLIN.\r\n\r\n    I recommend the study of Franklin to all young people;\r\n    he was a real philanthropist, a wonderful man.

But the quantity of ice made that night impeded\r\nthe passage of the boats so much that it was three o’clock before the\r\nartillery could all be got over; and near four before the troops took\r\nup their line of march.\r\n\r\nThis made me despair of surprising the town, as I well knew we could\r\nnot reach it before the day was fairly broke. But as I was certain\r\nthere was no making a retreat without being discovered, and harassed on\r\nre-passing the river, I determined to push on at all events. I formed\r\nmy detachment into two divisions, one to march by the lower or river\r\nroad, the other by the upper or Pennington road. As the divisions had\r\nnearly the same distance to march, I ordered each of them, immediately\r\nupon forcing the out-guards, to push directly into the town, that they\r\nmight charge the enemy before they had time to form.\r\n\r\nThe upper division arrived at the enemy’s advanced post exactly at\r\neight o’clock: and in three minutes after I found, from the fire on the\r\nlower road, that that division had also got up. The out-guards made but\r\nsmall opposition, though, for their numbers, they behaved very well,\r\nkeeping up a constant retreating fire from behind houses. We presently\r\nsaw their main body formed; but from their motions, they seemed\r\nundetermined how to act.\r\n\r\nBeing hard pressed by our troops, who had already got possession of\r\ntheir artillery, they attempted to file off by a road on their right,\r\nleading to Princeton. But, perceiving their intention, I threw a body\r\nof troops in their way; which immediately checked them. Finding,\r\nfrom our disposition, that they were surrounded, and that they must\r\ninevitably be cut to pieces if they made any further resistance, they\r\nagreed to lay down their arms. The number that submitted in this manner\r\nwas twenty-three officers and eight hundred and eighty-six men. Colonel\r\nRahl, the commanding officer, and seven others, were found wounded in\r\nthe town. I do not exactly know how many they had killed; but I fancy\r\nnot above twenty or thirty, as they never made any regular stand. Our\r\nloss is very trifling indeed—only two officers and one or two privates\r\nwounded.\r\n\r\nI find that the detachment consisted of the three Hessian regiments of\r\nLanspach, Kniphausen, and Rahl, amounting to about fifteen hundred men,\r\nand a troop of British light horse; but immediately upon the beginning\r\nof the attack, all those who were not killed or taken pushed directly\r\ndown toward Bordentown. These would likewise have fallen into our hands\r\ncould my plan have been completely carried into execution.\r\n\r\nGeneral Ewing was to have crossed before day at Trenton ferry, and\r\ntaken possession of the bridge leading out of town; but the quantity\r\nof ice was so great that, though he did every thing in his power to\r\neffect it, he could not get over. This difficulty also hindered General\r\nCadwallader from crossing with the Pennsylvania militia from Bristol.\r\nHe got part of his foot over; but finding it impossible to embark his\r\nartillery, he was obliged to desist.\r\n\r\nI am fully confident that, could the troops under Generals Ewing and\r\nCadwallader have passed the river, I should have been able, with their\r\nassistance, to have driven the enemy from all their posts below\r\nTrenton. But the numbers I had with me being inferior to theirs below\r\nme, and a strong battalion of light infantry being at Princeton above\r\nme, I thought it most prudent to return the same evening with the\r\nprisoners and the artillery we had taken. We found no stores of any\r\nconsequence in the town.\r\n\r\nIn justice to the officers and men, I must add that their behavior upon\r\nthis occasion reflects the highest honor upon them. The difficulty of\r\npassing the river in a very severe night, and their march through a\r\nviolent storm of snow and hail, did not in the least abate their ardor;\r\nbut when they came to the charge each seemed to vie with the other in\r\npressing forward; and were I to give a preference to any particular\r\ncorps I should do great injustice to the others.\r\n\r\nColonel Baylor, my first aid-de-camp, will have the honor of delivering\r\nthis to you; and from him you may be made acquainted with many other\r\nparticulars. His spirited behavior upon every occasion requires me to\r\nrecommend him to your particular notice.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, etc.,\r\n\r\n    G.

It is the production of his mind,\r\n    and the high honor of it belongs to him clearly and\r\n    absolutely. To say that he performed his great work\r\n    well would be doing him an injustice. To say that\r\n    he did excellently well, admirably well, would be\r\n    inadequate and halting praise. Let us rather say\r\n    that he so discharged the duty assigned him that all\r\n    Americans may well rejoice that the work of drawing\r\n    the title-deed of their liberties devolved upon\r\n    him.—_Daniel Webster._\r\n\r\n    After Washington and Franklin there is no person who\r\n    fills so eminent a place among the great men of America\r\n    as Jefferson.—_Lord Brougham._\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nHis mind was great and powerful, without being of the very first order;\r\nhis penetration strong, though not so acute as that of a Newton, Bacon,\r\nor Locke; and as far as he saw, no judgment was ever sounder. It was\r\nslow in operation, being little aided by invention or imagination,\r\nbut sure in conclusion. Hence the common remark of his officers, of\r\nthe advantage he derived from councils of war, where, hearing all\r\nsuggestions, he selected whatever was best; and certainly no general\r\never planned his battles more judiciously. But if deranged during the\r\ncourse of the action, if any member of his plan was dislocated by\r\nsudden circumstances, he was slow in a re-adjustment. The consequence\r\nwas, that he often failed in the field, and rarely against an enemy\r\nin station, as at Boston and York. He was incapable of fear, meeting\r\npersonal dangers with the calmest unconcern. Perhaps the strongest\r\nfeature in his character was prudence, never acting until every\r\ncircumstance, every consideration was maturely weighed; refraining\r\nif he saw a doubt, but when once decided, going through with his\r\npurpose, whatever obstacles opposed. His integrity was most pure, his\r\njustice the most inflexible I have ever known; no motives of interest\r\nor consanguinity, of friendship or hatred, being able to bias his\r\ndecision. He was, indeed, in every sense of the word, a wise, a good,\r\nand a great man. His temper was naturally irritable and high-toned; but\r\nreflection and resolution had obtained a firm and habitual ascendency\r\nover it. If ever, however, it broke its bounds, he was most tremendous\r\nin his wrath. In his expenses he was honorable, but exact; liberal in\r\ncontributions to whatever promised utility; but frowning and unyielding\r\non all visionary projects, and all unworthy calls on his charity.\r\nHis heart was not warm in its affections; but he exactly calculated\r\nevery man’s value, and gave him a solid esteem proportioned to it.\r\nHis person, you know, was fine, his stature exactly what one would\r\nwish; his deportment easy, erect, and noble, the best horseman of his\r\nage, and the most graceful figure that could be seen on horseback.\r\nAlthough in the circle of his friends, where he might be unreserved\r\nwith safety, he took a free share in conversation, his colloquial\r\ntalents were not above mediocrity, possessing neither copiousness of\r\nideas nor fluency of words. In public, when called on for a sudden\r\nopinion, he was unready, short, and embarrassed. Yet he wrote readily,\r\nrather diffusely, in an easy and correct style. This he had acquired\r\nby conversation with the world, for his education was merely reading,\r\nwriting, and common arithmetic, to which he added surveying at a\r\nlater day. His time was employed in action chiefly, reading little,\r\nand that only in agriculture and English history. His correspondence\r\nbecame necessarily extensive, and with journalizing his agricultural\r\nproceedings, occupied most of his leisure hours within doors. On the\r\nwhole, his character was, in its mass, perfect, in nothing bad, in a\r\nfew points indifferent; and it may truly be said, that never did nature\r\nand fortune combine more completely to make a man great, and to place\r\nhim in the same constellation with whatever worthies have merited from\r\nman an everlasting remembrance. For his was the singular destiny and\r\nmerit of leading the armies of his country successfully through an\r\narduous war, for the establishment of its independence; of conducting\r\nits councils through the birth of a government, new in its forms and\r\nprinciples, until it had settled down into a quiet and orderly train;\r\nand of scrupulously obeying the laws through the whole of his career,\r\ncivil and military, of which the history of the world furnishes no\r\nother example.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOUGHTS FROM WILLIAM ELLERY CHANNING.\r\n\r\nON BOOKS.—It is chiefly through books that we enjoy intercourse with\r\nsuperior minds and these invaluable means of communication are in the\r\nreach of all. In the best books great men talk to us, give us their\r\nmost precious thoughts, and pour their souls into ours.\r\n\r\nGod be thanked for books! They are the voices of the distant and the\r\ndead, and make us heirs of the spiritual life of past ages.\r\n\r\nBooks are the true levelers. They give to all who will faithfully use\r\nthem, the society, the spiritual presence of the best and greatest of\r\nour race. No matter how poor I am. No matter though the prosperous of\r\nmy time will not enter my obscure dwelling. If the sacred writers will\r\nenter and take up their abode under my roof, if Milton will cross my\r\nthreshhold to sing to me of paradise, and Shakspere to open to me the\r\nworlds of imagination and the workings of the human heart, and Franklin\r\nto enrich me with his practical wisdom, I shall not pine for want of\r\nintellectual companionship, and I may become a cultivated man, though\r\nexcluded from what is called the best society in the place where I live.\r\n\r\nON LABOR.—Manual labor is a great good, but only in its just\r\nproportions. In excess it does great harm. It is not a good when\r\nmade the sole work of life. It must be joined with higher means of\r\nimprovement or it degrades instead of exalting. Man has a various\r\nnature which requires a variety of occupation and discipline for its\r\ngrowth. Study, meditation, society, and relaxation should be mixed up\r\nwith his physical toil. He has intellect, heart, imagination, taste, as\r\nwell as bones and muscles; and he is grievously wronged when compelled\r\nto exclusive drudgery for bodily subsistence.\r\n\r\nON POLITICS.—To govern one’s self (not others) is true glory. To serve\r\nthrough love, not to rule, is Christian greatness. Office is not\r\ndignity. The lowest men, because most faithless in principle, most\r\nservile to opinion, are to be found in office. I am sorry to say it,\r\nbut the truth should be spoken, that, at the present moment, political\r\naction in this country does little to lift up any who are concerned\r\nin it. It stands in opposition to a high morality. Politics, indeed,\r\nregarded as the study and pursuit of the true, enduring good of a\r\ncommunity, as the application of great unchangeable principles to\r\npublic affairs, is a noble sphere of thought and action, but politics,\r\nin its common sense, or considered as the invention of temporary\r\nshifts, as the playing of a subtle game, as the tactics of party for\r\ngaining power and the spoils of office, and for elevating one set of\r\nmen above another is a paltry and debasing concern.\r\n\r\nON SELF-DENIAL.—To deny ourselves is to deny, to withstand, to renounce\r\nwhatever, within or without, interferes with our conviction of right,\r\nor with the will of God. It is to suffer, to make sacrifice, for duty\r\nor our principles. The question now offers itself: What constitutes\r\nthe singular merit of this suffering? Mere suffering, we all know, is\r\nnot virtue. Evil men often endure pain as well as the good and are\r\nevil still. This, and this alone, constitutes the worth and importance\r\nof the sacrifice, suffering, which enters into self-denial, that it\r\nsprings from and manifests moral strength, power over ourselves, force\r\nof purpose, or the mind’s resolute determination of itself to duty.\r\nIt is the proof and result of inward energy. Difficulty, hardship,\r\nsuffering, sacrifices, are tests and measures of moral force and the\r\ngreat means of its enlargement. To withstand these is the same thing\r\nas to put forth power. Self-denial then is the will acting with power\r\nin the choice and prosecution of duty. Here we have the distinguishing\r\nglory of self-denial, and here we have the essence and distinction of a\r\ngood and virtuous man.\r\n\r\nON PLEASURE.—The first means of placing a people beyond the temptations\r\nto intemperance is to furnish them with the means of innocent\r\npleasure. By innocent pleasures I mean such as excite moderately;\r\nsuch as produce a cheerful frame of mind, not boisterous mirth; such\r\nas refresh, instead of exhausting, the system; such as are chastened\r\nby self-respect, and are accompanied with the consciousness that life\r\nhas a higher end than to be amused. In every community there _must_\r\nbe pleasures, relaxations and means of agreeable excitement; and if\r\ninnocent ones are not furnished, resort will be had to criminal. Men\r\ndrink to excess very often to shake off depression, or to satisfy\r\nthe restless thirst for agreeable excitement, and these motives\r\nare excluded in a cheerful community. A gloomy state of society in\r\nwhich there are few innocent recreations, may be expected to abound\r\nin drunkenness if opportunities are afforded. The savage drinks to\r\nexcess because his hours of sobriety are dull and unvaried, because\r\nin losing consciousness of his condition and his existence he loses\r\nlittle which he wishes to retain. The laboring classes are most exposed\r\nto intemperance, because they have at present few other pleasurable\r\nexcitements. A man, who, after toil, has resources of blameless\r\nrecreation is less tempted than other men to seek self-oblivion. He has\r\ntoo many of the pleasures of the man to take up those of the brute.\r\n\r\n    [End of Required Reading for November.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTUMN SYMPATHY.\r\n\r\nBy E. G. CHARLESWORTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The primrose and the violet,\r\n    The bloom on apricot and peach,\r\n    The marriage-song of larks in heights,\r\n    The south wind and the swallow’s nest;\r\n    All born of spring, I once loved best.\r\n\r\n    But now the dying leaf and flower,\r\n    The frost wind moaning in the pane,\r\n    The robin’s plaintive latter song,\r\n    The early sunset in the west;\r\n    All born of autumn, I love best.\r\n\r\n    Tell me, my heart, the reason why\r\n    Thy pulse thus beats with things that die;\r\n    Is it thine own autumnal sheaves?\r\n    Is it thine own dead fallen leaves?\r\n\r\n    —_London Sunday Magazine._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPUBLICAN PROSPECTS IN FRANCE.\r\n\r\nBy JOSEPH REINACH.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the very morrow of Gambetta’s death, and when that catastrophe had\r\nbeen interpreted by the immense majority of European opinion, as also\r\nby many Frenchmen, as the certain presage of the approaching triumph\r\nof advanced Radicalism—triumph to be followed by violent interior\r\ndiscords that would infallibly bring about the fall of the Republic and\r\nthe re-establishment either of Empire or of Royalty—I said that these\r\npredictions would not be realized, and, moreover, that Gambetta’s death\r\nwould but serve to hasten the triumph of his political ideas and party.\r\nI will cite, word for word, what I wrote at the end of January in a\r\npaper that appeared in this Review on February 1:\r\n\r\n“We even believe we may predict that the realization of several of\r\nGambetta’s ideas will meet with fewer obstacles, at least among a\r\ncertain fraction of public opinion, to-morrow than yesterday. A\r\nformidable reaction will take place in favor of the great statesman\r\nwhom we weep, a reaction in favor of his theories and his principles.\r\nIn short, we shall most likely witness the contrary of what has taken\r\nplace for some years. It was enough that Gambetta should defend a\r\ntheory for it to be attacked with fury. From henceforth it will often\r\nsuffice that an idea was formerly held up by Gambetta for it to be\r\nenthusiastically acclaimed. As in the story of Cid Campeador, it is his\r\ncorpse that leads his followers to victory.”\r\n\r\nWhat I foretold six months ago has been fulfilled in every point. Those\r\nvery Castilians who during Cid’s lifetime suspected him of the darkest\r\ndesigns and reviled him as a criminal—what did they do after his death?\r\nThey put the hero’s corpse in an iron coffin, and the black gravecloth\r\non the bier was the standard which, in the front rank of battle, led\r\nthe Spanish army to victory. And so has it been, or nearly so, with\r\nFrench Republicans and Gambetta. The political history of our country\r\nduring the last six months may be thus summed up: Out of Gambetta’s\r\ndeath-bed has arisen a first (not complete) victory for his ideas and\r\nfriends; from the party more specially organized by him have been\r\nchosen most men now in office, that they may execute his will.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, just after the excitement of the first few days,\r\nas soon as it became necessary for the Republicans to unite and stop\r\nthe Royalists who thought the fruit already ripe, what ministers did\r\nthe President of the Republic call for? M. Jules Ferry, who for the\r\nlast five years had been, if not the direct coadjutor, at least the\r\nmost invariable and faithful political ally of Gambetta, was made Prime\r\nMinister; M. Waldeck-Rousseau, the late Minister for Home Affairs under\r\nGambetta, and M. Raynal, the late Minister of Public Works, were both\r\nrecalled to the same offices. M. Challemel-Lacour, Gambetta’s most\r\nesteemed and devoted friend, was named Minister of Foreign Affairs, and\r\nM. Martin Feuillèe, Under-Secretary of State for Justice on November\r\n14, Minister of Justice; M. Margue, Under-Secretary of State for Home\r\nAffairs, resumed the same post. General Campenon could have been\r\nMinister of War had he wished it. And a great pity it is he declined\r\nhis friends’ proposals. Thus, in its general bearings, the Ferry\r\nMinistry is the Gambetta Ministry without Gambetta.\r\n\r\nExcept some secondary modifications made necessary by the change of\r\ncircumstances, the political program is about the same. Abroad an\r\nactive and steady diplomacy, the regular development of our colonial\r\npolitics, the consolidation of the protectorate in Tunis; at home\r\nthe constitution of a strong government, the methodical realization\r\nof social and democratic reforms, the policy of _scrutin de liste_,\r\nwhilst awaiting the abolition of _scrutin d’arrondissement_. The\r\nprincipal bills adopted last session, except the Magistracy bill, are\r\nbut legacies from the Gambetta Cabinet. Both cabinets are animated by\r\nthe same national spirit—national above all, but also progressist and\r\ngovernmental. The halo imparted by the presence of a man of genius\r\nis certainly wanting; but Carlyle’s _hero-worship_ is by no means a\r\ndemocratic necessity. There is certainly reason for rejoicing when a\r\nnation acknowledges and appreciates in one of its sons, sprung from its\r\nmidst, an intellect of the highest order. But when Alexander leaves\r\nlieutenants profoundly imbued with his spirit, formed in his school,\r\nmost desirous and capable of continuing his work—when these men,\r\ninstead of being at variance, remain, on the contrary, more strongly\r\nbound together than ever—there is certainly no reason for complaining\r\nand giving way to discouragement.\r\n\r\nThen it is not only in parliament that the _opportunist_ policy is\r\nagain getting the upper hand. Throughout the whole country it has\r\nregained the ground it had lost by the intrigues of hostile parties.\r\nThe great majority of Republicans have now recovered from a number of\r\ndiseases for which Gambetta had always prescribed the remedy—remedy,\r\nalas! that too many refused to stretch out their hand for. The mania\r\nfor decentralization is forgotten. The necessity for a strongly\r\nconstituted and vigorous central power is almost universally understood\r\nand acknowledged. Demagogue charlatans are for the most part unmasked.\r\nOur foreign policy is steadier—we are no longer afraid of Egyptian\r\nshadows. Intransigeants of the Right and Left still continue to see\r\nin our colonial enterprises but vulgar jobbing, and to denounce and\r\nrevile them in every possible way. But the great mass of the nation\r\nis no longer to be made a fool of, and has understood the necessity\r\nof extending France beyond the seas. There is a story of an English\r\npeasant who locked the stable door after the horse had been stolen.\r\nHappily for France she has several horses in her stables. If she has\r\nlost, at least for a time, her beautiful Arabian steed on the borders\r\nof the Nile, that is but an additional reason for taking jealous care\r\nof the others.—_The Nineteenth Century._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIN 404 Honorius was emperor. At that time, in the remote deserts of\r\nLibya, there dwelt an obscure monk named Telemachus. He had heard of\r\nthe awful scenes in the far-off Coliseum at Rome. Depend upon it, they\r\nlost nothing by their transit across the Mediterranean in the hands of\r\nGreek and Roman sailors. In the baths and market-places of Alexandria,\r\nin the Jewries of Cyrene, in the mouths of every itinerant Eastern\r\nstory-teller, the festive massacres of the Coliseum would doubtless be\r\nclothed in colors truly appalling, yet scarcely more appalling than the\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nTelemachus brooded over these horrors till his mission dawned upon\r\nhim. He was ordained by heaven to put an end to the slaughter of\r\nhuman beings in the Coliseum. He made his way to Rome. He entered\r\nthe Coliseum with the throng, what time the gladiators were parading\r\nin front of the emperor with uplifted swords and the wild mockery of\r\nhomage—“_Morituri te salutant._” Elbowing his way to the barrier, he\r\nleapt over at the moment when the combatants rushed at each other,\r\nthrew himself between them, bidding them, in the name of Christ, to\r\ndesist. To blank astonishment succeeded imperial contempt and popular\r\nfury. Telemachus fell slain by the swords of the gladiators. Legend\r\nmay adorn the tale and fancy fill out the picture, but the solid fact\r\nremains—_there never was another gladiatorial fight in the Coliseum_.\r\nOne heroic soul had caught the flow of public feeling that had already\r\nbegun to set in the direction of humanity, and turned it. He had\r\nembodied by his act and consecrated by his death the sentiment that\r\nalready lay timidly in the hearts of thousands in that great city\r\nof Rome. In 430 an edict was passed abolishing forever gladiatorial\r\nexhibitions.—_Good Words._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nALL merit ceases the moment we perform an act for the sake of its\r\nconsequences. Truly in this respect “we have our reward.”—_Wilhelm von\r\nHumboldt._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAUTAUQUA TO CALIFORNIA.\r\n\r\nBy FRANCES E. WILLARD, President N. W. C. T. U.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nI.—SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.\r\n\r\nIn one thing Chautauqua and California are alike—each is a climax, and\r\nboth are “made up of every creature’s best.” My sufficient consolation\r\nfor missing one of them this year is, that I saw the other. Let us\r\nspeed onward, then, taking Chautauqua as our point of departure, in a\r\nPickwickian sense only, unless for the further reason that it has the\r\nhigh prerogative of making all its happy denizens believe it to be\r\nthe center of gravity (and good times) for one planet at least; the\r\nmeridian from which all fortunate longitude is reckoned and all lucky\r\ntime-pieces set. Our swift train, “outward bound,” races along through\r\nthe old familiar East and the West no longer new.\r\n\r\n       “Through the kingdoms of corn,\r\n        Through the empires of grain,\r\n        Through dominions of forest;\r\n        Drives the thundering train;\r\n        Through fields where God’s cattle\r\n        Are turned out to grass,\r\n        And his poultry whirl up\r\n        From the wheels as we pass;\r\n    Through level horizons as still as the moon\r\n    With the wilds fast asleep and the winds in a swoon.”\r\n\r\nFrom a palace car with every eastern luxury, we gaze out on the\r\ndappled, pea-green hills of New Mexico and the wide, empty stretches\r\nof Arizona, stopping in Santa Fe—Columbia’s Damascus, in Albuquerque—a\r\npocket edition of Chicago, and in Tucson—the storm-center of\r\nsemi-tropic trade. But the “W. C. T. U.” is a plant of healing as\r\nindigenous to every soil for good as the saloon for evil, and in the\r\nfirst city the Governor’s wife has accepted leadership; in the second\r\nthat place is held by a lovely Ohio girl, the wife of a young lawyer;\r\nand in the third a leading woman of society and church work, whose\r\nhusband is one of Arizona’s most honored pioneers, consents to be our\r\nstandard-bearer. These way-side errands, with their delightful new\r\nfriendships and tender gospel lessons over, we hasten on to California.\r\nSome token of its affluent beauty comes to us on Easter Sabbath in the\r\none hundred calla-lilies sent from Los Angeles, five hundred miles\r\nbeyond, to adorn the church where we worship in Tucson, that marvelous\r\noasis in the desert. “Go on, and God be with you,” says the friend who\r\nescorts us to the train; “you’ll find Los Angeles a heaven on earth.”\r\nAnd so, indeed, we did, coming up out of the wilderness on a soft\r\nspring day, between fair, emerald hills that stood as the fore-runners\r\nof the choicest land on which were ever mirrored the glory and the\r\nloveliness of God.\r\n\r\nWe visited the thirty leading centers of interest and activity in the\r\ngreat Golden State during the two months of our stay, but when the\r\ncourteous mayor of this “city of the angels” welcomed us thither,\r\nand children heaped about us their baskets of flowers, rare, save\r\nin California, we told “His Honor” that of all the towns we had yet\r\nvisited—and they number a thousand at least—his was the one most fitly\r\nnamed.\r\n\r\nSouthern California, and this its exquisite metropolis, have been a\r\nterra incognita even to the intelligent, until the steam horse lately\r\ncaracoled this way. Now it is thronged by emigrants and tourists, men\r\nand women of small means reaping from half a dozen acres here what a\r\nlarge farm in Illinois could hardly yield, and invalids hitherto only\r\nan expense to their friends, finding the elixir of life in this balmy\r\nair, and joyously joining once more the energetic working forces of\r\nthe world. Flowers are so plenty here that banks and pyramids alone\r\ncan satisfy the claims of decorative art; baskets of roses are more\r\nfrequent than bouquets or even _boutonnieres_ with us. Heliotropes and\r\nfuchsias climb to the apex of the roof, while the common garden trees\r\nare oranges, lemons, limes, citrons, figs, olives and pomegranates.\r\nStrawberry short-cake can be had all the year round from the fresh\r\nfruit of one’s own garden, and oranges at the rate of nine thousand\r\nto one tree, and in some cases fifteen inches in circumference, have\r\nbeen raised in this vicinity. Riverside and Pasadena are adjacent\r\ncolonies and bear a stronger resemblance to one’s ideal Garden of Eden\r\nthan any other places I ever expect to see. Through groves of rarest\r\nsemi-tropic fruit trees you ride for miles, in the midst of beautiful,\r\nmodern homes, for the American renaissance is not more manifest in the\r\nsuburbs of Boston or Chicago than in Southern California. Fences are\r\nnowhere visible, the Monterey cypress furnishing a hedge which puts\r\nto blush the choicest of old England; the pepper tree with drooping\r\nbranches, and the Australian gum tree, tall and umbrageous, outlining\r\nlevel avenues whose vistas seem unending. Above all this are skies\r\nthat give back one’s best Italian memories, and for a background the\r\ntranquil amplitude of the Sierra Madre Mountains. What would you more?\r\n“See Naples and die” is an outworn phrase. “See California and live”\r\nhas been the magic formula of how many restored and happy pilgrims! The\r\ntonic of cold water has electrified this soil, seven years ago an utter\r\ndesert, so that now three years of growth will work a transformation\r\nthat fifteen would fail to bring about east of the Mississippi. To\r\nmy thinking this result is but a material prototype of the heavenly\r\nestate that shall come to our America when its arid waste of brains\r\nand stomachs, usurped by alcohol, shall learn the cooling virtues of\r\nthis same cold water. In Riverside my host planted in May of 1880,\r\ntwo thousand grape cuttings (not roots, remember), and in September,\r\n1881, gathered from them two hundred boxes of grapes. Pasadena was\r\nfounded by a good man from Maine, and is exempt from saloons by the\r\nprovisions of its charter. Here, from six acres, a gentleman realized\r\nthirteen hundred dollars, clear of all expenses, last year, by drying\r\nand sacking his grapes, instead of sending them to the winery. “The\r\nprofits were so much larger that hereafter his pocket-book will counsel\r\nhim, if not his conscience, to keep clear of the wine trade,” said the\r\nwide awake temperance woman who gave me the item. In Pasadena, Mrs.\r\nJennie C. Carr, whose fruit ranche and gardens, largely tilled by her\r\nown hands, disclose every imaginable variety which the most extravagant\r\nclimate can produce, sells at three thousand dollars per acre, land\r\npurchased by her for a mere song six years ago. In Santa Ana and San\r\nBernardino, also near Los Angeles, there is the same luxuriance and\r\nswift moving life. A county superintendent of schools told me he had\r\none school district that includes 160 miles of railroad, and has a town\r\nof 800 people, where three months ago there was silence and vacancy.\r\nAt San Diego, the most southerly town in California, we found the _ne\r\nplus ultra_ of climate for consumptives, its temperature ranging from\r\nfifty-five to seventy-five degrees, and its air dry. San Diego is\r\nthe oldest town in the State, having been established as a Catholic\r\n“Mission” in 1769. It is now altogether modernized and is Nature’s own\r\nsanitarium, besides being a lovely land-locked harbor of the Pacific.\r\nSanta Barbara, which we missed seeing, has a grape vine sixty years\r\nold, and a foot through, which in 1867 bore six tons of grapes, some\r\nof whose clusters weighed five pounds each. The railroad will soon\r\nmake this beautiful town accessible to rapid tourists to whom the\r\nocean is unkind. Twenty-one missions were founded over a century ago\r\nby Franciscan friars in Southern California. They brought with them\r\nfrom Spain the orange and the vine. They were conquerors, civilizers,\r\nsubduers of the soil. They brought cattle, horses, sheep, and—alas!\r\nhogs. They conquered the land for Spain without cruelty, baptizing\r\nthe Indians into the church and teaching them the arts of peace. Then\r\nfollowed the Mexican, then our own conquest of their territory, and now\r\nthe Anglo-Saxon reigns supreme in a land on which Nature has lavished\r\nall she had to give. Upon his victory over the alcohol habit, depends\r\nthe future of this goodly heritage. If he raises grapes he will\r\nsurvive; if he turns them into wine he must succumb.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.—SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY.\r\n\r\nWe crossed the famous and dangerous “Tehachapi Pass” at night, and\r\nwended our way slowly through this notable valley, three hundred miles\r\nin length by thirty-five in width, stopping to found the W. C. T. U. in\r\nits four chief towns, Fresno, Tulare, Merced, and Modesto.\r\n\r\nIrrigation is the watchword here, and as it takes capitalists to carry\r\nthis through on a scale so immense, large farms are now the rule. For\r\ninstance, we passed over one seventy-three miles in length by twenty in\r\nwidth. Later on, it is to be hoped these immense proprietaries may be\r\nsettled by men whose primary object is to establish and maintain homes.\r\nAt present, in the agricultural line, “big enterprises” are alone\r\nattractive. “Alfalfa,” a peculiarly hardy and luxuriant clover—imported\r\nby Governor Bigler from Chili—is the first crop, and grazing precedes\r\ngrain. This plant “strikes its roots six feet or more into the soil,\r\nand never requires a second planting, while every year there are five\r\ncrops of alfalfa and but two of wheat and barley.”\r\n\r\nVaried indeed is the population of this valley. One day we dine with a\r\npractical woman from Massachusetts, who declares that the sand storms,\r\nwhich most people consider the heaviest discount on the valley, are\r\n“really not so bad, for they polish off the house floors as nothing\r\nelse could.” The next we meet a group of earnest, motherly hearts from\r\na dozen different States, and almost as many religious denominations,\r\nunited to “provide for the common defense” of home against saloon. Next\r\nday a lawyer from Charleston invites us to his cozy residence, “because\r\nhis wife knows some of our Southern leaders in the W. C. T. U.” The\r\nnext we make acquaintance with half a dozen school ma’ams from the\r\nEast, who have taken a ranche and set up housekeeping for themselves;\r\nand in the fourth town visited an Englishman born in Auckland, New\r\nZealand, the leading criminal lawyer of the county, and instigator of\r\nthe woman’s crusade in Oakland, who gives us a graphic description of\r\nthat movement, which was a far-off echo of the Ohio pentecost.\r\n\r\nSo we move on at the rate of two meetings a day, with the hearty\r\nsupport of the united clergy (except the Episcopal, and often they\r\nhelped us, too), and the warm coöperation of the temperance societies,\r\nemerging in San Francisco, Monday, April 16, 1883.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.—SAN FRANCISCO.\r\n\r\nI am glad we did not so far forget ourselves as to arrive on Sunday,\r\nfor it appears that certain good, gifted, and famous persons, who shall\r\nbe nameless, telegraphed to certain Christian leaders of their intended\r\narrival on that day, and received answer: “The hour of your coming will\r\nfind us at church. The Palace is the best hotel.” Now on an overland\r\ntrip, an absent-minded traveler might fail to note the precise date\r\nof his arrival in the metropolis of the Pacific, but that would be no\r\nexcuse to our guid folk yonder, whose Sunday laws have been smitten\r\nfrom their statute books, and Christians hold themselves to strict\r\naccount for their example, which now alone conserves the Christian’s\r\nworship and the poor man’s rest.\r\n\r\nSan Francisco is probably the most cosmopolitan city now extant. Its\r\nthree hundred thousand people sound the gamut of nationality in the\r\nmost varying and dissonant chorus that ever greeted human ears. The\r\nstruggle for survival is an astonishing mixture of fierceness and\r\ngood-nature. Crowding along the streets, Irish and Chinaman, New\r\nEnglander and Negro, show kind consideration, but in the marts of\r\ntrade and at the polls “their guns are ballots, their bullets are\r\nideas.” Old-time asperities are softening, however, even on these\r\nbattlegrounds. The trend is upward, toward higher levels of hope and\r\nbrotherhood. Eliminate the alcohol and opium habits, and all these\r\nwould (and will ere long) dwell together in unity. Lives like those\r\nof Rev. Dr. Otis Gibson, and Mrs. Captain Goodall, invested for the\r\nChristianizing of the Chinese, or like that of Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper,\r\ndevoted to kindergartening the embryo “hoodlum,” or that of Dr. R. H.\r\nMcDonald, the millionaire philanthropist, consecrated to the temperance\r\nreform, are mighty prophecies of the good time coming.\r\n\r\nSan Francisco is the city of bay windows, and its people, beyond any\r\nother on this continent, believe in sunshine and fresh air. In like\r\nmanner, they are fond of ventilating every subject, are in nowise\r\nafraid of the next thing simply because it is the next, but have broad\r\nhospitality for new ideas. Rapid as the heel taps of its street life\r\nis the movement of its thought and the flame of its sympathy. Much as\r\nhas been said in its dispraise, Mount Diablo—the chief feature of its\r\nenvirons—is not so symbolic of its spirit as the white tomb of Thomas\r\nStarr King, which, standing beside one of its busiest streets, is a\r\nperpetual reminder of noble power conserved for noblest use. Everybody\r\nknows San Francisco’s harbor is without a rival save Puget Sound and\r\nConstantinople. Everybody has heard of its “Palace Hotel,” the largest\r\nin the world, and one that includes “eighteen acres of floor;” of\r\nits “endless chain” street cars, the inevitable outgrowth of dire\r\nnecessity in its up-hill streets; of its indescribable “Chinatown;” of\r\n“Seal Rock,” with its monster sea-lions, gamboling and howling year\r\nout and year in, for herein are the salient features of the strange\r\ncity’s individuality. For a metropolis but thirty-four years old,\r\nthe following record is unrivaled: Total value of real and personal\r\nproperty, $253,000,000; school property, $1,000,000; 130,000 buildings;\r\n11,000 streets; 12 street car lines; 33 libraries and reading-rooms; 38\r\nhospitals; 316 benevolent societies; 168 newspapers, and—the best fire\r\ndepartment in the world!\r\n\r\nThe two drawbacks of this wonderful city are its variable climate and\r\nits possible earthquakes. A witty writer warns the intending tourist\r\nthus: “Be sure to bring your _summer_ clothes. Let me repeat: be sure\r\nto bring your _winter_ clothes.” To state the fact that in August\r\none may see fur cloaks any day, and in January a June toilet is not\r\nuncommon, is but another way of stating that the galloping sea breeze,\r\nunimpeded by mountains, rushes in moist squadrons on the shore, and\r\nhas all seasons for its own, in which to battle with the genial warmth\r\nof this most lovely climate. As to earthquakes, there have been but\r\nthree since 1849, and these were insignificant calamities compared\r\nwith one year of our domesticated western tornadoes. Less than fifty\r\nlives have been lost in California by earthquakes, thirty-seven of\r\nthese occurring in the country outside of San Francisco, and less than\r\na hundred thousand dollars worth of property has been destroyed, while\r\ntwo millions would not cover our loss by cyclone in a single year,\r\nto say nothing of the number of victims. Civilization seems to have\r\na naturalizing effect on fleas, snakes and earthquakes, west of the\r\nSierras, but acts as a tonic upon hurricanes east of the Rockies. Will\r\nour scientists please “rise to explain” this mystery so close in its\r\nrelation to human weal and woe?\r\n\r\n    [To be continued.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MY BOOKS.\r\n\r\nBy LADY STIRLING-MAXWELL.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Silent companions of the lonely hour,\r\n    Friends, who can never alter or forsake,\r\n    Who for inconstant roving have no power,\r\n    And all neglect, perforce, must calmly take,\r\n    Let me return to you; this turmoil ending\r\n    Which worldly cares have in my spirit wrought,\r\n    And, o’er your old familiar pages bending,\r\n    Refresh my mind with many a tranquil thought:\r\n    Till, haply meeting there, from time to time,\r\n    Fancies, the audible echo of my own,\r\n    ’Twill be like hearing in a foreign clime\r\n    My native language spoke in friendly tone,\r\n    And with a sort of welcome I shall dwell\r\n    On these, my unripe musings, told so well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEARTHQUAKES—ISCHIA AND JAVA.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHENOMENA AND PROBABLE CAUSES.\r\n\r\nThese violent convulsions that from time to time shake and rend the\r\nearth, are among the most terrible calamities that come upon men,\r\ncausing immense destruction of property and of life. Their occurrence\r\nis often most unexpected.\r\n\r\nVillages, cities, and whole districts of densely populated countries\r\nsink beneath a sudden stroke, overwhelmed in a common ruin. If any\r\nwarning is given, the alarming premonitions rather confuse and paralyze\r\neffort, because, with the appalling certainty of disaster, there is\r\nnothing to show in what form it will come, or to indicate a place of\r\nrefuge.\r\n\r\nWhile the recent horrors at Ischia and in Java excite much painful\r\ninterest in the public mind, they naturally recall similar scenes\r\nof other years. Earthquakes of less destructive violence are very\r\nfrequent, and suggest greater power than is exerted. Even the slight\r\ntrembling, or vibratory motions, that produce no material injury,\r\nremind us of the prodigious forces that may at any moment burst their\r\nbarriers with great violence.\r\n\r\nIn every perceptible shock we feel the mighty pulsations of the\r\nagitated molten mass whose waves dash against the walls that restrain\r\nthem; or the struggling of compressed elastic gases, that must have\r\nvent, though their escape rend the earth. The crust between us and the\r\nseas of fire, whose extent no man knoweth, may be in places weakening,\r\ncut away, as the inner walls of a furnace by the molten metal; so the\r\ndanger may be nearer and greater than is known or feared. A devout\r\nman finds refuge and a comfortable assurance in the truth, “The Lord\r\nreigneth; in his hands are the deep places of the earth. The strength\r\nof the hills is his also.”\r\n\r\nThere are records of earthquakes more ancient than any books written\r\nby men. They antedate the earliest chapters of human history, and\r\nprobably belonged to the pre-adamite earth. If no human ear heard their\r\ntread, the footprints are still visible. In all mountainous regions\r\nthe evidence of their upheaval by some mighty force is too plain to be\r\ndoubted. The marine fossils found far up on their heights, the position\r\nof strata, often far from horizontal, with immense fissures, and chasms\r\nof unknown depth, all tell of disturbances that may have taken place\r\nbefore the historic period. If in those primitive times mountains were\r\nliterally carried into the midst of the sea, and vast tracts of the\r\nocean’s bed shoved up thousands of feet, it was only a more terrible\r\ndisplay of the gigantic powers still in action, and of whose workings\r\nthe centuries have borne witness.\r\n\r\nNo country seems to have escaped these terrible visitations, though\r\nsome suffer more than others. Volcanoes being of the same origin, they\r\nare more frequent in volcanic regions, and perhaps by their shocks the\r\nseething caldrons have been uncovered.\r\n\r\nThe same localities, as Southern Italy, and the neighboring island of\r\nSicily, have, from a remote period, at times been terribly shaken. From\r\n1783 to 1786 a thousand shocks were made note of, five hundred of which\r\nare described as having much force. Lyell considers them of special\r\nimportance, not because differing from like disturbances in other\r\nplaces, but because observed and minutely described by men competent to\r\ncollect and state such physical facts in a way to show their bearing on\r\nthe science of the earth. The following, collected from Lyell, Gibbon,\r\nHumboldt, and the encyclopædias, are facts respecting some of the\r\nprincipal earthquakes on record. Their statements, much condensed, are\r\nnot given in chronological order, but as we find them:\r\n\r\nIn 115, of the Christian era, Antioch in Syria, “Queen of the East,”\r\nbeautiful in itself, and beautiful for situation, a city of two hundred\r\nthousand inhabitants, was utterly ruined by earthquake. Afterward\r\nrebuilt, in more than all its ancient splendor, by Trajan, the tide of\r\nlife and wealth again flowed into it, and for centuries we read of no\r\nserious disasters of the kind. All apprehension of danger removed, the\r\npeople became famous for luxurious refinements, and, strangely enough,\r\nseem to have united high intellectual qualities with a passionate\r\nfondness for amusements. In 458 the city was again terribly shaken,\r\nand twice in the sixth century. Each time the destruction was nearly\r\ncomplete; but each time, in less than a century, the city was restored\r\nagain, but only to stand until 1822, and from that overthrow it has\r\nnever recovered, being now a miserable town of only six thousand\r\ninhabitants. The destruction of five populous cities, on one site,\r\ninvolved a fearful loss of life. Probably more than half a million\r\nthus perished. The most destructive earthquake in that, or any other\r\nlocality, of which we find any mention, was in 562. An immense number\r\nof strangers being in attendance at the festival of the Ascension,\r\nadded to the multitudes belonging to the city. Gibbon estimates that\r\ntwo hundred and fifty thousand persons were buried in the ruins.\r\n\r\nAmong the earliest accounts of earthquakes having particular interest,\r\nis the familiar one of that which destroyed Herculaneum and Pompeii\r\nin the year 63—about sixteen years before those cities were buried in\r\nscoria and ashes from Vesuvius.\r\n\r\nOf modern earthquakes three or four are here mentioned as presenting\r\nsome interesting phenomena. That of Chili, in 1822, caused the\r\npermanent elevation of the country between the Andes and the coast. The\r\narea thus raised is estimated at one hundred thousand square miles, and\r\nthe elevation from two to seven feet. Shore lines, at higher levels,\r\nindicate several previous upheavals of the same region, along about the\r\nsame lines. The opposite of this, a depression of land, was occasioned\r\nin the island of Jamaica in 1692, when Port Royal, the capital, was\r\noverwhelmed. A thousand acres or more thus sank in less than one\r\nminute, the sea rolling in and driving the vessels that were in the\r\nharbor over the tops of the houses.\r\n\r\nThe earthquake of New Madrid, below St. Louis, on the Mississippi,\r\nwas in 1811, and interesting as an instance of successive shocks, and\r\nalmost incessant quaking of the ground for months, and at a distance\r\nfrom any volcano. The agitation of the earth in Missouri continued\r\ntill near the time of the destruction of the city of Caracas, in South\r\nAmerica, and then ceased. One evening, about this time, is described by\r\nthe inhabitants of New Madrid as cloudless, and peculiarly brilliant.\r\nThe western sky was a continual glare from vivid flashes of lightning,\r\nand peals of thunder were incessantly heard, apparently proceeding,\r\nas did the flashes, from below the horizon. Comparatively little harm\r\nwas done in Missouri, but the beautiful city of Caracas, with its\r\nsplendid churches and palatial homes, was made a heap of ruins, beneath\r\nwhich twelve thousand of its inhabitants were buried. Just how these\r\nevents were related we know not. Whether the same pent-up forces that\r\nwere struggling in vain to escape in the valley of the Mississippi,\r\nfound vent in that distant locality, God only knows. The supposition\r\nallowed may account for the relief that came to the greatly troubled\r\nNew Madrid. The evils they dreaded came but in part—enough only to\r\nsuggest the greater perils they escaped. Over an extent of country\r\nthree hundred miles in length fissures were opened in the ground\r\nthrough which mud and water were thrown, high as the tops of the trees.\r\nFrom the mouth of the Ohio to the St. Francis the ground rose and fell\r\nin great undulations. Lakes were formed and drained again, and the\r\ngeneral surface so lowered that the country along the White River and\r\nits tributaries, for a distance of seventy miles, is known as “the sunk\r\ncountry.” Flint, the geographer, seven years after the event, noticed\r\nhundreds of chasms then closed and partially filled. They may yet, in\r\nplaces, be traced, having the appearance of artificial trenches.\r\n\r\nFissures are occasionally met in different parts of the country, which\r\nextend through solid rock to a great depth. “The Rocks” at Panama, N.\r\nY., have been elsewhere described, and furnish a profitable study.\r\n\r\nA more remarkable chasm of this kind extends from the western base of\r\nthe Shawangunk Mountain, near Ellenville, Ulster County, N. Y., for\r\nabout a mile to the summit. At first one can easily step across the\r\nfissure, but further up it becomes wider, till the hard vertical walls\r\nof sandstone are separated by a gorge several feet wide, and of great\r\ndepth. At the top an area of a hundred acres or more is rent in every\r\ndirection, the continuity of the surface being interrupted by steps\r\nof rocks, presenting abrupt walls. The gorge traced up the mountain\r\nbecomes a frightful abyss, more than a hundred feet wide. Among the\r\nloose stones at the bottom large trees are growing, whose tops scarce\r\nreach half way to the edge of the precipice. Most such disruptions\r\nof rocks and mountains were doubtless caused by earthquakes at some\r\nunknown period.\r\n\r\nThe great earthquake at Lisbon, the capital of Portugal, was in 1755.\r\n“The ominous rumbling sound below the surface was almost immediately\r\nfollowed by the shock which threw down the principal part of the city;\r\nin the short space of six minutes, it is believed, 60,000 perished. The\r\nsea rolled back, leaving the bar dry, and then returned, in a great\r\ntidal wave, fifty feet, or more, in height. The mountains around were\r\nshaken with great violence, their rocks rent, and thrown in fragments\r\ninto the valley below. Multitudes of people rushed from their falling\r\nbuildings to the marble quay, which suddenly sank with them, like a\r\nship foundering at sea; and when the waters closed over the place no\r\nfragments of the wreck—none of the vessels near by, that were drawn\r\ninto the whirlpool, and not one of the thousands of the bodies that\r\nwere carried down ever appeared again. Over the spot occupied by the\r\nquay, the water stood six hundred feet deep; and beneath it, locked in\r\nfissured rocks, and in chasms of unknown depth, lie what was the life\r\nand wealth of the place, in the middle of the eighteenth century.”\r\n\r\nEarthquakes, of especial interest, from their recent occurrence and\r\ndestructive effects, are those of 1857-58, in the kingdom of Naples,\r\nand in Mexico; but we have not room to more than mention them. The\r\npast summer will be remembered as the period of at least two terrible\r\ndisasters from earthquakes, in localities distant from each other.\r\nThe first, July 28, was at Ischia, a beautiful island at the north\r\nentrance of the bay of Naples. The principal town, Cassamicciola, was\r\nmostly destroyed, and much injury done at other places. The town was\r\na noted health resort, and it is feared many distinguished strangers\r\nperished in it. The shocks began in the night, when a majority of the\r\ncitizens, who frequent such places, were in the theater, and the scene\r\nthere was terrible. Lamps were overturned; clouds of dust arose, and\r\nthen the walls of the building opened, and fell, giving no opportunity\r\nfor escape. The ground opened in many places, and houses and their\r\ninhabitants were swallowed up. The hotel Picola Sentinella sank into\r\nthe earth, with all its inmates. The number destroyed, first estimated\r\nat three thousand, was much larger, but how much is not yet certainly\r\nknown. Years must elapse before the town is restored, when it will be\r\nwith a new class of inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe sad tidings of disaster in Italy were soon followed by still more\r\nstartling intelligence from Java, where, as in regions bordering on\r\nthe Mediterranean, earthquakes are not a new experience with the\r\ninhabitants. A recital of the calamities occurring in Java during\r\nthe last century would make a gloomy chapter in history, suggesting\r\nthe insecurity and transitory nature of all earthly possessions. The\r\nisland is one of the largest and, commercially, most important, in the\r\nIndian archipelago, six hundred and sixty miles in length, and the\r\nwidth varying from forty to one hundred and thirty miles. It is densely\r\npopulated, and governed by a Dutch viceroy. In the mountain range\r\nextending through the center, with a mean elevation of seven thousand\r\nfeet, are many volcanoes; and earthquakes are of frequent occurrence,\r\nas in other volcanic regions. In 1878 record was made of some sixteen,\r\nin different parts of the island. One of the most famous, accompanied\r\nby a vast eruption of Papandayang, the largest of the volcanoes,\r\ntook place a hundred years ago, overwhelming an area of a hundred\r\nsquare miles, and destroying three thousand people—the island at that\r\ntime having fewer inhabitants. There were two similar eruptions from\r\nvolcanoes at the same time, respectively one hundred and thirty-four\r\nand three hundred and fifty-two miles from Papandayang, suggesting the\r\nfact that the power of producing them, and the earthquakes, may operate\r\nthrough a field of vast extent, and breaks through where the barriers\r\ngive way. It is safe to say both have the same origin.\r\n\r\nIschia and Java, though almost antipodes, are companions in disaster,\r\nand possibly felt the dashing of the same billows, striking with\r\nviolence here or there, according as some mighty impulse drove them\r\non. The great calamities of the past summer, besides their appeal to\r\nour humanity, will be of interest to scientific men, and may throw\r\nlight on the relations of earthquakes and volcanoes, and their cause,\r\nafter which they have been searching a good deal in the dark, and with\r\nresults not yet satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe accounts of the last fearful disaster are yet incomplete, and may\r\nnot all be verified. The latest, and apparently most reliable reports,\r\nplace it among the most terrible calamities known in the history of\r\nthe race, since the deluge. The earth trembled and shook—rocks were\r\nrent—buildings tumbled in ruins. A large part of the city, full of\r\nwealth and life, sank out of sight. Tidal waves carried destruction\r\nalong the coast. Volcanoes belched forth smoke, ashes and lava,\r\noverspreading fertile valleys; and when the sulphurous clouds that hung\r\nover them, black as night, were lifted, turbulent waters rolled over\r\nfifty square miles of pasture lands that the day before were covered\r\nwith flocks, and the homes of men. It is estimated that seventy-five\r\nthousand people perished. It may be a few thousand less, or more,\r\nas there are yet no data from which to form more than a proximate\r\nestimate. The whole number will not be known till the graves and the\r\nsea give up their dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOW SPIRITS.\r\n\r\nBy J. MORTIMER GRANVILLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is enough in the daily experience of life to depress the feelings\r\nand rob the mind of its buoyancy, without having to encounter lowness\r\nof spirits as a besetting mental state or malady. Nevertheless, it so\r\nfrequently assumes the character of an affection essentially morbid,\r\nattacks individuals who are not naturally disposed to despondency,\r\nand gives so many unmistakable proofs of its close relations with the\r\nhealth of the physical organism, that it must needs be included in the\r\ncategory of disease. The constitutional melancholy which distinguishes\r\ncertain types of character and development, is a setting in the minor\r\nkey rather than depression. Within the compass of a lower range,\r\nindividuals of this class exhibit as many changes of mood as those\r\nwhose temperament is, so to say, pitched higher, and who therefore seem\r\nto be capable of greater elation.\r\n\r\nIt is important to ascertain at the outset whether a particular person\r\nupon whom interest may be centered is not naturally characterized by\r\nthis restrained or reserved tone of feeling! Unhealthy conditions of\r\nmind are generally to be recognized by the circumstance that they offer\r\na contrast to some previous state. The movable, excitable temperament\r\nmay become fixed and seemingly unimpressionable, the self-possessed\r\nbegin to be irritable, the calm, passionate. It is the _change_ that\r\nattracts attention, and when low spirits come to afflict a mind wont\r\nto exhibit resilience and joyousness, there must be a cause for the\r\naltered tone, and prudence will enjoin watchfulness. Mischief may be\r\ndone unwittingly by trying to stimulate the uncontrollable emotions.\r\n\r\nThere are few more common errors than that which assumes lowness\r\nof spirits to be a state in which an appeal should be made to the\r\nsufferer. We constantly find intelligent and experienced persons,\r\nwho show considerable skill in dealing with other mental disorders\r\nand disturbances, fail in the attempt to relieve the pains of\r\nmelancholy. They strive by entreaty, expostulation, firmness, and even\r\nbrusqueness, to coerce the victim, and prevail upon him to shake off\r\nhis despondency. They urge him to take an interest in what is passing\r\naround, to bestir himself, and put an end to his broodings. This would\r\nbe all very well if the burden that presses so heavily on the spirit\r\nsimply lay on the surface, but the lowness of which I am speaking\r\nis something far deeper than can be reached by “rallying.” It is a\r\nfreezing of all the energies; a blight which destroys the vitality, a\r\npoison which enervates and paralyzes the whole system.\r\n\r\nIt is no use probing the consciousness for the cause while the\r\ndepression lasts—as well look for the weapon by which a man has been\r\nstruck senseless to the earth, when the victim lies faint and bleeding\r\nin need of instant succor. If the cause were found at such a moment,\r\nnothing could be done to prevent its further mischief. Supposing it to\r\nbe discovered that the malady is the fruit of some evil-doing or wrong\r\nmanagement of self, the moment when a crushed spirit is undergoing\r\nthe penalty of its error is not that which should be selected for\r\nremonstrance. It is vain to argue with a man whose every faculty of\r\nself-control is at its lowest ebb. The judgment and the will are\r\ndormant. The show of feeling made by the conscience in the hour of\r\ndejection is in great part emotional, and the purposes then formed\r\nare sterile. The tears of regret, the efforts of resolve, elicited in\r\nthe state of depression, are worse than useless; they are like the\r\nstruggles of a man sinking in the quicksand—they bury the mind deeper\r\ninstead of freeing it.\r\n\r\nThe state of mental collapse must be allowed to pass; but here comes\r\nthe difficulty; the moment reaction takes place, as shown by a slight\r\nraising of the cloud, it will be too late to interfere. The mind\r\nwill then have entered on another phase not less morbid than the\r\ndepression which it has replaced. There is no certain indication of\r\nthe right moment to make the effort for the relief of a sufferer from\r\nthis progressive malady. The way to help is to watch the changes of\r\ntemperament narrowly, and, guided by time rather than symptoms, to\r\npresent some new object of interest—a trip, an enterprise, a congenial\r\ntask—at the moment which immediately precedes the recovery. The soul\r\nlies brooding—it is about to wake; the precise time can be foreknown\r\nonly by watching the course of previous attacks; whatever engrosses the\r\nrousing faculties most powerfully on waking, will probably hold them\r\nfor awhile. It is a struggle between good and healthy influences on the\r\none hand, and evil and morbid on the other. If it be earnestly desired\r\nto rescue the sufferer, the right method must be pursued, and wrong\r\nand mischief-working procedures—among which preaching, persuading,\r\nmoralizing, and rallying are the worst and most hurtful—ought to be\r\ncarefully avoided. When the thoughts are revived and the faculties\r\nrebound, they must be kept engaged with cheering and healthful subjects.\r\n\r\nThere is no greater error than to suppose good has been accomplished\r\nwhen a melancholic patient has been simply aroused. The apparently\r\nbright interval of a malady of this class is even more perilous than\r\nthe period of exhaustion and lowness. The moment the mind resumes\r\nthe active state, it generally resumes the work of self-destruction.\r\nThe worst mischief is wrought in the so-called lucid interval. The\r\nconsciousness must be absorbed and busied with healthful exercise,\r\nor it will re-engage in the morbid process which culminates in\r\ndepression. The problem is to keep off the next collapse, and this can\r\nbe accomplished only by obviating the unhealthy excitement by which it\r\nis commonly preceded and produced. Healthy activity promotes nutrition,\r\nand replenishes the strength of mind and body alike; all action that\r\ndoes not improve the quality of the organ acting, deteriorates it and\r\ntends to prevent normal function.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE VILLAINS.\r\n\r\nBy R. TURNER.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LARGER FUNGI.\r\n\r\nTo become acquainted with the bulkier of these villains, we must visit\r\ntheir favorite haunts. An occasional one may occur in any kind of\r\nplace, as has already been explained. A good many, especially of the\r\nedible sort, and notably the common mushroom, grow in open pastures.\r\nTo get among crowds of them, however, we must resort to close woods,\r\nespecially of fir and pine. There they grow on tree-stumps, fallen\r\ntrunks, and on the ground, in great variety and abundance. If we go at\r\nthe proper season their profusion will astonish us. This time of plenty\r\nvaries from early to late autumn with the character of the weather.\r\nClad in waterproof wraps and with leather gloves on hand, we may make\r\na fungus foray into the dripping woods amid russet and falling leaves\r\nwith comparative comfort; and even on a “raw rheumatic day” there will\r\nlikely be much enjoyment for us and still more instruction. It will\r\nbe strange, indeed, if we do not find some kinds to eat and very many\r\nto think over. We ought to get examples, at least, of nearly all the\r\ndifferent families. Let us consider them in a general way as novices\r\ndo. A host of them have gills like the mushroom; and so we may take\r\nthat best known of them all as a type of the whole class. Mushroom\r\nspawn runs through the soil in a rootlike way, absorbing the organic\r\nmatter it falls in with and every here and there swelling out into\r\nroundish bodies, each consisting of a tubercle enclosed in a wrapper.\r\nThe tubercle bursts through the wrapper as growth goes on, and soon\r\nabove ground appears the well-known form of the mushroom, with a stalk\r\nsupporting a fleshy head by the center, and on the under surface of\r\nthis head radiating gills, which are at first covered by a veil that\r\nfinally gives way and leaves only a ring round the stem. These gills\r\nare originally flesh-colored, but afterward become brown and mottled\r\nwith numerous minute purple spores. If we were to investigate further\r\nby means of the microscope, we should find that the spores are not\r\ncontained in any case, and that they are produced in fours on little\r\npoints at the tips of special cells. Of the other kinds belonging to\r\nthis order of agarics, some differ from the mushroom in being poisonous\r\nand others in being parasitic. There is much variety, also, in the\r\ntints of gill and spore, different kinds having these white, pink,\r\nrosy, salmon-colored, reddish, or yellowish, or darkish brown, purple\r\nor black. Again, in some the stem is not central, but attached more or\r\nless laterally to the head; in others there is no stem, and the gills\r\nradiate out from the substance on which the agaric grows. The ring\r\nround the stalk, too, often varies, or is sometimes wanting. There\r\nare many other differences, and it is by these that we are able to\r\ndistinguish the one kind from the other: but, of course, little more\r\ncan be done here than merely to indicate this infinite variety. Dr.\r\nBadham, in his admirable work on the “Esculent Funguses of England,”\r\nputs this quaintly, as he does many other facts. “These are stilted\r\nupon a high leg, and those have not a leg to stand on; some are\r\nshell-shaped, many bell-shaped; and some hang upon their stalks like a\r\nlawyer’s wig.”\r\n\r\nThese gill-bearers, are, however, but one order in this extensive\r\ndivision of plants. Nature’s plastic hand is never weary of shaping\r\nfresh forms. It is lavish of variety, and never works in a stinted\r\nor makeshift way. In place of gills we find in another order tubes\r\nor pores in which the spores are produced. These tubular kinds\r\nare sometimes fleshy, as in the edible boletus, or woody, as in\r\nthe polypores, popularly called sap-balls, which every one who\r\nknows anything about woods and their wonders must have seen on old\r\ntree-stumps, often growing to a great size. In yet another order,\r\nspines, or bristles, or teeth, take the place of gills and tubes. In\r\nthe puff-balls the spores ripen inside a roundish leathern case, which\r\nafterward bursts and discharges them as a fine dust. Then there is an\r\nextensive class in which the spores are not produced in this offhand\r\nway at all, but are carefully enclosed in little cases, or rather, I\r\nshould say, loaded into microscopic guns, as in the pezizas; and very\r\nbeautiful objects these are under the microscope.\r\n\r\nPoisonous, putrescent, strange in shape, or color, or odor, as many\r\nof the larger fungi are, it is little to be wondered at that contempt\r\nhas been a common human feeling with respect to most of them, and a\r\ncrush with disdainful heel on occasion the lot of a good many. The\r\npopular loathing has run out into language. Under the opprobrious\r\nterm “toadstool,” a whole host of kinds is commonly included. The\r\npuff-balls are known in Scotland as “de’il’s sneeshin’-mills” (devil’s\r\nsnuff-boxes), an epithet which expresses with a certain imaginative\r\nhumor, and a dash of superstition, the idea of something so utterly\r\nbase that it ministers to the gratification of demons, tickling their\r\nolfactory organs with satanic satisfaction. Indeed, in this country\r\nthe mushroom is almost the only favored exception to the popular\r\nverdict of loathing. It has gained the hearts of the people through\r\ntheir stomachs, and ketchup has overcome popular prejudice by its fine\r\nflavor. But there are many others on which cultured palates dote.\r\nTruffles are dear delicacies, which few but rich men taste, for fine\r\naroma and flavor command a high price. The Scotch-bonnets of the fairy\r\nrings, besides possessing a certain bouquet of elfin romance, cook\r\ninto delicacies full of stomachic delight. Then there are chantarells\r\nand morels and blewitts, and poor-men’s-beef-steaks, over which\r\ntrained appetites rejoice. A score of dainty little rogues at least\r\nthere are, and a still greater number of kinds that are nutritive\r\nand fairly palatable. In some European countries the edible ones are\r\na really valuable addition to the food of the people—not from being\r\nmore plentiful than with us, but from being more eagerly gathered and\r\ndiligently cultivated. One sort or other is used as food by every\r\ntribe of men. Not only does the edible mushroom occur in all habitable\r\nlands, but in certain foreign parts—as in Australia—there are forms of\r\nit very much superior in quality to our English ones. Then, of course,\r\nevery clime has its own peculiar edible kinds. The native bread of the\r\nAustralians is an instance in point; it looks somewhat like compressed\r\nsago, and is a fairly good article of diet. The staple food of the\r\nwild Fuegians for several months each year is supplied by a kind which\r\nthey gather in great abundance from the living twigs of the evergreen\r\nbeech. Then there are some not very pleasant, according to our ideas,\r\nwhich can be safely used, and are thus available in times of scarcity,\r\nas, for instance, the gelatinous one which the New Zealand natives\r\nknow as “thunder-dirt,” and one somewhat similar that the Chinese are\r\nsaid to utilize. A curious trade has of late years sprung up between\r\nNew Zealand and China. A brown semi-transparent fungus, resembling the\r\nhuman ear, grows abundantly in the North Island. This the Maoris and\r\nothers collect, dry, and pack into bags, for export to China, where\r\nit is highly prized for its flavor and gelatinous qualities as an\r\ningredient in soup. It is a species nearly related to our Jew’s-ear.\r\nThe value of this fungus exported from New Zealand in 1877 was stated\r\nat over £11,000.—_Good Words._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    When we reflect how little we have done\r\n    And add to that how little we have seen,\r\n    And furthermore how little we have won\r\n    Of joy or good, how little known or been,\r\n    We long for other life, more full, more keen,\r\n    And yearn to change with those\r\n    Who well have run.\r\n                         —_Jean Ingelow._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA TALENT for any art is rare; but it is given to nearly every one to\r\ncultivate a taste for art; only it must be cultivated with earnestness.\r\nThe more things thou learnest to know and enjoy, the more complete and\r\nfull will be for thee the delight of living.—_Platen._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM THE BALTIC TO THE ADRIATIC.\r\n\r\nBy the author of “German-American Housekeeping,” etc.\r\n\r\n    [Concluded.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTravelers are like conchologists, vying with one another in picking\r\nup different shells, and herein lies the unending interest of their\r\nrecords.\r\n\r\nIn the roundabout route from the Baltic to the Adriatic and\r\nMediterranean, Cassel, the electorate in former years of Hesse-Cassel,\r\nafforded a most suggestive visit. To be sure, its history is not\r\naltogether pleasant to an American, for the fact that the old elector\r\nhired his troops to England to fight us during the Revolutionary\r\nwar, is not a savory bit of German history. Even Frederick the Great\r\nsaw the meanness of it, for when he heard they were to take their\r\nroute to England by Prussian roads, he sent word, “if they did so, he\r\nwould levy a cattle tax on them.” Perhaps some of the money paid by\r\nEngland at that time was laid up in the public treasury and expended\r\nafterward upon the extravagant ornamentation of the grounds of the\r\nelector’s summer residence, “Wilhelmshöhe.” The palace is in itself\r\none of the most magnificent in Europe. Above the cascades in front\r\nof it is the highest fountain on the continent. One stream, twelve\r\ninches in diameter, is thrown to the height of two hundred feet. The\r\ncolossal Hercules which crowned the summit of this artificial grandeur\r\nwas thirty feet high, and the cascades are nine hundred feet long.\r\nThe whole arrangement is said to have kept two thousand men engaged\r\nfor fourteen years, and to have cost over ten million dollars! Jerome\r\nNapoleon occupied this palace of Wilhelmshöhe when he was king of\r\nWestphalia.\r\n\r\nA walk of three miles under the straight and narrow road shaded by lime\r\ntrees, leads one back to Cassel, after this visit to Wilhelmshöhe.\r\nThe town is beautifully situated on either side of the river Fulda,\r\nand has a population of thirty-two thousand. The beautiful terrace\r\noverlooking the _angarten_, crowned by its new picture gallery, offers\r\nas delightful promenades as the celebrated Dresden Terrace. The strains\r\nof sweet music coming up from the _angarten_ (meadow) while one is\r\nlooking at the beautiful Rembrandts and Van Dykes in the gallery,\r\ngive the enchantment which one never fails to find in a German town.\r\nNapoleon carried away many of the most valuable pictures from the\r\nCassel gallery—but it is redeemed from the number of horrible Jordaens\r\nand Teniers by possessing the “pearl of Rembrandts,” a portrait of\r\n“Saskia,” his wife.\r\n\r\nChemical products, snuff included, are manufactured in Cassel, and\r\nit is quite a wide-awake business place—the old town preserved for\r\npicturesque effect, and the new town building up for enterprising\r\nmanufacturers.\r\n\r\nLeaving Cassel any day at one o’clock, one can reach Coblenz at\r\nhalf-past seven in the evening, and the Bellevue Hotel will shelter one\r\ndelightfully for the night, provided a room on the _hof_, or court,\r\nis not given. Four hundred feet above the river at Coblenz stands the\r\nold fortress of “Ehrenbreitstein.” How fine its old gray stone and\r\nits commanding situation is! No wonder Auerbach, the novelist, in his\r\n“Villa on the Rhine,” devoted so many pages to Ehrenbreitstein, the\r\nGibraltar of the Rhine. It cost the government five million dollars.\r\nWith its four hundred cannon, and capacity to store provision for ten\r\nyears for eight thousand men in its magazine, well may it scorn attacks\r\n“as a tempest scorns a chain.”\r\n\r\nInstead of driving up to see this monstrous fortress, one may prefer\r\nto wander into St. Castor’s Church in the early morning, and, like\r\na devout Catholic, kneel and pray. It may be more restful to thus\r\n“commune with one’s own heart and be still,” than to keep up a\r\nperpetual sight-seeing. Charlemagne divided his empire among his\r\ngrandchildren in this very church. It dates to the eighth century,\r\nand is one of the best specimens of Lombard architecture in all the\r\nRhine provinces. Coming out in the morning about ten o’clock, the sun\r\nwill light up the severe outlines of the great old Ehrenbreitstein\r\nacross the river, and the thought comes to one, did Luther compose his\r\ncelebrated hymn, “_Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott_” (A mighty fortress\r\nis our God), while in such a moment of inspiration as this scene\r\nproduces upon the mind?\r\n\r\nWe left Coblenz at ten o’clock on the steamer “Lorlei” for Mainz. This\r\nromantic name for our boat, the waters we were plying, St. Castor’s\r\nChurch on the left, and Ehrenbreitstein on the right, brought a\r\nstrange combination of war, romance and religion to the mind. The\r\nonly prosaic moment which seized me was in passing the Lorlei Felsen\r\non the Rhine—when instead of remembering Lorlei, I exclaimed, so my\r\ncompanions told me: “O! here is where they catch the fine salmon!”\r\nRheinstein was to my mind the most beautiful and picturesque castle of\r\nall, and being owned by the Crown Prince is kept in becoming repair.\r\nThe little “_panorama des Rheins_” is a troublesome little companion,\r\nfor it leaves one not a moment for calm enjoyment and forgetfulness,\r\nconstantly pointing out the places of interest and crowding their\r\nhistory and romance upon one.\r\n\r\nThe Dom at Mainz is a curious study for an architect—combining as it\r\ndoes so many styles and containing such curious old tombs.\r\n\r\nFrankfort, the birthplace of Goethe, and the native place of the\r\nRothschilds family, has too much history to detail in an article like\r\nthis. When it was a free city it had, and still retains, I believe, the\r\nreputation of being the commercial capital of that part of Germany.\r\n\r\nGoethe preferred little Weimar for the development of his poetical\r\nlife. His father’s stately house in Frankfort, still to be seen, was\r\nnot equal to his own in Weimar.\r\n\r\nBut let us leave the river Main and the river Rhine and look up\r\nNuremberg and Munich before we follow our southern course to the\r\nAdriatic. An erratic journey this, but have we not found some shells\r\nwhich the other conchologists overlooked?\r\n\r\nNuremberg seems to have lost more in population than any German city we\r\nknow of. Having once numbered 100,000, it now claims only 55,000. It is\r\na curious fact that Nuremberg toys which were so celebrated formerly,\r\nhave been surpassed in this country, and now American manufactures in\r\nthis line are taken to Nuremberg and actually sold as German toys.\r\nThis was told me by a gentleman interested in the trade. But buy a\r\nlead-pencil in Nuremberg if you want a good article very cheap—perhaps\r\nyou can learn to draw or sketch with one, being inspired with the\r\nmemory of Albert Dürer.\r\n\r\nNuremberg is Bavaria’s second largest city, and attracts more\r\nforeigners or visitors than Munich, perhaps, yet to the mind of the\r\nBavarian Munich is Bavaria, as to the Frenchman Paris is France, and\r\nto the Prussian Berlin is Prussia! No traveler can be contented,\r\nhowever, without some time in Nuremberg, although I dare say many go\r\naway disappointed. The old stone houses with their carved gables, the\r\nwalls and turrets, St. Sebald Church, and the fortress where Gustavus\r\nAdolphus with his immense army was besieged by Wallenstein, are things\r\nwhich never grow tedious to the memory. In this fortress now they keep\r\nthe instruments of torture used in the middle ages to extract secrets\r\nfrom the criminal or the innocent, as it might chance to be. A German\r\nin Berlin laughingly told me when I described the rusty torturous\r\nthings, that they were all of recent manufacture, and were not the\r\ngenuine articles at all! But new or old, genuine or reproduced, they\r\nmake one shudder as does Fox’s “Book of Martyrs.” I know of no church\r\nin Germany more worthy of study than St. Sebald’s. In it one finds a\r\ncurious old gold lamp, which swings from the ceiling about half way\r\ndown one aisle of the church. It is called _die ewige lampe_, because\r\nit has been always burning since the twelfth century. It is related of\r\none of Nuremberg’s respectable old citizens that he was returning in\r\nthe darkness one stormy night to his home, and finally almost despaired\r\nof finding his way, when a faint light from the St. Sebald’s Church\r\nenabled him to arrive safe at his own door. He gave a fund to the\r\nchurch afterward for the purpose of keeping there a perpetual light.\r\nWhen the Protestants took St. Sebald’s, as they did so many Catholic\r\nchurches in Germany after the Reformation, the interest money which the\r\nold man gave had still to be used in this way according to his will. So\r\n_die ewige lampe_ still swings and gives its dim light to the passer-by\r\nat night. Our American consul told me a characteristic story of an\r\nAmerican girl and her mother, whom he was showing about Nuremberg, as\r\nwas his social duty, perhaps. They were in St. Sebald’s Church, and\r\nhe related the story of the lamp as they stood near it. Underneath\r\nstands a little set of steps which the old sexton ascends to trim the\r\nlamp. “Oh!” said this precocious American girl, “I shall blow it out,\r\nand then their tradition that it has never been out will be upset.” So\r\nshe climbed the steps fast, and as she was about to do this atrocious\r\nthing our consul pulled her back, and said she would be in custody in\r\nan hour, and he would not help her out. The mother merely laughed, and\r\nevidently saw nothing wrong about the performance. It is just such\r\nsmart acts on the part of American girls abroad which induce a man\r\nlike Henry James to write novels about them. The fine, intelligent,\r\nself-poised girls travel unnoticed, while the “Daisy Millers” cause the\r\njudgment so often passed upon all American girls by foreigners, that\r\nthey are “an emancipated set.”\r\n\r\nIt was our good fortune while in Munich to board with most agreeable\r\npeople. The _Herr Geheimrath_ (privy counselor) had retired from active\r\nlife of one kind, to enjoy the privilege of being an antiquarian\r\nand art critic. He had his house full of most valuable and curious\r\ntreasures. The study of ceramics was his hobby, and fayence, porcelain,\r\nand earthenwares of the rarest kinds were standing around on his\r\ndesk, on cabinets, and on the floor. He edited _Die Wartburg_, a\r\npaper which was the organ of _Münchener Alterthum-Verein_, and wrote\r\nweekly articles _Ueber den Standpunkt unserer heutigen Kunst_. His\r\nwife was formerly the _hof-singerin_ (court-singer) at the royal opera\r\nin Munich, but was then too old to continue. Every Saturday evening\r\nshe would give a home concert, and would sing the lovely aria from\r\n“Freischutz,” or Schumann’s songs.\r\n\r\nSt. Petersburg never looked whiter from snow than did Munich that\r\nwinter. The galleries were cold, but the new and old Pinakothek were\r\ntoo rich to be forsaken. Fortunately the new building was just across\r\nthe street from the _Herr Geheimrath’s_. If it had only been the\r\nold Pinakothek I found myself continually saying, for who cares for\r\nKaulbachs, and modern German art, compared with the rich Van Dykes,\r\nthe Rubens, the Dürers, and the old Byzantine school? I should say the\r\nMunich gallery is superior to the Dresden in numbers, but not in gems.\r\nBut they have fine specimens from the Spanish, the Italian, and German\r\nschools.\r\n\r\nThe Glyptothek is Munich’s boast. There is a stately grandeur in this\r\nbuilding that suggests Greece and her art. On a frosty morning, to\r\nwander out beyond the Propylæum and enter through the great bronze door\r\nof the Glyptothek, one feels like a mouse entering a marble quarry. I\r\npresume there is no such collection of originals in any country but\r\nItaly. Ghiberti, Michael Angelo, Benvenuti, Cellini, Peter Vischer,\r\nThorwaldsen, Canova, Rauch, Schwanthaler, are all represented by\r\noriginal works. But it needs a warm climate to make such a collection\r\nof statuary altogether attractive.\r\n\r\nGoing from Germany to Italy, one takes the “Brenner Pass,” generally,\r\nover the Alps—the oldest way known, and used by Hannibal. After winding\r\naround the side of these snowy peaks, and being blinded by the mists\r\nenveloping the landscape, trembling with admiration or fear, as the\r\ncase may be, a glimpse of sunny Italy is most encouraging.\r\n\r\nTo reach the Adriatic and Venice is enough earthly joy for some\r\nsouls. Elizabeth Barrett Browning felt so; and all people feel so,\r\nperhaps, who, as Henry James and W. D. Howells, give themselves up to\r\nVenice, and write about her until she becomes identified with their\r\nreputation. But let Venice and the Adriatic be silent factors in this\r\narticle, and let Verona, Florence, and Rome substitute them.\r\n\r\nWe alighted at Verona at midnight, and in the pale moonlight, which\r\ngave a ghastly appearance to the quaint old place. “The Two Gentlemen\r\nof Verona” were not to be seen that night. The streets were silent, yet\r\nI thought perhaps they might greet us in the morning; but their shadowy\r\nold cloaks are only to be seen thrown around a thousand beggars, who\r\nare as thick as bees and as ugly as bats.\r\n\r\n“The tomb of Juliet” is also a deception—a modern invention; but the\r\nhouse of Juliet’s parents (the Capuletti), an old palace, stands as it\r\ndid in the days when Shakspere represents its banqueting halls and good\r\ncheer.\r\n\r\nThe scenery from Verona to Florence, with the exception of a few views\r\nof the Apennines, is very tedious—nothing beyond almond orchards,\r\nwhich in March, the time of the year I saw them, resembled dead apple\r\ntrees. You will be surprised to hear that the Italian gentlemen wore\r\nfur on their coats. They were, I imagine, traveled gentlemen, for the\r\ngenuine Italian, whether count or beggar, has a cloak thrown over his\r\nshoulders in bewitching folds. When he pulls his large felt hat over\r\nhis magnificent eyes so that it casts a dark shadow over his mysterious\r\nface, and stands in the sunshine, he looks simply a picture.\r\n\r\nVerona is more Italian in appearance than Florence. The principal\r\nstreet runs along either side of the river Arno, and is crowded for\r\nsome distance with little picture and jewelry shops; but farther on\r\ntoward the _cascine_, or park, the street widens, and is enriched\r\nwith handsome modern buildings, most of which are hotels. This drive\r\nto the _cascine_ and the grand hotel was made when Victor Emmanuel\r\nallowed the impression to exist that Florence would remain the capital\r\nof Italy. This drive is thronged with carriages about four o’clock\r\nin the afternoon. It was here I remember to have had the carriage of\r\nthe Medici family pointed out to me. Within sat two ladies with dark,\r\nlustrous eyes, jet hair, and a great deal of lemon color on their\r\nbonnets. The livery was also lemon color, and the carriage contained\r\nthe coat of arms on a lemon-colored panel. The Italians are very\r\npartial to this shade of yellow. The beds are draped with material of\r\nthis same intense hue—very becoming to brunettes, but ruinous, as the\r\nyoung ladies would say, to blondes.\r\n\r\nEvery one knows of the old Palazzo Vecchio, which rises away above\r\nevery object in the city of Florence. Its walls are so thick that in\r\nthem there are places for concealment—little cells—and in one of these\r\nthe great reformer of Florence, Savonarola, was kept until they burned\r\nhim at the stake in front of the palace.\r\n\r\n“Santa Croce” is the name of the church which contains the tombs of\r\nMichael Angelo, Alfieri Galileo, and Machiavelli. Byron, moved with\r\nthis idea, writes:\r\n\r\n    “In Santa Croce’s holy precincts lie\r\n       Ashes which make it holier, dust which is\r\n     Even in itself an immortality.”\r\n\r\nEvery American goes to Powers’s studio to see the original of the\r\nGreek Slave. Next to the Venus of Milo it seems the loveliest study in\r\nmarble of the female figure. But “our lady of Milo,” as Hawthorne calls\r\nher—there is no beauty to hers!\r\n\r\nThe Baptistery in Florence is a curious octagonal church, built in\r\nthe twelfth century, and has the celebrated bronze doors by Ghiberti,\r\nrepresenting twelve eventful scenes from the Bible. Those to the south\r\nare beautiful enough, said Michael Angelo, to be the gates of paradise.\r\n\r\nAs often as I had reflected upon Rome and her seven hills, on arriving\r\nthere the hills seemed to be a new revelation to me, and the rapid\r\ndriving of the Italians up and down the steep and narrow streets\r\nbewildered me not a little. I found myself on the way from the depot,\r\nconstantly asking, can this be Rome? Everything looks so new. The\r\nhouses are light sandstone, like the buildings in Paris. I was\r\ninformed that this portion of Rome was calculated to mislead me, and\r\nthat I would find our hotel quite like Paris and New York houses. The\r\nnext morning, instead of making a pilgrimage to the Roman forum, the\r\nColosseum, and the palace of the Cæsars, we drove to St. Peter’s, which\r\nkept me still quite in the notion that Rome had been whitewashed, or\r\nsomething done to destroy her ancient classic aspect. We spent four\r\nhours in the great church wandering around and witnessing a procession\r\nof priests, monks, and gorgeous cardinals. There is no gewgaw, no\r\ntinsel in St. Peter’s as one sees in so many other Catholic churches;\r\nalthough gold is used in profusion, yet it is kept in subjection to\r\nthe tone of the walls. The bronze altar over St. Peter’s tomb is\r\nwonderfully effective in the way of concentrating color and attention.\r\nIt is almost necessary to find a niche in the base of some pillar and\r\nsit there awhile before plunging into the immensity of this great\r\nbuilding, just as a bird gets ready before darting into space. But\r\nafter all, the feeling of immensity which St. Peter’s gives is not so\r\ngrateful to the religious sense as the Gothic style of architecture,\r\nwith its stained window, and deep recesses,\r\n\r\n    “Its long drawn aisles and fretted vaults.”\r\n\r\nThere is little solemnity in St. Peter’s, little shade and no music,\r\nonly from side chapels; but there are grand proportions, perfect\r\nsimplicity, and the pure light of heaven sending a beam upon a golden\r\ndove above St. Peter’s tomb, which radiates in a thousand streams of\r\nlight over the marble pavement.\r\n\r\nNothing impressed me so much in Rome or suggested the ancient glory\r\nso much as the ruins of the Baths of Caracalla. The magnificence of\r\nthis building must have been unparalleled. It accommodated sixteen\r\nhundred bathers at once, and some of its walls are so thick one fears\r\nto estimate the depth. What would the old Romans have thought of the\r\nbuildings of the present generation, which fall down or burn up without\r\nmuch warning. Here is solid masonry standing since the year 212.\r\n\r\nThe different arches and columns of Rome constitute one of the most\r\nattractive features to almost every traveller. Let those who enjoy\r\nthem climb their steps or strain their eyes to decipher in a scorching\r\nItalian sun the dates, the seven golden candlesticks, the shew bread,\r\nand Aaron’s rod, on Titus’s arch for example. I shall wander off while\r\nthey are so occupied into the old capitol—into the room where Rienzi\r\nstood and exhorted the people to recover their ancient rights and into\r\nthe basement below where St. Paul was imprisoned.\r\n\r\nThe present king had just been crowned at that time. I saw the king and\r\nqueen in a procession where they were driving to gratify the people,\r\nand again we saw him unattended driving with his brother through the\r\ngrounds of the Borghese Villa. The carnival was forbidden that year\r\nin Rome on account of the death of the King and Pope, but there were\r\nout-croppings of it on the streets. The tinseled finery and humbug of\r\nit seem so incongruous in ancient classic Rome. I was glad to escape it.\r\n\r\nThe old Pantheon is too important in its history for any one to write\r\nof it, but I have always liked the following paragraph from James\r\nFreeman Clarke concerning it: “The Romans in this church, or temple,\r\nworshiped their own gods, while they allowed the Jews, when in Rome,\r\nto worship their Jewish god, and the Egyptians to worship the gods of\r\nEgypt, and when they admitted the people of a conquered state to become\r\ncitizens of Rome their gods were admitted with them; but in both cases\r\nthe new citizens occupied a subordinate position to the old settlers.\r\nThe old worship of Rome was free from idolatry. Jupiter, Juno, and\r\nthe others were not represented by idols. But there was an impassable\r\ngulf between the old Roman religion and modern Roman thought, and\r\nChristianity came to the Roman world not as a new theory but as a new\r\nlife, and now her churches stand by the side of the ruins of the Temple\r\nof Vesta and the old empty Pantheon.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTRICITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is it? and what some of its manifestations? The name was given to\r\nan occult, but everywhere present, property of material things. First\r\ndiscovered by the ancients in amber (Gr. _electron_) and brought into\r\nevidence by friction. It is generally spoken of as a highly elastic,\r\nimponderable fluid, or fluids, with which all matter is supposed to be\r\nin a greater or less degree charged. Though such fluids have never been\r\ndiscovered as entities, and their existence may be but imaginary, it\r\nwas asserted to account for facts that otherwise seemed inexplicable.\r\n\r\nDefinitions of electricity are at hand, and could be easily given; but\r\nthey do not define or accurately point out that which they designate.\r\nAll that can be said, with confidence, is that certain phenomena which\r\ncome within our observation suggest the presence of such fluids, and\r\nare not otherwise explained. The answer to the question, “What is it?”\r\nmust be the honest confession, we do not know. But, if ignorant of what\r\nit is, we may yet intelligently study its manifestations. The phenomena\r\nare not less capable of satisfactory discussion because the efficient\r\nagent producing them is unknown.\r\n\r\nThe theory of two imponderable fluids or electricities having strong\r\nattractive and repellant forces, is adopted because probable, and it\r\nhelps make the discussion intelligible.\r\n\r\nThe awakened interest now so widely felt in this branch of natural\r\nscience is more than just the desire to know what is knowable of the\r\nworld we live in. At first, and indeed for ages, only the curious\r\nstudied electricity, and practical men asked “_Cui bono?_” But in\r\nthe present century it has become an applied science. In no other\r\nfield have our studies of nature been more fruitful of discoveries\r\npractically affecting the multiform industries, and improving the\r\nrapidly advancing civilization of the age.\r\n\r\nSome of the skillful inventions for controlling and utilizing this\r\npower lying all about us will be mentioned hereafter.\r\n\r\nIt will be well first to state a few facts that are known and mostly\r\nestablished by experimental tests:\r\n\r\n(1) The earth, and all bodies on its surface, with the atmosphere\r\nsurrounding it, are charged with electricity of greater or less\r\npotency. This seems their permanent state, though in some cases, its\r\npresence is not easily detected.\r\n\r\n(2) In quantity or intensity it is very different in different bodies,\r\nas also in the same under different conditions. In some portions of\r\nvast objects, as the earth and its atmosphere, it accumulates, immense\r\ncurrents being poured into them, while others are perhaps to the same\r\nextent drained.\r\n\r\n(3) Through some bodies the subtle fluid may pass with but slight\r\nobstruction—and they are called _conductors_. In others the hindrance\r\nis greater, and we call them _insulators_. But the difference is only\r\nof degrees; as the best conductors offer some obstruction, and the most\r\nperfect insulators do not completely insulate. The metals, charcoal,\r\nwater, and most moist substances, as the earth and animal bodies, offer\r\nbut little resistance. The atmosphere, most kinds of glass, sulphur,\r\nindia rubber, vulcanite, shellac, and other resins, with dry silk and\r\ncotton, are our best insulators. Friction used to secure electrical\r\nmanifestations is the occasion rather than the cause of the electricity\r\nthus developed or set free. That it does not cause it, even in the\r\nsense that it causes heat is evident, since the quantity of electricity\r\nbears no proportion to the amount of friction used to produce it.\r\n\r\nThough, really, there are not several distinct kinds of electricity,\r\nas statical, dynamic, magnetic, frictional, and atmospheric, the\r\nnomenclature of the science is at least convenient, and will not\r\nmislead. It indicates the methods of production, and makes the\r\ndiscussion of the subject more intelligible. And then the electricity\r\ndeveloped or set free by the different methods of excitement, though of\r\nthe same kind, differs much in degree and intensity.\r\n\r\nWhat is called statical electricity is the condition of the subtle\r\nforce in a state of electrical quiescence; and all electricity in\r\nmotion, however excited by friction, heat, chemical action, or\r\notherwise, is dynamic.\r\n\r\nPerpetual modifications are taking place in electrical condition of all\r\nmatter, that when made apparent, at first may seem quite inexplicable.\r\nThe excited currents flow with amazing rapidity. Their actions and\r\nre-actions baffle our calculations, and the imagination itself is\r\nbewildered by their extent and complexity. Yet by electrical tests and\r\nlaboratory experiments, carefully employed, the laws of electricity are\r\nnow as well known as those of any other branch of physical science,\r\nand the phenomena, if more startling, are no more mysterious than the\r\nmanifestations of heat, light and gravitation.\r\n\r\nAtmospheric electricity is not different in kind from that brought into\r\nevidence by the methods of the experimenter in the laboratory, subject\r\nto his control, and much used in the arts and industries of life. The\r\nlightning that shineth from the one part under heaven to the other part\r\nunder heaven, a bright light in the cloud, is the same as the electric\r\nspark from the moderately charged receiver, when the positive and\r\nnegative poles are brought into contact—the same as the less intense\r\nspark excited by passing the hand rapidly over the fur on the cat’s\r\nback when the electrical conditions are favorable.\r\n\r\nThe storm cloud is a vast receiver and by induction becomes at times\r\nhighly charged with electricity. If the cloud is at rest, and the\r\nheated air grows moist, that which is known as sheet or heat lightning\r\nappears in frequent flashes. The imprisoned electricity leaps forth\r\nfrom the bosom or edge of the cloud, but as instantly gathers itself\r\nback to its source, and apparently without tension or force enough\r\nto crash through the atmosphere to any distant object. The flashes\r\nare unaccompanied by the noise of thunder, and may be but reflections\r\non the cloud from a source far beyond. We watch them without fear of\r\ndanger, and the subdued impression is that of the beautiful.\r\n\r\nAmidst the terrific grandeur of the violent thunder storm another form\r\nof lightning is seen; either the vivid flash that seems to envelop us,\r\nor zigzag, sometimes forked lines that dash across the cloud earthward,\r\nand occasionally, as in a return stroke, from the earth to the cloud.\r\n\r\nIn about the middle of the eighteenth century the identity of lightning\r\nwith electricity was fully ascertained, and since then the most sublime\r\nand startling phenomena of our thunder storms are better understood.\r\nUnder certain contingencies they must occur. Since the different\r\nclouds or portions of the same cloud are charged with different\r\nelectricities, positive and negative, when these by the winds are\r\nbrought near each other, or rolled together, fierce explosions follow,\r\nand great electrical changes take place in the clouds. Vast supplies\r\nof the imprisoned fiery fluid leap from strata to strata, or, if the\r\ndistance is not too great, and the earth is at the same time strongly\r\nelectrified, crash down to it through whatever sufficient conductors\r\nare found. If those not sufficient to receive and convey the charge\r\nbe in the path they are dashed aside; men and beasts are killed by\r\nthe shock, trees and other less perfect conductors are scattered in\r\nfragments.\r\n\r\nUsually the more prominent objects as masts of ships, trees, and\r\nbuildings are struck in the lightning’s course from the cloud, but\r\noccasionally those lowest down, near trees, and even in cellars receive\r\nthe shock. In these cases the current is probably from the earth,\r\nwhose electric condition is negative with respect to the clouds that\r\npass over it. In either case the opposite electricities that strongly\r\nattract each other, and whose concurrence produces the destructive\r\ndischarge near the earth’s surface are held apart by the stratum of air\r\nbetween them. When the attraction becomes too strong to be resisted by\r\nthe insulating medium they rush together, in their fiery embrace, the\r\nflash and concussion being in proportion to the intensity of the charge.\r\n\r\nDo lightning rods protect? Yes; but not perfectly. If properly\r\nconstructed, and of sufficient conducting capacity, they are a source\r\nof safety, and to discard them as useless is not wise.\r\n\r\nThe instances in which buildings provided with rods have been struck\r\ndo not prove them useless; or, as some say, that the rods do harm by\r\nattracting the lightning that they are unable to conduct to the earth\r\nwithout injury to the building. The point does not attract, but only\r\ncatches the electricity that sweeps over it. When violent shocks or\r\nexplosions occur the rod may be of little service. Its office is to\r\nprevent these by silently conducting the excess of electricity from\r\nthe air. The rod, rightly placed, conducts to the earth all it can,\r\nlessening the evil it does not entirely prevent. But all danger is not\r\nremoved. The position of the opposite poles in the immense battery may\r\nbe such as to give the stroke a horizontal direction, and far below the\r\npoint of the rod; such currents have been known to pass long distances\r\nthrough atmosphere and smite with destructive violence objects lying\r\nin their path. Against these lateral attacks rods above our roofs are\r\nprobably little or no protection. Still the more good conductors there\r\nare in any locality the less danger, as they prevent the accumulation\r\nof electricity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOACHERS IN ENGLAND.\r\n\r\nBy JAMES TURVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat surprising that none of our present-day novelists,\r\nlike Charles Reade or Thomas Hardy, who are always on the outlook\r\nfor romantic realism, whether it be in incident or in fact, have had\r\ntheir eyes directed to the rural poachers who abound in every shire.\r\nPoachers, though neither quite respectable members of the church\r\nnor of society, are more interesting characters than burglars or\r\nticket-of-leave men, who figure frequently in the novelist’s pages.\r\nAnd, very strange to say, it has been left to a lady to write the\r\nfirst accounts of poaching episodes, episodes remarkable for their\r\nmasculine touches and their wonderful grip of open-air reality; Harriet\r\nMartineau, in her “Forest and Game Law Tales,” astonishes us by her\r\ngraphic realism and her delicacy of treatment; Charles Kingsley wrote\r\none or two of his pathetic ballads on the subject of a poacher and\r\nhis wife; Norman Macleod made a Highland poacher the subject of a\r\ncharacter sketch; and in our own times Mr. Richard Jefferies, a writer\r\nwho finds pleasure in minute description and vivid realism, has in his\r\nown style of exact word-painting given us a pleasant book about his\r\nown experiences as an amateur poacher. But the real poacher, the rural\r\nvagabond, the parish character, the ne’er-do-weel, whose life is a\r\nliving protest against the game-laws, is of more lasting interest than\r\nany amateur can ever be.\r\n\r\nViewed from the serene vantage-ground of the philosophy of life,\r\npoaching is mean and ignoble, and demoralizing sport to you or me, and\r\nis not worth the powder and shot, while the fines and punishments are\r\nout of all proportion to the joys; yet there are not wanting apologists\r\nfor it in this apologetic century. “Poaching! Man, there’s no sin in\r\ncatching a rabbit or snaring a hare. They belong to naebody. Bless\r\nyou! it’s a gentleman’s trick, shooting.” This is the opinion of any\r\nNorthern lowland ploughman’s wife, as she looks from her red-tiled\r\ncottage-door out upon the face of the corn-growing mother earth, which\r\nhas given her sweet memories and a host of country neighbors and\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nSixty years ago peasants could use their guns without let or hindrance,\r\nand it was then a common thing for a farm-laborer to go out and have a\r\nshot when no sportsman was in the way. Taking an odd shot now and then\r\nwas never, and is not even now, looked upon by them as poaching. But a\r\nnoted poacher, nicknamed the Otter, tells me, with a sigh, “Poaching\r\nis not what it once was!” And it is true. Not so very long ago it\r\nwas a very profitable occupation, and comparatively respectable,\r\nbefore railways and telegraph wires and penny newspapers stereotyped\r\nmetropolitan ideas into all and sundry. An old farmer is pointed out as\r\nhaving made all his money by systematic poaching, and an influential\r\ncity official is said to have laid his early nest-egg by no other means\r\nthan being a good shot where he had no invitation to be. To-day even\r\nrural society would look down upon a young farmer engaged in poaching.\r\nIt is no longer sport to gentlemen, says the Otter, and is left to\r\nmoral vagabonds, the waifs and strays, the parish loafers. The great\r\nstrides of agriculture, the game-laws, and the artificial breeding of\r\ngame have driven it into sneaking ways, and robbed it of its robust\r\npicturesque adventures. To excel in it a man must give up his nights\r\nand days to it—in short, he must become a specialist, and even then it\r\nhardly pays.\r\n\r\nA genuine poacher has great force of character; he has a genius for\r\nfield and woodcraft. He is the eldest survivor of rustic romance. His\r\nwild life is tinged with the love of adventure, the love of moon and\r\nstars, the knowledge of the seasons, the haunts and habits of game, and\r\nthe power of trapping rabbits in dark woodland glades. No man knows\r\nmore intimately the night-side of Nature between the chilly hours\r\nof midnight and sunrise. In this cold-blooded age there are always\r\nsome Quixotic individuals, born in the outwardly sleepy villages and\r\nlifeless farmsteads, with the love of midnight adventure, who wage\r\nlong warfare against the game-laws, and who only knuckle under to the\r\nlaw’s severity when their health gives way or an enemy turns informer.\r\n“Rheumatics plays the mischief with poaching!” exclaims the Otter,\r\nreferring to the long night-watches in wet ditches and beside hedges\r\nfor hares on the lea fields. Irrespective of all thought of gain, there\r\nis an infatuation to eager spirits in this midnight sport. It appeals\r\nto strong, healthy, brave men. Charles Kingsley, in “The Bad Squire,”\r\nwith its strong sympathy and feeling, and its cry of “blood” on all the\r\nsquire owned, from the foreign shrub to the game he sold, gives us the\r\npoacher’s wife view, a view we are too apt to ignore or forget, with\r\nthe weary eyes and heavy heart, that grow light only with weeping, and\r\ngo wandering into the night. We forget too often that in the hearts of\r\ncommon folk there is the glamor of poetic romance about poaching, and a\r\nbitter hatred toward the game-laws. Like Rizpah’s son, many a lad has\r\nhad no other incentive than that “The farmer dared us to do it,” and\r\nthat he found it sweetened by the secret sympathy of the people. Too\r\noften, I fear, the game-laws dare a brave rustic into poaching: he has\r\nonly this one way left to satisfy the insatiable British thirst for\r\nfield sport. It is gravely whispered that some of the most striking\r\nmen have tasted its romance; and if all stories be true, the master of\r\nthe English drama owes to an unlucky deer-poaching incident the lucky\r\nturn in his career which sent him to London and to writing plays, and\r\npoachers may reasonably claim Shakspere as their patron saint.\r\n\r\nWhen the strong, sweet ale warms his heart, the poacher boasts of\r\ndreadful adventures in the night, of leaping broad mill-dams when\r\nchased, of giving fight in the dark, and discomfiting gamekeepers by\r\nclever tricks. He paints his exploits in such heroical glory, that\r\nthe seat next the fire in the ale-house is given him by admiring and\r\nfearing rustics. Honesty he ascribes to practicedness in the world’s\r\nways, and he looks upon keeping out of jail as the greatest victory\r\nthat man can achieve. He is the type of man that makes our best\r\nsoldiers, or, as he phrases it, is paid to stop the gun-shots. He\r\nrequires no almanac to tell him when the moon is to rise to-morrow,\r\nand he could give the gamekeepers lessons. He is to be envied for his\r\nquick feeling of life and his sympathy for field and forest sport, and\r\nthat wild exuberance of spirits which he seems to catch with his hares.\r\nIt is this rural vagabond—and not Mr. Commonplace Respectability—who\r\nrivets young folks’ attention; his energy anywhere would achieve\r\nsuccess; and he is free from that unpardonable fault, dulness. In the\r\nrustic drama of life he is the character that takes hold of us in our\r\nbest impulses—and is not that the best world of the ideal? He disdains\r\nto shoot starlings or black-birds; he is too much a sportsman to pay\r\nattention to such small game. He can put his hands to various ways\r\nof living; he can collect bird’s eggs, shoot wild rock-pigeons for\r\na farmers’ club, gather blackberries, or, as they say in Scotland,\r\n“brambles,” pull young ash-saplings in plantations, and sell them to\r\ngrooms in the livery stables in town.—_The Contemporary Review._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEIGHT CENTURIES WITH WALTER SCOTT.\r\n\r\nBy WALLACE BRUCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n“The burning sun of Syria had not yet attained its highest point in\r\nthe horizon, when a knight of the Red Cross, who had left his distant\r\nnorthern home, and joined the host of the Crusaders in Palestine, was\r\npacing slowly along the sandy deserts which lie in the vicinity of the\r\nDead Sea, or as it is called, the Lake Asphalites, where the waves of\r\nthe Jordan pour themselves into an inland sea, from which there is no\r\ndischarge of waters.”\r\n\r\nThis is the graphic opening of “The Talisman.” The steel clad pilgrim\r\nwas entering upon that great plain, once watered even as the Garden of\r\nthe Lord, now an arid and sterile wilderness, sloping away to the Dead\r\nSea, which hides beneath its sluggish waves the once proud cities of\r\nSodom and Gomorrah;—a dark mass of water “Which holds no living fish in\r\nits bosom, bears no skiff on its surface, and sends no tribute to the\r\nocean.” It was a scene of desolation still testifying to the just wrath\r\nof the Almighty. As in the days of Moses, “The whole land was brimstone\r\nand salt; it is not sown, nor beareth, nor any grass groweth thereon.”\r\nThe first sentence of the chapter revealed the descriptive and artistic\r\npower of the novelist, for the desolation is made more desolate by the\r\nintroduction of the solitary horseman, journeying slowly through the\r\nflitting sand, under the noontide splendor of the eastern sun.\r\n\r\nAlmost a century has passed since the triumph of the first crusade. The\r\nLatin Kingdom, founded by its leaders, had lasted only eighty-eight\r\nyears. Jerusalem is again in the hands of the Saracens. The crescent\r\ngleams on the Mosque of St. Omar. The cross has been torn from her\r\ntemples, her shrines profaned, and the worshipers of the Holy Sepulcher\r\nmurdered or exiled. The second crusade had been a failure, and its\r\nhistory a series of disasters. Thousands perished in the long march\r\nacross Asia Minor. Those who reached Palestine undertook the siege of\r\nDamascus, but the attempt was disastrous. In 1187 a powerful leader\r\nof the East appeared in the high-souled and chivalrous Saladin. By\r\nwise counsel he united the factions of the Mohammedans, which had\r\nbeen at variance for two hundred years; and on the arrival of the\r\nthird crusade, with which event we are now dealing, he was enabled to\r\npresent a solid front of warriors “like unto the sand of the desert in\r\nmultitude.”\r\n\r\nThe land, where “peace and good will to men” had been proclaimed by the\r\nvoices of angels, and emphasized by the blessed words of the Son of\r\nGod, was again converted into a vast tournament field for the armies of\r\nEurope and Asia: aye more, even in the mountain passes that guard the\r\nHoly City, the mission of the crusaders was sacrificed to petty insults\r\nand rivalries. Richard the Lion-hearted and King Philip of France were\r\nrepeating the old story of Achilles and Agamemnon. The military orders\r\nof the Knights of the Temple and the Knights of St. John, which had\r\ngrown up in Jerusalem, founded as fraternities devoted to works of\r\nmercy in behalf of poor pilgrims, had become powerful rivals of each\r\nother and the clergy, and by intrigue and dissension purposely fomented\r\nthe discord. According to the historian Michaud, “On the one side were\r\nthe French, the German, the Templars and the Genoese; on the other the\r\nEnglish, the Pisans, and the Knights of St. John.”\r\n\r\nThese are the historical circumstances with which Scott has to deal;\r\nand it is on a mission from such a council, made up of discordant\r\nfactions, convened during the sickness of Richard, that we find the\r\nKnight of the Red Cross, or as he is afterward styled, Kenneth the\r\nScot, bearing a message to the celebrated Hermit of Engaddi. His\r\nadventures by the way are as romantic as any recorded in the Knights\r\nof the Round-Table; for, as he directed his course toward a cluster of\r\npalm trees, he saw suddenly emerge therefrom a Saracen chief mounted\r\non a fleet Arabian horse. As they drew near each other they prepared\r\nfor battle, each after the manner of his own country. “On the desert,”\r\naccording to an Eastern proverb, “no man meets a friend.” The heavy\r\narmor of the crusader and his powerful horse are more than an even\r\nmatch for the wily Saracen. The Scottish knight might have been likened\r\nin the conflict to a bold rock in the sea, and the swift assaults\r\nof the Eastern warrior to the waves dashing against it only to be\r\nbroken into foam. After a long struggle, which was worthy of a larger\r\naudience, the Saracen calls a truce, and the Mohammedan and Christian,\r\nso lately in deadly conflict, make their way side by side, each\r\nrespecting the other’s courage, to the well under the clustered palms.\r\n\r\nThe student of history will find in the description of this\r\nhand-to-hand conflict an object-lesson of the garb and manners of the\r\nEastern and Western races; and will learn more in the conversation that\r\nfollows, as they partake of their scanty meal, of the sentiments and\r\ncustoms of the hostile races than can be gathered from the pages of any\r\nhistory with which I am acquainted: for Sir Walter had the marvelous\r\nfaculty of absorbing history. He saw everything so vividly that he was\r\nable to reproduce it in living forms. As we read his description, we\r\nsit with them under the palms; we hear them now responding in courtesy,\r\nand again in sharp discussion, as allusion is made to their respective\r\nreligions or modes of life; and, as they resume their journey, we feel\r\ngrateful to the novelist for the beautiful figure which he puts in\r\nthe mouth of the Scottish knight in answer to the Saracen’s boast of\r\nharem-life as contrasted with a Christian household.\r\n\r\n    “That diamond signet,” says the knight, “which thou\r\n    wearest on thy finger, thou holdest it doubtless of\r\n    inestimable value?” “Bagdad can not show the like,”\r\n    replied the Saracen; “But what avails it to our\r\n    purpose?” “Much,” replied the Frank, “as thou shalt\r\n    thyself confess. Take my war-axe and dash the stone\r\n    into twenty shivers; would each fragment be as valuable\r\n    as the original gem, or would they, all collected, bear\r\n    the tenth part of its estimation?”\r\n\r\n    “That is a child’s question,” answered the Saracen;\r\n    “the fragments of a stone would not equal the entire\r\n    jewel in the degree of hundreds to one.”\r\n\r\n    “Saracen,” replied the Christian warrior, “the love\r\n    which a true knight binds on one only, fair and\r\n    faithful, is the gem entire; the affection thou\r\n    flingest among thy enslaved wives, and half-wedded\r\n    slaves, is worthless, comparatively, as the sparkling\r\n    shivers of the broken diamond.”\r\n\r\nWe find both soldiers courteous in conversation, and their example\r\nteaches a good lesson to modern controversy; but the “courtesy of the\r\nChristian seemed to flow rather from a good natured sense of what was\r\ndue to others; that of the Moslem, from a high feeling of what was\r\nto be expected from himself. The manners of the Eastern warrior were\r\ngrave, graceful and decorous;” he might have been compared to “his\r\nsheeny and crescent-shaped saber, with its narrow and light, but bright\r\nand keen, Damascus blade, contrasted with the long and ponderous Gothic\r\nwar-sword which was flung unbuckled on the same sod.”\r\n\r\nThey pursue their march to the grotto of the Hermit of Engaddi; a man\r\nrespected alike by Christian and Mohammedan; revered by the Latins\r\nfor his austere devotion, and by the Arabs on account of his symptoms\r\nof insanity, which they ascribed to inspiration. The hermit, once\r\na crusader, was the man whom Kenneth was to meet. He delivers his\r\nmessage; but at night, while the Saracen slept, Kenneth is conducted to\r\na subterraneous, but elegantly carved chapel, where he meets by chance\r\nwith the noble sister of King Richard, who with Richard’s newly wedded\r\nwife, had come hither to pray for the king’s recovery. She drops a\r\nrose at the knight’s feet confirming the approbation which her smiles\r\nhad already expressed to him in camp, and the story of true love, not\r\ndestined to run smoothly, is fairly commenced. But as with “Count\r\nRobert of Paris,” “The Talisman” is not so much a romance as a picture\r\nof the strife and jealousy of haughty and rival leaders. Its value, as\r\na historical novel, lies in the portrayal of these discordant elements.\r\n\r\nWe may read the best history of the crusades, page by page, line by\r\nline, only to forget the next month, or the next year, everything save\r\nthe issue of the long struggle; but “The Talisman,” by its wondrous\r\nreality, makes a lasting impression upon our minds. We see Richard\r\ntossing upon his couch, impatient of his fever and protracted delays.\r\nWe see the Marquis of Montserrat, and the Grand Master of the Knights\r\nTemplar walking together in close-whispered conspiracy. We see Leopold,\r\nthe Grand Duke of Austria, lifting his own banner, with overweening\r\npride, by the side of England’s standard. We see Richard dashing aside\r\nthe attendants of his sick bed, half-clad, rushing forth to avenge the\r\ninsult, splintering the staff, and trampling upon the Austrian flag. We\r\nstand with Kenneth under the starlight, guarding alone the dignity of\r\nEngland’s banner, but decoyed away in an unlucky hour by the ring of\r\nKing Richard’s sister, which had been obtained by artifice. We see the\r\nflag stolen in that fatal absence, and the noble knight condemned to\r\ndeath, to be saved only by miracle from the fierce wrath of Richard. He\r\nis given as a present to the Arabian physician whose art had restored\r\nthe king to health. We see him again with Richard in the disguise\r\nof a Nubian slave. We see a strolling Saracen with poisoned dagger\r\nattempting the life of Richard, but saved by the faithful Kenneth. We\r\nfind Richard considering in his mind the giving of his royal sister\r\nin marriage to Saladin; an affair which fortunately needed the lady’s\r\nconsent, who had in her veins too much of the proud Plantagenet blood\r\nto know the meaning of compulsion. We see the tournament which decided\r\nthe treachery of Conrad, and the triumph of Kenneth, who turns out to\r\nbe no other than the Earl of Huntingdon, heir of the Scottish throne.\r\nThe comrade of Kenneth, and the physician who waited upon the king,\r\nchances to be the same person, and no less renowned a hero than the\r\nEmperor Saladin, who sends as a nuptial present to Kenneth and Edith\r\nPlantagenet the celebrated talisman by which he had wrought so many\r\nnotable cures; which, according to Scott, is still in existence in the\r\nfamily of Sir Simon of Lee.\r\n\r\nThis tale of the crusaders is so complete that we need after closing\r\nthe volume only a few lines of history to complete the record. The\r\ncity of Ptolemais was captured after a three years’ siege. More than\r\none hundred skirmishes and nine great battles were fought under its\r\nwalls. Both parties were animated by religious zeal. It is said\r\nthat the King of Jerusalem marched to battle with the books of the\r\nEvangelists borne before him; and that Saladin often paused upon the\r\nfield of battle to recite a prayer, or read a chapter from the Koran.\r\nPhilip finally returns to France. Richard remains in command of one\r\nhundred thousand soldiers. He conquers the Saracens in battle, repairs\r\nthe fortifications of Jaffa and Ascalon, but in the intoxication\r\nof pleasure forgets the conquest of Jerusalem. His victories were\r\nfruitless. He obtained from Saladin merely a truce of three years\r\nand eight months, “which insured to pilgrims the right of entering\r\nJerusalem untaxed,” and, without fulfilling his promise of striking\r\nhis lance against the gates of the Holy City, sets off on his homeward\r\njourney, to be taken captive and held a prisoner in a Tyrolese castle.\r\nIn brief the history of the Third Crusade is that of a house divided\r\nagainst itself.\r\n\r\nAs “The Betrothed” brought us back from Constantinople and Palestine\r\nto Merrie England, so “Ivanhoe” transports the reader, and some of\r\nthe prominent actors of the drama, from the eastern shores of the\r\nMediterranean to the pleasant district of the West Riding of Yorkshire,\r\nwatered by the river Don, “where flourished in ancient times those\r\nbands of gallant outlaws, whose deeds have been rendered so popular in\r\nEnglish song.”\r\n\r\nThe prominent historical features which Scott illustrates in the\r\nromantic story of “Ivanhoe” are the domestic and civil relations\r\nexisting between the Saxon and the Norman about the year 1196, when the\r\nreturn of Richard the First from Palestine and captivity was an event\r\nrather hoped for than expected; and an event _not_ hoped for by King\r\nJohn and his followers.\r\n\r\nThe Saxon spirit had been well nigh subdued by the strict and unjust\r\nlaws imposed by the Norman kings. For one hundred and thirty years\r\nNorman-French had been the language of the court, the language of law,\r\nof chivalry and justice. The laws of the chase and the curfew,—and\r\nmany others unknown to the Saxon constitution,—had been placed upon\r\nthe necks of the inhabitants of the soil. With few exceptions the race\r\nof Saxon princes had been extirpated; and it was not until the reign\r\nof Edward III. that England became thoroughly united as one people.\r\nThe English language at the close of the twelfth century was not yet\r\nborn. The Saxon mother and Norman father were not yet wedded; the two\r\nlanguages were gradually getting acquainted with each other; or, as\r\nScott has logically expressed it, “the necessary intercourse between\r\nthe lords of the soil, and those oppressed inferior beings by whom that\r\nsoil was cultivated, occasioned the formation of a dialect, compounded\r\nbetwixt the French and the Anglo-Saxon, in which they could render\r\nthemselves mutually intelligible to each other; and from this necessity\r\narose by degrees the structure of our present English language, in\r\nwhich the speech of the victors and the vanquished has been so happily\r\nblended together, and which has since been so richly improved by\r\nimportations from the classical languages, and from those spoken by\r\nthe southern nations of Europe.” In the first chapter—and it is always\r\nwell to read carefully the first chapter of Scott—we are introduced\r\nto a swine-herd, born thrall of Cedric of Rotherwood, one of the few\r\npowerful Saxon families existing in England at the time of our story.\r\nHe is attended by a domestic clown, or jester, maintained at that time\r\nin the houses of the wealthy. With an art and unity like Shakspere,\r\nScott emphasizes at the very outset the chief historic feature of his\r\nstory, by putting the following conversation in the mouths of these\r\nSaxon menials:\r\n\r\n    “How call you those grunting brutes running about on\r\n    their four legs?” demanded Wamba, the jester.\r\n\r\n    “Swine,” said the herd.\r\n\r\n    “And swine is good Saxon,” said the jester; “but how\r\n    call you it when quartered?”\r\n\r\n    “Pork,” answered the cow-herd.\r\n\r\n    “And pork,” said Wamba, “is good Norman-French; and\r\n    so when the brute lives, and is in the charge of a\r\n    Saxon slave, she goes by her Saxon name; but becomes a\r\n    Norman, and is called _pork_, when she is carried to\r\n    the castle-hall to feast among the nobles. Nay, I can\r\n    tell you more,” said Wamba, in the same tone, “there is\r\n    Alderman Ox, who continues to hold his Saxon epithet,\r\n    while he is under the charge of serfs and bondsmen such\r\n    as thou, but becomes _beef_, a fiery French gallant,\r\n    when he arrives before the worshipful jaws that are\r\n    destined to consume him. Mynheer Calf, too, becomes\r\n    Monsieur de _Veau_ in the like manner; he is Saxon when\r\n    he requires tendance, and takes a Norman name when he\r\n    becomes matter of enjoyment.”\r\n\r\nThe third chapter brings together a strange gathering under the roof\r\nof the hospitable Cedric: Brian de Bois Gilbert, a haughty Templar;\r\nPrior Aymer, of free and jovial character; a poor Palmer, just returned\r\nfrom the Holy Land, and a Jew known as Isaac of York; all journeying\r\non their way to a tournament to be held a few miles distant at Ashby\r\nde la Zouche. Lady Rowena, descended from the noble line of Alfred,\r\ngraced the table with her presence, a ward destined by Cedric, but not\r\nby fate, to be the wife of Athelstane,—a Saxon descended from Edward\r\nthe Confessor: in the furtherance of which idea his only son had been\r\nexiled, when it became known that he aspired to the hand of the Saxon\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\nAt the tournament the remaining characters of the drama are introduced:\r\nKing John, with his retinue; Richard the Lion-Hearted, under the\r\ndisguise of the “Black Knight;” Rebecca, the Jewess; the proud baron\r\nFront de Bœuf; Robin Hood, the brave outlaw, under the name of Loxley;\r\nand Ivanhoe, the poor pilgrim, who wins the prize at the tournament\r\nand crowns Rowena Queen of Beauty. At the close of the second day’s\r\ntournament, in which Ivanhoe is again successful, a letter is handed\r\nto King John with the brief sentence, “Take heed to yourself, for\r\nthe devil is unchained.” It was like the handwriting on the wall of\r\nBelshazzar’s palace, and proclaimed the end of his kingdom.\r\n\r\nCedric, Rowena, Isaac, Rebecca, Athelstane and Ivanhoe depart their\r\nseveral ways from the tournament, but are captured and taken to Front\r\nde Bœuf’s castle. Cedric escapes in the guise of a monk. The castle is\r\nstormed, and now occurs one of the most dramatic pictures in the pages\r\nof romantic literature, destined to reveal to all time the undying\r\nhate between the Saxon and the Norman. A Saxon woman, by name Ulrica,\r\nhad lived for years in Front de Bœuf’s castle. She had seen her father\r\nand seven brothers killed in defending their home, but she “remained\r\nto administer ignominiously to the murderers of her family. She used\r\nthe seductions of her beauty to arm the son against the father; she\r\nheated drunken revelry into murderous broil, and stained with a\r\nparricide the banqueting hall of the conquerors.” She had sold body\r\nand soul to obtain revenge for Norman cruelties; and now, grown old\r\nin servitude, incensed by the contempt of her masters, she determines\r\nupon a deed, which will make the ears of men tingle while the name of\r\nSaxon is remembered. She fires the castle and appears on a turret in\r\nthe guise of one of the ancient furies, yelling forth a war-song. “Her\r\nlong, dishevelled grey hair flows back from her uncovered head; the\r\ninebriated delight of gratified vengeance contends in her eyes with the\r\nfire of insanity; and she brandishes the distaff which she holds in her\r\nhand, as if she were one of the fatal sisters, who spin and abridge\r\nthe thread of human life. At length, with a terrific crash, the whole\r\nturret gives way, and she perishes in the flames which consume her\r\ntyrant.”\r\n\r\nThere is another historic feature of the times emphasized in this\r\nromance: the oppression of the Jews in England during these cruel and\r\nadventurous times. The character of the race is vividly portrayed in\r\nIsaac of York, in which masterly delineation Scott seems truer to\r\nnature than Shakspere in the character of Shylock. Rebecca, his noble\r\nand beautiful daughter, is the type of all that is pure and womanly.\r\nHer words have the eloquence of the poets and prophets of old: “Know\r\nproud knight,” she says, “we number names amongst us to which your\r\nboasted Northern nobility is as the gourd compared with the cedar—names\r\nthat ascend far back to those high times when the Divine Presence shook\r\nthe mercy seat between the cherubim, and which derive their splendor\r\nfrom no earthly prince, but from the awful Voice, which bade their\r\nfathers be nearest of the congregation to the vision; such were the\r\nprinces of the house of Jacob; now such no more. They are trampled down\r\nlike the shorn grass, and mixed with the mire of the ways; yet there\r\nare those among them who shame not such high descent, and of such shall\r\nbe the daughter of Isaac, the son of Adonikam. Farewell! I envy not\r\nthy blood-won honors; I envy not thy barbarous descent from northern\r\nheathens; I envy not thy faith, which is ever in thy mouth, but never\r\nin thy heart nor in thy practice.”\r\n\r\nThe description of Friar Tuck entertaining King Richard in disguise\r\nis in Scott’s happiest vein; and Robin Hood, with his bold outlaws,\r\nshares the honors gracefully with knights and nobles. But it is alike\r\nunnecessary and unprofitable to attempt a condensation of “Ivanhoe.”\r\nNo outline can convey the beauty of a finished picture. It is not to\r\nbe taken at second hand. It is only for us to indicate its relation\r\nto history; and it will suffice to say that King Richard was gladly\r\nwelcomed by the English people, and that Ivanhoe was wedded to the\r\nbeautiful Rowena.\r\n\r\nBut, do I hear the reader ask, what becomes of the fair Jewess? Scott\r\nhas answered the question so beautifully in his preface that I borrow\r\nhis own words—a passage to my mind unsurpassed in English prose: “The\r\ncharacter of the fair Jewess found so much favor in the eyes of some\r\nfair readers, that the writer was censured, because, when arranging the\r\nfates of the characters of the drama, he had not assigned the hand of\r\nWilfred to Rebecca, rather than the less interesting Rowena. But, not\r\nto mention that the prejudices of the age rendered such an union almost\r\nimpossible, the author may, in passing, observe, that he thinks a\r\ncharacter of a highly virtuous and lofty stamp, is degraded rather than\r\nexalted by an attempt to reward virtue with temporal prosperity. Such\r\nis not the recompense which Providence has deemed worthy of suffering\r\nmerit, and it is a dangerous and fatal doctrine to teach young persons,\r\nthe most common readers of romance, that rectitude of conduct and of\r\nprinciple are either naturally allied with, or adequately rewarded\r\nby, the gratification of our passions, or attainment of our wishes.\r\nIn a word, if a virtuous and self-denied character is dismissed with\r\ntemporal wealth, greatness, rank, or the indulgence of such a rashly\r\nformed or ill-assorted passion as that of Rebecca for Ivanhoe, the\r\nreader will be apt to say, ‘Verily, virtue has had its reward.’ But\r\na glance on the great picture of life will show that the duties of\r\nself-denial and the sacrifice of passion to principle are seldom thus\r\nremunerated; and that the internal consciousness of their high-minded\r\ndischarge of duty produces on their own reflections a more adequate\r\nrecompense in the form of that peace which the world can not give or\r\ntake away.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT ORGAN AT FRIBOURG.\r\n\r\nBy EDITH SESSIONS TUPPER.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter thoroughly “doing” Berne in most approved guide-book fashion;\r\nfeeding the bears—hot, dusty looking creatures; standing in the middle\r\nof the street, heads thrown back at the risk of dislocating our necks\r\nto watch the celebrated clock strike, we stand one evening on the hotel\r\nterrace and take our farewell look at the Bernese Alps. Sharply defined\r\nagainst a sunset-flushed sky, as if cut from alabaster, glittering\r\nfair and white like the pinnacles and domes of a city celestial, rise\r\nthe Mönch, Eiger, Wetterhorn, and, serene and august in her icy virgin\r\nbeauty, the Jungfrau.\r\n\r\n    “Too soon the light began to fade,\r\n       Tho’ lingering soft and tender;\r\n     And the snow giants sank again\r\n       Into their calm dead splendor.”\r\n\r\nLeaving Berne, we take our way to Fribourg, to see its wonderful\r\ngorges and skeleton bridges, and hear its more wonderful organ. On\r\nour arrival at this quaint old Romanesque town, we are driven to the\r\nmost delightful little hotel, hanging on the very edge of the great\r\nravine, upon the sides of which the town is built. Through the more\r\nclosely-built region of the town runs the old stone wall with its high\r\nwatch-towers. Spanning the great gulf are the bridges—mere phantoms of\r\nbridges they seem from our windows. A dreary, drizzling rain sets in\r\nsoon after we arrive, and some American lads across the court-yard from\r\ntime to time send forth in their sweet untrained voices the refrain of\r\nthat mournful ballad, the “Soldier’s Farewell,”\r\n\r\n    “Farewell, farewell, my own true love.”\r\n\r\nA prevalent tone of _heimweh_ is in the air; eyes are filling, and\r\nmemory is stretching longing hands over the ocean, when fortunately\r\ncomes the summons to _table d’hote_. At our plates we find programs\r\nin very bad English of a concert to be given this evening upon the\r\ngreat organ in the cathedral. Thither we go at dusk, pausing a moment\r\nto look at the grotesque carving of the last judgment over the great\r\ndoor. Thereon the good, with most satisfied faces, are being admitted\r\nto heaven by St. Peter, a stout old gentleman in a short gown, jingling\r\na bunch of keys; while the wicked are being carried in Swiss baskets\r\nto a great cauldron over a blazing fire, therein to be deposited, and\r\nto be stirred up by devils armed with pitchforks for that purpose.\r\nWe enter. Without, the ceaseless drip of the rain; within, gloom,\r\ndarkness—save for the never-ceasing light before the altar, decay.\r\nThe air is chill and damp. Around us stretch dark, shadowed aisles.\r\nTombs of those long dust are on every hand. The air seems peopled with\r\nghosts. We are seated, and patiently wait for life to be breathed\r\ninto that mighty monster looming up in the darkness, above our heads.\r\nSuddenly, with a crash that shakes the building, the organ speaks.\r\nSilenced, overwhelmed, we listen, possessing our souls in patience for\r\nthe “Pastorale,” representing a thunder storm among the Alps, which\r\nis to close the evening’s entertainment. We have but recently come\r\nfrom the everlasting hills, and our souls are still under their magic\r\nenchantment. At last the moment comes. A pause, and there steals upon\r\nthe ear a light, sweet refrain. It is spring, the old, ideal spring;\r\nthe trees are budding; flowers are smiling from the meadows; we feel\r\nwarm south winds blowing; afar in the woods we hear the sylvan pipe of\r\nthe shepherd and the songs of birds. A peace is upon everything. Nature\r\nis calm, happy, and full of promise of glad fruition. To this succeeds\r\na languid, dreary strain—it is a drowsy summer afternoon. A delicious\r\nlanguor pervades the air; we hear the trees whispering to each other\r\nof their perfect foliage; we hear the laughing waters leaping and\r\ncalling to each other through their rocky passes; the flocks are asleep\r\nin the shade; the shadows are stealing and playing over the sides of\r\nthe mountains, and the whole world swims in a misty, golden haze. Now\r\nlisten closely. Do not we catch the mutter of distant thunder? And\r\nagain, do not we hear that clear, bell-like bird-call for rain? The\r\ndistant muttering grows louder, a stronger breeze sways the trees;\r\nstill we hear distinctly that bird-call. Now louder rolls the thunder,\r\nthe wind has arisen, the trees are bending to meet it, and in rage\r\nare tossing their boughs to the overcast sky; and ah! here comes the\r\nrain. Patter, patter, at first, now fast and faster, and now with a mad\r\nrush down it comes in one tremendous, outpouring sheet, and now with a\r\nterrific rumble and crash,\r\n\r\n    “From peak to peak the rattling crags among,\r\n       Leaps the live thunder:\r\n       Not from one lone cloud,\r\n     But every mountain now hath found a tongue,\r\n       And Jura answers from her misty shroud\r\n       Back to the joyous Alps who call on her aloud.”\r\n\r\nThe wind shrieks and howls, and yet above all this tumult and roar of\r\nthe elements, clearly and unmistakably rings that sweet flute-like\r\nbird-call. The storm rages, spends its fury, and dies away, and from a\r\nneighboring cloister come the voices of an unseen choir, raising a “Te\r\nDeum” to him who holds the storms in his hands. Silently we rise and\r\ngo, a great peace upon us, for divine notes from the soul of the organ\r\nhave entered into ours.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIT is not the nature of man to be always moving forward; it has its\r\ncomings and goings. Fever has its cold and hot fits, and the cold\r\nshiver proves the height of the fever quite as much as the hot fit.\r\nThe inventions of man from age to age proceed much in the same way.\r\nThe good nature and the malice of the world in general have the same\r\nebbs and flows. “Change of living is generally agreeable to the\r\nrich.”—_Pascal._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nECCENTRIC AMERICANS.\r\n\r\nBy COLEMAN E. BISHOP.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.—THE STATESMAN IN A STATE OF NATURE.\r\n\r\nDavid Crockett was born in the wilds of Tennessee, August 17, 1786. He\r\ntoughened rapidly, like a bear’s cub, but he showed in addition to the\r\nusual woodsman’s instincts the unusual qualities of great tenderness\r\nof feeling and generosity, with a remarkable gift of wit and love of\r\nfun. The incredible stories of his hardships at the age of twelve and\r\nthereafter we have not room to recount. In the best sense he was a\r\ntough boy. The closing scene of his home life—if a hut presided over\r\nby a drunken father, and a mother who left no impression on the boy’s\r\ncharacter that showed itself in after years can be by any courtesy\r\ncalled a home—was a dissolving view of a ragged, bare-footed urchin of\r\nfourteen chased through the brush by a father with a large goad and a\r\nlarge load of liquor. Thus David Crockett set out upon the world for\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nWith Crockett’s story as a bear-hunter, nomadic woodsman, soldier and\r\nIndian-fighter, exciting and marvelous as are these incidents of the\r\nfirst thirty years of his life, we shall not much concern ourselves.\r\nBut I do wonder that his life-like, quaint narrative of these has not\r\nbecome standard juvenile literature, along with Robinson Crusoe and\r\nMayne Reid’s stories of adventure. Through all these exciting though\r\nisolated years, the young woodsman picked up a good deal of practical\r\nknowledge, not one scrap of which he ever forgot; and withal was\r\ndeveloping a strange quality of unpretentious self-esteem. “The idea\r\nseemed never to have entered his mind that there was any one superior\r\nto David Crockett, or any one so humble that Crockett was entitled to\r\nlook down upon him with condescension. He was a genuine democrat, and\r\nall were in his view equal. And this was not the result of thought, of\r\nany political or moral principle. It was a part of his nature, like his\r\nstature or complexion. This is one of the rarest qualities to be found\r\nin any man.”[H]\r\n\r\nHe also was developing oratorical powers. He acquired unbounded\r\npopularity at musters and frolics, in camp and in the chase by his\r\nfun-making qualities, his homely, kindly, keen wit. His retentive\r\nmemory was an inexhaustible store-house of anecdote, and he always had\r\nan apt illustration for any point he wanted to make. He began to taste\r\nthe sweet consciousness of power over his fellows, and to easily fall\r\ninto the position of leadership, for which nature designed him.\r\n\r\nHis first official position came to him at about the age of thirty.\r\nThere were a good many outlaws in the region where he at that time had\r\nhis cabin and claim, and society began to cohere for self-protection.\r\nThe settlers convened and appointed Crockett and others to be justices\r\nof the peace, and a corps of stalwart young men to be constables.\r\nThese justices were really provost-marshals in power. There were no\r\nstatute laws nor courts; but there was authority enough, and Crockett\r\nsays everybody made laws according to his own notions of right. For\r\nshooting and appropriating a hog running at large, for instance, the\r\nsentence was to strip the thief, tie him to a tree and give him a\r\nflogging, burn down his cabin and drive him out of the country. Soon\r\nafter, the new territory was organized into counties and Crockett was\r\nregularly commissioned a justice by the legislature. His account of his\r\nadministration is interesting:\r\n\r\n    “I was made a squire according to law; though now the\r\n    honor rested on me more heavily than before. For, at\r\n    first, whenever I told my constable, says I, ‘catch\r\n    that fellow and bring him up for trial!’ away he\r\n    went, and the fellow must come, dead or alive. For we\r\n    considered this a good warrant, though it was only in\r\n    _verbal writing_. But after I was appointed by the\r\n    Assembly, they told me my warrants must be in _real_\r\n    writing and signed; and that I must keep a book and\r\n    write my proceedings in it. This was a hard business\r\n    on me, for I could just barely write my own name. But\r\n    to do this, and write the warrants too, was at least\r\n    a huckleberry over my persimmon. I had a pretty well\r\n    informed constable however, and I told him when he\r\n    should happen to be out anywhere and see that a warrant\r\n    was necessary and would have a good effect, he needn’t\r\n    take the trouble to come all the way to me to get one,\r\n    but he could just fill one out, and then on the trial\r\n    I could correct the whole business if he had committed\r\n    any error. In this way I got on pretty well, till by\r\n    care and attention I improved my handwriting in such a\r\n    manner as to be able to prepare my warrants and keep my\r\n    record books without much difficulty. My judgments were\r\n    never appealed from: and if they had been they would\r\n    have stuck like wax, as I gave my decisions on the\r\n    principles of common justice and honesty between man\r\n    and man, and relied on natural born sense, and not on\r\n    law learning, to guide me; for I had never read a page\r\n    in a law-book in all my life.”\r\n\r\nCrockett made his first stump speech when he was about thirty-four\r\nyears old. A militia regiment was to be organized, and a Captain\r\nMathews, after promising Crockett the majority of the regiment if he\r\nwould support him for its colonel, turned against Crockett in favor of\r\nhis own son. At a great muster prepared by Mathews, he made a stump\r\nspeech in his own and his son’s favor. Crockett, entirely unabashed,\r\nmounted the stump as soon as Mathews finished, and on the captain’s own\r\ngrounds proceeded to expose his duplicity and argue the total unfitness\r\nof both him and his son for the command. The speech was fluent,\r\nwitty, full of anecdote, and carried the rude audience by storm. It\r\neffectually beat both father and son. The fame of this maiden effort\r\ntraveled fast in a community where oratory was the great, if not the\r\nonly engine of popular control, and the result was that a committee\r\nsoon waited on Crockett and asked him to stand for the legislature then\r\nabout to be elected (1821). Some of his first electioneering adventures\r\nillustrate the frankness and tact so queerly combined in him, and also\r\nshow how he got his education in politics. Hickman county wanted to\r\nchange its county seat. He says: “Here they told me that they wanted to\r\nmove their town nearer to the center of the county, and I must come out\r\nin favor of it. I did not know what this meant, or how the town was to\r\nbe moved, and so I kept dark, going on the same identical plan that I\r\nnow find is called _non-committal_.”\r\n\r\nOn one occasion the candidates for governor of the State, Congress,\r\nand several for legislature, some of them able stump-speakers, were\r\nannounced. As he listened, a sense of inferiority for the first time,\r\nprobably, penetrated him; he drank in all they said, and remembered it.\r\nHe says:\r\n\r\n    “The thought of having to make a speech made my knees\r\n    feel mighty weak, and set my heart to fluttering almost\r\n    as bad as my first love scrape with the Quaker’s niece.\r\n    But as luck would have it, these big candidates spoke\r\n    nearly all day, and when they quit the people were worn\r\n    out with fatigue, which afforded me a good apology for\r\n    not discussing the government. But I listened mighty\r\n    close to them, and was learning pretty fast about\r\n    political matters. When they were all done I got up and\r\n    told some laughable story and quit.”\r\n\r\nHe was elected, and in the legislature proved a good story-teller, a\r\nformidable antagonist in repartee, and above all a good listener. He\r\nsays the first thing that he took pains to learn was the meaning of the\r\nwords “judiciary” and “government,” as up to that time he had “never\r\nheard that there was any such thing in all nature as a judiciary.” The\r\nhalls of the Tennessee legislature were again brightened in 1823-24 by\r\nthe wit and good sense of “the gentleman from the cane” as an opponent\r\nderisively dubbed him, very much to his subsequent regret.\r\n\r\nCrockett was now so well known that he was put forward for Congress.\r\nHis rapid advancement staggered even his self-sufficiency, and\r\nhe objected, saying he “knowed nothing about Congress matters.”\r\nFortunately, perhaps, he was given time to learn more, for he was\r\nbeaten at the polls this time. It was claimed by his supporters the\r\nresult was obtained by fraud, and as the adverse majority was small, he\r\nwas urged to contest the election; but he declined, saying he did not\r\ncare enough for office to take it unless the clearly expressed will of\r\nthe people called him thereto. From hunting for men he turned with zest\r\nto hunting for bears; his endurance, hardihood and success, and the\r\nnever-failing benevolence with which he divided the fruits of the hunt\r\nwith poor settlers, or lent a helping hand in many other ways, made him\r\nmore political capital than the best stump speeches could have done. He\r\nkilled one hundred and five bears one season. Two years later (1827)\r\nhe ran for Congress again and was triumphantly elected over two strong\r\nopponents. Thus the bear-hunting, Indian-fighting “gentleman from the\r\ncane,” barely able to write his name, so poor that he had to borrow\r\nmoney to pay his traveling expenses to Washington, became a law-maker\r\nof a great nation by sheer force of native talent and goodness of heart.\r\n\r\nHis fame preceded him to Washington. His prowess in arms, his dexterity\r\nin politics, and his quaint wit had been in the papers; all his sayings\r\nhad been, as is the style of American journalism, exaggerated and\r\nembellished and distorted, until the general impression of him was that\r\nof a coarse, outlandish, swaggering yahoo. His appearance in Washington\r\ndispersed these illusions thence, but the misrepresentations did not\r\ncease in the prints. As in the case of Lincoln, every profane and\r\nvulgar thing that cheap wit could invent was attributed to Crockett,\r\nand received as his. Many of these false impressions survive to this\r\nday; it is therefore proper here to give a picture of the man as he\r\nwas seen at home. It is thus reported by an intelligent gentleman who\r\nvisited his cabin just after his election. The visitor penetrated to\r\nCrockett’s cabin eight miles through unbroken wilderness by a path\r\nblazed on the trees. He says:\r\n\r\n    Two men were seated on stools at the door, both in\r\n    their shirt-sleeves, engaged in cleaning their rifles.\r\n    As the stranger rode up, one of the men came forward\r\n    to meet him. He was dressed in very plain homespun\r\n    attire, with a black fur cap upon his head. He was\r\n    a finely proportioned man, about six feet high,\r\n    apparently forty-five years of age, and of very frank,\r\n    pleasing, open countenance. He held his rifle in his\r\n    hand, and from his right shoulder hung a bag made of\r\n    raccoon-skin, to which there was a sheath attached\r\n    containing a large butcher-knife.\r\n\r\n    “This is Colonel Crockett’s residence, I presume,” said\r\n    the stranger.\r\n\r\n    “Yes,” was the reply, with a smile as of welcome.\r\n\r\n    “Have I the pleasure of seeing that gentleman before\r\n    me?” the stranger added.\r\n\r\n    “If it be a pleasure,” was the courteous reply, “you\r\n    have, sir.”\r\n\r\n    “Well, Colonel,” responded the stranger, “I have ridden\r\n    much out of my way to spend a day or two with you, and\r\n    take a hunt.”\r\n\r\n    “Get down, sir,” said the Colonel, cordially. “I am\r\n    delighted to see you. I like to see strangers. And the\r\n    only care I have is that I can not accommodate them as\r\n    well as I could wish. I have no corn, but my little boy\r\n    will take your horse over to my son-in-law’s. He is a\r\n    good fellow, and will take care of him.”\r\n\r\n    Leading the stranger into his cabin, Crockett very\r\n    courteously introduced him to his brother, his wife,\r\n    and his daughters. He then added:\r\n\r\n    “You see we are mighty rough here. I am afraid you will\r\n    think it hard times. But we have to do the best we can.\r\n    I started mighty poor, and have been rooting ’long ever\r\n    since. But I hate apologies. What I live upon always, I\r\n    think a friend can for a day or two. I have but little,\r\n    but that little is as free as the water that runs. So\r\n    make yourself at home.”\r\n\r\nHe seemed to have a great horror of binding himself to any man or\r\nparty. “I will pledge myself to no administration,” he said. “When\r\nthe will of my constituents is known, that will be my law; when it\r\nis unknown my own judgment shall be my guide.” So clear and lofty an\r\nidea had this unlearned man formed of the duties of a representative!\r\nWell for the country if as high a standard of political duty even now\r\nprevailed among the best and wisest legislators!\r\n\r\nNothing is recorded of his first term in Congress except that he\r\n“brought down the house” every time he spoke, and once so discomfited a\r\ncolleague that a duel was talked of; upon which Crockett gave out that\r\nif any one challenged him he should select as their weapons _bows and\r\narrows_.\r\n\r\nHe was re-elected in 1829. This was the Jackson tidal wave—the\r\ninauguration of that craze of hero-worship and spoils-grabbing which\r\nentailed its curse upon our politics, even to this day. During this\r\nterm came the turning point in Crockett’s career and a triumphant test\r\nof the strength of his character. At first he supported Jackson’s\r\nadministration and acted with the party. But when that “constitutional\r\ndemocrat” blossomed out into an unconstitutional autocrat, one man of\r\nhis party was found manly enough to act upon his own convictions. One\r\nof these unconstitutional measures was an act to vote half a million\r\nof dollars for disbursements made without color of law, and Crockett\r\nopposed it. The result is best told in his own words:\r\n\r\n    “Soon after the commencement of this second term, I\r\n    saw, or thought I did, that it was expected of me that\r\n    I would bow to the name of Andrew Jackson, and follow\r\n    him in all his motions, and mindings, and turnings,\r\n    even at the expense of my conscience and judgment.\r\n    Such a thing was new to me, and a total stranger to\r\n    my principles. I know’d well enough, though, that if\r\n    I didn’t ‘hurrah’ for his name, the hue and cry was\r\n    to be raised against me, and I was to be sacrificed,\r\n    if possible. His famous, or rather I should say his\r\n    _infamous_ Indian bill was brought forward, and I\r\n    opposed it from the purest motives in the world.\r\n    Several of my colleagues got around me, and told me how\r\n    well they loved me, and that I was ruining myself. They\r\n    said this was a favorite measure of the President, and\r\n    I ought to go for it. I told them I believed it was a\r\n    wicked, unjust measure, and that I should go against\r\n    it, let the cost to myself be what it might; that I\r\n    was willing to go with General Jackson in everything I\r\n    believed was honest and right; but, further than this,\r\n    I wouldn’t go for him or any other man in the whole\r\n    creation.\r\n\r\n    “I had been elected by a majority of three thousand\r\n    five hundred and eighty-five votes, and I believed they\r\n    were honest men, and wouldn’t want me to vote for any\r\n    unjust notion, to please Jackson or any one else; at\r\n    any rate, I was of age, and determined to trust them.\r\n    I voted against this Indian bill, and my conscience\r\n    yet tells me that I gave a good, honest vote, and one\r\n    that I believe will not make me ashamed in the day\r\n    of judgment. I served out my term, and though many\r\n    amusing things happened, I am not disposed to swell my\r\n    narrative by inserting them.\r\n\r\n    “When it closed, and I returned home, I found the storm\r\n    had raised against me sure enough; and it was echoed\r\n    from side to side, and from end to end of my district,\r\n    that I had turned against Jackson. This was considered\r\n    the unpardonable sin. I was hunted down like a wild\r\n    varment, and in this hunt every little newspaper in\r\n    the district, and every little pin-hook lawyer was\r\n    engaged. Indeed, they were ready to print anything\r\n    and everything that the ingenuity of man could invent\r\n    against me.”\r\n\r\nIt proved as he had anticipated; he failed of re-election, but only by\r\na majority of seventy votes. Two years of bear-hunting followed, during\r\nwhich Crockett thirsted for the nobler pursuit of ambition of which he\r\nhad had a taste. Some of his predictions as to Jackson’s course had\r\nbeen verified, and many things conspired to open his constituents’\r\neyes to the high character of their representative’s course. In the\r\ncanvass of 1833 he was elected the third time, winning one of the\r\nmost remarkable political triumphs ever known in this country. He had\r\nagainst him all the education, talent and wealth of his district; the\r\nadministration made it a test vote, and all that promises of reward,\r\nthreats of punishment, political and social, unlimited money, the\r\ninfluence of the national banks, and every appliance that the most\r\ntyrannical disposition ever dominant in our affairs could bring to bear\r\nwere used. Men of genius, eloquence, influence and fortune rode the\r\ndistrict; whiskey was free as water. The entire press opposed Crockett\r\nwith the ingenuity and abandon which only “patronage” can inspire.\r\nMore than all this the common people of the district, with whom lay\r\nCrockett’s influence, if he had any, worshiped “Old Hickory,” under\r\nwhom many of them had fought. Against these odds the impoverished,\r\nuneducated hunter, with no aid but his natural gifts and a clean\r\nrecord, canvassed the district of seventeen counties and 100,000\r\ninhabitants and won. This remarkable victory in Jackson’s own State,\r\nwhen his popularity was at its height, gave Crockett a new and better\r\ntitle to respect than any he had before presented; and it increased\r\nthe mystery hanging about this strange, uncultured genius. The world\r\nabandoned its preconceived notions of the back-woodsman when it saw his\r\npower; but it was at loss to conceive a true idea of him.\r\n\r\nDuring this session of Congress (1833-34) Crockett wrote his\r\nautobiography. As might be expected, it is a very unique work. Its\r\nstyle is simple and vigorous; the language is Shaksperian in its\r\nmonosyllables and short sentences, but the _ensemble_ is graphic, and\r\nas the events narrated are of the most extraordinary kind, it makes\r\nvery exciting reading. On the title page appears his famous motto:\r\n\r\n    “I leave these words for others when I’m dead;\r\n     Be always sure you’re right, then GO AHEAD!”\r\n\r\nCrockett submitted the manuscript of this work to a critic for\r\nrevision; but he declared afterward that the reviser had not improved\r\nthe work—probably because he toned down its vigorous language. Such\r\nexpressions as “my son and me went,” occur, and spelling like this:\r\n“hawl,” “tuff,” “scaffled,” “clomb” (for climbed); “flower” (for\r\nflour). But he positively objected to some of the orthographical\r\ncorrections, as he said “such spelling was contrary to nature.” He\r\nbrought the narrative of his life up to the date, and concluded it as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    “I am now here in Congress, this 28th day of January,\r\n    in the year of our Lord 1834; and, what is more\r\n    agreeable to my feelings, as a free man. I am at\r\n    liberty to vote as my conscience and judgment dictate\r\n    to be right, without the yoke of any party on me or the\r\n    driver at my heels with the whip in hand commanding\r\n    me to ‘gee-wo-haw!’ just at his pleasure. Look at my\r\n    arms: you will find no party handcuffs on them! Look at\r\n    my neck: you will not find there any collar with the\r\n    engraving,\r\n\r\n    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\r\n    .  MY DOG.—ANDREW JACKSON.   .\r\n    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\r\n\r\n    But you will find me standing up to my rack as the\r\n    people’s faithful representative, and the public’s most\r\n    obedient, very humble servant,\r\n\r\n    “DAVID CROCKETT.”\r\n\r\nWhat would not senators and representatives of to-day give for the same\r\nindependence? What health and manliness it would impart to public life,\r\nif every legislator were thus free of handcuffs and collars!\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1834, Crockett made his famous “starring tour” through\r\nthe East. From Philadelphia to Portland, and back to Washington, it\r\nwas a continuous ovation. Crockett and the populace were mutually\r\nastonished; he at his receptions, and they at the actions, appearance,\r\nand utterances of the man who had been represented to them by his\r\npolitical opponents as a buffoon and semi-savage. He was more than\r\nall impressed with the developments of wealth and enterprise in the\r\nNorth; he frankly confessed the prejudices he had formed against the\r\nYankees, and praised their thrift and principles. He spoke well and\r\nappropriately on each occasion, though—strange change in him!—with\r\nevident confusion at the lionizing. He wrote of the ovation he received\r\non landing in Philadelphia:\r\n\r\n    “It struck me strangely to hear a strange people\r\n    huzzaing for me; it took me so uncommon unexpected,\r\n    as I had no idea of attracting attention. The folks\r\n    came crowding around me, saying, ‘Give me the hand\r\n    of an honest man.’ I thought I had rather be in the\r\n    wilderness with my gun and dogs, than to be attracting\r\n    all that fuss.”\r\n\r\nIn a happy little speech here, from the hotel balcony, he said:\r\n\r\n    “I am almost induced to believe this flattery—perhaps\r\n    a burlesque. This is new to me, yet I see nothing but\r\n    friendship in your faces.”\r\n\r\nAt a grand banquet in New York City, Crockett having been toasted as\r\n“The undeviating supporter of the constitution and the laws,” made\r\nthis neat and characteristic hit, as he reports it:\r\n\r\n    “I made a short speech, and concluded with the story of\r\n    the red cow, which was, that as long as General Jackson\r\n    went straight, I followed him; but when he began to go\r\n    this way, and that way, and every way, I wouldn’t go\r\n    after him; like the boy whose master ordered him to\r\n    plough across the field to the red cow. Well, he began\r\n    to plough, and she began to walk; and he ploughed all\r\n    forenoon after her. So when the master came, he swore\r\n    at him for going so crooked. ‘Why, sir,’ said the boy,\r\n    ‘you told me to plough to the red cow, and I kept after\r\n    her, but she always kept moving.’”\r\n\r\nMost enthusiastic of all was his reception in Boston, where President\r\nJackson’s policy was most unpopular. It was even proposed to confer\r\non Crockett the degree of LL.D., an honor that had been awarded to\r\nJackson: but, unlike Jackson, Crockett had the wit to decline an honor\r\nwhich neither of the two deserved.\r\n\r\nThe more he saw and heard the more humble he became. When called\r\nup for an after-dinner speech in Boston he burst out in his honest\r\nway—“I never had but six months’ schooling in all my life, and I\r\nconfess I consider myself a _poor tyke_ to be here addressing the most\r\nintelligent people in the world.” If he had not culture, he had what\r\nwas far more rare in that age of truckling to one-man power—_manhood_.\r\nIt seemed as if unlettered David Crockett was the only man in public\r\nlife to stand up straight, and people acknowledged the power of true\r\ncharacter. The culture and wealth of the East bowed to unspoiled\r\nmanhood; it was a revelation fresh from Nature’s hand.\r\n\r\nA few extracts from one of his more sustained and dignified efforts\r\nwill illustrate the development Crockett had attained by simple\r\nobservation. After praising New England he said:\r\n\r\n    “I don’t mean that because I eat your bread and drink\r\n    your liquor, that I feel so. No; that don’t make me see\r\n    clearer than I did. It is your habits, and manners,\r\n    and customs; your industry; your proud, independent\r\n    spirits; your hanging on to the eternal principles of\r\n    right and wrong; your liberality in prosperity, and\r\n    your patience when you are ground down by legislation,\r\n    which, instead of crushing you, whets your invention to\r\n    strike a path without a blaze on a tree to guide you;\r\n    and above all, your never-dying, deathless grip to our\r\n    glorious Constitution. These are the things that make\r\n    me think you are a mighty good people.\r\n\r\n    “I voted for Andrew Jackson because I believed he\r\n    possessed certain principles, and not because his name\r\n    was Andrew Jackson, or the ‘Hero,’ or ‘Old Hickory.’\r\n    And when he left those principles which induced me to\r\n    support him, I considered myself justified in opposing\r\n    him. This thing of man-worship I am a stranger to; I\r\n    don’t like it; it taints every action of life.\r\n\r\n    “I know nothing, by experience, of party discipline. I\r\n    would rather be a raccoon-dog, and belong to a Negro in\r\n    the forest, than to belong to any party, further than\r\n    to do justice to all, and to promote the interests of\r\n    my country. The time will and must come, when honesty\r\n    will receive its reward, and when the people of this\r\n    nation will be brought to a sense of their duty, and\r\n    will pause and reflect how much it cost us to redeem\r\n    ourselves from the government of one man. It cost the\r\n    lives and fortunes of thousands of the best patriots\r\n    that ever lived. Yes, gentlemen, hundreds of them fell\r\n    in sight of your own city.\r\n\r\n    “Gentlemen, if it is for opposing those high-handed\r\n    measures that you compliment me, I say I have done so,\r\n    and will do so, now and forever. I will be no man’s\r\n    man, and no party’s man, other than to be the people’s\r\n    faithful representative: and I am delighted to see the\r\n    noble spirit of liberty retained so boldly here, where\r\n    the first spark was kindled; and I hope to see it shine\r\n    and spread over our whole country.”\r\n\r\nHe took his seat in Congress, a central object in the political\r\nfield. His position was anomalous. Party ties were closely drawn,\r\nand party rancor bitter as it can be only when nothing but plunder\r\nis at stake between parties. The Democrats could not claim Crockett\r\nso long as he antagonized their god, Jackson; and the alliance of\r\nthe Whigs he most distinctly repudiated. He was an independent, an\r\n“unattached statesman;” the prototype of an element which has now\r\nbecome formidable in our politics, but a character for whom there was\r\nno place in those times. He was, like all eccentrics, ahead or apart\r\nfrom his age, and was at first feared, then shunned, and then called\r\ncrazy by the great body of public men, whose standard of sanity was to\r\nsacrifice manhood to party, to betray the Republic for spoils.\r\n\r\nIt was during this Congress that he created a sensation by antagonizing\r\nbenevolence of representatives at government expense. A bill had\r\nbeen reported and was about to pass, appropriating a gratuity to a\r\nnaval officer’s widow. Crockett made an unanswerable argument on the\r\nunconstitutionality of this and other such appropriations, and closed\r\nby offering, with other friends of the widow, to give her a week of his\r\nsalary as congressman. Not a member dared to answer or to vote for the\r\nbill, and not one followed Crockett’s example of charity at his own\r\nexpense.\r\n\r\nBut the independent, honest eccentric had reached the end of his public\r\ncareer. In the next congressional election he was beaten by tricks such\r\nas would not be tolerated at this time. One of these devices was to\r\nannounce fictitiously a large number of public meetings in Crockett’s\r\nname on the same day. When he failed to appear, as announced, speakers\r\nof the Jackson party, who would always arrange to be present, denounced\r\nCrockett as afraid to face his constituents upon his “treacherous and\r\ncorrupt record in Congress.” The defeat was a surprise to him; more, it\r\nalmost broke his heart. He wrote, manfully, but pathetically, “I have\r\nsuffered myself to be politically sacrificed to save my country from\r\nruin and disgrace.” I may add, like the man in the play, “Crockett’s\r\noccupation’s gone.”\r\n\r\nShortly after he made a farewell address to his constituents, into\r\nwhich he compressed a good deal of plain speaking, or as he says,\r\n“I put the ingredients in the cup pretty strong, I tell you: and\r\nI concluded by telling them that I was done with politics for the\r\npresent, and that they might all go to hell and I would go to Texas.”\r\n\r\n“When I returned home,” he adds, “I felt sort of cast down at the\r\nchange that had taken place in my fortunes; sorrow, it is said, will\r\nmake even an oyster feel poetical. Such was my state of feeling that I\r\nbegan to fancy myself inspired; so I took my pen in hand, and as usual,\r\nI went ahead.” This is\r\n\r\n\r\nCROCKETT’S FAREWELL TO HOME.\r\n\r\n    “Farewell to the mountains whose mazes to me\r\n     Were more beautiful far than Eden could be;\r\n     No fruit was forbidden, but Nature had spread\r\n     Her bountiful board, and her children were fed.\r\n     The hills were our garners—our herds wildly grew\r\n     And Nature was shepherd and husbandman too.\r\n     I felt like a monarch, yet thought like a man,\r\n     As I thanked the Great Giver, and worshiped his plan.\r\n\r\n    “The home I forsake where my offspring arose;\r\n     The graves I forsake where my children repose.\r\n     The home I redeemed from the savage and wild;\r\n     The home I have loved as a father his child;\r\n     The corn that I planted, the fields that I cleared,\r\n     The flocks that I raised, and the cabin I reared;\r\n     The wife of my bosom—Farewell to ye all!\r\n     In the land of the stranger I rise or I fall.\r\n\r\n    “Farewell to my country! I fought for thee well,\r\n     When the savage rushed forth like the demons from hell.\r\n     In peace or in war I have stood by thy side—\r\n     My country, for thee I have lived, would have died!\r\n     But I am cast off, my career now is run,\r\n     And I wander abroad like the prodigal son—\r\n     Where the wild savage roves, and the broad prairies spread,\r\n     The fallen—despised—will again go ahead.”\r\n\r\nWe can not follow our hero—for he was a moral hero—in his adventures\r\nwhile going across the country to Texas. Only one incident have we\r\nroom for. On the way he rode apace with a circuit preacher, a man not\r\nless a hardy adventurer than himself. He narrates this:\r\n\r\n    “We talked about politics, religion, and nature,\r\n    farming, and bear-hunting, and the many blessings that\r\n    an all-bountiful Providence had bestowed upon our\r\n    happy country. He continued to talk on this subject,\r\n    traveling over the whole ground, as it were, until\r\n    his imagination glowed, and his soul became full to\r\n    overflowing; and he checked his horse, and I stopped\r\n    mine also, and a stream of eloquence burst forth from\r\n    his aged lips, such as I have seldom listened to:\r\n    it came from the overflowing fountain of a pure and\r\n    grateful heart. We were alone in the wilderness, but as\r\n    he proceeded, it seemed to me as if the tall trees bent\r\n    their tops to listen; that the mountain stream laughed\r\n    out joyfully as it bounded on like some living thing;\r\n    that the fading flowers of autumn smiled, and sent\r\n    forth their fresher fragrance, as if conscious that\r\n    they would revive in spring; and even the sterile rocks\r\n    seemed to be endued with some mysterious influence. We\r\n    were alone in the wilderness, but all things told me\r\n    that God was there. The thought renewed my strength and\r\n    courage. I had left my country, felt somewhat like an\r\n    outcast, believed that I had been neglected and lost\r\n    sight of. But I was now conscious that there was one\r\n    watchful eye over me; no matter whether I dwelt in\r\n    the populous cities, or threaded the pathless forests\r\n    alone; no matter whether I stood in the high places\r\n    among men, or made my solitary lair in the untrodden\r\n    wild, that eye was still upon me. My very soul leaped\r\n    joyfully at the thought. I never felt so grateful in\r\n    all my life. I never loved my God so sincerely in all\r\n    my life. I felt that I still had a friend.\r\n\r\n    “When the old man finished, I found that my eyes were\r\n    wet with tears. I approached and pressed his hand, and\r\n    thanked him, and says I, ‘Now let us take a drink.’ I\r\n    set him the example, and he followed it, and in a style\r\n    too that satisfied me, that if he had ever belonged\r\n    to the temperance society, he had either renounced\r\n    membership, or obtained a dispensation.”\r\n\r\nCrockett reached Texas just in time to take part with the American\r\nfilibusters in the famous defense of the fortress of the Alamo, against\r\nSanta Anna’s army. On the 6th of March, 1836, the citadel was carried\r\nby the Mexicans by assault, only six of the little garrison surviving,\r\nof whom Crockett was one. When captured he stood at bay in an angle of\r\nthe fort, his shattered rifle in one hand and a bloody bowie-knife in\r\nthe other; twenty Mexicans, dead or dying, were at his feet. His face\r\nwas covered with blood flowing from a deep gash across his forehead.\r\nSanta Anna ordered the prisoners to be put to the sword. Crockett,\r\nhearing the order, though entirely unarmed, sprang like a tiger at the\r\nthroat of the Mexican general, but a dozen swords interrupted him and\r\ncut off his life.\r\n\r\nThus in its prime was thrown away a life that in many respects was\r\none of the most extraordinary in our annals. If he had enjoyed early\r\nadvantages, he would have been one of the greatest of Americans.\r\nNay, it is possible that if he had not been so deeply wounded by\r\ningratitude, treachery and defeat, and had remained at home, he,\r\ninstead of General Harrison, would have been the one to lead the\r\npopular revolution, when came the reaction from the unlicensed _regime_\r\nof Jackson and Van Buren.\r\n\r\nDavid Crockett’s courage, independence, honesty, goodness of heart,\r\nmade him shine “like a good deed in a naughty world.” He ought not\r\nto be forgotten by his countrymen, for a noble illustration of the\r\ncapabilities that may be found among the common people, and of the\r\ncareer possible to even the lowliest-born American citizen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWHEN a man is called feeble, what is meant by the expression?\r\nFeebleness denotes a relative state; a relative state of the being to\r\nwhom it is applied. He whose strength exceeds his necessities, though\r\nan insect, a worm, is a strong being; he whose necessities exceed his\r\nstrength, though an elephant, a lion, a conqueror, a hero, though a\r\ngod, is a feeble being.—ROUSSEAU.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[H] Abbott.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nETIQUETTE.\r\n\r\n\r\nEtiquette is from the French word for ticket, and its present use in\r\nEnglish suggests the old custom of distributing tickets or cards on\r\nwhich the ceremonies to be observed at any formal proceedings are\r\nfully set forth—a kind of program for important social gatherings of\r\ndistinguished persons. Modern usage has given the word a much wider\r\nsignificance. It means the manners or deportment of cultured people;\r\ntheir bearing toward, or treatment of others.\r\n\r\nThe suggestions in a recent number of THE CHAUTAUQUAN, respecting\r\n“street etiquette,” or things proper to be observed in riding, driving\r\nand walking, will not now be repeated, though many of our younger\r\nreaders might profit by having, on so familiar a subject, “line upon\r\nline, precept upon precept.”\r\n\r\nThe etiquette proper for the home and every-day life, in town and\r\ncountry, is quite as important, and embraces more things than there is\r\nspace to notice.\r\n\r\n\r\nCALLS AND CARDS.\r\n\r\nHome, the dearest spot on earth, would be no fit abode for social\r\nbeings if closed against the entrance and friendly offices of those\r\nwithout. The courtesies and kindness of neighbors must be received and\r\nreciprocated to make the home comforts complete. By simple methods\r\nthe most important amicable relations in society are established and\r\nmaintained.\r\n\r\nCalls may be distinguished as ceremonious or friendly. The latter\r\namong intimate friends may, and ought to be quite informal, and for\r\nthem no rules need be prescribed. Common-sense may be safely trusted,\r\nas to their manner, frequency, and the time spent in making them. But\r\nwell-disposed, cultured people will usually have friendly relations\r\nwith a much larger number than can be received on terms of close\r\nintimacy. As a means of establishing and maintaining such relations,\r\nmere formal calls are made. In the country and in small towns residents\r\nare expected to call on new-comers without having any previous\r\nacquaintance with them, or even having met them before. Ordinarily the\r\nnew-comer, of whatever rank, should not call formally on a resident\r\nfirst, but wait till the other has taken the initiative. If after the\r\nfirst meeting, for any reason, the resident does not care to pursue the\r\nacquaintance, it will be discontinued by not leaving cards or calling\r\nagain. The newcomer in like manner if not wishing to extend or continue\r\nthe acquaintance, will politely return the first call, leaving cards\r\nonly if the neighbors are not at home.\r\n\r\nIn some sections of the country calling on newcomers is done rather\r\nindiscriminately and with little regard to the real, or supposed social\r\nstanding of the persons. This accords best with our American ideas of\r\nequality, and is consistent for those whose friendships are decided by\r\ncharacter and personal accomplishments, rather than by the accidents\r\nof birth or wealth. The good society for which all may rightly aspire\r\nclaims as among its brightest jewels some who financially rank with\r\nthe lowly—rich only in the nobler qualities of mind and heart. The\r\netiquette that, in any way, closes the door to exclude them is more\r\nnice than wise.\r\n\r\nThose in high esteem in their community and most worthy will naturally,\r\nif circumstances permit, take the responsibility of first calls on\r\nstrangers who come to reside among them. The call itself is a tender\r\nof friendship, and friendly offices, even though intimacy is not found\r\npracticable or desirable.\r\n\r\nCustom does not require the residents of large cities to formally call\r\non all new-comers in their neighborhood, which would be impracticable,\r\nonly those quite near and having apparently about the same social\r\nstatus are entitled to this courtesy. Some discrimination is not only\r\nallowable but necessary.\r\n\r\nA desirable acquaintance once formed, however initiated, is maintained\r\nby calls more or less frequent, as circumstances may decide, or by\r\nleaving cards when for either party that is more convenient.\r\n\r\nVisiting cards must be left in person, not sent by mail or by the\r\nhand of a servant, unless in exceptional cases. Distance, unfavorable\r\nweather or delicate health might be sufficient reasons for sending the\r\ncards, but, as a rule, ladies leave their cards themselves, this being\r\nfound more acceptable.\r\n\r\nA lady’s visiting card should be plain, printed in clear type, with no\r\nornamental or old English letters. The name printed on the middle of\r\nthe card. The place of residence on the left-hand corner.\r\n\r\nA married lady would never use her christian name on a card, but that\r\nof her husband after Mrs., before her surname.\r\n\r\nIn most places it is customary and considered in good taste for\r\nhusbands and wives to have their names printed on the same card: “Mr.\r\nand Mrs.,” but each would still need separate cards of their own.\r\n\r\nThe title “Honorable” is not used on cards. Other titles are, omitting\r\nthe “The” preceding the title.\r\n\r\nIt is not in accordance with etiquette in most places for young ladies\r\nto have visiting cards of their own. Their names are printed beneath\r\nthat of their mother, on her card, either “Miss” or “the Misses,” as\r\nthe case may be. If the mother is not living, the daughter’s name would\r\nbe printed beneath that of her father, or of her brother, in case of a\r\nbrother and sister residing alone.\r\n\r\nIf a young lady is taken into society by a relative or friend, her name\r\nwould properly be written in pencil under that of her friend.\r\n\r\nIf a lady making calls finds the mistress of the house “not at home”\r\nshe will leave her card and also one of her husband’s for each, the\r\nmistress and her husband; but if she have a card with her own and her\r\nhusband’s name on it, she leaves but one of his separate cards.\r\n\r\nIf a lady were merely leaving cards, and not intending to call she\r\nwould hand the three cards to the person answering at the door, saying,\r\n“For Mrs. ——,” without asking whether she is at home or not.\r\n\r\nIf a lady is sufficiently intimate to call, asks for and finds her\r\nfriend at home, she should, on leaving the house, leave two of her\r\nhusband’s cards in a conspicuous place on the table in the hall. She\r\nshould not drop them in the card-basket or hand them to the hostess,\r\nthough she might silently hand them to the servant in the hall. She\r\nwill on no account leave her own card, having seen the lady which\r\nremoves all occasion for leaving her card.\r\n\r\nIf the lady were accompanied by her husband and the lady of the house\r\nat home, the husband would leave one of his own cards for the master of\r\nthe house, but if he also is at home no cards are left. A lady leaves\r\nher card for a lady only, while a gentleman leaves his for both husband\r\nand wife.\r\n\r\nA gentleman when calling takes his hat in his hand into the room and\r\nholds it until he has met the mistress of the house; he may then either\r\nplace it on a chair or table near him, or hold it in his hand till he\r\ntakes his leave.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    DREAMS, books, are each a world: and books we know,\r\n    Are a substantial world, both pure and good;\r\n    Round these, with tendrils strong as flesh and blood,\r\n    Our pastime and our happiness will grow.\r\n    There find I personal themes, a plenteous store,\r\n    Matter wherein right voluble I am,\r\n    To which I listen with a ready ear;\r\n    Two shall be named, preëminently dear,—\r\n    The gentle lady married to the Moor;\r\n    And heavenly Una, with her milk-white lamb.\r\n\r\n    Blessings be with them, and eternal praise,\r\n    Who gave us nobler loves and nobler cares—\r\n    The poets, who on earth have made us heirs\r\n    Of truth and pure delight by heavenly lays!\r\n    Oh! might my name be numbered among theirs,\r\n    Then gladly would I end my mortal days.\r\n\r\n    —_Wordsworth’s “Personal Talk.”_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNAPOLEON’S MARSHALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNapoleon’s marshals were twenty-six in number, of whom seven only\r\nwere born in a rank which would have entitled them to become general\r\nofficers under the old Monarchy. These were Kellermann, Berthier,\r\nDavoust, Macdonald, Marmont, Grouchy, and Poniatowski, a Pole. Of\r\nthe others, Murat was the son of an innkeeper, Lefèbvre of a miller,\r\nAugereau of a mason, Bernadotte of a weaver, and Ney of a cooper.\r\nMasséna’s father, like Murat’s, kept a village wine-shop; Lannes was\r\nthe son of an ostler, and was himself apprenticed to a dyer; Victor,\r\nwhose real name was Perrin, was the son of an invalided private\r\nsoldier, who after leaving the service became a market-crier; while\r\nSoult’s mother kept a mercer’s shop, and Oudinot’s a small _cafè_ with\r\na circulating library. The marshals sprung from the _bourgeoisie_ or\r\nmiddle class were Serrurier, whose father was an officer, but never\r\nrose above the rank of captain; Bessières, whose father, though a poor\r\nclerk in a lawyer’s office, was the son of a doctor; Suchet, who was\r\nthe son of a silk-merchant; Moncey, the son of a barrister; Gouvion,\r\nwho assumed the name of Saint-Cyr, and whose father practiced as an\r\nattorney; and Brune, who started in life as a journalist. It is curious\r\nto trace through the lives of the different men the effect which\r\ntheir earliest associations had upon them. Some grew ashamed of their\r\nparentage; whilst others bragged overmuch of being self-made men. Only\r\none or two bore their honors with perfect modesty and tact.\r\n\r\nThe noblest character among Napoleon’s marshals was beyond doubt\r\nAdrien Moncey, Duc de Conégliano. He was born at Besançon in 1754,\r\nand enlisted at the age of fifteen, simply that he might not be a\r\ncharge to his parents. From his father, the barrister, he had picked\r\nup a smattering of education, while Nature had given him a talent\r\nfor drawing. He looked so small and young when he was brought before\r\nthe colonel of the Franche Comté regiment for enrollment, that the\r\nlatter, who was quite a young man—the Count de Survilliers—asked him,\r\nlaughing, whether he had been tipsy from “drinking too much milk”\r\nwhen he fell into the hands of the recruiting sergeant. The sergeant,\r\nby way of proving that young Moncey had been quite sober when he had\r\nput on the white cockade (which was like taking the king’s shilling\r\nin England), produced a cleverly executed caricature of himself which\r\nthe boy had drawn; upon which M. de Survilliers predicted that so\r\naccomplished a recruit would quickly win an epaulette. This promise\r\ncame to nothing, for in 1789, after twenty years’ service, Moncey was\r\nonly a lieutenant. It was a noble trait in him that in after years he\r\nnever spoke resentfully of his slow promotion. He used to say that he\r\nhad been thoroughly well-trained, and he alluded kindly to all his\r\nformer officers. After Napoleon’s overthrow, Moncey’s conduct was most\r\nchivalrous; he privately blamed Ney’s betrayal of the Bourbons, for it\r\nwas not in his nature to approve of double-dealing, but he refused to\r\nsit in judgment upon his former comrade. Marshal Victor was sent to\r\nshake his resolution, but Moncey repeated two or three times: “I do not\r\nthink I should have acted as Ney did, but I believe he acted according\r\nto his conscience and did well; ordinary rules do not apply to this\r\ncase.” He eventually became governor of the Invalides, and it fell to\r\nhim in 1840 to receive Napoleon’s body when it was brought from St.\r\nHelena. It was remarked at the time that if Napoleon himself could have\r\ndesignated the man who was to discharge this pious duty, he would have\r\nchosen none other than Moncey, or Oudinot, who by a happy coincidence\r\nbecame governor of the Invalides in 1842 after Moncey’s death.\r\n\r\nNicolas Oudinot, Duc de Reggio, was surnamed the Modern Bayard. He was\r\nborn in 1767, and like Moncey enlisted in his sixteenth year. He was\r\nwounded thirty-two times in action, but was so little of a braggart\r\nthat in going among the old pensioners of the Invalides he was never\r\nheard to allude to his own scars. At Friedland a bullet went through\r\nboth his cheeks, breaking two molars. “These Russians do not know how\r\nto draw teeth,” was his only remark, as his wound was being dressed.\r\n\r\nAfter Friedland he received with the title of count a grant of £40,000,\r\nand he began to distribute money at such a rate among his poor\r\nrelations, that the emperor remonstrated with him. “You keep the lead\r\nfor yourself, and you give the gold away,” said His Majesty in allusion\r\nto two bullets which remained in the marshal’s body.\r\n\r\nMacdonald comes next among the marshals for nobility of character. He\r\nwas of Irish extraction, born at Sancerre in 1765, and served under\r\nLouis XVI. in Dillon’s Irish Regiment. Macdonald won his colonelcy at\r\nJemmapes. In 1804, however, all his prospects were suddenly marred\r\nthrough his generous espousal of Moreau’s cause. Moreau had been\r\nbanished on an ill-proven charge of conspiracy; and Macdonald thought,\r\nlike most honest men, that he had been very badly treated.\r\n\r\nBut by saying aloud what most honest men were afraid even to whisper,\r\nMacdonald incurred the Corsican’s vindictive hatred, and during\r\nfive years he was kept in disgrace, being deprived of his command,\r\nand debarred from active service. He thus missed the campaigns\r\nof Austerlitz and Jéna, and this was a bitter chagrin to him. He\r\nretired to a small country-house near Brunoy, and one of his favorite\r\noccupations was gardening. He was much interested in the projects\r\nfor manufacturing sugar out of beetroot, which were to render France\r\nindependent of West India sugar—a matter of great consequence after\r\nthe destruction of France’s naval power at Trafalgar: and he had an\r\nintelligent gardener who helped him in his not very successful efforts\r\nto raise fine beetroots. This man turned out to be a police-spy.\r\nNapoleon in his jealousy of Moreau and hatred of all who sympathized\r\nwith the latter, had thought it good to have Macdonald watched, and\r\nhe appears to have suspected at one time that the hero of Otricoli\r\ncontemplated taking service in the English army. There were other\r\nmarshals besides Macdonald who had reasons to complain of Napoleon;\r\nVictor’s hatred of him was very lively, and arose out of a practical\r\njoke. Victor was the vainest of men; he had entered Louis XVI.’s\r\nservice at fifteen as a drummer, but when he became an officer under\r\nthe Republic he was weak enough to be ashamed of his humble origin\r\nand assumed his Christian name of Victor as a surname instead of his\r\npatronymic of Perrin. He might have pleaded, to be sure, that Victor\r\nwas a name of happy augury to a soldier, but he does not appear to\r\nhave behaved well toward his Perrin connections. He was a little man\r\nwith a waist like a pumpkin, and a round, rosy, jolly face, which had\r\ncaused him to be nicknamed _Beau Soleil_. A temperate fondness for red\r\nwine added occasionally to the luster of his complexion. He was not a\r\ngeneral of the first order, but brave and faithful in carrying out his\r\nmaster’s plans; he had an honorable share in the victory of Friedland,\r\nand after this battle was promoted to the marshalate and to a dukedom.\r\nNow Victor would have liked to be made Duke of Marengo; but Napoleon’s\r\nsister Pauline suggested that his services in the two Italian wars\r\ncould be commemorated as well by the title of Belluno—pronounced in\r\nFrench, Bellune. It was not until after Napoleon had innocently acceded\r\nto this suggestion that he learned his facetious sister had in choosing\r\nthe title of Bellune (Belle Lune) played upon the sobriquet of Beau\r\nSoleil. He was at first highly displeased at this, but Victor himself\r\ntook the joke so very badly that the emperor ended by joining in the\r\nlaughter, and said that if the marshal did not like the title that had\r\nbeen given him, he should have no other. Wounds in vanity seldom heal,\r\nand Victor, as soon as he could safely exhibit his resentment, showed\r\nhimself one of Napoleon’s bitterest enemies. During the Hundred Days he\r\naccompanied Louis XVIII. to Ghent, and he figured in full uniform at\r\nthe _Te Deum_ celebrated in the Cathedral of Saint Bavon in honor of\r\nWaterloo.\r\n\r\nAugereau, Duc de Castiglione, was of all the marshals the one in whom\r\nthere is least to admire; yet he was for a time the most popular among\r\nthem, having been born in Paris and possessing the devil-may-care\r\nimpudence of Parisians. He was the son of a mason and of a street\r\nfruit-vendor, and he began life as apprentice to his father’s trade.\r\nSoon after he enlisted, and proved a capital soldier; but his character\r\nwas only good in the military sense. He was thirty-two when the\r\nRevolution broke out, and was then wearing a sergeant’s stripes; in\r\nthe following year he got a commission; in 1793 he was a colonel; in\r\n1795 a general. His rapid promotion was not won by valor only, but by\r\nsending to the war office bombastic despatches in which he magnified\r\nevery achievement of his twenty-fold, and related it with a rigmarole\r\nof patriotic sentiments and compliments to the convention.\r\n\r\nThere was one great point of resemblance between Augereau and Masséna:\r\nthey were both inveterate looters. In 1798, when Masséna was sent\r\nto Rome to establish a republic, his own soldiers were disgusted by\r\nthe shameless way in which he plundered palaces and churches, and he\r\nactually had to resign his command owing to their murmurs. Augereau was\r\na more wily spoiler, for he gave his men a good share of what he took,\r\nand kept another share for Parisian museums, but he always reserved\r\nenough for himself to make his soldiering a very profitable business.\r\n\r\nIt was politic of Napoleon to make of Augereau a marshal-duke, for\r\napart from the man’s intrepidity, which was unquestionable (though he\r\nwas a poor general), the honors conferred upon him were a compliment\r\nto the whole class of Parisian _ouvriers_. Augereau’s mother, the\r\ncosterwoman, lived to see him in all his glory, and he was good to\r\nher, for once, at a state pageant, when he was wearing the plumed\r\nhat of a senator, and the purple velvet mantle with its _semis_ of\r\ngolden bees, he gave her his arm in public. This incident delighted\r\nall the market-women of Paris, and helped to make Napoleon’s court\r\npopular; but in general respects Augereau proved an unprofitable,\r\nungrateful servant. He was one of the first marshals to grumble against\r\nhis master’s repeated campaigns, and he deserted him in 1814 under\r\ncircumstances which looked suspicious. Napoleon accused him of letting\r\nhimself be purposely beaten by the Allies. After the escape from Elba,\r\nAugereau first pronounced himself vehemently against the “usurper;”\r\nthen proffered him his services, which were contemptuously spurned. The\r\nDuc de Castiglione’s career ended then, for he retired to his estate at\r\nHoussaye, and died a year afterward, little regretted by anybody.\r\n\r\nMasséna, who had been born the year after Augereau, died the year after\r\nhim, in 1817. He too had enlisted very young, but finding he could get\r\nno promotion, had asked his friends to buy his discharge, and during\r\nthe five years that preceded the Revolution, he served as potman in his\r\nfather’s tavern at Leven. Re-enlisting in 1789, he became a general in\r\nless than four years. After Rivoli, Bonaparte dubbed him “The darling\r\nof victory;” but it was a curious feature in Masséna that his talents\r\nonly came out on the battle-field. Usually he was a dull dog, with no\r\nfaculty for expressing his ideas, and he wore a morose look. Napoleon\r\nsaid that “the noise of cannon cleared his mind,” endowing him with\r\npenetration and gaiety at the same time. The din of war had just the\r\ncontrary effect upon Brune, who, but for his tragic death, would have\r\nremained the most obscure of the marshals, though he is conspicuous\r\nfrom being almost the only one of the twenty-six who had no title of\r\nnobility. Brune was a notable example of what strong will-power can\r\ndo to conquer innate nervousness. He was the son of a barrister, and\r\nhaving imbibed the hottest revolutionary principles, vapored them\r\noff by turning journalist. He went to Paris, and was introduced to\r\nDanton, for whom he conceived an enthusiastic admiration. He became\r\nthe demagogue’s disciple, letter-writer, and boon companion, and it is\r\npretty certain that he would eventually have kept him company on the\r\nguillotine, had it not been for a lucky sneer from a woman’s lips which\r\ndrove him into the army. Brune had written a pamphlet on military\r\noperations, and it was being talked of at Danton’s table, when Mdlle.\r\nGerfault, an actress of the Palais Royal, better known as “Eglé,” said\r\nmockingly, “You will be a general when we fight with pens.” Stung to\r\nthe quick, Brune applied for a commission, was sent into the army with\r\nthe rank of major, and in about a year, through Danton’s patronage,\r\nbecame a brigade-general; meanwhile poor Eglé, having wagged her pert\r\ntongue at Robespierre, lost her head in consequence.\r\n\r\nThe marshal on whom ducal honors seemed to sit most queerly was\r\nFrançois Lefèbvre, Duc de Dantzig. He was born in 1755, the son of a\r\nmiller, and was a sergeant in the French guards at the time of the\r\nRevolution. He had then just married a _vivandière_. The anecdotes of\r\nMadame Lefèbvre’s incongruous sayings at the consular and imperial\r\ncourts are so many as to remind one of the proverb, “We yield only to\r\nriches.” Everything that could be imagined in the way of a _lapsus\r\nlinguæ_ or a bull was attributed to this good-natured Mrs. Malaprop,\r\nwhose oddities amused Josephine, but not always Napoleon.\r\n\r\nOnce Lefèbvre fell ill of ague, and his servant, an old soldier, caught\r\nthe malady at the same time. The servant was quickly cured; but the\r\nfever clung to the marshal until it occurred to his energetic duchess\r\nthat the doctor had blundered by giving to a marshal the same doses as\r\nto a private soldier. She rapidly counted on her fingers the different\r\nrungs of the military ladder. “Here, drink, this suits your rank,” she\r\nsaid, putting a full tumbler to her husband’s lips, and the duke having\r\nswallowed a dozen doses at one gulp, was soon on his legs again. “You\r\nhave much to learn, my friend,” was the lady’s subsequent remark to the\r\nastonished doctor.\r\n\r\nNapoleon was a great stickler for appearances, and for this reason\r\nloathed the dirtiness and slovenliness of Davoust. Madame Junot, in\r\nher amusing “Memoirs,” relates that the Duc d’Auerstadt, having some\r\nfacial resemblance to Napoleon, was fond of copying him in dress and\r\nmanners; but she adds that Napoleon himself was very neat. A marshal\r\nhad no excuse for being untidy. Davoust had been at Brienne with\r\nBonaparte, and had thus a longer experience of his master’s character\r\nthan any of the other marshals. Had he been wise he would have turned\r\nit to account, not only by cultivating the graces, but by giving the\r\nemperor that ungrudging, demonstrative loyalty which Napoleon valued\r\nabove all things, and rewarded by constant favor. But Davoust was a\r\ncaballer, a grievance-monger, and a _grognard_; and it must have been\r\nrather diverting to see him aping the manners of a master at whom he\r\nwas always carping in holes and corners. On the other hand, it must\r\nbe said that Davoust proved faithful in the hour of misfortune, and\r\ndid not rally to the Bourbons till 1818; that is, when all chances of\r\nan imperial restoration were gone; moreover, every time he held an\r\nimportant command he did his duty with courage, talent, and fidelity.\r\nHis affected brusqueness of speech was an unfortunate mannerism, for it\r\nmade him many enemies, and sometimes exposed him to odd reprisals. The\r\nroughness of tongue which was affected in Davoust was natural in Soult.\r\nThis marshal had an excellent heart, but he could not, for the life\r\nof him, refrain from snarling at anybody whom he heard praised. The\r\nproverb about bite and bark might have been invented for him, as the\r\nmen at whom he grumbled most were often those whom he most favored.\r\n\r\nSoult was born in the same year as Napoleon, 1769, and out-lived\r\nall his brother marshals, dying in 1852, when the second empire was\r\nalready an impending fact. He had been a private soldier under Louis\r\nXVI., he passed through every grade in the service, he became prime\r\nminister, and when he voluntarily resigned office in 1847, owing to\r\nthe infirmities of age, Louis Philippe created him marshal-general—a\r\ntitle which had only been borne by three marshals before him, Turenne,\r\nVillars, and Maurice de Saxe. But these honors never quite consoled\r\nSoult for having failed to become king of Portugal. He could not\r\nstomach the luck of his comrade Bernadotte, the son of a weaver, who\r\nwas wearing the crown of Sweden.\r\n\r\nBernadotte, whom Soult envied, has some affinities with M. Grévy.\r\nThis president of the republic first won renown by a parliamentary\r\nmotion to the effect that a republic did not want a president; so\r\nBernadotte came to be a king, after a long and steadfast profession\r\nof republican principles. Born in 1764, he enlisted at eighteen, and\r\nwas sergeant-major in 1789. He was very nearly court-martialed at that\r\ntime for haranguing a crowd in revolutionary terms. Five years later\r\nhe was a general, and in 1798 ambassador at Vienna. He was an able,\r\nthoughtful, hardy, handsome man, who, having received no education as a\r\nboy, made up for it by diligent study in after years; and no man ever\r\nso well corrected, in small or great things, the imperfections of early\r\ntraining. Tallyrand said of him, “He is a man who learns and _unlearns_\r\nevery day.” One thing he learned was to read the character of Napoleon\r\nand not to be afraid of him, for the act which led to his becoming king\r\nof Sweden was one of rare audacity. Commanding an army sent against\r\nthe Swedes in 1808, he suspended operations on learning the overthrow\r\nby revolution of Gustavus IV., against whom war had been declared.\r\nThe Swedes were profoundly grateful for this, and Napoleon dared not\r\nsay much, because he was supposed to have no quarrel with the Swedes\r\nas a people; but Bernadotte was marked down in his bad books from\r\nthat day, and he was in complete disgrace when in 1810 Charles XIII.\r\nadopted him as crown prince with the approval of the Swedish people.\r\nBernadotte made an excellent king, but remembering his austere advocacy\r\nof republicanism, it is impossible not to smile and ask whether there\r\nis not some truth in Madame de Girardin’s definition of equality as _le\r\nprivilége pour tous_.\r\n\r\nNapoleon always valued Kellerman as having been a general in the old\r\nroyal army. Born in 1735, he was a maréchal de camp (brigadier) when\r\nthe war broke out. The emperor would have been glad to have had more\r\nof such men at his court; but it was creditable to the king’s general\r\nofficers that very few of them forgot their duties as soldiers during\r\nthe troublous period when so many temptations to commit treason beset\r\nmen holding high command. Grouchy, who in 1789 was a lieutenant in\r\nthe king’s body-guard, hardly cuts a fine figure as a revolutionist\r\naccepting a generalship in 1793 from the convention which had beheaded\r\nhis king. He was an uncanny person altogether; the convention having\r\nvoted that all noblemen should be debarred from commissions, he\r\nenlisted as a private soldier, and this was imputed to him as an act\r\nof patriotism; but he had friends in high quarters who promised that\r\nhe should quickly regain his rank if he formally renounced his titles;\r\nand this he did, getting his generalship restored in consequence. In\r\nafter years he resumed his marquisate, and denied that he had ever\r\nabjured it. Napoleon created him marshal during the Hundred Days for\r\nhaving taken the Duc d’Angoulême prisoner; but the Bourbons declined\r\nto recognize his title to the _bâton_, and he had to wait till Louis\r\nPhilippe’s reign before it was confirmed to him. Grouchy was never\r\na popular marshal, though he fought well in 1814 in the campaign of\r\nFrance. His inaction on the day of Waterloo has been satisfactorily\r\nexplained, but somehow all his acts have required explanation; he was\r\none of those men whose records are never intelligible without footnotes.\r\n\r\nBut how many of the marshals remained faithful to their master when his\r\nsun had set? At St. Helena Napoleon alluded most often to Lannes and\r\nBessières, who both died whilst he was in the heyday of his power, the\r\nfirst at Essling, the second at Lützen. As to these two Napoleon could\r\ncherish illusions, and he loved to think that Lannes especially—his\r\nbrave, hot-headed, hot-hearted “Jean-Jean”—would have clung to him like\r\na brother in misfortune. Perhaps it was as well that Lannes was spared\r\nan ordeal to which Murat, hot-headed and hot-hearted too, succumbed. It\r\nis at all events a bitter subject for reflection that the great emperor\r\nfound among his marshals and dukes no such friend as he had among the\r\nhundreds of humbler officers, captains, and lieutenants, who threw up\r\ntheir commissions sooner than serve the Bourbons.—_Temple Bar._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nC.

There is a university\r\ncharter in the hands of the Chautauqua management—a university to be.\r\nIn this university there will be non-resident courses of study, with a\r\nrigid annual examination, to be followed by degrees and diplomas. There\r\nmay sometime in the future be a permanent Chautauqua University at\r\nChautauqua. Further than this I can say nothing now. It is to be hoped\r\nthe Chautauqua University will never confer honorary degrees.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCorrespond with some one on the studies of the C. L. S. C.

Bridge, 718 State St., New\r\nHaven, Conn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW ENGLAND BRANCH OF THE CLASS OF ’86.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile at Lake View a New England Branch of the Class of ’86 was\r\norganized, with the following officers: President, Rev. B. T. Snow,\r\nBiddeford, Me.; vice-presidents, Rev. W. H. Clark, South Norridgewock,\r\nMe., Edwin F. Reeves, Laconia, N. H., Rev. J. H. Babbitt, Swanton, Vt.,\r\nCharles Wainwright, Lawrence, Mass., Miss Lousia E. French, Newport, R.\r\nI., Rev. A. Gardner, Buckingham, Ct.; secretary and treasurer, Mary R.\r\nHinckley, Bedford, Mass. The above officers were authorized to act also\r\nas an executive board.\r\n\r\nThe badge of Class of ’86 can be obtained of the President. It has\r\nbeen decided to use in private correspondence a certain style of\r\nletter paper marked with “C. L. S. C. ’86” in a neat monogram. Further\r\nparticulars in regard to this paper will soon be given.\r\n\r\nJust before leaving Chautauqua the Class of ’86 adopted a motto: “We\r\nstudy for light, to bless with light.” The New England branch adopts\r\nthis motto, in addition to the one chosen at Lake View: “Let us keep\r\nour Heavenly Father in the midst.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nC. L. S. C. TESTIMONY.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Canada._—It was a bitter disappointment to me that I was compelled\r\nto leave school at fourteen and earn my own living, giving up the\r\nidea of a college course. The C. L. S. C. has been to me therefore an\r\nunspeakable boon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Vermont._—I have received large benefit as well as pleasure during the\r\nyear that I have been a member of the C. L. S. C. The course of reading\r\nhas taken me into broader fields, opened new avenues of thought and\r\nreflection, widened my field of vision, and altogether made me a better\r\nman.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Vermont._—According to Isaiah xxx:7, I have been trying to show my\r\nstrength by “sitting still” four years. I often ask myself, what\r\nshould I have done had I not had this interesting course—the C. L. S.\r\nC. During these four years of deprivation how many sorrows have been\r\nalmost forgotten while reading the many interesting thoughts that are\r\npresented in our reading. I thank God many times for this glorious\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Connecticut._—I have been very much interested in the studies of\r\nthe C. L. S. C. during the first year. It is an honor as well as a\r\nprivilege to be a member.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Rhode Island._—Many times home duties have occupied time and thought\r\nso fully as to discourage me. But realizing that I am to live “heartily\r\nas to the Lord,” and viewing the course as his special blessing, I have\r\ngathered inspiration and journeyed on patiently.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_New York._—I have enjoyed my four years’ course very much, and hope\r\nthat it has been profitable to me. Though having reached the age of\r\nsixty years my love for improvement has not been gratified, and I\r\npurpose to continue the course that is marked out.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_New York._—I am surprised at the pleasure and advantage the C. L. S.\r\nC. has been to me. I have read no more than usual, but have read more\r\nsystematically, and received greater benefit. There is inspiration in\r\nbeing “one of many.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_New York._—I have taken great pleasure in the reading. Am very\r\nenthusiastic over the course, and will try my best to graduate. I do it\r\na great deal for my children, hoping that I may be a better mother, and\r\ntrain their minds so that they will make better men and women than they\r\nwould have been had I not become a member of the C. L. S. C. Am all\r\nalone in my reading, except what my boy of fourteen does with me; even\r\nmy little girl just turned seven studies geology with me, and is much\r\ninterested in finding specimens.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Pennsylvania._—I have only been a member of the C. L. S. C. for about\r\nfour months and in that time I have done most of my reading at night,\r\nreading usually from eight o’clock until eleven. As I have to work hard\r\nall day, I have little time for reading except at night, I find the\r\ncourse very interesting, and I am deriving a great amount of good from\r\nit.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Pennsylvania._—For almost two years my work has required my presence\r\ntwelve hours every week day, and part of the time sixteen and eighteen\r\nhours. I gave up last summer, thinking I could not finish the course,\r\nbut after being present at Chautauqua I had a greater desire than ever\r\nto continue. I have at leisure moments read up for the two years, and\r\nmust ever feel grateful to Chautauqua influence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Ohio._—I am a farmer’s wife, but with all the care of the work that\r\nposition in life brings (and a good share of the work too), I still\r\nfind time to read the regular four years’ course of the C. L. S. C.,\r\nand desire to do as thorough work as I am capable of doing. Am reading\r\nnot merely for pleasure, far less to criticise, but for _instruction_,\r\nand have been greatly helped by this first year’s study.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Ohio._—In many ways I think the C. L. S. C. has been of benefit to\r\nthe little ones. This last winter my eldest daughter said: “Why can’t\r\nwe have a society of our own?” “We,” meant the family. I seconded it\r\ngladly, and my husband also, and we resolved ourselves into the “Clio\r\nClique” and took as our work “Art and Artists,” as mapped out in the\r\n_St. Nicholas_. Each member pledged themselves to take the work given\r\nthem by the president (who was our only officer), and also to commit\r\nnot less than eight lines of some poem to memory. We had no outside\r\nmembers, and we did our work right well, I think.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Illinois._—The C. L. S. C. has done much for me. Life has been\r\nbrighter, sweeter and better than it might otherwise have been.\r\nFriendships have been formed which I am sure will survive life, and add\r\nanother link in the golden chain that binds us to another world.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Michigan._—To the C. L. S. C. I owe everything.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Michigan._—Were it not that I still may keep a place in the Circle,\r\nI should be sorry the four years were over. They have been pleasant\r\nones, so far as the Circle was concerned, and have passed swiftly. It\r\nseemed a great undertaking to me four years ago, when I commenced the\r\ncourse. For one thing, I did not see my way clear to get the books, but\r\nI resolved to try, and it has seemed all along that it was God’s way of\r\nhelping me to the knowledge I had so much desired.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Wisconsin._—A lady writes: The regular methods of the C. L. S. C. have\r\nsuggested to me the plan of having a little home monthly, contributed\r\nto only by members of the family, written, and read aloud on a\r\nspecified evening each month. The children write prose and poetry that\r\nare a surprise, but only the effect of a regular course of reading and\r\nconversations by one member of the family. While reading astronomy,\r\none of the little girls, aged ten years, took two looking-glasses and\r\nillustrated, in play, the motions of a planet. She held them by the\r\nwindow in the sun, so as to throw the reflection on the ceiling. One\r\nshe had stationary, for the sun, the other she caused to go around\r\nit, causing the motion to hasten at perihelion, and to become slow at\r\naphelion, describing the motions correctly. Then she imagined a comet,\r\ncausing it to go out of sight, then return, and upon its approach to\r\nthe sun rushing it past with lightning speed. I called the attention\r\nof their father to their play with much delight, for I had no idea\r\nthey understood the motions so well, simply from conversations on the\r\nsubject in the family circle. They all joined in the conversation at\r\nplay, and seemed to comprehend it all.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Iowa._—The studies have benefited me much more than I can express\r\nin words. May heaven’s choicest blessings rest upon the officers and\r\neveryone connected with the C. L. S. C.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Kansas._—I am one of the busy housekeepers, but always find time\r\nto read. My reading has uplifted my soul, and led me to a fuller\r\nappreciation of the power and love of God, and I feel thankful that I\r\nam numbered with the army of Chautauquans.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_California._—When I read the C. L. S. C. testimony in THE CHAUTAUQUAN,\r\nI always think Chautauqua has been _all that_ and _more_ to me, for\r\nit has led me from cold, dark skepticism to my Bible and my Father in\r\nheaven, and it is gradually leading some of my friends into the light.\r\nI prize my C. L. S. C. books more highly that they are worn and soiled\r\nby many readers, and I believe I can do no better missionary work than\r\nby enlarging the Circle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nC. L. S. C. REUNION.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of June 27, at Pendleton, Indiana, a delightful C. L.\r\nS. C. reunion was held. The circle of Pendleton invited the circle from\r\nthe neighboring village of Greenfield to join with them in their last\r\nmeeting for the year. A goodly number of visitors were present. After\r\nan entertaining program of speeches, songs, toasts, etc., had been\r\ncarried out, the following class histories were read:\r\n\r\n\r\nPENDLETON LOCAL CIRCLE.\r\n\r\n    On the evening of the 28th of December, 1881, a little\r\n    company of eight ladies and five gentlemen assembled\r\n    at the home of Dr. Huston, Pendleton, Indiana, for the\r\n    purpose of more fully discussing the Chautauqua Idea,\r\n    and if possible to organize a branch of the great\r\n    Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circle. Three months\r\n    behind in the year’s studies, the outlook was not as\r\n    encouraging as could have been wished, but finding one\r\n    of the class mottoes to be “Never be discouraged,”\r\n    it was unanimously agreed that we organize. Teachers\r\n    were also chosen for the principal studies, and it\r\n    was thought best that they should present the lessons\r\n    to the class in the form of questions. This method\r\n    was generally observed throughout the year, with the\r\n    exception of some lectures on geology. At each session\r\n    two of the members were appointed to write papers\r\n    for the following week, on some subject pertaining\r\n    to the lessons. Longfellow’s birthday was the only\r\n    memorial observed. Besides the usual exercises of the\r\n    evening a short sketch of the life of the poet was\r\n    read, followed by the reading of two of his poems. Our\r\n    weekly meetings were well kept up, and much interest\r\n    manifested in the studies until the first of May, when\r\n    owing to summer heat, and many calls on the time of the\r\n    different members, it was thought best to meet once a\r\n    month, each member being given a portion of the studies\r\n    to be brought forward at the next session. This plan\r\n    was found to be a good one for the summer months, and\r\n    was continued until the beginning of the new year’s\r\n    studies, when the weekly meetings were again resumed,\r\n    and the meetings were spent in much the same manner as\r\n    the first year with the exception of the evening of the\r\n    thirtieth of November, when a complete change was made\r\n    in the program, by having a C. L. S. C. thanksgiving\r\n    supper and a general good time at the residence of Mr.\r\n    and Mrs. Whitney. Since that time our circle has lost\r\n    several of its members either from sickness or change\r\n    of residence, but we hope ere the beginning of another\r\n    year to be fully reinforced and ready to continue the\r\n    good work.\r\n\r\n\r\n    GREENFIELD LOCAL CIRCLE.\r\n\r\n    Although we have met to-day as strangers, we find that\r\n    the unity of thought and purpose that has characterized\r\n    our work the past year has made us friends. The history\r\n    of our circle is necessarily brief because of the short\r\n    time it has been in existence. When we first organized\r\n    in the fall of ’82, a part of us supposed we were\r\n    entering the society temporarily and did not expect to\r\n    matriculate and become regular members of the mystic\r\n    tie, but we only met a few times till we perceived the\r\n    advantages we were deriving from the association, one\r\n    with another, and saw the necessity of a permanent\r\n    organization. Now there are ten of us enrolled as\r\n    students of the “University of the C. L. S. C.” We\r\n    pursued the course with a great deal of enthusiasm and\r\n    delight, and if it were possible, each study seemed\r\n    more interesting than the preceding. With a great deal\r\n    of reluctance we laid aside geology and Greek history\r\n    for astronomy and English history, but we soon saw we\r\n    were susceptible of inspiration from the latter as well\r\n    as the former. Our circle, except two, is composed of\r\n    married ladies. As housewives we feel that the course\r\n    has been very beneficial—it has relieved the monotony\r\n    and tedium of housekeeping because it has given us\r\n    something ennobling to think of—it has also given us\r\n    a taste for something else than the last novel and\r\n    the latest piece of gossip in the daily papers. We\r\n    feel as though we could adopt the sentiment of Plato.\r\n    A friend who observed that he seemed as desirous to\r\n    learn himself as to teach others, asked him how long he\r\n    expected to remain a student? Plato replied, “As long\r\n    as I am not ashamed to grow wiser and better.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTEMPERANCE and labor are the two best physicians of man; labor\r\nsharpens the appetite, and temperance prevents him from indulging to\r\nexcess.—_Rousseau._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCAL CIRCLES.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Province of Quebec (Bedford).=—The Harmony Circle was organized here\r\nlast September. We are seven in number, all having so many cares that\r\nthe Chautauqua work has to be done by improving the spare moments, and\r\noften by giving up some pleasure or recreation; but the sacrifice is\r\nmade willingly. Each member prepares seven questions; the number to be\r\nchosen from each subject in hand is determined at the previous meeting.\r\nEach in turn puts a question to his or her nearest neighbor, then the\r\nsecond time round to the nearest but one, and so on; thus each member\r\nputs a question to every other member. This, with discussions and\r\nconversations which arise from the lesson, occupies more than two hours\r\nin a very enjoyable manner. We have derived profit from the work, both\r\nin increase of knowledge and improvement of literary taste. Our circle\r\nhas also been the source of much kindly feeling and mutual interest,\r\nand a strong bond of friendship amongst us.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=Maine (Brownfield).=—Our circle was organized early in October, 1882,\r\nwith ten regular members, five gentlemen and five ladies. We arranged\r\nto meet once in two weeks, and enjoyed our evenings together so much\r\nthat it was extremely difficult to keep the length of our sessions\r\nwithin reasonable bounds. We congratulated ourselves constantly on the\r\npleasure afforded us by our studies, and on the obvious improvement,\r\nfrom month to month, in the work of individual members. It was\r\ndecided, for the present year at least, to change the whole board of\r\nofficers once in three months, that the educating influences of the\r\nresponsibilities connected with the various offices might be shared, in\r\nturn, by all who were willing to accept them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=Maine (Fairfield).=—A local circle was organized here in October,\r\n1882, and now numbers fifteen members, nearly all of whom have\r\ncompleted the required readings to date. Teachers are assigned to each\r\nof the subjects as they are taken up, and recitations are conducted\r\nwith excellent system and thoroughness. In addition to this we have\r\nnumerous essays and readings, and the enthusiasm is such that,\r\nnotwithstanding our regular meetings occur fortnightly, we have many\r\nspecial meetings. It is the custom at all of our meetings to criticize\r\nfreely, and this leads to an exactness of pronunciation when reading,\r\nnot otherwise to be attained.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=Maine (Brownfield).=—Our circle meets once in two weeks, takes\r\nup questions in THE CHAUTAUQUAN, and then devotes a short time to\r\nquestions of our own asking, using a question-box. We think this an\r\nexcellent plan. After this we generally have short essays on the\r\nsubjects we are reading, often closing with general conversation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=Massachusetts (Wareham).=—The Pallas Circle closed for the season with\r\na lawn party, June 18.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGRAM.\r\n\r\n    Singing—“A Song of To-day.”\r\n\r\n    Roll-Call—Responses of quotations from any of the\r\n    reading of the past year.\r\n\r\n    Secretary’s report.\r\n\r\n    Selected questions in Astronomy, answered by members of\r\n    the circle.\r\n\r\n    Reading—“The Vision of Mirza.”\r\n\r\n    Essay—“The Mythological Story of Ursa Major and Ursa\r\n    Minor.”\r\n\r\n    Reading—Selections from “Evangeline.”\r\n\r\n    Reading—“The Fan-drill.”—(Addison.)\r\n\r\n    Singing—Chautauqua Carols.\r\n\r\n    Supper—Toasts and Responses, including two original\r\n    poems.\r\n\r\nThough small in numbers the circle is very enthusiastic in its work.\r\nNew members for the coming year were enrolled from the invited guests\r\nof the occasion, and the readings will be commenced in October with\r\nfresh vigor.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=Massachusetts (Haverhill).=—A local circle was organized in Haverhill,\r\nMarch 14, 1883, with the following officers: R. D. Trask, president;\r\nGeorge H. Foster, vice president; Delia Drew, secretary. Whole\r\nmembership numbers seventeen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=Massachusetts (Natick).=—The Natick local circle was organized\r\nSeptember 20, 1879. Eight of the original members, keeping in view the\r\nmotto, “never be discouraged,” have completed the four years’ course.\r\nAt the commencement of the present year our local circle numbered\r\ntwenty-five. We enjoy our reading greatly, and consider the Natick C.\r\nL. S. C. a success.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=Connecticut (West Haven).=—Our circle was organized November 14,\r\n1881, and numbers seventeen members. We meet once a week. Our circle\r\nis divided into committees of three and four to arrange programs for\r\nthe month’s entertainments. They include reviews, essays on different\r\nsubjects connected with the course, readings and recitations.\r\n“Shakspere’s Day” was observed by reading a portion of the play,\r\n“Merchant of Venice,” the committee having previously assigned the\r\ndifferent characters to the members present. We are very social at\r\nour meetings, and occasionally have a little collation at the close\r\nof the exercises. Most of us are well up with the class, and find the\r\nChautauqua evenings not only instructive, but exceedingly enjoyable.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=New York (Angola).=—A local circle was organized here February 5,\r\n1883, and consists of eighteen members. We usually do the reading in\r\nTHE CHAUTAUQUAN at our meetings, information being given, and questions\r\nasked by all. We have made use of the questions and answers in THE\r\nCHAUTAUQUAN, and found them to be of much assistance. Occasionally\r\ntopics are assigned, upon which we are to read or speak at the next\r\nmeeting. Criticism upon pronunciation is unsparingly given to all. We\r\nintend to continue our meetings, and hope that another year may bring\r\nus a larger membership.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=Pennsylvania (Allegheny City).=—In November, 1882, the Woodlawn\r\nsegment of the C. L. S. C. was organized and officers elected. The\r\npresident having drawn up a constitution, it was read and unanimously\r\nadopted. Our constitution regulates the manner of conducting the\r\nsociety, prescribes parliamentary rules, etc. During our study of\r\ngeology, we were favored with an interesting and instructive lecture by\r\nA. M. Martin, Esq., General Secretary of the C. L. S. C. Our membership\r\nnow consists of seventeen persons, six being ladies.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=Pennsylvania (Gillmor).=—Our circle owes its being to the earnest,\r\npersistent efforts of two or three persons who had read one year alone.\r\nThe first meeting was held October 24, 1882, and the circle organized\r\nwith fifteen members. We labor under some peculiar difficulties. Our\r\nmembers represent several little villages, and are so scattered that\r\nit is some times hard to get together. Then we are in the oil country\r\nwhere people stay rather than live, so they gather around them only\r\nsuch things as are needful for comfortable living. The majority have\r\nbut few books of reference, or other helps to study. Our meetings\r\nwere opened with prayer and the singing of a Chautauqua song, and\r\nsometimes repeating the Chautauqua mottoes, any items of business being\r\nattended to before beginning the regular work of the circle. Before\r\nclosing members were appointed by the president to conduct the various\r\nexercises in the succeeding meeting. In the latter part of the winter\r\nthe president proposed a course of lectures. It was a decided success.\r\nOur lecturers were J. T. Edwards, D.D., Randolph, N. Y.—subject:\r\n“Oratory and Eloquence;” D. W. C. Huntington, Bradford, Pa., “Rambles\r\nin Europe;” C. W. Winchester, Buffalo, N. Y., “Eight Wonders of the\r\nWorld.” This course closed with a home entertainment, consisting of\r\nvocal and instrumental music, readings, essays, etc., mostly by members\r\nof the circle. Our number is at present nineteen, and we are happy to\r\nhave proved those to be false prophets who predicted that three months\r\nwould be the limit of our existence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=District of Columbia (Washington).=—The Parker Circle has been\r\nreorganized for the course of 1883-84. Several new members were\r\nreceived, and the circle now numbers about thirty-six. On Tuesday\r\nevening, the 18th, Dr. Dobson, our president, will organize a new\r\ncircle in another part of the city, beginning with a dozen members.\r\nFoundry Circle reorganizes the same night, and several new circles will\r\nbe organized during the fall. There is considerable interest manifested\r\nin the course.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=Maryland (Baltimore).=—The Class of 1887 was organized on Thursday\r\nevening, September 20, at the Young Men’s Christian Association\r\nHall. The membership for the coming year will be about thirty. The\r\nofficers constitute the committee on instruction. The class of the\r\npast year, the fourth since its organization, was one of the best; the\r\nmethod adopted was that of the question box; each member placing such\r\nquestions of interest in the box as he had met with in his reading.\r\nThe director, Prof. J. Rendell Harris, would read the questions one at\r\na time, and open the discussion upon them, in which all joined. Two\r\nmeetings each month from October to June were held, and the entire time\r\nspent on the three books, the rest of the books being used for home\r\nreading only. This plan was considered preferable to the study of two\r\nor three at one time. The outlook for the new class is good.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=Ohio (Harrisburg).=—We have eleven members, of whom ten are regular\r\nmembers of the C. L. S. C. Our method of work thus far has consisted of\r\nessays, readings, and conversations. The interest in the work increases\r\nwith each meeting.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=Illinois (Fairburg).=—We have here a small circle of eight members. We\r\nhave met regularly once a week, taking each study in its course, and\r\nin an informal way have discussed the various subjects presented. Much\r\ninterest has been felt and expressed, and we all feel that a prescribed\r\ncourse of reading is by all means the best and most direct means of\r\nself-culture.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=Illinois (Yorkville).=—For the past two years quite a number of our\r\npeople have pursued the course of studies, but not until last year\r\ndid we see proper to unite with the home society. Our class comprised\r\nlawyers, bankers, insurance agents, carriage trimmers, preachers,\r\nteachers and farmers. All feel that it has been two years of very\r\nprofitable study for us. We closed our last year’s study by a meeting\r\nat the residence of one of the members, where we were entertained by a\r\nprogram consisting of essays, character sketches, class history, music,\r\nand last, but not least, refreshments for the inner man. It was indeed\r\nan enjoyable occasion. We hope to organize a much larger class for the\r\ncoming year.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=Tennessee (Knoxville).=—The local circle at this place reorganized\r\nthis year with a membership of twenty-eight, an increase of twenty\r\nover last year. How was this accomplished? The secret can be given in\r\njust two words: _personal influence_. At the close of last year we\r\nfelt that our circle here was dying. The members were negligent about\r\nthe preparation of lessons, careless and indifferent about attendance,\r\nand we disbanded for the summer feeling almost discouraged, yet in the\r\nheart of each member was a secret determination to do something to\r\nmake the circle more interesting next year. One of our members went\r\nto Monteagle, another to Europe, and another to Chautauqua. Those\r\nwho remained at home worked also for the C. L. S. C., and all worked\r\nearnestly and with enthusiasm. We thought, wrote and talked C. L. S.\r\nC. until our friends laughingly called us “people of one idea.” We\r\nsent for circulars, which we gave to every one whom we could betray\r\ninto the slightest expression of interest. We loaned our books and\r\nmagazine with the request, “please just look it over and tell us what\r\nyou think of it.” The seventh of September we held a meeting at the Y.\r\nM. C. A. rooms, kindly tendered to us for that purpose. All who were\r\ninterested in the C. L. S. C. were invited, and two of the ministers of\r\nour city also encouraged us by their presence and cheering words. Then\r\nwe began to reap the fruits of our summer’s work. Seven new members\r\nwere reported and two more asked for membership. Another meeting was\r\nheld September 21 for reorganization, at which six new names were\r\nreported and five more requested admission to the circle, making our\r\nnumber twenty-eight. The circle will meet once a week, and we hope to\r\naccomplish results worthy of our enthusiasm. We send greeting to our\r\nsister circles, especially to the weak, to whom we would say: _Use your\r\ninfluence_ as a society and as individuals, and _success_ is yours.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=Michigan (Niles).=—Our circle was organized last October, with\r\nthirteen members. We have held thirty-three meetings, at which reviews\r\nupon the topics studied and readings from THE CHAUTAUQUAN have formed\r\npart of the program. In addition, we have read Bryant’s translation of\r\nthe “Iliad,” and “Evangeline.” All the Memorial Days have been kept.\r\nSelections from the author, sketches of his life and home, responses to\r\nroll-call with quotations from the same, and familiar talks upon the\r\nsubject of the memorial, have made these occasions of unusual interest.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=Michigan (Imlay City).=—On Tuesday evening, November 28, 1882, we\r\norganized a local circle of the C. L. S. C. We have eight regular and\r\nthree local members. The meetings have been held once in two weeks,\r\nat the houses of the members, and from the interest manifested in the\r\nwork, we have every reason to hope for a large increase in numbers next\r\nyear. On the evening of February 27 we observed Longfellow’s birthday\r\nby an interesting program of essays, readings, recitations and songs.\r\nWe closed with a sentiment from each one present, from Longfellow.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=Wisconsin (La Crosse).=—A local circle was organized here last\r\nJanuary. The membership is small, but we have been faithful to the\r\nwork. Although we began very late, we have nearly completed the year’s\r\nwork. We are all glad we began such a course of study, and have found\r\nmuch pleasure in gathering round our “round-table.” The prospects for\r\nan increase in numbers and interest for the coming year are encouraging.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=Minnesota (Minneapolis).=—The Centenary Circle has just finished the\r\nwork of the year. Our circle has numbered forty-two in all, with six\r\nlocal members, though six, at least, have been unable to attend the\r\nmeetings on account of distance,—one even living in another State—but\r\nmost are keeping up their work. There has been more interest and\r\nenthusiasm all through the year than during our first year.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=Minnesota (Albert Lea).=—This is the first year of our local circle,\r\nand we number five, all ladies with home cares. We have short sketches\r\nof the “Required History Readings” in THE CHAUTAUQUAN, which we think\r\nmake us remember them better. We are reading the “White Seal Course”\r\naloud, and enjoy it so much. Can not be glad enough that we have taken\r\nup this course.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=Iowa (Muscatine.)=—The Acme Circle is composed of fifty-five members,\r\nwith an average attendance of thirty-five. We are very enthusiastic,\r\nand expect to take the examinations. We recite the lesson, occasionally\r\nreading a part which it does not seem worth while to commit to\r\nmemory. Our exercises are varied by essays on topics of importance in\r\nconnection with the lesson.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=Iowa (St. Charles).=—I wish to report from our town a circle of three\r\n(myself and family). We hold no regular meetings. Although we began the\r\nfirst year’s course late last December, we have completed the reading\r\nup to this month. It has been very profitable and entertaining to us.\r\nWe are each determined to complete the course. We will advertise it\r\nin our county papers, and do our utmost to solicit members and get\r\nup local circles. We do not think any better plan than the C. L. S.\r\nC. could be devised for furnishing those who have not the privilege\r\nof an academic or collegiate course an opportunity to acquire a good\r\npractical education.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=Texas (Palestine.)=—The Houston _Daily Post_ gives the following\r\nhistory of the local circle in Palestine: Some young people and some\r\nadults of Palestine have formed themselves into a branch of the now\r\nworld-renowned Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circle, and have\r\nentered upon the four years’ course of study prescribed by that\r\ninstitution. The circle was organized in October, 1882, and now has a\r\nmembership of twenty-three. Meetings are held every week at the homes\r\nof the members. The evenings thus spent are highly profitable to the\r\nmembers, socially and intellectually. Dr. Yoakum has assisted the\r\ncircle greatly by lectures and talks on geology, astronomy, botany and\r\nhistory. The program of exercises is varied semi-occasionally from the\r\nregular channel, and the evening is spent in purely a literary way.\r\nSuch seasons of refreshment occur on the birth anniversaries of popular\r\nauthors. On the 23d of April a Shakspere memorial meeting was held\r\nat Sterne’s Hotel, on which occasion Mrs. Overall read “The Fall of\r\nCardinal Wolsey.” Miss Kate Colding rendered “Hamlet’s Soliloquy” most\r\nadmirably. Miss Florence Finch presided at the organ and lead in the\r\nChautauqua songs. On May 1 the circle did honor to the life and memory\r\nof Addison. Mrs. J. C. Bradford read a sketch of his life and writings,\r\nMiss Ena Sawyers read “The Omnipresence and Omniscience of the Deity,”\r\nand Miss Fannie Reese read “The Vision of Mirza.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=California (Brooklyn).=—Our circle is an informal quartet of congenial\r\nspirits who have been close friends and companions for some time past.\r\nWe meet every Monday evening and have a delightful free and easy\r\ndiscussion over what we have read during the week, with Webster’s\r\nUnabridged in its post of honor—the piano stool, and the encyclopædia\r\nrack within reachable distance. We are enjoying the course very much,\r\nand feel that it is just what we need.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO CONDUCT A LOCAL CIRCLE.[I]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TROY METHOD OF ORGANIZING A CIRCLE.\r\n\r\nThe “Rock of Ages” was sung, a prayer was offered by Mr. Martin, after\r\nwhich Mr. Farrar said:\r\n\r\nI desire to give you a little history of the inauguration of our circle\r\nwork in Troy. I do so because I am confident that what was done there\r\nlast year may be done in every city, in every village, and may be\r\nmultiplied a thousand times.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of last September I wrote an article on “Reading,\r\nCircles for Reading, and The C. L. S. C.,” and published it in the Troy\r\n_Daily Times_.\r\n\r\nI wrote this article, published it on Wednesday, calling a meeting\r\nat my church for Thursday evening, inviting anybody and everybody\r\nwho desired, to be present. The evening was quite unfavorable. I\r\nexpected about twenty. I was exceedingly surprised and gratified in the\r\ninterests of the C. L. S. C. work when I found nearly three hundred\r\npeople present. Being inspired by their presence, I began to talk to\r\nthem on reading, the importance of it, the value of it to-day, and the\r\ncheapness of literature. I unfolded to them the C. L. S. C. plan, the\r\nnumbers that were taking it up, the enthusiasm that prevailed here at\r\nChautauqua, and how the Circle was spreading all over the world, not\r\nonly in this country but in other countries. It was all new to many of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of my half hour’s talk I asked how many persons\r\nwanted to join some such circle as this. About every hand in the\r\naudience went up. I was surprised again. Looking over the audience,\r\nI knew nearly every one of them, for I was back the second time as\r\npastor of the same church, and knowing that four or five denominations\r\nwere represented there, I suggested that there ought to be a circle in\r\nevery church. I did not want to “scoop up” the whole right there in\r\nour church, and I was generous enough to say that there ought to be a\r\ndozen circles established in our city, one in connection with every\r\nchurch, and in the suburbs. I said that a week from that night we would\r\norganize a circle there, and any who desired to be connected with that\r\ncircle would be gladly welcomed.\r\n\r\nDuring the week I received several letters from parties in the city,\r\nand out of the city, asking about the C. L. S. C., what its course\r\nof reading was, etc. I followed it in the _Daily Times_ with another\r\nletter on Wednesday, saying that our circle was to meet on Thursday,\r\nand explaining the text books that we were to take up for the year,\r\nand more fully entering into the C. L. S. C. idea. Our evening came,\r\nand we had over three hundred present. I had the whole list of books\r\nwith me. I took them up and showed them to each person. I said, “this\r\nis the course.” I went on unfolding the whole idea of the course, the\r\namount of time each year, the examinations at the end of the year,\r\nand the outlook of the four years’ course. I told them that this was\r\nthe student’s outlook from college halls, with the exception of the\r\nmathematics and the languages to be translated.\r\n\r\nThen I asked how many desired to join this Circle. Over two hundred\r\nhands went up. Immediately we fell to organization. Fortunately,\r\nor unfortunately, I was elected president, and a Protestant\r\nEpiscopal clergyman, rector of Christ Church, close by me, was\r\nelected vice-president. We have in our organization a president,\r\nvice-president, secretary, treasurer, and a board of managers\r\nconsisting of five.\r\n\r\nI found on inspecting the number that joined our circle that we\r\nwere about equally divided Baptists, Protestant Episcopalians,\r\nPresbyterians, and Methodist Episcopalians. Our board of managers\r\nwas wisely selected from these various churches, so that there might\r\nbe the largest remove possible from anything like an organization\r\nconfined to our church. I say this because I believe that people are\r\nhungry for just such an organization as this. There are thousands in\r\nour communities who are tired of idle gossip. They want something to\r\ntalk about, and the only way to stop gossip is to put something into\r\ntheir heads on a higher plane. I have had testimony from our members\r\nrepeatedly, “Now we have so little time to talk about these other\r\nthings.” Whenever they come together they talk about these wonders\r\nfound in the C. L. S. C. work.\r\n\r\nThis board of five managers arranges our monthly plan. Our large\r\nmeetings are monthly. Our circle divides itself up; six or a dozen, or\r\ntwenty, form little organizations, read together, meet once a week, and\r\nthen we meet as a large circle monthly and review our work. This board\r\nof managers lays out the month’s work. The first week after our monthly\r\nmeeting this board of managers is called together. They make out their\r\nplan, print it on a postal card, and send it out at once to every\r\nmember of the circle, so that every member knows what the plan is to be\r\nthree weeks before the meeting. Our method in the large meeting is to\r\nreview our work by the essay method.\r\n\r\nLet me give you a program. First, singing. I was fortunate enough to\r\nhave an enthusiastic singer in our number, and I gave him the work of\r\norganizing a glee club. He gathered twenty or twenty-five of the very\r\nbest young people in the number, and formed a glee club, and they led\r\nour devotions. We followed with scripture and prayer. And then began\r\nour essays. We usually have three, four, sometimes five essays, and no\r\nessay is over ten minutes in length. We desire that the essays shall\r\nnot exceed eight minutes. It requires a deal of skill and practice to\r\nreduce our thoughts on a subject to a six or eight minutes essay, but\r\nit is practicable. Then we are all interested in the subject which we\r\nhave been studying for a month. When an individual rises and reads, we\r\nfeel that we have gone over the same subject, and it is like a review\r\nto us, and helps to fasten it more definitely in our minds. Following\r\neach essay we have remarks and questions. We never criticise an essay.\r\nThat would be unkind. You could not do it. You would intimidate\r\neverybody.\r\n\r\nWe ask questions and throw in additional remarks. We take up half an\r\nhour, or three-quarters at most, devoted to the three, four or five\r\nessays. Following these we appoint some person to ask the questions\r\nwhich are printed in THE CHAUTAUQUAN. Any person who will ask and\r\nanswer these questions will find that he has a wonderfully clear\r\n_résumé_ of the whole subject in his mind. I suppose that we are\r\nindebted to Mr. Martin for them. They are very clear, very concise, and\r\ngreatly appreciated by the Troy members.\r\n\r\nFollowing these questions we have a recess of twenty minutes, in which\r\nit is the custom of our circle to shake hands, make each others’\r\nacquaintance, encourage each other, find out about each other, and\r\ninquire about the work. Upon the recall the Glee Club gives a song.\r\nThen follows the round-table. I need not explain this because you are\r\nall familiar with the round-table. After that a _conversazione_ on some\r\nprominent character of the world, old or new. We desire that every\r\nmember will give us some extract of five lines, not to exceed five\r\nlines, unless it would break the harmony of the thought, from every\r\nperson brought before us. We have had Shakspere, Longfellow, Bryant,\r\nand a variety of persons.\r\n\r\nImmediately after this _conversazione_ follows “a miscellaneous\r\nexercise”—anything that needs to be taken up. While we were studying\r\ngeology, we went down to the village of Albany where the capital is\r\nlocated. They have a very fine series of geological rooms arranged by\r\nProf. Hall, the State Geologist. As you enter the room, there are the\r\nvery lowest specimens of the rocks with their fossils. As you go up\r\nstory after story you reach the highest rocks. Prof. Hall, by previous\r\nappointment, met our large circle of about two hundred. We chartered\r\na car or two and went down. He met us and gave us a very satisfactory\r\nlecture. We appreciated it.\r\n\r\nWhen we came to astronomy, we found out where we could find an\r\nastronomer. We invited him, and he came and gave us a lecture. Then\r\nwe had a teacher of the high school stand before us, and allow us to\r\nquestion him to our heart’s content. We found it available to work in\r\nall the outside force possible. When we studied the subject of art we\r\ngot together all the pictures of the town that we could find. I was in\r\nGloversville as pastor at that time. We arranged them, and spent two or\r\nthree very delightful evenings. You have two or three, another has one,\r\nanother has six; bring them all together and discuss the whole subject\r\nof art. We found it very profitable.\r\n\r\nIn Troy our circle is so enthusiastic in its work that there is a\r\nconstant clamor of outside people to get in. We sometimes allow a few\r\noutsiders, and there is hardly a session that we do not have four to\r\nfive hundred in our gathering, but the front seats are always reserved\r\nfor members, and visitors, if there be any, must take the back seats.\r\nThere are anywhere from fifty to one hundred and fifty clamoring to be\r\nadmitted into the circle this fall. I do not know what we shall do. If\r\nwe admit them, we shall go into the audience room. I think it is better\r\nto divide up.\r\n\r\nI have given you our work. I said in the outset, it is possible for\r\nany young man or woman, pastor or superintendent, through your village\r\npaper, to write a short article calling the attention of the people to\r\nit, saying that in such a place there will be an organization of this\r\nwork. I have the impression that you can gather quite a large circle\r\nin every place, two or three of them. But my conviction is from the\r\nwork as I have observed it through Troy and vicinity, that you need\r\nsomebody in that circle, at the head of it, who loves it. You can make\r\nnothing in this world grow without love. Not even the flowers you may\r\nplant in your garden will grow unless you love them.\r\n\r\nAs the result of the article in the Troy _Times_, eight circles were\r\norganized in our city. As the result of those two articles, twenty-six\r\ncircles were organized around Troy.\r\n\r\nI would be glad to hear from you to-day. Criticise my plan as much as\r\nyou please. I have taken more time because Dr. Vincent urged me to do\r\nso. He urged me to take twenty-five minutes. I have only taken twenty.\r\nGive me your plans, any suggestions, any practical idea that you have\r\nworked out in your circles.\r\n\r\nMR. MARTIN: I can say that I commend every feature that has been\r\nmentioned here by Mr. Farrar in the method of conducting local circles.\r\nI believe we have tested in Pittsburgh every one he has mentioned.\r\nThere are several others we have tried, to which I would like to refer.\r\nFor instance, I think it well for persons to start with the inspiration\r\nand a love of the Circle right here at Chautauqua. A great many persons\r\nhave come to me on the ground, and asked me how to form a local circle,\r\nsaying they had no local circles in their vicinity. I say to them if\r\nthey have two or three members on the ground here who belong together\r\nin a circle, meet under the trees and start your organization here. We\r\nstarted with seven members under these trees by the Hall of Philosophy,\r\nin the year 1878, and we had somewhere between three and four hundred\r\nbefore the following January, and have as many more since. Last year\r\nabout half a dozen who graduated in the class of ’82 met under the\r\ntrees here, and we formed our preliminary organization. We carried\r\nthe spirit and love of the C. L. S. C. home with us, and we formed in\r\nPittsburgh an alumni association of nearly sixty members. We expect to\r\nincrease the number largely during the coming year.\r\n\r\nOne word with reference to the use of newspapers. Our executive\r\ncommittee apportion the different papers of the city between them. We\r\nhave five members, and each member looks after a paper to see that the\r\npaper looks after C. L. S. C. matters. We make each member the editor\r\nof a C. L. S. C. department in a newspaper, and it is his duty to get\r\nin as many notices about the C. L. S. C. as possible. Our press has\r\nvery generously opened to us its columns. Every monthly meeting is\r\nnoticed before and after in the papers. I am glad to say that we have\r\ngot into many considerable controversies in the newspapers. We like\r\nthem because they bring our organization into notice.\r\n\r\nWe avail ourselves of the papyrograph, the electric pen, the type\r\nwriter, and the various plans for duplicating that we now have, in the\r\nway of sending out notices, preparing the programs, etc. Any of you who\r\nknow how cheaply any of these appliances can be used for printing, will\r\nsee how efficiently they can be employed for the use of the circle.\r\n\r\nAnother point: If we get a little depressed, or a little behind, we\r\nget Dr. Vincent or one of the counselors to come and give us a rousing\r\nlecture. We have given them good audiences, and they have spread a\r\nnew enthusiasm. What an amount of enthusiasm can be developed about\r\nthe C. L. S. C. If you will have the patience to answer clearly and\r\nfully all questions that are asked you about the C. L. S. C., you will\r\nfind that you are doing a grand missionary work. I know my business\r\nis often interrupted by people who come in and ask about the C. L. S.\r\nC., but I am always sorry if I ever have to turn any one away without\r\ninformation. If I give them full information, and they go away and join\r\nthe C. L. S. C., and form a local circle afterward, I feel that I have\r\ndone a missionary work.\r\n\r\nMR. FARRAR: Any suggestions?\r\n\r\nA VOICE: Did you permit persons to become members of your local circle\r\nwho did not belong to the parent society?\r\n\r\nMR. FARRAR: Yes. But we requested them, if they did not wish to take up\r\nthe full course of reading, to join the C. L. S. C. and pay their fifty\r\ncents, and take THE CHAUTAUQUAN. We honored the home office. But they\r\nneed not fill out the questions unless they choose.\r\n\r\nMR. BRIDGE: In that way you will get a great many members of the C. L.\r\nS. C. who are not doing the work.\r\n\r\nMR. FARRAR: Very few. We took a few husbands who wanted to come with\r\ntheir wives. “Very good,” I said, “pay your fifty cents and take THE\r\nCHAUTAUQUAN.”\r\n\r\nREV. J. O. FOSTER: We had a large circle where I was last appointed.\r\nWe found in the school a man well posted in geology. We found the\r\ndepot agent was an astronomer, and he was very enthusiastic over the\r\ninvitation that we gave him. He came down and spattered the blackboard\r\nall over with facts. He got a long strip of paper and stuck up around\r\nthe room, and marked out the planets. He gave us a very fine lecture on\r\nastronomy, so good that the people requested him to repeat it before\r\nthe whole congregation. We had this “jelly-pad business,” and struck\r\noff our programs the week before. Every one knew what he was expected\r\nto do. We secured plenty of books, if any one was at a loss for books.\r\nWe had about twenty in the circle, and that circle is now running. I\r\nthink it is three and a half years old. I do not know of any older than\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nMR. MARTIN: We have one five years old.\r\n\r\nMR. FOSTER: Very good. Dr. Goodfellow organized this. Another member\r\nand I went to people in the city and asked them to lend us their\r\npictures upon several subjects. You will be astonished at the amount of\r\nmaterial you can gather together in a single afternoon to illustrate\r\nany subject.\r\n\r\nDR. VINCENT: I have no doubt that some small local circles have quite\r\nunique plans which they have adopted, and I hope if they hesitate to\r\nspeak out, that they will write out their plans for us.\r\n\r\nA LADY: I was about to speak for a small circle. I am very positive\r\nin our circle of twenty it would be almost impossible to have essays,\r\nexcept occasionally. The members generally would be so frightened at\r\nthe idea of having to write an essay that we should lose the circle\r\nentirely. We have to pet them a little, and we use the conversational\r\nmethod as freely as possible to get them to express themselves. What\r\nthey can not tell we tell them. In my experience—I have been conductor\r\nfour years—I find the essay method frightens small circles. Where you\r\nhave circles of two hundred, where they have a great many ministers,\r\nand lawyers, you can get them to write essays.\r\n\r\nA LADY: I would say that I belong to a circle out West of six members.\r\nWe pursued the essay work for the first two years entirely. Every one\r\nof us for the first two years wrote an essay every week. [Applause.]\r\n\r\nDR. EATON: I would like to speak for another small circle. We had a\r\nprogram. We opened with singing and prayer, and then the leader, who\r\nhad prepared himself thoroughly, or tried to prepare himself thoroughly\r\non the lesson, particularly in science and in history, examined every\r\nclass by questioning and removing every difficulty connected with\r\nthem. The whole circle replied at once, answering the questions. If\r\nthere were any in the circle that could not answer a question, they\r\nhad it answered for them, and were not placed under any embarrassment\r\nby the sense of failure. A great many said of these meetings every two\r\nweeks, that they obtained a better knowledge by this thorough drill\r\nthan by reading privately at home. Likewise we had essays, but not very\r\nfrequently. We had essays in the first part of the evening. Sometimes\r\nthere was a failure to respond, but generally the subject was assigned\r\nto particular individuals, and a great many facts in connection with\r\nthe difficulties in history were brought in that way. I think we\r\ncommenced with a circle of about twenty or thirty, and we graduated\r\nhere a year ago some sixteen members, I think. And others are coming\r\nin, but with what success I am unable to say, as I have not been in\r\nthat place all the time. I think that every one in that circle would\r\nbear testimony that in this way—by close examination, the plan of a\r\nregular class drill—we have obtained a better knowledge than in any\r\nother way, and that they were satisfied at the end of the year they\r\nhad accomplished more and better work than they would under any other\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nA VOICE: I would like to say we consider that the writing of these\r\nessays and insisting upon it, was as much for the advantage of the\r\npersons writing these essays as for that of those who listened to them.\r\nTherefore, we had a critic who was to write the criticisms, and had\r\nthem read by the president. Do you think that was a good way?\r\n\r\nMR. FARRAR: We thought it was not the best way. Dr. Vincent suggests\r\nthat the criticisms might be given privately to the writer. I found it\r\nquite difficult to get essays. Many young ladies and gentlemen looked\r\nupon it as a fearful task. Many times I had to call on them, and sit\r\ndown with them, and talk them into it, showing them how they could do\r\nit. And never one wrote an essay in our circle but said “When you want\r\nme to write an essay, call on me again.” I have tried a dozen others\r\nwho persisted in refusing, but at the close of the year they came to\r\nme and said: “If you will forgive us for our refusing to write you may\r\ncall upon us next year.”\r\n\r\nAfter singing, the benediction was pronounced by Dr. Vincent.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[I] Round-Table held in the Hall of Philosophy, at Chautauqua, August\r\n16th, 1883, conducted by Rev.

J.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAUTAUQUA NORMAL CLASS—BIBLE SECTION.\r\n\r\n_Twelve Lessons on Bible Themes._\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON I.—THE DIVINE REVELATION.\r\n\r\nI. There is in me a something which is called mind. I do not know what\r\nit is. I can neither tell whence it came, nor whither it will go when\r\nit ceases to inhabit this body. That in me, which is thus ignorant\r\nconcerning the mind, is the mind itself. There are therefore matters\r\nbeyond my mental range. That is, my mind is limited, bounded, finite\r\nin its powers. What is true of my mind is true of all human mind. Here\r\nthen is one of the first results of consciousness: FINITE MIND IN THE\r\nWORLD.\r\n\r\nII. This finite mind did not produce itself; it sees in the body which\r\nit controls evidence of a design of which it is not the author. It\r\nturns to the phenomena of the universe and discovers in them the same\r\nevidences of design. It seeks the attributes and character of the\r\ndesigner or designers of human body and of natural phenomena, and finds\r\nthem to be unlimited in action, unbounded by time or space, infinite in\r\npower, and uniform in manifestation. It therefore concludes that there\r\nis but one designer of all the phenomena of created nature, and that\r\nhe is both intelligent and infinite. Here then is a second result of\r\nconsciousness: INFINITE MIND IN THE UNIVERSE.\r\n\r\nIII. We have so far brought to view two powers, infinite mind in the\r\nuniverse and finite mind in the world, and between them a distance\r\nimmeasurable and impassable from the finite side. They are extremes in\r\nthe progression of the universe. Let us notice some facts concerning\r\neach of these powers:\r\n\r\n1. The infinite mind is self-existent; eternal.\r\n\r\n2. The infinite mind created finite mind in its own likeness. Both\r\nthese points will be considered in our lesson on the “Doctrines of the\r\nBible.”\r\n\r\n3. The infinite mind has _provided a means of passing the distance\r\nbetween itself and the finite mind_, so that the finite might know the\r\ninfinite; i. e. it has revealed itself to the finite mind.\r\n\r\n4. The finite mind is the highest created existence. This is left\r\nwithout discussion for the student to amplify.\r\n\r\n5. The finite mind exists because of the infinite mind. The gas jet\r\nburning above my head affords an illustration. It exists because of a\r\nwell-stored gasometer two miles away; because of complicated machinery\r\nby which coal has been caused to yield up its hidden stores of light;\r\nbecause of a system of underground conductors that terminates in\r\nthe burner on the wall. Without the burner and the light all these\r\nappliances would be useless; and they in turn exist only that there\r\nmay be light. So the finite mind exists because of the infinite—nor\r\ncan we think with satisfaction of infinite mind in the universe and no\r\ncreation or correlated force.\r\n\r\n6. The finite mind hungers to know the infinite; it peers into the\r\nmeasureless space which its eye can not pierce, and longs for the\r\ninfinite to reveal itself. This fact is historical, “Canst thou by\r\nsearching find out God?” has been the question of the ages; and\r\nthe answer has been “the world by wisdom knew not God.” The cry of\r\nmultitudes of hungering souls has been: “O, that I knew where I might\r\nfind him.” As light is necessary to the eye, and air to the bird’s\r\nwing, and sound to the ear, that each may perform the work for which\r\nit is adapted, so a knowledge of the infinite mind that is of God, is\r\nessential that the finite mind—that is, man—may fulfill its destiny.\r\nAnd this knowledge is possible only through self-revelation by God to\r\nman. That such a revelation has been made we have already asserted.\r\nThat the Bible is that revelation is our claim, which we will discuss\r\nin a future lesson. The present lesson will be content to inquire\r\nsimply, how that revelation has been effected. We answer:\r\n\r\n_God wrought it out in the presence of the race_ in ways unmistakable,\r\nexhibiting every attribute of his character, _even to those of mercy\r\nand forgiveness_. God wrought (not wrote). What we call the inspired\r\nWord is a mediate, not an immediate act of God. God wrought, the work\r\nextending through many ages, perhaps not even yet finished.\r\n\r\n_Wrought_ (_a_) in nature, so that “the invisible things of him since\r\nthe creation of the world are clearly seen, being perceived through\r\nthe things that are made.” Creation then is itself a part of the\r\nrevelation, but only a part; for out of it comes no hint of forgiveness\r\nor redemption.\r\n\r\n(_b_) In man, _by spiritual manifestations_, _by intellectual\r\nenlightenments_, _by illuminations of conscience_, such as could not\r\noriginate in the human soul. These revelations or workings of God in\r\nman mark a large portion of the history of thought through the ages;\r\nand in that dim twilight of the race, when men like Enoch walked with\r\nGod, though history is but a shadow, yet it is the shadow of God\r\nworking in man.\r\n\r\n(_c_) In Providence—that is, in his ordering the work of the world. He\r\nnot only “produced a supernatural history extending through centuries,\r\n... and working out results which human wisdom could never have\r\nconceived, nor human power executed,”[J] but also he has directed all\r\nthe workings of all history in accordance with the central purpose of\r\nhis revelation.\r\n\r\n(_d_) In grace, by his spirit revealing what the human mind could\r\nnever have discovered for itself, redemption and atonement through\r\nforgiveness of sin.\r\n\r\nIV. This divine revelation so wrought by God _has been, and is being\r\nreported_ that all the world may know and confess that “the Lord, he is\r\nthe God.” Reported:\r\n\r\n1. _Through Tradition._—There was an unwritten Bible before the\r\nwritten word, handed down from patriarchs to scribes; and even in\r\nlands destitute of the Scriptures, we trace the dim outlines of truth\r\ntransmitted from ancient authority.\r\n\r\n2. _Through Philosophy._—Wise men and thinkers have read the revelation\r\nin nature and gathered it up from human thought, and the highest\r\nphilosophy, as that of a Socrates and a Plato, finds God.\r\n\r\n3. _Through Prophecy._—In the earlier ages, and perhaps through all the\r\nages, God has communed with chosen men who have lived in fellowship\r\nwith himself; and has made them the mouthpiece uttering his will to the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n4. _Through Preaching._—The pulpit, when it is true to its mission,\r\nvoices the message of God to man.\r\n\r\nV. _We find also that this divine revelation has been written out,\r\nunder a divine direction_:\r\n\r\n1. _In Various Books._—The Bible is not one book, but sixty-six books,\r\na whole library, presenting the divine revelation under varied aspects,\r\nbut all under one divine origin and supervision.\r\n\r\n2. _By Various Writers._—Not less than thirty authors, and probably\r\nmany more, shared in the composition of the Scriptures, but all wrote\r\nunder a divine control, and expressed, each in his own style, the mind\r\nof the Spirit.\r\n\r\n3. _Through Various Ages._—Moses may have begun the writing, doubtless\r\nfrom earlier documents. Samuel, David, Solomon, Isaiah, Ezra, Matthew,\r\nPaul, John, each in turn carried on the work through a period of\r\nsixteen hundred years. The book grew like a cathedral, rising through\r\nthe centuries, under many successive master-builders, yet according to\r\none plan of one divine Architect.\r\n\r\n4. _In Various Languages._—Two great tongues, one Semitic, the other\r\nAryan, were employed, the Hebrew in the Old Testament, the Greek in the\r\nnew; but the Hebrew of Moses is not that of Daniel a thousand years\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nVI. _We find this divine revelation preserved_:\r\n\r\n1. _By being stereotyped into Dead Languages._—A living language is\r\never changing the meaning of its words; and truth written in it is in\r\ndanger of being misunderstood by another generation. But the words of\r\na dead language, like the Hebrew and the Greek, are fixed in their\r\nmeaning, and once understood are not likely to be perverted. Soon after\r\nthe Bible was completed, both its languages ceased to be spoken, and\r\nhave been kept since as the shrine for the great truths contained in\r\nthe Word.\r\n\r\n2. _By being translated into Living Languages._—The Bible has been\r\ntranslated into all the tongues of earth, and thus its perpetuation\r\nto the end of time has been assured. No other work has been read by\r\nso many races, and no other is so capable of being understood by the\r\nmasses of mankind.\r\n\r\n3. _By being incorporated into Literature._—If every copy of the\r\nScriptures in the whole world were destroyed every sentence of it could\r\nbe reproduced from the writings of men, since it has become an integral\r\npart of the thought of the world.\r\n\r\n4. _By being perpetuated in Institutions._—The Jewish church\r\nperpetuates the Old Testament; the Christian church the New; and while\r\neither endures, the Bible containing the divine revelation must endure.\r\n\r\nVII. _We find this divine revelation proved_:\r\n\r\n1. _By Testimonies._—The child looking upon the opened page of the\r\nBible at his mother’s knee, accepts her testimony that it is the word\r\nof God, and thus each generation receives the book from the preceding\r\ngeneration with a declaration of its divine origin.\r\n\r\n2. _By Probabilities._—Such has been the history of this book in its\r\nrelation to the world, and its triumph over opposing forces; such has\r\nbeen its early, continuous and present acceptance; that there is every\r\nprobability in favor of its being, what it appears to be, a divine book.\r\n\r\n3. _By Experience._—There are many who have put this book to the test\r\nin their own lives; have tried its promises; have tasted its spiritual\r\nexperience; have brought it into contact with their own hearts; and\r\nhave obtained from it a certain assurance that it comes from God.\r\n\r\n4. _By Evidences._—If any reader will not accept the Bible upon the\r\ntestimonies of others; if he fails to see in its behalf the weight of\r\nprobability; if he has not been able to put it to the test in his own\r\nexperience, there is yet a strong line of argument appealing to his\r\nreason, and proving the book divine.\r\n\r\nVIII. _We find this divine revelation searched_:\r\n\r\n1. _Through Curiosity._—There are some who read and study the Bible\r\nfrom no higher motive than desire to know its contents.\r\n\r\n2. _Through Literary Taste._—There are others who read the Bible from\r\nan appreciation of its value as a work of literature, recognizing the\r\nhigh poetic rank of David and Isaiah, the historic worth of Joshua and\r\nSamuel, the philosophic thought of Paul.\r\n\r\n3. _Through Opposition._—In every age there have been searchers of the\r\nBible actuated by the motive of unbelief; men trying to find in it the\r\nweapons for its own destruction. Yet even their study has often proved\r\nserviceable to the believer in the divine revelation.\r\n\r\n4. _Through Spiritual Desire._—Multitudes have studied the Bible,\r\nmultitudes are studying it now because they find in it that which their\r\nspiritual nature craves, the knowledge of God. They feed upon the Word\r\nbecause it satisfies the hunger of their spirits.\r\n\r\nIX. We find this _divine revelation circulated among men_. The history\r\nof the Bible since its translation into English has been the history\r\nof multiplication. Language after language has had the Bible added to\r\nthe library of its language. Unwritten languages have had characters\r\ninvented for them to represent their words and the Bible has thus\r\nbecome the first book of the new-made written language of the people.\r\nAll the leading languages of the world have thus been put in possession\r\nof the Bible, and the signs of the times point to a speedy realization\r\nof the hope that soon all the nations of the earth will know the divine\r\nrevelation of our Father which is in heaven.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAUTAUQUA NORMAL CLASS.\r\n\r\n_Twelve Lessons on the Sunday-school and the Teacher’s Work._\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON I.—THE PLACE, PURPOSE AND PREROGATIVES OF THE SUNDAY-SCHOOL.\r\n\r\n\r\n_I. The place of the Sunday-school._\r\n\r\n1. The Sunday-school is one of the means employed by the Church of\r\nChrist for bringing men under the influence of the Gospel. It is not\r\ndesigned to fill the place of any of the other accepted agencies of the\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\n2. The Sunday-school does not, and should not accomplish the work\r\nbelonging to the pulpit and the pastor, nor does it subserve the\r\npurpose of the church meeting for prayer and interchange of Christian\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\n3. The Sunday-school can in no sense do the work of the Christian home.\r\nIt is an agency differing from all other agencies of the church, and is\r\nmade necessary by the nature and extent of the body of truth accepted\r\nby the church, so necessary that without it the church would be to a\r\ncertain extent crippled.\r\n\r\n4. It is a school, _organized and officered as such_; occupying a well\r\ndefined place in the religious system of the church, having a specific\r\npurpose, and entitled to certain prerogatives.\r\n\r\n5. As a school, its constituency is a body of teachers and pupils,\r\nassociated together voluntarily, but not without responsibility and\r\naccountability.\r\n\r\n6. The Sunday-school in its theoretic constitution is the parallel of\r\nthe secular school.\r\n\r\n(_a_) As the latter derives its life from the community, so the\r\nSunday-school derives its life from _the religious community, the\r\nchurch_.\r\n\r\n(_b_) As the community delegates the power of control over the secular\r\nschool to a representative body which exercises supreme authority over\r\nits affairs, so the church entrusts the management of the Sunday-school\r\nto her representative executive body, by whatever name known.\r\n\r\n(_c_) As the representative body controlling the secular school places\r\nthe oversight of the system and its details of management in the hands\r\nof a general executive officer, or superintendent, so the governing\r\npower of the church entrusts the management of the Sunday-school to one\r\nof similar name—a superintendent.\r\n\r\n(_d_) As the secular school is within and subordinate to the\r\ncommunity, and alongside of the home as its aid and supplement, so the\r\nSunday-school is within and subordinate to the church, and beside the\r\nChristian home as its supplement.\r\n\r\nLet us gather up these propositions concerning the Sunday-school into a\r\ngeneral definition.\r\n\r\n_Definition._\r\n\r\nThe Sunday-school is a department of the church of Christ, in which the\r\nword of Christ is taught for the purpose of bringing souls to Christ\r\nand building up souls in Christ.\r\n\r\nAs suggested by this definition, we make the following propositions:\r\n\r\n(1) The Sunday-school is a _school_.\r\n\r\n(2) The Sunday-school is not a substitute for the church.\r\n\r\n(3) The Sunday-school is not a substitute for the prayer meeting.\r\n\r\n(4) The Sunday-school is not a substitute for home training.\r\n\r\n(5) The Sunday-school is _in_ the church as an integral part.\r\n\r\n(6) The Sunday-school is subordinate to the church.\r\n\r\n(7) The Sunday-school is an aid to the Christian home.\r\n\r\n_II. The Purpose of the Sunday-school._\r\n\r\n1. The chief purpose of the Sunday-school is the _spiritual education_\r\nof the soul. By education we do not mean the mere putting in possession\r\nof knowledge. There have been learned men who were not educated men;\r\nmen of wide knowledge, but with the power of _self-control_ and\r\n_self-use_ undeveloped. By education we mean leading the soul out\r\nof its natural condition, into a condition where it can do what God\r\nmeant it to do, and be what God meant it to be. Spiritual education\r\nwill therefore be the development of a soul by nature averse to divine\r\ncontrol, into a condition of oneness with the divine will, such as\r\nis made possible by the at-one-ment of Jesus Christ. This process\r\ninvolves, (1) conversion, and (2) upbuilding in Christ, and would\r\nproduce, if unhindered, a character that would reach toward the measure\r\nof the fulness of Christ.\r\n\r\nBut many souls in the church have never reached farther than the first\r\nor preparatory step in spiritual education—the step which we call\r\nconversion. Hence,\r\n\r\n2. A second purpose of the Sunday-school is upbuilding in Christ, and\r\nthis is possible only through searching study of the Word of God.\r\n\r\nAs the astronomer must know all the intricacies of his science, and\r\nbe able with the telescope to read the heavens as an open book, and\r\nscan their farthest depths, so the Christian must know the hidden\r\nmysteries and deep things of God as revealed in the Bible, which is\r\nboth text-book and telescope to the soul.\r\n\r\n3. A third purpose of the Sunday-school is the development of the\r\nteaching power in the church. “Go teach,” in the Revised version\r\nbecomes “Go disciple.” Sunday-school teaching therefore becomes\r\n_disciple-making_. In this respect its aim is the same as that of\r\nthe church. To accomplish it by preaching, the church provides years\r\nof careful training for her ministers in special schools. As careful\r\ntraining is needed by the Sunday-school teacher, and the school itself\r\nis the only means by which the end can be secured.\r\n\r\n_III. The Prerogatives of the Sunday-school._\r\n\r\nThe Sunday-school exists within the church and because of the church.\r\nYet though a part of the church, it maintains a separate organic\r\nlife. As a member of the body it has certain _rights_ which we call\r\nPrerogatives. We name the most important.\r\n\r\n1. _Care._—As no member of the body can be neglected without physical\r\nloss, so if any part of the body of Christ be left without watchful\r\ncare, spiritual loss must ensue. The Sunday-school has a _right to\r\nthe care_ of the church, exercised (_a_) officially by the governing\r\nbody, that no want may be left unsupplied, and (_b_) individually that\r\nsympathy, help, prayer and interest may never be lacking, and that\r\nample provision may be made for the efficient working of the school.\r\n\r\n2. _Support._—The Sunday-school has a right to the pecuniary support\r\nof the church. It never should be crippled by lack of means to carry\r\nout its plans. The school should not be expected to provide for its own\r\nnecessary expenses. The voluntary contributions of the school should\r\nnever be applied to the support of the school as such. Systematic\r\ngiving should be taught, and should include all the benevolent\r\noperations of the church, even to the extent of contributing toward the\r\ngeneral church expenses, but that the school should use its funds for\r\ndefraying its own expenses is clearly an evil.\r\n\r\n(3) _Recognition._—The school has a right to be recognized as an\r\nestablished agency of the church. This recognition should include (1)\r\nregular notice from the pulpit of the time and place of holding its\r\nsessions; (2) the same prominence to the annual meeting for the choice\r\nof officers that is given to the same meetings of the church, and (3)\r\nits importance as a church agency should be recognized by giving to the\r\nschool official recognition in the governing body of the church.\r\n\r\n(4) _Pastoral Supervision._—The school has a right to the watchful\r\noversight and regular presence of the pastor. It is not necessary that\r\nhe should superintend the school—it is better not. It is not necessary\r\nthat he should be burdened with its cares. But it is essential (1)\r\nthat he use it as a field of pastoral labor; (2) that he give to it\r\nthe encouragement of his commendation; (3) that he extend to it the\r\nsympathy of his presence; (4) that he know as to the character of the\r\nwork being done within it.\r\n\r\n(5) _Coöperation._—The Sunday-school has a right to the hearty\r\ncoöperation of the whole church, so that (1) there may be no lack of\r\nteachers to do the work of the school, and (2) that the work of the\r\nteacher may be understood and appreciated in the Christian family,\r\nwhich is the church unit; and (3) that teacher and parent may work in\r\nperfect harmony.\r\n\r\nThis is not intended as an exhaustive treatment of this subject. It\r\npresents in outline some salient points concerning the Sunday-school,\r\nand leaves the student to continue by himself the line of thought\r\nsuggested, and to this end reference is made to “Hart’s Thoughts on\r\nSunday-schools,” “Pardee’s Sunday-school Index,” and the “Chautauqua\r\nNormal Guide,” by J. H. Vincent, D.D., 1880.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[J] J. H. Vincent, D.D.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDITOR’S OUTLOOK.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HAYGOOD’S BATTLE FOR THE NEGRO.\r\n\r\nThere is something sublime in the spectacle of an earnest man\r\ncontending for his cause. The sublimity is heightened when we remember\r\nthat his cause and his convictions are identical, without any reckoning\r\nof the cost. Of this character was the figure of Dr. Atticus G. Haygood\r\non the Chautauqua platform, uttering brave words for the Negro, his\r\nformer slave, but present fellow-citizen. Nor did we have to wait till\r\nopportunity made him heard at Chautauqua. From the close of the war\r\nuntil now, he has been a moulder and leader of the best sentiment in\r\nthe South, and has occupied advanced ground upon all questions relating\r\nto the education and welfare of the liberated slave. His recent book,\r\n“Our Brother in Black,” is the ablest contribution we have had to the\r\n“Negro question.” It breathes throughout the same generous, Christian\r\nsentiment and sympathy that characterize all his utterances and his\r\nwork elsewhere. Nor is the word “battle” too strong a term to be\r\nused. When we remember the jealousies, hates, and prejudices of long\r\nstanding, and greatly intensified by the war; and how they have been\r\nkept alive by designing men on both sides; when we bear these things\r\nin mind, it is easy to see that it has required no little courage for\r\na Southern man, in the midst of Southern people, with their sentiments\r\nand feelings, to take up the black man’s cause and advocate it in words\r\nof bold, plain truth.\r\n\r\nDr. Haygood is the Christian, and not the politician. When he praises,\r\nas he does without stint, the work accomplished for the Negro by the\r\npeople of the North, it is not the work of that particular politician,\r\nwith his promise of “a mule, forty acres, and provisions for a year,”\r\nbut of teachers, secular and religious, who, with a motive higher than\r\nthe personal, have sought the elevation, moral and intellectual, of\r\nthe Negro. He pleads no apology for his Southern brethren who have\r\nmet these benevolent workers with opposition, social ostracism, and\r\nother forms of persecution, but utters his condemnation of this spirit\r\nwhenever and wherever manifested.\r\n\r\nAnd the results of the first twenty years’ history have justified his\r\nhigh and hopeful views. It is only two years since Senator Brown,\r\nof Georgia, said of the Negro, in a speech delivered in the United\r\nStates Senate: “He has shown a capacity to receive education, and a\r\ndisposition to elevate himself that is exceedingly gratifying, not\r\nonly to me, but to every right-thinking Southern man.” The results\r\nshow that the Negro has a real hunger for the education he so greatly\r\nneeds. It is shown that in the year 1881, forty-seven per cent. of the\r\ncolored school population was enrolled as attending the public schools,\r\nwhilst in the same year there was enrolled fifty-two per cent. of the\r\nwhite population. Though both figures are painfully low, and suggest a\r\ncondition of great illiteracy, yet, when we remember the past of the\r\nNegro—how he has been trampled down and trodden under—the figure 47 at\r\nthe end of his first twenty years, is both encouraging and significant.\r\n\r\nBut Dr. Haygood finds his strongest hope in the religious nature of\r\nthe Negro. The religious element of the race was very manifest in the\r\ndays of slavery, and since its freedom still more so. The moral and\r\nreligious progress of twenty years is encouraging. Of seven millions,\r\nthe entire colored population, a million and a half are communicants of\r\nthe various churches. Whilst their notions are crude, their conceptions\r\nof religious truth often painfully realistic and grotesque, yet their\r\nreligion is real and worthy of confidence. More than to all other\r\ninfluences combined, to the black man’s religion is due the shaping of\r\nhis better character. It is from this basis, and working along this\r\nline, that Dr. Haygood sees the success of the future. His closing word\r\nat Chautauqua is a statement of the whole theory which will commend\r\nitself to the sympathy and judgment of right-thinking Christian men\r\neverywhere: “Mere statesmanship can not solve this hard problem. It\r\nis not given to the wisdom of man; but God reigns, and God does not\r\nfail. We are workers with him in his great designs. When we stand by\r\nthe cross of Jesus Christ we will know what to do. We can solve our\r\nproblem, God being our helper. But on no lower platform than this—the\r\nplatform of the Ten Commandments and of the Sermon on the Mount.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POLITICAL OUTLOOK.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a few months we shall be in the midst of another presidential\r\ncampaign, and one as exciting, perhaps, as the country has known.\r\nAlready we see earnest preparations for the fray. The party managers\r\nare busily laying their schemes; the question of candidates and the\r\nmeasures to secure victory are being thoroughly canvassed by the rival\r\nparties.\r\n\r\nWhat now strikes the thoughtful person as he considers the political\r\noutlook is the lack of party issues. Two great parties are seen on the\r\neve of a tremendous struggle for the reins of government; but when the\r\nquestion is asked, what are the living issues at the bottom of this\r\nfight? one is puzzled for a reply. The situation is about this: instead\r\nof coming before the people with certain great principles as a ground\r\nof contention, one party has for its cry, “Put the rascals out;” and\r\nthe other, “Let us keep the rascals from coming in.”\r\n\r\nOur feeling is that the case should be different. Are there no living\r\nissues important enough to serve as the rallying cry of political\r\nparties? Must parties live on a past record? Is there nothing for\r\nthem to do but to glory in what they have done, and point a finger of\r\ncontempt at the other side? By no means is this the case. There are\r\nto-day vitally important matters pertaining to the public welfare which\r\ncall loudly to our political leaders for attention; and the party\r\nwhich shall take hold of these matters in an earnest way, and boldly\r\npresent itself as the champion of principles of truth and justice and\r\npurity, ought to be, and must be, the party of the future.\r\n\r\nThe reform of the civil service might very well be a party issue, but\r\nit is not. Neither of the great parties shows a disposition to take a\r\nhearty and united stand in favor of such reform. Some prominent men in\r\nboth parties have it at heart, and the movement which has been seen\r\ncan not be claimed as a party movement. The reform of the tariff wise\r\nmen see to be one of the crying needs of the hour; but how hopelessly\r\nat sea seem our party leaders in dealing with the question. It can not\r\nbe said that any principles of tariff are a party issue. There is a\r\nwide diversity of sentiment among those who have the management of the\r\nparties; on either side are seen free-trade men and protective tariff\r\nmen; and probably some have their opinions yet to form upon a subject\r\nso live and important as the tariff. The nation has a yearly surplus\r\nrevenue of $100,000,000, to get rid of which extravagant and needless\r\nappropriations are made; the embarrassment of certain branches of\r\nindustry in our land, as things are, is evident; but to which party can\r\nwe point as the one intelligently and earnestly bent on tariff reform?\r\nThe time may come when the prohibition of the liquor traffic will be\r\nthe underlying principle of a great political party, but it is not now.\r\nWe may have our opinions as to which of the great parties bidding for\r\nthe suffrages of the people is the more a temperance party, but either\r\nis a great way from being ready to adopt as an issue the righteous\r\nprinciple of prohibition. In just one State to-day (Iowa), one of the\r\nparties appears as the supporter of this principle. Turn to another\r\nState (Massachusetts), which sometimes is thought to lead all the\r\nrest in moral ideas, and see the same party fighting neither for this\r\nprinciple nor any other, but simply to wrest the power from Governor\r\nButler.\r\n\r\nWe judge of the coming national campaign by that now in progress in\r\ndifferent States, and we see it is to be marked by a lack of high and\r\nworthy party issues. It will be—what it should not be—a contest without\r\ngreat underlying principles. Let whichever party may triumph, the\r\nvictory can not be regarded one of living principles; it will be rather\r\nthe success of individuals to whom the majority of the people choose\r\nto commit the reins of authority, or the triumph of a party which\r\nthe people prefer for its record, or to which they give a blind and\r\nunthinking preference. Whatever the outcome of the impending political\r\nstruggle, we have faith in the perpetuity of our institutions, and that\r\nthere is a nobler destiny for the American people than they have yet\r\nattained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF GREECE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe installment of Grecian History required in the C. L. S. C. course\r\nis not extensive, but has been prepared with much care, and is adapted\r\nto its purpose. A careful study—enough to give possession of the\r\nprincipal facts stated, can hardly fail to kindle the desire for\r\nfurther knowledge of a people who had so many elements of greatness,\r\nand for centuries surpassed all others in knowledge and culture. The\r\nmost advanced nations of to-day are largely indebted to the Greeks.\r\nModern art and literature bear witness to the indebtedness. The race\r\nhad wonderful capabilities. Their country, climate, blood, early habits\r\nof self-control, or all these together, secured in that corner of\r\nEurope a class of stalwart men, physically and intellectually capable\r\nof great deeds.\r\n\r\nMuch of their early history is, of course, fabulous. The gods,\r\ngoddesses, heroes and kings, whose councils and exploits are rehearsed,\r\nwere but myths. Yet the legendary traditions respecting them have\r\ncharms that attract and hold the reader. We may utterly discredit\r\nthe story, but pay homage to the ability and versatile genius of\r\nthe writer, whose glowing words so paint the scenes described. Only\r\na slight basis of fact is conceded to some of the most captivating\r\nHomeric descriptions; yet they are in an important sense true. False\r\nin history, but sublimely true to the conceptions of the greatest of\r\npoets, as a bold delineator, peerless in his own, or any other age. If\r\nthe ideal of the divinities thought to be interested in the affairs of\r\nmen falls far below the conceptions of a monotheist, and seems unworthy\r\nof a philanthropic heathen, the portraiture is both complete and\r\ncaptivating.\r\n\r\nWhen the mists, that for centuries shrouded Greece and the neighboring\r\nisles, are dispersed, and we recognize the certain dawn of the\r\n_historic_ period, though the descendants of those mighty heroes and\r\nkings that were deified as sons of the gods, shrink to the proportions\r\nof men, they are still found to be mighty men, whose noble deeds and\r\nachievements have been an inspiration to millions in the generations\r\nsince. Excepting only such as have the true light, and are blest with\r\nChristian civilization, we adopt the statement “No other race ever did\r\nso many things well as the Greeks.”\r\n\r\nLet the book be closely studied. If the cursory, objectless reader\r\nlacks interest, and tires in the work, the student feels more than\r\ncompensated for his toil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA COLLEGE REFORM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe present agitation touching college courses of study is one from\r\nwhich good is likely to come. There is danger, however, that we swing\r\nto the other extreme. That undue prominence in the ordinary college\r\ncurriculum has hitherto been given to classical studies, and too little\r\nroom made for the modern languages, natural science, and English\r\nliterature is coming to be widely felt. But the true reform is not\r\nutterly to eliminate the classics; it is not the part of wisdom to\r\ndecry as folly the study of the dead tongues.\r\n\r\nThe oration of Charles Francis Adams, Jr., last summer at Harvard,\r\npublished under the title of “A College Fetich,” was quite as\r\nunexpected and sensational as that of Wendell Phillips on another\r\nsimilar occasion. Mr. Phillips arraigned his _alma mater_ that her sons\r\nwere no more active in social reforms, while Mr. Adams charged upon her\r\nthat, in retaining the dead languages as a required part of the course\r\nof study, she was guilty of worshiping a fetich. This grandson and\r\ngreat-grandson of a President, whose illustrious ancestors one after\r\nanother were inmates of Harvard’s halls, makes against the venerable\r\ninstitution, the most serious charge that her graduates, upon leaving\r\nher, are not fitted as they should be for practical life. She sends\r\nthem forth, he affirms, with a smattering of the dead languages, which\r\nis quite without advantage, instead of with a thorough knowledge of\r\nwhat can be turned to practical account and will qualify them for the\r\nduties of active life. He would have a drill in the classics no longer\r\nrequired of the college student; but would allow him to win his A. B.\r\nby pursuing other and more useful branches of study. Mr. Adams’s bold\r\nclaim against Harvard, if sustained, would of course hold against other\r\ncolleges, and against some others would hold in a higher degree.\r\n\r\nBut we think his statements are too sweeping, and the reform he\r\nadvocates, because it goes too far, would not be a wise reform. We\r\nwould not abolish the study of Latin and Greek in our colleges. They\r\nare dead tongues, but it does not follow that time spent in their\r\nstudy is wasted. On the contrary, we would have them taught with such\r\nthoroughness, by such qualified and skillful teachers that the college\r\ngraduate will go out with something more than a smattering of them. It\r\nis a fact which can not be disproved, that from a study of the classics\r\ncomes a mental discipline and a mastery of good English, such as can\r\nbe acquired from nothing else. But that too much comparative attention\r\nhas been given to these branches is freely conceded. There is a want\r\nof more thorough study in our higher institutions of the natural\r\nscience, the modern tongues, and the models of our own language. The\r\ntrue reform is to cease to magnify Latin and Greek at the expense of\r\nthese other things, and to give to the latter their due attention. Of\r\nthe wisdom of elective college courses there can be no doubt. It may\r\nnot be always best for the young man who has not in view one of the\r\nlearned professions, but a business life, to spend years in the study\r\nof the ancient languages. But it is our judgment that a knowledge of\r\nthese should always be required of the candidate for the Bachelor of\r\nArt’s degree. Certain things are in the air, and we rejoice. Natural\r\nscience, that field of study in richness so exhaustless, is attracting\r\nthe student as never before. The importance of gaining a knowledge of\r\nlanguages now spoken, other than our own, is being felt as it was not\r\nonce. We welcome the indications that promise a college reform. Let us\r\nhave it without over-shooting the mark.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDITOR’S NOTE-BOOK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trustees of the Garfield monument to be erected in Cleveland, Ohio,\r\nhave more than one hundred and thirty thousand dollars on hand, and\r\nthey expect to secure a sufficient increase to this sum, at an early\r\nday, to complete the work. This, with the fund of more than three\r\nhundred thousand dollars which the American people contributed and\r\npresented to the widow of the lamented Garfield, is positive proof that\r\nour republic is not ungrateful.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe old statement that a low grade of moral character may exist in\r\nthe same community with a high grade of mental culture may be true of\r\nany type of the best modern civilizations, but it is not necessarily\r\ntrue. Education, like the gospel, may be the savor of death unto death,\r\nbut moral death need not be its effect. A good illustration of the\r\nelevating tendencies of education in the community is found in the fact\r\nthat since the compulsory school law went into operation in New York,\r\njuvenile crime in that city has been reduced by more than thirty-six\r\nper cent. And yet it is said the law has been only partially enforced.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nScientific temperance education has been by legislative action\r\nintroduced into the public schools of Vermont and Michigan, and at the\r\nlast session of the legislature in New Hampshire it was by a unanimous\r\nvote introduced into the schools of that State. The W. C. T. U. is\r\nlaying its hand on legislatures in a very effective way, and we may\r\nlook for an abundant harvest in the next generation. “Long voyages make\r\nrich returns.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPrince Bismarck is a timber merchant, and why should not a dealer\r\nin timber be called a merchant? But this is not all. He is a large\r\ndistiller of spirituous liquors. The Germans do not object to his\r\noccupation as a distiller, for their drinking customs are on a low\r\ngrade. Public opinion, in this country, would not long tolerate a\r\nstatesman, even of great abilities, who manufactured distilled liquors\r\nfor sale as a beverage. And herein we see one point of difference\r\nbetween these two nations on a great moral reform.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Scientific American_ of a recent date says: “Too much reliance\r\nis placed on the sense of taste, sight and smell in determining the\r\ncharacter of drinking water. It is a fact which has been repeatedly\r\nillustrated that water may be odorless, tasteless and colorless, and\r\nyet be full of danger to those who use it. The recent outbreak of\r\ntyphoid fever in Newburg, N. Y., is an example, having been caused by\r\nwater which was clear, and without taste or smell. It is also a fact\r\nthat even a chemical analysis sometimes will fail to show a dangerous\r\ncontamination of the water, and will always fail to detect the specific\r\npoison if the water is infected with discharges of an infectious\r\nnature. It is therefore urged that the source of the water supply\r\nshould be kept free from all possible means of contamination by sewage.\r\nIt is only in the knowledge of perfect cleanliness that safety is\r\nguaranteed.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Henry Hart, of Brockport, N. Y., manufactures a C. L. S. C. gold\r\npin of beautiful design for gentlemen, and another one attached to\r\nan arrow, which is equally handsome, for ladies. Either one makes an\r\nappropriate badge for members of the Circle to wear in everyday life,\r\nand at times it will serve to introduce strangers when traveling or in\r\nstrange places, who have a common sympathy in a great work, and thus\r\naid the possessor in extending his circle of acquaintances.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne of the most embarrassing questions in the management of colleges\r\nand universities is, how shall trustees superannuate a certain class of\r\nprofessors, whose days of usefulness in the recitation room are past.\r\nWhen that problem is solved the unity and peace of the management will,\r\nas a rule, be secured.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe New York _Herald_ is led to pronounce against capital punishment\r\nbecause in many cases the law against murder is a dead letter, and\r\nproduces the following historical reference to confirm the statement:\r\n“It appears that from 1860 to 1882 a hundred and seventy persons were\r\ntried in Massachusetts for murder in the first degree. Of this number\r\nonly twenty-nine were convicted, and only sixteen paid the extreme\r\npenalty of the law. Of those convicted one committed suicide, and\r\ntwelve got their sentences commuted. Here, then, during a period of\r\nlittle more than twenty years were a hundred and seventy murders in one\r\nState, and only sixteen executions.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey have one hundred and fifty miles of electric railway in operation\r\nin Europe. Active preparations are making by rival inventors and\r\ncorporations in New York City to introduce electricity on a large scale\r\nas a safe, rapid, and cheap motor. As in lighting houses, towns, and\r\ncities we have passed from the tallow candle to kerosene, and then to\r\ngas, and on to the electric light, so by many steps and advances we\r\nare almost ready to accept electricity as the moving power of railway\r\ntrains.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe pardoning power of the general government is liable to work\r\npernicious results in the regular army. Cases of embezzlement and\r\nfraud among army officers have been growing in number since our civil\r\nwar, and laxity in the enforcement of the laws against these offenders\r\nis a growing evil. General J. B. Fry, an officer of repute, and a\r\ngraduate of West Point, thus points out the evil: “The interposition\r\nof higher authority in favor of offenders has been so frequent since\r\nthe war, especially from 1876 to 1880, as to be a great injury to\r\nthe service. Many of the evils which have been exposed recently are\r\nfairly chargeable to executive and legislative reversal of army action.\r\n* * * When the strong current of military justice is dammed by the\r\nauthorities set over the army, stagnant pools are formed which breed\r\nscandal, fraud, disobedience, dissipation, and disgrace, sometimes even\r\namong those educated for the service.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCable intelligence, received September 3, shows that the Baron\r\nNordenskjöld, as a Greenland explorer, has accomplished a large part of\r\nhis original purpose. The expedition entered West Greenland in latitude\r\n68°, and proceeded 220 miles inland, attained an altitude of seven\r\nthousand feet above the sea level. In 1878 Lieutenant Jansen, of the\r\nDanish navy, penetrated fifty miles from the coast, and reached an “icy\r\nmountain, in lat. 62° 40′, five thousand feet high.” But no explorer\r\nhas since done anything worth mention toward solving the mystery of\r\nGreenland’s interior physical geography. The expedition with Professor\r\nNordenskjöld has gone farther and seen more of the “immense desert of\r\nice;” and the latest telegrams claim that some important scientific\r\ndata have been obtained.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe prohibition amendment, submitted to the voters of Ohio, is\r\ndefeated, and our cherished hopes of its success, for the present,\r\nsadly disappointed. The non-partisan temperance people, everywhere,\r\nfelt deeply interested in the issue, and will hear the result with\r\nprofound sorrow. Multitudes of Ohio’s best men and women, who had\r\nprayed, worked, and hoped that deliverance might come in that way,\r\nand that from the 9th of October we would see the unspeakable curse\r\nof the liquor traffic placed where it ought to be, under the ban of\r\nthe constitution, from which corrupt tinkering politicians would be\r\nunable to protect it, will confess their disappointment, but neither\r\nsuppress their prayers nor cease their efforts. They are clearly in the\r\nmajority, and when united will succeed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTelegraphic report says the Vicar of Stratford has authorized the\r\nexhumation of the remains of Shakspere that they may compare the skull\r\nwith the bust that stands over the grave. Dr. Ingleby, of London, who\r\nis a trustee of the Shakspere Museum at Stratford, wishes, it seems,\r\nto photograph the face and take a cast of the skull. The absurdity of\r\nthe proposal makes it almost incredible, and should itself prevent the\r\ndesecration. We are not surprised that the bishop and local authorities\r\nhave protested, and the intended outrage will hardly be perpetrated.\r\nBy the terms of the deed of interment the consent of the Mayor of\r\nStratford-on-Avon must first be given before the body can be moved. To\r\nthis proposal, that official has given a decided refusal, and the dust\r\nof the poet will not be disturbed. Shakspere has been dead two hundred\r\nand sixty-seven years. The type of face and head, universally accepted\r\nas his, is sufficiently accurate. If it were not the correction of any\r\nfault in that likeness is now impossible.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Pittsburgh Exposition building, with most of its contents, was\r\nentirely consumed by fire during the exposition week. The principal\r\nloss was the goods on exhibition, including many articles of exquisite\r\nworkmanship, and valuable relics that can not be replaced. The building\r\nitself, though a wooden structure, was large, and seemed suitable for\r\nthe purpose. It was valued at $150,000 and not heavily insured. Perhaps\r\nsufficient care was not taken to secure the property against the\r\ncalamity that, in so short a time, destroyed the whole. The company,\r\nwho had before suffered some reverses and losses, and were struggling\r\ninto what seemed a safe condition, with hopes of future prosperity,\r\nhave the sympathy of the public.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring the last decade, and especially since the great Centennial,\r\nexpositions have been numerous, and, in many cases, attended with most\r\ngratifying results. When the associations providing them are controlled\r\nby men of culture, they are generously sustained. The articles they\r\nhave to exhibit are not only numerous, but in kind and quality,\r\nworthy of our advanced civilization. These American expositions are\r\nbecoming notably rich in manufactured articles, and in the extent and\r\nvariety of useful machinery. For inventive genius the Yankee nation is\r\nunrivaled, while in the mechanical execution of the designs our skilled\r\nartisans have few, if any, superiors. In the principal western cities\r\nthe holding of at least annual expositions is no longer a tentative\r\nmeasure. The institutions are established, and their continuance, in\r\nmost cases, pretty well assured. An example of these is the “Detroit\r\nArt and Loan Exposition” of recent origin. Already it has fair\r\nproportions, being from the commencement, in most respects, equal\r\nto the best. Evidently the project for having there a creditable,\r\nfirst-class exposition was clearly conceived, generously sustained, and\r\nmost successfully executed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBefore Congress opens General W.

It is wholesome truth: “Marriage is a divine institution,\r\nand the Catholic Church under no circumstances whatever permits the\r\nsacred contract to be broken.” To the question, “Is there no such thing\r\nas separation between husband and wife recognized in the Catholic\r\nChurch?” he answered: “Separation, yes, for the gravest reasons and\r\nunder restrictions that do not admit of the remarriage of either of the\r\nparties to the original contract while both are living. But divorce in\r\nthe sense generally accepted, never. Rather than permit divorce, the\r\nChurch let England separate from the Holy See. The same question was\r\nraised by the first Napoleon, and it was ruled against him by the Pope.\r\nYou will find that if anything bearing the appearance of divorce has\r\nbeen allowed in the Catholic Church, it has always been a case where\r\nthe most careful investigation showed that the marriage was originally\r\ninvalid.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Germans on October 8 in many towns and cities celebrated the\r\nbi-centennial of the arrival of the first German immigrants in this\r\ncountry, on the ship “Concord.” Their singing, secret, and literary\r\nsocieties paraded in regalia, with banners and music.

Judge Noah Davis\r\npresided and delivered the address of welcome. “In speaking of Mr.\r\nMurphy’s work in England and Scotland he quoted the statistics of the\r\nUnited Kingdom to prove that Mr. Murphy’s efforts had been effectual in\r\nreducing the excise revenues many thousands of pounds sterling. He said\r\nthat during his two years’ stay in England and Scotland he had obtained\r\nhalf a million signers to the pledge. Mr. Murphy responded in a few\r\nbrief words, declaring that the occasion was the happiest of his whole\r\nlife. A number of short addresses were made by clergymen, and with the\r\nsinging of songs and choruses, in which the whole assembly engaged, the\r\nceremonies were prolonged until about half-past ten o’clock.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe C. L. S. C. is rapidly becoming an established institution among\r\nNew England people. This is to be accounted for in part by the fact\r\nthat the religious press of Boston and other New England cities has\r\nfavored the work with earnest, strong words. The Rev. Dr. B. K. Pierce,\r\neditor of _Zion’s Herald_, closes a leading editorial on the C. L. S.\r\nC., in his paper of a recent date, with these words: “There is another\r\nreason why we look with great satisfaction upon this widely-extended\r\nhome-university. We have fallen upon an era of doubt. The literature\r\nof the hour is full of sneers at revealed religion and of arrogant\r\nand destructive criticism upon the Holy Scriptures. The daily, weekly\r\nand monthly press is strongly flavored with this. Our young people\r\nbreathe it in the atmosphere of the school and of the streets. Here\r\nis one of the best, silent, powerful, positive correctives. This\r\ncarefully-arranged plan of study and reading for successive years is\r\nentirely in the interest of the ‘truth as it is in Jesus.’ It is not\r\nnarrow, nor dogmatic, nor polemical, nor confined to purely religious\r\nsubjects, but the whole system is arranged and followed out upon\r\nthe presumption of the inspiration of the Bible, the divine origin\r\nof Christianity, and its ultimate triumph upon the earth. It will\r\npowerfully strengthen the faith of young Christians, preserve them from\r\nthe insidious attacks of infidelity, and enable them to have, and to\r\ngive to any serious inquirer, an answer for the hope that is in them.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe jury system has some glaring defects which should be laid bare\r\nand made the subject of agitation till they are corrected. Recently\r\nin a famous bribery case (so called) at Albany, N. Y., when jurors\r\nwere being called and questioned, one of them said, “I don’t know who\r\nwere the United States Senators two years ago from New York.” Yet\r\nthis ignorant man was accepted as a juror. This is a common custom in\r\nthe selection of jurors. It is exalting ignorance at the expense of\r\nintelligence and justice. Some remedy should be found for this growing\r\nand terrible evil.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA new field of artistic ability is being developed in the East. It is\r\nthe decoration of the interior of private residences. Already in New\r\nYork a number of young artists, who find it difficult to sell all the\r\npictures they paint, are giving their attention to this work, which\r\npromises to be very remunerative and very extensive.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Chicago agency of Alice H.

In the formerly\r\nslaveholding States there are 4,154,125 men legally entitled to vote.\r\nOf these, 409,563 whites, and 982,894 colored, are unable to write\r\neven their names, and their ability to read is very limited. Many, who\r\nprofess to be able to read, can only with difficulty spell out a few\r\nsimple sentences in their primers, and really get no knowledge, such as\r\nthe citizen needs, from either books or papers. Thousands of them have\r\nneither books nor papers, and could not read them if they had. Surely a\r\ngreat work must be done for these freed men and poor whites before they\r\nare quite equal to all the duties of citizens in a country like ours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDITOR’S TABLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. Dec´orus or deco´rus, which?\r\n\r\nA. Webster authorizes both, giving preference to the latter. The\r\nformer has the advantage of placing the accent on the root syllable, a\r\nrule that is very helpful in settling questions of pronunciation, and\r\nconforms to usage in the accentuation of cognate words, as “dec´orate,”\r\n“dec´oration,” etc. We prefer it.\r\n\r\nQ. What is the meaning of “liberal,” in the phrases, “liberal\r\neducation,” and “liberal religious views?”\r\n\r\nA. An education extended much beyond the practical necessities of our\r\nevery-day business and social life, is liberal. It is not a possession\r\nbelonging alone to the alumni of colleges and universities. Any person\r\nof culture, who, with or without the aid of teachers, has mastered\r\nthe curriculum of studies prescribed by colleges, or its equivalent,\r\nis liberally educated. In the best sense, a man of “liberal religious\r\nviews” is generous, freely according to others the right to their\r\nopinions on all subjects about which good men may differ. He is not\r\ncreedless, but not bigoted; and cordially approves “things that\r\nare most excellent,” wherever they are found. The claim to great\r\nliberality, set up by those who have no rule of faith, and no views\r\nthey are willing to formulate, does not seem well founded.\r\n\r\nQ. Where is the line, “Far from the madding crowd’s ignoble strife”\r\nfound? and should not the word “madding” be “maddening?”\r\n\r\nA. The line is from Gray’s Elegy (73). The adjective “mad” is made a\r\ncausative verb, without the usual suffix, “en.” We do not find the form\r\nin prose, and would not use it.\r\n\r\nQ. Are there any books purporting to prove scientifically the\r\nimmortality of the soul?\r\n\r\nA. If by “scientifically,” the querist means, as we suppose,\r\nrationally, philosophically, our answer is, yes, very many. More\r\nbooks have been written upon this one subject than one could read\r\ncarefully in a lifetime. Several thousand distinct works, written in\r\nGreek, Latin, English, and the principal languages of Europe, have\r\nbeen catalogued by Ezra Abbott. The catalogue itself, published as\r\nan appendix to Alger’s “Doctrine of a Future Life,” would make a\r\nrespectable volume, containing, as it does, a list of more than five\r\nthousand books, by almost as many authors, who discuss, more or less\r\nsatisfactorily, the great problem of the soul. Some propose, not\r\nargument, but only a history of the doctrine of a future, immortal\r\nlife as held by the different races of men, with various shades\r\nof opinion respecting it. Some doubt, some disbelieve, and some,\r\ndiscarding all rational processes, accept the dogma as a matter of\r\nfaith alone, lying beyond the field of our reason. But many Christian\r\nwriters, thankful for the “more sure word of prophecy,” and that\r\n“life and immortality are brought to light by the gospel,” hold also\r\nthat outside the realm of faith, it is a fit subject for rational\r\ninvestigation, and as capable of proof or demonstration as other\r\nmoral and psychical problems. Perhaps most of the works named in\r\nthe catalogue consulted, treat of the soul and its immortality in\r\nconnection with other principles and facts of the religious systems\r\naccepted by the authors, and are too voluminous for common use. Drew’s\r\n“Essay on the Immateriality and Immortality of the Soul” founded wholly\r\non psychological and rational principles is regarded a masterpiece of\r\nmetaphysical argument—clear, logical, satisfactory.\r\n\r\nQ. Is the expression “as though” ever correct?\r\n\r\nA. “Though” is often used in English, taking the place of the\r\nconditional _if_, especially in the phrases _as though_ and _what\r\nthough_, which interchange with _as if_ and _what if_; _e. g._:\r\n\r\n    “If she bid me pack, I’ll give her thanks _as though_\r\n    she bid me stay by her a week.”—_Shakspere._\r\n\r\n    “A Tartar, who looked _as though_ the speed of thought\r\n    were in his limbs.”—_Byron._\r\n\r\nOther examples need not be given. These approve the expression as\r\ncorrect, though not much used at present.\r\n\r\nQ. Will the firing of cannon over water bring a dead body at the bottom\r\nto the surface; if so, why, or how?\r\n\r\nA. The concussion or violent agitation of the water may loosen a body\r\nslightly held at the bottom, when, if specifically lighter than water,\r\nit will rise.\r\n\r\nQ. In “Recreations in Astronomy,” p. 163, it is said 192 asteroides\r\nhave been discovered, with diameters from 20 to 400 miles; and on the\r\nnext page it is “estimated” that if all these were put into one planet,\r\nit would not be over 400 miles in diameter. How can that be?\r\n\r\nA. Allowing, as the author does, that the density of the masses remains\r\nthe same, it would, of course, be impossible. We have not the means\r\nat hand to either verify or correct the diameters given, and can not\r\nlocate the error.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nC. L. S. C.

But for ordinary reference\r\nthese volumes were of little value, so that the “Institutes” were\r\nwritten, similar in contents, but condensed. A new code was afterward\r\npromulgated; also several new _constitutiones_—together these books\r\nform the Roman law.\r\n\r\n“Tribonian,” tri-bo´ni-an; “Side,” si´de.\r\n\r\nP. 333.—“Kalydonian Kapros.” The Calydonian wild boar.\r\n\r\n“Bronze-eagle.” In every race-course of the ancient Greeks a bronze\r\neagle and a dolphin were used for signals in starting.

He played a distinguished part in the\r\npolitical, religious and literary affairs of the ninth century. After\r\nholding various offices, he was made patriarch by Bardas, deposing\r\nIgnatius. This incensed the Romish Church, and the controversy which\r\narose did much to widen the gulf between the Eastern and Western\r\nChurches. Photius was deposed from his position, but replaced until the\r\ndeath of Basil, when he was driven into exile. Among his writings the\r\nmost valuable is a review of ancient Greek literature. Many books are\r\ndescribed in it of which we have no other knowledge.\r\n\r\nP. 372.—“Arsacidæ,” ar-sac´i-dæ. So called from Arsaces, the founder\r\nof the Parthian empire. About 250 B. C.

For this\r\nreason no notes have been made out on the work. By consulting the notes\r\non Timayenis’s history in THE CHAUTAUQUAN for October, all necessary\r\nhelp will be obtained. The papers on Physical Science and Political\r\nEconomy, also the Sunday Readings, are too clear to need annotating.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES ON REQUIRED READINGS IN “THE CHAUTAUQUAN.”\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMAN HISTORY.\r\n\r\nP. 63, c. 1.—“Hermann.” The Latinized form of whose name was Arminius.\r\nHe had learned the language and the military discipline of the Romans\r\nwhen he led his tribe as auxiliaries to their legions.\r\n\r\n“Varus,” va´rus.

Many of the\r\nevents were contemporaneous, so that the descriptions and incidents are\r\nparticularly valuable.\r\n\r\nP. 64, c. 2.—“Vandals.” This tribe first appeared in the north of\r\nGermany, from whence they went to the Reisengebirge, sometimes called\r\nfrom them the Vandal Mountains. In the fifth century they worked their\r\nway from Pannonia into Spain, marched southward and founded the once\r\npowerful kingdom of Andalusia (Vandalusia). In 429 they conquered\r\nAfrica. An hundred years afterward Belisarius overthrew their power,\r\nand the race disappeared.

He defeated him in several battles and finally laid\r\nsiege to Ravenna, where Odoacer had taken refuge. After holding out\r\nthree years, Odoacer submitted on condition that he rule jointly with\r\nTheodoric, but the latter soon murdered his rival. For thirty-three\r\nyears Theodoric ruled the country.

There is\r\nthen a pause of thirteen years, after which Kriemhild, the better to\r\neffect her fatal purpose, marries Attila. Thirteen years having again\r\npassed away her thirst for vengeance is satiated by slaying the entire\r\nBurgundian court. The Germans justly regard this epic as one of the\r\nmost precious gems of their literature.”—_Sime._\r\n\r\n“Ulfilas,” ŭl´fĭ-las. (310-381.) The family of Ulfilas were Christians\r\nsupposed to have been carried away by the Goths. In 341 he became the\r\nbishop of these people and soon induced a number of them to leave their\r\nwarlike life to settle a colony in Mœsia. Here he cultivated the arts\r\nof peace, doing much to civilize the people. He introduced an alphabet\r\nof twenty-four letters and translated all of the Bible except the book\r\nof Kings. This work is the earliest known specimen of the Teutonic\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\n“Wolfram von Eschenbach,” fon esh´en-bäk. He lived at the close of the\r\ntwelfth century. A nobleman by birth and a soldier in the civil wars.\r\nHe joined the court of Hermann of Thuringia in the castle of Wartburg\r\n(where Luther escaped after the Diet of Worms) and was a contestant in\r\nthe famous musical contest called “The war of the Wartburg.” Leaving\r\nhere he afterward sang at many other courts, dying in 1225.\r\n\r\n“Parzival” or Parcival, par´ci-val.\r\n\r\n“Holy Grail.” The chalice said to have been used by Christ at the\r\nLast Supper and in which the wine was changed to blood. As the legend\r\nruns it fell into the hands of Joseph of Arimathea, by whom it was\r\nheld for centuries, but finally, at his death, it passed to his\r\ndescendants, with whom it remained until its possessor sinned; then the\r\ncup disappeared. The Knights of the Round-Table sought it, but until\r\nSir Galahad no man was found so pure in heart and life that he could\r\nlook upon it. Sir Galahad in some romances is called Sir Percival or\r\n_Parzival_. Eisenbach wrote another romance, “Titural,” founded on the\r\nsame legend.\r\n\r\n“Gottfried,” gott´freed; “Tristram and Iseult,” trĭs´tram, is´eult;\r\n“Gudrun,” gu´drun.\r\n\r\n“Walther von der Vogelweide,” wäl´ter fon der fō=´=gel-wī´deh.\r\n(1165?-1228?)

His love for the poor led him to\r\nzealous work in their behalf. Through many years he preached in the\r\nopen air in Germany, Switzerland and Hungary.\r\n\r\n“Eckhart,” ĕk´hart. The father of German speculative thought, as Bach\r\ncalls him, was a Dominician monk who attempted to reform his order but\r\npreached so exalted a philosophy that the Pope demanded a recantation.\r\nEckhart never gave this but claimed that his views were entirely\r\northodox. His prose is among the purest specimens in the German\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\n“Meistersänger.” Master-singer.\r\n\r\nP. 66, c. 2.—“Shrove-Tuesday,” or confession Tuesday is the day before\r\nLent. Although originally a day of preparation for the Lenten fast, it\r\nwas soon changed to one of merry-making and feasting.

As an advocate\r\nof the new learning, he went from city to city teaching and writing;\r\n“Epistolæ Obscurorum Virorum” was written in defense of this theory. He\r\nespoused the cause of the Reformation more because it favored religious\r\nand secular progress than from sympathy with its principles.\r\n\r\n“Hans Sachs.” (1494-1576.) “Honest Hans Sachs,” as he was called,\r\nwas a cobbler of Nuremberg, who had learned verse-making from a\r\n_meistersänger_ of Munich. His verses included every style of poetry\r\nknown, but the “Shrove-Tuesday plays” were the best, being full of\r\nstrong characters and striking situations. The hymn mentioned, “Why art\r\nthou cast down, O, my soul?” is but one of several by him.\r\n\r\n“Leibnitz,” līp´nits. (1646-1716.) Educated at Leipsic, he says of\r\nhimself, that before he was twelve, he “understood the Latin authors,\r\nhad begun to lisp Greek and wrote verses with singular success.” After\r\ntaking his degree he went to Frankfort under the patronage of a wealthy\r\ngentleman; here he devoted himself to composing treatises on religion,\r\nphilosophy, law, etc. All manner of projects interested him. He tried\r\nto bring about a union between the Catholic and Lutheran Churches, to\r\nintroduce a common alphabet for all languages, to urge the king of\r\nFrance to conquer Egypt, and other plans, more or less Utopian. In the\r\nlatter part of his life he received high honor from Hanover, Vienna,\r\nand Peter the Great.

Having been made an\r\nAmerican citizen he was appointed consul to Cyprus, where he discovered\r\nthe necropolis of Idalium, a city which ceased to exist two thousand\r\nyears ago. He began excavations, opening some eight thousand tombs,\r\nbut an edict from the sultan stopped the work. Cesnola had already,\r\nhowever, gathered a magnificent collection of antiquities, which, in\r\n1872 was purchased for the Metropolitan Museum of New York.\r\n\r\n“Harpy.” The reliefs on this monument represent harpies, fabulous\r\nmonsters in Greek mythology, carrying off children.\r\n\r\n“Frieze,” freez. The broad band resting upon the columns of a porch is\r\ncalled the entablature. It is divided into three portions; the central\r\none is the frieze.\r\n\r\nP. 75, c. 2.—“Ageladas,” ag´e-la=´=das. _Not Argeladas._\r\n\r\n“Myron.” A Bœotian, born about 480 B. C. His master-pieces were all\r\nin bronze. The “quoit-player” and the “cow” are most famous. Myron\r\nexcelled in animals and figures in action.\r\n\r\n“Canachus,” can´a-chus. (B. C. 540-508.) He executed the colossal\r\nstatue of Apollo at Miletus, was skilled in casting bronze, in gold and\r\nsilver, and in wood carving.\r\n\r\n“Callon,” cal´lon. (B. C. 516.)\r\n\r\n“Onatus,” o-na´tus. (B. C. 460.) “Hegias,” he´gi-as; “Critius,”\r\ncri´ti-us.\r\n\r\n“Calamis,” cal´a-mis. (B. C. 467-429.) He worked in marble, gold and\r\nivory. His horses are said to have been unsurpassable, and his heroic\r\nfemale figures superior to those of his predecessors.\r\n\r\n“Pythagoras.” Lived about 470 in Magna Græcia. He executed life-like\r\nfigures in bronze.\r\n\r\n“Lemnians,” lem´ni-ans.\r\n\r\n“Paris.” At a certain wedding feast to which all the gods had been\r\ninvited except the goddess of Strife, she, angry at the slight, threw\r\nan apple into their midst with the inscription “to the fairest.” Juno,\r\nMinerva and Venus claimed it, and Jupiter ordered that Paris, then a\r\nshepherd on Mount Ida, should decide the dispute. As Venus promised him\r\nthe most beautiful of women for his wife, he gave her the apple.\r\n\r\nP. 76, c. 1.—“Pellene,” pel-le´ne. A city of Achaia.\r\n\r\n“Rochette,” ro´shĕt=´=. (1790-1854.) A French archæologist.\r\n\r\n“Alcamenes,” al-cam´e-nes. (B.C. 444-400.) His greatest work was a\r\nstatue of Venus.\r\n\r\n“Agoracritus,” ag´o-rac=´=ri-tus. (B. C. 440-428.) His most famous work\r\nwas also a Venus, which he changed into a statue of Nemesis and sold\r\nbecause the people of Athens preferred the statue of Alcamenes.\r\n\r\n“Pæonius,” pæ-o´ni-us.\r\n\r\n“Pediment.” The triangular facing or top over a portico, window, gate,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n“Metope,” met´o-pe. In the Doric style of architecture, the frieze was\r\ndivided at intervals by ornaments called triglyphs. The spaces between\r\nthese ornaments were called metopes.\r\n\r\n“Cella.” The interior space of a temple.\r\n\r\n“Phigalia,” phi-ga´li-a.\r\n\r\n“Niké-Apteros.” The wingless goddess of victory. Wingless, to signify\r\nthat the prayer of the Athenians was that victory might never leave\r\ntheir city.\r\n\r\n“Scopas,” sco´pas. (395-350.) An architect and statuary, as well as\r\nsculptor. He was the architect of the temple of Minerva at Tegea, and\r\nassisted in the bas-reliefs of the mausoleum at Halicarnassus. The\r\nfamous group of Niobe and her children is supposed to have been the\r\nwork of Scopas.\r\n\r\n“Praxiteles,” prax-it´e-les. Born at Athens B. C. 392. He worked\r\nin both marble and bronze. About fifty different works by him are\r\nmentioned. First in fame stands the Cnidian Venus, “one of the most\r\nfamous art creations of antiquity.” Apollo as the lizard-killer, his\r\nfaun and a representation of Eros are probably best-known.\r\n\r\n“Nereid,” nē´re-id. A sea nymph.\r\n\r\n“Mænad,” mæ´nad. A priestess or votary of Bacchus.\r\n\r\nP. 76, c. 2.—“Toro Farnese” or Farnese Bull. Was discovered in the\r\nsixteenth century and is now in the Naples museum. It represents the\r\nsons of Antiope tying Dirce to a bull by which she is to be dragged to\r\ndeath. The work when discovered went to the Farnese palace in Rome,\r\nhence the name of Farnese bull.\r\n\r\n“Laocoon,” la-oc´o-on. One of the chief groups in the Vatican\r\ncollection; discovered at Rome in 1506. Laocoon was a priest of Apollo,\r\nwho having blasphemed the god was destroyed at the altar with his two\r\nsons by a serpent sent by the deity.\r\n\r\n“Niobe,” ni´o-be. The group of Niobe and her children was probably\r\nfirst an ornament of the pediment of a temple. The subject is the\r\nvengeance of Apollo and Artemis upon the Theban queen Niobe, who had\r\nboasted because of her fourteen children, that she was superior to Leda\r\nwho had but two. As a punishment all her children were destroyed.\r\n\r\n“Pyromachus,” py-rom´a-chus.\r\n\r\n“Æsculapius,” æs-cu-la´pi-us. The god of the medical art.\r\n\r\n“Apollo Belvedere,” bel-vā-dā´rā, or bĕl=´=ve-deer´. This statue by\r\nmany is considered the greatest existing work of ancient art. The\r\nsubject is the god Apollo at the moment of his victory over the Python.\r\nIt was discovered in 1503, and takes its name from its position in the\r\nbelvedere of the Vatican, a gallery or open corridor of the Vatican\r\nwhich is called _belvedere_, (beautiful view) from the fine views it\r\ncommands. It is of heroic size, and is considered the very type of\r\nmanly beauty.\r\n\r\nP. 77, c. 1.—“Torus,” to´rus. A large moulding used in the base of\r\ncolumns.\r\n\r\n“Mæcenas,” mæ-ce´nas. (B. C. 73?-8.) A Roman statesman. His fame rests\r\non his patronage of literature. He was a patron of both Horace and\r\nVirgil.\r\n\r\n“Tivoli,” tiv´o-le.\r\n\r\n“Varro.” (B. C. 116-28.) “The most learned of the Romans and the most\r\nvoluminous of Roman writers.” He composed no less than 490 books; but\r\ntwo of these have come down to us.\r\n\r\n“Arcesilaus,” ar-ces=´=i-la´us.\r\n\r\n“Genetrix.” A mother.\r\n\r\n“Septimius Severus,” sep-tim´i-us se-ve´rus. (A. D. 146-211.) Roman\r\nEmperor.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN LITERATURE.\r\n\r\nP. 77, c. 2.—“Sydney Smith.” (1771-1845.) Educated at Oxford, he took\r\norders and became a curate in 1794. Afterward he taught, and in 1802\r\nassisted in establishing the _Edinburgh Review_, of which he was the\r\nfirst editor. Although he had charge, during his life, of various\r\nparishes, he was active in literary work; for twenty-five years he\r\ncontributed to the _Edinburgh Review_; he published “Sketches of Moral\r\nPhilosophy,” several volumes of sermons, papers on “American Debt,” and\r\nmany miscellaneous articles, all characterized by humor and sound sense.\r\n\r\n“Kaimes,” or Kames, kāmz. (1696-1782.) A Scottish jurist, educated at\r\nEdinburgh, and for thirty years practiced law; was then made Lord Chief\r\nJustice. He wrote many works on law, metaphysics, criticism, etc.\r\n\r\n“Davy.” (1778-1829.) The English chemist. His attention was first\r\ndirected to chemistry by his medical studies, and he made such progress\r\nin original investigation that at twenty-three he was made lecturer on\r\nchemistry in the Royal Society of London. In 1817 he became a member\r\nof the French Institute, and his reputation as a chemist was second to\r\nthat of no one in Europe. He wrote much and among his discoveries were\r\nthe bases potassium, sodium, and iodine as a simple substance. His most\r\nvaluable invention was the miner’s safety lamp.\r\n\r\n“Jeffrey.” (1773-1850.) Educated for the law, but was deeply interested\r\nin literature. After being admitted to the bar this division of\r\ninterest for a long time hindered his success. He was one of the\r\noriginal founders of the _Edinburgh Review_, and became its editor\r\nwith the fourth number. He soon made the magazine an organ of liberal\r\nthought on every theme. His most valuable contributions were his\r\nliterary criticisms. His work at the bar improved with his literary\r\nability, and in 1834 he was made a judge, a position he held until his\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n“Passy,” päs=´=se´.\r\n\r\nP. 78, c. 1.—“Bancroft,” băng´kroft. (1800.) See American Literature.\r\n\r\n“Rufus King.” (1755-1827.) American statesman.\r\n\r\n“Everett.” (1794-1865.) American orator and statesman.\r\n\r\nP. 78, c. 2.—“Hessian,” hĕsh´an. The troops were from Hesse-Cassel. The\r\nking, Frederick II., between 1776 and 1784, received over £3,000,000 by\r\nhiring these soldiers to the English government to fight against the\r\nAmericans.\r\n\r\n“Lanspach,” lanz´päk; “Kniphausen,” knip´how=´=zen.\r\n\r\nP. 79, c. 1.—“Brougham,” broo´am. (1779-1868.) A British statesman\r\nand author. After leaving school he spent some time in traveling\r\nand writing before being admitted to the bar. In 1810 he entered\r\nParliament, and his first resolution was to petition the king to\r\nabolish slavery. From this time he was allied with the reforms of the\r\nage: the emancipation of Roman Catholics, government reforms, etc. The\r\neducation of working people and charity schemes received the aid of his\r\npen and voice, and he was instrumental in founding several societies\r\nsince very powerful. In 1834 the change of ministry ended his official\r\nlife, but his interest and zeal in public works never ceased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRICKS OF THE CONJURORS.\r\n\r\nBy THOMAS FROST.\r\n\r\nThe dense ignorance which prevailed during the seventeenth century\r\non the subject of conjuring, as the word is now understood, would be\r\nscarcely credible at the present day, if instances did not even now\r\noccur at intervals to show that there are still minds which the light\r\nof knowledge has not yet penetrated. Books did not reach the masses in\r\nthose days, and hence the beginning of the eighteenth century found\r\npeople as ready to drown a wizard as their ancestors had been.\r\n\r\nA book which was published in 1716, by Richard Neve, whose name is the\r\nfirst which we meet with in the conjuring annals of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, bears traces of the lingering fear of diabolical agency\r\nwhich still infected the minds of the people. Having stated, in his\r\npreface, that his book contained directions for performing thirty-three\r\nlegerdemain tricks, besides many arithmetical puzzles and many jests,\r\nNeve says: “I dare not say that I have here set down all that are or\r\nmay be performed by legerdemain, but thou hast here the most material\r\nof them; and if thou rightly understandest these, there is not a trick\r\nthat any juggler in the world can show thee, but thou shalt be able to\r\nconceive after what manner it is done, if he do it by sleight of hand,\r\nand not by unlawful and detestable means, as too many do at this day.”\r\n\r\nThe following are a few of the tricks which puzzled the people of\r\nthose days: The tricks of the fakirs, or religious mendicants of India\r\nwere remarkable. One of these fellows boasted that he would appear at\r\nAmadabant a town about two hundred miles from Surat, within fifteen\r\ndays after being buried, ten feet deep, at the latter place. The\r\nGovernor of Surat resolved to test the fellow’s powers, and had a grave\r\ndug, in which the fakir placed himself, stipulating that a layer of\r\nreeds should be interposed between his body and the superincumbent\r\nearth, with a space of two feet between his body and the reeds. This\r\nwas done, and the grave was then filled up, and a guard was placed at\r\nthe spot to prevent trickery.\r\n\r\nA large tree stood ten or twelve yards from the grave, and beneath its\r\nshade several fakirs were grouped around a large earthern jar, which\r\nwas filled with water. The officer of the guard, suspecting that some\r\ntrick was to be played, ordered the jar to be moved, and, this being\r\ndone by the soldiers, after some opposition on the part of the fellows\r\nassembled round it, a shaft was discovered, with a subterranean gallery\r\nfrom its bottom to within two feet of the grave. The impostor was\r\nthereupon made to ascend, and a riot ensued, in which he and several\r\nother persons were slain.\r\n\r\nThis trick has been repeated several times in India, under different\r\ncircumstances, one of the most remarkable instances being that related\r\nby an engineer officer named Boileau, who was employed about forty\r\nyears ago in the trigonometrical survey of that country. I shall relate\r\nthis story in the officer’s own words, premising that he did not\r\nwitness either the interment or the exhumation of the performer, but\r\nwas told that they took place in the presence of Esur Lal, one of the\r\nministers of the Muharwul of Jaisulmer.\r\n\r\n“The man is said, by long practice, to have acquired the art of\r\nholding his breath by shutting the mouth, and stopping the interior\r\nopening of the nostrils with his tongue; he also abstains from solid\r\nfood for some days previous to his interment, so that he may not be\r\ninconvenienced by the contents of his stomach, while put up in his\r\nnarrow grave; and, moreover, he is sewn up in a bag of cloth, and the\r\ncell is lined with masonry, and floored with cloth, that the white ants\r\nand other insects may not easily be able to molest him. The place in\r\nwhich he was buried at Jaisulmer is a small building about twelve feet\r\nby eight, built of stone; and in the floor was a hole, about three\r\nfeet long, two and a half feet wide, and the same depth, or perhaps a\r\nyard deep, in which he was placed in a sitting posture, sewed up in\r\nhis shroud, with his feet turned inward toward the stomach, and his\r\nhands also pointed inward toward the chest. Two heavy slabs of stone,\r\nfive or six feet long, several inches thick, and broad enough to cover\r\nthe mouth of the grave, so that he could not escape, were then placed\r\nover him, and I believe a little earth was plastered over the whole,\r\nso as to make the surface of the grave smooth and compact. The door of\r\nthe house was also built up, and people placed outside, that no tricks\r\nmight be played, nor deception practised.\r\n\r\n“At the expiration of a full month, the walling of the door was broken,\r\nand the buried man dug out of the grave; Trevelyan’s moonshee only\r\nrunning there in time to see the ripping open of the bag in which the\r\nman had been inclosed. He was taken out in a perfectly senseless state,\r\nhis eyes closed, his hands cramped and powerless, his stomach shrunk\r\nvery much, and his teeth jammed so fast together that they were forced\r\nto open his mouth with an iron instrument to pour a little water down\r\nhis throat. He gradually recovered his senses and the use of his limbs;\r\nand when we went to see him he was sitting up, supported by two men,\r\nand conversed with us in a low, gentle tone of voice, saying that ‘we\r\nmight bury him again for a twelvemonth, if we pleased.’”\r\n\r\nA conjuror was exhibiting a mimic swan, which floated on real water,\r\nand followed his motions, when the bird suddenly became stationary. He\r\napproached it more closely, but the swan did not move.\r\n\r\n“There is a person in the company,” said he, “who understands the\r\nprinciple upon which this trick is performed, and who is counteracting\r\nme. I appeal to the company whether this is fair, and I beg the\r\ngentleman will desist.”\r\n\r\nThe trick was performed by magnetism, and the counteracting agency was\r\na magnet in the pocket of Sir Francis Blake Delaval.\r\n\r\nIn 1785 the celebrated automatic chess player was first exhibited in\r\nLondon, having previously been shown in various cities of Germany and\r\nFrance. It had been invented about fifteen years before by a Hungarian\r\nnoble, the Baron von Kempelen, who had until then, however, declined to\r\npermit its exhibition in public. Having witnessed some experiments in\r\nmagnetism by a Frenchman, performed before the Court of Maria Theresa,\r\nKempelen had observed to the empress that he thought himself able to\r\nconstruct a piece of mechanism the operations of which would be far\r\nmore surprising than the experiments they had witnessed. The curiosity\r\nof the empress was excited, and she exacted a promise from Kempelen to\r\nmake the attempt. The result was the automatic chess-player.\r\n\r\nThe figure was of the size of life, dressed as a Turk, and seated\r\nbehind a square piece of cabinet work. It was fixed upon castors, so as\r\nto run over the floor, and satisfy beholders that there was no access\r\nto it from below. On the top, in the center, was a fixed chess-board,\r\ntoward which the eyes of the figure were directed. Its right hand and\r\narm were extended toward the board, and its left, somewhat raised, held\r\na pipe.\r\n\r\nThe spectators, having examined the figure, the exhibitor wound up\r\nthe machinery, placed the cushion under the arm of the figure, and\r\nchallenged any gentleman present to play.\r\n\r\nThe Turk always chose the white men, and made the first move. The\r\nfingers opened as the hand was extended toward the board, and the piece\r\nwas deftly picked up, and removed to the proper square. If a false move\r\nwas made by its opponent, it tapped on the table impatiently, replaced\r\nthe piece, and claimed the move for itself. If a human player hesitated\r\nlong over a move, the Turk tapped sharply on the table.\r\n\r\nThe mind fails to comprehend any mechanism capable of performing with\r\nsuch accuracy movements which require knowledge and reflection. Beckman\r\nsays indeed that a boy was concealed in the figure, and prompted by the\r\nbest chess-player whose services the proprietor could obtain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTALK ABOUT BOOKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOliver Wendell Holmes is a philanthropist in the world of letters.\r\nSince his college days at Harvard, where he distinguished himself by\r\nhis contributions to the _Collegian_, he has been giving to his wide\r\ncircle of readers strong, clean, good thoughts, mixed with the happiest\r\nhumor. His essays have been among the most enjoyable of his writings.\r\nHis publishers have recognized this and collected a dozen of them into\r\n“Pages from an Old Volume of Life.”[K] There are many subjects touched,\r\nbut his “Phi Beta Kappa” oration of 1870, “Mechanism in Thought and\r\nMorals,” is, perhaps, the best in the collection. The two essays,\r\nwritten during the war for _The Atlantic_ readers, have a pathos so\r\ntouching, it completely does away with the false idea that Holmes is\r\nonly a humorist. The volume is a pleasant book for an hour’s reading;\r\nindeed, it may well be classed along with what the author himself has\r\naptly called “pillow-smoothing authors;” not a dull, heavy book, but\r\none whose easily-flowing thoughts and continued good humor, quiet the\r\nmind and allow the reader to pass into dreamy forgetfulness.\r\n\r\n“Things that have to be done, should be learned by doing them.”\r\nTeachers know as well, perhaps, as any class of people how applicable\r\nthis old truism is to their work. They only learn by doing; but too\r\noften they learn the routine, not the science. A little book just\r\npublished by A. Lovell & Co.,[L] is sent out in the interest of\r\nthoughtful teaching. There are some excellent development lessons, in\r\nwhich, simply by questions, and a few simple materials, are developed\r\nideas of the senses, of forms, flat and solid, ideas of right and\r\nleft, etc. A series of lessons on plants and insects have for their\r\nobject “to bring the child into contact with nature, to teach him to\r\nobserve, think, reason, and to express himself naturally.” The book\r\ncontains an excellent paper on the much-discussed “Quincy School\r\nWork.” No new departure in the educational world has caused more talk.\r\nThat there is something in it no one doubts that knows of the results\r\nof Superintendent Parker’s system, but how to use it is not easily\r\nexplained. This essay will help teachers to understand the method and\r\nshow them how it may be used.\r\n\r\nDuring this year Messrs. Harper & Brothers have added to the\r\nbiographies of eminent Americans three very valuable works. Following\r\nMr. Godwin’s life of Bryant, is the “Memoirs of John A. Dix.”[M] In so\r\npretentious a work as the latter it is unfortunate that the compilation\r\nshould have been made by his son. The unbiased, impersonal judgment\r\nthat makes a biography trustworthy, is wanting. The fondness of the\r\nwriter is continually evident to the reader. The book, however, is\r\nvaluable from its fullness and exactness. It is really an epitome of\r\nthe history of the most exciting times in our annals. General Dix’s\r\npart in the stirring events before and after the rebellion, his work\r\nas secretary of the treasury, as military commander during the New\r\nYork riots in ’63, and his position upon various questions of national\r\npolicy, are all explained minutely, and his correspondence is given in\r\nfull. Although so voluminous, the work is never fatiguing. A feature\r\nwhich adds to the interest of the book is the selections from his\r\ntranslations, sketches, etc. General Dix added to his political and\r\nmilitary ability a literary taste that led him to cultivate letters.\r\nHis translations are particularly good. _Stabat Mater_, his son has\r\nseen fit to publish; it seems a pity that _Dies Iræ_ was not also given.\r\n\r\nThe third of these biographies is the “Life of James Buchanan.”[N]\r\nThe author himself says of this work, that “it was followed within a\r\nweek by an amount of criticism such as I do not remember to have seen\r\nbestowed on any similar book in the same space of time.” Mr. Curtis was\r\nassigned a task from which most men would have shrunk. Mr. Buchanan’s\r\nadministration as President of the United States was not popular. The\r\nbelief that he favored the secession of the Southern States has been\r\ngeneral. For his biographer to treat him as a conscientious actor in\r\nthe struggle before the war has necessarily entailed criticism. Mr.\r\nCurtis says in his preface, “My estimate of his abilities and powers as\r\na statesman has arisen with every investigation I have made and it is,\r\nin my judgment, not too much to say of him as a President of the United\r\nStates, that he is entitled to stand very high in the catalogue—not\r\na large one—of those who have had the moral courage to encounter\r\nmisrepresentation and obloquy, rather than swerve from the line of\r\nduty which their convictions marked out for them.” Mr. Curtis will not\r\nchange the popular opinion on the Buchanan administration, but he must\r\nmodify that opinion. This treatment alone makes the work worth reading\r\nby both friend and foe. The most entertaining part of the book is the\r\nvoluminous private correspondence, which well portray Mr. Buchanan’s\r\nsocial and friendly nature.\r\n\r\nOne of the most delightful books of the season is “Spanish Vistas,”[O]\r\nby Mr. Lathrop. The publishers have given us a genuine _édition de\r\nluxe_, heavy paper, numberless choice illustrations, and beautiful\r\nbinding. The book is the joint product of two artists, and if one\r\nwields the quill instead of the pencil he is no less artistic. Two\r\nthings are particularly noticeable in Mr. Lathrop’s fine descriptions\r\nof scenery, of architecture, city sights and peasant gatherings: the\r\nskill with which he chooses his point and time of observation, and\r\nhis really superior coloring. He knows at what hour the Alhambra will\r\nexercise its supreme spell, where the picturesque vagabondism of these\r\nhandsome Spanish rascals will be most striking. To this power add his\r\nability in colors and there is not a page but glows with effective\r\npictures. Character sketches enliven the volume. The commonplace\r\nAmerican abroad is introduced in Whetstone, a man of “iron persistence\r\nand intense prejudice,” who continually exclaims “I don’t see what\r\nI came to Spain for. If there ever was a God-forsaken country,” and\r\nwho amid the grandeur of the cathedral of Seville squints along the\r\ncornice to see if it is straight. The writer has been ably assisted by\r\nhis “Velveteen,” alias Mr. C. S. Reinhart, whose pictures give doubled\r\nvalue to the book. To all contemplating a trip to Spain the chapter on\r\n“Hints to Travelers” will be valuable.\r\n\r\n“Spanish Vistas” represents one class of books on travels. There is\r\nanother more interesting to the majority of people, in which facts\r\nand adventures are the chief elements. Such a work is “The Golden\r\nChersonese,”[P] by Isabella Bird. After having traveled on horseback\r\nthrough the interior of Japan, and braved the roughest passes of the\r\nRocky Mountains, and spent six months among the wonders of the Sandwich\r\nIslands, this indefatigable woman penetrates that _terra incognita_,\r\nthe Malay Peninsula. The dangers and inconveniences which she undergoes\r\nto get there and get through are remarkable. She sailed from Hong Kong\r\nnot long after a party of piratical Chinese, shipping as steerage\r\npassengers on board a river steamer, had massacred the officers and\r\ncaptured the boat. There was but one English passenger on board besides\r\nherself, and some two thousand Chinese imprisoned in the steerage, an\r\niron grating over each exit, and an officer ready to shoot the first\r\nman who attempted to force it. The decorations of the saloons consisted\r\nof stands of loaded rifles and unsheathed bayonets. She penetrates the\r\ncountry where the mosquitoes are a terror to life; snakes, land-leeches\r\nand centipedes are everywhere, but the enthusiastic traveler mentions\r\nthem but casually. The dangers and bravery of the writer of course add\r\npiquancy to the interesting description of the scenes, the customs and\r\npeculiarities of “The Golden Chersonese.”\r\n\r\nAlong with these fresh works comes out a new edition of one of the\r\npioneers in this field of literature. We refer to Dr. Hayes’ “Arctic\r\nBoat Journey.”[Q] In 1860 it was first published, and speedily took\r\nits place as an authority on Arctic travels. The fresh interest given\r\nto this subject by the sad fate of the “Jeannette” has led to a new\r\nedition. The accounts lose nothing of interest by time, but rather\r\nbecome clearer from the added knowledge we have of the frozen seas and\r\nicy lands.\r\n\r\nNo work will be found a more valuable addition to a C. L. S. C. library\r\nthan Lübke’s “History of Art.”[R] In connection with the art readings\r\nit will be found invaluable. Since its first publication in 1860 it has\r\ngone through seven editions, and that, too, in critical Germany.

Together with a Catalogue of\r\n    a Reference Library of Biblical Study. By CHARLES A.\r\n    BRIGGS, D.D., Professor of Hebrew and Cognate Languages\r\n    in Union Theological Seminary. 1 vol. 12mo, $2.50.\r\n\r\nProfessor Briggs’ book is admirably adapted for the use of the great\r\nnumber of readers and Bible students who desire to know the results\r\nof the most recent investigation and the best modern scholarship in\r\nthe field of Biblical Study. Without such a guide it is impossible to\r\ncomprehend the discussions which now agitate the religious world as\r\nto the canon, the languages, the style, the text, the interpretation,\r\nand the criticism of Scripture. Each of these departments, with other\r\nkindred topics, is treated in a brief but thorough and comprehensive\r\nmanner, and their history and literature are presented together with\r\ntheir present aspect.\r\n\r\n    =The Scriptural Idea of Man.= By MARK HOPKINS, D.D.,\r\n    LL.D., 1 vol., 12mo, $1.00.\r\n\r\n“We wish every theological student in the land might have the chance,\r\nat least, of reading this book. The doctrines of the Bible in relation\r\nto man in his original nature have seldom been more powerfully\r\nenforced, and the different schools of modern infidelity have seldom\r\nbeen exposed more completely in all their weakness. It is like taking a\r\ntonic or a breath of mountain air for one to listen to such teachings\r\nas the pen of Doctor Hopkins here gives to the younger race of\r\nministers.”—_The Christian Intelligencer._\r\n\r\n    =The Grounds of Theistic and Christian Belief.=\r\n    By GEORGE P. FISHER, D.D., LL.D., Professor of\r\n    Ecclesiastical History in Yale College, 1 vol., crown\r\n    8vo. $2.50.\r\n\r\nThis volume embraces a discussion of the evidences of both natural and\r\nrevealed religion, and prominence is given to topics having special\r\ninterest at present from their connection with modern theories and\r\ndifficulties. Professor Fisher’s learning, skill in argument, and\r\npower of language have given him the position of one of the foremost\r\ndefenders of the faith now living, and this volume will be useful to\r\nmany in clearing up perplexities and throwing new light upon the nature\r\nof the Christian faith and its relation to modern thought.\r\n\r\n    =Christian Charity in the Ancient Church.= By\r\n    Dr. GERHARD UHLHORN, author of “The Conflict of\r\n    Christianity with Heathenism.” 1 vol. crown 8vo, $2.50.\r\n\r\nDr. Uhlhorn is favorably known on this side of the Atlantic by his able\r\nand fascinating treatment of one of the most important chapters in\r\nhistory, “The Conflict of Christianity with Heathenism.”\r\n\r\n    =The Life of Luther.= By JULIUS KOSTLIN, Professor\r\n    in the University of Halle. With more than 60\r\n    illustrations from original portraits, documents, etc.\r\n    1 vol. 8vo.\r\n\r\n“At last we have a life of Luther which deserves the name.... The Herr\r\nKostlin, in a single well-composed volume, has produced a picture which\r\nleaves little to be desired. A student who has read these six hundred\r\npages attentively will have no question left to ask.”—JAMES ANTHONY\r\nFROUDE in _The Contemporary Review_.\r\n\r\n    =The Middle Kingdom.= A survey of the Geography,\r\n    Government, Literature, Social Life, Arts, and History\r\n    of the Chinese Empire and its inhabitants. With\r\n    illustrations and a new map of the Empire. By S. WELLS\r\n    WILLIAMS, D.D., LL.D. 2 vols. royal 8vo, $9.00.\r\n\r\nThis new issue of Dr. S. Wells Williams’s standard and important work,\r\n“The Middle Kingdom,” is practically a new book. The text of the old\r\nedition has been largely rewritten, and the work has been expanded so\r\nas to include a vast amount of new material collected by Dr. Williams\r\nduring the later years of his residence in China, as well as the most\r\nrecent information regarding all the departments of the Empire.\r\n\r\n    =The Story of Roland.= By JAMES BALDWIN. With a series\r\n    of illustrations by R. B. Birch. 1 vol. square 12mo,\r\n    $2.00.\r\n\r\nThis volume is intended as a companion to “The Story of Siegfried.” As\r\n“Siegfried” was an adaptation of Northern myths and romances to the\r\nwants and understanding of young readers, so is this story a similar\r\nadaptation of the Middle Age romances relating to Charlemagne and his\r\npaladins.\r\n\r\n    =The Hoosier School-Boy.= By EDWARD EGGLESTON, author\r\n    of “The Hoosier School-Master,” etc. With full-page\r\n    illustrations. 1 vol. 12mo, $1.00.\r\n\r\n“Those who have read ‘The Hoosier School-master’—and who has not?—will\r\nfeel that they must have this companion volume. Mr. Eggleston is a\r\nwriter of very charming stories of a peculiar character. His stories\r\nalways mean something, and are pervaded by a Christian tone of thought\r\nand feeling.”—_Christian Secretary, Hartford._\r\n\r\n    =Mrs. Gilpin’s Frugalities.= Remnants, and 200 Ways of\r\n    Using Them. By SUSAN ANNA BROWN, author of “The Book of\r\n    Forty Puddings.” 1 vol. illuminated, $1.\r\n\r\nThis little volume, which in the range of cook-book literature occupies\r\na new and unoccupied field, aims to combat the spirit of wastefulness\r\nthat is the besetting sin of American housekeeping. Miss Brown provides\r\na multitude of receipts for transforming these remnants into savory and\r\nnutritious _plats_, side dishes, entrees, etc. Some of these receipts\r\nare from the French, but most of them are from the author’s own\r\nexperiments.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _These books are for sale by all book-sellers, or will\r\n    be sent, post-paid, on receipt of price._\r\n\r\n    CHARLES SCRIBNER’S SONS, Publishers,\r\n    743 and 745 Broadway, New York.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTranscriber’s Note:\r\n\r\nObvious punctuation errors repaired.\r\n\r\nPage 66, “Muremburg” changed to “Nuremburg” (of Nuremburg, is now)\r\n\r\nPage 81, “Lybia” changed to “Libya” (deserts of Libya, there dwelt)\r\n\r\nPage 82, “Fresho” changed to “Fresno” (four chief towns, Fresno)\r\n\r\nPage 88, “Propylænm” changed to “Propylæum” (the Propylæum and enter)\r\n\r\nPage 97, “ti” changed to “it” (huzzaing for me; it)\r\n\r\nPage 98, stanza break placed between first and second stanza of poem.\r\n\r\nPage 103, “Lousta” changed to “Louisa” (Lousia E.
