I suppose a man of 76 may be called \"old,\"\r\nalthough I have by no means given up the idea that I can still be of use\r\nto my country.\r\n\r\nAnd a Rebel? Yes! Anything of the nature of injustice or oppression has\r\nalways stirred me to resentment, and--is it to be wondered at?--most of\r\nall when the victims of that injustice and oppression have been my own\r\npeople. And why not? If there were no rebels against wrong-doing,\r\nwrong-doing would prosper. To an Irishman, who is a fighter by\r\ntemperament, and a fighter by choice against those in high places, life\r\nis sure to provide plenty of excitement; and that, no doubt, is why my\r\nfriends have thought my recollections worth printing. The curious thing\r\nis that my share in the struggle for Irish self-government has been\r\nalmost entirely what I might call outpost work, for I have lived all my\r\nlife in England.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it seemed but a stroke of good luck that I was born in Ireland\r\nat all. My father (John, son of James Denvir, of Ballywalter, Lecale)\r\ncame to England in the early part of the last century, and settled in\r\nLiverpool, where my eldest brother was born. It was during a brief\r\nperiod, when our family returned to Ireland, that I and a younger\r\nbrother were born there. My father was engaged for about three years as\r\nclerk of the works for the erection of a castle for Sir Francis\r\nMacnaghten, near Bushmills, County Antrim. This must be one of the least\r\nCatholic parts of Ireland, for there was no resident priest, and I had\r\nto be taken a long distance to be christened. There was a decent\r\nCatholic workman at the castle, James MacGowan, who was my god-father,\r\nand my Aunt Kitty had to come all the way from \"our own place\" in the\r\nCounty Down to be my god-mother.\r\n\r\nBrought to England, my earliest remembrances are of Liverpool, which has\r\na more compact and politically important Irish population than any other\r\ntown in Great Britain.\r\n\r\nAnyone who has mixed much among our fellow-countrymen in England,\r\nScotland and Wales knows that, generally, the children and grandchildren\r\nof Irish-born parents consider themselves just as much Irish as those\r\nborn on \"the old sod\" itself. No part of our race has shown more\r\ndetermination and enthusiasm in the cause of Irish nationality. As a\r\nrule the Irish of Great Britain have been well organised, and, during\r\nthe last sixty years and more, have been brought into constant contact\r\nwith a host of distinguished Irishmen--including the leaders of the\r\nconstitutional political organisations--from Daniel O'Connell to John\r\nRedmond.\r\n\r\nI have taken an active part in the various Irish movements of my time,\r\nand it so happens that, while I know so little personally of Ireland\r\nitself, there are few, if any, living Irishmen who have had such\r\nexperience, from actual personal contact with them, as I have had of our\r\npeople in every part of Great Britain. As will be seen, too, in the\r\ncourse of these recollections, circumstances have brought me into\r\nintimate connection with most of the Irish political leaders.\r\n\r\nMy father came to England in one of the sloops in which our people used\r\nto \"come over\" in the old days. They sometimes took a week in crossing.\r\nThe steamers which superseded them, though an immense improvement as\r\nregards speed, had often less accommodation for the deck passengers than\r\nfor the cattle they brought over.\r\n\r\nMost of the Irish immigration to Liverpool came through the Clarence\r\nDock, where the steamers used to land our people from all parts. Since\r\nthe Railway Company diverted a good deal of the Irish traffic through\r\nthe Holyhead route, there are not so many of these steamers coming to\r\nLiverpool as formerly.\r\n\r\nThe first object that used to meet the eyes of those who had just \"come\r\nover,\" as they looked across the Clarence Dock wall, was an effigy of\r\nSt. Patrick, with a shamrock in his hand, as if welcoming them from \"the\r\nold sod.\" This was placed high upon the wall of a public house kept by\r\na retired Irish pugilist, Jack Langan. In the thirties and forties of\r\nthe last century, up to 1846, when he died, leaving over £20,000 to his\r\nchildren, Langan's house was a very popular resort of Irishmen, more\r\nparticularly as, besides being a decent, warm-hearted, open-handed man,\r\nhe was a strong supporter of creed and country.\r\n\r\nI am old enough to remember hearing Mass in what was an interesting\r\nrelic in Liverpool of the Penal days. This was the old building known to\r\nour people as \"Lumber Street Chapel.\" Of course, the present Protestant\r\nChurch of St. Nicholas (known as \"the old church\") is a Catholic\r\nfoundation. Lumber Street chapel was not, however, the first of our\r\nplaces of worship built during the Penal days, for the Jesuits had a\r\nsmall chapel not far off, erected early in the eighteenth century, but\r\ndestroyed by a No-Popery mob in 1746. St. Mary's, Lumber Street, too,\r\nwas originally a Jesuit mission, but, in 1783, it was handed over to the\r\nBenedictines, who have had charge of it ever since. Father John Price,\r\nS.J., built a chapel in Sir Thomas's Buildings in 1788. I can recollect\r\nthis building since my earliest days, but Mass was never said in it\r\nduring my time.\r\n\r\nLancashire is the only part of England where there are any great number\r\nof the native population who have always kept the faith. I once spent a\r\nfew weeks in one of these Catholic districts. My employer had an\r\nalteration to make in the house of a gentleman at Lydiate, near\r\nOrmskirk. I used to come home to Liverpool for the Sundays, but for the\r\nrest of the week I had lodgings in the house of a Catholic family at\r\nLydiate.\r\n\r\nThere was an old ruin, which they called Lydiate Abbey, but I found it\r\nwas the chapel of St. Catherine, erected in the fifteenth century. The\r\npriest of the mission had charge of the chapel which, though unroofed,\r\nwas the most perfect ecclesiastical ruin in Catholic hands in South\r\nLancashire. During the time I was at Lydiate there came a Holiday of\r\nObligation, when I heard Mass in the house of a Catholic farmer named\r\nRimmer. This was a fine old half-timbered building of Elizabethan days,\r\nand here, all through the Penal times, Mass had been kept up, a priest\r\nto say it being always in hiding somewhere in the district.\r\n\r\nThe priest in charge of Lydiate at the time I was there told me he was\r\ncollecting for a regular church or chapel, and hoped soon to make a\r\ncommencement of the building. Some years later he was able to do so. Our\r\nchurch choir at Copperas Hill, Liverpool, was then considered one of the\r\nbest in the diocese. The choirmaster and organist, John Richardson, was\r\na distinguished composer of Catholic church music, and held in such high\r\nesteem that, for any important celebration, he could always secure the\r\nservices of the chief members of the musical profession in and about\r\nLiverpool. In this way, on one occasion Miss Santley came to help us.\r\nShe was accompanied by her brother, then a boy, who has since risen to\r\nthe highest position in the musical world--the eminent baritone, Sir\r\nCharles Santley.\r\n\r\nSt. Nicholas' was, as it is yet, the pro-Cathedral of the diocese, and\r\nwhenever a new church had to be opened, or there was any important\r\nceremonial anywhere in Lancashire, our choir was generally invited. In\r\nthis way I was delighted to go to the opening of the new church at\r\nLydiate, so that I was taking part in the third stage of the Catholic\r\nhistory of the diocese--having said a prayer in the old ruin, and\r\nattended Mass in Rimmer's, and now assisting at the solemn High Mass at\r\nthe opening of the Church of our Lady, not far from the old chapel of\r\nSt. Catherine.\r\n\r\nAt the time I went to Mass in Lumber Street Chapel, Liverpool, which is\r\nnearly 70 years since, there were but four other _chapels_, as they were\r\ngenerally called then, in the town--Copperas Hill (St. Nicholas'), Seel\r\nStreet (St. Peter's), St. Anthony's and St. Patrick's. It must have been\r\na custom acquired in the Penal days to call the older Catholic places of\r\nworship rather after the names of the streets in which they were\r\nsituated than of the saint to whom they were dedicated. During the\r\nFamine years the bishops and clergy must have found it extremely\r\ndifficult to provide for the tremendous influx of our people. I have\r\nseen them crowded out into the chapel yards and into the open streets;\r\nsatisfied if they could get even a glimpse of the inside of the sacred\r\nbuilding through an open window. I see by the Catholic Directory there\r\nare at the time I now write thirty-nine churches and chapels in\r\nLiverpool. The schools have increased in a like proportion.\r\n\r\nThe progress in numbers, wealth and influence of the Irish people may\r\nbe pretty well marked by the gradual increase in the number of churches\r\nand schools, which have been built for the most part by the Irish and\r\ntheir descendants. All honour to the noble-hearted, hard-handed toilers\r\nwho have contributed to such work, and greater glory still to the humble\r\nmen who, after a hard week's work in a ship's hold at the docks, or\r\nperhaps in the \"jigger loft\" of a warehouse eight stories high, turn\r\nout every Sunday morning to act as \"collectors,\" and go in pairs from\r\ndoor to door, one with the book and the other with the bag in hand, to\r\nraise the means of erecting the noble churches and schools that\r\neverywhere meet our view in Liverpool to-day.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the social position our people occupy in Liverpool, there\r\nhave been many Irishmen who have come well to the front in the race of\r\nlife, some of whom have occupied the foremost positions in connection\r\nwith the public life of the town. On the other hand; a large number of\r\nour fellow-countrymen in Liverpool are by no means in that enviable\r\ncondition. Many of them have set out from Ireland, intending to go to\r\nAmerica, but, their little means failing them, have been obliged to\r\nremain in Liverpool. Here they considered themselves fortunate if they\r\nmet someone from the same part of the country as themselves to give them\r\na helping hand, for it is a fine trait in the Irish character--and\r\n\"over here in England\" the trait has not been lost--that, however poor,\r\nthey are always ready to befriend what seems to them a still poorer\r\nneighbour. Those who have lived here some time are glad to see someone\r\nfrom their \"own place,\" and, amid the squalor of an English city, the\r\nimaginative Celt--as he listens to the gossip about the changes, the\r\nmarriages, and the deaths that have taken place since he left \"home\r\n\"--for a brief moment lives once more upon \"the old sod,\" and sees\r\nvisions of the little cabin by the wood side where dwelt those he loved,\r\nof the mountain chapel where he worshipped, of a bright-eyed Irish girl\r\nbeloved in the golden days of youth. These and a host of other\r\nassociations of the past come floating back upon his memory, as he hears\r\nthe tidings brought by Terence, or Michael, or Maurya, who has just\r\n\"come over.\" It often so happens that, from the very goodness of the\r\nIrish heart, the newcomers are frequently drawn into the same miserable\r\nmode of life as the friends who have come to England before them may\r\nhave fallen into.\r\n\r\nIrish intellect and Irish courage have in thousands of cases brought our\r\npeople to their proper place in the social scale, but it is only too\r\noften the case that adverse circumstances compel the great bulk of them\r\nto have recourse to the hardest, the most precarious, and the worst paid\r\nemployments to be found in the British labour market.\r\n\r\nIn the large towns, in the poorer streets in which our people live, a\r\nstranger would be struck by the swarms of children, and of an evening,\r\nat the number of grown-up people sitting on the doorsteps of their\r\nwretched habitations. John Barry once told me that a friend of his\r\nasked one of these how they could live in such places? \"Because,\" was\r\nthe reply, \"we live so much _out_ of them.\" The answer showed, at any\r\nrate, that their lot was borne cheerfully.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, there are Irishmen too--men who know how to keep what they\r\nhave earned--who, by degrees, get into the higher circles of the\r\ncommercial world, so that I have seen among the merchant princes \"on\r\n'Change\" in Liverpool men who, themselves, or whose fathers before them,\r\ncommenced life in the humblest avocations.\r\n\r\nLiverpool has, on the whole, been a \"stony-hearted stepmother\" to its\r\nIrish colony, which largely built its granite sea-walls, and for many\r\nyears humbly did the laborious work on which the huge commerce of the\r\nport rested. But, perhaps, in years to come Liverpool will realise the\r\nvalue of the wealth of human brains and human hearts which it held for\r\nso long unregarded or despised in its midst.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nDISTINGUISHED IRISHMEN--\"THE NATION\" NEWSPAPER--\"THE HIBERNIANS.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI have met, as I have said elsewhere, most of the Irish political\r\nleaders of my time in Liverpool, but I will always remember with what\r\npleasure I listened to a distinguished Irishman of another type, Samuel\r\nLover, when he was travelling with an entertainment consisting of\r\nsketches from his own works and selections from his songs. Few men were\r\nmore versatile than Lover, for he was a painter, musician, composer,\r\nnovelist, poet, and dramatist. When I saw him in one of the public halls\r\nhe sang his own songs, told his own stories, and was his own\r\naccompanist.\r\n\r\nHis was one of a series of performances, very popular in Liverpool for\r\nmany years, called the \"Saturday Evening Concerts.\" He was a little man,\r\nwith what might be called something of a \"Frenchified\" style about him,\r\nbut having with it all a bright eye and thoroughly Irish face which,\r\nwith all his bodily movements, displayed great animation. I can readily\r\nbelieve his biographers, who say he excelled in all the arts he\r\ncultivated, for his was a most charming entertainment.\r\n\r\nLover undoubtedly had patriotism of a kind, and some of his songs show\r\nit. It certainly was not up to the mark of the \"Young Irelanders,\" one\r\nof whom attacked him on one occasion, when he made the clever retort\r\nthat \"the fount from which _he_ drew his patriotism was a more genuine\r\nsource than a fount of Irish type\"--alluding to the plentiful use of the\r\nGaelic characters in \"The Spirit of the Nation,\" the world-famed\r\ncollection of songs by the Young Ireland contributors to the \"Nation\"\r\nnewspaper. There are passages in Lover's novel of \"Rory O'More\" and his\r\n\"He Would be a Gentleman\" that show he was a sincere lover of his\r\ncountry. I agree in the main with what the \"Nation\" said of him in\r\n1843--\"Though he often fell into ludicrous exaggerations and burlesques\r\nin describing Irish life, there is a good national spirit running\r\nthrough the majority of his works, for which he has not received due\r\ncredit.\"\r\n\r\nOne of his stories, \"Rory O'More,\" achieved universal popularity also as\r\na play, a song and an air. In it there is a passage which, when I first\r\nread it, I looked upon as an exaggeration, and as somewhat reflecting\r\nupon the dignity of a great national movement like that of the United\r\nIrishmen. Lover brings his hero, Rory, into somewhat questionable\r\nsurroundings in a Munster town--intended for Cork or some other\r\nseaport--to meet a French emissary. One would think that a struggle for\r\nthe freedom of Ireland should be carried on amongst the most lofty\r\nsurroundings. But I found in after life that the incidents described by\r\nLover were not so exaggerated as might be supposed, for, as \"necessity\r\nhas no law,\" during a later revolutionary struggle we had often to meet\r\nin strange and unromantic places, as I shall describe later, for most\r\nimportant projects.\r\n\r\nLover's wit was spontaneous, and bubbled over in his ordinary\r\nconversation with friends. An English lady friend, deeply interested in\r\nIreland, once said to him--\"I believe I was intended for an Irishwoman.\"\r\nLover gallantly replied--\"Cross over to Ireland and they will swear you\r\nwere intended for an Irishman.\"\r\n\r\nA famous Irishman, whom I saw in Liverpool when I was a boy, was the\r\nApostle of Temperance, Father Mathew.\r\n\r\nAt this time he visited many centres of Irishmen in Great Britain, and\r\nadministered the pledge of total abstinence from intoxicating drink to\r\nmany thousands of his fellow-countrymen. In London alone over 70,000\r\ntook the pledge. As in Ireland, this brought about a great social\r\nrevolution. The temperance movement certainly helped O'Connell's Repeal\r\nagitation, which was in its full flood about this time.\r\n\r\nMy remembrance of Father Mathew was that of a man of portly figure,\r\nrather under than above the middle height, with a handsome, pleasant\r\nface. He had a fine powerful voice, which could be heard at the furthest\r\nextremity of his gatherings, which often numbered several thousands. As\r\nhe gave out the words of the pledge to abstain, with the Divine\r\nassistance, from all intoxicating liquors, he laid great emphasis on the\r\nword \"liquors,\" pronouncing the last syllable of the word with almost\r\nexaggerated distinctness. After this he would go round the ring of those\r\nkneeling to take the pledge, and put round the neck of each the ribbon\r\nwith the medal attached.\r\n\r\nI ought to remember his visit to Liverpool, for I took the pledge from\r\nhim three times during his stay in the town.\r\n\r\nMy mother took the whole family, and, wherever he was--at St. Patrick's,\r\nor in a great field on one side of Crown Street, or at St.\r\nAnthony's--there she was with her family. She was a woman with the\r\nstrong Irish faith in the supernatural, and in the power of God and His\r\nChurch, that can \"move mountains.\" A younger brother of mine had a\r\nrunning in his foot which the doctors could not cure. She determined to\r\ntake Bernard to Father Mathew and get him to lay his hands on her boy.\r\n\r\nAt St. Patrick's, with her children kneeling around her, she asked the\r\ngood Father to touch her son. He, no doubt thinking it would be\r\npresumptuous on his part to claim any supernatural gift, passed on\r\nwithout complying with her request. Father Mathew's next gathering was\r\nin the Crown Street fields. I was a boy of about nine years, attending\r\nCopperas Hill schools. Mr. Connolly, who was in charge, was a very good\r\nmaster, but there was nothing very Irish in his teaching. Some idea of\r\nthis may be formed when I mention that--though there were not a dozen\r\nboys in the school who were not Irish or of Irish extraction--the first\r\nmap of Ireland I ever saw was on the back of one of O'Connell's Repeal\r\ncards.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the Christian Brothers came, a few years afterwards,\r\nthat this was changed. I shall always be grateful to that noble body of\r\nmen, not only for the religious but for the national training they gave.\r\nWe had Brothers Thornton and Swan--the latter since the Superior of the\r\nOrder in Ireland.\r\n\r\nUnder them we not only had a good map of Ireland, but they taught us, in\r\nour geography lessons, the correct Irish pronunciation of the names of\r\nplaces, such as (spelling phonetically) \"Carrawn Thooal,\" \"Croogh\r\nPhaudhrig,\" and similar words.\r\n\r\nBut our old master, Mr. Connolly, was a good man too, according to his\r\nlights. Hearing of Father Mathew's visit, he asked how many of the boys\r\nwould go to Crown Street to \"take the pledge\"--their parents being\r\nwilling? Out of some 250 boys there were about a dozen who did not hold\r\nup their hands.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary for me to say that my mother was there again with her\r\nafflicted boy and the rest of her children, and again she pleaded in\r\nvain. She was a courageous woman, with great force of character--and a\r\n_third_ time she went to Father Mathew's gathering. This was in St.\r\nAnthony's chapel yard, and amongst the thousands there to hear him and\r\nto take the pledge she awaited her turn. Again she besought him to touch\r\nher boy's foot. He knew her again, and, deeply moved by her importunity\r\nand great faith he, at length, to her great joy, put his hand on my\r\nbrother's foot and gave him his blessing. My mother's faith in the\r\npower of God, through His minister, was rewarded, for the foot was\r\nhealed.\r\n\r\nI had an aunt--my mother's sister--married to a good patriotic Irishman,\r\nHugh, or, as he was more generally called, Hughey, Roney, who kept a\r\npublic house in Crosbie Street. The street is now gone, but it stood on\r\npart of what is now the goods station of the London & North Western\r\nRailway. Nearly all in Crosbie Street were from the West of Ireland,\r\nand, amongst them, there was scarcely anything but Irish spoken. I have\r\noften thought since of the splendid opportunity let slip by O'Connell\r\nand the Repealers in neglecting to revive, as they could so easily have\r\nthen done, so strong a factor in nationality as the native tongue of our\r\npeople. My Aunt Nancy could speak the Northern Irish fluently, and, in\r\nthe course of her business, acquired the Connaught Irish and accent.\r\n\r\nAfter a time Hughey Roney retired, and the house was carried on by his\r\ndaughter and her husband, John McArdle, a good, decent patriotic\r\nIrishman, much respected by his Connaught neighbours, though he was from\r\nthe \"Black North.\" It used to be a great treat to hear John McArdle, on\r\na Sunday night, reading the \"Nation,\" which then cost sixpence, and was,\r\ntherefore, not so easily accessible, to an admiring audience, of whom I\r\nwas sometimes one, and his son, John Francis McArdle, another. This\r\nyounger McArdle, originally intended for the Church, became in after\r\nlife a brilliant journalist, and was for a time on the staff of the\r\n\"Nation,\" the teaching of which he had so early imbibed. The elder\r\nMcArdle was a big, imposing looking man, with a voice to match, who gave\r\nthe speeches of O'Connell and the other orators of Conciliation Hall\r\nwith such effect that the applause was always given exactly in the right\r\nplaces, and with as much heartiness as if greeting the original\r\nspeakers.\r\n\r\nAfter Father Mathew's visit, their trade fell away to such an extent\r\nthat John McArdle, determined to hold his ground--while still keeping\r\nthe public house open, though the business was all but gone--broke\r\nanother door into the street, and made his parlour into a grocery and\r\nprovision store. This enterprise on his part was only necessary for a\r\nshort time, as the abnormal enthusiasm in the cause of temperance which,\r\nfor the time being, had swept all before it, had subsided to such an\r\nextent that McArdle, after a time, turned the room to its original\r\npurpose, and was able to resume his readings from the \"Nation\" to\r\nadmiring audiences, as heretofore.\r\n\r\nYet, though so many fell away from their temporary exaltation, there\r\nwere still large numbers who remained firm, and the lasting good from\r\nFather Mathew's work was undeniable.\r\n\r\nSo popular was John McArdle's house, that it was used as one of the\r\nlodges of the Ancient Order of Hibernians--then very strong in\r\nLiverpool, and stout champions of country and creed. In regard to this\r\norganisation, I find in the \"Irish World\" of New York a high tribute\r\npaid to them by the Very Rev. Thomas J. Shahan, of the Catholic\r\nUniversity of America. In his paper on \"Hibernianism\" he said there was\r\na tradition in the Ancient Order that they first started in Ireland in\r\nthe Penal days as a bodyguard to their poor parish priest when he said\r\nMass in the open air. Anyone who has spent most of his life in England,\r\nas I have done, can well understand that this is not simply an effort of\r\nthis good priest's imagination, for, over and over again I have seen the\r\nHibernians among the first to come forward in defence of their priests\r\nand churches when these were threatened. In the course of his paper Dr.\r\nShahan quoted a letter from the Brethren in Ireland, Scotland and\r\nEngland to the Brethren in New York. It sent instructions and authority\r\nto the few brothers in New York to establish branches of their Society\r\nin America.\r\n\r\nThese were the qualifications laid down: Members must be Catholic and\r\nIrish, or of Irish descent. They must be of good moral character, and\r\nwere not to join in any secret societies contrary to the laws of the\r\nCatholic Church. They were to exercise hospitality towards their\r\nemigrant brothers and to protect their emigrant sisters from all harm\r\nand temptation, so that they should still be known for their chastity\r\nall over the world. The members of the Order in America were to be at\r\nliberty to make laws for the welfare of the Society, but these must be\r\nin accord with the teaching of the Church, and their working must be\r\nsubmitted to a Catholic priest. The letter says--\"We send you these\r\ninstructions, as we promised to do, with a young man that works on the\r\nship and who called on you before.\" Directing that a copy of the\r\ndocument should be sent to another friend, then working in\r\nPennsylvania, the letter concluded--\"Hoping the bearer and this copy\r\nwill land safe and that you will treat him right, we remain your\r\nbrothers in the true bond of friendship this 4th day of May, in the year\r\nof our Lord, 1837\"--\r\n\r\n  \"PATRICK M'GUIRE, County Fermanagh.\r\n  \"JOHN REILLY, County Cavan.\r\n  \"PATRICK M'KENNA, County Monaghan.\r\n  \"JOHN DURKIN, County Mayo.\r\n  \"PATRICK REILLY, County Derry.\r\n  \"PATRICK DOYLE, County Sligo.\r\n  \"JOHN FARRELL, County Meath.\r\n  \"THOMAS O'RORKE, County Leitrim.\r\n  \"JAMES M'MANUS, County Leitrim.\r\n  \"JOHN M'MAHON, County Longford.\r\n  \"PATRICK DUNN, County Tyrone\r\n  \"PATRICK HAMILL, County Westmeath.\r\n  \"DANIEL GALLAGHER, Glasgow.\r\n  \"JOHN MURPHY, Liverpool.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that of the twelve Irish counties represented above,\r\nsix are in the province of Ulster, three in Connaught, and three in\r\nLeinster, so that the Hibernians appear to have had their stronghold in\r\nthe Northern province and the adjoining counties in Connaught and\r\nLeinster. This is exactly as one might expect, seeing the necessity for\r\na defensive organisation against the Orangemen of Ulster. The Order took\r\ndeep root in Glasgow and Liverpool on account of the convenience of\r\naccess by sea from Ireland to these cities.\r\n\r\nI was too young to have known John Murphy, who signed the letter for the\r\nLiverpool Hibernians, but, from what I knew of these afterwards, it is\r\nlikely that he was a dock labourer. As I will show, these men, over and\r\nover again, to my own knowledge, gave splendid proofs of their courage\r\nand love of creed and country. Their love of learning, too, has been\r\nequal to that of their fathers in the days when our country was \"The\r\nIsland of Saints and Scholars.\" Some of these poor men may not have had\r\nmuch learning themselves, but they made great and noble sacrifices that\r\ntheir children should have it. I noted with interest in the Irish papers\r\nrecently that the name of the Secretary of the Hibernian Order at the\r\nBridge of Mayo, County Down, was \"Brother Denvir.\"\r\n\r\nOur country sent over to Liverpool, besides sterling Nationalists, as\r\nbitter a colony of Irishmen--I suppose we can scarcely deny the name to\r\nmen born in Ireland--as were, perhaps, to be found anywhere in the\r\nworld. These were the Orangemen. If there was one place more obnoxious\r\nto them than another it was the club room of the Hibernians in Crosbie\r\nStreet. But though in their frequent conflicts with the \"Papishes\" they\r\nwrecked houses and even killed several Irishmen--for they frequently\r\nused deadly weapons against unarmed Catholics--they were never able to\r\nmake a successful attack on McArdle's. One of my earliest experiences\r\nwas being on the spot on the occasion of a contemplated assault on the\r\nHibernian club room on the day of an Orange anniversary. This was in\r\n1843.\r\n\r\nParallel to Crosbie Street, where the club room was situated, was\r\nBlundell Street, where my uncle, Hughey Roney, lived in a house\r\nimmediately behind McArdle's--the back door of the one house facing the\r\nback door of the other. This side of the street, with the whole of\r\nCrosbie Street, has long since been absorbed by the railway company\r\nbefore mentioned.\r\n\r\nI cannot imagine why my mother chose this particular day to take me to\r\nsee our relatives, except it was the inveterate longing which her early\r\nsurroundings and training had given her to assist at the \"batin' of an\r\nOrangeman,\" or why I should have been the chosen one of the family to\r\ncome, unless it was that she thought I was the one most after her own\r\nheart in her warlike propensities. However this may have been, there we\r\nwere in the first-floor front room of my Uncle Hughey's. Every room,\r\nfrom cellar to garret, was crowded with stalwart dock labourers--at that\r\ntime these were almost to a man Irish--prepared to support another\r\ncontingent of Hibernians who garrisoned McArdle's in a similar manner.\r\nHearing outside the cry--\"he Orangemen!\" I looked out of the window and\r\nup the street, and there, sure enough, was a strong body of them\r\nmarching down, armed with guns, swords, and ship carpenters' hatchets.\r\nAt once the word was passed to the contingent in Crosbie Street to be\r\nprepared to meet the threatened attack.\r\n\r\nNearer and nearer the Orangemen came. They had got within some thirty\r\nyards of Roneys when, between them and the object of their attack, out\r\nof Simpson street, which at this point crosses Blundell Street at right\r\nangles, there intervened the head of a column of police, under the\r\nLiverpool Chief Constable, an Irishman, Michael James Whitty. There was\r\na desperate engagement, but, notwithstanding their murderous weapons,\r\nthe Orangemen were utterly routed, flying before the disciplined charge\r\nof the police, who freely used their batons on their retreating\r\nopponents.\r\n\r\nA few words about Michael James Whitty, who led the charge with right\r\ngood will, may not be inappropriate here. Many years afterwards, when we\r\nwere both engaged in the profession of journalism, I had the pleasure of\r\nmaking his acquaintance through my reviewing in the \"Catholic Times\" a\r\nvery able book of his, a \"Life of Robert Emmet.\" He asked Mr. Thomas\r\nGregson, his private secretary, a friend of mine: Who had written this\r\nreview? Upon hearing who it was, he asked Mr. Gregson to bring us\r\ntogether. When we met, he told me how pleased he was with my review, and\r\nthat there was somebody on the \"Catholic Times\" who could appreciate his\r\nbook.\r\n\r\nHe became Chief Constable of Liverpool in 1828. About this time Messrs.\r\nRockliffs published a weekly newspaper called the \"Liverpool Journal,\"\r\nwhich came into the hands of Mr. Whitty after he had resigned the office\r\nof head constable. An offshoot of the \"Journal\" was the \"Daily Post,\"\r\nwhich, in Mr. Whitty's hands was (and indeed has been ever since under\r\nthe direction of Sir Edward Russell, who still holds the reins) a\r\npowerful organ of Liberalism. One of Whitty's sub-editors on the \"Daily\r\nPost\" was Stephen Joseph Meany, a somewhat prominent figure in the Young\r\nIreland and Fenian movements.\r\n\r\nAs showing the power of the Press, there is no doubt that Whitty and\r\nMeany, in the \"Journal\" and \"Post,\" and through their influence\r\notherwise, did much to secure recognition of a great Irish actor. This\r\nwas Barry Sullivan, who was, I think, the finest tragedian I have ever\r\nseen. He is still remembered with appreciation by many in England, and,\r\nI am sure, in Ireland too.\r\n\r\nHe was a patriotic Irishman, and once offered himself to our committee\r\nas a Nationalist candidate for the Parliamentary representation of\r\nLiverpool. This was in the days when it was a three-membered\r\nconstituency. It was only the belief that the sacrifice which he thus\r\noffered to make for his country would have injured his career as an\r\nactor that prevented us from accepting his offer.\r\n\r\nIn my boyhood a great feature in Liverpool was the annual procession of\r\none or other of the local societies.\r\n\r\nThe great Irish and Catholic procession, of which the Hibernians formed\r\nthe largest contingent, was, of course, on St. Patrick's Day. A\r\nconsiderable portion of the processionists were dock labourers; a fine\r\nbody of men, who were at this time, as I have already said, mostly\r\nIrish.\r\n\r\nThe Orange processions in Liverpool were often the occasion of\r\nbloodshed, for in them they carried guns, hatchets, and other deadly\r\nweapons, as if they were always prepared for deeds of violence. The\r\nship carpenters were the most numerous body in the Orange processions.\r\nIndeed, they formed such a large proportion that, by many, the 12th of\r\nJuly was called \"Carpenter's Day.\" Shipbuilding used to flourish in\r\nLiverpool, and, as none of the firms engaged in it would take a Catholic\r\napprentice, it was quite an Orange preserve. This became somewhat\r\nchanged when the Chalenors, an English Catholic family, who were already\r\nextensive timber merchants, commenced ship-building, and, of course,\r\ntook Catholic apprentices.\r\n\r\nThe Orange ring was thus gradually broken up, and, as iron ships\r\nsuperseded wooden ones, ultimately the shipbuilding trade almost\r\nvanished from Liverpool. The ship carpenters, for the most part, found\r\ntheir occupation gone, and many of them ended their days in the\r\nworkhouse.\r\n\r\nA further instance of the decline of rabid Orangeism might be cited. It\r\nwas not an altogether uncommon thing for people to be fired at from the\r\nwindows of Orange lodges. I see, according to the \"Nation\" of July 20th,\r\n1850, that \"an innkeeper of Liverpool named Wright fired out of his\r\nhouse and wounded three people.\" In justification of this he stated that\r\n\"a crowd of Ribbonmen assembled round his house.\" At one time there used\r\nto be a notorious Orange lodge held in a public house called \"The Wheat\r\nSheaf\" in Scotland Road. The members of this body thought nothing of\r\nfiring upon an unarmed and peaceable crowd from the windows, and I\r\nremember an Irishman being shot dead upon one of these occasions. The\r\nchange that has taken place in this district can be best realized from\r\nthe facts that, in after years, the landlord of \"The Wheatsheaf\" bore\r\nthe name of Patrick Finegan, that, at the present moment, Scotland Road\r\nis, as it has been for many years, represented in the City Council by a\r\nsterling body of Irish Nationalists, and that the Scotland Division of\r\nthe Borough of Liverpool is the _one_ place in Great Britain where an\r\nIrish Home Ruler, _as such_, can be returned to Parliament against all\r\ncomers, as Mr. T.P. O'Connor has been, ever since the Division became a\r\nseparate constituency.\r\n\r\nTo return to the St. Patrick's Day processions. I used to look forward\r\nto them with delight in my childhood, and, even now, cannot help\r\nlingering lovingly on their memory. They were splendid displays, which I\r\ncan remember much better than many things which occurred, so to speak,\r\nbut yesterday.\r\n\r\n\"Our street,\" which was close to Russell Street, Rodney Street, and\r\nother thoroughfares through which the procession passed, was by no means\r\nwhat you would call an Irish street. Indeed, the most influential man in\r\nit was a retired sea captain named Jamieson, who, if not an Orangeman\r\n\"all out,\" was certainly at one time an Orange sympathiser. He and my\r\nmother often had political discussions, which usually ended in fierce\r\nquarrels, and when he would swear he would have us \"run out of the\r\nstreet,\" she used to threaten to bring up the men from the docks and\r\nleave not a stone upon a stone of his house. Whether it was through his\r\nbeing impressed by her terrible earnestness as a member of the Church\r\nmilitant, or whatever else was the reason, Jamieson in the end became a\r\nCatholic, and died a most edifying death.\r\n\r\nBefore his conversion, however, as well as after--Jamieson to the\r\ncontrary notwithstanding--\"our street\" always took a lively and\r\nneighbourly interest in the St. Patrick's procession, and used to turn\r\nout to a man, to a baby it would, perhaps, be more correct to say, for\r\nwas not one of the chief sights of the procession their decent\r\nneighbour, Timothy, or, as he was more generally called, \"Thade\"\r\nCrowley, the pork butcher, at the corner? There were splendid pictures\r\nand devices on the banners--I can see them all most vividly now--St.\r\nPatrick, Brian Bora, Sarsfield, O'Connell, the Irish Wolf Dog, with the\r\nmotto \"Gentle when stroked, fierce when provoked,\" and harps and\r\nshamrocks _galore_, but Thade Crowley was in all our eyes the finest\r\nfigure in the procession.\r\n\r\nAmong his greatest admirers were a Jewish family named Hyman, who lived\r\nnext door to him. Though the Jews are supposed to hold what was\r\nCrowley's stock-in-trade in abomination, the two old ladies--Mrs.\r\nCrowley, who used to say she was of \"Cork's own town and God's own\r\npeople,\" and Mrs. Hyman, who came from Cork, too, though, needless to\r\nsay, without a drop of Irish blood in her veins--were great cronies.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence, the Hymans were among the most eager of the spectators\r\nto get the first glimpse of honest Thade Crowley as he walked in front\r\nof his own particular lodge of the Hibernians. He was a portly,\r\nwell-built man, of ruddy complexion, and open, genial countenance. He\r\nwore buckskin breeches, top boots, green tabinet double-breasted\r\nwaistcoat, bottle-green coat with brass buttons, and beaver hat. The\r\nCrowleys were very popular in the neighbourhood, as they never had but a\r\nkindly word for everybody.\r\n\r\nWhen I was a small boy, about 9 or 10 years old, I often listened with\r\ndelight to Mrs. Crowley, who had a fluent tongue, expatiating on the\r\nglories of her native city--\r\n\r\n     By the pleasant waters of the River Lee.\r\n\r\nand I have heard her exclaiming, I at the time believing it most\r\nimplicitly:\r\n\r\n\"Sin, is it? Sure. I never heard of sin till I came to Liverpool;\r\nthere's no sin in Cor-r-k!\"\r\n\r\nAnd she rattled the \"r\" with a strong rising inflexion, greatly\r\nimpressing me with the high character of Ireland and of Cork in\r\nparticular.\r\n\r\nAt that time I had never seen Ireland but as an infant at my mother's\r\nbreast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nIRELAND RE-VISITED.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was a boy of about 12 when I first re-visited Ireland; and, as the\r\nsteamer entered Carlingford Lough, which to my mind almost equals\r\nKillarney's beauty--but that, perhaps, is a Northman's prejudice--with\r\nthe noble range of the Mourne mountains on the one side and the\r\nCarlingford Hills on the other, it seemed to my young imagination like a\r\nglimpse of fairy land.\r\n\r\nCarlingford reminded me of what my old masters, the Christian Brothers,\r\nused to teach us, that those places ending in \"ford\" had at one time\r\nbeen Norse settlements. There is not the slightest trace, I should say,\r\nof people of Norse descent along this coast now, unless we accept the\r\ntheory that would regard as such the descendants of the Norman De\r\nCourcy's followers, who can be recognised by their names, and are still\r\nto be found, side by side, and intermingling with those of the original\r\nCeltic children of the soil in the barony of Lecale. It is astonishing,\r\nby the way, how you still find in Ireland, after centuries of successive\r\nconfiscations, the old names in their old tribal lands, mingled in\r\nplaces, as in Lecale, with the Norman names; the two races being now\r\nthoroughly amalgamated--as distinguished from the case of King James's\r\nPlanters in Ulster, who, to this day are, as a rule, as distinct from\r\nthe population amongst whom they live--whether of pure Celtic strain or\r\nwith a Norman admixture--as when first they came.\r\n\r\nThere was an idea in our family that I had a vocation for the\r\npriesthood, and I was being sent to my uncle, Father Michael O'Loughlin,\r\nparish priest of Dromgoolan, County Down, who placed me in charge of Mr.\r\nJohnson, a somewhat noted classical teacher in the neighbouring little\r\ntown of Castlewellan.\r\n\r\nI have seen but little of Ireland, but during the few months I was here\r\non this occasion I made the best use of my time. I could have had no\r\nbetter guide and preceptor than \"Priest Mick,\" as my mother used to call\r\nmy uncle. I imagine that the term \"Priest,\" which, in the North of\r\nIreland, was formerly so much used as a prefix to the name of the\r\nCatholic clergyman, must have arisen amongst those not of his own flock,\r\nand was probably not intended to have exactly a respectful meaning.\r\n\r\nFather Michael sometimes came to see his relatives in Liverpool, who\r\nwere very numerous. He called them the \"Tribe of Brian\" (his father's\r\nname) and he made a point of visiting them all, down to the very latest\r\narrival--indeed, I think he was the only one who knew the whole of the\r\nramifications of \"the Tribe.\"\r\n\r\nHe used to say that his father--the aforesaid Brian--had one of the\r\nlargest noses in the country. There was only another man, he said, who\r\ncould approach him in that respect. If the two men met in a very narrow\r\n\"loanan \"--what they call a \"boreen\" in other parts of Ireland--the\r\nother man, who was a bit of a wag, would put his hand to his nose, and\r\nmake a motion of putting it aside, as if there was not sufficient room\r\nfor two such organs, and call out with a kind of snuffle: \"Pass, Brian!\"\r\n\r\nThe late Mgr. O'Laverty, in his \"History of the Dioceses of Down and\r\nConnor,\" says: \"From a government official survey in 1766 there were\r\nfifteen families in Castlewellan, of whom two only (Hagans and\r\nO'Donnells) were Catholics.\" Up to that date there must have been,\r\nduring this century, a considerable clearance of the Catholic population\r\nfrom the best land of this district, for I should say--judging from King\r\nJames's Army List and other authorities--that the Magennises (who, with\r\nthe MacCartans, were the chief territorial families of the old race in\r\nDown) still held land in the neighbourhood up to the end of the\r\nseventeenth century. As still further showing this, it will be found\r\nthat \"Eiver Magennis of Castlewellan\" was one of the members for the\r\nCounty Down in what Thomas Davis truly describes as \"The Patriot\r\nParliament\" of 1689.\r\n\r\nThe learned historian of Down and Connor gives an interesting account of\r\nthe only Norman colony of any extent in the province of Ulster. I have\r\nalready spoken of this. Notwithstanding the very small Norman\r\nadmixture, in the main the Catholics of the North are the most\r\npure-blooded Celts in Ireland. And even in the case of Lecale, the\r\noriginal Celtic population intermingled with the descendants of the\r\nNorman settlers, who, like the older native population have ever\r\nremained true to the old faith. The preponderance of the Celtic element\r\nin the Catholics of Ulster must be overwhelming. What is called\r\n\"Protestant Ulster\" is practically a foreign importation, which the\r\nnative population never absorbed, as they did the earlier invaders.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the Rev. Cornelius (or, as he was oftener called, Corney)\r\nDenvir, a relative of ours, who afterwards became Bishop of Down and\r\nConnor, Father O'Laverty says: \"The Denvirs are a Norman race, brought\r\nto Lecale by De Courcy. The late bishop observed the name in several of\r\nthe towns in Normandy.\"\r\n\r\nI only met Bishop Denvir once, when my father--who was his second\r\ncousin--took me to see him at the Grecian Hotel, Liverpool, when he was\r\non his way either to or from Rome. I once, when a small boy, incurred my\r\nfather's displeasure by criticising adversely (from what I had read in\r\nthe \"Nation\") Dr. Denvir's support of what was called the \"Bequest\r\nBill.\" There were some strictures in the \"Nation\" on the favour shown to\r\nthis Bill by three of the Irish Hierarchy, Archbishops Crolly and\r\nMurray, and Bishop Denvir. The last was a man of great learning. An\r\nedition of the Bible was published under his auspices by Sims and\r\nMcIntyre, of Belfast.\r\n\r\nDuring my stay in Ireland, I lived in the house of my uncle, Owen (or\r\nOiney, as he was commonly called) Bannon, in the townland of\r\nBallymagenaghy, where my mother was born.\r\n\r\nNo boy could have had a better object lesson in the part of Irish\r\nhistory embracing the Plantation of Ulster than Ballymagenaghy. It is\r\neminently typical of the kind of rocky and barren land to which the\r\nchildren of the soil were driven--land which would hardly bear\r\ncultivation. I need scarcely say that the people were \"Papishes\" to a\r\nman.\r\n\r\nThere was a hill behind my Uncle Oiney's house called Carraig\r\n(pronounced \"Corrig\"), in English \"rock,\" and the name might well apply\r\nto most of the townland, in which the chief productions seemed to be\r\nstones and rocks. Carraig was a kind of shoulder of what I heard the\r\npeople calling \"My lord's mountain.\" This was part of Lord Annesley's\r\ndomain, and separated from Carraig and several small farms by a wall,\r\nwhich ran down to a sheet of water at the foot--Castlewellan Lough. I,\r\nas a student of the \"Nation,\" was not at all satisfied that an Irish\r\nmountain should be called by such a name, which spoke volumes for the\r\nstate of serfdom into which the people had fallen. I was not long in\r\nfinding the real name--Sliab na Slat (mountain of Rods).\r\n\r\nI often looked with admiration at the view from its highest point.\r\nUnderneath, the side of the mountain was clothed with trees down to the\r\nedge of the lough, which mirrored the wooded eminences of exquisite\r\nbeauty surrounding it. Looking eastward you could see Dundrum Bay and\r\nthe white sails of the fishing boats.(They used to sing a mournful\r\nlament around the turf fires of Ballymagenaghy of \"The loss of the\r\nMourne Fishermen\" in a great storm off this coast). Further off you\r\nmight see an occasional large sailing vessel or steamer, and, further\r\nstill, in the dim distance, you could just discern the Isle of Man.\r\nSouthward the eye took in the noble range of the Mourne mountains,\r\nrunning from east to west, from where, at Newcastle, the Irish sea comes\r\nto kiss the foot of the lofty Slieve Donard, towering in majesty over\r\nall his fellows--rugged sentinels of the hills and vales of Down.\r\n\r\nLying, as if nestling under the Mourne range, was a small, well-wooded\r\nhill, part of the domain of Lord Roden, who held high rank among the\r\nOrange ascendancy faction, and, as will be seen later, may be said to\r\nhave held the lives and liberties of his Catholic fellow-countrymen in\r\nthis district in his hands.\r\n\r\nIn Ballymagenaghy I was oftener called by my mother's name than my\r\nfather's. In those days, as often as not, when a girl got married she\r\nwas still called by her friends by her maiden name. So, on the first\r\nSunday after my arrival, when I was taken over to Leitrim chapel, where\r\nI served my uncle's Mass, I found myself referred to as \"Peggy\r\nLoughlin's wee boy.\" It did not seem at all strange to me, for I\r\nscarcely ever heard her called by any other name. Indeed, some forty\r\nyears afterwards--when I was organising for the Irish National\r\nLeague--I met a County Down man in Cumberland. He was, as I soon found,\r\nfrom \"our own place,\" as they affectionately call it. He was trying to\r\ntrace out what family I belonged to. At last he had it--\"Oh\" he said,\r\n\"You would be a son of Margaret O'Loughlin?\" I hesitated for moment,\r\nwhen Edward McConvey, the local organiser--a County Down man, too--who\r\nhad introduced us, laughed heartily as he said: \"Here's a quare man;\r\ndoesn't know his own mother's name!\" In fact, I had so seldom heard my\r\nmother called anything else but \"Peggy\" that the proper name sounded\r\nstrange for the moment. Indeed, it had evidently taken our friend some\r\ntime to remember the name of \"Margaret,\" which he, no doubt, thought the\r\nmore polite one to use in speaking of my mother.\r\n\r\nHer family did not generally use the prefix \"O\" in her younger days. It\r\nwas only after her two brothers, Bernard and Michael, became priests,\r\nand always called and signed themselves \"O'Loughlin,\" that the prefix\r\nwas resumed. This is a common experience in other Irish families.\r\n\r\nMany of the small holdings in Ballymagenaghy would not support in\r\nanything approaching to comfort the large families with which the sturdy\r\nand industrious people were blessed. This was certainly the case with\r\nthe Bannons, but they were not entirely dependent on the land they\r\ntilled, as several of the family were employed in weaving in a portion\r\nof the house, the looms being their own. I have often admired the\r\nbeautiful damask table-cloths produced in the homes of these\r\n\"mountainy\" people, the webs, when finished, being taken to Banbridge,\r\nto the warehouses of the manufacturers, and the yarn and the patterns\r\nfor the next lot being brought back on the return journey.\r\n\r\nI believe that these cottage industries no longer exist, and that the\r\nbeautiful fabrics, for which our northern province is famous, are now\r\nproduced by steam power in Banbridge and other Ulster towns.\r\n\r\nAs the young men and boys of the Bannons worked at their looms, and the\r\nwomen and girls at their spinning and \"flowering,\" when not wanted to\r\nhelp on the land, the father, Oiney, would occasionally go over to\r\nEngland as a travelling packman, and so increase the family store. I\r\nhave known in late years other Ulstermen doing this--amongst others my\r\nold friend Bernard MacAnulty, of whom I shall have more to say later.\r\n\r\nI had often, at my home in Liverpool, heard of Irish hospitality. Here\r\nin Ballymagenaghy I had many practical illustrations of this in the way\r\nthey treated the \"poor man\" or \"poor woman\" as they called them--they\r\nnever called them beggars--who came to their doors. Indeed, it seemed\r\nto me that these had no occasion to _ask_ for help, for more than once I\r\nhave seen a \"poor woman\" coming in with her bed upon her back, putting\r\nit down in the warmest corner behind the chimney breast, and making\r\nherself at home as a matter of course, without going through the\r\nformality of asking for a night's lodging.\r\n\r\nOf the enormous number of harvestmen who passed every year through\r\nLiverpool, except from the County Donegal, there were not so many from\r\nthe northern province. The majority were from Connaught. They generally\r\nlanded at the Clarence Dock, Liverpool, a wiry, hardy-looking lot, with\r\nfrieze coats, corduroy breeches, clean white shirts with high collars,\r\nand blackthorn sticks. I have seen them filling the breadth of Prescot\r\nStreet, as they left the town, marching up like an army on foot to the\r\nvarious parts of England they were bound for. This was before special\r\ncheap trains were run for harvestmen.\r\n\r\nAt night, in my Irish mountain home, after I had prepared my Latin\r\nlessons for the following day, and my uncle, aunt, and cousins had left\r\noff work, I joined with great enjoyment in the family group around the\r\nturf fire, and listened with rapt attention to songs and stories; my\r\nfavourite among the latter being the adventures of Barney Henvey among\r\nthe fairies in the old rath, or \"forth,\" as they called it, of\r\nBallymagenaghy.\r\n\r\nI may say that, up to this moment, I have a certain liking for such\r\nstories--of course _as_ fairy stories. But, being a boy of enquiring\r\nmind, I wanted to get at the whole theory of the existence of these\r\nbeings, and, accordingly, this is what I gathered as to the origin,\r\npresent existence, and future state of the \"good people,\" as they called\r\nthem. In \"The Irish Fairy Legends,\" a number of my \"Penny Irish\r\nLibrary,\" I find I have dealt with the subject. As the passage gives the\r\nexplanation I got at my uncle Oiney's more correctly than I can trust\r\nto my memory to give it now, after a lapse of some sixty years, I may be\r\nexcused for giving the following extract:--\r\n\r\n     The belief is that, in the great rebellion of Lucifer, of the\r\n     spirits who fell from heaven, some, not so guilty as those who\r\n     \"went further and fared worse,\" fell upon our earth, and into the\r\n     air and water that surround it. These are the _Fairies_, who have\r\n     their various dispositions, like mortals, and like them, at the day\r\n     of judgment, will be rewarded or punished according to their\r\n     deserts.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Fairy Legends\" I have also given the story of \"Barney Henvey\"\r\nmentioned above. There is something like it in the \"Ingoldsby Legends,\"\r\nand, no doubt, in the fairy mythologies of other nations, but my story\r\nis of Irish origin. Heaven only knows through how many ages it has been\r\nhanded down to us. It is one of the fairy stories my mother and\r\ngrandmother used to tell us as long ago as I can remember. I have a\r\nlittle grandson who, when smaller, used sometimes to insist when put to\r\nbed after he had said his \"lying-down prayers,\" upon hearing \"Barney\r\nHenvey\" before he went to sleep; and so it will, no doubt, go on, and\r\nsuch stories may be told in ages to come, not only in Ireland--\"A Nation\r\nonce again\"--but in every settlement of the Clan-na-Gael throughout the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nFriends and neighbours would come to my uncle Oiney's from beside\r\nCastlewellan Lough, and over from Dolly's Brae and Ballymagrehan, who,\r\nafter the day's work, enjoyed going \"a cailey.\" I hope my Gaelic League\r\nfriends will forgive me if I don't give the correct sound of this word,\r\nbut that is my remembrance of how they pronounced it some sixty years\r\nago in the County Down.\r\n\r\nSometimes at our little gatherings, the \"wee boy from England,\" as the\r\nneighbours called me, would be asked to read from the \"Nation\" a speech\r\nof the Liberator--the title his countrymen gave O'Connell after Catholic\r\nemancipation. I was always delighted with this; entering as fully and\r\nenthusiastically into the spirit of what I read as any of the company.\r\n\r\nAs often as not, in Ballymagenaghy there would be sung, to the\r\naccompaniment of fiddle, flute or clarionet, one of those stirring songs\r\nwhich, week after week, appeared about this time in the \"Nation\" from\r\nthe pens of Thomas Davis, and the brilliant young men in O'Connell's\r\nmovement known as the \"Young Irelanders \"--songs \"racy of the soil,\"\r\nlike the \"Nation\" itself, which stirred the hearts of the Irish race\r\nlike the blast of a trumpet, songs which are still sung by Irish\r\nNationalists the world over.\r\n\r\nOn the Sundays, the Bannons and their next neighbours, the Finegans,\r\nMacCartans, and MacKays, with their fiddles, flutes, and clarionets,\r\nsupplied the chief part of the instrumental music of the choir--for\r\nthere was no organ--at the little mountain chapel at Leitrim, where my\r\nuncle, Father Michael, officiated. The happy remembrances of those\r\nSundays of my boyhood are always brought back to me whenever I read\r\nT.D. Sullivan's \"Dear Old Ireland,\" which is equally characteristic of\r\nthis corner of the \"black North\" as of the raciest part of Munster--more\r\nespecially where he sings:--\r\n\r\n  And happy and bright are the groups that pass\r\n    From their peaceful homes for miles,\r\n  O'er fields, and roads, and hills to Mass,\r\n    When Sunday morning smiles;\r\n      And deep the zeal their true hearts feel\r\n        When low they kneel and pray!\r\n          Oh, dear old Ireland!\r\n          Blest old Ireland!\r\n        Ireland, boys, hurrah!\r\n\r\nBut nothing excited my boyish enthusiasm more than the stories of the\r\nInsurrection of 1798. I was too young to understand much of what my\r\ngrandmother used to tell us about these times before she died. My mother\r\nwas born in 1799, and was the youngest daughter of her family, but her\r\neldest sister, my Aunt Mary, wife of Oiny Bannon, was 12 or 14 years old\r\nat the time of the Rising, and could describe more vividly what she saw\r\nconnected with it than I can now recall incidents in the Repeal and\r\nYoung Ireland Movements.\r\n\r\nListening to her, I could almost fancy I could see my grandfather, Brian\r\nO'Loughlin, leaving his home with the other Ballymagenaghy men, with\r\ntheir pikes and such guns as they could muster, to join the United Irish\r\nforces previous to the battles of Saintfield and Ballinahinch. At the\r\ntime of my visit to my mother's birthplace, my grandfather's house was\r\nin the occupation of the family of his youngest son, Edward, and, as a\r\npilgrim visiting a sacred spot, I have stood on its floor, as I\r\nafterwards did on the field of Ballinahinch itself.\r\n\r\nMy Aunt Mary used to speak of an incident which I have never read of in\r\nany account of the battle, but I am inclined to believe there was some\r\nfoundation for what she used to tell us. In one part of the engagement\r\nit seemed as if the bravery of the insurgents would have been crowned\r\nwith a victory as decisive as they had gained at Saintfield, when, by\r\nsome untoward circumstance, the fortunes of the day turned, and, in the\r\nend, the United Men were defeated. Perhaps what my Aunt Mary told me may\r\nbe some explanation of the turn in the tide of battle. She used to say\r\nthat when it looked as if the United Men were carrying all before them,\r\na portion of their forces called out for a \"Presbyterian ('Prispatairan'\r\nshe used to call it) Government,\" that this caused some hesitation among\r\nthe Catholics, that after this the battle went against them, and that\r\nthe day ended in disaster.\r\n\r\nThe story seems somewhat improbable, as it might be asked how, in the\r\nexcitement of a battle, men of one religion could be distinguished from\r\nthose of another? But this will not seem so unlikely if the\r\ncircumstances arising out of the Ulster Plantation of King James I. be\r\nremembered. As a consequence of this you will find townlands and\r\nparishes and whole districts, where the soil is poorest, where the\r\npeople are almost exclusively Catholic, and others where the\r\nnon-Catholic population are in an overwhelming majority. In the United\r\nforces the men of each locality would have been drilled and trained\r\ntogether, and, in the same way would, no doubt, act together on the\r\nfield of battle, so that, without any actual arrangement for that\r\npurpose, the Catholic or the Presbyterian would, most likely, find\r\nhimself among his own co-religionists.\r\n\r\nIt is wonderful how the memories of '98 were handed down from one\r\ngeneration to another, not only in Ireland, but wherever our people have\r\nmade their homes.\r\n\r\nThis has been brought home to me in the most forcible possible manner by\r\na circumstance which has come to my knowledge only a few months\r\nsince--so to speak--after a lapse of over a hundred years.\r\n\r\nThis is that General James William Denver--after whom, for his\r\ndistinguished career, the capital of the State of Colorado was called\r\nDenver City--had for his grandfather Patrick Denvir, who did a man's\r\nshare in the insurrection of '98, and, for his connection with it, had\r\nto fly from his native Down to America.\r\n\r\nThis information I had from General Denver's daughter, replying on\r\nbehalf of her brother, to whom I had written to find if the family were\r\nof Irish origin. I had some doubt about this, seeing that they spell\r\ntheir name with an \"e\" in the last syllable, whereas we and all of the\r\nname in the County Down use an \"i.\" The lady's letter was not only\r\ninteresting but most welcome, as showing that they were not only of\r\nIrish but of patriotic origin. They evidently continue to take an\r\ninterest in the land from which they have sprung, for the lady made\r\nsome enquiries about the late Bishop Denvir, of whom I have already\r\nspoken.\r\n\r\nMost of the United Irish leaders and a large proportion of the rank and\r\nfile in the '98 Rising were Presbyterians, and fought and bled for\r\nIreland with the same heroism as their Catholic neighbours, amongst whom\r\nno name is more cherished in the County Down than that of the Protestant\r\nGeneral Monroe, who, my Aunt Mary used to tell us, was hanged at his own\r\ndoor in 1798. How is it that the sons of the men of 1782 and of\r\nGrattan's Parliament, and of 1798 were not as good Irishmen as their\r\nfathers? I think I can give a kind of explanation.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that the era of Grattan's Parliament and of the\r\nVolunteer movement of 1782, of which present-day Nationalists are so\r\nproud, was also the era of the Penal laws. Since then the Protestants\r\nhave seen the Irish Catholic rising from the dust of serfdom and\r\nstanding in the attitude of manhood. They have seen him gradually\r\nobtaining a share in the making of the laws of the land, and, naturally,\r\nbecoming the predominant political power in Ireland--the Catholics being\r\nthe majority of the population. I may be wrong, but I have a theory that\r\nmany of the Protestants of Ireland--who once had all the political power\r\nin their hands, and did not always use it too mercifully in their\r\ntreatment of the rest of their countrymen--are afraid that if they\r\nassisted in getting self-government for Ireland the power in the hands\r\nof the enfranchised majority might be used against them.\r\n\r\nThat this is a groundless fear is shown from the fact that no men have\r\nbeen more honoured in Ireland than such Protestant leaders as William\r\nSmith O'Brien, Thomas Davis, John Mitchel, John Martin, Isaac Butt, and\r\nCharles Stewart Parnell. The same feeling is constantly shown at this\r\nmoment towards distinguished Protestants among the present Irish\r\nParliamentary Party.\r\n\r\nWhat has fostered the Anti-Irish feeling among Irish Protestants for the\r\nlast hundred years has undoubtedly been the fell system of Orangeism,\r\nwhich has caused so much hatred and bloodshed among men who, whatever\r\ntheir race or creed, are now children of the one common soil. The\r\nOrangeman looked upon himself as part of a foreign garrison, holding the\r\n\"Papishes\" in subjection. He was armed with deadly weapons;\r\nconsequently, the defenceless Catholic was almost entirely at his mercy,\r\nand the Orangeman was but too often backed up in his lawlessness by the\r\nlaw and its administrators.\r\n\r\nThis almost necessitated the existence, as a kind of defence against\r\nOrangeism, of a body I used to hear them speaking of when I was a boy in\r\nBallymagenaghy, called the \"Thrashers,\" which, I imagine, must have been\r\nsome kind of a secret society.\r\n\r\nIt must have been a sort of survival of these \"Thrashers\" that my\r\nfriend, Michael Davitt, many years afterwards, came across somewhere in\r\nthe North of England. The incident, as described by him, was both\r\namusing and saddening. He addressed them in his capacity as a Fenian\r\nOrganiser. After they had heard him patiently, an old man, the\r\nspokesman, said:\r\n\r\n\"Tell me--do you have Prodestans in this Society of yours?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" Davitt answered. \"We invite all Irishmen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we'll have nothing to do with yez!\"\r\n\r\nAs my Aunt Mary could relate thrilling stories of '98, so could my own\r\nmother tell me all about the savagery of Orangemen in her days. She used\r\nto describe to me the attempts of an Orange procession to pass through\r\nDolly's Brae, when she was a young girl, before she left Ireland.\r\nDolly's Brae is a kind of rugged defile through which passes the road\r\nfrom the town of Castlewellan, which, running westward, divides the\r\ntownlands of Ballymagenaghy and Ballymagrehan. It is an entirely\r\nCatholic district, and not at all on the ordinary route by which the\r\nprocessionists would reach their homes. Yet, in a spirit of aggression,\r\nand well-armed, as usual, with Orange banners waving, drums beating, and\r\nbands playing \"Croppies lie down,\" \"The Boyne Water,\" and similar airs,\r\nthis was the district they sought to march through.\r\n\r\nIt so happened that the proposed hostile parade was not altogether\r\nunexpected. In any case, their approach was heralded by the firing over\r\n\"Papish\" houses, as the processionists came towards Dolly's Brae. From\r\nthe heights above they were seen--my mother being one of the\r\nwatchers--in sufficient time to have the people of the immediate\r\nneighbourhood warned of the threatened Orange incursion.\r\n\r\nThe defenders of Dolly's Brae had no firearms, as their opponents had,\r\nbut they gathered up any weapons they could to repel the invaders. The\r\nOrangemen came on, expecting an easy victory. They had got well into the\r\ndefile, and were firing at their opponents, who were in sight before\r\nthem at some distance on the road, and into the houses on each side,\r\nwhen they were thrown into confusion by a storm of large stones and\r\npieces of rock hurled down the steep sides of the defile upon them by\r\nassailants who had been up till then invisible.\r\n\r\nAccording to the description of my mother, who was always a militant\r\nCatholic of the most orthodox description, and a strong physical force\r\nIrishwoman as well, the Dolly's Brae engagement must have borne some\r\nresemblance to the battle of Limerick, as described by Thomas Davis:--\r\n\r\n  \"The women fought before the men;\r\n  Each man became a match for ten;\r\n  So back they pushed the villains then\r\n    From the city of Luimneach Lionnglas\".\r\n\r\nShe ought to know, for she was in the thick of the fight. The confusion\r\nof the Orangemen was turned into a complete rout, and they fled, leaving\r\ntheir banners and other trophies in the hands of the mountainy men.\r\n\r\nFor many years the Orangemen never attempted to go near the place, but,\r\nwith the connivance and active aid of the guardians of the peace, they\r\ndid at last, many years afterwards, appear on the scene again. The\r\nOrange anniversary was celebrated at Tollymore Park, the seat of Lord\r\nRoden, who was a sort of Orange deity at the time. Tollymore Park is\r\nsome four or five miles south-east of Dolly's Brae, which is in the\r\nheart of the Catholic district, and, as I have said, far out of the\r\ndirect road of the Orangemen returning to their own homes.\r\n\r\nYet they deliberately took this route. They were a formidable body, well\r\narmed with guns. At their head was one Beers, the agent of Lord Roden,\r\nand a magistrate who, for the \"protection\" of the Orangemen, had under\r\nhis command a strong body of the constabulary and a detachment of\r\nsoldiers. The ordinary Englishman, who knows the police as they are in\r\nhis country as the guardians of the public peace, must not confound them\r\nwith those in Ireland. The Irish constabulary are simply the permanent\r\nBritish army of occupation, well armed and drilled, and, physically, as\r\nfine a body of men as any in the world. These were the forces under the\r\ncommand of Lord Roden's agent, for the invasion, for such it was, of a\r\npeaceful Catholic district.\r\n\r\nWhen the people sought to defend themselves from this invasion as best\r\nthey could, Beers, in his capacity as a magistrate, gave the police and\r\nsoldiers under his command the order to fire--which they did--upon the\r\npeople and into their houses. Consequently, what followed was nothing\r\nshort of a butchery, under cover of which the Orangemen wrecked the\r\nCatholic houses in the glen.\r\n\r\nI shall never forget the grief of my mother, at this time residing in\r\nLiverpool, at reading in the newspapers the names of the victims who\r\nhad been murdered outright or wounded. They were all her next door\r\nneighbours \"at home\"--people she had known from childhood.\r\n\r\nThe horrible outrage roused universal indignation. In Parliament the\r\nIrish members demanded a full official enquiry as to how this murderous\r\nbusiness came to be carried out by a Government official. As a result\r\nLord Roden and his agent were deprived of the Commission of the\r\nPeace--their offence was too glaring to be entirely overlooked. But to\r\nthe friends of those who had been legally murdered, and the innocent\r\npeople whose houses had been wrecked, this was a cruel mockery. Had the\r\ncriminals been Catholic peasants, they would have been put upon their\r\ntrial for their lives, and, at the very least, sent into penal\r\nservitude. What confidence could the Catholics of Ulster have in the\r\nadministration of the law, knowing, as they did, that even where they\r\nwere more than able to hold their own against the Orangemen, they were\r\nsure to be sufferers in the long run, seeing that their opponents would\r\nbe backed up by the forces that should go to preserve law and order.\r\n\r\nIt is thirty-five years since I last re-visited the County Down. I took\r\nmy son with me. He was nearly of the same age as I was myself when I\r\nlived in Ballymagenaghy, but I could only show him the site of Oiney\r\nBannon's house. It was not the too common case of an eviction, for the\r\nAnnesleys had the reputation of being tolerably good landlords. The\r\nland, as I have said, was very poor, in fact, if the people got it for\r\nnothing it would hardly repay cultivation. But it was picturesque, and\r\ntherefore Lord Annesley took some of it into his domain, and these\r\nbarren hills and rocks, when planted with trees, added to the beauty of\r\nthe scenery. The dispossessed tenants got land from him in Clarkhill,\r\nnot far off.\r\n\r\nSince that time, judging from the Irish newspapers, there seems to have\r\nbeen progress in the right direction, for the little town of\r\nCastlewellan, where for a short time I went to school, from being a\r\nplace where, in the Penal days, a Catholic was scarcely allowed to live,\r\nseems to have become a strong Nationalist centre for South Down. This\r\nwas my mother's part of the country. I have seen similar paragraphs\r\nwhich proved to me that, in the barony of Lecale, County Down, my\r\nfather's part, the people, though not so demonstrative as the \"mountainy\r\nmen,\" can still, as ever, be relied upon to stand as firm as Slieve\r\nDonard itself for creed and country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nO'CONNELL IN LIVERPOOL--TERENCE BELLEW MACMANUS AND THE REPEAL HALL--THE\r\nGREAT IRISH FAMINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nO'Connell, when passing through Liverpool on his way to Parliament,\r\nalways made the Adelphi Hotel his headquarters, and used to hear Mass\r\nnot far off at the Church of St. Nicholas, or, as it was more generally\r\ncalled, \"Copperas Hill Chapel,\" where I used to serve as an altar boy. I\r\nmust have been a very small boy at the time when I first remember the\r\nLiberator coming to Mass at our Church, for, on one occasion, on\r\nstretching up to the altar to remove the Missal it was so difficult for\r\nme to reach that I let it fall over my head.\r\n\r\nWithout being by any means what is termed a \"votheen,\" O'Connell was a\r\nfaithful and devout son of the Catholic Church. During the many years\r\nwhen he was passing through Liverpool, going to and returning from\r\nParliament, and on other occasions when he came to Irish gatherings in\r\nthe town, he attended Mass daily whenever possible, and frequently\r\napproached Holy Communion.\r\n\r\nO'Connell spoke several times from the balcony of the Adelphi Hotel.\r\nFrom my earliest days I was an earnest politician, and one of my most\r\ncherished remembrances is of having been brought by my father to one of\r\nthese gatherings. The Liberator addressed a great multitude, who filled\r\nthe whole square in front, and overflowed into the adjoining streets. My\r\nrecollection of him on this occasion is that of a big man, in a long\r\ncloak, wearing what appeared to me some kind of a cap with a gold band\r\non it. This must have been the famous \"Repeal Cap\" designed by the Irish\r\nsculptor, Hogan, who, when investing O'Connell with it at the great\r\ngathering at Mullaghmast, said: \"Sir, I only regret this cap is not of\r\ngold.\"\r\n\r\nAs in our later Irish movements, we frequently had meetings in one or\r\nother of the Liverpool theatres. O'Connell was, as often as his\r\nattendance could be secured, the central figure, and drew enormous\r\ngatherings. At one of these meetings at the Royal Amphitheatre there was\r\nan attempt by an armed body of Orangemen to storm the platform, on which\r\nwere all our leading Irishmen. Among the most active of these was\r\nTerence Bellew MacManus, who had all his lifetime been a devoted\r\nfollower and admirer of O'Connell. On this particular night, which was\r\nlong before the unfortunate split into \"Old Ireland\" and \"Young\r\nIreland,\" he had a fine opportunity of displaying his \"physical force\"\r\nproclivities in defence of the \"moral force\" leader.\r\n\r\nThe Orange attack was of short duration. They were simply cleared out as\r\nif by an irresistible whirlwind. We have always been able to hold our\r\nown in Liverpool, when it came to physical encounters against all\r\ncomers. We have generally had some organisation or another--whether\r\nconstitutional or unconstitutional--but, apart from this, the nature of\r\nthe employment of our working-men, especially in O'Connell's time,\r\nbrought them together in such a way that large numbers of them knew each\r\nother, and could act together in case of emergency.\r\n\r\nMacManus, who had command of the stewards on the night of the attack,\r\nknew a number of men like Mick Digney, who was what was called a\r\n\"lumper\"--that is, a contractor in a small way who took work in the\r\n\"lump\" and employed men for loading and unloading ships. Digney and\r\nother friends would find their way for consultation and the making of\r\nthe necessary arrangements beforehand on occasions like this to\r\nMacManus, whose place of business--he was an extensive forwarding\r\nagent--was one of those half-offices, half-warehouses, which used to be\r\nin North John Street.\r\n\r\nAnother class of men who were reliable for such occasions were the\r\nbricklayers' labourers. Of course, it is different now--and a sure sign\r\nthat our people are rising in the social scale--but in those years, and\r\nlong afterwards, I never knew a bricklayers' labourer who was not an\r\nIrishman.\r\n\r\nThe frequent mention at these gatherings of a sterling Irishman I knew\r\nwell in after years, Patrick O'Hanlon, reminds me of two friends of my\r\nfather of the same name who belonged to another class of men, the\r\nwood-sawyers, who, at that time, were mostly Irish. They had not\r\nexactly the same name as Patrick, for it was not so customary to use the\r\nO' or Mac in those days as it has since become. Not that Hughey and Ned\r\nHanlon did not know that they were entitled to the honourable Gaelic\r\nprefix, but, with the good nature which is rather too characteristic of\r\nIrishmen sometimes, those who had preceded them had allowed other people\r\nto drop the O' in using their name, until it became rather difficult to\r\nresume it.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say that Hughey and Ned Hanlon, John Green, Mike Doolan, and\r\nother wood-sawyers were at the Royal Amphitheatre among MacManus's\r\nvolunteers. The Hanlons, in particular, were fine lathy men, without an\r\nounce of spare flesh, but they had sinews of iron. Hughey used to come\r\nto our house with other neighbours every week to hear the \"Nation\" read,\r\nand the songs in it sung to the accompaniment of Harry Starkey's or my\r\nUncle John's fiddle. The Hanlons were North of Ireland men, and Hughey\r\noften used to proudly tell us that the O'Hanlons were the Ulster\r\nstandard-bearers.\r\n\r\nAt that time, besides the Amphitheatre, where during those years several\r\nIrish demonstrations were held, a popular place for our gatherings was\r\nthe Adelphi Theatre (previously the \"Queen's\"), which was in somewhat\r\nbetter standing then than afterwards, though it, too, has had within its\r\nwalls most of the Irish leaders of the last half century.\r\n\r\nI remember one occasion in particular when O'Connell was, of course, the\r\nhero of the day, which impressed itself upon my youthful mind the more\r\nforcibly on account of the presence on the platform of Jack Langan--of\r\nwhom I have already spoken--a warm-hearted and generous supporter of the\r\ngreat Dan, and the Cause of Repeal. Indeed, we boys regarded the Irish\r\nchampion boxer with the admiration we would have bestowed upon Finn\r\nMacCool or some other of the ancient Fenians, could they have appeared\r\nin bodily form amongst us.\r\n\r\nLittle we then thought that we should be welcoming on the same platform\r\nthe Fenians of our own days.\r\n\r\nThat meeting in the Adelphi has also been frequently brought back to my\r\nmind since, because for a long time the \"leading man\" in the stock\r\ncompany at that theatre was Edmond O'Rourke (stage name Falconer), a\r\nsterling Nationalist, with whom I made a closer acquaintance in later\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nI was often brought by my father to the weekly gatherings in the Repeal\r\nHall, Paradise Street, where, among the speakers on the Sunday nights I\r\ncan best remember were Terence Bellew MacManus, Patrick O'Hanlon, Dr.\r\nReynolds, George Smyth, and George Archdeacon.\r\n\r\nMacManus and Smyth (the latter of whom I knew well in after years),\r\nbesides being prominent workers in O'Connell's agitation for Repeal of\r\nthe Union between Ireland and Great Britain, took active parts in the\r\n\"Young Ireland\" movement. Dr. Reynolds was another of the Young\r\nIrelanders. So also was Archdeacon, who, in addition, still showed his\r\nbelief in physical force by his connection with Fenianism, for which he\r\nsuffered imprisonment.\r\n\r\nYoung as I was, I shall never forget the days of the Famine, for\r\nLiverpool, more than any other place outside of Ireland itself, felt its\r\nappalling effects. It was the main artery through which the flying\r\npeople poured to escape from what seemed a doomed land. Many thousands\r\ncould get no further, and the condition of the already overcrowded parts\r\nof the town in which our people lived became terrible, for the wretched\r\npeople brought with them the dreaded Famine Fever, and Liverpool became\r\na plague-stricken city. Never was heroism greater than was shown by the\r\ndevoted priests--English as well as Irish--in ministering to the sick\r\nand dying. So terrible was the mortality amongst them that several of\r\nthe churches lost their priests twice over. Our own family were nearly\r\nleft orphans, for both father and mother were stricken down by the\r\nfever, but happily recovered.\r\n\r\nIt will not be wondered at that one who saw these things, even though he\r\nwas only a boy, should feel it a duty stronger than life itself to\r\nreverse the system of misgovernment which was responsible.\r\n\r\nThere was, no doubt, a good deal of English sympathy for the\r\nfamine-stricken people, and there were some remedial measures by\r\nParliament--totally inadequate, however, but I am afraid that the\r\n\"Times\" and \"Punch,\" two great organs of public opinion, but too\r\nfaithfully represented the feelings of many of our rulers. The \"Times\"\r\nactually gloated over what appeared to be the impending extinction of\r\nour race. Young as I then was, but learning my weekly lessons from the\r\n\"Nation,\" I can remember how my blood boiled one day when I saw in a\r\nshop window a cartoon of \"Punch\"--a large potato, which was a caricature\r\nof O'Connell's head and face, with the title--\"The Real Potato Blight.\"\r\n\r\nAt the time of the Rising of 1848 I was commencing my apprenticeship\r\nwith a firm of builders, who were also my father's employers. They were\r\nsuccessors to the firm through whose agency he had been sent to Ireland\r\nas clerk of the works, just previous to my birth there. It was the\r\ncustom of the firm, when a boy came to commence his apprenticeship to be\r\na joiner, to keep him in the office for a time as office boy. I was\r\nemployed in the office at the time of the Rising, but one of the\r\npartners in this firm of builders, who was also an architect, seeing\r\nthat I had had a good education, and, through attending evening classes\r\nat the Catholic Institute and Liverpool Institute, had a considerable\r\nknowledge of mathematics and architectural drawing, gave me employment\r\nwhich was more profitable to the firm and congenial to me than that of\r\nan ordinary office boy or junior clerk. Besides helping in the ordinary\r\nclerical work in the office, I was put to copying and making tracings of\r\nground plans, elevations and sections of buildings, and working drawings\r\nfor the use of the artizans, besides assisting in surveying. I was about\r\nthree years employed in this way before entering into the joiners'\r\nworkshop. The firm was most anxious that I should remain in the office\r\naltogether, and I have often thought since that my father made a\r\nmistake in insisting that I should learn the trade of a joiner, which\r\nhe considered a more certain living than that of an architect or\r\ndraughtsman, unless one had influential connections.\r\n\r\nIt was from the upper window of the office where I was at the work I\r\nhave described that I could see the men belonging to our firm drilling\r\nas special constables in the school yard opposite, in anticipation of\r\ntrouble in connection with an Irish Rising.\r\n\r\nThe authorities were evidently preparing for a formidable outbreak in\r\nLiverpool, for there was a large military camp at Everton--a suburb of\r\nthe city--and three gunboats in the river ready for action, in case any\r\npart of the town fell into the hands of the Irish Confederates. Special\r\nconstables, as in the case of our own firm, were being sworn in all over\r\nthe town, and the larger firms were putting pressure upon their\r\nemployees to be enrolled. Indeed, some 500 dock labourers were\r\ndischarged because they would not be sworn in. My father declined to be\r\na special constable, but suffered no further from this than becoming a\r\nsuspect--his services being too valuable to be dispensed with by his\r\nemployers.\r\n\r\nHe was a genuinely patriotic Irishman, steadfast in his political creed,\r\nthough unostentatious in his professions, being more a man of action\r\nthan of words. My mother, as I think I have already sufficiently\r\nindicated, was, on the other hand, more demonstrative. I think she must\r\nhave had a positive genius for conspiracy. Whatever the movement was she\r\nmust have a hand in it. On one occasion--I forget exactly what it\r\nwas--some compromising documents had to be got out of the way for the\r\ntime being. In those days sloops used to come over from Ireland with\r\npotatoes, and the cargoes used to be sold on the quay at the King's\r\nDock. She often bought a load of potatoes here to supply a small general\r\nshop which she kept to help out my father's earnings. It was under such\r\na load of potatoes that she had brought home that she concealed the\r\ndangerous documents.\r\n\r\nIt was in June, 1848, in the columns of the \"Nation\" that I first met\r\nwith the name of Bernard MacAnulty. In after years I worked in\r\nsuccessive national movements with him, and ever found him a dear friend\r\nand most active and enthusiastic colleague. As showing that he was a man\r\nof advanced proclivities, I may mention that he wrote to the \"Nation\"\r\nsuggesting the formation of the \"Felon Repeal Club\" in\r\nNewcastle-on-Tyne. From then up to the last day of his life he was the\r\nsame generous whole-souled Irishman he had been from the beginning. His\r\nstalwart frame and pleasant, genial face were well known during the\r\nwhole of the Home Rule movement, in which I was thrown into frequent\r\ncontact with him, when we were both members of the Executive of the Home\r\nRule Confederation of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nHe was a North man, from the County Down, a successful merchant--having\r\nstarted life as a packman--in Newcastle-on-Tyne, and so won the respect\r\nof all classes that he was elected a member of the Town Council, in\r\nwhich he served with great credit. The northern Catholic, who is so\r\noften a pure Celt, is sometimes credited with having acquired some of\r\nthe qualities of his Presbyterian neighbours of Lowland Scots\r\nextraction. But this is only on the surface, and Bernard MacAnulty was a\r\ntypical example of this. No braver or more generous Irishman ever\r\nbreathed, and he had a fund of humour which would have done credit to\r\nthe quickest-witted Connaughtman or Munsterman that ever lived. Though\r\nthe Ulster accent is generally regarded as a hard one, I never thought\r\nit was so with my friend. Perhaps this is owing to my partiality as a\r\nCounty Down man, which, though born in Antrim, I always consider myself,\r\nDown being the native place of my people from time immemorial. I have\r\nalways thought that the people born and reared, as Bernard was, among\r\nthe Mourne Mountains and their surroundings have anything but an\r\nunmusical accent.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the Fenian movement my dear old friend was a strong,\r\nactive, and generous sympathiser. His purse was always available for\r\nevery good National object, whether \"legal\" or \"illegal,\" and I know as\r\na fact that many a good fellow \"on the run\" found shelter under his\r\nroof, and never went away empty-handed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE \"NO-POPERY\" MANIA--THE TENANT LEAGUE--THE CURRAGH CAMP.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe restoration of the Catholic Hierarchy, September 29th, 1850, brought\r\non what appeared to us one of John Bull's periodical fits of lunacy. I\r\nwitnessed many scenes of mob violence at the time, when, in deference to\r\nthe prevailing bigotry in opposing what they termed \"Papal Aggression\" a\r\npart of the Penal Laws were revived in Lord John Russell's\r\nEcclesiastical Titles Act. In due course John got over his paroxysm, and\r\nthe Act was repealed.\r\n\r\nBut for a time the storm of bigotry raged fiercely, and, as the\r\nfollowing incident will show, while the mania lasted even the police\r\nwere not entirely free from it.\r\n\r\nThe site of the noble Gothic edifice, Holy Cross Church, Great Crosshall\r\nStreet, Liverpool, was, at this time, occupied by a ramshackle place\r\nmade into a temporary chapel out of a number of old houses. It was so\r\nconstructed that from any part you could see the altar, if you could not\r\nalways hear Mass.\r\n\r\nThis was not, however, an unusual thing in Liverpool in the old days,\r\nparticularly in the Famine years, when our panic-stricken people came\r\ninto Liverpool like the wreck of a routed army.\r\n\r\nThe chief feature of the old Holy Cross Chapel was a long narrow flight\r\nof stairs, leading from Standish Street, the side street off Great\r\nCrosshall Street, up to a higher part of the building which served the\r\npurpose of a gallery.\r\n\r\nThe famous Dr. Cahill came to Holy Cross to preach, and every part of\r\nthe building was crowded to suffocation. In the middle of the sermon an\r\nalarm was raised of a broken beam or something of the kind, and the\r\npeople commenced to rush down the narrow stairs in a state of panic.\r\n\r\nSuch of them as could crush their way out, instead of being assisted,\r\nwere set upon and assaulted with their batons by several policemen, who\r\nwere in the street outside. So great was the indignation in the town,\r\nthat a public inquiry was held, and it was proved that the police not\r\nonly brutally struck men, women and children, but even a blind man who\r\nwas trying to grope his way out. They also used foul expressions about\r\n\"Popery\" and the \"bloody Papists,\" and it was afterwards proved that\r\nthese very men had themselves raised the alarm, apparently to get an\r\nexcuse for breaking the heads of the unfortunate people. An honest\r\npolice official, whose duty it afterwards became to make a report of\r\nwhat had occurred, came upon the scene, and did what he could to stop\r\nthe brutality.\r\n\r\nWhen Dowling, the head constable, came to the police office next\r\nmorning, and saw the official report in the book kept for the purpose,\r\nhe caused the leaf containing it to be torn out, and another report by\r\none Sergeant Tomlinson to be substituted for it. Mr. Mansfield, the\r\nstipendiary magistrate, who conducted the inquiry, denounced Dowling and\r\nTomlinson for what he called \"the disgraceful and discreditable\r\nsuppression of the report which,\" he added, \"was no doubt true. He had\r\nnever heard of more disgraceful proceedings in his life.\"\r\n\r\nPending a fuller investigation, the police office books were impounded,\r\nand, as a result of the inquiry, several of the police were suspended.\r\nDowling was dismissed from his post as head constable of Liverpool, and\r\nlost a retiring pension which, if all had been well with him, he would\r\nhave come in for a short time afterwards.\r\n\r\nAn amusing story is told of a Liverpool daily paper in those days. It\r\nwas struggling with adversity, and the manager, a worthy Scotsman, sat\r\nin his office on Monday morning with the weekly statement before him,\r\nshowing increasing expense and decreasing revenue.\r\n\r\nTo him entered a Liverpool parson--very determined and very menacing. He\r\nhad asked for the editor, but that gentleman had not yet come down, and\r\nthe manager was the only person in authority visible, so he had to make\r\nshift with him.\r\n\r\n\"I am here,\" the parson said, \"as the mouthpiece of a large number of\r\npeople who are not satisfied with the attitude of the 'Liverpool ----'\r\non the great question of the hour--Whether Popery is to dominate our\r\nliberties or are we to crush Popery?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the manager, wearily, his mind still on the balance sheet.\r\n\"What do you complain of?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish to tell you, sir,\" said the parson, with impressive emphasis,\r\n\"that only this morning I have heard the belief expressed by merchants\r\non 'Change that the 'Liverpool ----' is actually in the pay of the Pope\r\nof Rome!\"\r\n\r\nIn a second a ray of light seemed to irradiate the gloom of the\r\nmanager's soul, as he contemplated in a flash of thought the untold\r\ntreasures of the Vatican--\r\n\r\n\"Man!\" he exclaimed fervently, \"I wish to Heaven it was!\"\r\n\r\nBut the numerous exhibitions of bigotry stirred up in connection with\r\nLord John Russell's Ecclesiastical Titles Act were of trifling\r\nconsequence compared with the injury done to the Irish people arising\r\nout of the same Act. For it led to the ruin of the Tenant Right\r\nagitation in Ireland, in which the Irish people, Protestant as well as\r\nCatholic, had been united as they had not been since 1798 and the days\r\nof Grattan's Parliament.\r\n\r\nFor the Tenant League and the Irish Party in Parliament had in their\r\nranks some of the greatest rascals who had ever disgraced Irish\r\npolitics. These, while posing as the champions of Catholicity in\r\nopposing Lord John Russell's bill, were simply working for their own\r\nbase ends, and were afterwards known and execrated as the Sadlier-Keogh\r\ngang.\r\n\r\nTheir infamous betrayal of the Irish tenantry dashed the hopes and\r\ndestroyed the union of North and South from which so much was expected,\r\nbesides creating a distrust in constitutional agitation which lasted for\r\nnearly a generation.\r\n\r\nThe after fate of the Sadlier-Keogh gang--including the suicide of John\r\nSadlier and the scarcely less wretched end of Keogh--have ever since\r\nbeen terrible object-lessons to the Irish people.\r\n\r\nIn his later years I enjoyed the friendship of one of the most\r\ndistinguished of the Tenant Right leaders, who had also played a\r\nprominent and honourable part in the Repeal and Young Ireland movements.\r\nThis was Charles Gavan Duffy, whom I met after his return from\r\nAustralia.\r\n\r\nIt was the Sadlier-Keogh treason, their selling themselves to the\r\nGovernment after the most solemn promises to the contrary, and the way\r\nin which their conduct had been condoned by so many of the hierarchy,\r\nclergy and people of Ireland, that caused Gavan Duffy to lose heart for\r\nthe time, and to declare, as he left the country, in memorable\r\nwords--\"that there was no more hope for Ireland than for a corpse on the\r\ndissecting table.\"\r\n\r\nBut, as I learned from his own lips on his return to this country, he\r\nnever lost sight of the National movement while in Australia, where he\r\nbecame first Minister of the Crown in a self-governing colony; and, on\r\nhis return, his old hope for the success of our Cause had, he assured\r\nme, revived.\r\n\r\nCharles Gavan Duffy having sailed for Australia on the 6th of November,\r\n1855, John Cashel Hoey succeeded him as editor of the \"Nation,\" he\r\nhaving, as one of his colleagues, Alexander Martin Sullivan, who\r\nafterwards became sole proprietor and responsible editor.\r\n\r\n\"A.M.\" Sullivan, as he was always called, was an upright man, who had a\r\nvery clear conception of his own policy in Irish matters. He frankly\r\naccepted the British constitution, and worked inside those lines. To me,\r\nwhen my country was concerned, the British constitution (with the making\r\nof which neither I nor my people had ever had anything to do) was a\r\nmatter of very little moment. Any work for Ireland that commended itself\r\nto my conscience and was practicable was good enough. Nevertheless, it\r\nwill ever be to me a source of pride that, from the moment when we first\r\nknew each other to the hour of his death, we were the closest friends.\r\n\r\nIn connexion with the \"Papal aggression\" mania, Cardinal Wiseman was the\r\ncentral figure against whom the storm of bigotry was chiefly directed. I\r\nremember with pleasure that I took part in the reception given to him in\r\nLiverpool by Father Nugent and the students of the Liverpool Catholic\r\nInstitute, by whom the Cardinal's fine play of \"The Hidden Gem\" was\r\nperformed in the Hall of the Institute during his stay in town. The\r\nbringing of the Cardinal to Liverpool was only one of the many occasions\r\nwhen the good Father was the medium through whom, from time to time, a\r\nnumber of distinguished Catholics and Irishmen were brought into\r\nintimate contact with their co-religionists and fellow-countrymen in the\r\ntown for the advancement of some worthy object connected with creed or\r\nnationality--most frequently with both.\r\n\r\nI have described the St. Patrick's Day annual processions in Liverpool.\r\nNotwithstanding some grand features in connection with them, they were,\r\nunfortunately, sometimes the occasion of rioting and intemperance.\r\nFather Nugent was of Irish parentage and sympathies, and possessed of\r\ngreat zeal, capacity, energy and eloquence. He determined to make a new\r\ndeparture in celebrating the national anniversary, for though the\r\nprocessions were magnificent displays, and it was not the fault of their\r\npromoters if ever there was any scandal arising out of them, still there\r\nwas much that was inconsistent with a worthy celebration of the feast of\r\nthe national saint of Ireland. Calling a number of young Irishmen\r\ntogether, of whom I was one, he, with their help, organised on a grand\r\nscale a festival which was held in one of the large public halls of the\r\ntown. So successful was the first of these that they became an annual\r\ninstitution, which superseded the previous out-door celebrations.\r\n\r\nOn these occasions there were selections of Irish music and song, and\r\noratory from some distinguished Irishman, with an eloquent and stirring\r\npanegyric on St. Patrick from Father Nugent himself, making a more\r\ncreditable and enjoyable celebration of the national festival than had\r\never been held in the town before.\r\n\r\nSuch celebrations as these (which have for many years past been held\r\nunder the auspices of the Irish national political organisation of the\r\nday), have become common in the Irish centres of Great Britain. Indeed,\r\nit has become one of the recognised duties of the members of the Irish\r\nParliamentary Party to hold themselves in readiness to be drafted off to\r\none or another of these gatherings, which are the means of keeping\r\nsteadily burning the fire of patriotism in the breasts of our people.\r\nAnd what is of consequence from a financial point of view, the proceeds\r\nof these gatherings help to provide the sinews of war for carrying on\r\nthe Home Rule campaign in Great Britain. For over half a century, from\r\nthe time when I assisted Father Nugent with his first celebration, I\r\ntook an active part in organising these gatherings in many places.\r\n\r\nI said at the commencement that I knew little of Ireland from personal\r\ncontact with it. Born there, I was too young to remember being brought\r\nto England. For some months I was there again, as I have already\r\nmentioned, as a boy of twelve, under the care of my uncle, the Rev.\r\nMichael O'Loughlin. I had often desired to see more of Ireland, and,\r\nsingularly enough, it was the Crimean War that gave me the opportunity\r\nof spending another three months there in the summer of 1855.\r\n\r\nA large firm in Liverpool had part of the contract for erecting the\r\nwooden houses and other buildings at the camp being erected on the\r\nCurragh of Kildare at the time of the war. I made application, and, with\r\nmy brother Bernard, was employed to go there. Reaching the Curragh, we\r\nfound that many of the men slept in the huts they were erecting, being\r\nsupplied by the contractors with the requisite bed and bedding. The\r\ncontractors also erected a large \"canteen,\" to be used afterwards by the\r\nmilitary where the workmen could be supplied with food and drink--too\r\nmuch drink sometimes. These arrangements for food and sleeping were\r\nsomewhat necessary, as the nearest towns, Kildare, Kilcullen, and\r\nNewbridge were each some three miles off.\r\n\r\nBut we were anxious to see as much of the country and of the people as\r\nwe could, and, besides, did not care for the mixed company sleeping in\r\nthe huts. We therefore managed to secure lodgings with the Widow Walsh,\r\non the road leading from the Curragh to Suncroft. The widow's husband\r\nhad but recently died, leaving her a pretty good farm, and, with the aid\r\nof her family--one of them a fine, grown-up young man--she was able to\r\nhold on to the land. But the ready cash she got from the Curragh men who\r\ncame to lodge with her was useful too. It was a good big house of the\r\nkind, and the widow made use of every available inch of it, so that she\r\nhad about a dozen of us in all. Mrs. Walsh, though an easy-going soul\r\nherself, had a fine bouncing girl to help her, but, with a dozen hungry\r\nmen coming with a rush at night, it used to be a scramble for the\r\ncooking utensils, as we were largely left to our own devices. We used to\r\nleave early in the morning for our work on the Curragh, taking with us\r\nthe materials for our breakfasts and dinners. As to the cooking, some\r\nwent to the canteen, while others got their meals wherever they happened\r\nto be working. As there were plenty of chips and small cuttings of wood,\r\nonly fit for that purpose, we used to make of these big fires on the\r\nshort grass, and we boiled our water for tea or coffee and our eggs, and\r\nfrizzled our chops or bacon at the end of a long stick.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned before that whenever one finds work particularly\r\nlaborious he is fairly certain to find Irishmen at it. It was so at the\r\nCurragh. When a carpenter or joiner lays down the boarding of a floor,\r\nif there is only a small quantity of it he planes it down himself to\r\nmake an even surface. But if there is a large quantity this does not\r\npay, and the contractor brings in another artist called a \"flogger,\"\r\nwho, in nine cases out of ten, in my time, was an Irishman. It was\r\ngenerally given out as \"piece work\" to one man, the \"master-flogger,\" as\r\nyou might term him, who employed the others. One of these, a very decent\r\nIrishman, Tom Cassidy, whom I had known in Liverpool, had the contract\r\nfor the work at the Curragh Camp, and he had about a score of his\r\nfellow-countrymen working for him.\r\n\r\nGoing back to Liverpool for a holiday, while my brother and I were still\r\nat the Curragh, honest Tom called on my father and mother, who knew him\r\nwell. They were glad to hear that he was lodging at the Widow Walsh's,\r\nand could tell them all about their boys. This he could do most\r\ntruthfully without letting his imagination run away with him. \"Aye,\r\nindeed,\" he said, \"Barney and John are lodging in the one house with me,\r\nwith a decent widow woman, and many a glass we had together at Igoe's.\"\r\nTom had put in this bit of \"local colouring\" about Igoe's to show the\r\ngood fellowship between us, but as their sons were both teetotalers,\r\nthe old people knew that this could not be true, and the rest of his\r\nstory was somewhat discredited in consequence.\r\n\r\nIgoe's was a public house just on the corner of the road leading from\r\nthe Curragh to Suncroft. What between the workmen at the Camp and the\r\nsoldiers and the militia, Igoe's must have been doing a roaring trade at\r\nthis time. Which reminds me that I one day saw John O'Connell (son of\r\nthe Liberator), then a captain in the Dublin militia, trying to get a\r\nlot of his men, who were the worse for liquor, out of Igoe's. It could\r\nnot be said that he did not give an edifying example to his men, for I\r\nsaw him, on another occasion, going to Holy Communion, at the Soldiers'\r\nMass, where the altar was fixed up under a verandah in the officers'\r\nquarter, the men being assembled in the open square in front. He was a\r\nwell-meaning man, and tried to carry on the Repeal Association after his\r\nfather's death, but it soon collapsed, for the mantle of Dan was\r\naltogether too big for John.\r\n\r\nAlthough he generally showed himself bitterly opposed to the Young\r\nIrelanders, he was a poetical contributor to the \"Nation,\" where I find\r\nhim represented by two very fine pieces--\"Was it a Dream?\" and \"What's\r\nmy Thought Like?\" In the latter piece he pictures Ireland--\r\n\r\n  No longer slave to England! but her sister if she will--\r\n  Prompt to give friendly aid at need, and to forget all ill!\r\n  But holding high her head, and, with serenest brow,\r\n  Claiming, amid earth's nations all, her fitting station now.\r\n\r\nI never met his brother Maurice, but I could imagine his a more\r\ncongenial spirit with the \"Young Irelanders\" than any other of the\r\nO'Connell family. He, too, is represented in \"The Spirit of the Nation\"\r\nby his rousing \"Recruiting Song of the Irish Brigade\" which, sung to the\r\nair of \"The White Cockade,\" has always been a favourite of mine.\r\n\r\nA fine, genial old priest, full of gossip and old-time stories, was\r\nFather MacMahon, of Suncroft. If he met one of us on the road he would\r\nstop to have a gossip, and was always delighted when he found, as he\r\noften did, along with an English tongue an Irish heart. From him it was\r\nI heard the legend of St. Brigid's miraculous mantle and the origin of\r\nthe Curragh--how the saint, to get \"as much land as would graze a poor\r\nman's cow\" made the very modest request from the king for as much ground\r\nas her mantle would cover; how he agreed, and she laid her mantle down\r\non the \"short grass;\" how, to the king's astonishment, it spread and\r\nspread, until it covered the whole of the ground of what is now the\r\nCurragh; and how it would have spread over all Ireland but that it met\r\nwith a red-haired woman, and that, as everybody knows, is unlucky.\r\nWhenever, in our rambles along the country roads we afterwards met a\r\nred-haired woman, we used to wonder was she a descendant of the female\r\nwho stopped the growth of the Curragh of Kildare.\r\n\r\nFather MacMahon could also tell us of the gallant fight made by the men\r\nof Kildare, and the massacre of the unarmed people on the Curragh in\r\n1798. Many of the men from the Curragh used to come to Mass on Sundays\r\nat Suncroft, and often in his sermons--which were none the less edifying\r\nbecause they were given in the same free and easy style as his gossips\r\nwith us on the road--he would tell his people of the talks he had had\r\nwith the men from the Camp, and what good Irishmen he found among them.\r\nThey, in their turn, were very fond of the good father, and most of them\r\ntook a practical way of showing their feeling when it came to the\r\noffertory.\r\n\r\nDear old Father MacMahon! I took up an Irish Church Directory the other\r\nday and looked for the little village of Suncroft, in the dioceses of\r\nKildare and Leighlin, to see if your name was still there, foolishly\r\nforgetting that it is over fifty years since we met--you an old man and\r\nI a young one. I am an old man now, and you--you dear good old\r\nsoul--must have gone to your reward long ago, where you in your turn\r\nwill be hearing from St. Brigid herself, and from the fine old Irish\r\nking who gave the Curragh, the true story of the miraculous mantle; and\r\nhow the king did not make such a bad bargain after all, for, in exchange\r\nfor his gift, he now, doubtless, has what St. Brigid promised, a kingdom\r\nfar greater than even her mantle would cover--the Kingdom of Heaven.\r\n\r\nOn Sundays we used to have long walks. We did not often go near\r\nNewbridge--it was too much like an ordinary English military station. We\r\npreferred going to Kildare, where stands the first Irish Round Tower I\r\never saw, and where the fine old ruined church of St. Brigid put us in\r\nmind of the patron saint of Ireland; or to Kilcullen, where the brave\r\nKildare pikemen routed General Dundas in 1798; and to others of the\r\nneighbouring places. We reviewed, too, every part of the famous Curragh\r\nitself, so full of memories--glorious and sad--of Irish history.\r\n\r\nAs fast as we finished them, the huts we were building were occupied by\r\nthe military, and, whether regulars or militia, I found among them,\r\ndriven to wear the uniform by stress of circumstances, as good Irishmen\r\nas I ever met. Coming home from work one evening, I met on the road to\r\nthe Curragh a party of them, carrying, for want of a better banner, a\r\nbig green bush, and singing \"The Green Flag.\" Then, as they came in\r\nsight of the famous plain itself, a man struck up:--\r\n\r\n  Where will they have their camp?\r\n                 Says the _Shan Van Voct_\r\n\r\nWhen, as if moved by one impulse, all joined in:--\r\n\r\n  On the Curragh of Kildare,\r\n  And the boys will all be there,\r\n  With their pikes in good repair--\r\n                 Says the _Shan Van Voct_!\r\n\r\n\"Igoe's porter!\" a cynic might say. True, there may have been a glass or\r\ntwo and a little harmless rejoicing, but this was too spontaneous to be\r\nanything but the outpouring of the good, honest warm hearts of the poor\r\nfellows, burning with love for the land that bore them.\r\n\r\nPeter Maughan, who, like myself, was a house joiner, working at the\r\nCurragh, had similar experiences. Indeed, you might say that he was then\r\nqualifying himself for the part he very efficiently filled some years\r\nlater in the Irish Revolutionary Brotherhood, as recruiting officer\r\namong the soldiery of Britain. Of course, he found scoundrels amongst\r\nthem too, for, as the history of the Fenian movement shows, he was\r\nhimself betrayed and sent to penal servitude.\r\n\r\nBefore I returned to England I had a most interesting tour through the\r\nSouth of Ireland, that being, I may say, the most I have ever actually\r\nseen of my own country. Having a taste for drawing, I took sketches of\r\nthe various noted places I visited, which I preserved for many\r\nyears--the most cherished remembrances of my visit to the \"old sod.\"\r\n\r\nAfter returning from the Curragh to Liverpool, I married there and\r\ncarried on business on my own account for several years as a joiner and\r\nbuilder, before taking service with Father Nugent, first as secretary of\r\nhis Boy's Refuge, and then as conductor for some three years of his\r\nnewspaper, the \"Northern Press and Catholic Times.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE IRISH REVOLUTIONARY BROTHERHOOD--ESCAPE OF JAMES STEPHENS--PROJECTED\r\nRAID ON CHESTER CASTLE--CORYDON THE INFORMER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trials in 1859, following the arrests in connection with the Phoenix\r\nmovement, with which the name of Jeremiah O'Donovan (called also\r\n\"Rossa,\" after his native place) was identified, were the first public\r\nmanifestations of what developed into the great organisation known in\r\nAmerica as the Fenian Brotherhood, and, on this side of the Atlantic as\r\nthe I.R.B., or Irish Revolutionary Brotherhood.\r\n\r\nMany years afterwards \"Rossa\" called at the office of the Irish National\r\nLeague in London, to see his old fellow-conspirator, James Francis\r\nXavier O'Brien, then General Secretary of the constitutional\r\norganisation for the attainment of \"Home Rule.\" As I was chief organiser\r\nfor the League in Great Britain, and was in the, office at the time, I\r\nwas introduced to his old comrade (who had, he said, often heard of me)\r\nby \"J.F.X.,\" as we used to call him, and it was to me a delightful\r\nexperience to hear the two old warriors, who had done and suffered so\r\nmuch for Ireland, fighting their battles over again.\r\n\r\nI was sitting in my office in Father Nugent's Refuge one day, about the\r\nbeginning of 1866, when my old friend, John Ryan, was shown in to me.\r\n\r\nAs we had not seen each other for several years, our greeting was a most\r\ncordial one. Though we had not met, I had heard of him from mutual\r\nfriends from time to time as being actively connected with the physical\r\nforce movement for the freedom of Ireland.\r\n\r\nDuring this time I had often wished to see him, and I found that exactly\r\nthe same idea had been in _his_ mind regarding me; our object being the\r\nsame--my initiation into the ranks of the Irish Revolutionary\r\nBrotherhood, of which he was an organiser.\r\n\r\nA word perhaps is due here--for I wish to pay respect to the opinion of\r\nevery man--to those Irishmen who call themselves loyalists. On close\r\nanalysis their language and arguments appear to me to be meaningless. A\r\nstudy of the history of the world and of the origins of civil power show\r\nthat there is only one thing that is recognisable as giving a good and\r\nstable title to any government, and that is the consent of the governed.\r\n\r\nA man who is a member of a community owes a duty to the community in\r\nreturn for the benefit arising out of his membership, but his\r\nduty--which he may call loyalty if he pleases--is proportionate to the\r\nshare which he possesses in the imposition of responsibilities upon\r\nhimself. The application of this to Ireland is obvious, and it explains\r\nwhy in so many cases a man who has been a rebel in Ireland has\r\nafterwards risen to the highest place in the self-governing communities\r\nwhich are called British colonies. To put it in another way, a community\r\nof intelligent men must be self-governing, or else it will be a\r\nforcing-house for rebels. I don't see any third way.\r\n\r\nAs I have before suggested, the two questions that have always presented\r\nthemselves to me in connection with work for Ireland have been--first,\r\nis it right? Second, is it practicable? In joining the I.R.B. I had no\r\ndoubt on either ground. As to the first, the misgovernment of Ireland,\r\nof which I had seen the hideous fruits in the Famine years and\r\nemigration, was ample justification. As to the second, there was every\r\nlikelihood of the success of the movement. It will be remembered that\r\nduring these years the great Civil War in America was going on, in which\r\nmany thousands of our fellow-countrymen, were engaged on both sides,\r\nmostly, however, for the North. A great number of these had entered into\r\nthis service chiefly with the object of acquiring the military training\r\nintended to be used in fighting on Irish soil for their country's\r\nfreedom. Such an opportunity seemed likely to arise, for during this\r\ntime the \"Alabama Claims\" and other matters brought America and England\r\nto the verge of war. Had such a conflict arisen, one result of it, as\r\nMr. Gladstone and other British statesmen could not but have foreseen,\r\nwould probably be the severance of the connexion, once for all, between\r\nIreland and Great Britain.\r\n\r\nJohn Ryan, knowing me so well, felt tolerably assured that no argument\r\nfrom him would be required to induce me to join the I.R.B.;\r\nconsequently, one of the first things he did was, at my request, to\r\nadminister to me the oath of allegiance to the Irish Republic, as the\r\nsaying went, \"now virtually established.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this we had a long _seanchus_, I telling him of all that had\r\nhappened among our friends during his frequent absences from Liverpool,\r\nand he describing to me many of the adventures of himself and other\r\nprominent men in the movement, which were to me both interesting and\r\nexciting. Among these were his assistance in the escape of James\r\nStephens, of which I will speak later.\r\n\r\nBefore we parted, he arranged with me for my acting in Liverpool as a\r\nmedium of communication in the organisation. In this way I was, for\r\nseveral years, brought into constant contact with the leaders, nearly\r\nall of whom I met from time to time.\r\n\r\nI think the most capable Irishmen I ever met were the various members of\r\nthe Breslin family, with several of whom I was intimately acquainted.\r\nBravest among the brave, as they proved themselves at many a critical\r\nmoment, there were none more prudent. John Breslin was hospital steward\r\nin Richmond Prison when James Stephens, the Fenian chief, was imprisoned\r\nthere awaiting his trial.\r\n\r\nJohn Devoy was the man who successfully carried through, under the\r\ndirection of Colonel Kelly, the outside arrangements in connection with\r\nthe escape of the C.O.I.R. (Chief Organiser of the Irish Republic), as\r\nhe was called, in the early morning of the 24th of November, 1865.\r\n\r\nBut John Breslin it was who, with the assistance of Daniel Byrne, night\r\nwatchman, actually set Stephens free. Byrne was arrested and put upon\r\nhis trial for aiding the escape of Stephens, but nothing could be\r\nbrought home to him, and, after two successive juries had disagreed on\r\nhis case, he was released. Breslin, the chief instrument in the rescue,\r\nwas not suspected. He simply bided his time until he took his annual\r\nholiday, from which he never returned, leaving the country before there\r\nwas any suspicion of him. Michael Breslin, his brother, held a\r\nresponsible position in the Dublin police, and was the means of\r\nfrustrating many a well-laid scheme of the Castle, so that if the\r\nGovernment had its creatures in the revolutionary camp, the I.R.B. had\r\nagents in theirs.\r\n\r\nAnother, as I have already mentioned, who took part in the Stephens\r\nrescue was my friend John Ryan, better known in the Brotherhood as\r\nCaptain O'Doherty. At our interview in Liverpool on the occasion of my\r\ninitiation, he gave me a full account of this among other incidents. He\r\nwas, like Peter Maughan, an old schoolfellow of mine with the Christian\r\nBrothers in Liverpool. He was one of the men picked out by Colonel Kelly\r\nto be on guard when the \"old man\"--one of Stephens' pet nick-names--came\r\nover the prison wall. Ryan was a fine type of an Irishman, morally,\r\nintellectually and physically. As Stephens slipped down from the wall,\r\nholding on to the rope, he came with such force on my friend's\r\nshoulders as almost to bear him to the ground. In my \"Irish in Britain\"\r\nI have described in detail how Breslin got a key made for Stephens'\r\ncell, and how he and Byrne helped the C.O.I.R. over the prison wall to\r\nwhere his friends awaited him, and also the adventures of the Fenian\r\nleader after his escape from Richmond.\r\n\r\nThe man who made the key for Stephens' cell, from a mould taken by John\r\nBreslin, was Michael Lambert, a trusted member of the I.R.B. Though his\r\nname was well known to the initiated at the time, it never was mentioned\r\nuntil later years, he being always referred to previously as \"the\r\noptician.\"\r\n\r\nAfter remaining in concealment several months Stephens got away from\r\nIreland. The craft in which he escaped was one of a fleet of fishing\r\nhookers which sailed from Howth and Kinsale when engaged in their\r\nregular work. The owner, who was delighted to have a hand in such an\r\nenterprise, was a warm-hearted and patriotic Irishman, Patrick De Lacy\r\nGarton, for whom I acted as conducting agent, when he was returned by\r\nthe votes of his fellow-countrymen to the Liverpool Town Council, where\r\nhe sat as a Home Ruler.\r\n\r\nI met several times, during 1866 and later, one of the most remarkable\r\nmen connected with the organisation. He was known as \"Beecher,\" and was\r\na man of singular astuteness, as he required to be, particularly at the\r\ntime when, unknown to his colleagues, Corydon was giving information to\r\nthe police. If at any time Beecher had fallen into their hands, they\r\nmight have made a splendid haul, which would have paralysed the movement\r\non this side of the Atlantic, for he was the \"Paymaster.\" Captain\r\nMichael O'Rorke--otherwise \"Beecher\"--was a well-balanced combination of\r\nsagacity, cautiousness and daring, as you could not fail to see, if\r\nbrought into contact with him a few times. Stephens had the most\r\nabounding confidence in him, and it was well deserved. A native of\r\nRoscommon, he emigrated to America when a boy of thirteen. When the\r\nCivil War broke out he joined the Federal Army, and served with much\r\ndistinction. He was a member of the Fenian Brotherhood, and was greatly\r\npleased to be called upon for active service in Ireland, and, sailing\r\nfrom New York, he reached Dublin on the 27th of July, 1865, when he\r\nreported himself to the C.O.I.R. He was entrusted with the payment of\r\nthe American officers then in Ireland and Great Britain, which duty, I\r\nneed scarcely say, involved his keeping in constant touch with them. In\r\nthis way I, from time to time, came in contact with him in Liverpool,\r\nand was much impressed with the perfect way in which he carried out his\r\narduous duties. Before Stephens left for America, in March, 1866, he\r\ndirected Captain O'Rorke to send all the officers not arrested, and then\r\nin Ireland, over to England. This was a proper measure of prudence, as\r\nthe Irish Americans would be less objects of suspicion, and less liable\r\nto arrest here than in Ireland. He had fifty officers, and sometimes\r\nmore, to provide for as Paymaster, or, as the informers and detectives\r\nhad it, the \"Fenian Paymaster.\" He had to visit in this way at various\r\ntimes all parts of the British organisation, sometimes paying his men\r\npersonally, and at other times by letter, forwarded through trusted\r\nIrishmen in various places who had not laid themselves open to\r\nsuspicion. But he had to run his head into the lion's mouth\r\noccasionally, too, for it was part of his duty to visit Dublin at least\r\nonce a month. As a matter of precaution, there were but few who knew of\r\nany address where he might be found. At a time when Corydon had started\r\nto give information, but before \"Beecher\" actually knew of it, the\r\ninformer gave an address of his where he thought the \"Paymaster\" was to\r\nbe found to the Liverpool police. Major Greig, the chief constable, and\r\na strong body of his men, surrounded the house, but the bird had flown.\r\nAfter that, he was more cautious than ever, only letting his whereabouts\r\nbe known when it was absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\nA noted man among the Fenians was \"Pagan O'Leary.\" Jack Ryan told me of\r\nhow he rather surprised the prison officials when they came to classify\r\nhim under the head \"Religion.\" Being asked what he was, he said he was a\r\nPagan. No, they said, they could not accept that--they had headings _in\r\ntheir books_, \"Roman Catholic,\" \"Protestant,\" and \"Presbyterian,\" but\r\nnot \"Pagans.\" \"Well,\" he said, \"You have two kinds, the 'Robbers'\r\n(meaning Protestants) and the 'Beggars' (Catholics), and if I must\r\nchoose, put me down a 'Beggar.'\"\r\n\r\nA startling incident in connection with the Fenian movement, the daring\r\nplan to seize Chester Castle, will enable me to introduce two\r\nexceedingly interesting characters with whom I came in contact at this\r\ntime. The idea was to bring sufficient men from various parts of\r\nEngland, armed with concealed revolvers, to overpower the garrison,\r\nwhich at the time was a very weak one, and to seize the large store of\r\narms then in the Castle. In connection with this, arrangements had been\r\nmade for the cutting of wires, the taking up of rails, and the seizure\r\nof sufficient engines and waggons to convey the captured arms to\r\nHolyhead, whence, a steamer having been seized there for the purpose,\r\nthe arms were to be taken to Ireland, and the standard of insurrection\r\nraised. Of John Ryan, one of the leaders of this raid, I have already\r\nspoken. Another of them, Captain John McCafferty, was one of the\r\nIrish-American officers who had crossed the Atlantic to take part in the\r\nprojected rising in Ireland. I met him several times in Liverpool in\r\ncompany with John Ryan, and, from his own lips, got an account of his\r\nadventurous career up to that time.\r\n\r\nMost of the American officers I came in contact with during these years\r\nhad served in the Federal Army, but McCafferty fought on the side of the\r\nSouth in the American Civil War. He was a thorough type of a guerilla\r\nleader. With his well-proportioned and strongly-knit frame, and handsome\r\nresolute-looking bronzed face, you could imagine him just the man for\r\nany dashing and daring enterprise.\r\n\r\nI frequently met John Flood, too, whose name, with that of McCafferty,\r\nis associated with the Chester raid. He was then about thirty years of\r\nage, a fine, handsome man, tall and strong, wearing a full and flowing\r\ntawny-coloured beard. He had a genial-looking face, and, in your\r\nintercourse with him, you found him just as genial as he looked. He was\r\na man of distinguished bearing, who you could imagine would fill with\r\ngrace and dignity the post of Irish Ambassador to some friendly power.\r\nHe was a Wexford man, full of the glorious traditions of '98. He took an\r\nactive part in aiding the escape of James Stephens from Ireland. With\r\nColonel Kelly he was aboard the hooker in which the C.O.I.R. escaped,\r\nand to his skill and courage and rare presence of mind was largely due\r\nthe fact that Stephens did not again fall into the hands of his enemies.\r\n\r\nFrom then up to the time immediately preceding the Chester raid, he\r\nfrequently called on me in Liverpool in company with John Ryan.\r\n\r\nFather McCormick, of Wigan, a patriotic Irish priest, used to tell me,\r\ntoo, of the men coming to confession to him on their way to Chester, and\r\nafterwards to Ireland, for the rising on Shrove Tuesday. And yet these\r\nwere the kind of men for whom, according to a certain Irish bishop,\r\n\"Hell was not hot enough nor Eternity long enough.\"\r\n\r\nWhen John Ryan informed me of the plans that were being matured for the\r\nseizure of the arms and ammunition in Chester Castle, I volunteered for\r\nany duty that might be allotted to me. It was settled that I should hold\r\nmyself in readiness to carry out when called upon certain mechanical\r\narrangements in connection with the raid with a view to prevent\r\nreinforcements from reaching Chester.\r\n\r\nThese arrangements were to consist of the taking up of the rails on\r\ncertain railway lines and the cutting of the telegraphic wires leading\r\ninto Chester. I, therefore, surveyed the ground, and besides the\r\nrequired personal assistance, had in readiness crowbars, sledges, and,\r\namong other implements, the wrenches for unscrewing the nuts of the\r\nbolts fastening the fishplates which bound together the rails, end to\r\nend. I now held myself prepared for the moment when the call to action\r\nwould reach me.\r\n\r\nThis, however, never came, for I found afterwards that the leaders had\r\nlearned in time of Corydon's betrayal of the project, and made their\r\narrangements accordingly.\r\n\r\nI heard nothing further of the projected Chester expedition until\r\nMonday, February 11th, 1867.\r\n\r\nMy employment was at this time in Liverpool, but I lived on the opposite\r\nbank of the Mersey, at New Ferry. Anybody who has to travel in and out\r\nof town, as I did by the ferry boat, to his employment gets so\r\naccustomed to his fellow-passengers that he knows most of them by sight.\r\nBut this morning it was different. In a sense some of those I saw were\r\nstrangers to me, but I had a kind of instinct that they were my own\r\npeople. They were fine, athletic-looking young men, and had a\r\ntravel-stained appearance, as if they had been walking some distance\r\nover dusty roads.\r\n\r\nWhen I reached the landing stage and saw the morning's papers I got the\r\nexplanation--the police had heard of the projected raid.\r\n\r\nThese were our men returning from Chester, having been stopped on the\r\nroad by friends posted there for the purpose, and turned back--and were\r\nnow on their way through Liverpool to their homes in various parts of\r\nLancashire and Yorkshire. It seemed that the information of the project\r\nbeing abandoned had not reached them in time to prevent many of the men\r\nleaving their homes for Chester.\r\n\r\nI heard from John Ryan, whom I saw a few days afterwards, that the word\r\nhad been sent round to a certain number of circles in the North of\r\nEngland and the Midlands to move a number of picked men, some on the\r\nSunday night and some early on the Monday morning, and that the\r\npromptness and cheerfulness with which the order was obeyed was\r\nastonishing; so that, probably, not less than two thousand men were, by\r\ndifferent routes, quietly converging on Chester. Among these was Michael\r\nDavitt and others, from Haslingden as well as from several other\r\nLancashire towns.\r\n\r\nBut it was promptly discovered that information had been given to the\r\npolice authorities almost at the last moment. Those, therefore, who had\r\nalready reached Chester were sent back, and men were placed at the\r\nrailway stations and on the roads leading to Chester to stop those who\r\nwere coming. In this way the whole of the men forming the expedition\r\ndispersed as silently as they had come.\r\n\r\nCorydon had given the information to Major Greig, the Liverpool Head\r\nConstable, who at once communicated with Chester, where prompt measures\r\nwere taken to meet the threatened invasion.\r\n\r\nAccording to his own evidence in the subsequent trial, Corydon had been\r\ngiving information to the police since the previous September. There had\r\nbeen some suspicious circumstances in connection with him. A man\r\nresembling him in appearance, and evidently disguised, had been seen in\r\ncompany with individuals supposed to be police agents. But as there was\r\na man belonging to the organisation named Arthur Anderson, who strongly\r\nresembled Corydon, the real informer, suspicion fell upon Anderson.\r\n\r\nAfter Corydon had thrown off the mask and openly appeared as an\r\ninformer, I had an opportunity of seeing him, and, so far as my memory\r\nserves me, this is what he was like: At first sight you might set him\r\ndown as a third-rate actor or circus performer. He wore a frock coat,\r\nbuttoned tightly, to set off a by no means contemptible figure, and\r\ncarried himself with a jaunty, swaggering air, after the conventional\r\nstyle of a theatrical \"professional.\" He was about the middle height, of\r\nwiry, active build, with features clearly cut, thin face, large round\r\nforehead, a high aquiline nose, thick and curly hair, decidedly \"sandy\"\r\nin colour, and heavy moustache of the same tinge. His cheeks and chin\r\nwere denuded of beard.\r\n\r\nIt was in the Liverpool Police Court I saw John Joseph Corydon, as the\r\nnewspapers spelled his name--if it were his name, which is very\r\ndoubtful, for it was said in Liverpool that he was the son of an\r\nabandoned woman of that town.\r\n\r\nThere was at that time a reporter named Sylvester Redmond, whom I knew\r\nvery well, a very decent Irishman, who made a special feature of giving\r\nhumorous descriptions of the cases in the police court. I was told by\r\nsomeone in Court that the man whose hand Sylvester was so cordially\r\nshaking was the noted informer, Corydon. I was very much disgusted with\r\nthe old gentleman, until I heard afterwards that some wag among the\r\npolice had introduced the informer to him as a distinguished\r\nfellow-countryman.\r\n\r\nAfter the collapse of the Chester scheme, McCafferty and Flood made\r\ntheir way to Ireland to be ready for the Rising, but were arrested in\r\nDublin, charged with being concerned in the raid on Chester. They were\r\nboth in due course put upon their trials, and sent into penal servitude.\r\n\r\nI find, from a graphic sketch written for my \"Irish Library\" by William\r\nJames Ryan, that in the convict ship that took John Flood into penal\r\nservitude was another distinguished Irishman, John Boyle O'Reilly, whose\r\noffence against British rule was his successful recruiting for the\r\nI.R.B. among the soldiery. Another lieutenant of John Devoy, who had\r\ncharge of the organisation of the British army, was an old schoolfellow\r\nof mine with the Liverpool Christian Brothers, Peter Maughan, of whom I\r\nhave already spoken as a fellow-workman at the Curragh.\r\n\r\nBefore joining the I.R.B. Peter had been a member of the \"Brotherhood of\r\nSt. Patrick,\" an organisation which furnished many members to the \"Irish\r\nRevolutionary Brotherhood.\"\r\n\r\nMost of the Fenian prisoners were amnestied before the completion of\r\ntheir full terms. I have a letter in my possession from John McCafferty\r\nto our mutual friend, William Hogan, written from Millbank Prison, 6th\r\nJune, 1871. In this he regrets that the terms of his release will not\r\nallow of his paying Hogan a visit. He says:--\r\n\r\n     I know there are many who would like to shake my hand and bid me a\r\n     kind farewell. God bless you before my departure. My route will\r\n     afford me no opportunity of seeing the iron-bound coast of the home\r\n     of my forefathers. Still God may allow me to see that isle\r\n     again--Yes, and then perhaps I may meet somebody on the hills.\r\n\r\nHe concludes with love to William Hogan's family and \"Kind regard to\r\neach and every friend.\"\r\n\r\nMcCafferty did, I know, see the \"iron-bound\" coast of Ireland again, for\r\na few years after this an extremely mild and inoffensive-looking,\r\ndark-complexioned person, with black side whiskers, came into my\r\nplace--I was carrying on a printing and newsagency business--in Byron\r\nStreet, Liverpool, and, though I did not recognise him at first, I was\r\npleased to find that this Mr. Patterson, as he called himself, was no\r\nother than my old friend John McCafferty.\r\n\r\nThe mission he was engaged on was one that can only be described by the\r\nword amazing. So daring was it, so hedged around with apparent\r\nimpossibilities, that to the ordinary man its very conception would be\r\nincredible. But McCafferty was perfectly serious and determined about\r\nit, and to him it seemed practicable enough, provided only he could get\r\na few more men like himself: and indeed if the collection of just such a\r\ncompany of conspirators _were_ practicable, no doubt the impossible\r\nmight become possible enough. But the hypothesis is fatal, for the\r\nMcCafferty strain is a rare one indeed, so that his project never got\r\nfurther than an idea. I think, however, that I cannot be accused of\r\nexaggeration in saying that if he had been successful in carrying out\r\nhis idea, his achievement would have formed the most extraordinary\r\nchapter in English history--for it was no less than the abduction of the\r\nthen Prince of Wales, afterwards King Edward VII., and the holding of\r\nhim as a hostage for a purpose of the Fenian organisation.\r\n\r\nThe plan was to take him to sea in a sailing vessel, and to keep him\r\nthere, until the Fenian prisoners still at that time unreleased were set\r\nat liberty. He was to be treated with the utmost consideration and--the\r\nrecollection is not without its humorous side--McCafferty had a\r\nmemorandum to spare no pains in finding what were the favourite\r\namusements of the Prince, so that he might have a \"real good time\" on\r\nboard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE RISING OF 1867--ARREST AND RESCUE OF KELLY AND DEASY--THE MANCHESTER\r\nMARTYRDOM.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the Rising of 1867 had somewhat the character of \"a flash in\r\nthe pan,\" there were some heroic incidents in connexion with it. With\r\none of the Fenian leaders, James Francis Xavier O'Brien, I was brought\r\ninto intimate connection many years after the Rising, when we were both\r\nofficials, he as General Secretary and I as Chief Organiser, of the Home\r\nRule organisation in Great Britain. When put upon his trial there was\r\nevidence against him in connection with the taking of a police barrack,\r\nhe being in command of the insurgents. It was proved that he not only\r\nacted with courage, but with a humanity that was commended by the judge,\r\nin seeing that the women and children were got out safely before the\r\nplace was set on fire.\r\n\r\nThis, however, did not save him from being condemned to death--he was\r\nthe last man sentenced in the old barbarous fashion to be hanged, drawn\r\nand quartered--this sentence being afterwards commuted to penal\r\nservitude. Certainly, whether on the field or facing the scaffold for\r\nIreland there was no more gallant figure among the Fenian leaders than\r\nJames Francis Xavier O'Brien.\r\n\r\nFew knew of his sterling worth as I did. For several years after his\r\nreturn to liberty I was in close daily contact with this white-haired\r\nmild-looking old gentleman--still tolerably active and supple,\r\nthough--who could blaze up and fight to the death over what he\r\nconsidered a matter of principle. The most admirable feature in his\r\ncharacter was that, in all things you found him _straight_.\r\n\r\nOne of the Fenian chiefs I met in Liverpool was General Halpin, who, on\r\nthe night of the Rising, was in command of the district around Dublin.\r\nThe first of the insurgents who reached Tallaght, the place of\r\nrendezvous on the night of the 5th of March, 1867, were received by a\r\nvolley from the police and dispersed. One party had captured the police\r\nbarracks at Glencullen and Stepaside, and disarmed the police, but on\r\napproaching Tallaght, and hearing that all was over, they too dispersed.\r\n\r\nWhile most of the Irish-American officers bore the marks of their\r\nprofession rather too prominently for safety against the observance of a\r\ntrained detective, General Halpin was the last man in the world anyone\r\nwould, from his appearance, take to be a soldier. He looked far more\r\nlike a comfortable Irish parish priest. And yet he was, perhaps, the\r\nmost thoroughly scientific soldier of all those that crossed the\r\nAtlantic at this time.\r\n\r\nReading the evidence of Corydon in one of the trials, I find he\r\ndescribed Edmond O'Donovan as helping Halpin to make maps for use when\r\nthe Rising would take place. Knowing both men so well, I can say that\r\nnone better could be found for planning out a campaign. They were\r\nthoroughly scientific men, and always anxious to impart their knowledge\r\nto other Irishmen for the good of the Cause.\r\n\r\nI remember Halpin one night, at what was a kind of select social\r\ngathering, giving a number of us enthusiastic young men a lecture on the\r\nconstruction of fortifications and earthworks.\r\n\r\nWe bade him farewell when he was leaving Liverpool after the Rising, and\r\nthought he had got safely away to America, but, unfortunately, he was\r\nidentified at Queenstown in the outgoing steamer. He was arrested, put\r\nupon his trial, and met the same fate as so many of his comrades.\r\n\r\nAmong the men I knew long ago, who afterwards became connected with\r\nFenianism, was Stephen Joseph Meany. He was for many years a journalist\r\nin Liverpool, having been sub-editor of the \"Daily Post\" under Michael\r\nJames Whitty. He was an earnest and active Repealer and Young Irelander.\r\nWhen I first came in contact with him he was starting the \"Lancashire\r\nFree Press,\" which, after passing through several hands and several\r\nchanges, of name, ultimately became the \"Catholic Times,\" which was for\r\nthree years, when Father Nugent became the proprietor, under my\r\ndirection. Meany was a man of fine presence and handsome countenance, a\r\nbrilliant writer and an eloquent speaker. He went to America in 1860,\r\nwhere he followed his original profession of journalism for several\r\nyears. He returned to this country again, and was arrested in 1867 on a\r\ncharge of Fenianism, and sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment.\r\n\r\nLiverpool was flooded with refugees after the Rising, and it took us all\r\nour time to find employment for them, or to get them away to America. We\r\nhad then in Liverpool a corps of volunteers known as \"The Irish\r\nBrigade.\" Whatever Nationalist organisation might exist in the town\r\nalways strongly condemned young Irishmen for joining the corps. All we\r\ncould urge against it, however, could not prevent our young men who were\r\ncoming over from Ireland at this time from joining the \"Brigade\" for the\r\npurpose, they said, of learning and perfecting themselves in the use of\r\narms. Colonel Bidwell and the officers must have had a shrewd suspicion\r\nof the truth, and there was a common remark in the town upon the\r\nimproved physical appearance of the \"Brigade.\" This was, of course,\r\nowing to the number of fine soldier-like young Irishmen who at this time\r\nfilled its ranks.\r\n\r\nDuring the two years that followed the escape of Stephens, I met Colonel\r\nKelly several times in Liverpool. When I first saw him he would be about\r\nthirty years of age. This is my remembrance of his personal appearance:\r\nHis forehead was broad and square, with the thick dark hair carefully\r\ndisposed about it. He had somewhat high cheek bones, and wore a pointed\r\nmoustache over a tolerably full beard. The general impression of his\r\nface seemed to me slightly cynical, and he had a constant smile that\r\nbetokened self-possession and confidence. He sometimes wore a frock\r\ncoat, a light waistcoat buttoned high up, a black fashionable necktie,\r\nand light well-made trousers. After surveying him in detail, you would\r\ncome to the conclusion that he was a man of daring enough to involve\r\nhimself in danger of life, and with sufficient address to extricate\r\nhimself from the peril. He was undoubtedly a man capable of winning the\r\nconfidence and even devotion of others, as was shown when, falling into\r\nthe hands of the Government, he was snatched from their grasp in the\r\nopen day on the streets of Manchester.\r\n\r\nI met him some weeks after the Rising. The place of meeting reminded me\r\nof the incident in one of Samuel Lover's stories--\"Rory O'More\"--to\r\nwhich I have already alluded, for, in our later revolutionary movements,\r\nas in 1798, projects of great importance had sometimes to be discussed\r\nin public houses.\r\n\r\nA few of the Liverpool men came to meet the leaders in a very humble\r\nbeer shop, kept by a decent County Down man, Owen McGrady, in one of the\r\npoorer streets off Scotland Road. Here were met on this particular night\r\na notable company, which included, if I remember rightly, Colonel Kelly,\r\nColonel Rickard Burke, Captains Condon, Murphy, Deasy and O'Brien, all\r\nAmerican officers who had crossed the Atlantic for the Rising, and still\r\nremained, hoping for another opportunity. There were about half a dozen\r\nof the Liverpool men there. Of these I can remember a tall, fine-looking\r\nyoung man, a schoolmaster from the North of Ireland, whom I then met for\r\nthe first time, my old school-fellow, John Ryan, and John Meagher, a\r\ntailor, possessing the amount of eloquence you generally find in Irish\r\nmembers of the craft. There was also present, if I remember rightly, Tom\r\nGates, of Newcastle.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Rising had collapsed almost as soon as it commenced, the\r\ndetermination to fight on Irish soil had by no means been given up by\r\nthe leaders in America. That was why the American officers on this side\r\nremained at their posts, ready for active service at a moment's notice.\r\nAt the meeting we learned that there was at that moment an \"Expedition,\"\r\nas it was termed, on the sea to co-operate with and bring arms for\r\nanother Rising in Ireland, should such be found practicable. It was\r\nnotorious that, notwithstanding all the efforts of active agents,\r\ncomparatively few arms had been got into Ireland. Indeed, my friend John\r\nRyan, who was in a position to know, estimated that there were not more\r\nthan a couple of thousands of rifles in Ireland at the time of the\r\nRising.\r\n\r\nLet us see what became of the Expedition. This was, of course, what has\r\nsince become a matter of history--the secret despatch from New York of\r\nthe brigantine \"Erin's Hope,\" having on board several Irish-American\r\nofficers, 5,000 stand of arms, three pieces of field artillery, and\r\n200,000 cartridges. About the middle of May the vessel arrived in Irish\r\nwaters, agents going aboard at various points off the coast, including\r\nSligo Bay, which she reached on the 20th of May, 1867. By that time it\r\nwas found that the chances of another Rising were but slender, and the\r\n\"Erin's Hope\" returned to America with her cargo, entirely unmolested\r\nby the British cruisers, which were plentiful enough around the Irish\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\nThe expedition certainly proved that sufficient weapons to commence an\r\ninsurrection with could be thrown into Ireland, providing there was the\r\nnecessary co-operation at the time and places required.\r\n\r\nI have often thought since of what became of those present in Owen\r\nMcGrady's beer house the night we met there to prepare for the reception\r\nof the \"Erin's Hope.\"\r\n\r\nThe arrest and rescue of Kelly and Deasy, two of these, in the following\r\nSeptember, and the fate of their gallant rescuers, formed the most\r\nstriking and startling chapter of Irish history during the nineteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThat such a scheme as the rescue of the two Fenian chiefs should be\r\nsuccessfully carried out, not in Ireland amid sympathisers, but in the\r\nheart of a great English city, surrounded by a hostile population,\r\nshowed unexpected capacity and daring on the part of the revolutionary\r\norganisation, and produced consternation in the British Government.\r\n\r\nAt this time the organisation of the Irish Revolutionary Brotherhood in\r\nGreat Britain had been placed in the hands of three of the\r\nIrish-American officers, Captain Murphy, who had charge in Scotland,\r\nColonel Rickard Burke in the southern part of England, and Captain\r\nEdward O'Meagher Condon in the northern counties.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the arrest of the two leaders on the morning of September\r\n11th they, with Captain Michael O'Brien, had been staying with Condon,\r\nupon whom now devolved the command, the capture of Kelly and Deasy\r\nhaving taken place in his district.\r\n\r\nHe at once arranged for their food while in prison, for their defence in\r\nthe law courts, and for their rescue, in which latter enterprise he was\r\nenthusiastically supported by the chief men of the Manchester circles.\r\n\r\nBut, whatever their good will and courage, they were deficient both in\r\nmoney and arms for such a daring undertaking. Condon had, therefore, a\r\ndifficult task to accomplish. Money was soon raised, for our people are\r\never generous and equal to the occasion when it arises. Daniel\r\nDarragh--about whom I shall have more to say later--was sent to\r\nBirmingham, where by the aid of William Hogan he purchased and brought\r\nback with him sufficient revolvers to arm the volunteers for the rescue.\r\nThese last were picked men, the cream of the Manchester circles, and\r\nthere was some jealousy afterwards among many who had not been selected.\r\nI need scarcely say that the utmost secrecy was required in connection\r\nwith such a perilous enterprise.\r\n\r\nTo Edward O'Meagher Condon belongs the credit of having organised,\r\nmanaged, and carried out the Manchester Rescue, at the cost to himself,\r\nas it turned out, of years of penal servitude, and almost of his life.\r\nThough with the aid of Michael O'Brien and his Manchester friends he had\r\nmade all the arrangements, selecting the spot where the prison van was\r\nto be stopped, assigning to every man his post, and providing for every\r\ncontingency, including the possibility of the rescuing party being taken\r\nin the rear from Belle Vue prison, he wired for the assistance of\r\nCaptain Murphy and Colonel Burke, the message being that \"his uncle was\r\ndying.\"\r\n\r\nMurphy was from home, but Burke came on to Manchester, and with Michael\r\nO'Brien accompanied Condon on September 17th, the night before the\r\nrescue, to meet the men chosen for the daring enterprise, when the arms\r\nwere distributed, each man's post on the following day allotted to him,\r\nand the final arrangements made.\r\n\r\nThe two Fenian chiefs stayed with Condon that night, fighting their old\r\ncampaigns over again, e'er they retired to rest, not to meet again till\r\neleven years after the Manchester Rescue, when Condon and Burke came\r\nacross each other in New York, each having suffered in the interval a\r\nlong term of imprisonment, and it was the last night that Burke and\r\nCondon passed on earth with Michael O'Brien, whose memory Irishmen, the\r\nworld over, honour as one of the \"noble-hearted three\"--the Manchester\r\nMartyrs--who died for Ireland on the scaffold.\r\n\r\nThe secret of the intended rescue was closely guarded, and though the\r\nMayor of Manchester did get a warning wire from Dublin Castle, it\r\nreached too late, and the birds had flown. When Kelly and Deasy were\r\nbrought before the city magistrates they were remanded. \"They were,\"\r\nsaid the \"Daily News,\" \"placed in a cell with a view to removal to the\r\ncity jail at Belle Vue. At this time the police noticed outside the\r\ncourt house two men hanging about whom they suspected to be Fenians, and\r\na policeman made a rush at one of them to arrest him, in which he\r\nsucceeded, but not until the man had drawn a dagger and attempted to\r\nstab him, the blow being warded off. The other made his escape.\"\r\n\r\nAs to the incident just related, it seems that a patriotic but imprudent\r\nman belonging to one of the Manchester circles had got to hear of the\r\nintended rescue, and was indignant at being left out. His suspicious\r\nconduct outside the court house drew the attention of the police--as we\r\nhave seen--with the result, as the paper said, that the authorities\r\nbecame alarmed. Kelly and Deasy were put in irons on their removal, and\r\na strong body of police were sent with the van intended to take them to\r\nBelle Vue Prison.\r\n\r\nIt was the custom for a policeman to ride outside the van, on the step\r\nbehind, but, on this occasion, owing to the incident just described,\r\nBrett, the officer in charge, went _inside_ the van. The door was then\r\nlocked, and the keys handed to him through the ventilator.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that, up to this point, the Manchester police had no\r\nsuspicion of the intended rescue, and it was only the imprudent\r\nbehaviour of the man whom the police had arrested that caused additional\r\nprecautions to be taken. Certain it is that if the Manchester\r\nauthorities had had any information of the probability of an attempted\r\nrescue there would have been a formidable escort of the police and\r\nmilitary.\r\n\r\nWith so much false swearing at the trials with regard to the facts of\r\nthe Manchester Rescue, it is important that the information given in\r\nbooks for the benefit of the present and future generations of Irishmen\r\nshould be correct. It is serious that in some of our best books so\r\nimportant a matter as the actual scene of the rescue is incorrectly\r\ngiven. One book says: \"The van drove off for the _County jail at\r\nSalford_.\" In another description it is stated: \"Just as the van passed\r\nunder the arch that spans Hyde Road at Belle Vue, a _point midway\r\nbetween the city police office and the Salford Jail,_ etc.\" Following\r\nthis, one of our ablest writers, apparently quoting from the previous\r\ndescriptions, falls into the same error. I can readily understand how\r\nthese errors have arisen--the writers concerned have confounded the\r\nplace of the execution of the Manchester Martyrs, Salford Jail, with the\r\nprison, Belle Vue, to which the prisoners were being taken on being\r\nremanded.\r\n\r\nThe point chosen by Condon as the most suitable for the attack was\r\ncertainly where the railway bridge crosses Hyde Road, but if the van had\r\nbeen going to Salford Jail it would have been in a totally different\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nSince writing the above, I find it still more necessary I should correct\r\nthe mis-statement as to the scene of the rescue, for the error seems to\r\nbe getting perpetuated. I find in one of the leading Irish-American\r\nnewspapers, in a description of the death of Colonel Kelly on February\r\n5, 1909, the scene of the rescue is given as \"_midway between the\r\npolice office and Salford Jail_.\" This is evidently taken from the\r\nerroneous statement in the books I have referred to.\r\n\r\nAfter this slight digression, may I resume my narrative.\r\n\r\nAt the police court a man appointed for the purpose took a cab in\r\nadvance of the van. When sufficiently close to them he waved a white\r\nhandkerchief as a signal to the men in ambush. Just as the van passed\r\nunder the railway arch two men with revolvers barred the way.\r\n\r\n\"Stop the van!\" one cried. But the driver took no heed. A bullet fired\r\nover his head and another into one of the horses effectually stopped the\r\nvan. At the sound of the shots the rest of the rescuers came from their\r\nambush behind the walls that lined the road, and from the shadow of the\r\nabutments of the railway arch.\r\n\r\nThe police fled panic-stricken at the first volley fired over their\r\nheads by the Fenians, for these wanted to release their chiefs without\r\nbloodshed if possible. One portion of the assailants, carrying out a\r\npre-arranged plan, formed an extended circle around the van, and kept\r\nthe police and mob who had rallied to their assistance at bay, while a\r\nsecond party set themselves to effecting an entrance to the van. This\r\nwas more difficult than had been expected, for had Brett ridden on the\r\nstep behind as usual the keys could readily have been taken from him.\r\nThe rescuing party were, however, equal to the occasion, and the\r\nmilitary precision with which the work was carried out displayed the\r\ndiscipline of the men and the able direction of the leaders.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the fullest testimony is borne to this by a great English\r\nnewspaper, the \"Daily News,\" which, while showing the most intense\r\nhostility to the men and their daring act, is thus compelled to\r\nrecognise the courage and discipline of the devoted band of\r\nFenians:--\"The more astonishing, therefore, is it to read of the\r\nappearance of the public enemy in the heart of one of our greatest\r\ncities, organised and armed, overpowering, wounding and murdering the\r\nguardians of public order, and releasing prisoners of state. There is a\r\ndistinctness of aim, a tenacity of purpose, a resolution in execution\r\nabout the Fenian attack upon the police van which is very impressive.\r\nThe blow was sudden and swift, and effected its object. In the presence\r\nof a small but compact body of Fenians, provided with repeating\r\nfirearms, the police were powerless, and the release of Kelly and Deasy\r\nwas quickly effected.\"\r\n\r\nAn unfortunate accident was the killing of Brett, the policeman, by a\r\nshot fired with the intention of breaking the lock of the van. A female\r\nprisoner then handed out the keys on the demand of the Fenians outside,\r\nand the door was quickly opened, and the two leaders brought out, their\r\nsafe retreat being guarded by their rescuers.\r\n\r\nAs Captain Condon had anticipated and provided for, some of the warders\r\nfrom Belle Vue quickly came upon the scene, as it was but a short\r\ndistance across what were then brickfields from the prison to the scene\r\nof action. But, when they saw the determined men who were guarding the\r\nleaders' retreat, they, too, like the police, kept at a safe distance\r\nfrom the Fenian revolvers, and devoted themselves to picking up any\r\nstragglers who had got separated from the main body of Irishmen.\r\n\r\nIn this way a number of arrests were made, and, later on, Condon himself\r\nwas taken, but the main object had been accomplished, and Kelly and\r\nDeasy got safely away, and, ultimately, as we shall see, out of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nFollowing the rescue, there was a perfect reign of terror, the police\r\nauthorities striking out wildly in all directions to gather into their\r\nnet enough Irish victims to satisfy their baffled vengeance. There were\r\nnumerous arrests and no lack of witnesses to swear anything to secure\r\nconvictions. Every detail of the attack on the van while on the way from\r\nthe courthouse to the prison, and of the release of the prisoners was\r\nsworn to with the utmost minuteness, as the witnesses professed to\r\nidentify one after another of the men in the dock, some of whom had no\r\nconnection or sympathy with the rescue at all.\r\n\r\nIn Liverpool, men whom I knew were arrested who were at work all that\r\nday at the docks, and yet were sworn to by numerous witnesses as having\r\nassisted in the attack on the van in Hyde Road, Manchester, the most\r\nminute details being given.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned a case of the kind in my \"Irish in Britain.\" William\r\nMurphy, of Manchester, a man whom I knew well, was convicted and sent\r\ninto penal servitude as having taken part in the rescue. On his\r\nliberation I was surprised to learn from his own lips that, although he\r\nwould gladly have borne his part if detailed for the duty, he was not\r\npresent at the rescue of the Fenian leaders. With the authorities in\r\nsuch a panic, it can readily be understood that it behoved any of us in\r\nLancashire who were in any way regarded as \"suspects\" to be ready with\r\nvery solid testimony as to where we were on the day in question.\r\n\r\nIn a recent letter I have had from Captain Condon--from whom\r\ncommunications reach me from all parts of America, for he is constantly\r\ntravelling, holding as he does the post of Inspector of Public Buildings\r\nin connection with the Treasury Department of the U.S.A.--he tells me\r\nsomething about William Murphy that I never heard before. He says: \"When\r\nAllen, Larkin, O'Brien, myself, and the other men were sentenced, Digby\r\nSeymour (one of the counsel for the prisoners) went down to a large cell\r\nin the court house basement where all the others were kept together. He\r\nurged them all to plead 'guilty' and throw themselves upon the mercy of\r\nthe court, declaring that, if they refused to do this all would be\r\nconvicted and executed.\r\n\r\n\"There was an instant's hesitation among the prisoners, but William\r\nMurphy, who was later sentenced to seven years penal servitude,\r\naddressed his comrades, urging them to stand fast together, imitate our\r\nexample, and die like men, rather than live like dogs, for as such they\r\nwould be regarded by all true Irishmen if they pleaded 'guilty.'\r\n\r\n\"To a man the whole twenty-two shouted out--'We will never plead\r\nguilty!'\r\n\r\n\"And Seymour, baffled and irritated, went away without accomplishing his\r\npurpose.\"\r\n\r\nOf the men convicted for taking part in the rescue, five--Allen, Larkin,\r\nO'Brien, Condon and Maguire--were sentenced to death. Condon was\r\nreprieved, really on account of his American citizenship, and Maguire,\r\nwho was a marine, because the authorities discovered in time that the\r\nevidence against him was false. A number of others were sent to penal\r\nservitude for various terms.\r\n\r\nThe execution of Allen, Larkin and O'Brien, so far from striking terror,\r\nbut gave new life to the cause of Irish Freedom, and to-day, over the\r\nworld, no names in the long roll of those who have suffered and died for\r\nIreland are more honoured than those of the \"Manchester Martyrs,\" while\r\nthe determination has become all the stronger that, in the words of our\r\nNational Anthem--founded on Condon's defiant shout in the dock of \"God\r\nSave Ireland!\":--\r\n\r\n     On the cause must go\r\n     Amidst joy or weal or woe,\r\n  Till we've made our isle a Nation free and grand.\r\n\r\nIt is not generally known how Colonel Kelly got out of the country after\r\nthe rescue. He lay concealed in the house of an Irish professional man\r\nfor some weeks, and then, all the railway stations being closely and\r\nconstantly watched night and day, he was driven in a conveyance by road\r\nall the way from Manchester to Liverpool.\r\n\r\nIt was a patriotic foreman ship-joiner, whom I knew well, who actually\r\ngot him away to America. My friend Egan had charge of the fitting up of\r\nthe berths aboard the steamer in which Colonel Kelly sailed. In emigrant\r\nsteamers the usual practice was for temporary compartments to be made\r\nand taken down at the end of the voyage. I had fitted up such berths\r\nmyself, and therefore perfectly understood what my friend had done to\r\nsecure Colonel Kelly's escape when he described it to me afterwards at\r\nmy place in Byrom Street. Egan actually built a small secret\r\ncompartment, so constructed as to attract no notice, and when Kelly was\r\nsmuggled aboard at the last moment--he might be supposed to be one of\r\nEgan's men--he was put into it and actually boarded up, sufficient\r\nprovisions being left with him, until the steamer got clear of British\r\nwaters, when he could come out with safety.\r\n\r\nDeasy also made his way to America.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the after-career of those assembled that night at\r\nMcGrady's, I have sufficiently accounted for Michael O'Brien.\r\n\r\nRickard Burke, who also assisted at the same gathering, was a remarkable\r\npersonality, and one of the most astute men I ever met. He was a\r\ngraduate of Queen's College, Cork, and an accomplished linguist. He was\r\na skilful engineer, and had served with distinction in the American\r\nCivil War. When I knew him he was about thirty-five years of age, tall\r\nand of fine presence. To him was deputed the work of purchasing arms\r\nfor the intended Rising in Ireland.\r\n\r\nAfter many adventures, he fell into the hands of the police, was\r\nconvicted, and sentenced to a long term of imprisonment. It was with the\r\nidea of effecting his rescue that the Clerkenwell Prison wall was blown\r\nup on December 13th, 1867, this insane plan causing the death and\r\nmutilation of a number of people. Burke himself would probably have been\r\nkilled had he happened to be confined in that part of the jail that was\r\nblown up.\r\n\r\nWhile in Chatham prison he was reported as having lost his reason, and\r\nwas removed to Woking. The matter was brought before the House of\r\nCommons by Mr. McCarthy Downing, who suggested that Burke's insanity had\r\nbeen caused by his treatment in prison. He was released on Sunday, July\r\n9th, 1871.\r\n\r\nCaptain Murphy, another of the company in our Scotland Road rendezvous,\r\nwhom I had often met before, was a gentlemanly, genial man of portly\r\npresence, and an exceedingly pleasant companion. After some time he\r\nfound his way back to America.\r\n\r\nEdward O'Meagher Condon was one of the American officers I most\r\nfrequently came in contact with in Liverpool, previous to and after the\r\nRising. Since his return to America, after his release from penal\r\nservitude in 1878, we have frequently corresponded with each other. From\r\na report of a Manchester Martyr's Commemoration in a newspaper which\r\naccompanied one of his letters, and conversations I had with him when I\r\nwas delighted to have him as my guest during his recent visit to this\r\ncountry, I find he has just the same sanguine temperament as on that\r\nnight at McGrady's, when the chances of another Rising were being\r\ndiscussed. In the report I refer to he says, \"Had the Irish people been\r\nfurnished with the necessary arms and munitions of war, which ought and\r\ncould have been provided, they would have proved victors in the\r\ncontest.\"\r\n\r\nI have no doubt but that, in propounding this view, he had in his mind\r\nthe probability there was at one point of England being embroiled in a\r\nquarrel with America. None knew better than he, at the time, of the\r\nenormous number of Irishmen in the American armies, on both sides,\r\nduring the Civil War who, with their military training, longed for the\r\ntask of sweeping English rule from the soil of Ireland. It will be\r\nremembered that it was Condon who, when sentenced to death, concluded\r\nhis speech in the dock with the prayer, \"God save Ireland!\" the words\r\nwhich have since become the rallying cry of the whole Irish race, and\r\nhave given us a National Anthem.\r\n\r\nIn his letters to me since his first return to America, I have been\r\ngratified to hear that he always took a warm interest in my\r\npublications. I am pleased, too, to find from the newspaper reports he\r\nhas sent me that he is, as ever, an eminently practical man, and\r\nbelieves in using the means nearest to hand for the advancement of the\r\nIrish Cause.\r\n\r\nWhile giving his experiences in connection with the revolutionary\r\nmovement, he declares that no one can blame the Irish people for having\r\nrecourse to any means which may enable them to remain on their native\r\nsoil. They have, he says, to use whatever means have been left to save\r\nthemselves from extermination and Ireland from becoming a desert. He,\r\ntherefore, declares his sympathy with the later movements of the Irish\r\npeople--the Land League, the National League, and the United Irish\r\nLeague, while never abandoning the principles of '98, '48 and '67.\r\n\r\nI referred to two Liverpool men as being present at the meeting at\r\nMcGrady's. One of these, John Ryan, my dear old schoolfellow, one of the\r\nrescuers of James Stephens, has been dead many years--God rest his soul!\r\nHe was a noble character, and would have risen to the top in any walk of\r\nlife, but though he had a good home--his father was a prosperous\r\nmerchant of Liverpool--he gave his whole life to Ireland. I often heard\r\nfrom him of his adventures, for he always looked me up whenever he came\r\nto Liverpool, and how, sometimes, he and his friends had to fare very\r\nbadly indeed.\r\n\r\nIt was most extraordinary that, while constantly Tunning risks, for he\r\nwas a man of great daring, he never once was arrested, though he had\r\nsome hair-breadth escapes. On one occasion, about the time of the\r\nRising, a good, honest, Protestant member of the Brotherhood, Sam\r\nClampitt, was taken out of the same bedroom in which he was sleeping\r\nwith Ryan, who was left, the police little thinking of the bigger fish\r\nthey had allowed to escape from their net, the noted Fenian leader,\r\n\"Captain O'Doherty.\" I forget his precise name at this particular time,\r\nbut it was a very Saxon one, for he was supposed to be an English\r\nartist sketching in Ireland. Questioned by the police, he was able to\r\nsatisfy them of his _bona fides_. He had a friend in Liverpool, an old\r\nschoolfellow like myself, Richard Richards--\"Double Dick\" we used to\r\ncall him--a patriotic Liverpool-born Irishman. He was an exceedingly\r\nable artist, making rapid progress in his profession, and, about this\r\ntime, having some very fine pictures, for which he got good prices, on\r\nthe walls of the Liverpool Academy Exhibition. Richards supplied all the\r\ntrappings for the part that Ryan was playing, and also sent him letters\r\nof a somewhat humorous character, which he sometimes read to me before\r\nsending off. In these he was anticipating all sorts of adventures for\r\nhis friend in the then disturbed state of Ireland. As John Ryan had much\r\nartistic taste, and was himself a fair draughtsman, and well up in all\r\nthe necessary technicalities, and as Richards' letters, which he always\r\ncarried for emergencies like this, were strong evidences in his favour,\r\nhe had not much difficulty in convincing the Dublin police he was what\r\nhe represented himself to be.\r\n\r\nSome of Jack Ryan's reminiscences had their droll sides, for he had a\r\nkeen sense of humour. One of his stories was in connection with the\r\nwell-known old tradition of the Gaels--both Irish and Scottish--that\r\nwherever the \"_Lia Fail_\" or \"Stone of Destiny\" may be must be the seat\r\nof Government. There is some doubt, as is well known, as to where the\r\nreal stone now is. At all events, the stone which is under the\r\nCoronation Chair in Westminster Abbey is that which was taken from\r\nScone by King Edward, and that on which the Scottish monarchs were\r\ncrowned, having been originally brought from Ireland, the cradle of the\r\nGaelic race. The tradition is still, as it happens, borne out by the\r\nfact that Westminster is _now_ the seat of Government.\r\n\r\nNow two of John Ryan's Fenian friends, Irish-American officers, stranded\r\nin London--a not unusual circumstance--just when affairs looked very\r\nblack indeed, conceived the brilliant idea of _stealing the stone_,\r\nbringing it over to Ireland, and, once for all, settling the Irish\r\nquestion. This, notwithstanding their oath to \"The Irish _Republic_ now\r\nvirtually (virtuously some of our friends used to say) established,\" for\r\nit did not seem to strike them that they were proposing to bring to\r\nIreland an emblem of royalty.\r\n\r\nI never heard if they took any actual steps to accomplish their object.\r\nPerhaps they were impressed by the mechanical difficulties, as I was\r\nmyself one day, when standing with David Barrett, an Irish National\r\nLeague organiser, in Edward the Confessor's Chapel, in front of the\r\nfamous \"_Lia Fail_.\" It is a rough-hewn stone, about two feet each way,\r\nand ten inches deep. I was telling my friend the story of the plot to\r\ncarry off the \"Stone of Destiny,\" and was making a calculation, based on\r\nthe weight of a cubic foot of stone, of what might be its weight.\r\n\r\n\"We'll soon see,\" said David, and, in a moment, he had vaulted over the\r\nrailing, and taken hold of a corner of the stone.\r\n\r\nBut, so closely is this national treasure watched, that instantaneously\r\na couple of attendants appeared, and broke up peremptorily our proposed\r\ncommittee of enquiry. An archaeological friend of mine suggests that,\r\none day, when Ireland is making her own laws and able to enter on equal\r\nterms into a contract with England, a reasonable stipulation would be\r\nthe restoration of that stone--unless the Scottish Gaels can prove a\r\nstronger claim to it.\r\n\r\nFrom John Ryan I heard of the mode of living of many of the Fenian\r\norganisers and of the Irish-American officers,--very different from the\r\nslanderous statements of their \"living in luxury upon the wages of Irish\r\nservant girls in America.\" John was of a cheery disposition, never\r\ncomplaining, but always sanguine, and loving to look at the bright side\r\nof things. Yet I could see for myself, each time I saw him, how the life\r\nof hardship he was leading was telling upon his once splendid\r\nconstitution, and, I felt sure, shortening his days. John Ryan, I have\r\noften said, is dead for Ireland, for though he did not perish on the\r\nbattlefield or on the scaffold, as would have been his glory, I most\r\ncertainly believe he would have been alive to-day but for the hardships\r\nsuffered in doing his unostentatious work for Ireland.\r\n\r\nThere is one other friend I mentioned as having been present that night\r\nat Owen McGrady's--the school master. You will ask what became of him?\r\nAlmost the last time I spoke to him--not very long before these lines\r\nwere written--was in the inner lobby of the British House of Commons,\r\nfor he has been for many years a member of Parliament. Now some of my\r\nmost cherished friends are or have been members of Parliament, and I\r\nwould be sorry to think any of them worse Irishmen than myself on that\r\naccount. Their taking the oath of allegiance to the British sovereign\r\nwas a matter for their own consciences, but I never could bring myself\r\nto do it. Mr. Parnell would, I know, have been pleased to see me in\r\nParliament, but he knew that I never would take the oath, and respected\r\nmy conscientious objections to swear allegiance to any but my own\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of a few, whose names I forget, I have accounted for\r\nthe whole of the company comprising the Council of War at McGrady's\r\npublic house. Summed up as follows, nothing in the pages of romance\r\ncould be more startling than the after fate of these men:--\r\n\r\n     CAPTAIN MICHAEL O'BRIEN.--Hanged at Manchester. R.I.P.\r\n\r\n     COLONEL RICKARD BURKE.--Sent to Penal Servitude--Returned to\r\n     America.\r\n\r\n     COLONEL THOMAS KELLY, CAPTAIN TIMOTHY DEASY.--Rescued from Prison\r\n     Van in Manchester.\r\n\r\n     CAPTAIN EDWARD O'MEAGHER-CONDON.--Sentenced to death for the\r\n     Manchester Rescues, but reprieved and sent to Penal\r\n     Servitude--Returned to America.\r\n\r\n     CAPTAIN MURPHY.--Returned to America. Died a few years since.\r\n\r\n     THE SCHOOLMASTER.--A Member of Parliament.\r\n\r\n     JOHN RYAN.--Dead--God rest his soul.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nA DIGRESSION--T.D. SULLIVAN--A NATIONAL ANTHEM--THE EMERALD\r\nMINSTRELS--\"THE SPIRIT OF THE NATION.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIf it were for nothing else, it will be sufficient fame for T.D.\r\nSullivan for all time that he is the author of \"God Save Ireland.\" He\r\nhad no idea himself, as he used to tell me, that the anthem would have\r\nbeen taken up so instantaneously and enthusiastically as it was.\r\n\r\nA National Anthem can never be made to order. It must grow spontaneously\r\nout of some stirring incident of the hour. Never in those days were our\r\npeople so deeply moved as by the Manchester Martyrdom. There is no\r\ngrander episode in all Irish history. The song of \"God Save Ireland,\"\r\nembodying the cry raised by Edward O'Meagher Condon, and taken up by his\r\ndoomed companions in the dock, so expressed the feelings of all hearts\r\nthat it was at once accepted by Irishmen the world over as the National\r\nAnthem.\r\n\r\nI sympathise with the ground taken up by our friends of the Gaelic\r\nLeague that a National Anthem should be in the national tongue. That\r\nobjection has to some extent been met by the very fine translation of\r\n\"God Save Ireland\" into Gaelic by Daniel Lynch. This appeared in one of\r\nmy publications, and is the version now frequently sung at Irish\r\npatriotic gatherings.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the objection that the air--\"Tramp, tramp, the boys are\r\nmarching\"--to which T.D. wrote the song is of American origin, I was\r\nunder the impression that Patrick Sarsfield Gilmore, the famous\r\nIrish-American bandmaster, was the composer of it, and that, therefore,\r\nwe could claim the air of \"God Save Ireland\" as being Irish as well as\r\nthe words. To place the matter beyond doubt, Gilmore himself being dead,\r\nI wrote to his daughter, Mary Sarsfield Gilmore, a distinguished\r\npoetical contributor to the \"Irish World,\" to ascertain the facts. I got\r\nfrom her a most interesting reply, in which she said, \"I am more than\r\nsorry to disappoint you by my answer, but my father was _not_ the\r\ncomposer of the air you mention.\"\r\n\r\nI have heard it suggested that McCann's famous war song \"O'Donnell\r\nAboo!\" should be adopted as our National Anthem instead of \"God Save\r\nIreland,\" and I have heard of it being given as a _finale_ at Gaelic\r\nLeague concerts.\r\n\r\nWithout doubt it is a fine song, and the air to which it is generally\r\nsung is a noble one. A distinguished Irish poet tells me he is of\r\nopinion that \"what will be universally taken up as the Irish National\r\nAnthem has never yet been written.\" My friend may be right, but let us\r\nsee what claim \"O'Donnell Aboo!'\"--song or air--has upon us for adoption\r\nas our National Anthem.\r\n\r\nTo do this I must go back in my narrative to the time when I made the\r\nacquaintance of Mr. Michael Joseph McCann, its author. This was a few\r\nyears before \"God Save Ireland\" was written, and over twenty years after\r\n\"O'Donnell Aboo!\" appeared in the \"Nation.\"\r\n\r\nA party of young Irishmen from Liverpool engaged the Rotunda, Dublin,\r\nfor a week. They called themselves the \"Emerald Minstrels,\" and gave an\r\nentertainment--\"Terence's Fireside; or the Irish Peasant at Home.\" I was\r\none of the minstrels. The entertainment consisted of Irish national\r\nsongs and harmonized choruses, interspersed with stories such as might\r\nbe told around an Irish fireside. There was a sketch at the finish,\r\nwinding up with a jig.\r\n\r\nAt my suggestion, one of the pieces in our programme was \"O'Donnell\r\nAboo!\" which first appeared in the \"Nation\" of January 28th, 1843, under\r\nthe title of \"The Clan-Connell War Song--A.D. 1597,\" the air to which it\r\nwas to be sung being given as \"Roderigh Vich Alpine dhu,\" This was the\r\nname of the boat song commencing \"Hail to the Chief,\" from Sir Walter\r\nScott's poem of \"The Lady of the Lake.\" This was published in 1810, and\r\nset to music for three voices soon afterwards by Count Joseph Mazzinghi,\r\na distinguished composer of Italian extraction, born in London.\r\n\r\nAs \"Roderigh Vich Alpine\" was the air given by Mr. McCann himself as\r\nthat to which his song was to be sung, we, of course, used Mazzinghi's\r\nmusic in our entertainment.\r\n\r\nOne night--I think it was our first--at the close of our entertainment\r\nin Dublin, a gentleman came behind to see us. It was Mr. McCann. He was\r\npleased, he said, we were singing his song, but would like us to use an\r\nair to which it was being sung in Ireland, and which _he had put to it\r\nhimself_. He also told us he had made some alterations in the _words_ of\r\nthe song, and was good enough to write into my \"Spirit of the Nation\"\r\nthe changes he had made. This copy is the original folio edition, with\r\nmusic, published in 1845. It was presented to me by the members of St.\r\nNicholas's Boys' Guild, Liverpool. I have that book still, and value it\r\nall the more as containing the handwriting of the distinguished poet. (I\r\nshould say, however, that most of my friends do not consider the\r\nalterations in the song to be improvements.)\r\n\r\nThe measure and style of \"O'Donnell Aboo!\" were evidently imitated from\r\nSir Walter Scott's boat song. Besides this strong resemblance, there is\r\nthe fact that Mr. McCann gave as the air to which his song was to be\r\nsung, \"Roderigh Vich Alpine,\" part of the burden of Sir Walter's song.\r\n\r\nBut not only is there a resemblance in the words and general style, but\r\nin the music. Indeed, it seems to me that most of the fine air of\r\n\"O'Donnell Aboo!\" as it is now sung is based on Mazzinghi's\r\nmusic--either that for the first, second, or bass voice, or upon the\r\nconcerted part for the three voices at the end of each verse.\r\n\r\nAnother fact is worthy of mention. Since meeting Mr. McCann I have often\r\nnoticed in Irish papers that when the air, as adapted by him, was played\r\nat national gatherings, it was often given by the name of Scott's song\r\nand Mazzinghi's composition. And when Mr. Parnell was in the height of\r\nhis popularity and attended demonstrations in Ireland, the air used to\r\nbe played as being applicable to the Irish leader, and given in some\r\npapers as \"Hail to the Chief,\" while others described the same air as\r\n\"O'Donnell Aboo!\"\r\n\r\nBut if we cannot claim as an original Irish air McCann's song as it is\r\nnow sung, the same critical examination which brings out its resemblance\r\nto Mazzinghi's music, also shows that the Italian composer most probably\r\ngot his inspiration from the music of the Irish or Scottish Gaels, as\r\nbeing most suitable for his theme. So that, perhaps, we may take the\r\nsame pride in the present air as our island mother might in some of her\r\nchildren who had been on the _shaughraun_ for a time, but had again come\r\nback to the \"old sod.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be that even before the era of Irish independence some inspired\r\npoet may write, to some old or new Irish melody, a song which, by its\r\ntranscendent merits, may spring at once into the first place. But until\r\nthat happens, or till \"we've made our isle a nation free and grand\" I\r\nthink we may very well rest content with \"God Save Ireland.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested to me that it might form an interesting portion of\r\nthese recollections if I were to give some account of how we came to\r\nstart the \"Emerald Minstrels,\" and what we did while that company was in\r\nexistence. I may say without hesitation that we got our inspiration from\r\nthe teaching of Young Ireland and the \"Spirit of the Nation.\" We called\r\nour entertainment \"Terence's Fireside; or The Irish Peasant at Home.\"\r\n\r\nWe had most of us been boys in the old Copperas Hill school, then in the\r\nYoung Men's Guild connected with the church, and some of us members of\r\nthe choir. At the Guild meetings on Sunday nights, the chaplain, Father\r\nNugent, an Irishman, but, like most of ourselves, born out of his own\r\ncountry, used to delight in teaching us elocution, and encouraging us to\r\nwrite essays, besides putting other means of culture in our way.\r\n\r\nAfter a time he founded an educational establishment, the Catholic\r\nInstitute, where, when he left Copperas Hill, many of us followed him\r\nand joined the evening classes. About this good priest I shall have more\r\nto say in this narrative, and, though he was no politician, I don't\r\nthink any man ever did so much to elevate the condition of the Irish\r\npeople of his native town, and make them both respectable--in the best\r\nsense--and respected, as Father Nugent.\r\n\r\nWe started the \"Emerald Minstrels\" at a time when there was a lull in\r\nIrish politics; our objects being the cultivation of Irish music, poetry\r\nand the drama; Irish literature generally, Irish pastimes and customs;\r\nand, above all, Irish Nationality.\r\n\r\nFather Nugent's training from the time we were young boys had been\r\ninvaluable. We numbered ten, the most brilliant member of our body, and\r\nthe one who did most in organising our entertainments, being John\r\nFrancis McArdle. Besides our main objects, already stated, we considered\r\nwe were doing good work by elevating the tastes of our people, who had,\r\nthrough sheer good nature, so long tolerated an objectionable class of\r\nso-called Irish songs, as well as the still more objectionable \"Stage\r\nIrishman.\"\r\n\r\nSome items from the programme will give an idea of our entertainment. We\r\nopened with a prologue, originally written by myself, but re-cast and\r\nvery much improved by John McArdle. I may say that we two often did a\r\nconsiderable amount of journalistic work in that way in after years. I\r\ncan just remember a little of the prologue. These were the opening\r\nlines:--\r\n\r\n  Sons of green Erin, we greet you this night!\r\n  And you, too, her daughters--how welcome the sight!\r\n  We come here before you, a minstrel band,\r\n  To carol the lays of our native land.\r\n\r\nThere was one particularly daring couplet in it, the contribution of\r\nJohn McArdle:--\r\n\r\n  In your own Irish way give us one hearty cheer.\r\n  Just to show us at once that you welcome us here.\r\n\r\nHad mine been the task to speak these lines, I must inevitably have\r\nfailed to get the required response, but in the mouth of the regular\r\nreciter they never once missed fire. This was Mr. Barry Aylmer. He\r\nafterwards adopted the stage as a profession, and became recognised as a\r\nvery fine actor, chiefly in Irish parts, as might be expected. He also\r\ntravelled with a very successful entertainment of his own, and it is but\r\na short time since he informed me that he spoke our identical \"Emerald\r\nMinstrel\" prologue in New York and other cities in America, adapting it,\r\nof course, to the circumstances of the occasion. I found that during the\r\nmany years which had elapsed since I had previously seen him until I met\r\nhim again quite recently he had been a great traveller, not only in this\r\ncountry and America, but also in South Africa and Australia.\r\n\r\nWe had a number of harmonized choruses, including several of Moore's\r\nmelodies, Banim's \"Soggarth Aroon,\" \"Native Music,\" by Lover; McCann's\r\n\"O'Donnell Aboo!\" and others. \"Killarney,\" words by Falconer, music by\r\nBalfe, was sung by James McArdle, who had a fine tenor voice. Richard\r\nCampbell was our principal humorous singer. He used chiefly to give\r\nselections from Lover's songs, and one song written for him by John\r\nMcArdle, \"Pat Delany's Christenin'.\"\r\n\r\nJohn had an instinctive grasp of stage effect. A hint of the\r\npossibilities of an idea was enough for him. On my return from the\r\nCurragh I told him of how I had heard the militia men and soldiers\r\nsinging the \"Shan Van Vocht\" on the road. He decided that this should be\r\nour _finale_, the climax of the first part of our minstrel\r\nentertainment.\r\n\r\nWe had a drop scene representing the Lower Lake of Killarney. When it\r\nwas raised it disclosed the interior of the living room of a comfortable\r\nIrish homestead, with the large projecting open chimney, the turf fire\r\non the hearth, and the usual pious and patriotic pictures proper to such\r\nan interior--Terence's Fireside.\r\n\r\nOurs was a very self-contained company. Each had some special line as\r\nsinger, musician, elocutionist, story teller or dancer.\r\n\r\nJohn Clarke was our chief actor. He excelled in \"character parts,\" and,\r\nwhen well \"made up\" as an old man made a capital \"Terence\" in the first\r\npart of the entertainment, besides giving a fine rendering of Lefanu's\r\n\"Shemus O'Brien\" between the parts.\r\n\r\nIn the miscellaneous part there was a rattling Irish jig by Joseph Ward\r\nand Barry Aylmer. The latter, being of somewhat slight figure and a\r\ngood-looking youth, made a bouncing Irish colleen. These two made a\r\npoint of studying from nature, not only in their dancing, but in their\r\nacting and singing, so that their performances were always true to life,\r\nwithout an atom of exaggeration. They were always received with great\r\nenthusiasm, particularly by the old people, who seemed transported back,\r\nas by the touch of a magic wand, to the scenes of their youth.\r\n\r\nWe finished the evening with a sketch, written by John McArdle, called\r\n\"Phil Foley's Frolics\"--he was fond of alliteration. Noticing that\r\nJoseph Ward had made a special study of the comfortable old Irish\r\n_vanithee_, and had many of her quaint and humorous sayings, he added to\r\nthe characters a special part for him--\"Mrs. Casey,\"--to which he did\r\nfull justice. Indeed, so incessant was the laughter that followed each\r\nsally, that he and Barry Aylmer, who was the Phil Foley, sometimes found\r\nit difficult to get the words of the dialogue in between. We had\r\nanother sketch, \"Pat Houlahan's Ghost,\" which used to go very well.\r\n\r\nThe first part of the entertainment, showing old Terence in the chimney\r\ncorner and the others singing songs and telling stories, almost\r\nnecessitated our sitting around in a semi-circular formation. This gave\r\nus much the appearance of a nigger troupe. To depart from this somewhat,\r\nwe occasionally introduced a trifling plot. We made it that one of the\r\nsons of the house entered while the family were engaged in their usual\r\navocations, having unexpectedly returned from America. Then came the\r\naffectionate family greeting, and the bringing in of the friends and\r\nneighbours, who formed a group sitting around the turf fire, making a\r\nmerry night of it.\r\n\r\nThe services of the \"Emerald Minstrels\" were in great demand, and were\r\nalways cheerfully given for Catholic, National and charitable objects.\r\n\r\nWhile our own people mostly furnished our audiences, our entertainment\r\nwas appreciated by the general public. The best proof of this was that\r\nMr. Calderwood, Secretary of the Concert Hall, Lord Nelson Street, gave\r\nus several engagements for the \"Saturday Evening Concerts,\" in which,\r\nfrom time to time, Samuel Lover, Henry Russell, The English Glee and\r\nMadrigal Union, and other well-known popular entertainers, appeared. Mr.\r\nCalderwood told us he was well pleased to have in the town a company\r\nlike ours, upon whom he could always rely for a successful\r\nentertainment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nA FENIAN CONFERENCE AT PARIS--THE REVOLVERS FOR THE MANCHESTER\r\nRESCUE--MICHAEL DAVITT SENT TO PENAL SERVITUDE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have referred to Michael Breslin in speaking of his brother John.\r\nMichael was not suspected of any complicity with the revolutionary\r\nmovement until after the rising on the 5th of March, 1867, when he found\r\nit prudent to get out of the country.\r\n\r\nHe was, as the saying is, \"on his keeping,\" and stayed with me at my\r\nfather's house in Liverpool for a short time, until he found a\r\nfavourable opportunity of getting away to America. This was by no means\r\nan easy task, as all the ports were closely watched, and as, like his\r\nbrother John, he was a fine handsome man, of splendid physique, and well\r\nknown, of course, to the Irish police, it required all his caution\r\nsuccessfully to run the gauntlet; but this eventually he did.\r\n\r\nThe next I heard from him was that he was coming to Paris to a\r\nconference between the representatives of the two parties of American\r\nFenians--what were known as the Stephens and Roberts wings. Michael\r\nBreslin was sent as a representative of the Stephens party. There were\r\nprominent members of the I.R.B. in this country, also friends of\r\nBreslin, who were anxious that the two parties should join. I wrote to\r\nhim on their behalf, asking him to work towards that end. For greater\r\nsafety the letters for Breslin were sent under cover through my cousin,\r\nFather Bernard O'Loughlin, Superior of the Passionist Fathers in Paris.\r\nHe, of course, knew nothing of the nature of the communications he was\r\nhanding to Breslin, who did his best to bring about the desired unity;\r\nbut his action was repudiated by his principals in America.\r\n\r\nHe came over to England, and had a narrow escape from falling into the\r\nhands of the police. When William Hogan was arrested in Birmingham,\r\ncharged with supplying the arms used in the Manchester Rescue, Michael\r\nBreslin was in the house at the time. Questioned by the police, he\r\ndescribed himself as a traveller in the tea trade for Mr. James Lysaght\r\nFinigan, of Liverpool. As he had his proper credentials (samples, etc.,\r\nfrom James Finigan, who, anticipating an emergency of this kind, had\r\ngiven them for this express purpose), he was allowed by the police to go\r\non his way.\r\n\r\nJames Lysaght Finigan was a good type of the Liverpool-born Irishman,\r\neducated by the Christian Brothers. With other members of his family he\r\nwas at the time engaged in the tea trade; but he was of an adventurous\r\ndisposition, and afterwards served in the French Foreign Legion in the\r\nFranco-Prussian War. Later still he became a member of the Irish Party\r\nin the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nIn connection with Breslin's narrow escape, the sequel, as regards our\r\nfriend Hogan, is worth relating. Those who ever met William Hogan will\r\nagree with me that a more warm-hearted and enthusiastic Irishman never\r\nlived. He was a good-looking man, of imposing presence--a director of an\r\nInsurance Company, for which he was also the resident manager in\r\nBirmingham. Living in that town, he was of great assistance to the\r\nvarious agents entrusted with the task of procuring arms for the\r\nrevolutionary movement. It speaks much for his sagacity that a man of\r\nhis impulsive and generous temperament should so long have escaped\r\narrest in connection with such hazardous undertakings. Hogan, however,\r\nlike Shemus O'Brien, \"was taken at last.\"\r\n\r\nSome of the revolvers brought from Birmingham by Daniel Darragh, which\r\nhad been used at the Hyde Road action, had been picked up from the\r\nground afterwards by the police. It was for supplying these that Hogan\r\nwas put upon his trial. The maker of the revolvers was brought from\r\nBirmingham, and put in the witness box. He swore that a revolver\r\nproduced was one of his own make, which he had sold to the prisoner.\r\nThus, fortunately for Hogan, the whole case against him turned on this\r\npoint--not a very strong one, as it was obviously possible for the Crown\r\nwitness to be mistaken.\r\n\r\nHogan's counsel produced a similar revolver, and asked the witness if he\r\ncould identify it as his manufacture? The witness unhesitatingly did so.\r\nThe counsel, when his turn came, called another witness--a\r\ndecent-looking man of the artizan class. The barrister handed him the\r\nrevolver.\r\n\r\n\"Do you recognise it?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"I do--I made it myself.\"\r\n\r\nThe Court was astonished. The prosecuting counsel asked:--\r\n\r\n\"How do you know it is yours?\"\r\n\r\n\"By certain marks on it,\" the man replied, and these he proceeded to\r\ndescribe. As the description was found to be correct, and as the other\r\nwitness, who had sworn that _he_ had made the weapon, had not described\r\nany such marks, the case against Hogan broke down, and he was acquitted.\r\n\r\nA few days afterwards he called on me, and explained how the thing had\r\nhappened. When he was arrested, his friends in Birmingham, having still\r\non hand some of the revolvers he had purchased, had an exact copy of one\r\nof them made by a gunsmith whom they could trust, with instructions to\r\nput his own private marks upon it, which he could afterwards identify.\r\nIt was this weapon that had deceived the witness for the prosecution to\r\nsuch an extent that he wrongly swore to it as being his own manufacture.\r\n\r\nDaniel Darragh, who was also put upon his trial for supplying the\r\nweapons for the Manchester Rescue, was not so fortunate as his friend\r\nHogan, for he was convicted. He was sent into penal servitude on April\r\n15th, 1869, but, being in delicate health, did not long survive, for he\r\ndied in Portland Prison on June 28th of the following year. William\r\nHogan, as the fulfilment of a sacred duty, brought the body of his\r\nfriend home to Ireland, to be buried among his own kith and kin, in the\r\nCatholic cemetery of Ballycastle, Co. Antrim; and Edward O'Meagher\r\nCondon, when recently visiting this country, considered it a no less\r\nsacred duty to visit the grave.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that William Hogan, with all his acuteness, had a very\r\nnarrow escape from falling into the hands of the law and suffering its\r\npenalties. Still, it has been my experience, that men like him, who have\r\nstood their ground, following their usual legitimate occupations, were\r\nalways less liable to be molested than what might be termed birds of\r\npassage, such as Rickard Burke, Arthur Forrester, or Michael Davitt.\r\n\r\nSuch, I consider, was the case of my friend, John Barry, when he was a\r\nresident in Newcastle-on-Tyne, in connection with an incident which he\r\nrelated to me a short time since. Some arms were addressed to him \"to be\r\ncalled for,\" under the name of \"Kershaw,\" a well-known north-country\r\nname, not at all likely to be borne by an Irishman. By some means the\r\npolice got wind of the nature of the consignment, and the arms were held\r\nat the station, waiting for Mr. Kershaw to claim them. But it was a case\r\nof plot and counterplot; and when John was actually on the way to the\r\nrailway station, he was warned in time by a railway employé, an Irish\r\nProtestant member of the I.R.B., and did not finish his journey. As\r\n\"Kershaw\" did not turn up, the case of arms was sent off to London to be\r\nproduced at a trial then impending.\r\n\r\n_John Barry_ was at that time a commercial traveller, and, strangely\r\nenough, on one of his trips, he found himself in the same railway\r\ncarriage with two detectives who were in charge of the arms on their way\r\nto the metropolis. John, as everybody acquainted with him knows, \"has\r\nthe music on the tip of his tongue;\" the racy accent acquired in his\r\nchildhood in his native Wexford. But he can put it off when the occasion\r\nrequires it; and the two police officers were quite charmed with the\r\nsocial qualities of the genial commercial \"gent\" who was their\r\nfellow-traveller, never suspecting him to be an Irishman. They chatted\r\ntogether in the most agreeable manner, making no secret of their mission\r\nto London, and letting drop a few facts which proved useful to the\r\ncounsel for the defence in the subsequent trial. Reaching London, they\r\nasked the commercial \"gent\" to spend a social evening with them and some\r\nof the witnesses in the case, which had some connection with the arms\r\nintended for \"Mr. Kershaw.\" He could not do so, he said, as he had a\r\nprevious engagement--which happened to be with Arthur Forrester and some\r\nwitnesses on the other side. But, he continued, he would be glad to see\r\nthem on the following day. Where could he see them? At Scotland Yard;\r\nand at Scotland Yard, accordingly, he met them, where they showed him,\r\nas an evidence of the desperate characters they had to deal with--his\r\nown case of arms!\r\n\r\nThey told him of the pleasant evening he had missed, the only drawback\r\nbeing, they said, that one of the witnesses, named Corydon, got drunk\r\nand was very troublesome.\r\n\r\nThis reminds me of another case, in connection with which I, at the\r\ntime, fully expected to be arrested. The reader can form his own\r\nconclusion, but my impression was, and is, that I owed my safety to a\r\ngentleman I shall now introduce. Detective Superintendent Laurence\r\nKehoe, of Liverpool, was a very decent man in his way. He was by no\r\nmeans of the type of John Boyle O'Reilly or the Breslins, who have shown\r\nthat in the British army and in the police force there have been men,\r\nmostly compelled by adverse circumstances, who have for a time worn the\r\nblue, or green, or scarlet coat of Britain without changing the Irish\r\nheart beneath.\r\n\r\nNo; Larry (as he was generally called) was nothing of the kind. Still, I\r\nbelieve he faithfully did his duty according to his lights, in the\r\nservice in which he was engaged. He was a conscientious Catholic, and a\r\nson of his is a most respected priest in the diocese of Liverpool. He\r\nwas a kind-hearted, charitable man, always ready to do a good turn,\r\nparticularly for a fellow-countryman. If an Irish policeman called his\r\nattention to some poor waif of an Irish child who had lost its parents,\r\nor was in evil surroundings--having parents worse than none, or in\r\ndanger of losing its faith--Laurence Kehoe would take the matter in\r\nhand. He would not always go through the formality of bringing the case\r\nof such child under the notice of the managers of one or other of the\r\nCatholic orphanages. When I was Secretary of Father Nugent's Boys'\r\nRefuge, he brought one of these waifs to the Brother Director, and\r\nclaimed admittance for him. The place was full, the Brother said--it\r\ncould not be done. Without another word Kehoe left the child on the\r\ndoorstep, and simply saying, \"Good-night,\" left Brother Tertullian\r\nsorely perplexed, but with no alternative but to take the child in.\r\n\r\nNow, Laurence Kehoe must have known that I was a notorious suspect--for\r\nit was his duty to know--but we were good friends, never, however,\r\ntalking politics by any possible chance. I cannot, of course, state for\r\ncertain how it was, but the reader, from what I am going to describe,\r\nmay possibly come to the conclusion that Detective Superintendent Kehoe\r\nmay have shut both eyes and ears in my particular case.\r\n\r\nTo Rickard Burke was entrusted the critical and dangerous task of buying\r\nand distributing arms for the revolutionary movement. _Exit_ Rickard\r\nBurke, in the usual way, through the prison gate. _Enter_ Arthur\r\nForrester, who, in due course, found his way also--though but for a\r\nshort time--within prison walls. Then, following in quick succession,\r\ncame Michael Davitt, engaged in the same task as Burke and Forrester.\r\n\r\nForrester was a young man of great eloquence, and, like his mother and\r\nsister, a poet. Mrs. Ellen Forrester's \"Widow's Message to her Son\" is,\r\nI think, one of the finest and most heart-stirring poems we possess. I\r\nhave often listened with pleasure to Arthur Forrester, when he used to\r\ncome to address the \"boys\" in Liverpool. On one of those occasions\r\nMichael Davitt was with him, a modest, unassuming young man, with but\r\nlittle to say, although he was to make afterwards a more important\r\nfigure in the world than his friend. Forrester was a young fellow full\r\nof pluck, and made a desperate resistance when, a boy, he was first\r\narrested in Dublin.\r\n\r\nOne night, just before Christmas, 1869, he left fifty revolvers with me.\r\nEarly next morning I read in a daily paper that he had been arrested the\r\nprevious night in a Temperance Hotel where he had been staying. There\r\nwere no arms found upon him or among his belongings. He had left them\r\nwith me;--indeed, as I read the account of his arrest, they were still\r\nin my possession. You may depend upon it I quickly got them into safer\r\nhands than my own. Some compromising documents were found in Forrester's\r\npossession, including a certain letter with which Michael Davitt's name\r\nwas connected. This same letter was brought forward in evidence some\r\nyears afterwards, in the famous \"_Times_ Forgeries Commission,\" with a\r\nview to showing that the Irish leaders had incited to murder. As I\r\nexpected, I was not long without a visit from Laurence Kehoe's\r\nlieutenants. Horn and Cousens, detective officers, called upon me to\r\nmake enquiries about the revolvers which, they said, \"Arthur had left\r\nwith me.\" I need scarcely say they gained nothing by their visitation. I\r\nfully expected that the matter would not end here, and that I was likely\r\nto find myself in the dock along with Forrester.\r\n\r\nThe same evening I had a visit from my sister-in-law, Miss Naughton.\r\nShe had a friend, a Miss Cameron, who was sister to the wife of Lawrence\r\nKehoe. Miss Cameron lived in the house of the Detective Superintendent,\r\nalong with her sister, Mrs. Kehoe. In the middle of the previous\r\nnight--Miss Cameron told Miss Naughton--her room being on the same\r\nlanding as Kehoe's--she heard him called, and a man's voice saying:--\r\n\r\n\"We've taken Forrester. Shall we go to Denvir?\" There was a pause; then\r\nKehoe said, \"No,\" adding some words to the effect that he did not think\r\nthat I was implicated.\r\n\r\nI dare say, after the manner of some pious people I know, he had\r\npersuaded himself that such was the case. After he had worked out his\r\nfull term in Purgatory (for he is dead many years, God rest his soul!),\r\nI don't think St. Peter can have kept the Heavenly gates closed on Larry\r\nKehoe for whatever he said about me that night. Nay, let us hope that it\r\nwas even put down to his credit.\r\n\r\nForrester's explanation, when he was arrested, as to his employment was\r\nthat he was a hawker. He had his licence, all quite regular, to show.\r\nUnder this he could sell his revolvers. There was nothing illegal in\r\nthat, unless a connection were established with the revolutionary\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\nThis, it appeared, they were not able to make out; but he was kept in\r\ncustody, evidently with a view to gain time to establish such a\r\nconnection. In fact, his case was the same as Davitt's, who took up the\r\nwork of procuring and distributing arms, after Forrester had become too\r\nwell known to the police in connection with it. Davitt, too, had a\r\nhawker's licence; and, at first, there was really no evidence to connect\r\nhim with the Fenian movement. The farce was gone through of bringing\r\nCorydon to identify him--not a very difficult task in the case of a\r\none-armed man--though this was the first time Corydon had ever seen\r\nDavitt.\r\n\r\nThe evident explanation of Forrester being kept in custody, and\r\nremanded, as he was, from day to day, without being charged with any\r\noffence, was that a similar connection might be established, to prove\r\nwhich a little perjury would not stand in the way.\r\n\r\nMichael Davitt, who had not yet come under the notice of the police,\r\ncame to me, along with Arthur Forrester's mother, on hearing of the\r\narrest. They had tea with us, and, I need scarcely say, were warmly\r\nwelcomed in our little family circle, those in the house who were but\r\nsmall children then being in after years proud to remember that they had\r\nhad such noble characters under their roof.\r\n\r\nMrs. Ellen Forrester was a homely, sweet-looking, little North of\r\nIreland woman. She was a native of the County Monaghan, and, at this\r\ntime, about forty years of age. Her maiden name was Magennis. Her father\r\nwas a schoolmaster, which would, no doubt, account for her literary\r\ntastes. Songs and poems of hers appeared in the \"Nation\" and \"Dundalk\r\nDemocrat.\" She was quite young when she came to England, and settled\r\nfirst in Liverpool, and then in Manchester. She married Michael\r\nForrester, a stonemason, and had five children. It was quite evident\r\nthere was a poetic strain in the Magennis blood, for two of her\r\ndaughters, and her son Arthur, inherited the gift, which her brother\r\nBernard also possessed. She produced \"Simple Strains\" and (in\r\nconjunction with her son Arthur) \"Songs of the Rising Nation,\" and other\r\npoems. She was a frequent contributor to the English press, her work\r\nbeing much appreciated.\r\n\r\nArthur Forrester, whose release we were trying to effect, was, at this\r\ntime, only nineteen years old, though he looked much older. Besides the\r\npoetic strain which he inherited from his mother, he must also have had\r\nthat fiery and unconquerable spirit which displayed itself in the\r\ndetermined resistance he made against the police who came to arrest him\r\nin 1867, in Dublin, where he had found his way for the projected rising.\r\nHe was a young Revolutionist truly--being then only seventeen. He was\r\nnot long kept in prison that time, there being no evidence to connect\r\nhim with Fenianism, nor, indeed, was there now, when he had fallen into\r\nthe hands of the police in Liverpool, though they were doing their best\r\nto manufacture some.\r\n\r\nHis warlike proclivities seem to have been ever uppermost, as will be\r\nseen later, where we find him joining the French \"Foreign Legion\" during\r\nthe Franco-Prussian War. Besides the \"Songs of the Rising Nation\" in\r\nconnection with his mother, he produced \"An Irish Crazy Quilt,\" prose\r\nand verse, and was a frequent contributor to the \"Irish People\" and\r\nother papers over the signature of \"Angus\" and \"William Tell.\"\r\n\r\nIt is too bad of me to be keeping poor Arthur in durance vile while I\r\nam going into these particulars; but I want to show what kind of people\r\nthese Forresters were, and what the rebelly Ulster Magennis strain in\r\ntheir blood let them into.\r\n\r\nTogether, Davitt and I called upon several Liverpool Irishmen to get\r\nbail for Forrester. There was no difficulty--we could easily get the\r\nnecessary security; but, name after name, good, substantial bail, was\r\nrefused by the police on one pretence or another.\r\n\r\nUltimately, on Christmas Eve, when the prisoner was again brought before\r\nthe stipendiary magistrate, Mr. Raffles, a very just and high-minded\r\nman, Dr. Commins, barrister, acting for Forrester, claimed that no\r\ncharge, but a mere matter of suspicion, being forthcoming against him,\r\nthe bail offered should be accepted. The magistrate agreed to accept two\r\nsureties of £100 each, \"to keep the peace for one year,\" and Arthur\r\nForrester was released.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to know that while one of the bails was William\r\nRussell, a patriotic Irishman, having an extensive business, the other\r\nwas Arthur Doran, a wholesale newsagent. He was a decent Irishman, of\r\nLiverpool birth, who took no part in politics. He had been induced to go\r\nbail by one of the greatest scoundrels Ireland ever produced--Richard\r\nPigott, Doran being an agent for Pigott's papers, the \"Irishman\" and\r\n\"Flag of Ireland.\" Let this one good act, at all events, be put down to\r\nPigott's credit.\r\n\r\nTo return to Forrester. After such a close shave as he had in\r\nLiverpool, with the eyes of the police now upon him, his occupation was\r\ngone, and Michael Davitt took up the work. I am afraid that Davitt's\r\nvisit to Liverpool on this occasion brought him under the notice of the\r\npolice, and may probably have led to his arrest a few months afterwards.\r\n\r\nThis took place on May 14th, 1870, at Paddington Station, London, with\r\nhim being arrested also John Wilson, a Birmingham gunsmith. Davitt had\r\n£150 in his possession, and Wilson had fifty revolvers, it being\r\nsuggested that the gunsmith was about to deliver the weapons in exchange\r\nfor the money. So far--Davitt having a hawker's licence, as in the case\r\nof Forrester--this would have been perfectly legitimate. What was wanted\r\nby the authorities was evidence to show a connection with the Fenian\r\nconspiracy. They really had no such evidence, but as Davitt was a marked\r\nman, and as it was necessary to have him removed, Corydon was brought to\r\nidentify him, and, of course, had no difficulty, when a number of men\r\nwere brought into the corridor, in picking out the one-armed man from\r\namong them.\r\n\r\nAt the trial Corydon swore, among other things, that Davitt took part in\r\nthe Chester raid. Now, Michael himself told me afterwards that Corydon\r\nhad never seen him before he \"identified\" him in prison; and that though\r\nhe really was at Chester, Corydon could not have known this. Michael\r\nDavitt and John Wilson were convicted of treason-felony. As showing the\r\nman's noble character, it should not be forgotten that the Irishman made\r\nan earnest appeal for the Englishman, declaring that Wilson knew\r\nnothing of the object for which the weapons were wanted, and asking that\r\nwhatever sentence was to be passed on the gunsmith might be added to his\r\nown. This was quite worthy of Davitt's chivalrous and unselfish nature,\r\nand I can well imagine his tall and commanding figure in the dock, with\r\nhis strongly marked features and dark, bright eyes--while utterly\r\ndefiant of what the law might do to himself--making this appeal for the\r\nman who stood beside him. Davitt was, on July 11th, 1870, sentenced to\r\nfifteen years, and Wilson to seven years penal servitude.\r\n\r\nMichael Davitt will appear in these pages as the founder of another\r\norganisation, the results of which seem likely to make the Irish people\r\nmore the real possessors of their own soil than they have ever been\r\nsince the Norman invasion.\r\n\r\nAbout this time I had started a printing and publishing business in\r\nLiverpool, and commenced to realise what I had long projected as a\r\nuseful work for Ireland. This was the issue of my \"Irish Library,\"\r\nconsisting chiefly of penny books of biographies, stories, songs, and\r\nstirring episodes of Irish history.\r\n\r\nIn their production and afterwards, when I continued the issue of these\r\nbooklets in London, I had valuable assistance from various friends,\r\nincluding Rev. Father Ambrose, Rev. Father O'Laverty, Michael Davitt,\r\nDaniel Crilly, T.D. Sullivan, Timothy McSweeney, Hugh Heinrick, William\r\nJ. Ryan, Francis Fahy, William P. Ryan, Alfred Perceval Graves, Michael\r\nO'Mahony, John J. Sheehan, Thomas Boyd, Thomas Flannery, John Hand,\r\nJames Lysaght Finigan, and other well-known writers on Irish subjects.\r\nSome of the penny books were from my own pen, in addition to which I\r\nwrote \"The Brandons,\" a story of Irish life in England, and other books,\r\nof which my most ambitious work was \"The Irish in Britain.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nRESCUE OF THE MILITARY FENIANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore concluding the section of my Recollections connected with\r\nFenianism, I must re-introduce John Breslin, the rescuer of James\r\nStephens.\r\n\r\nThough the episode I am about to describe took place some six years\r\nafter the commencement of the constitutional Home Rule agitation, I\r\nthink it well, as it was connected with Fenianism, for the sake of\r\ncompactness, to introduce it here.\r\n\r\nMy excuse for introducing it as part of _my_ recollections will be seen\r\nfurther on.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that John Breslin, when a warder in Richmond\r\nPrison, was the man who actually opened the door of James Stephens's\r\ncell, and, with the aid of Byrne, another warder, helped the Head Centre\r\nover the prison wall, and left him in charge of John Ryan and other\r\nfriends outside.\r\n\r\nIt was no wonder, then, that, when a similar perilous and even more\r\narduous undertaking was projected, John Breslin should be the man chosen\r\nas the chief instrument to carry it out.\r\n\r\nThis was the rescue of six military Fenians from Freemantle, in Western\r\nAustralia, which was ultimately effected on Easter Monday, 17th April,\r\n1876.\r\n\r\nThe enterprise was projected in America, among its most active\r\npromoters being John Devoy. Associated with him were John Boyle O'Reilly\r\n(himself an escaped Fenian convict) and Captain Hathaway, City Marshal\r\nof New Bedford. An American barque, of 202 tons, the _Catalpa_, was\r\nbought, and converted into a whaler, but was intended to be used in\r\ncarrying off the convicts. She was ready for sea in March, 1875. It was\r\nmore than a year before she took the prisoners away from Australia, and\r\na further four months before she reached New York with the rescued men.\r\nThe ship was taken out by Captain S. Anthony, an American, to whom was\r\nconfided the object of the mission. The only Irishman on board among the\r\ncrew was Denis Duggan, the carpenter, a sterling Nationalist, to whom\r\nalso was made known the mission on which they were bound.\r\n\r\nAs John Breslin was now in America, obviously he was the man of all\r\nothers to entrust with the command of the daring project of carrying off\r\nthe prisoners. Happily he was available for the work, and entered into\r\nit heartily. He sent me the narrative of the rescue himself--through his\r\nbrother Michael--on his return to America, after having successfully\r\naccomplished his mission.\r\n\r\nHe and Captain Desmond sailed from San Francisco on the 13th of\r\nSeptember, 1875, and reached Freemantle on 16th of November. They were\r\nnot long in opening up communications with the prisoners, so as to be in\r\nreadiness for the arrival of the _Catalpa_. In the meantime two more men\r\njoined the expedition--John King, who brought a supply of money from\r\nNew Zealand, which was most useful, and Thomas Brennan, who arrived at\r\nthe last moment, just as the _Catalpa_ appeared off the coast, and had\r\ngot into communication with Breslin.\r\n\r\nEverything being arranged, it was determined to carry off the following\r\nprisoners--Martin Harrington, Thomas Darragh, James Wilson, Martin\r\nJoseph Hogan, Robert Cranston, and Thomas Henry Hassett. They were at\r\nwork outside the prison walls, or at other employment equally\r\naccessible, when they were taken away in two traps from Freemantle,\r\nabout nine o'clock in the morning of the 17th of April, 1876. By the\r\ntime the news of their flight, and of the direction they had taken, was\r\nknown in the prison, the party had reached Rockingham, and were on the\r\nsea in the whale-boat which was to take them to the _Catalpa_.\r\n\r\nThe gunboat _Conflict_, which was usually stationed at King George's\r\nSound, was telegraphed for by the authorities, but it was found that the\r\nwires had been cut the previous night, and by the time they were\r\nrepaired the vessel had gone on a cruise.\r\n\r\nAfter some hours' delay, the governor engaged the passenger steamer\r\n_Georgette_ to go in pursuit. It was nine o'clock that evening before\r\nshe left Freemantle. The police boat was cruising about also, looking\r\nfor the whaler and her boat. The _Georgette_ came up with the _Catalpa_\r\nabout 8 o'clock on the following (Tuesday) morning. A demand to go on\r\nboard and search the barque was refused. As it was found there was a\r\nshort supply aboard the _Georgette_, she returned to Freemantle to coal,\r\nleaving the police boat to watch the _Catalpa_, and to look out for the\r\nwhale boat containing the rescued men, which had not yet appeared,\r\nalthough, as it turned out, not far off at the time. The boat had been\r\nvainly searching for the _Catalpa_ all night, and had only now\r\ndiscovered her. The party in the boat had actually seen the _Georgette_\r\noverhauling the _Catalpa_, and had yet themselves remained undiscovered.\r\nIn order to keep clear of falling into the hands of the _Georgette_ they\r\nstood off from the ship, and it was about half-past two o'clock in the\r\nafternoon before the boat containing the rescued men approached the\r\n_Catalpa_ again. They then saw the police boat making for the ship at\r\nabout the same distance from her on the land side as the whale boat was\r\nto the seaward. The men scrambled aboard just as the police boat was\r\ncoming up on the other side.\r\n\r\nBreslin says:--\"As soon as my feet struck the deck over the quarter\r\nrail, Mr. Smith, the first mate, called out to me, 'What shall I do now,\r\nMr. Collins (this was the name Breslin went by); what shall I do?' I\r\nreplied, 'Hoist the flag, and stand out to sea;' and never was a\r\nmanoeuvre executed in a more prompt and seamanlike manner.\"\r\n\r\nThe police boat did not attempt to board the vessel, but made its way\r\nback to Freemantle to report. There the _Georgette_ had been fully\r\ncoaled and provisioned, and had taken aboard, in addition to the\r\npensioners and police, a twelve-pounder field-piece. At 11 o'clock the\r\nsame night (Tuesday) she steamed out once more. At daylight on the\r\nfollowing morning she came up with the _Catalpa_ again, and fired a\r\nround shot across her bows. After some parleying, Captain Anthony being\r\nprompted by Breslin, the _Georgette_ hailed that if the _Catalpa_ did\r\nnot heave to, the masts would be blown out of her.\r\n\r\n\"Tell them,\" said Breslin to the captain, \"that's the American flag; you\r\nare on the high seas; and if he fires on the ship, he fires on the\r\nAmerican flag.\"\r\n\r\nPreparations were made to give the armed party on the _Georgette_ a warm\r\nreception should they attempt to board the whaler. But the pursuers had\r\na wholesome fear of coming into conflict with a vessel sailing under the\r\nStars and Stripes, and, after some further parleying, left the _Catalpa_\r\nto pursue her homeward voyage unmolested.\r\n\r\nI was fortunate enough to get the account of _both_ expeditions--for\r\nthere were two--for the rescue of the military Fenians in each case\r\ndirect from the man having the command.\r\n\r\nI have already given John Breslin's account, which, it will, perhaps, be\r\nremembered I published at the time as a number of my penny \"Irish\r\nLibrary.\"\r\n\r\nI had the pleasure of hearing John Walsh, who had charge of the\r\nexpedition from this country, relating the part he and his friend bore\r\nin assisting the Irish-American rescuers. He told the story at a very\r\nselect gathering in Liverpool, at which I was present. On the 13th of\r\nJanuary, he said, two men, of whom he was one, left this country with\r\nmoney and clothing to carry out the rescue. They landed on the 28th of\r\nFebruary at King George's Sound, whence a sailing vessel took them to\r\nFreemantle.\r\n\r\nThey soon got into communication with the two men who had come from\r\nAmerica, and had been on the spot since November, 1875--John Breslin and\r\nJ. Desmond, the latter of whom worked as a coach-builder at Perth. Walsh\r\nand his friend offered their co-operation to the men from America in any\r\ncapacity, and arrangements were made accordingly. They lent the\r\nAmericans arms, and they cut the telegraph wires from Perth to King\r\nGeorge's Sound, where a man-of-war was stationed.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from Breslin's account that this was why the man-of-war\r\nwas not available to deal with the _Catalpa_; for when the telegraphic\r\ncommunication was restored, it was found that the gunboat _Conflict_ had\r\nleft on a cruise.\r\n\r\nWalsh and his friend were on the ground on the morning when the\r\nprisoners started to escape, and if a fight took place, they were to\r\nfight and fly with their friends. If there was no fight, they were to\r\nremain behind. If the _Catalpa_ failed, they were to fly to the bush,\r\nwith the exception of some who were to remain behind to succour those in\r\nthe bush.\r\n\r\nJohn Walsh described how, when the rescued men were being driven in two\r\ntraps from Freemantle to Rockingham, to be taken on the whale-boat to\r\nthe _Catalpa_, which was lying off the coast awaiting them, he and his\r\nfriend started with them, and remained behind to stop pursuit. He also\r\ndescribed the attempt to recapture the escaped men, as told in Breslin's\r\nnarrative, and how the attempt failed.\r\n\r\nMy own connection with this incident was that the funds, or some part\r\nof them, for John Walsh's expedition passed through my hands between\r\ntheir collection and their distribution.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, August 21st, 1876, while we were holding the Annual\r\nConvention of the Home Rule Confederation of Great Britain, in the\r\nRotunda, Dublin, the joyful news reached us that the _Catalpa_, having\r\non board the rescued men and their rescuers, had safely reached New\r\nYork. The news was received with the wildest enthusiasm. The terrible\r\nstrain of the last four months had passed, and we were relieved from the\r\nconstant dread that, after the gallant rescue, the men might again fall\r\ninto the hands of the enemy.\r\n\r\nA few more words about the Breslins before finishing this chapter.\r\nMichael went back to America after his escape from arrest in Birmingham.\r\nI have corresponded with him from time to time ever since. A letter of\r\nmine to Michael, written after he finally went to America, came back to\r\nme in a very curious manner. A gentleman came into my place of business\r\nin Liverpool one day, and presented to me, as an introduction, a letter\r\nI had sent to my friend about a month previously. I was somewhat\r\nsuspicious about this. I told him there was nothing to show that my\r\nletter had ever been in Breslin's hands at all. The gentleman agreed\r\nthat I was right, and said he would merely ask to be allowed to leave\r\nhis luggage for a short time.\r\n\r\nI got a careful watch kept on his movements in Liverpool, but nothing\r\nmore suspicious was reported than that he had been seen to enter a\r\nCatholic church, where he had gone to Confession.\r\n\r\nMy friend William Hogan was in my place when my messenger returned, and\r\nwhen he heard this, exclaimed, in his usual impetuous style--\"He's a\r\nspy!\"\r\n\r\nThe deduction might not seem obvious, but, doubtless Hogan had in his\r\nmind one or two of the worst cases of the anti-Fenian informers, who\r\nmade a parade of great piety a cloak for their treachery.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman returned and reclaimed his luggage, and I heard nothing\r\nfurther of him for about a month afterwards, when I had a letter from\r\nMichael Breslin, saying that his friend, whom I had treated with such\r\nsuspicion and such scant hospitality, was Mr. John B. Holland, the\r\nfamous submarine inventor. He was, I believe, in this country in\r\nconnection with his invention.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked, after all, what did Fenianism do for Ireland? To those\r\nwho ask the question I would answer that no honest effort for liberty\r\nhas ever been made in vain. If Fenianism did nothing else, it kept alive\r\nthe tradition and the spirit of freedom among Irishmen, and handed them\r\non to the next generation. In so far as the men who took part in it were\r\nunselfish, were whole-souled lovers of their country, and prepared to\r\nrisk life and liberty for their country's sake--and I think with pride\r\nof the thousands of such men I knew or knew of--then the whole Irish\r\nrace was ennobled and lifted up from the mire of serfdom.\r\n\r\nBut it did more than merely make martyrs. Its strength, its spontaneity,\r\nand the devotion of its adherents were such that they undoubtedly\r\nawakened not merely some alarm, but also some sense of justice in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nGladstone admitted that what first prompted him to set in motion the\r\nmovement for the disestablishment of the Irish Church was \"the intensity\r\nof Fenianism.\" But the result did not end there. For many an Englishman\r\nwas moved to the belief that surely there must be something wrong with a\r\nsystem which provoked such a movement, something not wholly bad about a\r\ncause for which men went with calm, proud confidence to the felon's cell\r\nor the scaffold. And, even to-day, England--with all her secret service\r\nfacilities--does not know one-half of the danger from which she escaped;\r\nnor can I repeat much of what I myself could say of Fenianism in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nThere are men who have made large fortunes in business; there are\r\neminent men in many of the professions, whose former connection with\r\nFenianism is unsuspected, who, at the time, if the call had been made\r\nupon them, would cheerfully have thrown aside their careers and taken\r\ntheir places in the ranks.\r\n\r\nOnce again \"a soul came into Ireland,\" and men were capable then of high\r\nenterprises which to-day seem to belong to another age.\r\n\r\nEven for myself, I have many times marvelled how light-heartedly in\r\nthose days I took the risks of conspiracy--how little it troubled me\r\nthat there were dozens of men who bore my liberty, and perhaps my life,\r\nin their hands. But I never doubted them--and I was right!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTHE HOME RULE MOVEMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt now becomes my business to record the formation and progress of\r\nanother organisation--one which appealed to me precisely on the same\r\ngrounds as Fenianism, namely, first, that it was based on justice; and,\r\nsecondly, that it was practicable.\r\n\r\nThis was the constitutional movement for what was known as Home Rule. My\r\nprinciples have never altered, and I can see nothing inconsistent in my\r\nadapting myself to changed conditions. I and those who thought like me\r\nwere driven into Fenianism because it seemed likely to achieve success,\r\nand what was call \"constitutional agitation\" seemed hopeless. Now the\r\nposition was reversed. On the one hand Fenianism had collapsed, and on\r\nthe other there seemed a prospect, partly owing to the change wrought by\r\nFenianism, that a constitutional movement might succeed.\r\n\r\nThis constitutional movement had been going on for some six years\r\nprevious to the rescue of the military Fenians, having been inaugurated\r\nat a meeting in the Bilton Hotel, Dublin, on the 19th May, 1870, five\r\ndays after the arrest of Michael Davitt, and his disappearance for a\r\nseason from the stage of Irish history.\r\n\r\nIn the pages which are to follow I shall have occasion to introduce\r\nsome of those who took part in that first Home Rule gathering in Dublin.\r\nIt was a hopeful beginning, as there were assembled men who were of\r\nvarious creeds and politics--Catholics, Protestants, Fenian\r\nsympathisers, Repealers, Liberals, and Tories--but all of whom had in\r\nview the happiness and prosperity of their common country. There they\r\nestablished the \"Home Government Association of Ireland,\" the first\r\nresolution passed being:--\r\n\r\n     This Association is formed for the purpose of attaining for Ireland\r\n     the right of self-government by means of a National Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe fact was that the \"intensity of Fenianism\" had forced thinking men\r\nof every shade of opinion to realise that government of Ireland by\r\noutsiders was an abject failure. Even Englishmen themselves began to\r\nrealise that they were engaged in an impossible task, or, at all events,\r\none in which they were quite at sea. A humorous story is attributed to\r\nMr. T.W. Russell on this point. It is that a certain Englishman, who was\r\nappointed Chief Secretary for Ireland, went to an English official of\r\nexperience in Dublin, and said--\r\n\r\n\"You know what I mean to do first of all, is to get at the facts--the\r\nfacts--then I shall be on sure ground.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear sir,\" said the official wearily, \"there are no facts in\r\nIreland.\"\r\n\r\nThe conclusion was not a surprising one for a man who had for years\r\nbeen in touch with the \"official sources\" of information.\r\n\r\nWhile all honour is due to the men who initiated the new movement, the\r\nnames of those who carried on the constitutional struggle during the\r\nyears that preceded this date should not be forgotten. Of all the men I\r\never came into contact with in the course of my experience of\r\nconstitutional agitation, I think the Sullivans--especially T.D. and\r\nA.M.--deserve the most credit, for they kept the flag flying in the\r\ncolumns of the \"Nation\" and in other ways during all the gloomy years\r\nthat followed after Charles Gavan Duffy left the country in despair. I\r\nam always proud to have reckoned these two men among my dearest and most\r\ntrusted friends.\r\n\r\nAnother great admirer of the Sullivans was Alfred Crilly, brother to\r\nDaniel Crilly, and father of Frederick Lucas Crilly, the present\r\nrespected and able General Secretary of the United Irish League of Great\r\nBritain. Alfred was one of the most brilliant Irishmen we ever had in\r\nLiverpool, and no man did better service for the cause in that city\r\nduring his lifetime. It was always a pleasure to me to work in harness\r\nwith him, as I did on many public occasions; for whatever was the\r\nnational organisation going on in Ireland for the time being we\r\ntwo--Alfred Crilly and myself--always did our best to have its\r\ncounterpart in Liverpool. Indeed it became the case that for many years\r\nour people there invariably looked to us to take the initiative in every\r\nnational movement. Whenever A.M. Sullivan came over to our\r\ndemonstrations it did not need our assurance to convince him that every\r\npulsation of the national heart in Ireland was as warmly and as strongly\r\nfelt on this side of the Channel as though we still formed part of our\r\nmother island. Indeed, the evidence of his own eyes, the enthusiasm he\r\nsaw when he came amongst us, caused him to declare at a vast gathering\r\nin the Amphitheatre that he felt as if he were not out of Ireland at\r\nall, but on a piece cut from the \"old sod\" itself.\r\n\r\nI felt proud when two young men of my training, John McArdle, who had\r\nbeen with me on the \"Catholic Times\"; and afterwards Daniel Crilly, on\r\nthe \"United Irishman,\" were appointed to the literary staff of the\r\n\"Nation,\" for which they were well fitted, seeing that, with their\r\nbrilliant gifts, they had, from their earliest days, been imbued with\r\nthe doctrines of that newspaper.\r\n\r\nT.D., like his brother, often came to Liverpool, and used to be equally\r\ndelighted with the enthusiastic receptions he got from his\r\nfellow-countrymen. On one occasion he said to me he was at a loss how to\r\nshow his appreciation. I told him how to do this. \"Write us a song,\" I\r\nsaid. He did so; and with that admirable tact which is so characteristic\r\nof him he chose for his theme--\"Erin's Sons in England,\" a song which,\r\nwritten to the air of \"The Shamrock,\" has, for many years, been sung at\r\nour Irish festivals in Great Britain. As a personal favour to myself he\r\nwrote it for one of the penny books of my \"Irish Library\".\r\n\r\nI need make no apology for introducing T.D. Sullivan's song here. It\r\nwill be seen that he sings our praise with no uncertain note; and, in\r\nreturn, I may say on their behalf that he had no warmer admirers than\r\namong the Irish of England.\r\n\r\n    ERIN'S SONS IN ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n   _Air--\"Oh, the Shamrock_.\"\r\n\r\n  On every shore, the wide world o'er,\r\n    The newest and the oldest,\r\n  The sons are found of Erin's ground\r\n    Among the best and boldest.\r\n  But soul and will are turning still\r\n    To Ireland o'er the ocean,\r\n  And well I know where aye they glow\r\n    With most intense devotion.\r\n\r\n  CHORUS:--Over here in England,\r\n           Up and down through England,\r\n             Fond and true and fearless too,\r\n           Are Erin's sons in England.\r\n\r\n  Where toil is hard, in mill and yard,\r\n    Their hands are strong to bear it;\r\n  Where genius bright would wing its flight,\r\n    The mind is theirs to dare it;\r\n  But high or low, in joy or woe,\r\n    With any fate before them,\r\n  The sweetest bliss they know, is this--\r\n    To aid the land that bore them.\r\n\r\n  CHORUS:--Over here in England, &c.\r\n\r\n  By many a sign from Thames to Tyne,\r\n    From Holyhead to Dover,\r\n  The eye may trace the deathless race\r\n    Our gallant land sent over.\r\n  Midst beech and oak, midst flame and smoke.\r\n    Up springs the cross-tipped steeple\r\n  That, far and wide, tells where abide\r\n    The faithful Irish people.\r\n\r\n  CHORUS:--Over here in England, &c.\r\n\r\n  And this I say--on any day\r\n   That help of theirs is needed,\r\n  Dear Ireland's call will never fall\r\n   On their true hearts unheeded\r\n  They'll plainly show to friend and foe.\r\n   If e'er the need arises\r\n  Her arm is long, and stout and strong,\r\n   To work some strange surprises!\r\n\r\n  CHORUS:--Over here in England, &c.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that T.D. never allowed himself to be bound by\r\nconventionalities. There was always a refreshing thoroughness and\r\nheartiness in what he did. For instance, when he was Lord Mayor of\r\nDublin, he on one occasion \"opened\" a public bath by stripping and\r\nswimming round it--the Town Clerk and other officials following his\r\nexample.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned the good work done in Liverpool by Father Nugent, and\r\nthat I had the pleasure of co-operating with him in some of his\r\nundertakings.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the Home Rule movement connected with the name of Isaac\r\nButt, and for some years previously, I had been brought into still\r\ncloser contact with him, first, as secretary of his refuge for destitute\r\nand homeless boys, and then as manager and acting editor of the\r\n\"Northern Press and Catholic Times,\" after that paper had come into his\r\nhands. I also assisted him in the temperance movement which he started\r\nin Liverpool.\r\n\r\nWhen Father Nugent asked me to take charge of the \"Catholic Times,\" I\r\nentered upon the work literally single-handed, like some of the editors\r\nwe read of a generation or so ago in the Western States of America;\r\nfor, when he left me for a nine months' tour in the States, I\r\nconstituted in my own person the whole staff. We afterwards had some\r\nable men on the paper. Among these was John McArdle, who left us, as I\r\nhave said, to join the \"Nation.\" He became later a well-known dramatic\r\nauthor, his chief works being burlesques and pantomimes. We also had\r\nJames Lysaght Finigan, of whom I speak elsewhere.\r\n\r\nWhile Father Nugent was in America, we used to get great help from a\r\nfine old Jesuit priest and good Irish Nationalist, Father James\r\nMcSwiney, then of St. Francis Xavier's, Liverpool. He was never happier\r\nthan when smoking his short pipe by the fire in our inner office. With\r\nhis help we created a much admired feature in the \"Catholic Times\" in\r\nour \"Answers to Correspondents.\" With the view of drawing on real\r\nenquiries, he used to concoct and then answer questions on points of\r\ndoctrine, etc. Some people were astonished at the profound\r\nknowledge--and others at what they considered \"the impudence\"--displayed\r\nby Jack McArdle and John Denvir in answering any theological posers that\r\nmight be put to us, never dreaming we had behind us one of the ablest\r\ntheologians of the Jesuit order.\r\n\r\nWhen Father Nugent took the paper in hands, the readers had such\r\nconfidence in it that, from being merely a local paper, we were able\r\nbefore long to make it a leading Catholic organ for the whole country.\r\n\r\nThe reverend father was chaplain of the Liverpool Borough jail. He was\r\nrespected by all classes, Protestant as well as Catholic, not only for\r\nwhat he did for the unfortunate creatures who came under his\r\nministrations, but as a public-spirited citizen and benefactor of the\r\ntown. It would be wrong if I did not pay a high tribute to the splendid\r\nservice done by him in Liverpool towards elevating the condition of our\r\nown people. I would be ungrateful, too, if I failed to recognise the\r\ngreat educational work he did in giving opportunities for culture to\r\nmany Liverpool Irishmen, myself among the number, which afterwards aided\r\ntheir advancement in the battle of life. That is why I never regretted\r\nthat I gave Father Nugent, when conducting the \"Catholic Times\" for him,\r\nthree of the best years of my life. I never regretted my experiences in\r\nconnection with that paper, particularly in the reporting department,\r\nfor they were often very pleasant ones. Among these was my having been\r\nintroduced to the great Archbishop MacHale, when I went to St.\r\nNicholas's to report his sermon.\r\n\r\nI have many vivid remembrances arising out of my connection with the\r\n\"Catholic Times.\"\r\n\r\nIt was during the time I was in charge of it that we started the Irish\r\nnational organisation on this side of the Channel--the Home Rule\r\nConfederation of Great Britain, formed at our first annual convention\r\nheld in Manchester, at which I was elected as the first General\r\nSecretary of the organisation.\r\n\r\nI was at the same time secretary of the Liverpool Catholic Club, and in\r\nthat capacity I assisted in entertaining the Canadian Papal Zouaves when\r\npassing through Liverpool on their way home, after their gallant but\r\nunsuccessful struggle to uphold the power of the Pope against the\r\nrevolutionaries.\r\n\r\nIn the same way it became my duty as secretary of the club to organise\r\nthe Catholic vote in Liverpool on the occasion of the first School Board\r\nElection. The Irish and those of Irish extraction in Liverpool being\r\nreckoned as about one-third of the population, the Catholic body is\r\ncorrespondingly numerous. We surprised both friend and foe in the\r\nresults. There were fifteen members to be elected, and we asked our\r\npeople to give three votes for each of our five candidates. They were\r\nnot only elected, but the votes actually given for them--on the\r\ncumulative principle--could have elected eight out of the fifteen\r\nmembers of the Board.\r\n\r\nFather Nugent, though immensely popular with all classes, was not, I\r\nthink, a _persona grata_, any more than myself, with Canon Fisher, the\r\nVicar-General of the diocese, who was very anti-Irish, and, so far as he\r\ncould, prevented anyone connected with the \"Catholic Times\" coming into\r\npersonal contact with Bishop Goss, who was a typical Englishman of the\r\nbest kind. The bishop had a blunt, hitting-out-from-the-shoulder style\r\nof speaking in his sermons that compelled attention. But you could\r\nhardly call them sermons at all; they were rather powerful discourses\r\nupon social topics, which, from a newspaper point of view, made splendid\r\n\"copy.\" Accordingly, during the year before his death, I followed him\r\nall over the diocese to get his sermon for each week's paper. There is\r\nno doubt that Dr. Goss's sermons helped materially to put a backbone\r\ninto the \"Catholic Times\" and greatly to increase its circulation.\r\n\r\nIn one of the rural districts the bishop was giving an illustration of\r\nthe meaning of \"Tradition,\" and, very much to my embarrassment, I found\r\nhim taking me for his text. He said--\"So far as I know, there were no\r\nnewspapers in Our Lord's days; there was nobody taking down _His_\r\nsermons, as there is to-day taking mine; so that _His_ teaching had to\r\nbe by word of mouth, and much of it has come down to us as Tradition.\"\r\n\r\nIn the interest of the paper, Father Nugent was anxious that I should be\r\nintroduced to the Bishop. But he knew, as well as I did, that the\r\ndifficulty in the way of this was what might be called the Grand Vizier,\r\nCanon Fisher. \"You should push forward, Denvir,\" Father Nugent would\r\nsay, \"after Mass is over, and ask to see the Bishop.\" Over and over\r\nagain I did so, but was always met at the vestry door by Canon Fisher,\r\nwith his suave smile. \"Well, Mr. Denvir, what can I do for you?\" \"I\r\nwould like to see his lordship,\" I would say. No use. The Canon would\r\nsay--\"No, no; don't trouble the Bishop; I can give you all the\r\ninformation you want;\" and so it went on, and I was baffled in my\r\nattempts.\r\n\r\nI ought to say that, though Canon Fisher was able to keep me from coming\r\ninto personal contact with Bishop Goss, Father Nugent was too strong for\r\nhim in the end; for, eventually, we got into communication with the\r\nBishop regularly every week on the subject of his sermons. Each Monday\r\nas soon as my copy was set up, we sent him a proof, which he would read\r\nand correct and return. But his \"corrections\" often included the\r\naddition of altogether new matter, which made the sermon the more\r\ninteresting and valuable to us. Indeed, on several occasions, we used\r\nhis new matter, with slight alterations, as leaders. The very week he\r\ndied we had one of these leaders in type, and it appeared in the same\r\nissue which announced his death.\r\n\r\nWhen Cardinal Vaughan became Bishop of Salford, Father Nugent succeeded\r\nin getting his support and influence for the \"Catholic Times,\" a most\r\nvaluable thing for us, seeing that Manchester, though with a smaller\r\nCatholic population than Liverpool, was of more importance from a\r\npublishing point of view, as from that city can be more readily reached\r\na number of large manufacturing towns, of which it is the centre. Again\r\nit was--\"Denvir, you must see the Bishop.\" But this time there was no\r\ndifficulty, as an appointment had been made for me. Accordingly, by\r\narrangement, I reached Manchester one morning between six and seven\r\no'clock, that being the most convenient time for him that Bishop Vaughan\r\ncould give me, and together we discussed the best means of forwarding\r\nthe interests of the paper in the diocese of Salford. I found him,\r\nbesides being a man of courtly presence, as we all know, most\r\nbroad-minded and genial, and keenly alive to the influence which a good\r\nnewspaper would have upon his people.\r\n\r\nWhenever I see the \"Catholic Times,\" I feel gratified at its very\r\nexistence, as a proof that my three years with Father Nugent were not\r\naltogether spent in vain. For when he placed its control in my hands on\r\nhis departure for America, I found it with a very small circulation, and\r\nanything but a paying concern; whereas, when I yielded up the trust into\r\nhis hands, I had the satisfaction of handing over to him a substantial\r\namount of cash in hand, a statement of assets and liabilities showing a\r\nsatisfactory balance on the right side, and a paper with a largely\r\nincreased and paying circulation.\r\n\r\nFor many years previous to his death, I did not come into contact with\r\nhim. Indeed it was only the year before he died that I had the\r\npleasure--and it was all the more a pleasure as we had differed strongly\r\nduring previous years on some points--of meeting him at his house in\r\nFormby. This was before his last visit to America, where he contracted\r\nthe illness which terminated in his death soon after his return to\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR--AN IRISH AMBULANCE CORPS--THE FRENCH FOREIGN\r\nLEGION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Franco-Prussian War broke out, the sympathy of Ireland was\r\nnaturally, for historic reasons, on the side of France. It was not\r\nsurprising, then, that many young Irishmen who had served in America, or\r\nin the ranks of the Papal Volunteers, or had borne a share in the Fenian\r\nmovement, were anxious to show their sympathy in a practical way, and at\r\nthe same time to gratify the national propensity for a fight\r\n\r\n                --in any good cause at all.\r\n\r\nI happened to number among my friends some of these young Irishmen, of\r\nwhom I may mention Captain Martin Kirwan, James Lysaght Finigan, Edmond\r\nO'Donovan, Arthur Forrester, Frank Byrne, and James O'Kelly. There was a\r\nstrong feeling in Ireland to send a considerable body of men to France,\r\nbut the law stood in the way. It was evaded by the formation of an\r\nAmbulance Corps, and for this generous subscriptions flowed in, along\r\nwith numerous applications from volunteers. These were all medically\r\nexamined, as if for a regular army, and in this way as fine a body of\r\nyoung men as ever left Ireland was picked from those who had\r\nvolunteered. The ambulance service was equipped in the most perfect\r\nmanner, and presented to the French nation. On arriving in France, there\r\nwere (as was, of course, intended) more men than were required for the\r\nambulance duties, and these at once volunteered for service as soldiers.\r\nThey were formed into a company under the command of Captain Kirwan, one\r\nof the sergeants being Frank Byrne, who was afterwards Kirwan's\r\ncolleague as an official of the Irish constitutional organisation in\r\nGreat Britain. The company might have developed into a regiment, and\r\neven into a brigade, had the movement started earlier to get men over to\r\nFrance by various means. This could have been done, notwithstanding the\r\nForeign Enlistment Act; and towards the end of the war, French agents\r\nwere in this country providing for the sending over of large numbers of\r\nmen to France, when the capitulation of Paris caused the collapse of\r\ntheir arrangements.\r\n\r\nThe men of the Irish Ambulance Corps did their work so well as to show\r\nthat not only did Irishmen make good soldiers, but that, possessing the\r\nsympathetic Celtic nature, their services were highly appreciated by the\r\nwounded who fell to their charge. Captain Kirwan's company fought\r\nbravely, sustaining the credit of their country through the whole\r\ncampaign, and, under Bourbaki, were among those who actually struck the\r\nlast blow the Germans received on French soil.\r\n\r\nArthur Forrester, who joined the French Foreign Legion, was severely\r\nwounded in the foot. After the war he came into the office of the\r\n\"Catholic Times,\" when I was manager and John McArdle editor of that\r\npaper. We welcomed him, of course, not only as an old friend and brother\r\njournalist, but as one who had been fighting for France.\r\n\r\nIn his \"Camp Fires of the Legion\" written for my \"Irish Library,\" James\r\nLysaght Finigan tells of his adventures in the war. He found his way to\r\nLille, in the north of France, and, with several hundreds of other\r\nIrishmen became enrolled in the ranks of the Foreign Legion. In\r\nLieutenant Elliott he was delighted to recognise Edmond O'Donovan, who\r\nhad figured so prominently in the Fenian movement, and whose\r\nincarceration in Ireland and exile in America were fresh in his memory.\r\n\"The Legion,\" Finigan says, \"showed itself worthy of its predecessors,\r\nthe Irish Brigades of former days, during the reverses that constantly\r\nbefel the armies of France.\" He gives graphic accounts of the battles\r\nthey were engaged in, and how, in the defence of Orleans, he and a\r\nnumber of his comrades were taken prisoners, among those being his\r\nfriend O'Donovan, who had been wounded by a piece of shell.\r\n\r\nThe Foreign Legion must have borne the brunt of the fighting. The fourth\r\nbattalion was cut to pieces at Woerth, Gravelotte, and Sedan; the fifth\r\nbattalion was reduced from 3,000 to some 300; the sixth battalion retook\r\nOrleans, was compelled to abandon it, and covered itself with glory at\r\nLe Mans and elsewhere; and the seventh was interned with Bourbaki in\r\nSwitzerland until the end of the war.\r\n\r\nAlthough I often heard from him afterwards, the last time I met Edmond\r\nO'Donovan, if I remember rightly, was in a North Lancashire town, in\r\nwhich John O'Connor Power had been lecturing the same night. I forget\r\nexactly who else of the \"boys\" were there--I think William Hogan was\r\none--but there were some choice spirits, and we made just such an Irish\r\nnight of it as Finigan describes they had when he and O'Donovan fought\r\nin the Foreign Legion.\r\n\r\nEdmond O'Donovan was the son of the famous Irish scholar and antiquary,\r\nJohn O'Donovan, the translator from the Gaelic--with O'Curry and\r\nPetrie--of that great Irish history, \"The Annals of the Four Masters,\"\r\nand other manuscripts. The elder O'Donovan had made the acquaintance of\r\nSir Thomas Larcom, when both were young men together on the staff of the\r\nOrdnance Survey. John O'Donovan appointed his friend Larcom to be\r\nguardian of his children in case of his death.\r\n\r\nIt was Larcom's duty, as an official of the Government, to hunt down the\r\nFenians, both native and foreign, so that he had undertaken a serious\r\nand perplexing charge. For O'Donovan's elder sons were strong\r\nNationalists and Fenians; so that, on the death of his old friend,\r\nLarcom was like an old hen having charge of a brood of ducklings who\r\ncould not be kept from the troubled waters of Fenianism. There is no\r\ndoubt that Larcom's influence kept them from or saved them from a lot\r\nof trouble. The O'Donovans were an accomplished family, the one I knew\r\nbest, besides Edmond, being Richard, who has held a responsible\r\nmercantile position for some years, and who furnished me with much\r\nvaluable information about his father, when Thomas Flannery--one of our\r\nbest Gaelic scholars--was writing a life of Dr. John O'Donovan for my\r\n\"Irish Library\" series.\r\n\r\nBesides being thoroughly acquainted with several languages, Edmond\r\nO'Donovan had an excellent scientific training, which was brought into\r\nrequisition in connection with the projected Fenian military movements\r\nin Ireland. While a thorough classical scholar, the poems he liked best\r\nwere the songs of Thomas Davis and the Young Irelanders. He was slender\r\nof figure and had a handsome oval face. In speaking, whether in private\r\nor before an audience, he had an animated and expressive manner, with a\r\ngood deal of gesture, such as a Frenchman or Italian would use. I have\r\nheard him singing songs like \"Clare's Dragoons\" with much fire and\r\nfervour, throwing his whole soul into it in a way I can never forget.\r\n\r\nIn 1877-1878 he was a special correspondent in the Russo-Turkish war\r\nwith the Turkish army, and he sent home powerful and graphic accounts of\r\nevery battle and siege.\r\n\r\nHis intimate knowledge of Arabic stood to him in these and in the\r\nEgyptian campaigns in which he afterwards took part. In 1879 he went\r\nthrough Russia to the shores of the Caspian Sea, travelled through the\r\nnorth of Persia and the adjacent territory of Khorassan, to the land of\r\nthe Tekke Turcomans, and to Merv, thus penetrating the mysteries of\r\nCentral Asia as no European traveller had ever done so perfectly before.\r\nIn 1881 he returned to England, and published his book, \"The Merv\r\nOasis,\" and afterwards read a paper before the Royal Geographical\r\nSociety on \"Merv and its surroundings.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, in 1883, he went as special correspondent to the Soudan, and\r\nthere this brilliant Irishman perished with the whole of Hicks Pasha's\r\narmy. No tidings ever came of how Edmond O'Donovan met his death, but\r\nthose who knew him best feel that he must have yielded up his gallant\r\nspirit to its Creator with a courage and fortitude worthy of an\r\nIrishman.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1906, I had occasion to call upon his brother Richard in\r\nLiverpool, and asked if they had ever got any trace of Edmond. Nothing\r\nhad been heard of how he had actually perished, but an authentic relic\r\nof him had fallen into the hands of a priest in the Soudan. This was a\r\nblood-stained garment, which was proved beyond doubt to have belonged to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned another name in connection with the Franco-Prussian\r\nWar--that of James O'Kelly. His career, like that of O'Donovan, had been\r\nstormy and adventurous. I had previously met him in connection with the\r\nFenian movement.\r\n\r\nHe had been in the French army, and served in the campaign which was so\r\ndisastrous to the Mexican Emperor Maximilian. His adventurous\r\ntemperament led him again to join the French service during the\r\nFranco-Prussian war. He was employed on the confidential mission of\r\nraising a force of Irishmen for the war. I have described the formation\r\nof the company under Kirwan, which was the outcome of the Ambulance\r\nCorps. It will be seen, too, that there were a considerable number of\r\nIrishmen in the Foreign Legion. But, after all, these did not amount to\r\na number sufficient to have much appreciable result on the ultimate\r\nfortunes of the war. The French military authorities, knowing what\r\nsplendid fighting materials Irishmen would make, commissioned O'Kelly to\r\nraise a large force. For this purpose he made Liverpool his\r\nheadquarters, and I was pleased to see him again when he called upon me\r\nat the office of the \"Catholic Times\" My sympathies were strongly with\r\nFrance, and I gave him what assistance I could in furthering the object\r\nof his mission. At my suggestion, therefore, he took up his abode at the\r\nhotel opposite our office, at the corner of Moorfields and Dale Street.\r\nA large number of volunteers were got from among the advanced element in\r\nLiverpool and surrounding towns, who wanted to learn the use of arms in\r\nreal warfare--their ultimate object I need not mention. From other\r\nquarters in Ireland as well as England there were volunteers for the\r\nFrench army. I had arranged through an emigration agent, Mr. Michael\r\nFrancis Duffy, a much respected and patriotic Irishman of singular\r\nculture, for the charter of two steamers to take the men to Havre; but\r\njust then Paris fell, after a long siege; the war ended, and the Irish\r\nLegion project collapsed.\r\n\r\nIn 1872 James O'Kelly turned his attention to journalism as a\r\nprofession. He got his first opening on the \"New York Herald,\" partly\r\nthrough his thorough knowledge of the military profession, but still\r\nmore by that singular tact that never failed him under the most trying\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nSome years after, he called on me again in Liverpool, and I heard from\r\nhim of some stirring incidents in his career. Amongst those were his\r\nperilous experiences in connection with the fighting in Cuba, from which\r\nhe narrowly escaped with his life.\r\n\r\nSince then he has entered Parliament. He was a staunch supporter from\r\nthe first of Mr. Parnell. When the unfortunate \"split\" came, he took the\r\nside of the \"Chief,\" but none is more pleased than he to be a member of\r\nthe now re-united Irish Party.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the Franco-Prussian war I may be allowed to refer\r\nhere to a non-combatant, who, with his brother priests, remained at\r\ntheir post during the terrible siege of Paris, ministering to the sick\r\nand dying. This was my cousin, Father Bernard O'Loughlin, Superior of\r\nthe Passionist Order in Paris.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, notwithstanding their noble services to humanity on this and\r\nother occasions, the Passionist Fathers have since been driven out of\r\nthe country by the French Government. The announcement of the danger of\r\nthis, when it was first threatened, caused consternation in the foreign\r\nCatholic colony of Paris, to whom the Passionist Fathers had endeared\r\nthemselves by their labours on behalf of needy and stranded\r\nEnglish-speaking people, and their devoted spiritual ministrations.\r\n\r\nThe Passionist mission in Paris was founded some forty years ago by\r\nFather Bernard, with his friend, Father Ignatius Spencer, also a\r\nPassionist, and uncle of the present Earl Spencer.\r\n\r\nThe Archbishop of Paris had invited the Passionists to establish a\r\nchurch in Paris, on account of the number of Irish, American, and\r\nEnglish Catholics requiring religious ministrations, few of the French\r\nclergy being able to speak English. Father O'Loughlin first commenced\r\nhis labours in the Church of St. Nicholas, in the Rue Saint Honoré,\r\nwhere he remained three years. After this a sum of 200,000 francs was\r\nsubscribed, chiefly by Irish, American, and English residents, for the\r\nsite and building of a church. Father Bernard was soon joined by several\r\nother members of the order sent from England, and there were always four\r\nor five Passionist Fathers attached as chaplains to the church. The\r\nfollowing distinguished prelates have preached in this Church--Cardinal\r\nManning, Cardinal Newman, Cardinal Richard, Archbishop Ireland,\r\nArchbishop Spalding, and Archbishop Passadière.\r\n\r\nMrs. Mackay was the most generous of the supporters of the order in\r\nParis; and, in 1903, when the fathers found themselves unable to pay the\r\ntax created by the French \"Loi d'accroissement,\" she paid down the\r\n20,000 francs required to save the church.\r\n\r\nTheir devotion in remaining faithful to their flock during the long and\r\nterrible siege of Paris in 1870 ought to have recommended them to the\r\nsympathies of all patriotic Frenchmen. The Passionists not only\r\nministered to the spiritual but to the temporal wants of those coming\r\nunder their charge. They visited the sick and poor, relieved the age in\r\nneed, provided for orphans, and assisted stranded Irish and English\r\ngovernesses, irrespective of creed, who had come to Paris in search of\r\nsituations. Those who suffered most from the withdrawal of the\r\nPassionists were the poor and afflicted.\r\n\r\nThe Cardinal Archbishop of Paris, the American Embassy, and the British\r\nAmbassador, addressed the French Government on their behalf, pointing\r\nout that the services of the Passionists were indispensable--but in\r\nvain. It is humiliating that the government of what is supposed to be a\r\ngreat Catholic nation like France should be appealed to in such a cause,\r\nfruitlessly, by the ambassador of non-Catholic England.\r\n\r\nFather Bernard O'Loughlin's name in the world was John, after his\r\nfather, my mother's brother, John O'Loughlin. The elder John was a\r\nbrewer's traveller, and often came to our house in Liverpool, bringing\r\nhis violin with him. He had a wide knowledge of old Irish airs, and to\r\nhis accompaniment we had many a genuine Irish night, singing the\r\nstirring songs then appearing in the \"Nation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTHE HOME RULE CONFEDERATION OF GREAT BRITAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the previous chapter it will be seen that I have somewhat anticipated\r\nthe course of events described in this narrative in order to give brief\r\nsketches of some of my friends who took part, in various capacities, in\r\nthe Franco-Prussian war, and incidents arising out of it. I have also,\r\nfor the sake of compactness, briefly touched on their subsequent\r\ncareers.\r\n\r\nI shall here now resume my recollections of the Home Rule movement from\r\nits inception in 1870.\r\n\r\nFrom the first everything pointed to Isaac Butt as its leader. His\r\nsplendid abilities, even when ranged against us in the celebrated debate\r\nin the Dublin Corporation with O'Connell, excited the admiration of his\r\nfellow-countrymen; but now, when he had come over to the popular side,\r\nhe was welcomed with acclamation, the more so that his genial and\r\nloveable nature was bound to win the hearts of a susceptible people like\r\nours. Moreover, his joining the popular side was due to the impression\r\nmade upon him by the Fenian leaders, so many of whom he defended in the\r\ntrials from '67 onward; and he has left on record a remarkable testimony\r\nto the purity of their principles and the nobility of their ideals.\r\n\r\nHe was lacking in certain qualities, the want of which in his character\r\nprevented him being such a strong leader as O'Connell or Parnell. But,\r\nall the same, while he led he gave splendid services--which can never be\r\nforgotten--to the cause.\r\n\r\nAs I have said, Alfred Crilly and I were generally expected to take the\r\ninitiative in any new Irish movement in Liverpool. Accordingly, towards\r\nthe end of 1871, we were asked to make a move in connection with the new\r\norganisation in Ireland. We formed a small committee, and invited Isaac\r\nButt to our projected opening demonstration. He was not able to come to\r\nour first gathering, but we had many opportunities during the years that\r\nfollowed of making his acquaintance; and, personally, I received many\r\nkindnesses at his hands. With Alfred Crilly I was sent to Dublin by the\r\nCommittee to find influential speakers for our public inaugural\r\nLiverpool demonstration, to be held on the 3rd of January, 1872, our\r\nassociation having been opened some months previously. We secured the\r\nservices of Mr. A.M. Sullivan and Professor Galbraith of Trinity\r\nCollege.\r\n\r\nWhen we returned to Liverpool it became our duty to find a chairman for\r\nour meeting worthy of the occasion. Mr. Charles Russell, who was first\r\nasked, suggested that we should get some one of more influence than\r\nhimself. \"Why not ask Dr. Commins?\" he said.\r\n\r\nDr. Commins was a barrister on the same circuit as Charles Russell. We\r\ndid ask him. He cheerfully consented, and from that hour he was for a\r\nlong time the leading figure in the struggle for Home Rule in Great\r\nBritain, being for several years President of the organisation. There is\r\nno more homely and unassuming man, ever accessible to the humblest of\r\nhis fellow-countrymen, than \"the Doctor,\" as his friends affectionately\r\ncall him.\r\n\r\nHe had a brilliant university career, and was a man of such wide\r\nattainments that I think there was a general belief amongst Liverpool\r\nIrishmen that he knew _everything_. Accordingly, they used frequently to\r\ngo to him to settle some knotty point beyond the ordinary conception,\r\nand they seldom came away unsatisfied.\r\n\r\nDr. Commins is an accomplished poet, and was for many years a\r\ncontributor to the columns of the \"Nation\" and the \"United Irishman\" (of\r\nLiverpool). In 1876 he was elected as a Home Ruler to represent Vauxhall\r\nWard in the Liverpool Town Council. He has ever since been a member of\r\nthat body, being now an Alderman of the city. In due time he became a\r\nmember of the Irish Parliamentary Party, of which several other\r\nLiverpool Irishmen have been members.\r\n\r\nLiverpool was not alone in forming its Home Rule Association; most of\r\nthe large towns had them in due course, but for some time there was no\r\nbond of union between them. This, however, was formed in due time, the\r\nman to take the first step in bringing us together being John Barry,\r\nthen residing in Manchester, and the chief man in our organisation\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nJohn was, therefore, practically the founder of the great organisation\r\nwhich, under its various names--of the Home Rule Confederation of Great\r\nBritain. Irish National Land League of Great Britain, Irish National\r\nLeague of Great Britain, and United Irish League of Great Britain--has\r\nbeen in existence since 1873, working in accordance with and taking the\r\nname of whatever has been the recognised organisation for the time being\r\nin Ireland.\r\n\r\nJohn Barry, who had borne an active share in the struggle for\r\nself-government--irrespective of the methods being constitutional or\r\nunconstitutional--was a man of attractive personality and an\r\nindefatigable worker and organiser. He was the Secretary of the\r\nManchester Home Rule Association, and, seeing the want of some body in\r\nwhich the various associations in Great Britain would be represented,\r\nhe, in the name and with the authority of his branch, issued invitations\r\nto the associations then known to exist to send delegates to a\r\nConvention to be held in Manchester. To give importance to the occasion,\r\nand the necessary authority, Isaac Butt was invited to preside, and to\r\nattend a great demonstration in the Free Trade Hall, on the night of the\r\nConvention, January 18th, 1873.\r\n\r\nAlthough I bore an active part in the organising of that first Home Rule\r\nConvention of Great Britain, it is only a short time since, after a\r\nlapse of over thirty years, that I heard from John Barry himself the\r\ndifficulty he had in securing the presence of the Home Rule leader. It\r\nwas a long time since we had seen each other, but I found him the same\r\ncheery, warm-hearted, generous, and patriotic John Barry as ever. It\r\nwas in the office of his firm in London we met, and took advantage of\r\nthe opportunity to fight our battles over again; and he reminded me of\r\nthe sort of inner circle of the I.R.B. to which he and I, and others who\r\nhave since been prominent in Irish politics, belonged.\r\n\r\nHe was always, however, a practical patriot, and would use every\r\nlegitimate method to serve Ireland. That was why he threw himself with\r\nsuch ardour into the Home Rule movement.\r\n\r\nHe told me of how he went over to Dublin to secure the promise of Isaac\r\nButt to preside at the projected Convention, and to attend the\r\ndemonstration in the evening. He got the requisite promise, and the\r\nannouncement was made in all good faith in Manchester. So far all looked\r\npromising; but what was his alarm to hear, within three days of the\r\nevent, that Isaac Butt's professional engagements would prevent his\r\nbeing able to attend. Added to this he had heard that Butt, who was of a\r\nsomewhat irresolute temperament, was being warned that he was falling\r\ninto the hands of a \"Fenian gang.\"\r\n\r\nBarry spent all the money he had in sending to the Irish leader a\r\ntelegram as earnest, hot, and forcible as he was capable of, beseeching\r\nhim to come, and pointing out to him the serious consequences to the\r\nCause in Great Britain of his failure to do so. This telegraphic budget\r\nreached Butt in Court; and, as he turned over leaf after leaf of the\r\nmessage, he said to a friend sitting alongside of him--\"This man's in\r\nearnest, at any rate,\" and immediately wired back--\"Will go, if alive.\"\r\n\r\nApart from the offensiveness of styling us a \"gang,\" those who had\r\nwarned Butt of the hands into which he was falling may not, probably,\r\nhave been far astray as regards some of those from whom he had received\r\nthe invitation; seeing that when the organisation for Great Britain was\r\nduly formed, John Barry, John Ryan, John Walsh, and myself were elected\r\non the Executive; but, at all events, Isaac Butt turned up.\r\n\r\nSome twenty Home Rule Associations responded to the invitation by\r\nsending delegates to the Convention. There is a remarkable contrast\r\nbetween this, the first of these Conventions, and those held every year\r\nsince; for, at some of those, several hundreds of branches have been\r\nrepresented--showing the growth of the organisation since 1873.\r\n\r\nAt this Manchester Convention, at which Mr. Butt presided, it was\r\nresolved to form a central body from the existing local associations, to\r\nbe called the Home Rule Confederation of Great Britain. Isaac Butt\r\nhimself was elected the first President. I was elected the first General\r\nSecretary, and it became my duty to find out the existing associations\r\nwhich had not sent delegates to Manchester, and to invite them, as well\r\nas those who had been represented at the present gathering, to a\r\nsupplementary convention. It was decided to hold this in Birmingham, to\r\ncomplete the arrangements made in Manchester for the future working of\r\nthe organisation.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the Manchester Convention Mr. Butt was the chief speaker\r\nat the public demonstration. Mr. John Ferguson, of Glasgow, was our\r\nChairman. He was a sterling Ulster Protestant Nationalist. Many used to\r\nthink he was a Scot. Indeed, I thought at one time myself he must be of\r\nScottish extraction at all events, there being, I thought, more Scottish\r\nFergusons than Irish. Speaking to him on the subject, I was reminded by\r\nhim of the Irish king, Fergus, the founder of the Scottish monarchy; and\r\nhe claimed to be of genuine Irish descent.\r\n\r\nHe often used to call on me when I was conducting the \"Catholic Times.\"\r\nAt that time he was travelling for his firm of Cameron & Ferguson, who\r\npublished a good many popular works on Irish subjects. We were both\r\npleased to hear of the initiative John Barry had taken towards the\r\nformation of the Irish organisation of Great Britain. If I remember\r\nrightly, John Ferguson was in Liverpool at the time, and we went to\r\nManchester together to attend this our first Annual Convention.\r\n\r\nAfter the Manchester Convention, I found there were considerably more\r\nHome Rule Associations in existence than had been represented at our\r\nfirst gathering. As a consequence we had a much larger and more\r\nrepresentative attendance at our adjourned Convention in Birmingham. Mr.\r\nButt presided in the morning and Mr. A.M. Sullivan in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman at the public demonstration at night was Father Sherlock,\r\none of the finest specimens of the good old \"soggarth aroon\" type it has\r\never been my privilege to meet. Several years afterwards, when I was\r\norganiser for the League in the Birmingham district, I was right glad\r\nto have the opportunity of renewing my acquaintance with him. The very\r\ncontact with Father John Sherlock was elevating and inspiring, so\r\ntransparent were the simplicity and purity of his life. Here was a\r\nsaint, I thought, if ever there was one on earth.\r\n\r\nIn my experience I have generally found that the men who have taken the\r\nlead in most places have been professional men rather than traders. This\r\nwas true of Birmingham as well as elsewhere. There were no men who did\r\nbetter service than Hugh Heinrick, an able journalist (who afterwards\r\nbecame editor of the \"United Irishman,\" the organ of our Confederation),\r\nand Professor Bertram Windle. I was glad to see in the newspapers the\r\nannouncement of such a genuine Irishman as Dr. Windle being appointed\r\nPresident of the University College, Cork.\r\n\r\nProfessor Windle is an honour to his new position, and is as devoted to\r\nthe cause of creed and country as he was when one of the Professors of\r\nthe Queen's University, Birmingham.\r\n\r\nDuring the years when I was organiser for the League in Birmingham; I\r\nbecame intimately acquainted with him. I found him not only a man of\r\ngreat learning, but an earnest Catholic and devoted Irish Nationalist.\r\nNo man in our organisation did better service, and he was always ready\r\nto go at a moment's notice to speak or lecture wherever required.\r\n\r\nAs a further illustration of what I have said about the aid given to the\r\ncause by professional men, I ought to mention Dr. James Mullin, of\r\nCardiff. He was a leading and active man in his district when I\r\ntravelled in South Wales as an organiser. His talent as a poet has made\r\nhim well known in Wales, and his accounts of travels in many lands have\r\nfound many admiring readers. His heart is as warm as his brain is\r\nactive, which is saying much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nBIGGAR AND PARNELL--THE \"UNITED IRISHMAN \"--THE O'CONNELL CENTENARY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe General Election of 1874 was remarkable as the first since the Union\r\nwhich had clearly and distinctly returned a majority of Irish members of\r\nParliament as Home Rulers. Previously most of them had been returned as\r\nLiberals or Tories. It is memorable in my eyes, as it was the occasion\r\nwhen two of my personal friends, Alexander Martin Sullivan and Joseph\r\nGillis Biggar, first entered Parliament. It was in the year after he was\r\nelected that Mr. Biggar made his _debut_ as an \"obstructionist.\"\r\n\r\nCharles Stewart Parnell having been, in the spring of 1875, elected as\r\nsuccessor in the representation of Meath to \"honest John Martin,\" it was\r\nnot long before the famous \"Biggar and Parnell\" combination, which was\r\ndestined to revolutionize the whole system of Parliamentary procedure,\r\nwas created.\r\n\r\nFeeling the necessity for a newspaper representing the views of the Home\r\nRule Confederation and chronicling its work from week to week, the\r\nExecutive promoted the formation of a limited liability company for the\r\npurpose, and the outcome was the issue of the \"United Irishman,\" the\r\nfirst number of which appeared on June 4th, 1875. I was appointed\r\nmanager, and was also the publisher, the paper being produced at my\r\nplace of business, 68 Byrom Street, Liverpool. The following were the\r\nDirectors--Andrew Commins, LL.D., Chairman; and John Barry, Joseph\r\nGillis Biggar, M.P., John Ferguson, Richard Mangan, Bernard MacAnulty,\r\nand Peter McKinley. William John Oliver was Honorary Secretary, with\r\nHugh Heinrick as Editor at the commencement, and Daniel Crilly\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\nThe newspaper was fortunate in its Honorary Secretary, for William John\r\nOliver was one of the most enthusiastic workers we ever had in the Home\r\nRule movement. He was at this time engaged in commerce in Liverpool,\r\nhaving previously been an officer in the Royal Navy. He was ever willing\r\nto be \"the man in the gap\" in case of an emergency, and that was how he\r\nbecame for a time the Honorary General Secretary of the Home Rule\r\nConfederation. He was always a cheery and, at the same time, an\r\neminently practical man. He took a leading part in our local elections\r\nin Liverpool from the time we began to fight them on Home Rule\r\nprinciples--when the necessity arose, as I have elsewhere explained, to\r\nhave public men who were not afraid to identify themselves with the\r\nnational cause.\r\n\r\nHugh Heinrick, our editor, was a brilliant writer, who had, for several\r\nyears, been a strenuous worker in the Home Rule cause. He was a frequent\r\ncontributor of poetry to the \"Nation\" and other national journals,\r\ngenerally over the signature of \"Hugh Mac Erin.\" He was born in the\r\nCounty Wexford in 1831. Before taking up the editorship of the \"United\r\nIrishman\" he was for many years resident in Birmingham, where he was a\r\nschoolmaster. He died in 1887.\r\n\r\nDaniel Crilly, one of the most active and eloquent advocates of the\r\nIrish cause in Liverpool, succeeded him--this being his maiden effort in\r\njournalism. He was afterwards on the staff of the \"Nation,\" and also did\r\ngood service while a member of the Irish Parliamentary Party.\r\n\r\nAmong other contributors to the \"United Irishman\" were Isaac Butt, Dr.\r\nCommins, Frank Hugh O'Donnell, Michael Clarke, Captain Kirwan, and Frank\r\nByrne. Our poetry was a strong point with us--Dr. Commins, Frank Fox,\r\nJohn Hand, Patrick Clarke, Heber MacMahon, and Miss Bessie Murphy being\r\namong the contributors.\r\n\r\nWhen the \"United Irishman\" was started, the offices of the Home Rule\r\nConfederation, which had previously been in Manchester, were for\r\nconvenience removed to my place of business. As the executive meetings\r\nand the meetings of the newspaper directors were held there, I\r\nfrequently had the pleasure of meeting under my own roof Irishmen who\r\neither then were or afterwards became prominent members of the Irish\r\nParliamentary Party, including Isaac Butt, Charles Stewart Parnell, and\r\nJoseph Biggar.\r\n\r\nMr. Biggar and I were always great friends. He had the reputation of\r\nbeing close-fisted and penurious; but that this was not so I knew from\r\nmany circumstances, though it is quite true he would not allow himself\r\nto be defrauded of a penny.\r\n\r\nHe became a Catholic in his later days. Though such of us as were of\r\nthe household of the faith welcomed him into the fold, his conversion\r\ndid not increase his value in our eyes--indeed, from a political point\r\nof view, he was of more service to the cause as an Irish Protestant,\r\nthere being too few of them in our ranks. He had a fresh, pleasant,\r\nshrewd-looking face, and spoke with a decided northern accent, which had\r\nsomewhat of a metallic ring. Some of his brother Members of Parliament\r\nthought his \"obstruction\" methods highly ungentlemanly, but he believed\r\nin fighting England with her own weapons. If good Irish measures were\r\nnot allowed to pass, he would throw every obstacle in the way of English\r\nmeasures being carried. The tempest of rage that assailed him in the\r\n\"House\" only added to his popularity outside. Not only was he an immense\r\nfavourite amongst Irishmen, but with democratic Englishmen also; and at\r\ngreat mass meetings of English miners and agricultural labourers he\r\ncould always get resolutions carried by the honest, hard-handed sons of\r\ntoil in favour of the restoration of Ireland's rights.\r\n\r\nBiggar used to get many letters approving of the attitude he and Parnell\r\nhad taken up in Parliament. One in particular, from a warm admirer, he\r\nused to show to his friends with great glee. It was a song in the old\r\n\"Come-all-ye\" style. A few lines I can remember sang in words of high\r\ncommendation of--\r\n\r\n  --Joseph Biggar,\r\n  That man of rigour,\r\n  Whose form and figure\r\n    Do foes appal!\r\n\r\nMy place being the head-quarters of the Confederation at this time, the\r\nfact of my being known to be generally on the spot made me a kind of\r\n\"man in the gap,\" to fill up engagements likely to fall through for want\r\nof a speaker. In this way I was often rushed off to distant parts of the\r\ncountry at the shortest notice.\r\n\r\nThe most important Irish event in 1875 was the celebration of the\r\nO'Connell Centenary in Dublin, on Friday, August 6th. Our Confederation\r\nwas well represented in the processions, there being, as might be\r\nexpected from its proximity, a large contingent from Liverpool. So great\r\nwas the rush to cross the Channel for the celebration that we chartered\r\nseveral of the fine steamers of the City of Dublin Company, and kept\r\nthem for several days fully employed in crossing and recrossing.\r\n\r\nThe pity of it was that there should be two processions--the magnificent\r\ndisplay organised by the official Centenary Committee and the procession\r\ngot up by the Amnesty Association.\r\n\r\nThe speeches of Messrs. Butt, Sullivan, and Power on the platform\r\nerected in what was then Sackville Street, when the outdoor display\r\nbroke up, explained why the Amnesty Committee and their friends\r\nconsidered that a protest was necessary and justifiable--hence the\r\nsecond procession. The chief objections to the action of the official\r\ncommittee were that, while all honour was to be paid to the memory of\r\nO'Connell as the Liberator of his Catholic fellow-countrymen, his\r\nservices as the champion of the political freedom of the Irish people\r\nwere being kept in the background. Also--and that was why the Amnesty\r\nAssociation for the release of political prisoners took the initiative\r\nin the protest against the action of the Centenary Committee--because,\r\non a great national occasion like this, the very existence of the\r\nmartyrs for freedom, who were suffering in English prisons, appeared to\r\nbe forgotten. Such forgetfulness was considered at the least highly\r\ninappropriate.\r\n\r\nThere was much indignation, too, that Lord O'Hagan should have been\r\nchosen to speak the panegyric on O'Connell, seeing that he had actually\r\nsentenced some of those very prisoners.\r\n\r\nThe Irish organisation in Great Britain sympathised with these views,\r\nand the various branches sending contingents showed their feelings by\r\nthrowing in their part with the Amnesty Association.\r\n\r\nThe contingent from Great Britain was, on the proposition of Mr. Patrick\r\nEgan, given the place of honour in front of the amnesty procession\r\nwhich, on the morning of the Centenary celebration, the 6th of August,\r\n1875, started from Beresford Place, near the Custom House. The banners\r\nof the three Liverpool branches were a picturesque feature in the\r\nprocession, as also was the Sarsfield Band, a body of fine young\r\nLiverpool Irishmen who headed our contingent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nHOME RULE IN LOCAL ELECTIONS--PARNELL SUCCEEDS BUTT AS PRESIDENT OF THE\r\nIRISH ORGANISATION IN GREAT BRITAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was at the Liverpool Municipal Elections of 1875 that we first\r\nintroduced the question of Home Rule into local politics. When we were\r\nholding our inaugural meeting to establish the Home Rule organisation in\r\nthe town, we could not get any of our Irish public men to take the\r\nchair. The reason was that these had not been elected as Irishmen but as\r\nLiberals. As a matter of fact, we had in Dr. Commins a man immensely\r\nsuperior to any of them. But we thought that men who had been elected to\r\npublic positions mainly by Irish votes should not refuse to identify\r\nthemselves with the national movement, and to help it by whatever\r\ninfluence they possessed. We therefore decided to _make_ some public\r\nmen. In Scotland and Vauxhall Wards we had a clear majority, but though\r\nthe Irish vote in these wards was expected for Liberal candidates, who\r\nwere not Irish or Catholic, in no other ward could a Catholic or\r\nIrishman be elected. We, therefore, commenced to make a change by\r\nputting forward for Scotland Ward one of our own men, Lawrence Connolly,\r\nas a Home Ruler, and elected him _as such_. He afterwards sat in the\r\nImperial Parliament for an Irish constituency. His election was followed\r\nin succeeding years by that of other Home Rulers, so that there was soon\r\na considerable Nationalist Party in the City Council, and no lack of\r\npublic men to do the honours for the Irishmen of Liverpool when any\r\ndistinguished fellow-countryman came amongst them. Their civic utility\r\nwas very great.\r\n\r\nThough I have been over twenty years out of Liverpool, I have never lost\r\nsight of what has been going on there, and I am pleased to find that the\r\nyounger generation--men whom we, the elders, have borne some share in\r\ntraining--have improved upon our work, and that there are now\r\nconsiderably more aldermen and city councillors than in our time.\r\n\r\nThat they are doing good work I am well satisfied, and nothing gives me\r\ngreater pleasure than to read from time to time in the papers such items\r\nas a recent one--the presentation of a congratulatory address from the\r\nlocal branches of the United Irish League to Councillor Thomas Burke on\r\nthe occasion of his being made a magistrate of the city of Liverpool. I\r\nam somewhat proud of Tom Burke. I remember having charge of some\r\nelection that was going on, and his coming to me, a very small boy, from\r\nBlundell Street, to offer his services. I put him in harness at once,\r\nand he has been at work in the Cause ever since, and it is with pleasure\r\nthat I recognise the fact that he is a good type of numerous Irishmen\r\nwho were either born in Liverpool or spent most of their lives in that\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nThere was a dear old _Soggarth_ at St. Joseph's, who did good service\r\nfor us in our first municipal election in Scotland Ward. He had,\r\nprevious to this, been a fellow priest with my uncle, Father Bernard\r\nO'Loughlin, in the Isle of Man. As Father Peter McGrath was a good Irish\r\nscholar, he was soon able to make himself understood by such of the Manx\r\npeople as still retained their native speech, its basis being, like the\r\nlanguage spoken in the Scottish Highlands, practically--making allowance\r\nfor provincialisms--the Gaelic spoken in Ireland. This was a great help\r\nto him and his brother priest in disarming prejudice.\r\n\r\nBefore I met Father McGrath in Liverpool I had heard from my uncle of\r\nhis delightful and saintly character. He was a ministering angel among\r\nour people in his district, which was one of the poorest in Liverpool.\r\nHis charity was unbounded. Going on a sick call and being at the end of\r\nhis monetary resources--for let his friends give him ever so much he\r\nwould never leave himself a penny--he had been known to give away his\r\nown underclothing, and even to carry away his bed-clothes to relieve\r\nsome case of abject poverty.\r\n\r\nHe was a thorough Nationalist, and was delighted when we first raised\r\nthe banner of Home Rule in Scotland Ward and made honest Lawrence\r\nConnolly our standard bearer. As part of the Ward was in his district,\r\nhe was by far the best canvasser we had. Day by day he used to call on\r\nme to hear of the progress we were making. With the active personal\r\nhelp and the prayers of a saintly man like Father McGrath how could we\r\nlose?\r\n\r\nThe return of a Home Ruler at an English municipal election was the\r\nforerunner of a still greater victory won in the same Scotland Ward,\r\nwhich as a Division of the Parliamentary Borough of Liverpool returned\r\nto Parliament some ten years afterwards the only Irish Home Ruler who,\r\n_as such_, sits for a British constituency--Mr. T.P. O'Connor.\r\n\r\nAt the Annual Convention of the Home Rule Confederation, held in the\r\nRotunda, Dublin, August 21st, 1876, Dr. Commins in the chair, a vote of\r\nconfidence in Mr. Butt was passed. At the same time what was known as\r\nthe \"Obstruction\" policy was endorsed, though Mr. Butt had given its\r\nchief exponents, Biggar and Parnell, no countenance. It was also\r\nresolved to remove the headquarters of the Confederation from Liverpool\r\nto London.\r\n\r\nAlthough, out of respect for his distinguished services, Mr. Butt was\r\nallowed to remain as the nominal leader up to the time of his death, it\r\nis quite evident that our people favoured the more active policy of the\r\nyounger men.\r\n\r\nAt a banquet given on the night of this Convention in the Ancient\r\nConcert Room, Mr. Butt, as chairman, gave the toast of \"The Queen, Lords\r\nand Commons of Ireland.\" It will be seen elsewhere that I have always\r\nobjected to join in this toast on the ground that it implies an\r\nacceptance of the existing condition of government in Ireland. Finding\r\nit on the list, I remained away, but I am afraid my friends, who knew my\r\nviews, were scandalized at seeing in the newspaper report my name given\r\nas having been present. How it occurred was through the reporter,\r\ndesiring, no doubt, to save himself the trouble of making out a new\r\nlist, giving the names of those who had been present at the Convention\r\nas having attended the banquet. I had a somewhat similar experience at a\r\nNewcastle-on-Tyne Convention--sixteen years later. The Newcastle men, in\r\nthe interval between the Convention and the banquet, asked my opinion\r\nabout the toast list. I gave them a sketch of what I thought a good one,\r\nbut said, \"Don't have the Queen.\" They said they wouldn't, and I went to\r\nthe banquet. I was surprised to hear the chairman giving \"The Queen,\r\nLords and Commons of Ireland.\" There was nothing for me to do but walk\r\nout.\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Parnell Mr. Biggar found a colleague after his own heart in\r\nworking the \"Obstruction\" policy. From the time when I made the\r\nacquaintance of Parnell, when he came amongst us, a shy-looking young\r\nman, under the wing of Isaac Butt, we were drawn towards each other--he\r\nbecause he looked upon me, from my life-long experience of them, as an\r\nauthority upon our people in this country, and I because I was impressed\r\nby the terrible earnestness that I soon recognised underlying the young\r\nman's apparently impassive and unemotional exterior. I was one of the\r\nfirst he came in contact with in this country, and I believe he unbent\r\nhimself and showed more of his really enthusiastic nature to me than he\r\ndid to most men. He used to speak unreservedly to me. He knew my views\r\nas to Irishmen taking the oath of allegiance and entering the British\r\nParliament, of which he was at that time a member. He knew that, holding\r\nthese views, I could not enter the British Parliament myself, though he\r\nwould have liked to see me there. With me it was a matter of conscience;\r\nI could not take an oath of allegiance to any but an Irish Government.\r\nAt the same time, I have always been practical, and willing to fight\r\nIreland's battles with the weapons that come readiest to my hand. I,\r\ntherefore, always gave what support I could to the Irish Parliamentary\r\nParty, who could conscientiously enter the House of Commons, and to the\r\nrecognised Irish organisations for the time being.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be expected that every Irishman, even every Irish\r\nNationalist, will be of one mind as to which way his duty lies in\r\nserving his country. After all, a man who can honestly say \"I am an\r\nIrishman and I love my country\" is already nine-tenths of the way to\r\nbeing a Nationalist. If such a man tries to do his best, according to\r\nhis lights, for Ireland, he is entitled to all possible sympathy from\r\neven those who are working on other lines.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, when Parnell had returned from a special mission to\r\nAmerica, I had a long discussion with him on these points, and was bound\r\nto admit that the British Government would have been much better pleased\r\nto encounter an insurrection in Ireland, which they could easily put\r\ndown, than the policy of the so-called \"Obstructionists\" in Parliament.\r\nAgain, I said, there was another fact which I recognised. This was that\r\nhis being sent on a mission to America, whence he was then returning,\r\nshowed the value of having a man holding such a well-recognised position\r\nas a member of Parliament, elected by the votes of his\r\nfellow-countrymen, in case we had to send a representative to speak in\r\nthe name of Ireland to some other nation, a circumstance which had\r\nhappened before and might again. I said this, even taking into account\r\nthe apparent failure of the mission to America, from which he was\r\nreturning, for circumstances might arise in which the head of a State\r\nmight be glad to recognise an embassy like theirs. He told me that was\r\nexactly how he viewed the subject.\r\n\r\nIt was in Dr. Commins' office that we had this conversation, and at our\r\nrequest Mr. Parnell postponed his departure to Ireland in order to\r\nattend a celebration we were having that night of Home Rule victories we\r\nhad achieved in two wards of the town, in Vauxhall by the return of Dr.\r\nCommins to the Town Council, and in Scotland Ward by the election of Dr.\r\nAlexander Bligh. Parnell's appearance at our festival, which was held on\r\nMonday, November 13th, 1876, was a pleasing surprise to those present,\r\nwho were not aware of his return from America, and this added to the\r\nintensity of the outburst of joy and enthusiastic applause which greeted\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important of our Annual Conventions in Great Britain was\r\nthat held in Liverpool on 27th August, 1877. Everything showed that,\r\nwhile our people in Ireland and here still loved the old leader, they\r\nfavoured the policy of \"Obstruction.\" At this Convention there was no\r\nintention of displacing Mr. Butt from his position as President of the\r\norganisation. They would have retained him on account of his\r\ndistinguished services and eminently lovable character. But the old man\r\nhimself could see plainly enough that the people wanted to move faster\r\nthan he was willing to lead, and, notwithstanding the appeals made to\r\nhim, insisted upon resigning his position. The Convention being\r\ncompelled to accept his resignation, Charles Stewart Parnell was elected\r\nPresident of the organisation in his place. This was an indication of\r\nwhat was likely to follow, for though Mr. Butt retained the nominal\r\nleadership of the Irish Parliamentary Party up to the time of his death,\r\nParnell was the real leader, and eventually, after a short interval,\r\nwhen Mr. Shaw held the office, became the Chairman of the Irish\r\nParliamentary Party.\r\n\r\nJohn Ferguson was, I think, the first man publicly to indicate Parnell\r\nas the probable successor of Butt. But so great is the dread in our\r\npeople of even the semblance of disunion, that many, myself among the\r\nnumber, expostulated with him for this. Events, however, showed he was\r\nright, and Mr. Butt himself plainly felt that it was inevitable. But at\r\nthe Convention, when Butt had distinctly refused to hold the office of\r\nPresident any longer, nothing could be finer than the tribute paid to\r\nour retiring leader by Mr. John Ferguson in proposing the election of\r\nMr. Parnell as his successor. As I was asked to take the official\r\naccount of that Convention, and have kept a record of it, I here give a\r\nfew words of his and some of the other speeches. He said:--\r\n\r\n     It is my intention to propose Mr. Parnell as the head of the\r\n     Confederation. At the same time I feel the greatest possible regret\r\n     that our grand old chieftain who, in trying times, raised the Irish\r\n     banner, who has so long guided us, and who has been with us in so\r\n     many hard fights, is to retire from amongst us. We are grateful to\r\n     Issac Butt for leading us so far, but we are going to try a more\r\n     determined policy, and Mr. Butt holds views different from those we\r\n     are determined to carry out. I hope, though, he will take counsel\r\n     with the true and earnest men of the Party, and that, after a time,\r\n     he will return to lead us at this side of the water.\r\n\r\nMr. John Barry, Mr. Biggar and others spoke in the same strain.\r\n\r\nSo also did Mr. Parnell, who, concluding his speech seconding the vote\r\nof thanks to Mr. Butt, said:--\r\n\r\n     I must confess to not having Mr. Butt's confidence in English\r\n     justice and sense of right. It is not too late for him to see a way\r\n     to deal with England that will obtain freedom for our country--a\r\n     way that will show England that, if she will dare to trifle with\r\n     Irish demands, it will be at the risk of endangering those\r\n     institutions she feels so proud of, but which Irishmen have no\r\n     reason to respect. To Mr. Butt is due a debt of gratitude by the\r\n     Irish people which they can never repay, for he has taught them\r\n     self-reliance and knowledge of their power. If I have felt it my\r\n     duty to put myself in antagonism with Mr. Butt I hope he will\r\n     forgive me. If I have said or written harsh things I have never\r\n     said more nor less than was due to the gravity of the occasion.\r\n\r\nMr. O'Donnell, who expressed a wish that the next session might find Mr.\r\nButt at the head of a United Irish Party, supported the vote of thanks\r\nto Mr. Butt, which was carried unanimously, and with all sincerity and\r\ndepth of feeling.\r\n\r\nMr. Butt replied, saying he would be ashamed of himself if he were\r\nunmoved by that vote, and the manner in which it had been passed. He\r\nhoped that the wish expressed by Mr. O'Donnell might be realized, and it\r\nwould not be his fault if they had not a United Irish Party in the House\r\nof Commons. After expressing his good wishes for the Home Rule\r\nConfederation of Great Britain, which he hoped might long continue to\r\nassert the power of the Irish people in this country, he took his\r\nfarewell.\r\n\r\nMr. Parnell was then elected President.\r\n\r\nThe Convention of 1877 ended with the adoption of a resolution, on the\r\nmotion of Mr. Peter Mulhall (Liverpool), seconded by Mr. Ryan (Bolton):--\r\n\r\n     That this Convention of the Home Rule Confederation of Great\r\n     Britain hereby endorses the vigorous policy of the Home Rule\r\n     Parliamentary Party who are termed \"Obstructionists.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Mulhall just mentioned was an active worker in the National ranks in\r\nLiverpool, and even a more valuable adherent a little later was his\r\nyounger brother James, one of the most thorough, sincere, and upright of\r\nour young men, who never spared himself when there was good work to do.\r\n\r\nBefore the venerable figure of Isaac Butt disappears from the scene, let\r\nme say a few words about his eminently agreeable personality.\r\n\r\nThere was not an atom of selfishness about him. I remember his making\r\nlittle of the difficulties some people used to raise in connection with\r\nthe planning of a Home Rule Bill, and saying, \"Three men sitting round a\r\ntable could in a short time draw up a plan of Home Rule for Ireland that\r\nwould act, providing people all round meant honestly.\"\r\n\r\nHe used to tell us humorous anecdotes of his experiences in the courts,\r\nof which I can recollect the following one: \"A man came before a\r\nmagistrate to have a neighbour bound over to keep the peace. In his\r\ndeposition he stated after the usual preamble: 'That said Barney Trainor\r\nat said time and place threatened to send said deponent's soul to the\r\nlowest pit of Hell, and this deponent veribly believes that had it not\r\nbeen for the interference of the bystanders the aforesaid Barney Trainor\r\nwould have accomplished his horrible purpose.'\"\r\n\r\nAnother story that I remember him telling was as to the origin of \"Bog\r\nLatin.\" A sheriff's officer was sent to serve a writ, but the object of\r\nhis search took refuge in a bog. The sheriff's officer, determined to do\r\nthe thing properly, endorsed his writ \"Non comeatibus in swampo,\" and in\r\nIrish legal circles the term \"Bog Latin\" was thereafter used to describe\r\nany mode of caricature of the ancient tongue.\r\n\r\nIn something less than two years after Charles Stewart Parnell had\r\nsucceeded him as our President, Isaac Butt died, on the 5th of May,\r\n1879, mourned by Ireland as one of the most brilliant, patriotic, and\r\nself-sacrificing men she had ever nurtured.\r\n\r\nOf the members of Parliament and embryo members present at the 1877\r\nConvention, I should say a word of Tim Healy, by which name he is most\r\nfrequently known, who, since then, has been on many occasions one of the\r\nmost prominent figures in Irish politics.\r\n\r\nFrom the day when I first met him, a keen, quick-witted, enthusiastic\r\nIrish lad of about 18, from Newcastle-on-Tyne, until this 1877\r\nConvention and later, he did good work for the Cause. Great as is my\r\naffection for him, my pain at his attitude in recent years has been as\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\nFrom the time we began to work together in the Home Rule movement I\r\nshould say that Timothy Healy had not left his native place, Bantry,\r\nmore than a couple of years.\r\n\r\nHe is related to the Sullivan family, the connection being still closer\r\nfrom the fact that his wife is a daughter of our veteran poet, T.D.\r\nSullivan, for whom I have always had the warmest admiration.\r\n\r\nLike myself, Healy had a leaning towards journalism, and we had a common\r\nground in our admiration of the \"Nation\" newspaper, not only the\r\n\"Nation\" of O'Connell and the Young Irelanders, but of the Sullivans.\r\n\r\nNothing, therefore, could be more congenial to him than to fill the post\r\nof London letter writer to that paper.\r\n\r\nHe made his mark at once, as being a worthy scholar of the \"Nation\"\r\nschool, both past and present, and no one recognised this more quickly\r\nthan Charles Stewart Parnell. It was no doubt this appreciation that\r\nprompted the new Irish leader to ask Tim Healy to become his private\r\nsecretary.\r\n\r\nParnell possessed in a remarkable degree a gift which was of great\r\nservice to him during his political career as the successor of Isaac\r\nButt. This was the faculty of weighing up the special qualities of the\r\nvarious members of the Irish Party and using them accordingly. Without\r\nattempting for a moment to underrate Parnell as a great leader of men, I\r\nmust say that there were members of the Party far abler in many respects\r\nthan he was, and, no doubt, in looking around for someone to supply the\r\nqualities in which he, himself, was wanting, he could see that Healy was\r\nthe very man for his purpose.\r\n\r\nWhen he was in America he wired to Tim offering him the post, which\r\noffer was at once accepted, and, in the shortest possible time,\r\nParnell's new secretary had crossed the Atlantic, and was by his side\r\nready to be put in harness at once. It was an excellent combination, and\r\nthere can be no doubt but that, during the time that the connection\r\nexisted between them, Parnell owed much towards the successful carrying\r\non of the national struggle to his young secretary's inspiration.\r\n\r\nMichael Davitt, in his \"Fall of Feudalism,\" pays a high tribute to\r\nHealy's splendid service in connection with Gladstone's Land Act.\r\nUndoubtedly his was the credit for what became known as the \"Healy\r\nClause,\" which provided that no rent should be payable for land on\r\nimprovements made by the tenant himself or his immediate predecessor.\r\nNot only was this credit conceded to him of being the author of this\r\nclause by distinguished fellow-countrymen like Michael Davitt and Lord\r\nRussell of Killowen, but by Mr. Gladstone himself.\r\n\r\nAs I have referred to the opinions expressed on Healy in Michael\r\nDavitt's book, perhaps I may be forgiven if I go out of my way somewhat\r\nin referring to another passage in the same book, in which he pays a\r\nwell-deserved tribute to a noble Irishman, Patrick Ford, of the New York\r\n\"Irish World,\" with which, in common with Irish Nationalists the world\r\nover, I cordially agree. There are some men whom you may never have seen\r\nin the flesh, but whom you feel, through correspondence with them and in\r\nother ways, that you know none the less thoroughly all the same. Such a\r\nman is Patrick Ford. It is nearly forty years since I first made his\r\nacquaintance, and the years that have passed have only increased my\r\nregard for him.\r\n\r\nI had the pleasure of welcoming in the columns of the \"Catholic Times,\"\r\nwhich was then under my direction, the first number of the \"Irish\r\nWorld.\" I could feel at once that the paper and the man who edited it\r\nhad for me a congenial ring about them. I am deeply indebted for the\r\nkindly and generous interest which Patrick Ford has so long personally\r\nand in the columns of the \"Irish World\" shewn in the success of my Irish\r\npublications, and I am delighted to have the opportunity of joining in\r\nthe tribute paid to him by Michael Davitt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL DAVITT'S RETURN FROM PENAL SERVITUDE--PARNELL AND THE \"ADVANCED\"\r\nORGANISATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year following the Liverpool Home Rule Convention of 1877, I had\r\nthe pleasure of welcoming back to freedom my old friend, Michael Davitt,\r\nafter he had been in penal servitude close upon eight years. He had been\r\nreleased, along with other Fenian prisoners, and, with Corporal\r\nChambers, came on April 28th, 1878, to a gathering we organised and held\r\nin the Adelphi Theatre, Liverpool, for the benefit of the liberated men,\r\nJohn O'Connor Power being the lecturer for the occasion, and Dr. Commins\r\nour chairman.\r\n\r\nMichael Davitt, on rising to speak, was received with a terrific\r\noutburst of cheering, again and again repeated.\r\n\r\nI was sitting immediately behind him on the platform, and I noticed,\r\nwhile he was speaking, a constant nervous twitching of his hand, which\r\nhe held behind his back, and he was evidently in a state of\r\nhighly-strung excitement. I was not surprised when we had that day a\r\npainful proof of how the prison treatment had undermined his\r\nconstitution. After the gathering we brought the released prisoners and\r\nthe principal speakers to be entertained at the house of Patrick Byrne,\r\na warm-hearted, patriotic Irishman, and were much alarmed when Davitt\r\nfell into a deep faint, from which he only recovered through the\r\nministrations of one of our most respected Liverpool Nationalists, Dr.\r\nBligh, who fortunately was present. For a few moments it seemed as if he\r\nnever would revive.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt but that their treatment during their long term of\r\npenal servitude seriously affected the health of several of the Irish\r\npolitical prisoners. It was only three months previous to his visit to\r\nus in Liverpool that Davitt reached Dublin, with three others of the\r\nreleased prisoners--Sergeant McCarthy, Corporal Chambers, and John\r\nO'Brien. To the consternation of his friends, McCarthy died suddenly at\r\nMorrison's Hotel, on January 15th, the cause, it was believed, being\r\nheart disease. This caused such a shock to Chambers that his life, too,\r\nwas put in danger. I was pleased to see him restored to health after\r\nthis when he called on me in Liverpool with his brother, with whom I was\r\nwell acquainted. The shock of the sudden death of his friend McCarthy\r\nmust have affected Michael Davitt too, as we found from the report of\r\nour friend, Dr. Bligh, in what a precarious state of health he must have\r\nbeen at the time. It will be remembered that Rickard Burke became\r\ninsane, it was thought, and stated in Parliament, owing to his treatment\r\nwhile in Chatham Prison.\r\n\r\nFollowing our Liverpool gathering, we had on Sunday, May 5th, a meeting\r\nin the St. Helens Theatre for the same object. At this Parnell as well\r\nas Davitt was present. Speaking that day by desire of our St. Helens\r\nfriends, I called attention to the appropriateness of our addressing the\r\nassembly from the boards of a theatre on which there had been the mimic\r\nrepresentation of many a stirring drama. But no play the audience had\r\never witnessed on those boards could exceed in dramatic interest the\r\nlife of the released convict, Michael Davitt. Nay, more, the grudging\r\nterms on which he had been released enabled him to appear that day in\r\nthe real living character of a \"Ticket-of-Leave-Man,\" which, no doubt,\r\nthey had seen impersonated on those boards by some clever actor in the\r\nplay of the same name.\r\n\r\nI am reminded of that St. Helens meeting by a passage in Michael\r\nDavitt's book \"The Fall of Feudalism in Ireland.\" I travelled from\r\nLiverpool to St. Helens to attend the meeting in the same carriage with\r\nMr. Parnell. As I could always speak unreservedly to him I knew that\r\nthough he would not actually join the advanced organisation, he regarded\r\nit as a useful force behind the constitutional movement. In the\r\ncarriage, which it so happened we had to ourselves, we discussed the\r\nprobabilities of the result of a resort to physical force for securing\r\nIrish freedom, should circumstances justify such a course, for Parnell\r\nwould not have shrunk from taking the field if there had been a\r\nreasonable hope of success. Singularly enough, I find in Michael\r\nDavitt's book that he himself, on the day of that same St. Helens\r\nmeeting, made an advance to Parnell with a view to getting him to join\r\nthe revolutionary organisation, should the conditions be somewhat\r\nmodified. Up till then I had seen more of Parnell than Davitt had and\r\nhad enjoyed his full confidence. I had, therefore, come to the\r\nconclusion, from my conversations with him, that he was of far more\r\nservice to the Irish cause as he was than if he had actually joined the\r\nrevolutionary movement. I am not surprised, therefore, at Parnell's\r\nanswer to Davitt: \"No, I will never join any political secret society,\r\noath bound or otherwise. My belief is that useful things for our Cause\r\ncan be done in the British Parliament.\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I remember one public utterance of his which always struck\r\nme as most statesmanlike. After a frank statement that he was in favour\r\nof constitutional Home Rule, he, with equal frankness, declined to\r\nsubscribe to the entire finality of that solution of the Irish problem.\r\nHow, he asked, could he or any man put bounds to the progress of a\r\nnation?\r\n\r\nSeeing that Gladstone gave as one reason for the disestablishing of the\r\nIrish Church \"the intensity of Fenianism,\" so, in the same way, no one\r\nrecognised more than Parnell did that the existence of a physical force\r\nmovement was a strong argument for those engaged in the moral force\r\nagitation. Therefore he was always anxious to conciliate and even\r\ncultivate the advanced element. Of this I will here give one\r\nillustration, out of many I could mention, and this in connection with\r\nthe custom of drinking what was called \"the loyal toast,\" which at one\r\ntime used to be observed at some Home Rule celebrations. It is a matter\r\non which I have already explained my point of view.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion Mr. Parnell was invited by the Liverpool branches to a\r\nSt. Patrick's Day banquet at the Adelphi Hotel, where the drinking of\r\nthe \"loyal\" toast was part of the programme. With the rest of the\r\ncommittee I met him at the railway station on his arrival, and came with\r\nhim to the hotel. After some conversation I was bidding him\r\n\"good-night!\" when he asked, as he took my hand, \"Where are you going,\r\nDenvir? Are you not going to stay for the banquet?\" I had not intended\r\nmentioning it, but as he asked me so pointedly, I felt bound to tell him\r\nmy objection to being present. He did not attempt to controvert what I\r\nsaid, but still asked where I was going. I then told him I had been\r\ninvited to a St. Patrick's celebration where the toast was _not_ to be\r\ndrunk, the gathering being one of our advanced Nationalist friends.\r\n\r\nHe at once said \"I should like to go there.\" I told him I was sure they\r\nwould be delighted to see him, and that, as theirs was a dance, and it\r\nwould be kept up pretty late, I would come back for him after the\r\nbanquet, and take him to the other celebration. Our friends were well\r\npleased at his wish to attend, and asked me to go back and bring him to\r\nwhere a hearty _cead mile failte_ awaited him. In due time I brought him\r\nover, and they gave him an enthusiastic reception, he being quite as\r\ndelighted to be present as they were to receive him, and they were\r\nstill more pleased when he addressed a few words to them.\r\n\r\nBut that was as far as Parnell would go, and his answer to Davitt that\r\nday at St. Helens pretty well indicated the course he intended to pursue\r\nin connection with the cause of Ireland.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it is on record that in later years Michael Davitt altered his\r\nown view to such an extent that he would no longer have made that\r\nproposition to Parnell.\r\n\r\nThere was no man whose regard I more valued than that of Michael Davitt.\r\nAmongst all the vicissitudes of Irish politics our friendship was an\r\nunbroken one. He was little more than a boy when I first met him at a\r\nsmall gathering to which none but the initiated were admitted. From the\r\nfirst I was strongly drawn towards that tall, dark-complexioned,\r\nbright-eyed, modest youth, with his typical Celtic face and figure. He\r\nwas in company with Arthur Forrester, who was a fluent speaker and\r\nwriter, and who on this occasion did most of the talking, Davitt only\r\nthrowing in some shrewd remark from time to time. We know since that he\r\nhad in him the natural gift of oratory, though it was not that so much\r\nas other qualities which gave him the commanding position in Irish\r\npolitics which he afterwards reached.\r\n\r\nHe had then spent several of the best years of his life in penal\r\nservitude for his connection with the physical force movement. Thinking\r\nlong and hard in the solitude of his prison cell, Davitt resolved that\r\nthe first vital need of Ireland was to plant firmly in the soil of\r\nIreland the people who were being uprooted--in other words, the land\r\nsystem must be changed.\r\n\r\nThe result of his convictions was the formation of the Irish National\r\nLand League, which dated its birth from the great meeting projected by\r\nDavitt and held at Irishtown in April, 1879. Mr. Parnell was elected\r\nPresident of the new organisation, Mr. Patrick Egan treasurer, and\r\nMichael Davitt was one of the secretaries. He has been justly called the\r\n\"Father\" of the Land League.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest acts of the Land League was to endeavour to stop the\r\ntide of emigration from Ireland. In this connection, as certain\r\nemigration schemes had been set on foot in England, a branch of the\r\nLeague was founded in Liverpool at my request by Parnell and Davitt.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the prevailing distress and impending famine, Mr.\r\nParnell was asked by the Irish National League to go to America to get\r\nthe assistance of our people there, and Mr. John Dillon was asked to\r\naccompany him.\r\n\r\nThough there was little done by the Government to relieve the distress,\r\nthe Irish people could always get coercion without stint, and Messrs.\r\nDavitt, Daly and Killen were arrested for \"seditious\" speeches in\r\nconnection with the Land League agitation.\r\n\r\nTo protest against this, Mr. Parnell, previous to his departure for\r\nAmerica, attended a great open-air demonstration in Liverpool. The\r\ngathering was held in the open space in front of St. George's Hall, and\r\nit was computed that about 50,000 people were present. When the meeting\r\nwas publicly announced, there was a proclamation from the Orange\r\nSociety, calling upon the brethren to put down the \"Seditious\r\ngathering.\" Upon this our committee took the precaution of enrolling\r\nstalwart \"stewards\" to preserve order. Among those who offered their\r\nservices were a large number of the Irish Volunteer Corps, under the\r\ncommand of Sergeant James MacDonnell, a County Down man of fine\r\nproportions and shrewd brain. To him was entrusted the direction of the\r\nwhole body of our men on the day of the meeting. The advanced party also\r\ngave their services, and non-commissioned officers and men of the other\r\nvolunteer corps besides the Irish, skilled in military movements, gave\r\nvaluable help. Round the platform were a select body of nearly a\r\nthousand men, many of them carrying revolvers in their pockets, ready\r\nfor action.\r\n\r\nThe Orange body must have heard of our elaborate preparations, and\r\nfinding \"discretion the better part of valour,\" they countermanded their\r\nproclamation to break up the meeting.\r\n\r\nThe authorities of the town made full preparations to cope with possible\r\ndisturbances, and inside St. George's Hall they had, carefully kept out\r\nof view, a large body of the town police, armed with revolvers in\r\naddition to their batons. In a window of the North Western Hotel,\r\noverlooking the meeting, was the chief constable, and with him were\r\nmagistrates, prepared to read the Riot Act if necessary.\r\n\r\nIt was arranged that as I was at that time probably the best known man\r\nin the Irish body in Liverpool, I should be stationed on a prominent\r\npart of the platform, which consisted of two lorries, in view of all,\r\nand alongside me, our general, Sergeant MacDonnell. As showing how well\r\nin hand was that immense body of people it was remarked that when the\r\ncarriage of Dr. John Bligh, whose guest Mr. Parnell was, drew up in the\r\nstreet, facing the platform, and when I made a motion with both hands,\r\nto show where a passage was to be made for Mr. Parnell from the street\r\nto the platform, how quickly and accurately the opening was made in that\r\ndense and apparently impenetrable body of people.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland, at this time, men were being prosecuted for what were termed\r\n\"seditious\" speeches. When Mr. Parnell stood up to speak he stepped upon\r\na chair, that he might be the better seen, and said \"I am going to make\r\na seditious speech.\" A strong motion was passed at this meeting\r\ncondemnatory of coercion in Ireland. On the same evening a great\r\ndemonstration was held in the League Hall.\r\n\r\nThe authorities must have considered the St. George's Hall meeting a\r\nvery serious business, and it was evidently made note of by the police\r\nfor use afterwards.\r\n\r\nAt the \"_Times_ Forgeries Commission,\" Mr. Parnell was questioned about\r\nthis gathering, and about several on the platform who were mentioned by\r\nname. Asked if this one or that one were connected with the Fenian\r\nmovement, he generally answered he did not think so. When my name was\r\nput to him by the Attorney-General (now the Lord Chief Justice), who was\r\ncross-examining him, he replied \"He might have been.\"\r\n\r\nIn a short time after the Liverpool demonstration Messrs. Parnell and\r\nDillon went to America, as had been arranged. They were everywhere\r\nreceived with enthusiasm, and obtained sympathy and substantial help as\r\nthe ambassadors of Ireland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nBLOCKADE RUNNING--ATTEMPTED SUPPRESSION OF \"UNITED IRELAND\"--WILLIAM\r\nO'BRIEN AND HIS STAFF IN JAIL--HOW PAT EGAN KEPT THE FLAG FLYING.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"United Ireland suppressed\" was the chief headline in the morning papers\r\non the Friday before the Christmas of 1881.\r\n\r\nIn point of fact, what had happened was that the detectives, acting\r\nunder the extraordinary powers given by the special \"law\" in force in\r\nIreland, had invaded the offices of the Land League organ the night\r\nbefore, and seized all the copies of the paper found on the premises.\r\n\r\nIt was a bungled job, for the country edition had already gone out,\r\nincluding the supplies for England and Scotland, so that the only copies\r\nseized were those intended for Dublin and the suburbs.\r\n\r\nNothing indicated the intensity of the struggle going on between the\r\ngovernment and the people more than the dead set which was being made\r\nagainst \"United Ireland.\" Its editor was in jail, its sub-editor was in\r\njail, most of its contributors were in jail, even the commercial and\r\nmechanical staffs had been seized, one by one, and in the paper each\r\nweek the names and descriptions of the victims appeared, prominently\r\nset out in tabular form, in the place where the first leading article\r\nhad previously been printed.\r\n\r\nBut, in spite of these difficulties, the paper appeared regularly each\r\nweek, its fiery spirit not a whit abated, and its outspoken exposure of\r\nMr. \"Buckshot\" Forster and his methods in no way curtailed. Confronted\r\nwith this open failure, the government swallowed the last vestige of its\r\nregard for appearances, and made the bold attack on the liberty of the\r\npress involved in the seizure and attempted suppression of \"United\r\nIreland.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not the first time (nor has it been the last) in Ireland that a\r\nnational organ was thus attacked. From the days of the United Irishmen,\r\ntowards the close of the 18th century, to those of 1867, there had been\r\na long series of suppressions, of which, perhaps, John Mitchel's \"United\r\nIrishman\" (1847) and the Fenian \"Irish People\" are the best remembered\r\ninstances.\r\n\r\nIn this case, however, the leaders of the popular movement determined\r\nthat they would not be put down, but would use all \"the resources of\r\ncivilization\"--to quote Mr. Gladstone's famous phrase--to keep the flag\r\nflying. I am very proud of the fact that they invited me to be their\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\nWhat happened was that two members of the printing staff, Mr. Edward\r\nDonnelly, foreman, and Mr. William MacDonnell, assistant foreman,\r\nescaped to England, taking with them stereo plates of the \"suppressed\"\r\nissue. From these plates, my own jobbing machines not being big enough\r\nto print a full-sized newspaper, I got a local firm to print sufficient\r\ncopies to cover the Dublin supply, which, as I have explained, had been\r\nthe only part of the issue which fell into the hands of the police. A\r\nquantity of these papers, made up in innocent looking parcels, my son,\r\nthen a schoolboy, took over with him in the steamer from Liverpool to\r\nDublin, as personal luggage. He was to take them to the address which\r\nhad been given to him of a member of the staff who was then \"on his\r\nkeeping.\" I was alarmed the following morning, Christmas Eve, 1881, to\r\nread in the newspapers of the arrest of this gentleman, and feared that\r\nmy son would also fall into the hands of the police. But he had acted\r\nwith wariness. Leaving the luggage behind him in the steamer, until he\r\nfound how the land lay, he saw the people of the house, heard of the\r\narrest, and at once made his own arrangements for supplying the Dublin\r\nnewsagents, in which task he received invaluable help from two gentlemen\r\non the \"Nation\" staff, Daniel Crilly and Eugene O'Sullivan.\r\n\r\nThus the _whole_ of the issue of the \"suppressed\" number actually\r\nreached its destination. For future issues arrangements were made\r\nbetween my old friend Mr. Patrick Egan, Treasurer of the Land League,\r\nwho was then in Paris, and myself. Our letters were never addressed\r\ndirect, but always through third persons, the intermediary in Paris\r\nbeing Mr. James Vincent Taaffe, and, in Liverpool, Miss Kate Swift. Mr.\r\nEgan had been sent to Paris to keep the League Funds out of the hands of\r\nDublin Castle, and to maintain intact the machinery of the League, for,\r\nit must be remembered, Parnell, Davitt, William O'Brien, and most of our\r\nprominent men were at the time in jail.\r\n\r\nAlthough illegal in Ireland, there was nothing in the ordinary law to\r\nprevent the printing and circulation of \"United Ireland\" in Great\r\nBritain. Arrangements were, therefore, made with the Metropolitan\r\nPrinting Works, London, for the future production of the paper. For\r\nseveral weeks the papers were printed by that firm, and sent to my place\r\nof business in Byrom Street, Liverpool.\r\n\r\nAs I had, in ordinary course, to supply the whole of the newsagents in\r\nEngland, Wales and Scotland, the police, by whom my place was, by day\r\nand night, closely watched, could not know if in the quantity sent to me\r\nfrom London I was getting a supply for Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe parcels for Ireland I could not send direct from Byrom Street, as\r\nthey would be followed by the police and traced. Therefore, for packing\r\nand forwarding to Ireland, we used a fish-curing shed, not far from\r\nByrom Street, lent for the purpose by a patriotic Irishman, Patrick De\r\nLacy Garton, at that time a member of the Liverpool City Council.\r\n\r\nWith so many friends in Liverpool willing to assist, it was not\r\ndifficult to get the parcels of papers, through one channel or another,\r\ninto our depot each week.\r\n\r\nI engaged the services of Mr. Michael Wolohan, to go to Ireland, and act\r\nas forwarding agent. It was his task to get people in various parts of\r\nthe country to receive parcels of \"United Ireland,\" the papers being\r\npacked in such fashion as to correspond with the business of the person\r\nto whom each consignment was made.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the edition for the week ending December 31st was packed\r\nin hampers provided by Mr. Garton, who advised me to send the lot as\r\ndried fish, and found a reliable consignee for them in Ireland. The\r\n\"dried fish\" arrived safely, and then the most arduous part of Michael\r\nWolohan's work began. For it was difficult to get the actual parcels of\r\n\"United Ireland\" into the hands of the agents and sub-agents unknown to\r\nthe police, but this he did with consummate address, and on the whole\r\nvery successfully.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion Michael wrote me he had a good consignee for \"woollen\r\ngoods.\" Nothing easier, for here was Edward Purcell, a clothier, one of\r\nour own young men, who afterwards became a city alderman, having a good\r\nbusiness in Byrom Street, Liverpool. Besides helping actively with the\r\n\"blockade running\" in other ways, he at once gave us the necessary\r\nwrappers in which he had got his own goods from his woollen merchants,\r\nand assisted in packing our \"woollen goods\" in the correct fashion.\r\nNeedless to say, these safely reached the consignee in Ireland.\r\n\r\nAlthough there was no illegality in printing \"United Ireland\" in London,\r\nthe printers were perpetually harassed by the police to frighten them\r\ninto giving up the job. The parcels for the British newsagents could not\r\nlegally be stopped, but with the watchful eye of the police all over\r\nIreland on the look-out for the proscribed paper, it is not surprising\r\nthat individual parcels fell into their hands. For that reason we took\r\ncare to send the various kinds of goods in the names of mercantile firms\r\nwhose loyalty was unquestionable. I should say that to this day these\r\nfirms have no idea of the large Irish trade they were doing at this\r\nparticular time.\r\n\r\nBut Liverpool became much too suspicious a place to send from. I\r\ntherefore adopted the plan of sending parcels, made up as various kinds\r\nof merchandise, to friends in Manchester, from which city there was\r\nregular communication with inland towns in Ireland, and these friends\r\nsent on the parcels to their destinations more safely than if going\r\ndirect from Liverpool.\r\n\r\nThis scheme was working smoothly enough, but eventually the London\r\nprinters were frightened into giving up the contract, and the printing\r\nhad to be transferred to Paris.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that, during this time, Michael Wolohan, our agent\r\nin Ireland (whose name had for the time being become Brownrigg), had the\r\nutmost difficulty in escaping the attention of the police. Some parcels\r\nhe was sending by the Broadstone terminus were detected and seized. What\r\ntroubled him most was that, as he paid a considerable sum for carriage\r\non these, and as the railway company had not forwarded them, he was\r\nentitled to have the money returned, But the police were on the look out\r\nfor the so-called Brownrigg, and it was thought best that he should not\r\nventure near the station. It happened that week that my son arrived in\r\nDublin with some more of the kind of luggage he had brought over at\r\nChristmas, and, with the recklessness of youth, he went to the station,\r\nand, as Brownrigg, got the money returned.\r\n\r\n\"United Ireland\" for the week ending January 28th, 1882, was printed in\r\nParis, in a section of a printing office rented by Patrick Egan, and\r\nsent, addressed to me, for circulation in Ireland and Great Britain. The\r\nparcels were seized on their arrival at Folkestone and Dover, and though\r\nthe seizure was illegal and I applied for the parcels as being my\r\nproperty (a question being also asked in Parliament) we could get no\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nBut, notwithstanding the seizures made from time to time, it was\r\ndetermined to keep the flag flying, and no matter what might be the\r\ndifficulty encountered in the production of \"United Ireland,\" not an\r\nissue was missed. Of course, as a natural consequence of these\r\ndifficulties, the paper was sometimes hard to be got, so that, taking\r\nadvantage of this, some of the newsvendors and all the newsboys in\r\nDublin were reaping a rich harvest, as, owing to the anxiety of the\r\npeople to get copies, they were frequently sold on the streets of the\r\ncities and towns in Ireland at from 6d. to 2s. 6d. a copy. The continued\r\npresence of the paper all over Ireland did perhaps more than anything\r\nelse to keep heart in the people. Accordingly, it must be kept going at\r\nall hazards. The type for the paper continued to be set up in Paris,\r\nand, after a certain quantity had been printed off each week, for\r\ntransmission by post and otherwise, the matrices from the type were\r\nbrought over to me by carefully selected agents from Paris. From these\r\nstereotype plates of the pages were cast. As my own machine was not big\r\nenough, I arranged with a Liverpool firm of printers to machine the\r\npaper for me each week. Accordingly, they printed the papers for the\r\nweek ending February 4th, and delivered the bulk of them to us, so that\r\nwe got our parcels for that week sent off.\r\n\r\nThe police must have got one of the copies being sold by the Liverpool\r\nagents, and finding it had no imprint (which was illegal) went to the\r\nprinters referred to, who, on this being pointed out, handed over to\r\nthem the few remaining copies.\r\n\r\nAs every printing firm was now afraid to touch \"United Ireland,\" it only\r\nremained for me to endeavour to print it with my own somewhat limited\r\nappliances. It was now, therefore, reduced in size to four pages. Every\r\nweek, as before, the matrices were brought to me, and, from the castings\r\ntaken from these, I printed the papers on my own small machine, and sent\r\nthem to their various destinations.\r\n\r\nAnd so the fight with the police went on with varying fortune. It was\r\ntrue, as regards size, half our flag had in a manner been shot away, but\r\nwe still kept it flying, and the Government, with their standing army of\r\npolice, were never able to suppress \"United Ireland.\"\r\n\r\nAs I expected, I was prosecuted for printing and publishing without an\r\nimprint. Mr. Poland, Q.C., chief prosecuting counsel to the Treasury,\r\nwas sent down to conduct the case against me for the technical breach of\r\nthe law involved in the matter of the imprint, and I was fined a sum\r\namounting with costs to £25. I announced my intention in court of\r\ncontinuing the publication, so the Government got very little\r\nsatisfaction out of their action.\r\n\r\nOf the various editions of the paper produced in Ireland at this time I\r\nshall not speak in detail, as in this narrative I only describe what\r\ncame within my own personal knowledge. Mr. William O'Brien in a later\r\nissue referred to the mysterious and unconquerable fashion in which one\r\ntown after another saw its edition of \"United Ireland\" appear, and then,\r\nwhen police and spies were hot upon its track, as mysteriously pass\r\naway. This was, of course, a picturesque exaggeration, but it had a\r\nconsiderable basis of truth. The paper was actually printed more than\r\nonce in the old office in Dublin under the noses of the police, and on\r\none occasion Mr. Wolohan set up a printing machine in a private house in\r\nDerry, and, assisted by my son, actually worked off the copies of the\r\npaper next door to the house of the resident magistrate.\r\n\r\nUltimately, there came the period of the \"Kilmainham Treaty,\" and most\r\nof the political prisoners were released. The issue of \"United Ireland\"\r\nfor March 11th did not appear as on previous occasions. I produced an\r\nissue, which I sent in charge of my son to Dublin, putting it at the\r\ndisposal of Mr. O'Brien. It was not, however, published, though I\r\nreceived a long and interesting letter from Mr. William O'Brien--still\r\nin Kilmainham jail--expressing the appreciation of the Irish leaders for\r\nthe work I had done in these words:--\r\n\r\n~We are all deeply sensible of your extraordinary energy and courage in\r\nthis matter.~\r\n\r\nI am prevented from giving this letter, which explains the reasons for\r\nthe stoppage of the paper, as Mr. O'Brien has endorsed it \"Private and\r\nConfidential.\"\r\n\r\nA few weeks later \"United Ireland\" appeared in its old publishing office\r\nin Abbey Street. Mr. O'Brien was set free on April 15th, Messrs.\r\nParnell, Dillon and O'Kelly were released on May 2nd, and Michael Davitt\r\nand others soon afterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nPATRICK EGAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that when \"United Ireland\" was \"on the shaughraun\"\r\nduring the time that William O'Brien was in prison, though he was able\r\nto send communications out regularly, the direction very largely\r\ndevolved upon Patrick Egan, who had taken up his quarters in Paris for\r\nthat and other purposes of the Land League. I may say that I have been\r\nin frequent communication with Mr. Egan ever since, and it is but\r\nrecently that I got a letter from him touching upon this matter. In\r\nmaking some valuable suggestions as to the contents of this book, he\r\nsays, \"There just occurs to me as I write, a point that you might\r\nintroduce as an added feature, namely--all the leading articles that\r\nappeared in 'U.I.' during those fateful months (or almost all of them)\r\nwere written by William O'Brien _in Kilmainham Prison, smuggled out by\r\nthe underground railroad, which ran upon regular scheduled time_, and\r\nwere despatched by trusty messengers to me in Paris, which messengers\r\nbrought back on their return journey the matrices to which you refer for\r\nthe next issue of 'United Ireland.'\r\n\r\n\"There were four messengers, in order to avoid attracting attention--two\r\nof them the Misses Stritch, whose father had been a resident magistrate\r\nin Ireland. They were fine patriotic girls, and active members of Miss\r\nAnna Parnell's Ladies' Land League. Both are now dead.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a time Patrick Egan returned from Paris to Ireland, calling upon\r\nme in Liverpool on his way home.\r\n\r\nOn more than one occasion he has visited me at my home in Liverpool. It\r\nwas always with sincere pleasure that I saw the alert figure, the keen\r\nyet smiling eyes, the trim moustache and beard, which were the first\r\nimpressions one got of his personality. His unvarying suavity and\r\npoliteness might have deceived a casual observer into supposing that he\r\nwas not a man of abnormal strength of character; they were only the\r\nsilken glove to conceal the hand of iron. Emphatically a man of\r\ndetermination and practical common sense, he united to these qualities a\r\nremarkable degree of tact. In addition to much routine matter, which\r\nneed not be specified here, although grave enough at the time, our\r\nmeetings were concerned with important work in which we were engaged,\r\nas, for instance, the O'Connell Centenary, the political prisoners, and\r\ncombating the measures being taken to swell the tide of emigration from\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with the eventful career of Patrick Egan may I be allowed to\r\ngo both backward and forward in my dates, in order to bring the story of\r\nhis life into, as far as possible, one consecutive narrative.\r\n\r\nBorn in County Longford, he was brought to Dublin by his parents when\r\nquite young. His shrewd business qualities enabled him to make his mark\r\nearly in life, and his fine administrative abilities admirably fitted\r\nhim for the post he attained as managing director to the most extensive\r\nflour milling company in Ireland.\r\n\r\nHe has always been a practical patriot, always ready to work for Ireland\r\nby every honourable means that came to his hand, whether the means were\r\nthose of moral or physical force. Consequently, he was an active worker\r\nin the ranks of the Irish Revolutionary Brotherhood from the early\r\nsixties. He was one of the founders of the Amnesty Movement for the\r\nrelease of the political prisoners of '65 and '67.\r\n\r\nWhen the Home Rule movement was started in Ireland he entered into it\r\nheartily, and was elected a member of the Council. He enjoyed the\r\nconfidence of Butt, John Martin, Justin McCarthy, and all the other\r\nleaders of the movement, besides being trusted by Nationalists of all\r\nshades of opinion. Like most of us, without abating in the least his\r\nlove and esteem for Isaac Butt, he soon recognised the coming leader in\r\nCharles Stewart Parnell, who used to refer to him in private\r\nconversation as his \"political godfather\" on account of the prominent\r\npart he had played in securing his first election to Parliament for the\r\nCounty Meath, in succession to John Martin.\r\n\r\nDuring the early part of the Land League agitation he was three times\r\nnominated, for King's County, Meath, and Tipperary, for Parliament, but\r\nhe refused election, on the ground of being an advanced Nationalist. I\r\nhave more than once talked this matter over with Pat Egan, and, as I may\r\nsay in everything else, we were in complete accord; we neither of us\r\ncould bring ourselves to swear allegiance to what we considered a\r\nforeign power. At the same time, as practical patriots, we helped every\r\nmovement, inside the constitution as well as outside of it, calculated\r\nto benefit Ireland.\r\n\r\nWhen the Land League movement was started in 1879, Egan became at once\r\none of the most prominent figures in it, and, besides acting as Trustee\r\nalong with Joseph Biggar and William H. O'Sullivan, he was Honorary\r\nTreasurer.\r\n\r\nIn the famous trial of the Land League Executive, in 1880-1881, he and\r\nMr. Parnell and eleven others were prosecuted, the jury being ten to two\r\nfor acquittal.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1881, when coercion was so rampant in Ireland, he left his\r\nbusiness in the sole charge of his partner, James Rourke, and went to\r\nParis, by desire of Parnell, Dillon and the other leaders, to keep the\r\nLeague Funds out of the hands of the enemy. While he was there I was\r\nbrought into close relations with him in my endeavours, as I have\r\nalready described in this narrative, to carry out the honourable part\r\nallotted to me by our leaders of keeping \"United Ireland\" in circulation\r\nin every corner of the land, notwithstanding the watchfulness of the\r\nentire British garrison.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1882, a National Convention passed a unanimous vote,\r\nthanking him for his distinguished services and sacrifices as Treasurer\r\nof the League, he having given gratuitously to the Cause three entire\r\nyears of his life, something like a million and a quarter of dollars\r\nhaving passed through his hands during that time. These and many other\r\ncircumstances that came to my knowledge abundantly prove that no man has\r\nmore deserved the confidence and gratitude of the Irish race.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1883, Michael Davitt tells us \"In order to avoid the\r\nmachinations of agents in the pay of Dublin Castle, he left Ireland.\"\r\n\r\nI don't know if I shall ever meet my friend again, and for that reason I\r\nshall always remember, as I am sure he will, our last meeting in\r\nLiverpool on his return from Paris, when we fought our battles with the\r\nforces of the Government over again, and had many a hearty laugh at some\r\nof the humorous episodes that cropped up in connection with it. Neither\r\nof us then thought that, before long, he would have to leave his home\r\nagain for another period of exile.\r\n\r\nUp to this point I can include the chief incidents in Patrick Egan's\r\ncareer, either directly or indirectly, in my own personal recollections.\r\nIn order not to break the continuity of this sketch of a noble life, I\r\nwill briefly speak of his career in America. It will be found,\r\ntherefore, that in some particulars I have had to anticipate the\r\nordinary course of this narrative.\r\n\r\nOn arriving in America in 1883, he settled in Nebraska, where he soon\r\nestablished a large and prosperous business in grain.\r\n\r\nIn 1884, at a Convention in Faneuil Hall, Boston, surrounded by some of\r\nthe most distinguished of our race in America, he was presented with a\r\nservice of plate sent from Ireland, with a beautifully illuminated\r\naddress, paying tribute to the magnificent services he had given to his\r\ncountry, and signed by three hundred of the national leaders in Ireland,\r\nincluding the Lord Mayor of Dublin (Charles Dawson), Parnell, Davitt,\r\nDillon, Biggar. Justin McCarthy, Healy, William O'Brien, Sexton,\r\nHarrington and others.\r\n\r\nFrom 1884 to 1886 he was President of the Irish National League of\r\nAmerica, during which time 360,000 dollars were collected and sent to\r\nIreland. The salary of the President of the League was 3,000 dollars a\r\nyear. At the end of his term Patrick Egan returned to his successor in\r\nthe office 6,000 dollars as his personal contribution to the Fund.\r\n\r\nHis career in America has been no less honourable than his services to\r\nthe Irish Cause on this side of the Atlantic. Irishmen everywhere felt\r\nproud when he was sent to represent the great American Republic as\r\nAmbassador to Chili. They took it not only as an honour to the man\r\nhimself, but to his nationality. We who knew him best followed with\r\nconfidence his record during the four years of storm and stress in\r\nChili, the most troublous, perhaps, that country had ever seen.\r\n\r\nThat our confidence in him was not misplaced was proved by the tribute\r\nof admiration paid him by President Harrison in his message to Congress\r\nin December, 1891, for the splendid manner in which he had protected\r\nthe important interests confided to his care, and for his defence of the\r\nhonour of the flag of the United States, and the rights and dignity of\r\nAmerican citizenship.\r\n\r\nAll this was endorsed in the most emphatic manner by the leading\r\nstatesmen and naval and military commanders of America, including\r\nSecretary of State James G. Blaine, Rear Admiral Evans, Admiral Brown,\r\nRear-Admiral McCann, and numerous other officers of the army and navy.\r\n\r\nThe strongest eulogies of Mr. Egan's conduct of the Chilian legation\r\nwere written by the ex-President of the United States, Theodore\r\nRoosevelt, who, in 1892, gave a dinner at his home in Washington, D.C.,\r\nin his honour. In a public letter Mr. Roosevelt said, \"Minister Egan has\r\nacted as an American representative in a way that proves that he\r\ndeserves well of all Americans, and I earnestly hope that his career in\r\nour diplomatic service may be long, and that in it he may rise to the\r\nhighest positions.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I started a new series of my \"Irish Library\" in January, 1902, I\r\nreceived words of encouragement from John Redmond, from Michael Davitt,\r\nand from other distinguished Irishmen, but there was none I valued more\r\nhighly than the letter of appreciation of my works from Pat Egan. Of\r\nthese he asked me to send him a set, including my \"Irish in Britain.\"\r\n\r\nIn a letter he sent me in the May following, I could see the yearning of\r\nthe exile for news from the \"old sod\" when he said \"Write me a line to\r\nsay how you are, and how goes the good old cause. I often think with\r\nmuch interest of the last time I had the pleasure of seeing you in\r\nLiverpool.\"\r\n\r\nI have made my references to Patrick Egan somewhat lengthy, perhaps, but\r\nit is because in no work that I have ever seen has an adequate tribute\r\nbeen paid to his services to Ireland. Unlike other men who are better\r\nknown, he was little seen and not much heard of in the Land League\r\nmovement, but his influence in shaping the movement was second only to\r\nthat of Davitt. He was eminently the practical patriot, and his motto\r\nwas \"deeds not words.\" If she had had in the past many men like Egan,\r\nIreland would be both free and prosperous to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ELECTION OF 1885--PARNELL A CANDIDATE FOR EXCHANGE\r\nDIVISION--RETIRES IN FAVOUR OF O'SHEA--T.P. O'CONNOR ELECTED FOR\r\nSCOTLAND DIVISION OF LIVERPOOL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Franchise and Re-Distribution Acts of 1884 and 1885, besides\r\nplacing, for the first time, the Parliamentary representation in the\r\nhands of the great bulk of the people of Ireland, added greatly to our\r\npolitical power in England, Scotland and Wales. Many thousands of Irish\r\nhouseholders obtained votes where formerly, under the restricted\r\nfranchise, such a thing as an Irish county voter was extremely rare.\r\n\r\nAt the General Election of 1885, Mr. Parnell made Liverpool his\r\nheadquarters. The Re-Distribution Act had given Liverpool nine\r\nParliamentary Divisions, in one of which (Scotland Division) we had\r\nsufficient votes to return a Nationalist. As Mr. T.P. O'Connor was the\r\ncandidate chosen, and was, besides, the President of the organisation in\r\nGreat Britain, he, also, was on the spot.\r\n\r\nA central committee room was engaged in the North-Western Hotel, where\r\nMr. Parnell and Mr. T.P. O'Connor were staying. I was detailed to act as\r\nsecretary to them, and, as the electoral campaign all over the country\r\nwas directed from this centre, I was kept busy from early morning until\r\nlate in the night answering the letters which poured in from all parts\r\nof the country. Mr. T.P. O'Connor having recently been married, Mrs.\r\nO'Connor also was staying in the North-Western. She presided at our\r\nluncheon every day, and made a charming hostess.\r\n\r\nI have some pleasant remembrances of those days in Liverpool, when I was\r\nassisting Mr. Parnell in carrying on the electoral campaign. One day, as\r\nwe stood together looking out of the window across Lime Street, he\r\npointed to the hotel on the opposite side of the street, reminding me\r\nthat it was there we first met. This was when he came amongst us, a\r\npromising young recruit, under the wing of Isaac Butt. I remembered it\r\nwell, and the number of questions he asked me about the condition of our\r\npeople, social and political, in this country, for he knew that I had\r\nhad opportunities of acquiring a closer knowledge of them than most\r\npeople. He often afterwards sought from me such information. To me, from\r\nfirst to last, he was always most open and friendly, and I never found\r\nhim so \"stand-off\" and unapproachable as was the very common opinion\r\nabout him.\r\n\r\nIn the Exchange Division of Liverpool, a Mr. Stephens, the official\r\nLiberal candidate, had, for some reason, been replaced by Captain\r\nO'Shea, who got the full support of the Liberal party. Following\r\ninstructions from headquarters, the Irish Nationalists had denounced the\r\ncandidate of the Liberals, who, when recently in power, had coerced\r\nIreland, and O'Shea was condemned more unmercifully than any of them, as\r\nbeing, besides, a renegade Irishman.\r\n\r\nWhen Parnell himself came on the scene as a candidate for Exchange\r\nDivision, Captain O'Shea was denounced more fiercely than ever. Mr.\r\nParnell, however, withdrew on the nomination day, and at a great meeting\r\non the same night, much to the astonishment of all, asked, in a very\r\nhalting and hesitating manner, that O'Shea's candidature should be\r\nsupported. So great was his power and prestige at the time that,\r\nwhatever apprehension might be felt, no attempt was made to question his\r\naction.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the election I went to the North-Western. Mr. O'Connor\r\nwas somewhat late in getting to work. Parnell, noticing, I suppose, that\r\nI seemed uneasy about something, asked, \"What's amiss with you, Denvir?\"\r\n\"We would like to see Mr. O'Connor on the ground in Scotland Division,\"\r\nI said. He shook his head: \"Ah, that's the way with him since he got\r\nmarried.\" I smiled and observed \"We'll be losing you that way some\r\ntime.\" \"No,\" he replied, as I thought somewhat sadly, \"I lost my chance\r\nlong ago.\"\r\n\r\nAll that day Parnell worked with desperate energy for O'Shea. He even\r\ntook some of our men from Scotland Division to help in Exchange. I\r\nexpostulated with him, saying, \"You'll be losing T.P.'s election for\r\nus.\" As a matter of fact, we won Scotland Division by 1,350 votes.\r\n\r\nIn point of fact, if O'Shea had got the whole Irish vote he would have\r\nwon, but Mr. Parnell's vehement efforts could kindle no enthusiasm among\r\nthe Irish electors, and there was a small but determined section\r\nwhich--while unwilling to let any public evidence of disagreement with\r\nMr. Parnell appear--absolutely refused to support O'Shea. This lost him\r\nthe seat.\r\n\r\nThere was great jubilation in the League Hall that night at the winning\r\nof a seat in England by an Irish Home Ruler, elected _as such_, Mr. T.P.\r\nO'Connor having been returned that day for the Scotland Division of\r\nLiverpool.\r\n\r\nSince that time there have been several Home Rulers, Irish by birth or\r\ndescent, returned to Parliament for English constituencies. These belong\r\nto the Labour Party.\r\n\r\nBesides T.P. O'Connor, Liverpool has provided for Parliament quite a\r\nnumber of men who at one time or another have represented or still\r\nrepresent Irish constituencies. These are Dr. Commins, Daniel Crilly,\r\nLawrence Connolly, Michael Conway, Joseph Nolan, Patrick O'Brien,\r\nWilliam O'Malley, James Lysaght Finigan, and Garrett Byrne.\r\n\r\nAt the League Hall demonstration on the night of the election, Mr.\r\nParnell appeared to have caught the high spirit and enthusiasm of his\r\naudience, and in a more powerful address than I had ever before heard\r\nfrom him, he said:--\r\n\r\n     Ireland has been knocking at the English door long enough with kid\r\n     gloves. I tell the English people to beware, and be wise in time.\r\n     Ireland will soon throw off the kid gloves, and she will knock with\r\n     a mailed hand.\r\n\r\nIn this General Election, the Irish vote of Great Britain, in\r\naccordance with the League manifesto, generally went for the Tories, who\r\ncame into office, but with a majority so small that they were turned out\r\nat the opening of the Session of 1886, and Mr. Gladstone again came into\r\npower. Seeing that 85 out of the 103 Irish members of Parliament had\r\nbeen returned pledged to National self-government, he came to the\r\nconclusion to drop coercion, and no longer to attempt to rule the\r\ncountry against the wishes of the people. He, therefore, introduced his\r\nHome Rule Bill on the 8th of April, 1886, but, failing to carry the\r\nwhole of his party with him, he was defeated on the second reading by 30\r\nvotes. His defeat at the polls at the General Election which followed\r\nseemed even more crushing than his defeat in Parliament, for, of the\r\nmembers elected, there was a majority against him of 118.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone, looking more closely into the figures of the General\r\nElection, was not disheartened, and as the British public became\r\neducated on the Irish question, bye-election after bye-election proved\r\ntriumphantly the truth of his famous saying that the \"Flowing Tide\" was\r\ncarrying the cause of Home Rule on to victory.\r\n\r\nNor were _we_ disheartened, for, counting up the whole of about two and\r\na half millions of votes given, we found that the Unionists, as the\r\nTories and Dissentient Liberals called themselves, had a majority of\r\nless than 80,000 votes at the polls. During this time I had become\r\ngeneral organiser of the recognised Irish political organisation of\r\nGreat Britain, and upon me chiefly devolved the duty of directing the\r\nwork of registration of our Irish voters. A close study of the local\r\nconditions in the various constituencies showed that the mere bringing\r\nup of the neglected Irish vote to something approaching its proper\r\nstrength would _alone_ be sufficient to effect the necessary gain. We\r\nthrew ourselves into the task--and we succeeded.\r\n\r\nI shall always remember with pride my share in increasing and organising\r\nthe Irish vote throughout Great Britain, and its result in bringing Mr.\r\nGladstone back to power, and enabling him to carry the Home Rule Bill\r\nthrough the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nIt was my duty to visit every part of Great Britain to see that the\r\nvarious districts and branches were kept in a high state of efficiency,\r\nand at the end of that period of hard and unremitting work from 1886 to\r\n1892 I was able to show our Executive from the books and figures in our\r\npossession that we had accomplished our aim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nGLADSTONE'S \"FLOWING TIDE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI was present at most of the bye-elections that led up to Gladstone's\r\ngreat victory at the General Election of 1892.\r\n\r\nIn this way I was brought to many places interesting to us as Catholics\r\nas well as Irishmen.\r\n\r\nNo spot in Great Britain is more sacred to us than Iona, an island off\r\nthe West coast of Scotland, which our great typical Irish saint,\r\nColumba, made his home and centre when bringing the light of faith to\r\nthose regions. It will, therefore, be one of the memories of my life\r\nmost dear to me that I had the blessing of taking part in the famous\r\nPilgrimage to Iona on June 13th, 1888. The town of Oban, on the mainland\r\nof Scotland, is generally made the point of departure for Iona, which is\r\nnot far off.\r\n\r\nOban is one of the five Ayr burghs which, combined, send a member to\r\nParliament, and it was singular that, at this time, there was a\r\nbye-election going on. As creed and country have always gone together\r\nwith me, I did not think it at all inappropriate that I should do a\r\nlittle work for Irish self-government while on this Pilgrimage. On the\r\ncontrary. Was not St. Columba himself a champion of Home Rule, for was\r\nit not through his eloquent advocacy of their cause before the great\r\nIrish National Assembly that the Scots of Alba, as distinguished from\r\nthe Scots of Erin, obtained the right of self-government?\r\n\r\nOne of the best numbers of my Irish Library was the \"Life of St.\r\nColumbkille,\" written for me by Michael O'Mahony, one of a band of young\r\nIrishmen, members of the Irish Literary Institute of Liverpool, who did\r\nsplendid service for the Cause in that city. Michael was, of these,\r\nperhaps the one possessing the most characteristic Irish gifts. He has\r\nwritten some admirable stories of Irish life, and is a poet, although he\r\nhas not written as much as I would like to see from his pen.\r\n\r\nThere are no Irish residents in Iona itself, but I found a few in Oban,\r\non whom I called to secure their votes for Home Rule.\r\n\r\nTo hear Mass on the spot made sacred by the feet of our great Irish\r\nsaint, in the building, then a ruin, erected by his successors to\r\nreplace that which he himself had raised here as a centre of his great\r\nmissionary labours, was an experience to treasure until one's latest\r\nday. What made the celebration the more memorable was the sermon in\r\nGaelic by Bishop MacDonald of Argyll and the Isles. I had the pleasure,\r\nafter Mass, of having dinner with him, and some most interesting\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\nI told him I had read with great interest a pastoral of his, issued some\r\nfive years before, in which he said that an interesting peculiarity of\r\nhis diocese, in respect of which it stood almost alone in the country,\r\nwas that its Catholicity was almost exclusively represented by districts\r\nwhich had always clung to the faith, places where in the Penal days no\r\npriest dared show himself in public, but visited the Catholic centres in\r\nturn as a layman by night and gathered the children together to instruct\r\nthem as far as he was able. This was, he said, of extraordinary interest\r\non a day like that, when we were specially honouring the memory of the\r\ngreat saint who had sown the seeds which had continued to bear fruit\r\nthrough so many centuries. We also spoke of the singular fact that he\r\nhad that day preached on the spot on which St. Columba himself had\r\nstood, and in the same language that he spoke, a language which had been\r\nin existence long before the present English tongue was spoken. As\r\nshowing that the Scottish and Irish Gaelic were practically the same, as\r\ndistinguished from the Celtic tongue spoken by the Welsh and Bretons,\r\nBishop MacDonald told me he could read quite easily a book printed in\r\nthe Irish characters.\r\n\r\nAs a bye-election brought me to the sacred scene of the labours of our\r\ngreat Irish saint, Columba, so did another bye-election bring me to the\r\nspot where a martyr for Ireland suffered in 1798--Father O'Coigly. There\r\nwas a bye-election at Maidstone, where the martyr priest had been tried\r\nfor treason, and near it is Pennenden Heath, where he was executed, so\r\nthat both places will for ever be held sacred by patriotic Irishmen.\r\nBesides securing a pledge for Home Rule from one of the candidates, and\r\norganising the small Irish vote in his favour, I took the opportunity of\r\ninaugurating a movement for the erection of a memorial to Father\r\nO'Coigly. With the co-operation of the London branches of the United\r\nIrish League the movement was brought to a successful issue. On two\r\nsucceeding years there were Pilgrimages to the spot where Father\r\nO'Coigly was executed, at which Mr. James Francis Xavier O'Brien, who\r\nhimself had been sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered, was the\r\nchief speaker one year, and Mr. John Murphy, M.P., on the other.\r\n\r\nBesides this, chiefly through the exertions of Mr. John Brady, District\r\nOrganiser, funds were raised, and there have been erected in the\r\nCatholic Church at Maidstone a Celtic Cross and three beautiful\r\nstained-glass windows, of Irish manufacture, to commemorate the\r\nmartyrdom of Father O'Coigly.\r\n\r\nA gratifying thing in connection with our Pilgrimage was, I reminded\r\nthose I addressed on Pennenden Heath, that a man pledged to support\r\nself-government for Ireland, the Cause for which Father O'Coigly had\r\nsuffered, had been elected to Parliament for Maidstone.\r\n\r\nIn the bye-elections about this time, we often got the most satisfactory\r\nresults from places where the Irish vote was but small. I have before my\r\nmind the Carnarvon Boroughs bye election of 1890. Here the seat had been\r\nheld by a Tory, and the Irish vote in the five towns, all told, was not\r\nmuch more than 50. I was sent to the constituency by our Executive to\r\nuse every exertion to get our people to poll for David Lloyd-George, a\r\nthorough-going Home Ruler, at that time an unknown man, though he has\r\nsince risen to the first political and ministerial rank. It was then I\r\nmade his acquaintance, and time has only increased the friendly feeling\r\nbetween us.\r\n\r\nOur meeting happened rather curiously. While on my round I came across\r\nan unpretentious-looking young man who, I discovered, was also working\r\non the same side. We had chatted together for some time when I happened\r\nto make some reference to the candidate. \"Oh,\" he said, with a laugh, \"I\r\nam the candidate.\" It was Mr. Lloyd-George. We worked together with all\r\nthe more ardour being brother Celts. I frequently expressed to him my\r\nadmiration for a striking feature in their great meetings during the\r\nelection campaign. This was the singing in their native tongue of songs\r\ncalculated to rouse the enthusiasm of an emotional people like the\r\nWelsh, the climax being reached at the end of each meeting with their\r\nnoble national anthem, sung in the native tongue of course, \"Land of my\r\nFathers.\"\r\n\r\nSince that time it is gratifying to realize the great progress which has\r\nbeen made in the revival of _our_ native tongue through the\r\ninstrumentality of the Gaelic League. The success of our friends in this\r\ndirection ought to be an encouragement to us. The old Cymric tongue is\r\nalmost universal throughout Wales, side by side with the English, so\r\nthat it is not all visionary to think that a day may come when ours,\r\ntoo, may become a bi-lingual people.\r\n\r\nMr. Edmund Vesey Knox, an Ulster Protestant Home Ruler, who was then a\r\nmember of the Irish Parliamentary Party, came to assist in the return of\r\nMr. Lloyd-George. At one of their great gatherings he told his audience\r\nhow much he was impressed by the enthusiasm created by their native\r\nmusic and song. This reminded him, he said, that one of their great\r\nIrish poets, Thomas Davis, was partially of Welsh descent, which no\r\ndoubt inspired one of his noblest songs \"Cymric Rule and Cymric Rulers,\"\r\nwritten to their soul-stirring Welsh air, \"The March of the Men of\r\nHarlech.\" After Mr. Knox, more singing, and then came a delightful\r\naddress from a distinguished Irish lady, Mrs. Bryant, who did splendid\r\nservice at many of these bye elections. Doctor Sophie Bryant, to give\r\nher full title, is a lady of great learning and eloquence, and not only\r\na thorough Nationalist in sentiment, but an energetic worker in the\r\nCause. A literary lady colleague thus sums up her chief qualities: \"She\r\nis more learned than any man I know; more tender than any woman I have\r\never met.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Lloyd-George was elected by the bare majority of 18 votes, so that\r\nwithout the small Irish vote in the Carnarvon Boroughs he could not have\r\nbeen returned at his first election for the constituency. Nor did he\r\nforget the fact. On one occasion we were speaking together in the lobby\r\nof the House of Commons when a friend of his came up. \"This,\" said Mr.\r\nLloyd-George, slapping me on the shoulder, \"is the man who brought me\r\nhere.\" In a sense it was true, so that I might claim to have assisted in\r\nmaking a British Chancellor of the Exchequer.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of the series of bye-elections which Mr. Gladstone\r\ndescribed as the \"Flowing Tide\" which had set in for Home Rule. I\r\nremember with special pleasure one of these--that for the Rossendale\r\nDivision of Lancashire. It was a sample of all the other bye-elections\r\nin 1892. The registration had been well done, and we knew to a man the\r\nstrength of the Irish vote. We had 438 on the Register. This was no mere\r\nestimate, and we could give the figures at the time with equal accuracy\r\nfor most places where we had an Irish population. Every voter of ours\r\nliving in Rossendale had been visited. If he had removed from place to\r\nplace inside the district it was noted. If he had gone out of the\r\ndistrict he was communicated with, if possible through the medium of the\r\nbranch of his new location. We knew where to find them all, and it was\r\nastonishing from what distant places men turned up to vote on the\r\nelection day, through the agency of the local branches of the places to\r\nwhich the voters had gone.\r\n\r\nIn this Rossendale election I had two of the most capable lieutenants a\r\nman need wish to have, Patrick Murphy and Daniel Boyle, both then\r\norganisers of our League. Dan Boyle (now Alderman Boyle, M.P.) took the\r\nBacup end of the Division; Pat Murphy took Rawtenstall; and I made my\r\nheadquarters at Haslingden, for I had a _grah_ for the place, on\r\naccount of its connection with my old friend, Michael Davitt.\r\n\r\nThere can be no better test of a man's sterling qualities than the\r\nopinions held of him by the friends of his youth. Several times I had\r\nhad occasion to visit Haslingden, the little factory town in North-East\r\nLancashire, where Martin Davitt, the father of Michael, and his family\r\nlived when they came to this country after being evicted from their home\r\nin Mayo. Here I met Mr. Cockcroft, the bookseller, who gave Michael\r\nemployment after he had lost his arm in the factory, and he and his\r\nfamily bore the Irish lad in kindly remembrance. But it was among his\r\nown people--those who had been the companions and friends of his\r\nyouth--that I found the greatest admiration for \"Mick,\" as they\r\nfamiliarly called him. I need scarcely say that they watched with pride\r\nthe noble career of one who had grown to manhood in their midst.\r\n\r\nI was able to turn that feeling to good account on the occasion of this\r\nRossendale election. I asked the Liberal candidate, Mr. Maden, a young\r\nand wealthy cotton spinner of Rossendale, who had given us satisfactory\r\npledges on Home Rule, to invite Michael Davitt's assistance. He did so.\r\nI backed up the request by a personal appeal, which he never refused if\r\nit lay in his power to do what I wished. He came, and words fail to\r\ndescribe his loving and enthusiastic reception by his own people.\r\n\r\nI have alluded to the perfect way in which the Irish Vote had been\r\norganised. Michael Davitt came into our committee room one day, and it\r\nwas with intense pride he turned over the leaves of our books to show\r\nMr. Maden, the candidate, how well we were prepared to poll every Irish\r\nvote on the election day. Davitt was a tower of strength to us in this\r\nelection, not only amongst our own people, but amongst the English\r\nfactory operatives, who form the majority in Rossendale. As in other\r\nbye-elections which had preceded it, we won the Division by a handsome\r\nmajority.\r\n\r\nI was at once amused and amazed some time ago to hear of a so-called\r\nbiography of Davitt, the keynote of which was a suggestion that he was,\r\nfirst and foremost, an \"Anti-Clerical.\" The idea is an absurd one. He\r\nwas an intense lover of right, and one who scorned to be an opportunist.\r\nConsequently, he never hesitated to speak out, no matter who opposed\r\nhim, priest or layman. But none knew better than he that there have been\r\ntimes when the priests were the only friends the Irish peasantry had;\r\nand no one knew better than he that the influence they have had they\r\nhave, on the whole, used wisely. If individual clerics have gone out of\r\ntheir proper sphere of influence it is certain they would have found\r\nDavitt in opposition to them where he thought them wrong. I have been\r\nplaced in the same unpleasant position myself, but I too have always\r\ncarefully distinguished between the individual priest who needed\r\nremonstrance, and his wiser colleague; and also between the legitimate\r\nuse of a priest's influence and its abuse. So that to classify Davitt as\r\nan \"Anti-cleric\" deserves a strong protest from one who loved him as\r\nwell and as long as I did.\r\n\r\nAs I have said, when I asked him to come to Rossendale to help to\r\nfurther the cause of self-government for Ireland, he never refused a\r\nrequest of mine if it lay in his power to grant it, and, in this way, he\r\nwrote for me one of the books of my \"Irish Library\"--\"Ireland's Appeal\r\nto America.\"\r\n\r\nMichael has gone to his reward, and there are two things I shall always\r\ncherish as mementoes of him. One is a bunch of shamrocks sent to me,\r\nwith the message:\r\n\r\n                          \"With Michael Davitt's compliments,\r\n                           \"Richmond Prison, Patrickstide, 1883\"\r\n\r\nThe other is his last letter to me, written not long before his death.\r\nIt was dated \"St. Justin's, Dalkey, Co. Dublin, 7th March, 1906.\" In\r\nthis he said: \"I hope you are in good health and not growing too old. I\r\nshall be 60! on the 25th inst.!!!\" Was this a premonition that his end\r\nwas near? He died on May 31st, within three months of the time he wrote\r\nthe letter.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of the necessity for our organisation doing registration\r\nwork at least as effectually as the Liberals and Tories do. It is not\r\nalways men of the highest intellectual attainments who make the best\r\nregistration agents. This fact came home to me very forcibly when\r\nreading a biography of Thomas Davis. It was stated that in the Revision\r\nCourt he was not able to hold his own against the Tory agent. It is just\r\nwhat I would have imagined, considering the sensitive nature of Davis.\r\nA man with a face of brass, who _might_ be an able man, but who, on the\r\nother hand, might be some low ignorant fellow, might easily do better\r\nthan Thomas Davis with his fine intellect and varied learning.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, I have known men of the highest attainments who have\r\nmade excellent agents, such a man as John Renwick Seager, who has for\r\nmany years been connected with the London Liberal organisation. Just\r\nsuch another we have in our own ranks in Daniel Crilly who, before he\r\nbecame a journalist or entered Parliament, was a very successful agent\r\nin the Liverpool Courts.\r\n\r\nOne of the most efficient and conscientious of registration and\r\nelectioneering agents I ever met was John Mogan, of Liverpool. Besides\r\nthe annual registration work he was engaged on our side in nearly every\r\nelection of importance in Liverpool for over 30 years. He was so\r\nengrossed in his work that, during an election he would, if required,\r\nsit up several nights in succession to have his work properly done;\r\nindeed, I was often tempted to think that John never considered any\r\nelection complete without at least _one_ \"all night sitting.\"\r\n\r\nWe believed in fighting the enemy with his own weapons. On election days\r\nin Liverpool there were shipowners who made it a practice of getting\r\ntheir vessels coaled in the river. As, unlike the Liffey at Dublin or\r\nthe Thames at London, the Mersey at Liverpool is over a mile wide, and\r\nas most of the coal heavers were Irishmen, this move of the shipowners\r\nwas to keep our men from voting. We were successful, to some extent, in\r\ncounteracting this, for owing to the patriotism of a sterling Irishman,\r\nJohn Prendiville, the steam tugs which he owned were often used, on the\r\nday of an election, to take our men ashore.\r\n\r\nSometimes the Revision Courts gave us the opportunity of teaching a\r\nlittle Irish history. In South Wales most of our people hail from\r\nMunster. In one of the Courts there was the case of Owen O'Donovan being\r\nobjected to, on the ground that he had left the qualifying property, and\r\nthat _Eugene_ O'Donovan was now the occupier. I explained to the\r\nBarrister that in the South of Ireland the names of Owen and Eugene were\r\noften applied to the same man, Eugene being the Latinized form of Owen.\r\nI gave as an illustration our national hero, Owen Roe O'Neill, who, in\r\nletters written to him in Latin, was styled Eugenius Rufus. A Welsh\r\nofficial in Court suggested that O'Donovan was anxious to become a\r\nWelshman by calling himself Owen. I replied that the name Owen was just\r\nas Irish as it was Welsh, coming no doubt from the same Celtic stock,\r\nand that, as a matter of fact, our man preferred being on the Register\r\nas Owen. The Barrister, being satisfied that both names applied to the\r\nsame man, allowed the vote, and our voter would appear on the Register\r\nas Owen O'Donovan.\r\n\r\nIn looking up our people to have them put upon the Register, or in\r\nconnection with an election, our canvassers are often able to form a\r\ngood judgment of the creed, or nationality, or politics of the people\r\nof the house they are calling at by the pictures on the walls. If they\r\nsee a picture of St. Patrick, or the Pope, or Robert Emmet, they assume\r\nthey are in an Irish house of the right sort. One of my own apprentices,\r\nwhen I was in business, came across a bewildering complication on one\r\noccasion, for on one side of the room was the Pope, which seemed all\r\nright, but facing him was a gorgeous picture of King William crossing\r\nthe Boyne. It was the woman of the house he saw, a good, decent\r\nIrishwoman and a Catholic, who explained the apparent inconsistency. Her\r\nhusband was an Orangeman, \"as good a man as ever broke bread\" all the\r\nyear round, till it came near the twelfth of July, when the Orange fever\r\nbegan to come on. (Our people at home in the County Down, as my father\r\nused to tell us, often found it so with otherwise decent Protestant\r\nneighbours.) He would come home from a lodge meeting some night, a\r\nlittle the worse for drink, and smash the Pope to smithereens. The wife\r\nwas a sensible body, and knew it was no use interfering while the fit\r\nwas on him. When she knew it had safely passed away, she would take King\r\nWilliam to the pawnshop round the corner and get as much on him as would\r\nbuy a new Pope. He was too fond of his wife, \"Papish\" and all as she\r\nwas, to make any fuss about it, and would just go and redeem his idol,\r\nand set him up again, facing the Pope, for another twelve months at all\r\nevents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nTHE \"TIMES\" FORGERIES COMMISSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the \"Times\" on the 18th of April, 1887 published what purported to\r\nbe the _fac simile_ of a letter from Mr. Parnell, and suggested that it\r\nwas written to Mr. Patrick Egan in justification of the Phoenix Park\r\nassassinations, I at once, like many others, guessed who the forger must\r\nbe. I had from time to time come into contact with Pigott, and I was\r\nsatisfied that he was the one man capable of such a production.\r\n\r\nWhen the company was formed in 1875 for the starting of a newspaper in\r\nconnection with the Home Rule Confederation of Great Britain, there was\r\nan idea of buying Pigott's papers, \"The Irishman,\" \"Flag of Ireland,\"\r\nand \"Shamrock,\" which always seemed to be in the market, whether to the\r\nGovernment or the Nationalists after events showed to be a matter of\r\nperfect indifference to him. Mr. John Barry and I were sent over to\r\nDublin to treat with him. Mr. Barry went over the books and I went over\r\nthe plant. What he wanted seemed reasonable enough, we thought.\r\n\r\nThe Directors of our Company did not, however, close with Pigott, but\r\nconcluded to start a paper of their own, \"The United Irishman,\" the\r\nproduction and direction of which, as I have stated, they placed in my\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nDuring these years I had many opportunities of getting a knowledge of\r\nPigott's true character. From time to time money had been subscribed\r\nthrough Pigott's papers for various national funds. Michael Davitt told\r\nme that when the political prisoners were released the committee\r\nappointed to raise a fund for them, to give them a start in life,\r\napplied for what had been sent through the \"Irishman\" and \"Flag,\" that\r\nthe whole of the funds subscribed through the various channels might be\r\npublicly presented to the men. There was considerable difficulty in\r\ngetting this money from Pigott, but ultimately it was squeezed out of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAn employe of the \"Irishman,\" David Murphy, was shot--he survived his\r\nwound--in a mysterious manner. This was ascribed, and from all we know\r\nof the man, correctly, to Pigott, who, it was thought, fearing that\r\nMurphy might know too much about the sums coming into his hands and the\r\nsources whence they came, had tried to get him put out of the way. There\r\nwas a still more serious aspect of this attempted assassination. The\r\nrevelations of the \"Times\" Forgeries Commission afterwards proved that\r\nall this time Pigott was giving information to the police and getting\r\npaid for it. To my own personal knowledge David Murphy held an important\r\nposition in the advanced organisation, for I once brought a young friend\r\nof mine, a printer, a sterling Irishman I had known from his early\r\nboyhood in Liverpool, from Wexford, where he was at the time employed,\r\nspecially to introduce him to Murphy.\r\n\r\nFrom the information given to the police by Pigott, it would soon be\r\nfound there was some leakage, which would, no doubt, be traced to the\r\n\"Irishman\" office. It would, of course, be Pigott's cue to put the blame\r\non the shoulders of Murphy, hence probably his attempted assassination.\r\n\r\nIt was not unreasonable, then, in looking round for the actual forger of\r\nthe famous _fac simile_ letter, that I and others who knew him should\r\nsingle out a man with such a bad record as Richard Pigott as the actual\r\ncriminal.\r\n\r\nThe collapse of the conspiracy against the Irish leaders, and the\r\nsuicide of the wretched Pigott on the 1st of March, 1889, are matters of\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nFor the complete way in which the conspiracy was smashed up great credit\r\nwas due to the distinguished Irish advocate, Sir Charles Russell. In his\r\nearly days I knew him well, and was often thrown into contact with him,\r\nwhen he was a young barrister practising on the Northern circuit, and\r\nmaking Liverpool his headquarters. He was a member of the Liverpool\r\nCatholic Club when I was secretary of that body. The Club, before the\r\nHome Rule organisation superseded it in Liverpool, generally supported\r\nthe Liberals in Parliamentary elections, but on one occasion there was,\r\nfrom a Catholic point of view, a very undesirable Liberal candidate,\r\nwhom it was determined not to support. Pressure had, therefore, to be\r\nput upon the Liberals to withdraw this man. They were obstinate, though\r\nthey had not the ghost of a chance without the Irish and Catholic vote,\r\nwhich formed fully half the strength they could generally count upon. On\r\nthe other hand, _we_ could not carry the seat by our own unaided vote.\r\nBut, to show the Liberals that we would not have their man under any\r\ncircumstances, it was arranged that if he were willing we should put\r\nCharles Russell forward as our candidate. As secretary it became my duty\r\nto ask him to place himself in our hands. He agreed, on the\r\nunderstanding that he was to be withdrawn if our action had the effect\r\nof forcing the Liberals to get a candidate more acceptable to us. We\r\nsucceeded, and, of course, withdrew our man.\r\n\r\nWhen we started the Home Rule organisation in Liverpool, we asked\r\nCharles Russell to be chairman of our inaugural public meeting. He had\r\nbeen contesting Dundalk as a Home Ruler, so we thought he was the very\r\nman to preside at our meeting, and gave that as our reason for asking\r\nhim. He received the deputation--my friend, Alfred Crilly and\r\nmyself--with that geniality and courtesy which were so characteristic of\r\nhim. As it happened that the three of us were County Down men, who are\r\nsomewhat clannish, we soon got talking about the people \"at home.\" He\r\nknew both our families in Ireland, and had served his time with a\r\nsolicitor of my name in Newry, Cornelius Denvir, before he had entered\r\nthe other branch of the legal profession. We also got talking of the\r\nbarony of Lecale, which he, as well as my own people, had sprung from,\r\nand how it had been the only Norman colony in Ulster; how many of the\r\ndescendants of De Courcy's followers were still there, as might be seen\r\nfrom their names--Russells, Savages, Mandevilles. Dorrians, Denvirs, and\r\nothers, whose fathers, intermarrying with the original Celtic\r\npopulation, MacCartans, Magennises, MacRorys, and so on, had become like\r\nthe Burkes, Fitzgeralds, and other Norman clans, \"More Irish than the\r\nIrish themselves.\"\r\n\r\nThis was all very well, and very interesting, but it did not get us our\r\nchairman. Charles Russell was too wary, and, perhaps, too far-seeing,\r\nwho can tell? for that. It was quite true, he said, he had contested\r\nDundalk as a Home Ruler, and, of course, he was a Home Ruler, but he\r\nadvised us to ask Dr. Commins to be our chairman, as being so much\r\nbetter known than himself. We did ask \"The Doctor,\" and, kindly and\r\ngenial as we ever found him, he at once consented.\r\n\r\nNearly forty years have passed since then, and I really believe that\r\nthese two, then comparatively young men, practically made choice of\r\ntheir respective after-careers on that occasion.\r\n\r\nDr. Commins, who, like Charles Russell, was a practising barrister on\r\nthe Northern circuit, held for some years the highest position his\r\nfellow-countrymen could give him as President of the Home Rule\r\nConfederation of Great Britain, and became a member of the Irish\r\nParliamentary Party.\r\n\r\nCharles Russell, though always a Home Ruler and sincere lover of his\r\ncountry, made a brilliant career for himself as a great lawyer and\r\nLiberal statesman. I have often wondered since, if he had become\r\nchairman of our meeting in 1872, and had then identified himself with\r\nthe Home Rule movement, if his statue would be to-day as it is in the\r\nLondon Law Courts, or if he would ever have been Lord Chief Justice of\r\nEngland and Lord Russell of Killowen? I think not.\r\n\r\nThe \"Times\" Forgeries Commission, though got up to do deadly damage to\r\nthe Irish Cause, had not, even before the final collapse of the\r\nconspiracy, had that effect, as bye-election after bye-election proved.\r\nFor instance, when the Commission appointed to deal with the \"Times\"\r\ncharges against the Irish leaders re-opened, after a short vacation at\r\nChristmas, the Govan election was going on, and, on the 19th of January,\r\n1889, the Liberal Home Ruler won the seat by a majority of over 1,000.\r\n\r\nAfter the exposure of the plot, Mr. Gladstone's \"Flowing Tide\" swept on\r\nwith increased velocity, and, wherever there was a bye-election, there\r\nwas an enormous demand for our members of Parliament. During this\r\nperiod, when the Irish vote in Great Britain was more fully organised\r\nthan it ever had been before, I attended most of these elections. It was\r\nkeenly felt, as had been proved on several occasions, that _no_ place,\r\nhowever small the number of Irish voters, should be overlooked,\r\nespecially at a time when British parties had become once more pretty\r\nevenly balanced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nDISRUPTION OF THE IRISH PARTY--HOME RULE CARRIED IN THE COMMONS--UNITY\r\nOF PARLIAMENTARY PARTY RESTORED--MR. JOHN REDMOND BECOMES LEADER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is nothing more bitter than a family quarrel.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate disruption in the Irish Parliamentary Party and the\r\nfierce quarrel that arose among the Irish people near the end of 1890,\r\nwould be to me such a painful theme that I must ask my readers to pardon\r\nme if I pass on as quickly as possible towards the happier times which\r\nfind us practically a re-united people, while the Irish Party in\r\nParliament is a solid working force under the able leadership of Mr.\r\nJohn Redmond.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the demands of the branches of the Irish organisation\r\nin Great Britain, a special Convention was called and held in\r\nNewcastle-on-Tyne on Saturday, 16th May, 1891. Delegates from all parts\r\nof Great Britain attended, and elected a new Executive in harmony with\r\nthe bulk of the League, with Mr. T.P. O'Connor, President, as before.\r\n\r\nProvision was also made for carrying on the fight for Home Rule in the\r\nconstituencies, which had been somewhat relaxed by the unhappy split in\r\nour ranks. This was imperative, in view of the necessity for assisting\r\nto return to Parliament a sufficient majority to enable Mr. Gladstone to\r\ncarry his Home Rule Bill through the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nThe result of the General Election of 1892 was the return to power of\r\nMr. Gladstone. His majority was the best proof to friend and foe of the\r\nvalue of the work done by our organisation during the previous years in\r\nadding to the Irish vote in Great Britain. It also showed we had the\r\npower and the influence in the constituencies we had claimed. Indeed,\r\nthe books in the offices of the League could show, by the figures for\r\nevery constituency, that without the Irish vote Mr. Gladstone would have\r\nhad no majority at all.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to consider the terrible crisis we were passing through,\r\nthe result was magnificent.\r\n\r\nAlthough, as we all expected, Mr. Gladstone's Home Rule Bill was thrown\r\nout by the House of Lords, the fact that a Bill conferring\r\nself-government on Ireland had been passed in the Commons was recognised\r\nas a step towards that end which could never be receded from, and that\r\nit was but a question of time when the Home Rule Cause would be won.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the event proved that our grievance was no longer against the\r\nEnglish democracy, but against the class which misgoverned us, just as\r\nit, to a lesser extent, misgoverned them.\r\n\r\nMost of us have, no doubt, taken part in a family gathering on some\r\njoyous occasion when the mother realizes that _all_ her children are\r\nnot around her, and is overcome with sadness. So it was with us. Well\r\nmight mother Ireland ask why were not _all_ her children in the one\r\nfold, to be one with her and with each other in the hour of rejoicing,\r\nas they had been loyally with her in all her sorrows? Why was the bitter\r\nfeud over the leadership of the Irish Party so long kept up? Why was the\r\nhappy reconciliation so long delayed?\r\n\r\nWhile the majority, it is true, were arrayed on one side, the fact\r\nremained that on the other side there were men of undoubted patriotism\r\nand great ability, not only members of Parliament such as John and\r\nWilliam Redmond or Timothy Harrington, but some of our best men all over\r\nthe country, who had done splendid service for the Cause, and were\r\neither in fierce antagonism or holding aloof.\r\n\r\nIt was during this sad time that I met that distinguished orator, Thomas\r\nSexton, to whom John Barry was good enough to introduce me. Sexton came\r\nspecially from Ireland on this occasion in the interests of peace.\r\nActuated by the same motive was Patrick James Foley, another member of\r\nthe Party and of the Executive of the League, who, while holding\r\nstrongly to his own conscientious opinions, was always most courteous to\r\nthose differing from him.\r\n\r\nI attended the great Irish Race Convention, held in the Leinster Hall,\r\nDublin, on the first three days of September, 1896. The Most Reverend\r\nPatrick O'Donnell, Bishop of Raphoe, a noble representative of old\r\nTyrconnell, and a tower of strength to our Cause, presided, and it was,\r\nundoubtedly, one of the most representative gatherings of the Irish race\r\nfrom all parts of the world ever held.\r\n\r\nTwo admirable resolutions were passed with great enthusiasm and perfect\r\nunanimity, and there is no doubt but that this Convention was the first\r\ngreat step towards the reunion of the Irish Parliamentary Party, which\r\nhas been since so happily effected.\r\n\r\nIt was more than three years after the Race Convention before the\r\nlong-desired re-union of the Irish Party and the Irish people all over\r\nthe world was accomplished at a Conference of members of Parliament of\r\nboth parties held in Committee Room 15 of the House of Commons, on\r\nTuesday, January 30th, 1900.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nTHE GAELIC REVIVAL--THOMAS DAVIS--CHARLES GAVAN DUFFY--ANGLO-IRISH\r\nLITERATURE--THE IRISH DRAMA--DRAMATISTS AND ACTORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne effect of the disturbance in political work caused by the split\r\nseemed to be the impetus given to existing movements which, so far as\r\npolitics were concerned, were neutral ground. Chief amongst these was\r\nthe Gaelic League, which from its foundation advanced by leaps and\r\nbounds and brought to the front many fine characters.\r\n\r\nFrancis Fahy was one of the first Presidents of the Gaelic League of\r\nLondon, and there is no doubt but the Irish language movement in the\r\nmetropolis owes much to his influence and indefatigable exertions.\r\n\r\nI first made his acquaintance over twenty-five years ago, when he was\r\ndoing such splendid Irish propagandism in the Southwark Irish Literary\r\nClub, of which, although he had able and enthusiastic helpers, he was\r\nthe life and soul. He has written many songs and poems, which have been\r\ncollected and published. What is, perhaps, one of the raciest and most\r\nadmired of his songs, \"The Quid Plaid Shawl,\" first appeared in the\r\n\"Nationalist\" for February 7th, 1885, a weekly periodical which I was\r\npublishing at the time. Several stirring songs of great merit by other\r\nmembers of the society also appeared in its pages. Indeed, the members\r\ncame to look upon the \"Nationalist\" as their own special organ, and ably\r\nwritten and animated accounts of their proceedings appeared regularly in\r\nits columns. I also published a song book for them, compiled by Francis\r\nFahy, chiefly for the use of their younger members.\r\n\r\nAn active Gaelic Leaguer, who did much for the success of the movement\r\nin London, was William Patrick Ryan. He wrote a \"Life of Thomas Davis\"\r\nfor \"Denvir's Monthly,\" a sort of revival of my \"Irish Library.\" This\r\nbook was very favourably received by the press. The \"Liverpool Daily\r\nPost\" gave it more than a column of admirable criticism, evidently from\r\nthe pen of the editor himself, Sir Edward Russell. In it was the\r\nfollowing kindly reference to myself: \"Our present pleasing duty is to\r\nrecognise the labours of Mr. Denvir--efforts in such a cause are always\r\ntouchingly beautiful--as an inculcator of national sentiment; to\r\nillustrate the genuine literary interest and value of the first booklet\r\nof his new library; and to wish the library a long and useful, and in\r\nevery way successful vogue.\"\r\n\r\nAnother active man in the language movement in London, whose\r\nacquaintance I was glad to renew when I first came to the metropolis, is\r\nDoctor Mark Ryan.\r\n\r\nIt is nearly forty years since we first knew each other in connection\r\nwith another organisation. He then lived in a North Lancashire town,\r\nand was studying medicine, not being at that time a fully qualified\r\ndoctor. If I remember rightly, our interview had no connexion with the\r\nhealing art, indeed quite the contrary, for besides qualifying for the\r\nmedical profession, he was graduating in the same school as Rickard\r\nBurke, Arthur Forrester, and Michael Davitt, but, like myself, was more\r\nfortunate than Burke and Davitt, inasmuch as he escaped their fate of\r\nbeing sent into penal servitude. Although Mark Ryan was for a long time\r\nresident in Lancashire, he there lost nothing, nor has he since, of the\r\nfluent Gaelic speech of his native Galway, for I heard him quite\r\nrecently delivering an eloquent speech in Irish at a gathering of the\r\nGaelic League.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Dr. Mark Ryan reminds me of how often I have noticed in my\r\ntravels through Great Britain, what a number of Irish doctors there are,\r\nand also that they are almost invariably patriotic. They are of great\r\nservice to the cause, for it frequently happens that, in some districts,\r\nthey are almost the only men of culture, and are not generally slow to\r\ntake the lead among their humbler fellow-countrymen.\r\n\r\nOne of the finest Irish scholars in the Gaelic League was Mr. Thomas\r\nFlannery. He, too, was a valued contributor to my \"Monthly Irish\r\nLibrary,\" two of the best books in the series, \"Dr. John O'Donovan,\" and\r\n\"Archbishop MacHale,\" being from his pen. In fact, he and Timothy\r\nMacSweeny I might almost look upon as having been the Gaelic editors of\r\nthe \"Monthly.\"\r\n\r\nI once, when in business in Liverpool, printed a Scottish Gaelic\r\nPrayer-Book for Father Campbell, one of the Jesuit priests of that city,\r\nfor use among the Catholic congregations in the highlands and islands of\r\nScotland. John Rogers, like Timothy MacSweeny, a ripe Irish scholar,\r\ncalled on me while it was in progress, and was delighted to know that\r\nsuch a book was being issued. To Mr. MacSweeny I also sent a copy, and\r\nthey both could read the Scottish Gaelic easily, showing, of course, how\r\nclosely the Irish and Scottish Gaels were, with the Manx, united in one\r\nbranch of the Celtic race, as distinguished from the Bretons and Welsh.\r\n\r\nI have always had an intense admiration for the poetry of \"Young\r\nIreland.\" I used to call it Irish literature until I found myself\r\ncorrected, very properly, by my Gaelic League friends, who maintained\r\nthat, not being in the Irish tongue, its proper designation was\r\nAnglo-Irish literature.\r\n\r\nI had the pleasure of making the acquaintance of one of the leading\r\nyoung Irelanders, Charles Gavan Duffy, after his return to this country,\r\nwhen he assisted at the inauguration of our London Irish Literary\r\nSociety, which has been a credit to the Irishmen of the metropolis. Much\r\nof the success of the Society is due to Alfred Perceval Graves, author\r\nof the well-known song \"Father O'Flynn,\" a faithful picture of a genuine\r\nIrish _soggarth_. Among others of the members of the society who have\r\nmade their mark in Irish literature is Mr. Richard Barry O'Brien, the\r\nPresident, the author of several valuable works of history and\r\nbiography.\r\n\r\nIt was at the opening of our Literary Society that I first met Duffy in\r\nthe flesh, but I had known and admired him in spirit from my earliest\r\nboyhood. I was greatly pleased when he told me he had been much\r\ninterested in my publications, not only those issued more recently, but\r\nthose of many years before. I afterwards had a letter from him in\r\nreference to my \"Irish in Britain,\" in which he said: \"I saw long ago\r\nsome of the little Irish books you published in Liverpool, and know you\r\nfor an old and zealous worker in the national seed field.\"\r\n\r\nHis son, George Gavan Duffy, is a solicitor, practising in London, and\r\nan active worker in the national cause. His wife is a daughter of the\r\nlate A.M. Sullivan, and is as zealous a Nationalist as was her father,\r\nand as patriotic as her husband.\r\n\r\nThe first book of National poetry I ever read was one compiled by\r\nCharles Gavan Duffy--\"The Ballad Poetry of Ireland.\" I should say that\r\nthis has been one of the most popular books ever issued. There are none\r\nof his own songs in this volume. The few he did write are in the \"Spirit\r\nof the Nation\" and other collections. These make us regret he did not\r\nwrite more, for, in the whole range of our poetry, I think there is\r\nnothing finer or more soul-stirring than his \"Inishowen,\" \"The Irish\r\nRapparees,\" and \"The Men of the North.\"\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate that we have nothing from the pen of Thomas Davis on\r\nthe subject of the Irish drama and dramatists, for among the most\r\ndelightful and valuable contributions to the Anglo-Irish literature of\r\nthe nineteenth century were his \"Literary and Historical Essays.\"\r\n\r\nFor students, historians, journalists, lecturers, and public speakers,\r\nthey have been an inexhaustible mine, since they first appeared week by\r\nweek in the \"Nation\" during the Repeal and Young Ireland movements. As\r\nsources of inspiration they have been of still more practical value to\r\nthe Irish poet, painter, musician and sculptor.\r\n\r\nThough he was apparently in good health up to a few days of his death,\r\nwhich was quite unexpected, Davis, in giving to his country these\r\nunsurpassed essays, might have had some idea that his life would not be\r\na long one, and that, if he could not himself accomplish all he had\r\nprojected, he would at least sketch out a programme for his brother\r\nworkers in the national field, and for those coming after them.\r\n\r\nA glance at the contents of Davis's Essays will show how fully he has\r\ncovered almost every field in which Irishmen are or ought to be\r\ninterested. We have Irish History, Antiquities, Monuments, Architecture,\r\nEthnology, Oratory, Resources, Topography, Commerce, Art, Language, Our\r\nPeople of all classes, Music and Poetry dealt with in an attractive as\r\nwell as in a practical manner. Anyone who has ever gone to these Essays,\r\nas I have over and over again, for information, has always found Davis\r\ncompletely master of every subject that he touched. His \"Hints to Irish\r\nPainters\" are illustrations of the value of the advice he gives in\r\nconnection with his varied themes. Those of the generations since his\r\ntime who have profited by his teaching know best how valuable would have\r\nbeen his views in connection with the Irish Drama.\r\n\r\nKnowing as we do how _thorough_ Davis was in everything he took up, the\r\nreason he did not deal with it was, probably, that he had not had the\r\nsame opportunities of getting information on this as upon the other\r\nwonderfully varied subjects in his Essays.\r\n\r\nI have in my mind at this moment one Irish dramatist, Edmond O'Rourke,\r\nwho would have appreciated anything Davis would have written on the\r\nsubject, and would certainly have profited by it.\r\n\r\nO'Rourke, better known by his stage name of Falconer, was an actor as\r\nwell as a dramatist. He was \"leading man\" when I first saw him in the\r\nstock company of the Adelphi Theatre, Liverpool, and used to play the\r\nwhole round of Shakespearean characters, his favourite parts being the\r\npopular ones of Macbeth, Hamlet, and Richard the Third. He was a\r\ndark-complexioned man of average height, somewhat spare in form and\r\nfeatures. Though his performances were intellectual creations, we boys\r\nused to make somewhat unfavourable comparisons between him and Barry\r\nSullivan, another of our fellow-countrymen. Barry was by no means\r\nsuperior to Falconer in his conception of the various parts, but he\r\ngreatly surpassed him in voice, physique, and general bearing on the\r\nstage, in which respects I think he had no equal in our times.\r\n\r\nAfter Falconer went to London he became manager of the Lyceum Theatre,\r\nwhere several of his pieces were performed, including the well-known\r\nIrish drama, \"Peep o' Day,\" which had an enormously successful run. With\r\nthis he also produced a magnificent panorama of Killarney, to illustrate\r\nwhich he wrote the well-known song of \"Killarney\" which, with the music\r\nof Balfe, our Irish composer, at once became very popular, as it ever\r\nsince has been. Madame Anna Whitty, the distinguished vocalist, who\r\nfirst sang \"Killarney,\" was a daughter of Michael James Whitty, of whom\r\nI have spoken elsewhere. In going through my papers I have just come\r\nacross a letter from O'Rourke, dated from the Princess's Theatre,\r\nManchester, August 19th, 1872, in which he tells me of the great success\r\nin Manchester of another play of his, \"Eileen Oge.\" This also he\r\nproduced at the Lyceum Theatre, London, where it had a long and\r\nsuccessful run. Edmund O'Rourke was a patriotic Irishman, and in this\r\nrespect I could never have made the same comparison between the\r\npatriotism of the two men, Barry Sullivan and him, as I did between them\r\nas actors. _Both_ were patriotic Irishmen. It will be remembered that in\r\nan early chapter of this book I have mentioned that Barry Sullivan once\r\noffered himself to our committee as an Irish Nationalist candidate for\r\nthe parliamentary representation of Liverpool.\r\n\r\nDion Boucicault, too, is one, I am sure, who would have profited by\r\nanything Thomas Davis might have written on the subject of the drama. I\r\nam quite satisfied that though he was severely criticised for the wake\r\nscene in his play of \"The Shaughraun\" at the time it was first produced,\r\nthe objectionable features in this were more the fault of the actors\r\nthan of the dramatist; but the subject was an exceedingly risky one,\r\neven for a man like Boucicault, and would have been better avoided\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nBesides Barry Sullivan and Falconer, other Irish actors I knew were\r\nBarry Aylmer, James Foster O'Neill, and Hubert O'Grady. They were\r\nimpersonators of what were known as \"Irish parts,\" and being genuine\r\nIrish Nationalists, as well as actors, did much to elevate the character\r\nof such performances. For with them, all the wit and drollery were\r\nretained, while they helped, by their example, to banish the buffoonery\r\nthat used to characterise the \"Stage Irishman.\"\r\n\r\nI am reminded by a criticism on one of his pieces in a London daily\r\npaper that we can claim, as a fellow-countryman, perhaps the most\r\nbrilliant writer at the present time for the British stage--George\r\nBernard Shaw. From a conversation I had with him once, I would certainly\r\ngather that he was a patriotic Irishman.\r\n\r\nI have done something in the way of dramatic production myself, one of\r\nthe pieces I wrote being at the request of Father Nugent, to assist him\r\nin the great temperance movement he had started in Liverpool. He engaged\r\na large hall in Bevington Bush, where every Monday night he gave the\r\ntotal abstinence pledge against intoxicating liquors to large numbers of\r\npeople. I was then carrying on the \"Catholic Times\" for him, and he\r\nasked me to be the first to take the pledge from him at his public\r\ninauguration of the movement. Although, as he was aware, I was already a\r\npledged teetotaler to Father Mathew, I was greatly pleased to agree to\r\nassist him all I could in his great work.\r\n\r\nHe believed in providing a counter-attraction to the public house, and\r\neach Monday night, in the Bevington Hall, he provided a concert or some\r\nother kind of entertainment; giving, in the interval between the first\r\nand second part a stirring address and the temperance pledge. As there\r\nwas a stage and scenery in the hall, we often had dramatic sketches. The\r\ndrama I wrote for Father Nugent had a temperance moral. It was called\r\n\"The Germans of Glenmore.\" It was played several Monday nights in\r\nsuccession, and was well received.\r\n\r\nSome years afterwards I made it into a story, calling it \"The Reapers of\r\nKilbride.\" This appeared over a frequent signature of mine, \"Slieve\r\nDonard,\" in the \"United Irishman,\" the organ of the Home Rule\r\nConfederation.\r\n\r\nSingularly enough, I found that part of it had been changed back again\r\ninto the first act of a drama by Mr. Hubert O'Grady, the well-known\r\nIrish comedian.\r\n\r\nThat gentleman was giving a performance for the benefit of the newly\r\nreleased political prisoners at one of our Liverpool theatres. Being\r\nsomewhat late, I was making my way upstairs in company with Michael\r\nDavitt, and the play had commenced. I could hear on the stage part of\r\nthe dialogue, which seemed familiar to me, and, sure enough, when I\r\ntook my seat and listened to the rest of the act, the dialogue was\r\npretty nearly, word for word, from \"The Reapers of Kilbride.\" The\r\ncompiler of the play being acted had also drawn upon another drama of\r\nmine for his last act, \"Rosaleen Dhu, or the Twelve Pins of Bin-a-Bola.\"\r\nThe play we were witnessing was very cleverly constructed, for Mr.\r\nO'Grady, with his strong dramatic instincts and experience, could tell\r\nexactly what would go well, and could use material accordingly. The\r\ntransformation of the story as it appeared in the \"United Irishman\" back\r\nagain into a play would be easily effected, as, leaving out the\r\ndescriptive part, the dialogue itself, with the necessary stage\r\ndirections, told the story. This, no doubt, Mr. O'Grady had perceived.\r\n\r\nLater still, I carried out a similar transformation with another of my\r\nown productions. I have a piece in three acts which, as a play, has\r\nnever been published or performed. It is called \"The Curse of\r\nColumbkille.\" This drama I changed into a story, which has appeared in\r\nthe series of 6d. novels published by Messrs. Sealy, Bryers and Walker.\r\nThe most striking character in it is Olaf, a Dane, who believes himself\r\nto be a re-incarnation of one of the old Danish sea rovers. A member of\r\nthe firm, the late Mr. George Bryers, a sterling Irishman, called my\r\nattention to the opinion of the professional reader to the firm that it\r\nwould be advisable to call the story \"Olaf the Dane; or the Curse of\r\nColumbkille.\" I accepted the suggestion, and accordingly the book has\r\nbeen published with that title.\r\n\r\nI have seen with much interest the movement inaugurated by the Irish\r\nTheatre Company in Dublin, and have been present at some of their\r\nperformances in London. In spite of some false starts and a tendency to\r\nimitate certain undesirable foreign influences, the movement should\r\ncertainly help to foster the Irish drama.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\n\"HOW IS OLD IRELAND AND HOW DOES SHE STAND?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSumming up these pages, how shall I answer the question asked by Napper\r\nTandy in \"The Wearin' of the Green\" over a hundred years ago--\"How is\r\nold Ireland, and how does she stand?\"\r\n\r\nLet us see what changes, for the better or for the worse, there have\r\nbeen during the period--nearly seventy years--covered by these\r\nrecollections.\r\n\r\nCatholic Emancipation had, five years before I was born, allowed our\r\npeople to raise their voices, and give their votes through their\r\nrepresentatives in an alien Parliament.\r\n\r\nI am not one to say that no benefit for Ireland has arisen through\r\nlegislation at Westminster, but the system that allowed our people to\r\nperish of starvation has always been, to my mind, the one great\r\njustification for our struggle for self-government by every practicable\r\nmethod. It has been a struggle for sheer existence.\r\n\r\nIf Ireland had had the making of her own laws when the potato crop\r\nfailed, not a single human being would have perished from starvation.\r\nThat I am justified in introducing the terrible Irish Famine and its\r\nconsequences into these recollections as part of my own experiences I\r\nthink I have shown in my description of its effects upon our people\r\nwhen passing through Liverpool as emigrants or as settlers in England.\r\n\r\nI have always endeavoured to look upon the most hopeful aspects of the\r\nIrish question. But with the appalling tragedy of the Famine half way in\r\nthe last century, with half our people gone and the population still\r\ndiminishing, one is bound to admit that the nineteenth century was one\r\nof the most disastrous in Irish history.\r\n\r\nIs it surprising that, during my time, driven desperate at the sight of\r\na perishing people in one of the most fruitful lands on earth, we should\r\nhave made two attempts at rebellion?\r\n\r\nIn 1848 the means were totally inadequate.\r\n\r\nIn 1867 the movement looked more hopeful in many respects. The\r\nrevolutionary organisation had a large number of enrolled members on\r\nboth sides of the Atlantic. Among them were hundreds in the British\r\narmy, and many thousands of Irish-American veterans trained in the Civil\r\nWar, eager to wipe off the score of centuries in a conflict, on\r\nsomething like equal terms, with the olden oppressor of their race.\r\n\r\nBut the real hope of success lay in the prospect of a war between\r\nAmerica and England, which at one time seemed imminent, and justified\r\nthe action of the Fenian chiefs in their preparations.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, the very existence of Fenianism which, more than any\r\nother cause, prevented war. For none knew better than far-seeing\r\nstatesmen like Mr. Gladstone (who declared that he was prompted to\r\nremedial measures for Ireland by \"the intensity of Fenianism\") that\r\nwithin a month of the commencement of a war between America and England,\r\nIreland would be lost to the British crown for ever. That is why English\r\nstatesmen would have grovelled in the dust before America, rather than\r\nengage in a conflict with her.\r\n\r\nThe generous way in which the Irish exiles in America have poured their\r\nwealth into the lap of their island mother, and the determination they\r\nhave shown to shed their blood for her just as freely, should the\r\nopportunity only come, are the features which to some extent\r\ncounterbalance the tragedy of the Famine. For that terrible calamity, by\r\ndriving our people out in millions, raised a power on the side of\r\nIreland which her oppressors could not touch, a power which is no doubt\r\namong the means intended by Providence to hasten our coming day of\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, emigration, the most unanswerable proof of English\r\nmisgovernment, is a terrible drain on our country's life-blood, and no\r\nentirely hopeful view of Ireland's future can be held until this is\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\nWhat, however, are the reflections which bring encouragement?\r\n\r\nOne is that the time cannot be far distant when some statesman of the\r\ntype of Gladstone will try to avert the danger threatening the British\r\nempire through an ever-discontented Ireland, by conceding to her at\r\nleast the amount of self-government possessed by Canada and Australia.\r\n\r\nTo this one section of Englishmen will say \"Never!\" Students of history\r\nhave many times heard the \"Never\" of English statesmen, and know how\r\noften it has proved futile. Before I was born they were saying \"Never\"\r\nto Catholic Emancipation. Later on they said \"Never\" to the demand for\r\ntenant-right. A few years ago, when fighting the Boers, they said\r\n\"Never\" to the suggestion that the war should be ended on conditions.\r\nEven now economic causes and the competition of rival powers are at work\r\nin such a way that it is plain that the existence of the British Empire\r\nis at stake. England's one chance lies in the possibility of the\r\nfriendship of the free democratic commonwealths which are at present her\r\ncolonies--and of Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe establishing of County Councils in Ireland and Great Britain was an\r\nacceptance of the principle of Home Rule. Their successful working has\r\ncaused the belief in that principle to gain ground. Their administration\r\nin Ireland has shown that in no part of the British empire does there\r\nexist a greater capacity for self-government. All creeds and classes\r\nthere have found the material benefit arising from them, for instead of\r\ntheir finances being managed by irresponsible boards, the money of the\r\npeople is now wisely spent by their elected representatives.\r\n\r\nMoreover, if there is one thing that is certain, it is that the _future_\r\nis on our side. In my own time I have seen a most startling change come\r\nover the attitude of the working classes of England towards Ireland as\r\nthey progressed in knowledge and political power themselves. They are\r\nthe certain rulers of England to-morrow, the men whose democratic ideals\r\nare our own, and who have in fact largely been trained by us. Their rise\r\nmeans the fall of the system that has mis-governed Ireland. Thus every\r\nday brings nearer the triumph of our ideal, the ideal of freedom, which\r\nwill probably be worked out in the form of Ireland governing herself and\r\nworking harmoniously with a democratic self-governing England.\r\n\r\nThe unquestionable growing desire among the people of Wales and Scotland\r\nto manage their own affairs proceeds largely from their having felt the\r\nbenefits of _local_ self-government in their County Councils. Their\r\nprejudice against _National_ self-government for Ireland, and for\r\nthemselves, too, should they desire it, is rapidly breaking down. In\r\nthis connection, too, we must never forget what an enormous power we\r\nhave in the two millions and more of Irishmen and men of Irish\r\nextraction in Great Britain, and that, under ordinary circumstances,\r\nthey hold the balance of power between British parties in about 150\r\nParliamentary constituencies.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the Irish land question, we have every reason to be\r\nhopeful of the final and complete success of the great movement\r\ncommenced by the organisation founded by Michael Davitt.\r\n\r\nWe have had, since the days of Strongbow, many conquests and\r\nconfiscations and settlements, the main object of each being the\r\nacquisition of the land of Ireland. Is it not marvellous,\r\nnotwithstanding all the attempts to destroy our people, how they have\r\nclung to the soil and so absorbed the foreign element that you still so\r\noften find the old tribal names in the old tribal lands? Apart from\r\nthis, we have, in the descendants of the various invaders, what would be\r\na most valuable element in a self-governing Ireland, for whatever be the\r\ncreed or the race from which men have sprung, it is but natural that all\r\nshould love alike the land of their birth. As a result of Michael\r\nDavitt's labours, that land is to-day more nearly than it has been for\r\ncenturies the property of the people, and it seems now, humanly\r\nspeaking, impossible that they should ever be dispossessed of it again.\r\n\r\nThen there is the improvement in education. At one time it was banned\r\nand hunted along with religion and patriotism. Then it was permitted,\r\nwith a view of turning it into a lever against the other two elements.\r\nConcessions have so far been wrung from the British parliament that\r\nthere is now a university to which Irish youths can be sent. Here there\r\nis a great factor for good, for while, on the one hand, knowledge is\r\npower, on the other hand the thirst for knowledge has always been\r\nineradicable in the Irish character. There are also the beginnings of\r\ntechnical training so long badly needed. Under self-government we should\r\nhave been a couple of generations earlier in the race than we are, but\r\nit is not too late.\r\n\r\nLastly, in reckoning up the conditions from which we can take hope and\r\ncomfort there is this: In the darkest hour we have never lost faith in\r\nourselves and our Cause. To find a parallel for such tenacity in the\r\npages of the history of any land would be difficult.\r\n\r\nWe come of a race that, through the long, dreary centuries, has never\r\nknown despair, nor shall we despair now. I am assured that, before long,\r\nthe drain on our life blood that has gone on for sixty years will stop,\r\nand that we shall stand on solid ground at last, ready for an upward\r\nspring.\r\n\r\nAnd so, to the young men of Ireland I would say: Be true to yourselves;\r\nhold fast to the ideals which your fathers preserved through the\r\ncenturies, in spite of savage force and unscrupulous statecraft. The\r\ntimes are changing; new impulses are constantly shaping the destinies of\r\nthe nations; have confidence in God and your country; and who shall dare\r\nto say that the future of Ireland may not yet be a glorious recompense\r\nfor the heroism with which she has borne the sufferings of the past.\r\n\r\n                                   THE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  INDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  A.\r\n\r\n  Alabama Claims, 75.\r\n\r\n  Allen, Larkin, and O'Brien condemned and executed, 104.\r\n\r\n  Ambulances, Irish, for Franco-Prussian War, 160, 161.\r\n\r\n  Amnesty Association and O'Connell Centenary, 183.\r\n\r\n  Ancient Fenians, 52.\r\n\r\n  Anderson, Arthur, resembled Corydon, 85.\r\n\r\n  \"Annesley's Mountain, Lord,\" 31, 47.\r\n\r\n  Answers to Correspondents, 154.\r\n\r\n  Antrim, my birthplace, 2.\r\n\r\n  Archbishops Crolly and Murray support the Bequest Act, 30.\r\n\r\n  Archdeacon, George, 52.\r\n\r\n  Architectural Drawing and Surveying, employed at these, 54.\r\n\r\n  Arms for Rising of 1867.
