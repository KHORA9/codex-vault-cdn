The passing of the century has brought a fairer\r\nappraisement of Jackson’s character and career, but he remains, and ever\r\nmust, a subject of controversy, because he was a crusader for certain\r\nfundamentals of government on which men divide honestly. His civic\r\nintegrity, his flaming patriotism, and his robust Americanism are beyond\r\nall controversy, and men of all political persuasions do homage to his\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\nWith a world-wide movement against democracy to-day, and with striking\r\nmanifestations of its existence here, it is well for Americans to ponder\r\nthe lessons of the struggle for its preservation by Jackson and the\r\nmasses whom he led with such superb courage and consummate ability.\r\nThere is little being urged against it now that was not heard during the\r\nperiod of his leadership. It had never been in more deadly danger than\r\nwhen he met its enemies in bitter battle. And now, after a hundred\r\nyears, there are indications that the battle he fought successfully must\r\nbe fought again, if the elemental ideas he stood for are to survive in\r\ngovernmental practice.\r\n\r\nIn some of the reviews of the first edition it was suggested that I had\r\nbeen “hard on John Quincy Adams.” A careful reading convinces me that\r\nthe conclusion is not justified. Such was not my intention or desire.\r\nThough often petty in small things, he was always heroic in big things,\r\nand these determine the character of a public man. In the chapters on\r\nthe French quarrel I have sought to show him at his best, sinking his\r\npartisanship in his Americanism, and subordinating his personal\r\nprejudices to his patriotism.\r\n\r\n                                                       CLAUDE G. BOWERS\r\n\r\n_March 16, 1928_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is the purpose of the author to deal, more minutely than is possible\r\nin a general history or biography, with the brilliant, dramatic, and\r\nepochal party battles and the fascinating personalities of the eight\r\nyears of Andrew Jackson’s Administrations. From the foundation of the\r\nRepublic to the last two years of the Wilson Administration, the Nation\r\nhas never known such party acrimony; nor has there been a period when\r\nthe contending party organizations have been led by such extraordinary\r\npoliticians and orators. It was, in a large sense, the beginning of\r\nparty government as we have come to understand it. It was not until the\r\nJacksonian epoch that we became a democracy in fact. The selection of\r\nPresidents then passed from the caucus of the politicians in the capital\r\nto the plain people of the factories, fields, and marts. The\r\nenfranchisement of thousands of the poor, previously excluded from the\r\nfranchise, and the advent of the practical organization politicians,\r\nwrought the change. Our government, as never before, became one of\r\nparties, with well-defined, antagonistic principles and policies. Party\r\ndiscipline and continuous propaganda became recognized essentials to\r\nparty success.\r\n\r\nThis period witnessed the origin of modern party methods. The spoils\r\nsystem, instead of being a mere manifestation of some viciousness in\r\nJackson, grew out of the assumed necessity for rewarding party service.\r\nThe recognition of party government brought the national convention. The\r\nnew power of the masses necessitated compact and drilled party\r\norganizations down to the precincts of the most remote sections, and\r\neven the card-index system known to-day was part of the plan of the\r\nincomparable politicians of the Kitchen Cabinet. The transfer of\r\nauthority from the small coterie of politicians to the people in the\r\ncorn rows imposed upon the leaders the obligation to furnish the rank\r\nand file of their followers with political ammunition for the skirmishes\r\nat the country stores as well as for the heavy engagements at the polls,\r\nand out of this sprang the intense development of the party press, the\r\ndelivery of congressional speeches for “home consumption,” the party\r\nplatform, and the keynote speech.\r\n\r\nThe triumph of the Jacksonians over the Clays, the Websters, and the\r\nCalhouns was due, in large measure, to their development of the first\r\ngreat practical politicians--that much-depreciated company sneeringly\r\nreferred to as the Kitchen Cabinet, to whom all politicians since have\r\npaid the tribute of imitation.\r\n\r\nWith the appearance of Democracy in action came some evils that have\r\npersisted through the succeeding years--the penalties of the rule of the\r\npeople. Demagogy then reared its head and licked its tongue. Class\r\nconsciousness and hatreds were awakened. And, on the part of the great\r\ncorporations, intimidation, coercion, and the corrupt use of money to\r\ncontrol elections were contributed. These evils are a heritage of the\r\nbitter party battles of the Jacksonian period--battles as brilliant as\r\nthey were bitter.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this volume is to describe these mad party struggles, and\r\nto picture, as they really were, the great historical figures, “warts\r\nand all.” If Henry Clay is here shown as an unscrupulous, selfish,\r\nscheming politician, rather than as the mythical figure who “would\r\nrather be right than President”; if John C. Calhoun is here described as\r\npetty in his personal hates and spites and in his resentment over the\r\nfailure of personal ambitions; if Daniel Webster, the most admirable of\r\nthe three during these eight vivid years, is set forth, not only as the\r\ngreat Nationalist who replied to Hayne and sustained Jackson’s\r\nNullification Proclamation, but as the defender of the Bank from which,\r\nat the beginning of the fight, he bluntly solicited a “refreshment” of\r\nhis retainer, it is not through any desire to befoul their fame, but to\r\nset down the truth as irrefutably disclosed in the records, and to\r\ndepict them as they were--intensely human in their moral limitations.\r\n\r\nThe necessities of history happily call for the featuring of some\r\nfigures, potent in their generation, attractive in their genius, and\r\nnecessarily passed over by historians covering much longer periods. No\r\nclose-up picture of the time can be painted that ignores Edward\r\nLivingston, patriot and philosopher; Roger B. Taney, the militant party\r\nleader; John Forsyth, the “greatest debater of his time”; John M.\r\nClayton, the real master of both Calhoun and Clay in the Compromise of\r\n1833; George McDuffie, the tempestuous Danton of the Opposition; Hugh\r\nLawson White, the “Cato of the Senate” and the Nemesis of Jacksonian\r\nDemocracy; William Cabell Preston and Horace Binney, the polished\r\norators, now almost forgotten; Major Lewis, the master of political\r\ndetails; Frank Blair, the slashing journalistic champion of the\r\nAdministration; and Amos Kendall, the genius of the Kitchen Cabinet.\r\n\r\nAn analysis of motives and methods has led to some unconventional\r\nconclusions. Not only do Clay, Webster, and Calhoun dwindle in moral\r\ngrandeur, but others, traditionally considered small, loom large. Thus\r\nthe John Tyler of these eight years stands out in intellectual honesty,\r\ncourage, and consistency far beyond others to whom history has been more\r\ngenerous.\r\n\r\nNo apology need be offered for featuring the personalities of the time.\r\nThey throw light on motives and explain events. The episode of Mrs.\r\nEaton changed the current of political history. The gossip concerning\r\nMrs. White indicates the putridity of political factionalism. The\r\nscurrilous biography of Van Buren written by Davie Crockett on the\r\nsuggestion of Senator White is illuminative of the popular prejudices\r\nof the times; and the solemn investigation of the charge that Senator\r\nPoindexter had instigated the attempt upon the life of the President at\r\nthe Capitol discloses the morbidity of the partisan madness. Through the\r\ngossip of the drawing-rooms, the jottings of the diaries, the editorial\r\ncomments of the contemporary press, the social and political intrigues\r\nof women, the attempt is made to re-create something of the atmosphere\r\nby which the remarkable statesmen and politicians of the Jackson\r\nAdministrations were affected.\r\n\r\nGenerations have been taught to respect or reverence the memories of the\r\nextraordinary men of the Thirties who rode on the whirlwind to direct\r\nthe storms; and, their human weaknesses forgotten, their sinister,\r\nselfish purposes ignored, their moral or intellectual limitations\r\noverlooked, they seem, in the perspective of the years, stern, austere,\r\nalways sincere, and singularly free from the vices of politicians, as we\r\nhave come to know them in the leaders of a later day. And yet it would\r\nbe difficult to find creatures more thoroughly human than these who are\r\nusually presented to us as steel engravings, hung high on the wall in a\r\ndim light. They move across the page of history scarcely touching or\r\nsuffering the contamination of the ground. They seem to play their parts\r\nupon a stage impressive and imposing, suspended between earth and\r\nheaven. That they lived in houses, danced, gambled and drank, flattered\r\nand flirted, gossiped and lied, in a Washington of unpaved streets and\r\nsticky black mud, made their way to night conferences through dark,\r\ntreacherous thoroughfares, and played their brilliant parts in a\r\nbedraggled, village-like capital, is not apt to occur to one. Thus, in\r\ntracing the political drama of this portentous period, an attempt is\r\nmade to facilitate the realization that they were flesh and blood, and\r\nmere men to their contemporaries, not always heroic or even admirable,\r\nthrough the visualization of the daily life they lived in a capital\r\npeculiarly crude and filled with grotesque incongruities.\r\n\r\nNo period in American political history is so susceptible to\r\ndramatization. There is grim tragedy in the baffled ambitions of Calhoun\r\nand Clay; romance in the rise of Kendall and the fall of Mrs. Eaton;\r\nrich comedy, when viewed behind the scenes, in the lugubrious procession\r\nof “distress petitioners” trained to tears by the art of Clay and the\r\nmoney of Biddle; and rollicking farce in the early morning flight of a\r\ndismissed Cabinet minister, to escape the apprehended chastisement of an\r\nerstwhile colleague whose wife’s good name had been assailed.\r\n\r\nThe drama of party politics, with its motives of love, hate, and\r\nvaulting ambition--such is the unidealized story of the epochal period\r\nwhen the iron will of the physically feeble Jackson dominated the life\r\nof the Nation, and colored the politics of the Republic for a century.\r\n\r\nThe Drama--its motives--its actors--such the theme of this history.\r\n\r\n                                                       CLAUDE G.

The journey from Philadelphia to Baltimore was\r\nusually made by boat through the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, and the\r\nentire trip, in winter one of exposure, required the greater part of two\r\ndays.[1] The fare from Baltimore to Washington was four dollars.\r\nSometimes the ruts in the winter roads would overturn the coach,\r\nthrowing the passengers into the mire, and occasionally resulting in\r\nsprains and broken bones.[2] Later in Jackson’s time, the Baltimore &\r\nOhio Railroad was built, with a branch into Washington, and when the\r\nfirst cars, drawn by horses, reached the country-town capital, the\r\nenthusiastic statesmen felt that the problem of transportation had been\r\nsolved. Urging Butler to accept the attorney-generalship, and stressing\r\nthe fact that acceptance would not preclude his appearance in personal\r\ncases in New York and Albany, Van Buren made much of the fact that “to\r\nthe former place you will next season be able to go in fifteen hours,\r\nand to the latter in a day and a night.”[3] Blair, of the “Globe,”\r\nboasted after the election of 1832 that “in eight days and nights after\r\nthe closing of the polls in Ohio, the result was known in the city of\r\nWashington from all the organized counties except three.” This, he\r\ndeclared, “is an instance of rapid communication from the West\r\nunparalleled in this country.”[4]\r\n\r\nThe foreigner, expecting a national capital more or less pretentious and\r\ncompact, was invariably shocked on entering the environs over miserable\r\nmud roads, to find only an occasional drab hut or cottage at wide\r\nintervals. Usually, until the Capitol attracted his attention, he was\r\nwholly unconscious of his arrival at his destination. One of these, who\r\nhas left a record of his visit, relates that he was “looking from the\r\nwindow of his coach in a sort of brown study, at fields covered with\r\nsnow,” when a fellow passenger startled him with the inquiry as to how\r\nhe liked Washington.\r\n\r\n“I will tell you when I see it,” he replied.\r\n\r\n“Why, you have been in Washington the last quarter of an hour,” was the\r\nrejoinder.[5]\r\n\r\nAnother famous visitor “was taken by surprise” on finding herself within\r\nthe shadow of the hall of the lawmakers, “so sordid are the enclosures\r\nand houses on its very verge.”[6]\r\n\r\nBut as the coach wound round the Capitol, and swung with a merry clatter\r\ninto Pennsylvania Avenue, the houses at more frequent intervals and\r\nconnected shops disclosed the town. With a characteristic “clatter and\r\nclamp,”[7] with a gay cracking of whips, the coach would splash and\r\nrumble up to one of the leading hotels, and the cramped and weary\r\ntourist would joyously take leave of the conveyance and seek lodgment\r\nwithin.\r\n\r\nIf well advised, he would instruct the coachman to drop him at Gadsby’s,\r\nthen the most popular and comfortable hostelry in town, on the Avenue, a\r\nshort distance from the Capitol.[8] There he would find, not only a\r\nclean bed, but excellent service and a lordly hospitality from the host.\r\nGadsby, for his generation, was a genius at his trade. He moved his\r\nsmall army of negro servants with military precision. “Who that ever\r\nknew the hospitalities of this gentlemanly and most liberal Boniface,”\r\nwrote one who enjoyed them, “can ever forget his urbane manner, his\r\ncareful attention to his guests, his well-ordered house, his fine old\r\nwines, and the princely manner in which he could send his bottle of\r\nchoice Madeira to some old friend or favored guest at the table?”[9] It\r\nwas not always, however, that accommodations could be found at Gadsby’s,\r\nand then the tourist would seek the Indian Queen at the sign of the\r\nluridly painted picture of Pocahontas, where he would be met at the curb\r\nby Jesse Brown, the landlord.[10] Here, for a dollar and a quarter a\r\nday, he could not only find a pleasant room, but a table loaded with\r\ndecanters of brandy, rum, gin, at short intervals from the head to the\r\nfoot. If the host of the Indian Queen lacked the lordly elegance of\r\nGadsby, he made up for it in the homely virtues of hospitality. Wearing\r\na large white apron, he met his guests at the door of the dining-room,\r\nand then hastened to the head of the table where he personally carved\r\nand helped to serve the principal dish.[11] If this, too, was crowded,\r\nthe tourist would try Fuller’s near the White House,[12] where a room\r\nwould be found for him either in the hotel proper, or in one of the two\r\nor three houses adjoining, which had been converted into an annex.[13]\r\n\r\nHaving rested from his journey and removed the stains of travel, if he\r\nwere a person of some importance, and especially a foreigner, he would\r\nbe speedily deluged with the cards of callers anxious to make his\r\nsojourn pleasant. Day by day the hotel registers were eagerly scanned\r\nfor the names of visiting celebrities, for the Washington of the\r\nThirties loved its lions and lionesses. No possible person was ever\r\nneglected, and real personages were fêted, wined, and dined. But not\r\nuntil he set forth to return the calls would he appreciate the\r\nPortuguese Minister’s description of the capital as “a city of\r\nmagnificent distances.” Inquiring at the hotel how to reach the\r\nresidences of his callers, he would be not a little puzzled at the\r\nnonchalant reply that the coachmen “knew where all the prominent people\r\nlive.” Engaging a coach, he would set forth gayly, in the confident\r\nexpectation of leaving his card at from thirty to forty houses in the\r\ncourse of the day. A short drive would take him to the end of the\r\nmacadamized pavement of the Avenue, and thereafter for hours, pitching\r\nand plunging, over the ruts and the mud-holes, through miry lanes, and\r\nacross vacant lots, shaken in body, and sore in spirit, he would find by\r\nevening that he had reached six or seven of the forty houses, and was\r\ncharged by the coachman at a rate “which would keep a chariot and two\r\nposters for twice the time in London.”[14] In the course of a week he\r\nwould find that he had spent as much as thirty dollars for coach\r\nhire--by odds, the most expensive feature of his Washington sojourn. An\r\nEnglish visitor, startled at the cost of travel, contracted with a\r\ncoachman for services from five o’clock to daylight for twenty dollars,\r\nbut after having attended five parties on the first evening, the morose\r\ndriver repudiated his contract, and it was necessary to add five dollars\r\nto retain his services.[15] “I should imagine [Washington] to be the\r\nvery paradise of hackney coachmen,” wrote one disgusted visitor. “If\r\nthese men do not get rich it must be owing to some culpable\r\nextravagance, for their vehicles are in continual demand from the hour\r\nof dinner[16] till five in the morning, and long distances and heavy\r\ncharges are all in their favor.”[17]\r\n\r\nAs the visitor drove about the town he found nothing in the physical\r\naspects of the country-town capital to indicate that L’Enfant ever had a\r\nvision or produced a plan for a city beautiful. Because real estate\r\ndealers had quarreled over the location of public buildings, the\r\nselection of the hill for the Capitol had led to the location of the\r\nWhite House a mile or more to the west, and for three decades the\r\nproblem of building a compact city between the two had failed. The\r\nstreets were all unpaved when Jackson was first inaugurated, and only\r\nPennsylvania Avenue between the Capitol and the President’s Mansion had\r\nbeen rescued from the mire when he left office. Hub-deep in mud in\r\ninclement weather, these country roads sent forth great clouds of dust\r\non dry and sunny days. With the exception of the Avenue, not a single\r\nstreet approached compactness, the houses on all other streets being\r\noccasionally grouped, but generally widely separated, and in some\r\ninstances so much so as to suggest country houses with their shade trees\r\nand vegetable gardens.[18] “It looks as if it had rained naked buildings\r\nupon an open plain, and every man had made a street in reference to his\r\nown door,” wrote Nathaniel P. Willis, who knew his Washington.[19]\r\nAnother writer of the day who was impressed with “the houses scattered\r\nin straggling groups, three in one quarter, and half a dozen in\r\nanother,” was moved to compassion for “some disconsolate dwelling, the\r\nfirst or last born of a square or crescent, yet in nebulous suffering\r\nlike an ancient maiden in the mournful solitude of single\r\nblessedness.”[20] Still another contemporary word painter tells us that\r\neven on the Avenue “the buildings were standing with wide spaces\r\nbetween, like the teeth of some superannuated crone.”[21]\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the Capitol, itself beautiful even then, were desolate\r\nwaste lands being reserved for some ultimate Botanical Gardens, and a\r\nfew miserable shack-like boarding-houses.[22] “Everybody knows that\r\nWashington has a capitol,” wrote a satirical English observer, “but the\r\nmisfortune is that the capitol wants a city. There it stands, reminding\r\nyou of a general without an army, only surrounded and followed by a\r\nparcel of ragged little dirty boys; for such is the appearance of the\r\ndirty, straggling, ill-built houses which lie at the foot of it.”[23]\r\nWhere the Smithsonian Institution has long stood were innumerable\r\nquagmires reeking with miasma.[24] About the President’s Mansion, a few\r\npretentious houses, several still handsome homes after almost a century,\r\nhad been built, and in this section, and in Georgetown, lived the people\r\nof fashion and the diplomats. “The Co’t end,” it was called. At the four\r\ncorners of the Mansion of the Presidents stood the plain brick buildings\r\noccupied by the State, Treasury, War, and Navy Departments. On Capitol\r\nHill a few good houses had been erected, especially on North A and New\r\nJersey Avenue, South. Other than these, and those west of the White\r\nHouse, there was little but pastures and enclosed fields in the eastern,\r\nsoutheastern, and northeastern sections of the town.[25] East of\r\nFourteenth Street, on the north side, but few houses had been built\r\nbeyond F Street, and the “country home” of William H. Crawford, at the\r\nnortheast corner of Fourteenth Street and Massachusetts Avenue, was\r\nstill considered as remote from town as on that winter day after his\r\ndefeat for the Presidency when no callers were expected because of the\r\nheavy snow.[26]\r\n\r\nLooking down upon the little town from the skylight of the Capitol,\r\nHarriet Martineau could plainly discern the “seven theoretical avenues,”\r\nbut with the exception of Pennsylvania, all were “bare and forlorn,”\r\nand the city which has become one of the most beautiful and impressive\r\nin the world could then present to the naked eye only “a few mean houses\r\ndotted about, the sheds of the navy yard on one bank of the Potomac, and\r\nthree or four villas on the other.”[27] With the streets full of ruts,\r\nthe sidewalks dotted with pools of muddy water, or in places overgrown\r\nwith grass, with cows pasturing on many of the streets now lined with\r\nelegant homes, and challenging the right of way with Marshall or Clay or\r\nJackson, it is not surprising that foreigners, even as late as the\r\nThirties, were moved to imitate the sarcasm of Tom Moore. The\r\ndifficulties of locomotion kept the pedestrian’s eyes upon the ground,\r\nand the inconveniences, in making calls, of crossing ditches and stiles,\r\nand walking alternately upon grass and pavement, and striking across\r\nfields to reach a street, were more noticeable than the noble trees that\r\nlined the avenues.[28] Wretched enough in the daytime, the poorly\r\nlighted streets at night were utterly impossible. “As for lights,” wrote\r\na contemporary, “if the pedestrian did not provide and carry his own, he\r\nwas in danger of discovering every mud-hole and sounding its\r\ndepths.”[29] More nearly possible to the fastidious were the narrower\r\nstreets of Georgetown, with its more imposing and interesting houses,\r\nand more select society, where many of the statesmen lived, and not a\r\nfew of the Government clerks, who rode horseback to the departments in\r\nthe morning.\r\n\r\nEven in the Thirties there were many beautiful drives and walks in the\r\nvicinity of Washington, and a few houses that were impressive to even\r\nthe most critical English visitor. Visible for many miles, and easily\r\nseen from the town, loomed the pillared white mansion of Arlington, then\r\nthe home of George Washington Custis, to which many of the aristocrats\r\nof the capital frequently found their way. There, during the Jacksonian\r\nperiod, Robert E. Lee, standing in the room, whence, across the river,\r\nhe could see the Capitol building, was united in marriage to the\r\ndaughter of the house.[30] Within the city the most imposing mansions\r\nwere those of John Tayloe, at Eighteenth Street and New York Avenue,\r\ndesigned by Thornton, and even then rich in political and social\r\nmemories,[31] and the handsome residence of John Van Ness, the work of\r\nLatrobe, built at a cost of sixty thousand dollars to make a fit setting\r\nfor the charm and beauty of Marcia Burns, at the foot of Seventeenth\r\nStreet, on the banks of the Potomac. From the doorstep the master and\r\nhis guests could watch the ships from across the sea mooring to the\r\ndocks of Alexandria, and the merchantmen, bound for the port of\r\nGeorgetown, laden with the riches of the West Indies.\r\n\r\nThe tourist in the Washington of the Thirties did not have the\r\nopportunity for sight-seeing that means so much to the capital visitor\r\nof to-day. Aside from the Capitol and the White House, there were no\r\npublic buildings of architectural distinction. The churches had “nothing\r\nabout them to attract attention,” and while St. John’s on Lafayette\r\nSquare was then summoning to worship, it did not at that time have the\r\nvirtue of quaintness or the mellowness of historical memories. A visit\r\nto the Patent Office was customarily made, and most tourists found\r\nsomething to interest them in the museum of the State Department, with\r\nits portraits of the Indian chiefs who had visited Washington.[32]\r\nOccasionally the venturesome would ascend to the skylight of the Capitol\r\nto survey the straggling and dreary town from the height.[33] But always\r\nthere was the dignified and stately white building of the lawmakers and\r\nof the Supreme Court, and thither tourists and citizens, men and women,\r\ndaily found their way for the entertainment that never failed.\r\nSurrounded by its terraces, its well-kept lawns, its profusion of\r\nshrubbery, the visitor reached the entrance over its “beautifully\r\ngravelled walks,”[34] and entered the rotunda with its four Trumbull\r\npaintings of Revolutionary scenes, to be more impressed with the vacant\r\nspaces for four more, and the explanation that “Congress cannot decide\r\non what artist to confer the honor.”[35] He would not fail to be\r\ndelighted with the classic little Senate Chamber, redolent of the genius\r\nof Latrobe, and with the ease with which he might ignore the tiny\r\ngallery to find a hearty welcome on the floor. If a foreigner, he would\r\nbe surprised to find a constant stream of fashionable ladies entering\r\nthe chamber, crowding the Senators, accepting their seats, and\r\nattracting attention with their “waving plumes glittering with all the\r\ncolors of the rainbow, and causing no little bustle.”[36] There he would\r\nsee Van Buren or Calhoun in the chair, and on the floor he would want to\r\nhave Webster, Clay, Benton, Forsyth, Preston, and Ewing pointed out. And\r\nperhaps, like Miss Martineau, he would leave with the impression that he\r\nhad “seen no assembly of chosen men and no company of the high born,\r\ninvested with the antique dignities of an antique realm, half so\r\nimposing to the imagination as this collection of stout-souled,\r\nfull-grown, original men brought together on the ground of their\r\nsupposed sufficiency, to work out the will of their diverse\r\nconstituencies.”[37]\r\n\r\nHaving seen the Senate, he would seek the House of Representatives.\r\nInquiring his way to the Strangers’ Gallery from the rotunda, he would\r\nbe directed to a narrow stairs, and, on ascending, would find himself in\r\na large room of many columns, the work of the architect of the Senate,\r\nlooking down upon the seats of members arranged in concentric rows.\r\nThence he would look down upon the bald head of the venerable Adams, the\r\nanæmic figure of Polk, the handsome form of Binney, and the ludicrous\r\nconglomeration of garbs representing the diverse tastes of the tailors\r\nof New York and the wilderness. If acquainted with one of the members,\r\nthe visitor might be invited to the corridor behind the Speaker’s desk,\r\nfitted with seats and sofas drawn about the fireplace at either end,\r\nwhere members and their guests were wont to lounge and smoke.[38] Having\r\nsatisfied himself with the chambers of the lawmakers, the visitor would\r\nwant to see the tribunal of interpretation, said by some to have more\r\npower in determining the law of the land than the members of Congress,\r\nand to observe the famous Marshall on the Supreme Bench. Descending to\r\nthe basement of the Capitol, immediately under the Senate, he would be\r\nshown into a small plain room with low ceiling, and “a certain\r\ncellar-like aspect which is not pleasant,”[39] and would probably be a\r\nlittle shocked at the figure of Justice, “a wooden figure with the eyes\r\nunfilleted, and grasping the scales like a groceress.”[40] On cushioned\r\nsofas, on either side of the room, he might, if a favorite orator were\r\nmaking an argument, see gayly dressed ladies--for, like the Senate\r\nChamber, the court was one of the fashionable resorts of the Thirties.\r\nBut there, he would find dignity and quiet and decorum, in striking\r\ncontrast with most of the American courts of that generation.[41] If\r\nfortunate, he might listen to the reading of a decision by Marshall, and\r\nobserve Butler, the Attorney-General, “his fingers playing among his\r\npapers, his thick black eyes and thin, tremulous lips for once fixed,\r\nhis small face pale with thought,” contrasting with the more composed\r\ncountenances of Clay and Webster.[42]\r\n\r\nIn the days of Jackson, comparatively few families had a permanent\r\nresidence in Washington, and to an English visitor the town had the\r\nappearance of a watering-place.[43] Many Senators and Representatives\r\nconsidered it so impossible that they left their families at home.[44]\r\nAttorney-General Butler at first refused to consider a position in the\r\nCabinet because “Mrs. Butler did not like the idea of bringing her\r\ndaughters up here.”[45] When the wives and daughters did accompany the\r\nstatesmen to the capital, it was the custom, with such as could afford\r\nto maintain an establishment, to take a house. These usually purchased,\r\nalbeit many of the more desirable residences that could be leased were\r\nnot for sale. An establishment could be maintained at a surprisingly low\r\ncost. Houses “suitable for the purposes of genteel people” could be had\r\nfor from $50 to $300 a year, and even the large mansions, many of them\r\nstanding and still occupied by fashionable families after almost a\r\ncentury, could be had for from $500 to $800 a year.[46] The servant\r\nproblem did not exist, for domestics could be employed in abundance for\r\n$4 a month.[47] The Southerners, bringing their slaves with them, or\r\nbuying them in the slave market at Alexandria, were able to entertain\r\nwith a lavish display which set the pace socially, and made the Southern\r\ndominance easy. Foreigners were impressed, after hearing a senatorial\r\norator rhapsodize in the Senate over the blessings of American liberty,\r\nto see him driven from the Capitol after his oration by one of his\r\nfamily slaves.[48] Others, not wishing to be burdened with a house,\r\nlived in the hotels, where other people’s slaves waited upon them. In\r\nthese, too, the cost of living was low, the leading hostelries taking\r\nguests at $1.75 a day, $10 a week, or $35 a month. Transients sat down\r\nto tables fairly groaning with food, and with decanters of brandy and\r\nwhiskey at their elbows, free at these prices. The guest, in his room,\r\ncould order real Madeira for $3 a bottle, sherry, brandy, and gin for\r\n$1.50, and Jamaica rum for $1. The statesman, leaving his hotel quarters\r\nfor the Senate or the House, could, if he wished, pause at the bar of\r\nthe hostelry for a toddy of unadulterated liquor and lump sugar for\r\ntwelve and a half cents.[49] But the greater part of the public men\r\nlived in boarding-houses, and the “Intelligencer,” the “Globe,” and the\r\n“Telegraph” filled columns, at the beginning of congressional sessions,\r\nwith the enticing advertisements of the landladies. Some few of these\r\nhouses, such as Dawson’s, associated with celebrities, live in history,\r\nbut the majority were small, shabby, and uncomfortable. In these,\r\nhowever, romances sometimes blossomed, and the barmaid of one presided\r\nfor a time over the establishment of a Cabinet member, and the landlady\r\nof another over the household of a Senator who aspired to the\r\nPresidency.[50]\r\n\r\nOut of this life in hotels and boarding-houses, during the Jacksonian\r\nperiod, came the custom of statesmen forming themselves and families\r\ninto “messes,” each “mess” having a table to itself and contracting with\r\nthe landlady or landlord for a caterer. In this way the lawgivers were\r\nsocially grouped according to their intellectual and financial standing,\r\nand some of these “messes” were famous in their day. Friendships were\r\nformed that survived all the vicissitudes of time and political change.\r\nOne of these, known as the “Woodbury mess,” consisted of such a notable\r\ncoterie of brilliancy and genius as Calhoun, John Randolph, Tazewell,\r\nBurges, and Verplanck. About the table many celebrated measures were\r\nconceived and the strategy of many a fight was planned.[51] According to\r\nthe law of the “mess” a member might invite a guest only with the\r\nconsent of all the others, and it was understood that a failure to get\r\nunanimous consent should not be resented. Occasionally the guests were\r\npermitted to contribute something to the usual outlay. Daniel Webster\r\nwas glad enough to pay his way on such occasions. The venerable Adams,\r\nwho had a comfortable home on F Street[52] and was not considered a\r\nnotably social animal, delighted to join his most interesting colleagues\r\nat the boarding-house or hotel table. “I dined with John C. Calhoun at\r\nDawson’s,” he recorded. “Mr. Preston, the other Senator from South\r\nCarolina, and his wife were there, and Mangum, Southard, Sprague of\r\nMaine. Company sat late at table and the conversation was chiefly upon\r\npolitics. The company was, at this time, adversaries of the present\r\nAdministration--most of them were adversaries to the last.”[53] Three\r\ndays later: “Dined with Benj. Gorham and Edward Everett. Calhoun,\r\nPreston, Clay, and others were there.”[54] The next evening: “Dined with\r\nColonel Robert B. Campbell of S.C. at his lodgings at Gadsby’s”; thirty\r\npeople, including Calhoun and Preston, in attendance.[55]\r\n\r\nIt was inevitable that in a little city of twenty thousand, consisting\r\nin part of the cleverest men and women in the Republic, and devoted\r\nwholly to politics and society, celebrated sojourners should be fêted\r\nand lionized. Foreigners visiting America in the Thirties, and recording\r\ntheir impressions, have all paid tribute to the hospitality and\r\nbrilliance of the capital, as compared with other and larger cities. The\r\nmost famous of the visitors was Harriet Martineau, who arrived in the\r\nsummer of 1834, in her thirty-second year, and in the full flush of her\r\nliterary fame. Introduced to the President and the Senate leaders by the\r\nBritish Minister, it was the rumor at the time that six hundred people\r\ncalled upon her the day after her arrival.[56] “The drollest part of the\r\nwhole,” wrote a lady of fashion, “is that these crowds, at least in\r\nWashington, go to see the lion and nothing else. I have not met with an\r\nindividual, except Mrs. Seaton and her mother,[57] who have read any of\r\nher works, or know for what she is celebrated. Our most fashionable\r\nexclusive,[58] Mrs. Tayloe, said she intended to call, and asked what\r\nwere the novels she had written, and if they were pretty. The gentlemen\r\nlaugh at a woman’s writing on political economy. Not one of them has the\r\nleast idea of her work.”[59] But the fluency of the lioness captivated\r\nthe men. Among her constant visitors were Webster, Clay, Calhoun,\r\nPreston, and Justice Story. When she entered the Senate Chamber or the\r\nSupreme Court room, the leading men of the Nation left their seats to\r\npay her homage. Calhoun’s “mess” gave her a dinner. Clay insisted that\r\nat Lexington she should occupy his house at Ashland, and that she should\r\nbe the guest of his daughter in New Orleans. Calhoun assured her triumph\r\nin Charleston through letters to his friends. “No stranger except\r\nLafayette ever received such universal and marked testimonies of\r\nregard,” wrote a sympathetic observer of her reception.[60] When Thomas\r\nHamilton, the English writer, author of “Men and Manners in America,”\r\nreached Washington, a member of Congress escorted him, uninvited, to a\r\nball on the evening of his arrival, with the assurance that the\r\n“intrusion would be welcome.” After passing “through a formidable array\r\nof introductions to distinguished persons, and after four hours of\r\nalmost unbroken conversation, much of which could not be carried on\r\nwithout considerable expenditure of thought,” the weary tourist, at\r\nthree o’clock in the morning, rejoiced to find himself “stretched in a\r\ncomfortable bed at Gadsby’s.”[61] The experiences of Hamilton and Miss\r\nMartineau were not exceptional.\r\n\r\nNor were American literary celebrities left in doubt as to the\r\ncordiality of their welcome in the best social circles of the capital.\r\nThe winter of 1833 found Washington Irving in Washington, where he was\r\nnot unfamiliar with the leading houses, living “in the neighborhood of\r\nthe McLanes” and making “use of a quiet corner and a little interval of\r\nleisure to exercise a long neglected pen.”[62] Despite the flood of\r\ninvitations, he found time to report to Van Buren the attitude of\r\nMcLane, and the hostilities, in select circles, to Kendall. “Washington\r\nIrving is here now,” wrote John Tyler to his daughter. “He stands at the\r\nhead of our literati. His productions are numerous and well spoken of in\r\nEurope.”[63] Nor did society in those days lack their chronicler, for\r\nthe first society letters from Washington were those of Nathaniel P.\r\nWillis written for the “New York Mirror.” At that time he was “a\r\nfoppish, slender young man, with a profusion of curly light hair, and\r\nwas always dressed in the height of fashion.”[64] The doors of the most\r\nexclusive homes were thrown open to this elegant youth, who, having\r\ntraveled in Europe, affected a contempt for the masses. He became the\r\nfaithful Pepys of the period, describing society people and events with\r\nliveliness and fancy, and imparting a strange interest to the most\r\ninsignificant occurrences through the art of the telling. It was during\r\nthis period, too, that the political letters of Washington\r\ncorrespondents were introduced into American journalism. Matthew L.\r\nDavis, famous as the “Genevese Traveller” of the London “Times,” and as\r\nthe capital correspondent of the “New York Courier and Enquirer,” was\r\nfor years the confidant and companion of Senators, Justices, and\r\nPresidents. And James Gordon Bennett, young and clever, appeared upon\r\nthe scene to give a new and spicy touch to reporting with his Walpolean\r\nletters of wit, sarcasm, and personalities, for the New York paper of\r\nJames Watson Webb. Along with the democratization of politics in the\r\nThirties went a popularization of the methods of the press.\r\n\r\nThe amusements of the Washington of this time were, for the most part,\r\ncrude. The theater featured players scarcely celebrated in their own\r\nday, and most of the plays presented have happily been long since\r\nforgotten. Even these were interspersed with songs and farce acts. In\r\n1820 the Washington Theater had been built, and hither, at long\r\nintervals, came celebrated artists, but they came “like angels, few and\r\nfar between.” From his rustic retreat in Maryland the elder Booth, half\r\nmad, all genius, occasionally emerged to curdle the blood of the\r\nstatesmen and their families with his intense interpretations of the\r\nShakesperian tragedies. From a Booth night Jackson was seldom absent.\r\nBut of all the artists who played in the capital none created such a\r\nfuror as Fanny Kemble. The elder statesmen were captivated by her art\r\nand charm. John Marshall and Justice Story were regular attendants, and\r\nthe Chief Justice was lustily cheered as he entered the box. When she\r\nplayed Mrs. Haller in “The Stranger,” and the audience was moved to\r\ntears, “the Chief Justice shed them in common with the younger\r\neyes.”[65] Inspiring audiences--those of the Thirties, with Marshall,\r\nJackson, Webster, Clay, and Calhoun in the boxes or the pit. Great, not\r\nonly in genius, but in their fresh capacity to enjoy, and when one of\r\nthe most learned Justices of the Supreme Court could be moved to poesy\r\nin paying tribute to an actress’s art.[66]\r\n\r\nBut even with a Kemble playing, the haughty little country capital\r\nrefused to abandon its parties, and we have the record of a New Yorker\r\nfinding “Fanny Kemble in the Washington Theater like a canary bird in a\r\nmouse trap,” leaving the theater in the midst of a performance to attend\r\n“a delightful party at Mrs. Tayloe’s,” where he “met many distinguished\r\npeople and all the Washington belles.”[67] In those days the\r\ntheater-goer purchased his tickets between ten and one o’clock, and the\r\ndoors were thrown open at six, with the curtain rising promptly at\r\nseven. For the usual performances the boxes were seventy-five cents, the\r\npit twenty-five. When the rain converted the streets into ribbons of\r\nsticky black mud, or the bitter cold made an invitation to the people\r\nfrom the “magnificent distances” unprofitable, the papers would announce\r\na postponement, with an explanation.[68] The pleasure-seekers were not\r\nrestricted, however, to the players of the Washington Theater, and\r\noccasionally a show would appear advertising “the Great Anaconda of\r\nJava,” and the “Boa Constrictor of Ceylon,” both “so docile that the\r\nmost timid lady or child may view them with safety and pleasure.”[69]\r\nSuch were the amusements offered for the entertainment of Jackson,\r\nWebster, Marshall, Calhoun, and Clay.\r\n\r\nBut for the men there were other forms of amusement, popular in their\r\nday. The racing on the National Course near the city made it difficult\r\nto maintain a quorum in Congress, and the statesmen mounted their horses\r\nto ride to the track to cheer their favorites and to bet their money.\r\nEven the President entered his horses and lost heavily on his wagers.\r\nThere Jackson and a goodly portion of the Cabinet, and a formidable\r\nsprinkling of the leaders of the Opposition from Clay to Letcher, might\r\nbe seen backing their judgment as to horseflesh with their purses. And\r\nwhen it was not horse-racing, it was cockfighting, with the President\r\nentering his own birds from the Hermitage, and riding with his friends\r\nto Bladensburg to witness the humiliation of his entries. It was a day\r\nof gambling, when statesmen, whose names children are now taught to\r\nreverence, played for heavy stakes for days and nights at a time, with\r\nClay and Poindexter losing fortunes, and an occasional victim of the\r\nlure blowing out his brains. While most of the celebrities played in\r\nprivate houses, they could, if they preferred, find the notorious\r\ngambling-houses along the Avenue. Along with racing, cockfighting, and\r\ngambling went heavy drinking. “Since I have been here,” wrote Horace\r\nBinney, after two years in Congress, “one man, an habitual drunkard,\r\nblew out his brains; two have died notorious drunkards, and one of them\r\nshamefully immoral. The honors are given to all, with equal eulogy and\r\nceremonial.”[70] The statesman of the Thirties who did not drink heavily\r\nwas a rarity. Just as whiskey, brandy, gin, and wine were served in\r\ngreat decanters on the tables at hotels, “at the boarding-houses every\r\nguest had his bottle or interest in a bottle.”[71] On the way to the\r\nCapitol, the statesman could quench his thirst at numerous bars--and\r\noften did. And in the basement of the Capitol building whiskey could be\r\nhad. Never in American history have so many promising careers been\r\nwrecked by drunkenness as during the third decade. Frequently national\r\ncelebrities would appear upon the floor of the House or Senate in a\r\nstate of intoxication, and on at least one occasion the greater part of\r\nthe house was hilariously drunk.[72] Thus, despite the miry streets, the\r\ndrabness and rusticity, the Washington of the Jacksonian period was\r\neasily the gayest, the most brilliant and dissipated community in the\r\ncountry. A penetrating observer found, in its recklessness and\r\nextravagance, a striking similarity to the spirit of the eighteenth\r\ncentury in England, as portrayed in Thackeray’s “Humorists,” with\r\n“laxity of morals and the coolest disregard possible.”[73] Its superior\r\nsocial charm was due to the fact that it was “the only place in the\r\nUnion where people consider it necessary to be agreeable--where\r\npleasing, as in the Old World, becomes a sort of business, and the\r\nenjoyments of social intercourse enter into the habitual calculations of\r\nevery one.”[74] A goodly portion of the women of good society, and other\r\nsojourners, were apt to contemplate a Washington season as “a sort of\r\nannual lark,” which offered the most promising solution of the problem\r\nof a weary winter in the country. Willis explained the attractions of\r\nthe country capital on the ground that “the great deficiency in all our\r\ncities, the company of highly cultivated and superior men, is here\r\nsupplied.”[75] Even the supercilious and scolding Captain Marryat of\r\nEngland found it “an agreeable city, full of pleasant, clever people,\r\nwho come here to amuse and be amused,” and he observed “much more _usage\r\ndu monde_ and Continental ease than in any other parts of the\r\nStates.”[76]\r\n\r\nAfter spending several crowded weeks in the social and political heart\r\nof the town, Harriet Martineau concluded that, while life there would be\r\n“dreary” to women who loved domesticity, “persons who love dissipation,\r\nwho love to watch the game of politics, and those who make a study of\r\nstrong minds under strong excitement, like a season in Washington.”[77]\r\nLudicrous as it was in its incongruities, the little city bravely\r\nassumed the pose of a real capital, plumed itself on the superiority of\r\nits society, and made much of the fashions. At the crowded receptions\r\nthe wondering visitor might very easily be jostled against Webster or\r\nSam Houston, dandies like Willis or frontiersmen in boots and soiled\r\nlinen, flirtatious belles and matrons, beauties and beasts. But there\r\nwere many leaders of fashion who imitated the frivolities of European\r\ncapitals, ordered their dresses from Paris or London, and regularly\r\nsummoned coiffeurs to their homes to dress their hair for balls and\r\nreceptions.[78] When Congress was in session fashionable women from\r\nevery section flocked to the seat of government bringing their daughters\r\nfor a Washington season. One of the resident society leaders, commenting\r\non their coming, dolefully complained that they were “coming in such ton\r\nand expensive fashions, that the poor citizens cannot pretend to vie\r\nwith them and absolutely shrink into insignificance.”[79] The shops made\r\nmuch of their Paris finery. Mrs. Coursault announced “to the ladies of\r\nthe metropolis that she has just returned from Paris with a most\r\nsplendid assortment of millinery and goods, to be seen at the store of\r\nMrs. Lamplier on the Avenue.”[80] Mr. Palmieri advertised that he had\r\n“just received from Paris an elegant assortment of caps and pelerines\r\ndirect from Mademoiselle Minette’s, the first Milliner of Paris, and a\r\nbeautiful assortment of satin shoes.”[81] Another announced “French\r\ndresses for balls,” and still another, “the arrival from Paris of an\r\nelegant assortment of French jewelry.”\r\n\r\nThe daily life of the fashionable ladies of the time began with\r\nbreakfast at nine, when they amused themselves by comparing the\r\nconflicting descriptions of scenes they had witnessed the day before in\r\nthe “Intelligencer” and the “Globe.” By eleven they were apt to be on\r\ntheir way to the Capitol to enliven the solemnity of the Senate Chamber\r\nor the Supreme Court, unless a neglected call, an appointment with an\r\nartist, or an excursion interfered. Dinner was served from four to six,\r\nand soon afterwards milady retired to her boudoir to dress for some\r\nball, rout, levee, or masquerade. Long drives through the mud--late\r\nhours with the breaking dawn greeting her return--and the weary lady\r\nwould relax and warm awhile at the drawing-room fire before retiring for\r\nthe night.[82] Contrary to the popular belief, there was much social\r\nbrilliance during the Jackson Administrations. Nor is the prevailing\r\nimpression that all the elegance, cleverness, and charm was confined to\r\nthe drawing-rooms of the Whig aristocracy borne out by the facts. In\r\ntruth, among the women of the Jacksonian circle there were two or three\r\nwho were easily superior to the best the Whigs could offer, in\r\nintellect, culture, and beauty. Such was the bigotry of the times that\r\nthere was a tendency for society to segregate into camps, but it was\r\nimpossible to draw the party line on a number of the fascinating and\r\nbrilliant women who presided over the households of Jacksonian Senators\r\nand Cabinet Ministers. While the Whigs generally remained severely aloof\r\nfrom the house of the President, they were unable to resist the\r\ninvitations of the President’s friends.\r\n\r\nAmong all the women of the period none approached Mrs. Edward Livingston\r\nin brilliance, charm, and elegance, nor did any of the ladies of the\r\nWhig circle, not even Mrs. Tayloe, who wondered if Miss Martineau’s\r\nnovels were “pretty,” approach her in the lavishness and taste of her\r\ndinners and parties. “Mrs. Livingston takes the lead in the fashionable\r\nworld,” wrote Mrs. Smith, who found it hard to concede the virtues of\r\nthe Jacksonians.[83] “I know that Mr. Livingston gives elegant dinners\r\nand his wines are the best in the city,” recorded a press correspondent\r\nof the time.[84] “We dined by invitation with Mr. Secretary Livingston,”\r\nwrote Justice Story, an enemy of the Jacksonians. “The dinner was superb\r\nand unequalled by anything I have seen in Washington except at some of\r\nthe foreign ministers’, and was served exclusively in the French\r\nstyle.”[85] This captivating woman, of French descent, had known a\r\nchildhood of romance in a marble palace by the sea in St. Domingo, had\r\nmiraculously escaped the servile insurrection, and reached New Orleans\r\nto become the wife of Livingston. Wonderfully vivacious, eloquent in\r\nconversation, intelligently interested in politics, steeped in the\r\nliterature of the ages, witty and spirited, her home in Lafayette Square\r\nmore nearly resembled a salon than anything the capital has ever known.\r\nEven the most bigoted Whigs of the day were glad to lay aside their\r\npartisanship at her threshold, and leaders, still flushed with a verbal\r\nduel in the Senate, smiled amicably upon each other in her drawing-room.\r\nHere one might meet John Marshall, Joseph Story, and Bushrod Washington\r\nof the Supreme Court, Webster, Clay, Calhoun, Wirt, or Randolph. About\r\nher, too, she gathered a coterie of cultured women, and Mrs. John Quincy\r\nAdams and Mrs. Andrew Stevenson came and went in the house on the Square\r\nwith as little ceremony as members of the household. The charm of the\r\nhouse was enhanced by the exquisite Cora, the daughter, who reigned as\r\nthe belle and toast of the town until her marriage, captivating, among\r\nothers, the impressionable young Josiah Quincy, who thought her\r\n“undoubtedly the greatest belle in the U.S.,” and, if not\r\n“transcendently handsome,” possessed of a “fine figure, a pretty face.”\r\nFinding it “the height of the ton to be her admirer,” the young\r\nBostonian followed the fashion with all his heart.[86]\r\n\r\nIntimately identified with Mrs. Livingston was Mrs. Stevenson, to whom\r\nthe years had been kind since the days when, as Sally Coles, she was a\r\nprotégée of Dolly Madison.[87] At this time she was the wife of the\r\nJacksonian Speaker of the House, soon to become the hostess of the\r\nAmerican Legation in London, and to witness, in that rôle, the\r\ncoronation of Victoria. Strikingly handsome, tall and commanding, she\r\nresembled her friend in an ineffable graciousness of manner and an\r\nextraordinary conversational ability. Among the most famous hostesses of\r\nthe Jacksonian circle were Mrs. Louis McLane, “a gay, frank,\r\ncommunicative woman” whose “self-complacence is united with so much good\r\nhumor in others that it is not offensive,” who gave popular weekly\r\ndinners and parties;[88] Mrs. Levi Woodbury, beautiful of form and\r\nfeature, who resembled Dolly Madison in her suavity, ease of manner, and\r\ninfinite tact, and presided over her many dinners and dances with\r\ndignity and grace, and made a practice of featuring the most dashing\r\nbelles of Baltimore, Alexandria, and Georgetown;[89] and Mrs. John\r\nForsyth, more conventional and retiring than the others, but yielding to\r\nnone in culture and elegance, and having a certain advantage in her\r\n“group of graces.”[90] Among the hostesses of the Opposition, Mrs.\r\nBenjamin Ogle Tayloe, a woman of grace and beauty, but lacking in the\r\nintellectual sparkle of Mrs. Livingston, maintained the most elegant\r\nestablishment.\r\n\r\nBut these were only the most brilliant leaders, for the Jacksonian\r\nperiod was one of hectic social activity, with foreign ministers and\r\nCabinet members entertaining constantly and lavishly, and the official\r\nunderlings desperately bent on a ruinous and riotous imitation. It was a\r\nday of much pretense and pose, of ceremonious intercourse, and it was\r\nnot easy to determine from the swallow-tails and the buff waistcoats\r\nwhether the wearer were a Senator or a clerk.[91] It was a\r\nconversational period, and seldom has the American capital contained at\r\none time so many excellent talkers. Nor was the talk mere chat and\r\ngossip. Even the women, especially from the South, were clever\r\nconversationalists, able keenly to discuss the politics of the day and\r\nthe measures of the hour.[92] Even the busiest and greatest party\r\nleaders had the time and inclination for calls on bright women when they\r\ncould enjoy the Johnsonian luxury of having their talk out. We have a\r\npicture of Clay “sitting upright on the sofa, with a snuff box ever in\r\nhis hand,” discoursing “for many hours in his even, soft, deliberative\r\ntone”; of Webster, “leaning back at his ease, telling stories, cracking\r\njokes, shaking the sofa with burst after burst of laughter, or smoothly\r\ndiscoursing to the perfect felicity of the logical part of one’s\r\nconstitution”; of Calhoun, the “cast iron man,” who “looked as if he had\r\nnever been born,” no longer capable of mental relaxation, meeting men\r\nand haranguing them by the fireside as in the Senate; of Justice Story,\r\ntalking gushingly for hours, “his face all the while, notwithstanding\r\nhis gray hair, showing all the nobility and ingenuousness of a\r\nchild’s.”[93] The talk about the firesides and at the receptions, that\r\nwere given over entirely to conversation, was by no means confined to\r\nart, eloquence, and poetry, for the Mother Grundys of gossip were\r\nnumerous among the women seeking to amuse and be amused. There were\r\npersonalities as well as personages in the years that Jackson directed a\r\ntriumphant party and Clay led a brilliant and militant opposition.[94]\r\nThe little town of twenty thousand was not so large that the ladies\r\ncould not know, from observation or deduction, when Adams dined with\r\nCalhoun, when Webster called on Mrs. Livingston, and what Mrs. Tayloe\r\nserved her guests at her last reception.\r\n\r\n“Did you have candied oranges at Mrs. Woodbury’s?” asked a lady who had\r\ndined with Mrs. Cass, of a friend who had dined with the wife of the\r\nSecretary of the Navy.\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Then they had candied oranges at the Attorney-General’s,” was the\r\ndeduction.\r\n\r\n“How do you know?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, as we were on the way, I saw a dish carried; and as we had none at\r\nCass’s, I knew they were either for the Woodburys or the\r\nAttorney-General’s.”[95]\r\n\r\nIt was the golden age of gallantry as well as gossip, some flirtatious,\r\nsome courtly. If the admirer of John Forsyth’s daughter proposed in a\r\nValentine Day verse[96] throbbing with adolescent passion, the more\r\nstaid and sober-minded Francis Scott Key wrote, in a fine hand,\r\nreligious hymns for the pleasure of her mother.[97]\r\n\r\nThe evening parties were the most popular form of entertainment, and the\r\nhostesses of the Cabinet circle set the pace. The invitations were sent\r\nout nine days in advance. Because of the exigencies of politics, and\r\nthe exactions of an awakened “Democracy,” these could be neither small\r\nnor exclusive in character, and from seven to nine hundred invitations\r\nwere usually extended. Between nine and ten o’clock all the apartments\r\nwould be thrown open. The muddy streets in front would be congested with\r\ncarriages. The host and hostess, standing in the drawing-room, would\r\nreceive their guests, and then the more serious would withdraw to quiet\r\ncorners for conversation, the gay and frivolous would swing into the\r\ndance, and the devotees of chance would seek and find a remote corner\r\nfor cards. Servants would gingerly thread their way through the throng\r\nwith light refreshments until eleven o’clock when an elaborate supper\r\nwould be served. By three o’clock the company would begin to retire, and\r\nusually, at daybreak, the lights would be extinguished.[98]\r\n\r\nIt was a day of social novelties. Ice-cream as a refreshment first made\r\nits appearance in the country capital at the home of the widow of\r\nAlexander Hamilton. Introduced at the White House immediately afterwards\r\nby Jackson, it took society by storm,[99] and Kinchy, the confectioner\r\non the Avenue, who had a monopoly on ice-cream and ices, became as\r\nindispensable socially as the chef and the fiddler.[100] Of the dances,\r\nthe most popular was the waltz, introduced two years before Jackson’s\r\ninauguration, and, considered at first of questionable modesty, it soon\r\nwon its way, and the matrons found it as alluring as the débutantes.\r\nEven then there were censorious people to see in the dreamy glide an\r\nexample of the moral degeneracy of the age.[101] To accentuate their\r\npessimism, the crowds were invariably so dense that the dancers could\r\nscarcely move, reminding an amused Kentuckian “of a Kentucky fight when\r\nthe crowd draws the circle so close that the combatants have no room to\r\nuse their limbs.” But despite the crowded quarters, the twenty-four\r\nfiddlers in a row bravely sought “by dint of loud music to put the\r\namateurs in motion,” until they jumped “up and down in a hole, and\r\nnobody sees more of them than their heads.”[102] Queer, conglomerate\r\ncrowds packed the balls and receptions of men in public life, forced to\r\naccept official society as they found it, and if members of Congress\r\nappeared at the dance in their morning habiliments and in unpolished\r\nboots, in worsted stockings and in garments fashioned by a backwoods\r\ntailor, they were not conspicuous.[103] All, or most, entered with zest\r\ninto the social activities of the time. On the night of a big ball “the\r\nrolling of carriages sounded like continual peals of thunder, or roaring\r\nof the wind.” In the dark, dismal streets, the lamps on the vehicles\r\nalone were visible, and these, moving rapidly in the blackness,\r\n“appeared like brilliant meteors in the air.”[104] Sometimes, in the\r\ncase of the more pretentious entertainers, like the foreign ministers,\r\nthe streets in front of the houses were light as day from the line of\r\nflaming torches along the pavement. Fox, the British Minister, a\r\nrelative of the great orator; Baron von Roenne, the Prussian, a\r\nbrilliant jurist and publicist; and Baron Bodisco, the Russian, made\r\ngreat displays of equipages and appointments, and were noted for their\r\nwines and exotic entertainments. At the legations of Fox and Bodisco,\r\ngreat sums passed over the card table, the most famous statesmen of the\r\ntime among the players, and the British Minister so seldom saw the sun\r\nthat on the occasion of a funeral, while seated beside the wife of the\r\nSpanish Minister, he turned a puzzled look upon her with the comment,\r\n“How strange we all look by daylight!” Both ministers contributed not a\r\nlittle to the gayety of gossip, Bodisco, by his squat ugliness and\r\ncourtliness, and Fox, by his whimsical refusal at dinners to go to the\r\ntable until the dishes had cooled.[105] During the period the most\r\ncelebrated functions were given at Carusi’s Assembly rooms which could\r\naccommodate great numbers. Leaders of fashion and the socially ambitious\r\nof Baltimore and Alexandria, wishing to make an impression in\r\nintroducing a débutante or to repay social obligations, found these\r\nrooms suited to their purpose. It was in these rooms that Washington\r\nsociety had its first presentation of the “Barber of Seville,” and “John\r\nof Paris” in the winter of 1833.[106] The same year a Washington\r\nbirthday party was given there, both rooms thrown open, “decorated and\r\nilluminated and with a band in each,” and diplomats admitted without an\r\nentrance fee.[107] Hither all the ladies of the capital, unfamiliar with\r\nthe dances, or wishing to learn new ones, found their way to learn from\r\nthe popular Louis, only the inclemency of the weather and the impossible\r\nmire of the streets interfering with his profits.[108] Thus the\r\nfashionables of the Thirties managed to create the illusion of living in\r\nthe great world, chattering in the Senate, bustling into the Supreme\r\nCourt chamber, dining, dancing, flirting, gossiping, attending the\r\ntheater to see a Booth or a Kemble, going to the circus to see the\r\nanimals fed at eight o’clock, “in the presence of the audience,”[109] or\r\nriding to the National Course near town to witness the races, or\r\nattending an exhibit of the paintings of John G. Chapman on the\r\nAvenue.[110] Only on Sundays did the capital become quiet and sedate,\r\nfor, after a pious morning pilgrimage to church, the ladies carrying a\r\nhymn or a prayer book and leaning on the arms of their escorts, they\r\nretired to the seclusion of their homes and the streets were deserted or\r\ngiven over to the promenades of the colored folks.[111]\r\n\r\nIn this Washington, where men were feverishly fighting for place and\r\nprestige, and women were engaged in a hectic struggle for social\r\nleadership, Death lurked always, for a less healthful spot could not\r\neasily have been found. Built originally in a swamp reeking with\r\nmalaria, surrounded with morasses, and with not a few of these in the\r\nheart of the town, with sanitation poor and water wretched, the\r\nresidents were constantly menaced by disease. With the gradual\r\ndisappearance of the forests immediately surrounding it, the conditions\r\nbecame worse. The death-rate was as high as one in fifty-three, with\r\nAugust claiming the heaviest toll from fevers.[112] Between the fevers\r\nof the summers and the influenza of the winters, the residents had to be\r\nconstantly on guard. Whiskey and quinine were taken with the regularity\r\nof bread and meat, and tourists were wont to sit late at their quarters\r\n“sipping gently a medicine which the doctors of the capital thought\r\ndestructive of the influenza germs which were lying in wait for the\r\nunwary.”[113] Fevers, pneumonia, influenza, and the cholera made the\r\nswampy capital of the Thirties as profitable to the doctors as to the\r\ncoachmen.\r\n\r\nSuch, in brief, was the scene of the most dramatic and significant\r\npolitical battles that were staged in America between the foundation of\r\nthe Republic and the Administration of Woodrow Wilson. Such was the\r\nday-by-day life of the men, now steel engravings, who played the\r\nleading rôles. And by bearing in mind the sordidness and pettiness of\r\nthe environment, and of the men and women with whom they daily and\r\nnightly gossiped and dined and danced, it may be less of a shock to\r\ndiscover, in the unfolding of the story of these eight crowded years,\r\nthat even the greatest were men of moral weaknesses and limitations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE RISING OF THE MASSES\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nWith the election of 1828 a new era dawned in American politics. Up to\r\nthis time the election of Presidents and the determination of policies\r\nhad been a matter of manipulation among the congressional politicians.\r\nThe possessors of property and the aristocrats of intellect had been the\r\nonly classes with whom the politicians had concerned themselves. The\r\nVirginia Dynasty and the Secretarial Succession died on the day that the\r\nrising of the masses raised to the Presidency a man who had never served\r\nin the Cabinet, distinguished himself in the Congress, or appealed to\r\nthe “aristocracy of intellect and culture.” To the politicians,\r\noffice-holders, and society leaders in Washington, the election of\r\nAndrew Jackson was something more than a shock--it was an affront. In\r\nthe campaign he had been opposed by two thirds of the newspapers, four\r\nfifths of the preachers, practically all the manufacturers, and seven\r\neighths of the banking capital. Respectability sternly set itself\r\nagainst the presumptuous ambitions of what it conceived to be a rough,\r\nilliterate representative of the “mob.”\r\n\r\nFour years before, the stage had been set for a bitter battle. The\r\nelection of Adams, through the support of Clay, followed by the\r\nappointment of the latter to the first place in the Cabinet, had carried\r\nthe suspicion of a bargain, and this suspicion had crystallized into a\r\nfirm conviction with a large portion of the people. Throughout the Adams\r\nAdministration, its enemies--and they were legion--harped constantly\r\nupon the “bargain,” angering the crabbed Adams, and stinging Clay to\r\nfurious denunciation, and this but served to intensify the bitterness of\r\ntheir foes.\r\n\r\nThe result was the most scurrilous campaign of vilification the country\r\nhad known. A new school of politicians, forerunners of the astute and\r\nnone too scrupulous managers of later days, sprang up to direct the\r\nfight for the grim old warrior of the Hermitage, and the fact that Clay\r\ntook personal charge of the campaign for Adams was turned with telling\r\nforce against his chief. Early in the campaign we find the satirical and\r\ncaustic Isaac Hill, of the “New Hampshire Patriot,” of whom we shall\r\nhear much, writing that “Clay is managing Adams’s campaign, not like a\r\nstatesman of the Cabinet, but like a shyster, pettifogging in a bastard\r\nsuit before a country squire.” And lest the motive for Clay’s interest\r\nescape his readers, we find Hill writing again: “This is Mr. Clay’s\r\nfight. The country has him on trial for bribery, and having no defense,\r\nhe accuses the prosecutor.”\r\n\r\nThis reference to the accusation of the prosecutor was inspired by the\r\noutrageous calumny that was heaped upon the head of Jackson. He was\r\npictured as a usurper, an adulterer, a gambler, a cockfighter, a\r\nbrawler, a drunkard, and a murderer. The good name of Mrs. Jackson, one\r\nof the purest of women, was wantonly maligned; and in the drawing-rooms\r\nof the intellectually elect she was not spared by the ladies who were\r\nshocked at the “vulgarity” of her husband. The Adams organs stooped to\r\nthe attack, and while the “National Intelligencer,” under the editorship\r\nof Joseph Gales, refused thus to pollute its columns, the “National\r\nJournal,” under the editorial management of Peter Force, and specially\r\nfavored by the Adams Administration, specialized on the slander of an\r\nexcellent woman. A little later an attempt was made to justify the\r\ninfamy of this proceeding by charging that Mrs. Adams had been assailed,\r\nbut the extent of the assault was the charge that she was an English\r\nwoman with little sympathy for American institutions.\r\n\r\nWhile history has accepted Adams’s indignant denial of the charge that\r\nhe had personally sanctioned the attack on Mrs. Jackson, the National\r\nCentral Committee, in charge of his campaign, was busily engaged in the\r\ndissemination of the putrid literature. This has been thoroughly\r\nestablished by the testimony of Thurlow Weed, editor of the “Albany\r\nJournal,” who refused to degrade himself by its circulation. When, early\r\nin August, before the election in November, he received “two large\r\ndrygoods boxes” of the pamphlets, with a letter from the National\r\nCommittee advising him that they contained “valuable campaign\r\ndocuments,” with the request that he attend to their circulation\r\n“throughout the western counties of the State,” he promptly “secured the\r\nboxes with additional nails and placed them under lock and key.” And\r\nwhen the National Committee learned that they were not being\r\ndistributed, and sent a representative to protest against his\r\ninactivity, he frankly informed the emissary that “not a copy had been\r\nseen or would be seen by an elector until the polls had closed.” For\r\nthis he was denounced in New York and Boston as “a traitor to the\r\nAdministration,” but the sagacious politician of Albany stoutly\r\nmaintained that he “would not permit a lady whose life had been\r\nblameless to be dragged forth into the arena of politics.”[114]\r\n\r\nThe charge of murder lodged against Jackson, by editor, hack-writer, and\r\ncartoonist, had reference to his execution of Arbuthnot, two Indian\r\nchiefs, and seven of his soldiers, and to his duel with Dickinson.\r\nPictures of the coffins of the soldiers were printed on circulars and\r\ndistributed from farmhouse to farmhouse in New England.[115] This gave\r\nHill an opportunity to tickle Jackson with a rejoinder which was copied\r\nfrom the “New Hampshire Patriot” into all the Jackson papers of the\r\ncountry: “Pshaw! Why don’t you tell the whole truth? On the 8th of\r\nJanuary, 1815, he murdered in the coldest kind of cold blood 1500\r\nBritish soldiers for merely trying to get into New Orleans in search of\r\nBooty and Beauty.”\r\n\r\nBut all the scurrility of the campaign cannot be justly charged to the\r\nenemies of Jackson. His friends were almost as offensive. Adams had\r\nbribed Clay. He had bought the Presidency. While abroad he had pandered\r\nto the sensuality of the Russian Court. He was stingy, undemocratic, an\r\nenemy of American institutions, bent on the destruction of the people’s\r\nliberties. He was an aristocrat, and had squandered the people’s money\r\nin lavishly furnishing the East Room of the White House after the\r\nfashion of the homes of kings. He had even purchased a billiard table\r\nfor the home of the President!\r\n\r\nAnd so it went on for weeks and months--the ordinary slanders of a\r\npresent-day municipal campaign. A foreigner traveling through the\r\ncountry during the summer and autumn of 1828 would have thought the\r\nelection of Adams certain. In the marts, the counting-rooms, and the\r\ndrawing-rooms, he would have found but one opinion; but the astute Adams\r\nsensed the coming disaster and recorded his misgivings in his diary. The\r\ntemperamental Clay was depressed one day, to be exultant the next. But\r\nthe new school of political leadership, managing the fight for Jackson,\r\nand devoting itself assiduously to the newly enfranchised “mob” in the\r\nhighways and the byways, had no notion of defeat. The “hurrah for\r\nJackson” which shocked the sedate, unaccustomed to such noisy acclaim of\r\na presidential aspirant, and disgusted the “best people,” was music to\r\nthe ears of these modern politicians, who had carefully calculated upon\r\nthe strength of the “mob.” Their confidence was not misplaced. The\r\nresult was an upheaval. Adams, Clay, Federalism, the Virginia Dynasty,\r\nthe Secretarial Succession, were brushed aside by the rush of the\r\ncheering masses bearing their hero to the White House. History has\r\ndecided that in this campaign “the people first assumed control of the\r\ngovernmental machinery which had been held in trust for them since\r\n1789”; and that “the party and Administration which then came into power\r\nwas the first in our history which represented the people without\r\nrestriction, and with all the faults of the people.”[116]\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe Administration circle in Washington was deeply depressed by the\r\nresult, and society looked forward to the reign of the barbarians with\r\nmingled feelings of mirth and abhorrence. Although not unprepared for\r\nthe defeat, the bitter Adams, meditating on his political blunders,\r\nrecorded that “some think I have suffered for not turning my enemies out\r\nof office, particularly the Postmaster-General.”[117] That John McLean,\r\nthe official referred to, had been disloyal to his chief was common\r\nknowledge. The first reaction to defeat from the followers of the Adams\r\nAdministration was toward laughter, levity, extravagant manifestation of\r\ncynical gayety, with an all too noticeable thawing of the frigidity of\r\nWhite House ceremonies. The dying régime put on its best bib and tucker\r\nin a hectic and hysterical demonstration of social hilarity. But this\r\nfirst reaction was short-lived. Very soon thereafter callers at Clay’s\r\nhome were “shocked at the alteration of his looks,” and found him “much\r\nthinner, very pale, his eyes sunk in his head and his countenance sad\r\nand melancholy.”[118] Mr. Rush (Secretary of the Treasury) was soon\r\n“alarmingly ill”--the “first symptoms of disease was altogether in the\r\nhead.” Mr. Southard (Secretary of the Navy) was confined to his room for\r\nthree weeks. William Wirt (Attorney-General) suffered two attacks of\r\nvertigo, “followed by a loss of the sense of motion.” General Porter\r\n(Secretary of War) “was almost blind from inflammation of the eyes and\r\nwent to his office with two blisters, one behind each ear.” Even the\r\ncold-blooded Adams, who appeared “in fine spirits,” was soon “so feeble\r\nas to be obliged to relinquish his long walks and to substitute rides on\r\nhorseback.”[119] A social intimate of the leaders swept from power by\r\nthe rising of the masses mournfully recorded that they would retire to\r\nprivate life “with blasted hopes, injured health, impaired or ruined\r\nfortunes, imbittered tempers, and probably a total inability to enjoy\r\nthe remnant of their lives.”[120]\r\n\r\nOn none did the blow fall with such crushing force as on the\r\nproud-spirited Clay. As the repudiated régime was approaching the end,\r\nthe presiding genius of one of the favorite Administration drawing-rooms\r\nmet him at a reception.\r\n\r\n“What ails your heart?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Can it be otherwise than sad when I think what a good friend I am about\r\nto lose?”\r\n\r\nFor a moment he held her hand without speaking, his eyes “filled with\r\ntears.”\r\n\r\n“We must not think of this or talk of such things now,” he said. And\r\nwith that he relinquished her hand, “drew out his handkerchief, turned\r\naway his head and wiped his eyes, then pushed into the crowd and talked\r\nand smiled as if his heart were light and easy.”[121]\r\n\r\nOn February 25th this lady made another poignant note: “Mr. Clay’s\r\nfurniture is to be sold this week.”\r\n\r\nThus the old régime died hard, and in bitterness.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nBut “The King is dead--long live the King”--was the mood of the strange\r\ncrowds in the streets of the capital--unusual creatures from the\r\nout-of-the-way places to whom the city was not accustomed. Never before\r\nhad the inaugural ceremonies attracted the people of the farms and the\r\nvillages, from every nook and corner. Long before the 4th of March the\r\ncity swarmed with all sorts and conditions, the rustic, the rural\r\npolitician, the adventurer, along with politicians of influence and\r\nrepute. They overflowed the city, filled all the hotels and\r\nrooming-houses, spread out to Georgetown, descended on Alexandria.[122]\r\nWebster, writing to his brother toward the close of February, said: “I\r\nhave never seen such a crowd before. Persons have come five hundred\r\nmiles to see General Jackson, and they really seem to think that the\r\ncountry has been rescued from some dreadful danger.”[123] What they\r\nreally thought was that they had come into their own. They hastened to\r\n“their capital,” to witness the inauguration of “their President,” and,\r\nin many instances, in the hope of entering into their reward.\r\n\r\nOut of the maze of incomprehensible contradictions, we may gather that\r\nJackson disappointed many of the faithful, who had planned a spectacular\r\nentrance to the capital, by entering quietly and unannounced in the\r\nearly morning. Elaborate preparations had been made, a pompous reception\r\ncommittee of the socially elect and politically pure had been organized,\r\nheaded by John P. Van Ness, the dean of society and husband of the\r\nexquisite Marcia Burns, and plans had been perfected for leading a great\r\nthrong into the country to meet and escort him to the accompaniment of\r\ngun fire into the city. Reaching the capital four hours before he was\r\nexpected,[124] he went directly to Gadsby’s where he took lodging.[125]\r\n\r\nBut the committee was not to be wholly deprived of its prerogatives. The\r\nmoment the news reached it and the crowds, the celebration began. “I\r\nhear cannon firing, drums beating, and hurrahing. I really cannot write,\r\nso adieu for the present,” wrote Mrs. Smith. The mob surged down the\r\nAvenue to the hostelry famous for its whiskey, brandy, game, and the\r\nimposing ceremony of the host, packed the streets and fought for the\r\nprivilege of entering and shaking the hand of the man of the hour. From\r\nthe moment of his arrival until he took the oath of office he was\r\naccessible to the most humble and obscure. Importuned and petitioned by\r\nambitious politicians, the old man courteously heard them all, to the\r\nlast man, and, according to all contemporaries, kept his own counsel as\r\nto prospective appointments. Even as late as March 2d, the observant\r\nWebster wrote his brother that the President-to-be was close-mouthed,\r\nand predicted that there would be few removals.[126] The crafty Isaac\r\nHill, of the “New Hampshire Patriot,” had arrived early upon the scene,\r\nand we are indebted to him for a side-light on Jackson’s methods and\r\nmood, and the scenes about the hotel. Almost daily this persistent\r\naspirant for place wormed his way into the presence of the source of all\r\npatronage. Jackson was cordial, remembered, quoted, laughed about\r\nwitticisms in Hill’s paper during the campaign, but said “little about\r\nthe future except in a general way.” There was cruel hilarity in that\r\ncrowded room at Gadsby’s over the maneuvers of the office-holders to\r\nretain their places. A “funny story” was told of Wirt writing to Monroe\r\n“soliciting his influence with the General to keep him on the pay\r\nroll.”[127] An old translator of twenty years’ experience in the State\r\nDepartment had, in conversation, expressed a curiosity to know where a\r\nDemocrat could be found to translate diplomatic French, and this was\r\njokingly related to Jackson. “Oh, just tell him,” said the General,\r\n“that if necessary I can bring Planche’s whole Creole Battalion up here.\r\nThose French fellows, you know, who helped to defend New Orleans against\r\nthe Red Coats that had just made all the translators here take to the\r\nwoods for their lives.” This flare of spirit gratified and encouraged\r\nthe spoilsmen. “Good, wasn’t it?” Hill wrote to his assistant in\r\nConcord. “Besides his courage and truth, Old Hickory has a fund of humor\r\nin his make-up, but most of his sallies, like the above, are likely to\r\nbe a little bit cruel.”\r\n\r\nAbout the time that Hill was writing to his assistant editor, he was\r\nmeeting daily, at the home of Obadiah B. Brown, a preacher-politician,\r\nwhere Amos Kendall, a Kentucky editor, then obscure, but destined to\r\nbecome the master mind of the Administration, was holding forth, and\r\norganizing a number of fellow journalists who had been useful in the\r\ncampaign, to compel recognition. There, in the home of the jovial\r\npreacher, Kendall and Hill were making common cause with the smiling\r\nMajor M. M. Noah of New York, Nathaniel Green of Massachusetts, and the\r\nquiet but sagacious Gideon Welles of Connecticut. More political history\r\nwas being made in the humble abode of Brown than in the crowded,\r\nsmoke-laden room at Gadsby’s.[128] The Kentucky editor does not seem to\r\nhave encountered the same reticence in Jackson that Hill had found.\r\nAfter his first call at Gadsby’s, we find him writing his wife: “He\r\nexpressed his regards for me and his disposition to serve me, in strong\r\nterms.” And a few days later, after his second call, he writes: “The\r\nother day I had a long conversation with General Jackson. At the close\r\nof it, after saying many flattering things of my capacity, character,\r\netc., he observed, ‘I told one of my friends that you were fit for the\r\nhead of a department, and I shall put you as near the head as\r\npossible.’”[129]\r\n\r\nIt is significant of the change of the times that, while the practical\r\npoliticians of the new school were encouraged and jubilant, the seasoned\r\nveterans of political battle-fields were discouraged and not a little\r\ndisgruntled. Amusing tales of the discomfiture of these were gayly\r\ncarried to the politicians of the Opposition in the salon of Mrs.\r\nSmith, who recorded, toward the close of February, that “every one\r\nthinks there is great confusion and difficulty, mortification and\r\ndisappointment at the Wigwam, as they call the General’s lodgings. Mr.\r\nWoodbury[130] looks glum, as well as several other disappointed\r\nexpectants.”[131]\r\n\r\nThe battle royal occurred in the selection of the Cabinet. The one\r\nprinciple on which Jackson was determined was the exclusion from his\r\nCabinet table of any aspirant for the succession. He had been profoundly\r\nimpressed by the demoralizing effect of the intrigues of the\r\npresidential candidates in the Cabinet of Monroe.[132] This, however,\r\ndid not deter the two powerful men of the party, Calhoun and Van Buren,\r\nfrom exerting themselves to pack the Cabinet with men favorable to their\r\nrespective aspirations for the chief magistracy. Of the latter’s plans\r\nthe President-elect knew nothing. He had probably decided to ask the\r\nclever New York politician to accept the portfolio of State before\r\nleaving the Hermitage. He had been intimate with Van Buren in the\r\nSenate; had been impressed with his tact, diplomacy, and ability, and\r\nespecially with his genius in the creation, consolidation, and drilling\r\nof a party, and in formulating its policies. He was not unmindful of the\r\npart the “Red Fox”[133] had played in his nomination and election. In\r\nview of all the conditions the selection of Van Buren was logical and\r\ninevitable.[134] It was just as inevitable that Calhoun, the\r\nVice-President, should be hostile to the choice. Primarily, we may be\r\nsure, the South Carolinian recognized in the suave and subtle New Yorker\r\na dangerous rival for the succession. Whether he was even that early\r\ninterested in strengthening the South at the expense of the North is not\r\nso certain. However that may be, he appeared in the throng of\r\nwire-pulling politicians at Gadsby’s, earnestly urging that Senator\r\nTazewell of Virginia should be placed at the head of the Cabinet. This\r\nable statesman but a little time before had maintained close political\r\nrelations with Van Buren,[135] but he was an extreme State-Rights\r\nadvocate, entirely satisfactory to Calhoun. During the half-concealed\r\nstruggle over the Cabinet, Van Buren, who had been elected Governor of\r\nNew York and was staying in Albany, was well served in Washington by\r\nJames A. Hamilton, whose mission was to keep in intimate touch with\r\nevents and inform the New Yorker of all developments. Thus it happened\r\nthat Hamilton was with Jackson when, at ten o’clock one morning, Calhoun\r\ncalled for a conference with the President-elect. “I know what it is\r\nabout,” said Jackson to Van Buren’s agent. “He cannot succeed. I wish\r\nyou to remain until he leaves.” It was during this conference, the last\r\nhe ever had with the President on patronage matters, that Calhoun made\r\nhis final stand for Tazewell, or against Van Buren. With great solemnity\r\nhe urged the appointment of the Virginian, largely because of “his great\r\nknowledge and wisdom,” but partly on the ground that it would assure the\r\nsupport of Virginia for the Administration. It is doubtful whether, up\r\nto this time, Calhoun had appreciated the political sagacity of the man\r\nwith whom he dealt. Jackson listened to his importunity with courteous\r\nattention, but did not commit himself. One suggestion he made, however,\r\nwhich must have warned the great Carolinian that his motives were\r\ndivined. When Calhoun stressed the importance of cultivating Virginia,\r\nJackson blandly inquired whether it would not be useful to have the\r\nsupport of New York. Calhoun’s reply disclosed his animus against the\r\n“Little Magician.” The appointment of Clinton, had he lived, might have\r\nguaranteed the support of the Empire State, but the selection of no\r\nother citizen of that State would. He left, no doubt with the feeling\r\nthat he had failed in his mission, and never again approached Jackson on\r\nthe subject of appointments. And the moment he left, a detailed story of\r\nthe conference was given to Hamilton, who promptly sent it to his chief\r\nin Albany.[136]\r\n\r\nWhen Jackson reached the capital he had made no decision as to the\r\nTreasury, and there he was to be buffeted about by many cross-currents.\r\nVan Buren, who was socially and politically intimate with Louis McLane\r\nof Delaware, was anxious that he should be named for the post, and the\r\ngentleman himself was on the ground ready to respond to the summons that\r\nfailed to come. The political tacticians at Gadsby’s reached the\r\ndecision early that the place should be awarded to Pennsylvania, and\r\nSamuel D. Ingham, who had rushed to Washington as a representative of\r\none of the factions, with an application for a subordinate position in\r\nthe Treasury, became an active candidate for the more important honor.\r\nThis was displeasing to Jackson, who favored Henry Baldwin, but in this\r\npreference he was unable to secure any important support among his\r\nadvisers.[137] Strangely enough, powerful influences almost immediately\r\nrushed to the support of the man who would have been delighted with a\r\ncomparatively obscure position. The Pennsylvania congressional\r\ndelegation, on which he had served for years, unanimously endorsed him.\r\nStranger still, Calhoun, with whom Jackson at this juncture had no\r\ndesire to break, became an ardent supporter of his candidacy. He had\r\nserved in the House of Representatives many years before with the\r\nmediocre Pennsylvanian, and had found in him one of his most faithful\r\nidolaters. That his influence, and the desire to recognize him in the\r\nmaking of the Cabinet, was the determining factor, was the consensus of\r\nopinion at the time.\r\n\r\nBut here again appeared cross-currents difficult to understand. South\r\nCarolina, usually so subservient to the wishes of her great statesman,\r\nbut now cool toward him, was uncompromisingly hostile to his favorite\r\nfor the Treasury. The other leading members of the South Carolina\r\ndelegation, known to be opposed to Ingham and to prefer McLane to him,\r\nhad hesitated from motives of delicacy to make their views known to\r\nJackson; and Van Buren’s favorite for the position authorized Hamilton,\r\nVan Buren’s emissary, to notify the General of their willingness to call\r\nif their opinion was wanted.[138] On February 17th, the Carolinians,\r\nincluding Senator Hayne, McDuffie, Hamilton, Archer, and Drayton, filed\r\ninto the throne room at Gadsby’s, and Hamilton, who acted as spokesman,\r\nbegan by tactfully commending the selection of Van Buren, and then\r\nturned to the Treasury. Before he could announce his candidate, Jackson\r\ninterrupted with the announcement that Ingham had been chosen. Nothing\r\ndaunted, Hamilton suggested as a better choice the brilliant Langdon\r\nCheves of South Carolina. “Impossible,” snapped the grim old man. Then\r\nwhy not McLane? That, too, was instantly dismissed, and the Carolinians\r\nleft Gadsby’s in a rage. “I assure you I am cool--damn cool--never half\r\nso cool in my life,” Hamilton exclaimed immediately afterwards.[139]\r\n\r\nFor the War Department there was no such competition, and after an\r\nunsuccessful attempt had been made to conciliate Tazewell with the post,\r\nJackson, who was anxious to have among his advisers one of his old\r\nfriends and managers, satisfied himself with the selection of Senator\r\nJohn H. Eaton of Tennessee.\r\n\r\nThe processes of reasoning leading to the appointment of Senator John\r\nBranch of North Carolina as Secretary of the Navy have been lost to\r\nhistory and there is no clue. We know that Van Buren and his friends\r\nstrongly urged the selection of Woodbury of New Hampshire; and McLane\r\nexpressed the contemporary state of mind in a letter to his friend: “By\r\nwhat interest that miserable old woman, Branch, was ever dreamed of, no\r\none can tell.” This much we know--that Branch himself did not have the\r\nmost remote idea of entering the Cabinet when the invitation reached him\r\nfrom Gadsby’s, and he withheld his acceptance until he could consult\r\nwith a number of his friends.[140] Two reasons have been advanced as\r\nprobable. The one, popular at the time, was that Jackson’s advisers\r\nthought that something should be done to promote the social prestige of\r\nthe Administration; and the other, generally accepted by historians,\r\nthat the appointment was made as another concession to Calhoun. While\r\nthe Carolinian made no request for his inclusion in the Cabinet, Branch\r\nwas one of his most loyal followers.\r\n\r\nThere is no real justification for astonishment over the decision of the\r\nconferees at the Wigwam to ask Senator John McPherson Berrien of Georgia\r\nto accept the position of Attorney-General. Not only was he a brilliant\r\nmember of the Senate, noted as an orator, but his professional\r\nreputation in his section was almost as great as that of Webster in New\r\nEngland. His votes in the Senate on the party measures of the Adams\r\nAdministration had been pleasing to Jackson, and, whether he was named\r\nas another gesture of good-will toward Calhoun, as generally assumed, or\r\nnot, his appointment could not have been displeasing to the\r\nVice-President.\r\n\r\nWhile the Postmaster-General had not hitherto been a member of the\r\nCabinet, the Jackson board of strategy, wishing to manifest its\r\nappreciation of John McLean, who had held the post under Adams while\r\nexerting himself on behalf of Jackson, determined to raise the position\r\nto the Cabinet and retain him.[141]\r\n\r\nThus the Cabinet was completed, and after a fashion indicative of no\r\ndesire on the part of Jackson to quarrel with his Vice-President. Van\r\nBuren, who did not enter into the President’s calculations as to the\r\nsuccession, had been given the most desirable post, but his friends,\r\nMcLane and Woodbury, had been set aside for Ingham and Branch, both\r\ndevoted to the political fortunes of Calhoun. The latter was represented\r\nby half the Cabinet, Ingham, Branch, and Berrien, and no stretch of the\r\nimagination could make the other two members, Eaton and McLean, other\r\nthan absolutely independent of the wily politician of Kinderhook. The\r\nprocesses through which all this was speedily changed enter into one of\r\nthe most fascinating dramas of political intrigue in the history of the\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nWhile the President-elect was holding his conferences, with the\r\nmysterious Major Lewis going in and out at Gadsby’s and playing with the\r\ndestinies of men, and the streets were seething with an incongruous\r\ncrowd shouting their “Hurrah for Jackson,” Jackson was remaining coldly\r\naloof from the occupant of the White House. He had carried to Washington\r\na bitter resentment against Adams and his personal lieutenants, because\r\nof the dastardly attacks upon the woman then buried at the Hermitage. He\r\nmade no call of courtesy, and Adams was stung to the quick. Especially\r\npainful to the old Puritan was the thought that he had been considered\r\ncapable of a vulgar assault upon the good name of a woman. After much\r\nstruggling with his pride, he made the first advance by sending a\r\nmessenger to Jackson to inform him that the White House would be ready\r\nfor his occupancy on the 4th of March. “He brought me the answer,”\r\nAdams records, “that the General cordially thanked him, and hoped that I\r\nwould put myself to no inconvenience to quit the house, but to remain in\r\nit as long as I pleased, even for a month.”[142] A few days later, Adams\r\nsent his messenger to say that his packing might require two or three\r\ndays beyond the 3d, and Jackson replied that he did not wish to put him\r\nto the slightest inconvenience, “but that Mr. Calhoun had suggested that\r\nthere might be danger of the excessive crowds breaking down the rooms at\r\nGadsby’s, and the General had concluded, if it would be perfectly\r\nconvenient to us, to receive his company at the President’s house after\r\nthe inauguration on Wednesday next.” Whereupon Adams “concluded at all\r\nevents to leave the house on Tuesday.”[143] Thus the closing days of his\r\nAdministration must have been bitter, indeed, to the proud old Puritan\r\nof the White House. Deliberately ignored by his successor, tortured by\r\nthe thought of the treachery of McLean and others, the co-workers of his\r\nrégime, depressed, embittered, or in hiding, he appears to have been\r\nutterly forgotten by the society of the capital as well as by the\r\ngeneral public. Justice Story observing his isolation was moved to write\r\nin bitterness to a friend that he had never “felt so forcibly the\r\nemptiness of public honors and public favor.” Certainly no generous\r\nsympathy was felt for him by his triumphant foes. When, on the last\r\nSunday before the inauguration, the pastor of the President’s church\r\nunhappily selected for his text, “What will ye do on the solemn day?”\r\none of Jackson’s courtiers, who had attended the services, hurried back\r\nto Gadsby’s, and the company assembled there went into gales of\r\nlaughter, and agreed that it would be, for some, a “solemn day.”\r\n\r\nThat day was heralded by the thunder of cannon--a day of warmth and\r\nsunshine. All roads led to the Capitol, and from an early hour the\r\nthoroughfares were thronged with the eager, enthusiastic, motley crowd,\r\nrejoicing audibly in the event. Down the Avenue the good-natured mob\r\nfought its way, the splendid Barronet and the stately coaches splashed\r\nby the wagons and the carts, women and children in exquisite finery\r\ncrowded by women and children in home-spun and rags, statesmen jostled\r\nby uncouth frontiersmen, the laborer brushing inconsiderately, and\r\nperhaps a little arrogantly, against the banker--for it was the People’s\r\nDay. When, at eleven o’clock, the aristocratic Mrs. Smith set forth with\r\nher company, she found the Avenue one living mass, flowing sluggishly\r\neastward, with every terrace and portico and balcony packed, and with\r\nall the windows of the Capitol crowded, some to observe the approach on\r\nthe west, and others to witness the ceremony on the east. When the mob\r\ncaught sight of Jackson and his party walking from Gadsby’s in\r\ndemocratic fashion, it pressed in upon him, impeding his approach, but\r\nseeming in nowise to challenge his displeasure, for he alone of his\r\nparty walked with bared head. The spectators on the south terrace\r\nthrilled to the scene--an American king going to his coronation,\r\nacclaimed and accompanied by the plain people. The ceremonies over, he\r\nfought his way to his waiting horse--and down the Avenue he rode,\r\nfollowed by the most picturesque cortège that ever trailed a\r\nconqueror--gentlemen of society and backwoodsmen, scholars and the\r\nilliterate, white and black, the old hobbling on crutches and canes and\r\nchildren clinging to their mothers’ gowns, walking and riding in\r\ncarriages and wagons and carts--following to the People’s House.\r\n\r\nThere the unwieldy mob, in carnival mood, hundreds only accustomed to\r\nthe rough life of the frontier, stormed the mansion, fighting,\r\nscrambling, elbowing, scratching. Waiters appearing with refreshments\r\nwere rushed by the uncouth guests, resulting in the crash of glass and\r\nchina. Men in heavy boots, covered with the mud of the unpaved streets,\r\nsprang upon the chairs and sofas to get a better view of the hero of\r\nthe hour.[144] Women fainted, some were seen with bloody noses, and\r\nJackson was saved from being crushed only by the action of some\r\ngentlemen in making a barrier of their bodies. After this the old\r\nsoldier beat a hasty retreat through the back way to the south, and\r\nsought relief at Gadsby’s.[145] “I never saw such a mixture,” wrote\r\nJustice Story. “The reign of King Mob seemed triumphant.” And Mrs. Smith\r\nwriting of her experience said: “The noisy and disorderly rabble ...\r\nbrought to my mind descriptions I have read of the mobs in the Tuileries\r\nand at Versailles.”\r\n\r\nAnd on the day that Jackson was enjoying, or trembling at, the\r\npopularity of his triumph, where was Adams? The day before the\r\ninauguration he had removed to the home of Commodore Porter on the\r\noutskirts of the city; and at the time the surging multitude was all but\r\ndrowning the roar of the cannon with its cries for Jackson, the\r\ndethroned President, finding the day “warm and springlike,” had ordered\r\nhis horse, and, accompanied by a single companion, had ridden into the\r\ncity “through F Street to the Rockville turnpike,” and over that until\r\nhe reached a road leading to the Porters’--reminded of the passing of\r\nhis power by the neglect of the people.[146]\r\n\r\nHenry Clay shut himself in his house and did not leave it during the\r\nday--tormented by bitter regrets.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately Jackson began to get the reaction on his Cabinet and\r\nhis policies. The disaffections in the house of his friends, which were\r\nto cause him so much embarrassment during the first two years of his\r\nAdministration, began to appear before the shouts of the crowd on the\r\nWhite House lawn had died away. We have it on the authority of the\r\ncapital gossips of the day that when McLean, the Postmaster-General, who\r\nhad betrayed Adams, heard of his new chief’s plans for wholesale\r\ndismissals of postmasters, he warned Jackson that in his proceedings\r\nagainst those officials who had participated in politics he would be\r\nforced to include in the proscription the supporters of Jackson as well\r\nas those who had been faithful to Adams; that Jackson, for a moment\r\nnonplussed, sat puffing at his pipe, then arose, and, after walking up\r\nand down the room several times, stopped abruptly before his\r\nobstreperous minister, with the question: “Mr. McLean, will you accept a\r\nseat on the bench of the Supreme Court?”--and that McLean instantly\r\naccepted.[147] This is vouched for by Nathan Sargent, who says that on\r\nthe evening of the interview Lewis Cass told him, at a reception at the\r\nhome of General Porter, that McLean, with whom he was intimate, had just\r\ndescribed the interview to him.[148] The civic virtue of Mr. McLean has\r\nbeen explained on the theory that he entertained presidential\r\naspirations and did not care to incur the displeasure of the many\r\npostmasters who were friendly to his ambition. However that may be, he\r\nsecured a position of which he was not unworthy, and Jackson probably\r\nsaved himself some trouble by meeting a sudden crisis in a truly\r\nJacksonian way.\r\n\r\nIt is reasonable to assume that during the brief moments he walked the\r\nfloor puffing his pipe, he determined upon McLean’s successor. One week\r\nbefore his inauguration, he had given James A. Hamilton a list of\r\napplicants for office with the request for an opinion and report, and\r\namong these was the application of William T. Barry of Kentucky for a\r\nplace on the Supreme Bench. The applications had been returned to him\r\nwith the recommendation that the Kentuckian be appointed. He was known\r\nto Jackson as an “organization man.” It was probably the matter of a\r\nmoment, for one of the President’s quick decision, to make the\r\nexchange--McLean for the Bench, Barry for the Cabinet.[149] His efforts\r\nto soothe the injured feelings of Senator Tazewell, whose heart had been\r\nset on the portfolio of State, were not so successful. After the\r\ndisappointed statesman had refused the War Department, some of the\r\nJackson tacticians conceived the idea of offering him the mission to\r\nLondon, and for a few days the Virginian seemed tempted. But one week\r\nafter the inauguration, he wrote the President that domestic reasons\r\nprecluded an acceptance. Keenly disappointed and concerned, Jackson,\r\nafter a consultation with one of his advisers,[150] wrote a personal\r\nnote to Tazewell requesting him to call at the White House. It is not\r\nincomprehensible that in his angry mood the proud Southerner should have\r\nresented the earnest importunity of the direct Jackson, and he left the\r\nPresident with the statement to McLean that he had not liked the\r\nGeneral’s manner in looking him through and through and telling him he\r\nmust go. He had looked upon it as a military order, and considered the\r\nmatter at rest. This opened the way, however, for the recognition of Van\r\nBuren’s friend, Louis McLane, whose ruffled feelings were smoothed by\r\nthe appointment to the English Court. But within a week two of Jackson’s\r\nparty friends and supporters, McLean and Tazewell, had been alienated\r\nand were ripe for the seduction of the Opposition.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, as soon as Clay could recover from the shock of defeat, he\r\nbegan the organization and solidification of a bitter and stubborn\r\nopposition to the Administration. As early as the first of January it\r\nwas evident that “the aim of the defeated party is to get a majority in\r\nthe Senate and thereby to control the President.”[151] During the first\r\nfew weeks of the new Administration the iron sank deep into the souls\r\nof the dispossessed office-holders and their friends. It was manifest\r\nthat there was something more than a new master in the White House--that\r\na régime had passed, a dynasty had fallen. Previous Presidents had\r\nentered office with the good wishes of most of their political\r\nopponents, but it was clear from the beginning that the dispossessed had\r\nsteeled themselves against conciliation, were planning to find fault on\r\ngeneral principles, and to exert themselves to the utmost to wreck the\r\nAdministration. The Cabinet was greeted with derision and the Whig\r\ndrawing-rooms made merry over the “millennium of the minnows.” All the\r\nmembers of the new official family were ridiculed with the exception of\r\nVan Buren and even he, while conceded to be a “profound politician,” was\r\n“not supposed to be an able statesman.”[152] The vitriolic and\r\nvindictive Adams, nursing his wrath to keep it warm, poured forth on the\r\npages of his diary vituperative denunciations of the Cabinet, together\r\nwith the gossip of the malicious. Ten days of the new régime, and he had\r\nrendered the verdict that “the only principles yet discernible in the\r\nconduct of the President” were “to feed the cormorant appetite for\r\nplace, and to reward the prostitution of canvassing defamers.”[153]\r\n\r\nWhile Adams indulged in these unfriendly reflections merely to feed his\r\npersonal vanity, and to record his superiority, Clay, equally bitter,\r\nwas not content to shut his reflection up between the covers of a book.\r\nTo him defeat had been especially bitter. He hated Jackson with\r\nvindictive malice because the latter really credited the “bargain”\r\nstory, and had sanctioned its circulation. His overpowering passion was\r\nto reach the Presidency. He had entered the official household of Adams\r\nas the head of the Cabinet when the “Secretarial Succession” seemed\r\ndefinitely established, and had looked forward to succeeding his chief\r\nat the end of his second Administration. The fact that there had been\r\nno second Administration had been due, in part, to the prevalent opinion\r\nthat Clay had entered into a bargain for power, and he faced retirement\r\nfrom public life feeling that his great opportunity had failed him and\r\nthat his reputation had been stained. He was the type of man whose\r\nbitterness must find relief in action. From the moment he recovered from\r\nthe shock of the election, he dedicated himself to the pursuit of\r\nJackson.\r\n\r\nIn judging of the sincerity of his unrelenting opposition during the\r\nnext eight years, it is well to bear in mind that before Jackson had\r\nperfected a policy, or proclaimed a principle, Mr. Clay attended a\r\nbanquet given in his honor within a stone’s throw of the White House, at\r\nwhich he assailed the President with an intemperance of denunciation\r\nnever exceeded in later years. This was evidently personal. One week\r\nafter the inauguration he said to Mrs. Bayard Smith: “There is not in\r\nCairo or in Constantinople a greater moral despotism than is at this\r\nmoment exercised over public opinion here. Why, a man dare not avow what\r\nhe thinks or feels, or shake hands with a personal friend, if he happens\r\nto differ from the powers that be.”[154] On the very day this remarkable\r\nstatement was recorded by the chronicler of the Whig drawing-rooms,\r\nAdams wrote in his diary: “Mr. Clay told me some time since that he had\r\nreceived invitations at several places on his way to Lexington to public\r\ndinners, and should attend them, and that he intended freely to express\r\nhis opinions.”[155] A little later Adams notes that while riding he\r\npassed Mr. Clay in a carriage driving toward Baltimore on his way to\r\nKentucky--pale, stern, and sour. On that journey, and without having at\r\nthat time any particular actions of the new Administration on which to\r\nbase an attack, he spoke wherever the opportunity was afforded, and\r\nalways with a vehement denunciation of President Jackson.\r\n\r\nThe inauguration was over; the people from afar, having seen “their”\r\nPresident and visited “their” White House, had returned to their homes;\r\nand Henry Clay, the most consummate of politicians, one of the most\r\neloquent of men, was already meditating upon the organized assault that\r\nwas to be made upon the new régime. Now let us acquaint ourselves with\r\nthe advisers with whom the President had surrounded himself officially.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nBy common consent the Whig aristocracy conceded that Martin Van Buren\r\nwas the strong man of the Cabinet because of an uncanny cleverness as a\r\npolitician, while denying him the qualities of statesmanship or\r\nintellectual leadership. Even as a politician tradition would have him\r\nof the superficial, manipulating, intriguing sort. History had generally\r\naccepted this tradition until Mr. Shepard’s masterful biography[156]\r\nfocused attention upon his career, and the publication of his\r\nfascinating “Autobiography” disclosed his intellectuality. He stood out\r\namong the politicians of his time, to whom history has been kinder,\r\nbecause of his refusal to indulge in the popular personal attacks or to\r\nstoop to disreputable intrigues. A man of even temper, blessed with a\r\nsense of humor, he found it not only possible but profitable and\r\npleasurable to maintain social relations with political opponents, and\r\nall that the embittered Adams could see in this was that “he thought it\r\nmight one day be to his interest to seek friendship.” In senatorial\r\ndebates he had discussed principles and policies calmly, instead of\r\nindulging in flamboyant discourses flaming with personalities--and this\r\nwas accepted in his day as evidence that he held his principles lightly.\r\nAdams wrote that “his principles are always subordinate to his\r\nambition.”[157]\r\n\r\nThis “superficial politician” was the greatest lawyer elected to the\r\nPresidency before the Civil War, and, with the possible exception of the\r\nsecond Harrison, the greatest lawyer-President we have had. Living in a\r\ncommunity overwhelmingly Federalistic, this “trimmer without principles”\r\nbecame a bitter opponent of Federalism. With all the rich and powerful\r\nof the locality allied with Federalism, this “courtier” entered the\r\nother camp. When Burr was a candidate for Governor, with the support of\r\nVan Buren’s preceptor in the law, this young man, who “was under the\r\ninfluence of his evil genius,” ardently supported the Clinton-Livingston\r\ncandidate, who was elected. When he entered politics, he found the\r\nspoils system thoroughly established in New York, and political\r\nproscription practiced by both parties, but that was not to prevent his\r\nenemies from charging him with its initiation. He did not quarrel with\r\nthe system. He used, but never abused it. And in the days of his\r\nlimitation to State politics, he displayed qualities of statesmanship,\r\npatriotism, and courage. New York Federalism did not dismiss him as a\r\nmere schemer and intriguer when he led his party in the State Senate. He\r\nmet the Federalist attack upon the War of 1812 upon the floor of the\r\nSenate, and not in party caucus. When Federalism fought every needful\r\nmeasure, he became as much the spokesman of the war party in Albany as\r\nClay, Calhoun, and Grundy in Washington. In reaching an estimate of Van\r\nBuren, it is important to bear in mind that this alleged man of\r\nindecision, without initiative or constructive capacity, was the author\r\nof “the most energetic war measure” adopted in the country.[158] As a\r\nmember of the Constitutional Convention of New York, dealing with the\r\nextension of suffrage, when Chancellor Kent, giving free rein to his\r\naristocratic tendencies, was opposing the extension, and mere demagogues\r\nwere advocating the immediate letting down of the bars to all, it is\r\nsignificant, both of his Americanism and\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARTIN VAN BUREN]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THOMAS HART BENTON]\r\n\r\nhis wisdom, that Van Buren scorned both the rôle of reactionary and\r\ndemagogue, and proposed the plan for the gradual extension of suffrage\r\nin a speech couched in the language of seasoned statesmanship. Thus, at\r\nthe time he entered National life, there was nothing in his career to\r\njustify the conventional estimate of his public character.\r\n\r\nWith the inauguration of Adams, soon after he had entered the United\r\nStates Senate, Van Buren became the recognized leader of the Opposition,\r\nand he set himself the task of organizing and militantizing a party to\r\nfight the Federalistic trend of the President. There were various\r\nelements on which he could draw. With his genius for organization and\r\ndirection, he made it his work to seek a common ground upon which all\r\ncould stand together in harmony. He fought the principles and policies\r\nof the Administration in dignified fashion, without recourse to\r\nscurrility; but he capitalized every mistake and gave it fullest\r\npublicity through the circulation of carefully prepared speeches, after\r\nthe fashion of the present day. Careful to discriminate, even in his\r\nattacks, between personal and political wrongdoing, he treated Adams\r\nwith the utmost courtesy. With a party formed, he drilled it as\r\ncarefully as was ever done by the Albany Regency. He instilled into it\r\nthe party spirit. He mobilized an army. With this he fought the\r\nAdministration on the floor.\r\n\r\nBut he was one of the first, if not the first, to take the people\r\noutside the halls of Congress into consideration. To create a party\r\nwithout as well as within the Congress, he arranged for the circulation\r\nof carefully prepared senatorial speeches for the moulding of public\r\nopinion in the highways and the byways. Thus he was probably responsible\r\nfor the delivery of the first congressional speeches intended solely for\r\ncampaign use.\r\n\r\nIn person he was slight, erect, and scarcely of middle height. His\r\nintellectuality was indicated by his high, broad forehead, and his\r\nbright, quick eye. His smile, which was habitual, was genial and seemed\r\nsincere. His features, generally, were pleasing. His manner was always\r\ncourtly, and he made a study of deportment. No professional diplomat of\r\nthe Old World, living in the atmosphere of courts, could have been more\r\npolished. Contemporaries have described him as “extraordinarily bright\r\nand attractive, but without anything supercilious.”[159] In social life\r\nhe was a favorite. Few men of his period were better fitted for the\r\ndrawing-room. An entertaining talker, he could converse intelligently\r\nupon a multitude of subjects and could pass from a political conference\r\nwith the Kitchen Cabinet to a social call on Adams, or a chat with Clay,\r\nwithout effort or embarrassment. Fond of feminine society, he could be\r\nas charming to a débutante as to a grande dame, and we find him\r\ndelighting the brilliant Mrs. Livingston with his intellectual charm,\r\nwhile captivating her daughter, Cora, with his juvenile levity.\r\nFastidious to a degree, he could enjoy the unconventional moments of\r\nJackson in his shirt-sleeves and with his pipe, and make the pleasure\r\nmutual. This premier of an Administration that contemporaries of the\r\nOpposition loved to describe as plebeian and vulgar “was perhaps as\r\npolished and captivating a person as the social circles of the Republic\r\nhave ever known.”[160] As we shall see, nothing ruffled him. He never\r\nforgot his dignity nor lost his temper. He was all suavity. He was all\r\nart.\r\n\r\nHe lives in history as a politician and President and is never thought\r\nof as an orator. He belonged rather to the type of parliamentary speaker\r\nwhich followed the scintillating period when Pitt declaimed in stately\r\nsentences and Fox thundered with emotional eloquence--the conversational\r\ntype which is still prevalent at Westminster. He made no pretense to an\r\nartful literary style, but his speeches were in good taste. We have the\r\ntradition that he not only prepared his speeches with infinite care,\r\nwhich is probable, but that he rehearsed them before a mirror, which is\r\ndebatable. It is said that on his retirement from the Senate, and at the\r\nsale of his household goods at auction, “it was noticed that the carpet\r\nbefore the large looking-glass was worn threadbare,” and that “it was\r\nthere that he rehearsed his speeches.”[161] That he was something of an\r\nartist and an actor we shall see in the course of the recital of the\r\nevents of the Jackson Administration.\r\n\r\nSecretary of the Treasury Ingham was a Pennsylvania paper manufacturer\r\nwho possessed little learning and stood in no awe of genius. His career\r\nhad been that of a petty but persistent plodder who knew the ways of\r\ncunning. His mind was prosily practical, and he thought solely in terms\r\nof money. His fourteen years in Congress had been barren of achievement,\r\nbut his business training had given him a certain advantage over more\r\nbrilliant men in the work of the committees. He was the forerunner of\r\nthe machine politician of a later day, skillful in intrigue,\r\nunscrupulous in methods, and resourceful in the work of organization.\r\nHis general character is not easily deduced from the conflicting\r\nopinions of his contemporaries. One of these, unfriendly to the Jackson\r\nrégime, wrote that he “is a good man of unimpeachable and unbending\r\nintegrity”;[162] while Adams, after relating an incident tending to an\r\nopposite conclusion, tells us that “there is a portrait of Ingham in\r\nCaracci’s picture of the Lord’s Supper”--which is the nearest approach\r\nto a description of his appearance that can be found. There is a general\r\nagreement, however, as to the inferiority of his talents, and in our\r\npolitical history he is scarcely the shadow of a silhouette.\r\n\r\nQuite a different character was Secretary of War Eaton, a gentleman of\r\neducation, polish, amiability, capacity, and wealth. The possession of a\r\nfortune deprived him of an incentive to the full exertion of his\r\ntalents, and he frankly preferred leisure to labor, discouraged the\r\napproach of clients, and liked nothing better than a quiet corner of his\r\nlibrary at his country home near Nashville. There was nothing in his\r\nappearance, his manner, or conversation remotely to suggest the\r\nfrontiersman, and, on the contrary, observers were impressed by his\r\ndignity and poise, his courtliness and courtesy. Even in the bitter days\r\nwhen society was in league against his wife, we find one of her harshest\r\ncritics writing that “every one that knows esteems, and many love him\r\nfor his benevolence and amiability.”[163] He possessed many advantages\r\nfor a political career. Having the time and money to devote to politics,\r\nhe early developed a genius for organization, and an uncanny capacity\r\nfor intrigue. The campaign of 1828 found him entrusted with much of the\r\nimportant work--the delicate missions. Wherever Jackson lacked or needed\r\nan organization, or one in existence required stiffening, there went\r\nEaton, doing his work furtively, and on the surface nothing but its\r\nachievement indicated that it had been undertaken.[164] It was his fine\r\nItalian hand which wrought such havoc with Clay’s forces in Kentucky.\r\nWhen that State began to waver as to Clay, Jackson determined to force\r\nthe fighting in a territory at first thought hopelessly lost to the\r\nDemocracy. Even Benton found his way to the “dark and bloody ground,”\r\nbut tradition has it that it was the suave and furtive Eaton, who\r\nappeared in different parts of Kentucky, making no speeches, and half\r\nconcealing himself in a mantle of mystery, who divorced from Clay so\r\nmany of his supporters. There is a sinister aspect to the general\r\ndescription of his activities; and his enemies, and Jackson’s, always\r\ninsisted that he had parceled out jobs with a lavish hand. A man of\r\nculture, a soldier of acknowledged gallantry, a lawyer of ability, he\r\nwas destined to an unhappy notoriety, but he deserved a better fate.\r\n\r\nThe patrician of the Administration was Secretary of the Navy Branch,\r\nwho, like Eaton, had inherited an ample fortune, and had divided his\r\ntime between politics, the practice of the law, and the management of a\r\nlarge plantation. At the time he entered the Cabinet, he had\r\ndistinguished himself in the politics of North Carolina, had served\r\nthree terms as Governor, and was a member of the United States\r\nSenate--scarcely the record of an obscure man. As chief executive of his\r\nState, his record had been far from that of a colorless time-serving\r\npolitician without constructive qualities or vision. If his messages\r\nwere couched in the lofty, pompous phrases of the period, they were not\r\nwithout substance. He was a pioneer in the field of popular education,\r\nthe leader of a crusade against capital punishment for many crimes, an\r\nadvocate of the substitution of imprisonment for the death penalty, and\r\nhe urged the establishment of a penitentiary based on the idea of\r\nreformation. A man of great wealth, and an aristocrat by temperament, he\r\nled a fight against imprisonment for debt.[165] His, too, is the\r\ndistinction of having in that early day proposed the strict regulation\r\nof the medical profession as a protection of the public against\r\nimpostors. A planter, and the owner of many slaves, he insisted, while\r\nGovernor, on the protection of the legal rights of the blacks; and the\r\npetition of the entire population of Raleigh, the importunities of a\r\nhundred and twenty young women, the plea of State officials, were not\r\nsufficient to persuade him to save from the gallows a young white man\r\nwho had murdered a slave.[166] In the Senate, while not distinguished as\r\nan orator, he was considered a strong debater and was respected as a man\r\nof courage and deep convictions.\r\n\r\nThe portrait of Branch, which hangs in the Navy Department in\r\nWashington, suggests, in the slender profile and luminous eyes, the\r\npoet, rather than the politician. He is described by one who saw him\r\noften in his Washington days as “tall, well-proportioned, graceful in\r\ngestures, and affable and kindly in manner.”[167] He had the\r\ngraciousness of the Southern aristocrat of the old school, and was\r\ndevoted to the social standards and customs of his section. Strongly\r\nattached to his home and family, having the poet’s love of the artistic,\r\nhe surrounded himself with beauty, and his home at Enfield was a\r\ncomfortable and stately mansion surrounded by a smooth lawn, in the\r\nmidst of gardens, orchards, and shade trees. His political career and\r\nthe course of the Jackson Administration were to be greatly influenced\r\nby his devotion to his wife and daughters, and to his social ideals.\r\n\r\nIn John McPherson Berrien, the Attorney-General, we have a character\r\nwith whom history has played strange pranks. When he entered the\r\nCabinet, he was conceded to be one of the most polished orators of his\r\ntime and one of the famous lawyers of the South. His Washington début in\r\nthe Supreme Court, in a case involving the seizure of an African slave\r\nship, had been a spectacular triumph.[168] All contemporaries agree as\r\nto his extraordinary gifts of eloquence. Perley Poore describes him as\r\n“a polished and effective orator.”[169] Another contemporary found him\r\n“a model for chaste, free, beautiful elocution.”[170] Still another has\r\nit that “he spoke the court language of the Augustan age.”[171] Even the\r\nblasé John Marshall, who listened to Webster and Choate, was so\r\nimpressed that he dubbed him “the honey-tongued Georgian youth.”[172] He\r\nhad been in the Senate three years when a speech upon the tariff\r\nimpelled the press of the period to describe him as “the American\r\nCicero”--a designation that clung to him through life. The greatest\r\nspeech made by any of the leaders of the Opposition on the Panama\r\nMission was the constitutional argument of Berrien.[173] As a man he was\r\ncold and reserved, an aristocrat in manner, as in feeling. He made a\r\nvirtue of not cultivating the multitude, scorned all compromise with his\r\nconvictions, firmly believed in himself, and was not at all impressed\r\nwith opposition. Utterly without tact or diplomacy, caustic and\r\nsarcastic, he incurred bitter enmities, but his admirers, who liked to\r\ncompare him with Cicero, took pride in this weakness.[174] As a\r\npolitical leader, he was dictatorial and demanded obedience without\r\nquestion. The slightest hesitation on the part of his tried and truest\r\nfriends was usually followed by coldness on his part. Selfish to a\r\ndegree, he was always keen for his personal advancement.[175] Few more\r\nbrilliant men have ever been Attorney-General of the United States.\r\n\r\nIf Postmaster-General Barry was unknown to Washington, it was a matter\r\nof indifference to him. In politics he was an exotic. Entering Congress\r\nas a young man, he could have remained indefinitely, but congressional\r\nlife did not allure him. For twenty years he had been an influential\r\nState politician, serving in the legislature until sent to the United\r\nStates Senate to fill an unexpired term. It is an interesting commentary\r\non his preference for State office that he resigned from the Senate,\r\nwhere he might have remained, to become Chief Justice of the State\r\nSupreme Court. Living in Lexington as a neighbor of Henry Clay, he had\r\nbeen for many years one of the great leader’s most ardent supporters,\r\nand it is significant of the character of the man that, while he\r\nsupported Clay against Jackson in 1824, the “bargain” story transformed\r\nhim into a bitter foe.\r\n\r\nIn view of their relations to the Jackson Administration years later,\r\nthe estimate of Barry reached by Amos Kendall in 1814, and recorded in\r\nhis “Autobiography,” is interesting, and serves to account for the\r\nfeeling, scarcely concealed, with which the journalist-politician\r\nafterwards undertook the unraveling of the difficulties into which Barry\r\nhad plunged the Post-Office Department. It was when Kendall was on his\r\nway to Kentucky that he first met the Lexington politician and went down\r\nthe Ohio River with him and Mrs. Barry with “servants, horses, and\r\ncarriages,” in a boat thirty feet long, with three apartments. At the\r\nend of the journey Kendall wrote: “He appears to be a very good man but\r\nnot a great man. For our passage he charged nothing, and in every way\r\ntreated me like a gentleman. His lady seems to be a woman of good\r\ndisposition, but uneducated.” In contradiction to this estimate, we have\r\nanother in which he is described as possessing extraordinary abilities,\r\nactive business habits, an exact knowledge of men and things, and as\r\nbeing “a great orator.”[176] And this same authority describes Mrs.\r\nBarry as “frank, lady-like, free from affectations, possessing a fine\r\nperson and agreeable manners.” Parton tells us that he was “agreeable\r\nand amiable, but not a business man”--which is the final verdict of\r\nhistory. In person he was above the medium height, but slender and thin\r\nin face. He was modest in demeanor, and energetic--even though he did\r\nnot always properly direct his energy--and fond of society. He became\r\nPostmaster-General because, according to the Jackson standard, he had\r\nrichly earned the reward.\r\n\r\nSuch was the Jackson Cabinet which accompanied him into office. There\r\nhave been greater Cabinets, but many inferior to it, and few with men\r\npossessing greater ability than Van Buren or Berrien, or more social\r\ndistinction than Branch. There was not a single member who did not\r\npossess at least good ability, and Jackson had, or thought he had, what\r\nhe said he proposed to have, a Cabinet without a presidential aspirant.\r\nIt is strange that the one man who developed into a candidate almost\r\nimmediately was the one to whom he became most ardently attached.\r\n\r\nWe shall now note the first troubles of the official family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE RED TERROR AND THE WHITE\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThirteen days after the inauguration, the Senate, having confirmed the\r\nCabinet, adjourned, and the Administration could look forward to almost\r\nnine months of non-interference from the Congress. The pre-inaugural\r\nprediction that the President would adopt a policy of proscription of\r\nhis political foes was almost immediately justified by events. The\r\n“spoils system,” as an important cog in the machinery of political\r\nparties, thus frankly recognized, dates from this time. Through all the\r\nintervening years the civil service reformers have indulged in the most\r\nbitter denunciation of Jackson on the untenable theory that but for him\r\npublic offices would never have been used as the spoils of party. Some\r\nof the most conscientious of historians have created the impression that\r\nthe adoption of a prescriptive policy was due to something inherently\r\nwrong in the President. As a matter of fact, Jackson was the victim of\r\nconditions and circumstances, and the new political weapon grew out of\r\nthe exigencies of a new political era.\r\n\r\nFor many years political parties had been chaotic, vapory, and\r\nindefinite; and if the politics of the young Republic had not been\r\ndrifting toward personal government, it had been partaking of the nature\r\nof government by cliques and classes. The first Message of John Quincy\r\nAdams had made the definite division of the people into political\r\nparties inevitable--these parties standing for well-defined,\r\nantagonistic policies. Van Buren had early caught the drift and had\r\ncleverly organized a party standing for principles and policies, rather\r\nthan for personalities. John M. Clayton, soon to become one of the\r\noutstanding figures of the Opposition to the Jackson Administration, who\r\nhad seldom voted even in presidential elections because of his\r\nindifference to the mere ambitions of individuals, understood that in\r\n1828 something more was involved, and threw himself into the contest in\r\nsupport of Adams. And Clay was even then looking forward to the\r\norganization of a party pledged to internal improvements and a\r\nprotective tariff.\r\n\r\nThe Jackson Administration marks the beginning of political parties as\r\nwe have known them for almost a century.\r\n\r\nIt was in this compaign, too, that the masses awakened to the fact that\r\nthey had interests involved, and possessed power. Previous to this the\r\naristocracy, the business and financial interests, and the\r\nintellectuals, alone, determined the governmental personnel. Men went\r\ninto training for the Presidency, and, as in a lodge, passed, as a\r\nmatter of course, from the Cabinet to the Vice-Presidency, and thence to\r\nthe chief magistracy. An office-holding class, feeling itself secure in\r\na life tenure, had grown up.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, the election of Jackson was due to the rising of the\r\nmasses. Thousands who had never before participated in politics played\r\ninfluential parts in the campaign. The victory, they considered theirs.\r\nThus they had flocked to Washington as never before to an inauguration,\r\nrejoicing in the induction of “their” President into office, and all too\r\nmany pressing claims to recognition and entertaining hopes of entering\r\nupon their reward. Before the inauguration, the grim old warrior,\r\nawaiting the opportunity, at Gadsby’s, to take the oath of office, had\r\nbeen fairly mobbed by ardent partisans of his cause, demanding the\r\nexpulsion of the enemy and the appointment of his supporters to office.\r\nThe Jackson press had been particularly insistent upon this point. Duff\r\nGreen, of the “National Telegraph,” had early announced that he\r\nnaturally assumed that the office-holders who had actively campaigned\r\nfor Adams would make way for the victors. This same feeling had spread\r\ninto every community in the country. Isaac Hill, writing in the “New\r\nHampshire Patriot” immediately after the election, had sounded the\r\nonslaught for the Democracy of New England.[177] And soon after reaching\r\nWashington, and sensing the atmosphere at Gadsby’s, the New England\r\neditor had written joyously to a friend: “You may say to all our anxious\r\nAdamsites that THE BARNACLES WILL BE SCRAPED CLEAN OFF THE SHIP OF\r\nSTATE. Most of them have grown so large and stick so tight that the\r\nscraping process will doubtless be fatal to them.”\r\n\r\nBefore Jackson’s entry into the White House, the scenes in and about\r\nGadsby’s were scarcely less than scandalous. A great perspiring mob\r\nswarmed in the streets in front, crowded the tap-room, jostled its way\r\nin the halls, and, notwithstanding the efforts of Major Lewis, it\r\ndemanded and secured admission to the President’s private apartment. All\r\nadmitted themselves responsible for Jackson’s election. Amos Kendall,\r\nencountering a pompous stranger on the Avenue, was invited to look upon\r\nthe man who had “delivered Pennsylvania.”[178] James A. Hamilton, who\r\nwas close to Jackson in the early days of the Administration, was\r\nimportuned by an Indianian, who had taken the electoral vote of the\r\nState to the Capitol, to intercede on his behalf for the Register’s\r\noffice at Crawfordsville, or the Marshalship. This typical office-seeker\r\nhad “calculated to remain a few weeks ... hoping that some of these\r\nviolent Adams men may receive their walking papers.” He carried letters\r\nof recommendation from all the Democratic members of the State\r\nLegislature “for any office I can ask.” But, in view of the brisk\r\ncompetition, would not Hamilton kindly recall that he had received\r\nletters from the Hoosier bearing on the campaign, and personally testify\r\nto the important part he had played?[179] Others depended upon the\r\nlength of their petitions, and two applicants from Pennsylvania, for the\r\nsame office, had signers so numerous that the number had to be estimated\r\nby the length of the sheets.[180]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile there is no question but that Jackson was eager to serve his\r\nfriends, if not to punish his enemies. From the moment of his election,\r\nhe had entertained no illusions as to the character of the opposition\r\nhis Administration would encounter. It was an open secret that his\r\nenemies, long before the inauguration, had begun to organize for the\r\ndiscrediting of his Administration. He was familiar with the bitterness\r\nof Clay. And, with the determination to make his Administration a\r\nsuccess, from his point of view, he turned his attention to preparations\r\nfor the fight. His military training told him that it was fatal to enter\r\na campaign with traitors in the camp. The disloyalty from which Adams\r\nhad suffered had not been lost upon him.[181] And he had fixed\r\nconvictions as to political organization. “To give effect to any\r\nprinciples,” he said, “you must avail yourself of the physical force of\r\nan organized body of men. This is true alike in war, politics, or\r\nreligion. You cannot organize men in effective bodies without giving\r\nthem a reason for it. And when the organization is once made, you cannot\r\nkeep it together unless you hold constantly before its members why they\r\nare organized.”[182] Thus party politics, in the modern sense, began\r\nwith Jackson, and the spoils system grew out of the exigencies of party\r\npolitics. Vicious though it may be, it is significant of its appeal to\r\nthe rank and file of party workers, upon whom party success depends,\r\nthat politicians of all parties, including Lincoln, have adopted it\r\nwithout shame.\r\n\r\nIt does not appear that Jackson was greatly influenced in his course by\r\nhis advisers, of either his constitutional or Kitchen Cabinet. Van\r\nBuren, who has been wrongfully accused of so many things, and among\r\nothers, of having been the dominating influence as to the spoils system,\r\nheard of the plan for sweeping changes with grave misgivings. “If the\r\nGeneral makes one removal at this time,” he said in a letter to Hamilton\r\nwritten from Albany, “he must go on. So far as depends on me, my course\r\nwould be to restore by a single order every one who has been turned out\r\nby Mr. Clay for political reasons, unless circumstances of a personal\r\ncharacter have since arisen to make the appointment in any case\r\nimproper. To ascertain that will take a little time. There I would\r\npause.” This, from the head of his official family.\r\n\r\nAnd the most intimate of his advisers, of the Kitchen Cabinet, Major\r\nLewis, is reported to have written to the President: “In relation to the\r\nprinciple of rotation in office, I embrace this occasion to enter my\r\nsolemn protest against it; not on account of my office, but because I\r\nhold it to be fraught with the greatest mischief to the country. If ever\r\nit should be carried out _in extenso_, the days of this Republic will,\r\nin my opinion, be numbered; for whenever the impression shall become\r\ngeneral that the Government is only valuable on account of its offices,\r\nthe great and paramount interests of the country will be lost sight of,\r\nand the Government itself ultimately destroyed.” With the possible\r\nexception of Eaton, who was a practical politician in the modern sense,\r\nand Van Buren, to the extent just indicated, none of the members of the\r\nCabinet were spoilsmen at heart; and Amos Kendall, the genius of the\r\nKitchen Cabinet, would unquestionably have preferred to be spared the\r\npain of turning men out of office. To be sure, the jovial but vindictive\r\nDuff Green, who spent much time at the elbow of Jackson in the early\r\nmonths of the Administration, was insistent upon the punishment of\r\nenemies, but the responsibility for the adoption of the policy rests\r\nupon the President himself.\r\n\r\nAnd the result was that the spring and summer months of 1829 were filled\r\nwith the clamor of importunate pleas, not unmixed with threats and\r\ncurses, from the office-seekers. In many instances the wives and\r\ndaughters of the applicants fluttered down upon Washington to reënforce\r\nthe husband and the father.[183] One of the General’s most ardent\r\nsupporters left the capital two days after the inauguration bitterly\r\ndenouncing him for his failure to appoint the irate one to a position\r\nnot then vacant.[184] Cabinet officers were harassed, bombarded,\r\nfollowed from their offices to their homes and back again, until several\r\nof them confessed that life had become a burden, and they were forced to\r\nclose their doors to applicants until a late hour in the afternoon to\r\nfind time for the transaction of public business.[185] Such aspirants as\r\nwere not upon the ground in person were either represented by friends\r\nwho were, or they peppered the members of the Cabinet with letters. One\r\npeculiarly offensive candidate for the collectorship of customs in New\r\nYork wrote to an equally disreputable friend: “No damn rascal who made\r\nuse of an office or its profits for the purpose of keeping Mr. Adams in\r\nand General Jackson out of power is entitled to the least leniency save\r\nthat of hanging. Whether or not I shall get anything in the general\r\nscramble for plunder remains to be seen, but I rather guess I shall. I\r\nknow Mr. Ingham slightly, and would recommend that you push like the\r\ndevil if you expect anything from that quarter.”[186] And in the letter\r\nfrom Ingham to the seeker of “plunder” we have abundant evidence that\r\nthe advice was accepted: “These [his duties] cannot be postponed; and I\r\ndo assure you that I am compelled daily to file away long lists of\r\nrecommendations, etc., without reading them, although I work eighteen\r\nhours out of the twenty-four with all diligence. The appointments can be\r\npostponed; other matters cannot; and it was one of the prominent errors\r\nof the late Administration that they suffered many important public\r\ninterests to be neglected, while they were cruising about to secure or\r\nbuy up partisans. This we must not do.”[187] The same man, having\r\nwritten an insolent letter to Van Buren, was sharply rebuked by him.\r\n“Here I am,” wrote the Secretary of State, “engaged in the most\r\nintricate and important affairs, which are new to me, and upon the\r\nsuccessful conduct of which my reputation as well as the interests of\r\nthe country depend, and which keep me occupied from early in the morning\r\nuntil late at night. And can you think it kind or just to harass me\r\nunder such circumstances with letters which no man of common sensibility\r\ncan read without pain?... I must be plain with you.... The terms upon\r\nwhich you have seen fit to place our intercourse are inadmissible.”[188]\r\n\r\nNor was this clamor for office confined to the more important\r\npositions--it reached down to the most menial places, to those of the\r\ngardener, the janitor, and messenger. Worse still--men in position to\r\nserve were even appealed to for place by members of their immediate\r\nfamilies. Thus we find Amos Kendall writing to his wife: “I had thought\r\nbefore of trying to get some place for your father, but I cannot do\r\nanything until I am myself appointed. I hope in a year or two, and\r\nperhaps sooner, to find some situation that will enable him to live near\r\nus, and comfortably.”[189]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the clerks in Washington lived in a state of terror. Men who\r\nhad long worked in harmony, and on terms of intimacy, were afraid to\r\ntalk to one another. Every one suddenly assumed the aspect of a spy and\r\nan informer. “All the subordinate officers of the Government, and even\r\nthe clerks are full of tremblings and anxiety,” wrote one woman to a\r\ncorrespondent. “To add to this general gloom, we have horrible weather,\r\nsnowstorm after snowstorm, the river frozen up and the poor\r\nsuffering.”[190] The majority of the subordinates and clerks, many the\r\nne’er-do-wells of distinguished families, assuming that they were\r\nassured of a life position, had lived up to, and beyond, their meager\r\nincomes, and suddenly found themselves unfit for other employment and\r\nconfronted with dismissal.[191] And slowly, but surely, the dismissals\r\ncame, leaving many in desperate straits, without sufficient funds to\r\nreach their homes, and unfit to earn a livelihood if they did. Some were\r\ndriven to desperation. One dismissed employee of the Custom House in\r\nBoston went “in a transport of grief” to Ingham with a plea to be\r\ninformed of the cause of his dismissal, only to be told that offices\r\nwere not hereditary.[192] One clerk in the War Department cut his throat\r\nfrom ear to ear; another in the State Department went stark mad. But all\r\nappeals for sympathy were met by the proscriptionists with the stern\r\nreminder: “The exclusive party who were never known to tolerate any\r\npolitical opponent raise and reiterate the cry of persecution and\r\nproscription at every removal that takes place. They have provoked\r\nretaliation by the most profligate and abandoned course of\r\nelectioneering; the most unheard-of calumny and abuse was heaped upon\r\nthe candidate of the people; he was called by every epithet that could\r\ndesignate crime, and the amiable partner of his bosom was dragged before\r\nthe people as worse than a convicted felon. What sympathy do men of such\r\na party deserve when complaining that the places which they have abused\r\nare given to others?”[193]\r\n\r\nA dark picture--and yet only darker than similar pictures in years to\r\nfollow because, in 1829, the policy was new and caught the\r\noffice-holders unprepared. So gloomy has the picture been painted that\r\nthe student of the times is prepared to learn of a general massacre of\r\nthe placemen. There was no such massacre--no such massacre as followed\r\nthe election of Lincoln. One is prepared to hear that all the enemies of\r\nJackson were driven from office, but, as a matter of fact, the majority\r\nof the Federal office-holders during his régime were unmolested. This\r\ncould not be said of Roosevelt’s Administration, nor of Cleveland’s. The\r\nexact number of removals during the first year of Jackson’s\r\nAdministration cannot be determined with precision. Schouler,[194] while\r\nmaking no attempt definitely to fix the number, says that “some have\r\nplaced the number as high as two thousand.” In view of the evidence of\r\ncontemporaries available, it does seem that a fairly accurate idea\r\nshould be obtained. It is interesting to observe in this connection that\r\nwhile Jackson’s enemies were dealing in sweeping generalities, his\r\ndefenders were furnishing figures.\r\n\r\nAnd among the defenders none is more reliable than Thomas H. Benton,\r\nwhose veracity or personal honesty has never been impeached or\r\nquestioned, and he tells us[195] that there were whole classes of\r\noffice-holders that were not molested; that those whose functions were\r\nof a judicial nature were not disturbed, and that in the departments at\r\nWashington a majority remained opposed to Jackson through his two\r\nAdministrations. More important still--he tells us that Jackson not only\r\nleft a majority of his enemies in office, but that in some instances he\r\nactually reappointed personal and political enemies where they were\r\n“especially efficient officers.” And he lays stress upon the point that\r\nwhere men, who had bitterly fought Jackson in the election, were not\r\nreappointed, a hue and cry was raised that they had been denied a\r\nright. Corroborating this, we have the evidence of Amos Kendall,[196]\r\nwho wrote, after the Administration had been in power a year and a half:\r\n“He [Jackson] is charged with having turned out of office all who were\r\nopposed to him, when a majority of the office-holders in Washington are\r\nknown to be in favor of his rivals. In that city the removals have been\r\nbut one seventh of those in office, and most of them for bad conduct and\r\ncharacter. In the Post-Office Department, toward which have been\r\ndirected the heaviest complaints, the removals have been only about one\r\nsixteenth; in the whole Government, one eleventh.” And to the evidence\r\nof both Benton and Kendall, either one of whom would have been incapable\r\nof deliberate falsehood, we may add the less reliable, because more\r\nprejudiced, evidence of Isaac Hill, given in a public speech at Concord\r\nin the late summer of 1829. “It is worthy of observation,” he said,\r\n“that at least two thirds of the offices of profit at the seat of the\r\nNational Government, after the removals thus far made, are still held by\r\npersons who were opposed to the election of General Jackson.”[197] A\r\nmore detailed study of the removals actually made show that, while there\r\nwere 8600 post-offices in 1829, less than 800 postmasters were removed,\r\nand these, largely, in the more important centers, leaving 7800\r\nundisturbed.\r\n\r\nOne of the most serious charges against Jackson in connection with these\r\nremovals is that he practiced duplicity, reassuring a trembling\r\noffice-holder one day only to remove him, without warning, on the next;\r\nand this story is based upon what the officer in charge of Indian\r\naffairs under Adams declares to have been his personal experience.\r\nAccording to his story, Eaton, his superior officer, suggested that he\r\nshould see the President to meet some charges that had been made against\r\nhim; that on visiting Jackson he had made a solemn denial, satisfied the\r\nPresident, and been presented by him to the members of his household;\r\nthat on the next day a gentleman entered the Indian Office, and, after\r\nlooking around, explained that the place had been offered him by the\r\nPresident that morning, but that he did not intend to accept; that the\r\nposition was afterwards offered to others, and that the dismissal\r\nfinally reached him in Philadelphia while there on official business.\r\nThis places Jackson in a sinister light; but our commissioner adds, that\r\none close to the Administration said: “Why, sir, everybody knows your\r\nqualifications for the place, but General Jackson has been long\r\nsatisfied that you are not in harmony with his views in regard to the\r\nIndians.”[198] This raises the question whether a President chosen by\r\nthe people is entitled to his own governmental policies or should be\r\nforced to accept such as may be handed to him by subordinates who\r\nreceived their appointments by preference, and not from the hands of the\r\npeople. That this removal was the President’s own idea may be gathered\r\nfrom the fact that Eaton, Secretary of War, under whom Indian affairs\r\ncame, was not in favor of the dismissal.\r\n\r\nIt is worth recording that Van Buren kept his department comparatively\r\nfree from the spoils idea. But even the most intense partisan of Jackson\r\nwill be hard pressed to find any proper reason for the spiteful recall\r\nof William Henry Harrison from Bogota, where he had just presented his\r\ncredentials as United States Minister to Colombia. This recall was\r\nopposed very earnestly by Postmaster-General Barry, who frankly said to\r\nthe President:\r\n\r\n“If you had seen him as I did on the Thames, you would, I think, let him\r\nalone.”\r\n\r\n“You may be right, Barry,” Jackson replied. “I reckon you are. But thank\r\nGod I didn’t see him there.”[199]\r\n\r\nDark though the picture is from the viewpoint of the civil service\r\nreformer, there is another possible point of view. All the officials\r\ndismissed from places were not high-minded, conscientious public\r\nservants, for among them were numerous criminals. The dismissal of\r\nTobias Watkins, an Adams appointee and a personal friend of the former\r\nPresident, to make place for Amos Kendall, was the occasion for a great\r\noutburst of indignation from the Opposition. Within a month the product\r\nof the spoils system had discovered frauds on the part of the “martyr”\r\nto the amount of more than $7000, and an arrest followed. He was\r\nconvicted and served his time in prison. Nor was that of Watkins an\r\nisolated case. Thus the collector at Buffalo[200] had procured false\r\nreceipts for money never paid and was given credit at the Treasury; the\r\ncollector at Key West[201] had permitted an unlawful trade between Cuba\r\nand Florida; the collector at Bath, Maine,[202] was dismissed for\r\npersonally using $56,315 of the public funds; the collector at\r\nPortsmouth[203] was shown to have engaged in smuggling; the collector at\r\nSt. Marks[204] was shown to have been plundering live-oak from the\r\npublic lands; the collector at Petersburg[205] had used $24,857 of the\r\npublic money; the collector at Perth Amboy[206] had made false returns,\r\nappropriated to his own use $88,000 of the public money, and fled to\r\nCanada; the collector at Elizabeth City, North Carolina,[207] had\r\nconverted $32,791 to his personal use and joined the other “martyr” to\r\nthe spoils system on Canadian soil.[208] In brief, the introduction of\r\nthe spoils system had resulted, in eighteen months, in the uncovering of\r\npeculations in the Treasury Department alone of more than $280,000 by\r\nmen whose dismissal from office had called forth the unmeasured\r\ndenunciation of Jackson’s enemies, and it is manifestly unfair to\r\nwithhold these facts while placing emphasis upon the “dismissal of\r\ncollector to make way for Jackson’s henchmen.”\r\n\r\nThus, throughout the spring and summer of 1829, the President and his\r\nCabinet were bored, harassed, and tortured with importunities for place,\r\ndenounced as ingrates because they left any of the enemies in office,\r\nand damned by the enemy for every dismissal that was made.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe spring and summer was the time of the Red Terror.\r\n\r\nThe White Terror of retaliation began with the meeting of the hostile\r\nSenate in December.\r\n\r\nThe enemies of Jackson sought the earliest possible opportunity to\r\ndenounce the wholesale dismissals, and the brilliant orators of the\r\nOpposition in the House made intemperate attacks, while in the Senate\r\nWebster spoke against the policy of proscription, without, however,\r\nadopting the absurd position that the President did not possess the\r\nconstitutional power.[209] The early part of the session was given over\r\nto denunciations of the removals, and to a frankly hostile scrutiny, on\r\nthe part of the Senate, of all nominations requiring confirmation. It\r\nforeshadowed the bitter party battles of the next eight years by\r\nrejecting the nominations of some of Jackson’s most ardent supporters in\r\nthe campaign, and by taking the ridiculous position that journalists\r\nshould be excluded from appointive office. This proscription, or\r\nmassacre of the editors, was aimed at men, comparatively new to public\r\nlife, who were speedily to develop into the most brilliant and sagacious\r\nof the Jacksonian leaders. Long and acrimonious executive sessions\r\nbecame the rule of the Senate. In some instances, action upon\r\nnominations was postponed for months under provocative circumstances\r\nthat were not lost upon the fighting figure at the other end of the\r\nAvenue. The charge was made that a number of the President’s nominees\r\nwere “vicious characters.” It was in the early days of this session that\r\na comparatively new Senator, elected upon the supposition that he would\r\nsupport the President and his policies, and destined to be the only\r\nmember of the Senate to realize personally upon that body’s venomous\r\nhostility to the Administration, stepped forth to organize and direct\r\nthe fight against the confirmation of nominees in whom the President was\r\ndeeply interested. John Tyler led the first onslaught on the\r\nAdministration.\r\n\r\nIt is important to pause to contemplate Tyler’s character and career,\r\nbecause he typifies those Democrats who were so soon to enter into\r\ncoöperation with the Whigs in opposition, and because history has been\r\nunjust in underestimating both his capacity and courage. We shall find\r\nhim pursuing Jackson throughout the greater part of his Presidency, and\r\npaying the penalty to the people with a manliness which found little\r\nemulation among men to whom history has been more gracious.\r\n\r\nJohn Tyler was the scion of a family distinguished in law and in\r\npolitics. His father was a fine Revolutionary figure, and one of the\r\nfirst lawyers in Virginia. He inherited his father’s ability,\r\npredilections, and prejudices. Within three months after his admission\r\nto the bar, he was employed in every important case in the county, and\r\nwhen, at the age of twenty-seven, he abandoned his practice to enter\r\nCongress, his income was $2000 a year, which was $1300 more than\r\nWebster’s at the same age.[210] On reaching Washington, he was cordially\r\nwelcomed by the Madisons into the White House circle. He was fond of the\r\nsociety of the President’s house, disliked the French cooking, but found\r\nconsolation in the excellent champagne of which he was very fond.[211]\r\nHe found Clay, with whom he was to be associated in the fights against\r\nJackson, in the Speaker’s chair, and fell under the spell of his\r\nfascination. It was then, too, that he formed his intense admiration for\r\nCalhoun.\r\n\r\nHis hostility to Jackson and Jacksonian methods was first manifested in\r\nhis support of the resolutions censuring the General for his course in\r\nFlorida. There is no doubt that at this time he had formed a deep-seated\r\nprejudice against the military hero. “We are engaged with Jackson and\r\nthe President,” he wrote home at the time. “I do not hesitate to say\r\nthat the constitutional powers of the House of Representatives have been\r\nviolated in the capture and detention of Pensacola and the Barancas;\r\nthat Jackson overstepped his orders; and that the President has\r\nimproperly approved his proceedings, and that the whole are\r\nculpable.”[212] But there was a more powerful and less personal reason\r\nfor his enmity to the Jackson Administration, which developed during\r\nthis period. He had already become a sectionalist. Like Calhoun in later\r\nlife, and Webster in 1820, he began to sense a struggle between the\r\nsections over the balance of power. Thus early he commenced to question\r\nthe permanency of the Union. In the Missouri fight, in a strong speech\r\nagainst the restriction of slavery, he alone, among all participating on\r\nhis side, advanced the proposition that the Congress possessed no\r\nconstitutional power to pass a law prohibiting slavery in the\r\nTerritories.[213] We find him writing[214] that “men talk of the\r\ndissolution of the Union with perfect nonchalance and indifference.”\r\nWhen, in his thirty-first year, he voluntarily retired to private life\r\nto retrieve his fortunes, he had made an impression so profound that it\r\nwas predicted that he would rise to high station.[215]\r\n\r\nWhen in 1827 he became a candidate for the Senate against the brilliant\r\nand vitriolic John Randolph of Roanoke, we find the elements working\r\nthat were to ripen him for the break with the Jackson Administration,\r\nand for association with Clay’s party of incongruities and nondescripts.\r\nAfter the inauguration of Adams, he had written Clay commending his\r\naction in throwing his support to the Puritan, assuring him of his\r\ncontempt for the “bargain” story, and unnecessarily adding a fling at\r\nJackson: “I do not believe that the sober and reflecting people of\r\nVirginia would have been so far dazzled by military renown as to have\r\nconferred their suffrage upon a mere soldier--one acknowledged on every\r\nhand to be of little value as a civilian.”[216] When Randolph so\r\nviciously attacked Adams and Clay on the “bargain” story, Tyler became\r\nhis most uncompromising foe. In some manner his letter to Clay found its\r\nway into the newspapers, resulting in much feeling, letter-writing,\r\ncharges and counter-charges and journalizing, and the supporters of\r\nTyler interpreted the use of the letter as an attempt to coerce him into\r\nsupport of Jackson in 1828. If such was the purpose, it failed. He was\r\nelected without having pledged himself, and at a complimentary dinner\r\nafter his election, he referred to Jackson in a sneering fashion.\r\n\r\nAnd now we begin to understand the underlying causes that took Tyler and\r\nother Southern Democrats out of the party and into the Whig ranks during\r\nthe Jackson period. On reaching Washington in December, 1827, we find\r\nhim writing to a correspondent: “My hopes are increased from the\r\nfollowing fact ... that in the nature of things, General Jackson must\r\nsurround himself by a Cabinet composed of men advocating, to a great\r\nextent, the doctrines so dear to us. Pass them in review before\r\nyou--Clinton, Van Buren, Tazewell, Cheves, Macon, P. P. Barbour, men\r\nwho, in the main, concur with us in sentiment. Furthermore, General\r\nJackson will have to encounter a strong opposition. He will require an\r\nactive support at our hands. Should he abuse Virginia by setting at\r\nnought her political sentiments, he will find her at the head of the\r\nopposition, and he will probably experience the fate of J. Q. A.”[217]\r\nThe Cabinet, when announced, does not seem to have satisfied him,\r\nalbeit Van Buren, of whose views on slavery extension he appears to have\r\nbeen misinformed, was a member. The presence of Berrien and Branch\r\nought, perhaps, to have reassured him, but they were a minority, and\r\nthey did not satisfy Calhoun, of whom they were devoted disciples.\r\n\r\nThus, from the very beginning of the Jackson régime, Tyler was\r\nsuspicious, and ripe for the Opposition. In the spoils system he found a\r\npretext for dissatisfaction, and he proceeded to develop this into a\r\nrather petty persecution. It would be a mistake to underrate the effect\r\nof his opposition. He was highly respected by his colleagues. His\r\ndignity, courtliness, urbanity, and ease gave him a certain social\r\nprestige. He was an interesting and likable companion, and his polished\r\nconversation had impelled an English novelist[218] to describe it as\r\nsuperior to that of any one he had met in America. His appearance was\r\nnot against him. Tall and slender, of patrician mould, his Roman nose,\r\nfirm mouth, broad and lofty brow, and honest blue eyes combined to give\r\nhim a distinction that marked him in an assembly. He was not a mere\r\nprofessional politician of a type to be developed later in the Republic.\r\nHis letters to his daughter[219] concerning her studies, on poetry,\r\nfiction, and history, denote a discriminating student and lover of\r\nliterature. It was this occasional detachment from the political world\r\nwhich made it possible for him, during the famous debate on the Foot\r\nResolution, to entertain himself in the Senate Chamber in the reading of\r\nMoore’s “Life of Byron.” We shall now observe him launch the White\r\nTerror against the Red.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nAmong the nominations, mostly for comparatively minor positions, sent to\r\nthe Senate by Jackson were those of a “batch of editors.”[220] Strangely\r\nenough, this seems to have rather affronted the somewhat ponderous\r\ndignity of that body. So strongly did it then impress the Senate that it\r\nhas made an ugly impression upon a number of historians. Even\r\nSchouler[221] is distressed to find so many mere “press writers” on the\r\nlist. Whether the fact that they were mere editors was enough to make\r\nthem “infamous characters,” we are left to conjecture. The secret of the\r\nstrange antipathy to a class long conceded to be among the most\r\ninfluential of any nation is probably to be found in the fact that until\r\nthis time the lawyers were conceded a monopoly in public station. There\r\nwas a reason for Jackson’s change of policy, and it grew out of the\r\norganization of party and the democratization of government. Unlike his\r\npredecessors, he had not depended for support, nor did he expect to look\r\nexclusively for support to the professional politicians and the wealthy.\r\nAs a candidate his appeal had been--for the first time in American\r\nhistory--to the people. As a President he proposed to look to the same\r\nquarter. With the people actually established as the ultimate power in\r\nthe State, according to the theory of American institutions, he was not\r\nunmindful of the necessity of reaching the people with his case. He was\r\nthe first President fully to appreciate the power of the press. He could\r\nsee no reason why men capable of presenting and popularizing a policy or\r\nprinciple should be excluded from the privilege of helping put it in\r\noperation.\r\n\r\nIn the campaign of 1828 he had been opposed by the greater portion of\r\nthe press, but he had found champions--men of capacity and talent, who\r\nhad fought the good fight for him, and not without effect. The\r\nassumption that all these men were bribed by the promise of place would\r\nbe a violent one indeed. And the “batch of editors” whose names he sent\r\nto the Senate were men who had long been attached to the cause that\r\nJackson personified. Some had more recently allied themselves with the\r\ncause, but in every instance there was a sound reason for the change of\r\nfront, and in these cases it does not appear that they had met the\r\nPresident in the campaign or had any expectations.\r\n\r\nAnd these men, having received recess appointments, were at their posts\r\nor on their way. Those already at their posts had given ample proof of\r\ntheir capacity. One, against whom considerable bitterness was felt, had\r\nspeedily uncovered the peculations of a highly respectable predecessor\r\nwho was not a “press writer,” and that gentleman was languishing in the\r\npenitentiary. The Senate, apparently, did not consider this a service to\r\nthe State worthy of reward. While there can be no doubt that the\r\npartisan enemies of Jackson were delighted at the opportunity personally\r\nto affront him, and while it is certain that Clay’s friends were anxious\r\nto punish one, and Adams’s friends to humiliate another, the actual\r\nconspiracy to defeat the confirmation of the editors originated with\r\nJohn Tyler, in close coöperation with Senator Tazewell of Virginia--who\r\nwas still smarting under his defeat in the contest with Van Buren for\r\nthe secretaryship of State.\r\n\r\nThe editors who thus fell under the haughty displeasure of the Senate\r\nwere Major Henry Lee, James B. Gardner, Moses Dawson, Mordecai M. Noah,\r\nAmos Kendall, and Isaac Hill.\r\n\r\nCharges of a personal nature were made against Lee, who had been\r\nappointed consul-general to Algiers. He was a half-brother of Robert E.\r\nLee and a man of brilliant parts. During the campaign he had lived with\r\nJackson at the Hermitage “writing for his election some of the finest\r\ncampaign papers ever penned in this country.”[222] One who saw him there\r\nat the time has recorded his impressions. “He was not handsome, as his\r\nhalf-brother, Robert E. Lee, but rather ugly in face--a mouth without a\r\nline of the bow of Diana about it, and nose, not clean-cut and classic,\r\nbut rather meaty, and, if we may use the word, ‘blood meaty’; but he\r\nwas one of the most attractive men in conversation we ever listened\r\nto.”[223] He had served in the Virginia House of Delegates with Tyler,\r\nand had been a college mate. “Moreover,” writes Tyler, “I regarded him\r\nas a man of considerable intellectual attainments and of a high order of\r\ntalent.”[224] But this did not operate in his favor. He had assisted in\r\nthe writing of Jackson’s inaugural address, and is said to have been\r\nmostly responsible for its literary form. The fact that his morals were\r\nnot considered impeccable was sufficient as a pretext, and the news of\r\nhis rejection reached him in Paris, where he died. Tyler afterwards\r\nprotested that he had found it painful to vote against his confirmation,\r\nand had expressed his opinion of Lee’s “innocence of certain more\r\naggravated additions to the charge under which he labored.”\r\n\r\nIsaac Hill, of the “New Hampshire Patriot,” was easily slaughtered on\r\nthe ground that during the campaign he had “slandered Mrs. Adams.” In\r\naddition to the publication of his paper, the most vigorous and clever\r\nJacksonian organ in New England, he conducted a publishing house, and\r\nhis offense lay in having published a book in which Mrs. Adams was\r\ndescribed as an “English woman” with little sympathy for American\r\ninstitutions. The hollowness of this excuse is evident in the fact that\r\nseveral Senators who had been shocked at this offense had regaled\r\ndrawing-rooms with jokes of Mrs. Jackson’s pipe, and on Mrs. Eaton’s\r\nbeing a proper “lady in waiting” for the President’s wife since “birds\r\nof a feather flock together.”[225] The real reason for his rejection was\r\nthat he had incurred the bitter enmity of the Opposition by his telling\r\nparagraphs during the campaign. Immediately after his rejection, two\r\nSenators hastened to the home of John Quincy Adams with the news, and\r\nthe old man made the comment in his diary that night that Hill “was the\r\neditor of the ‘New Hampshire Patriot,’ one of the most slanderous\r\nnewspapers against the late Administration, and particularly against me,\r\nin the country.”\r\n\r\nMordecai M. Noah, editor of the “National Advocate” of New York City,\r\nappointed surveyor and inspector of the port of New York, appears to\r\nhave tickled the risibles of the Senators of the Opposition, though his\r\ndistinguished career entitles him to the respect of posterity. One\r\nimportant and memorable service to the Nation should have made him\r\nimmune from the common hate. Sixteen years before he had been sent as\r\nconsul to Tunis with a special mission to Algiers. We had been paying an\r\nannual tribute to Algiers for the privilege of navigating the\r\nMediterranean, and Noah, the journalist, had denounced the practice and\r\ndeclared that the money could be better spent in the building of\r\nwarships. He succeeded on his Algerian mission in ransoming American\r\nprisoners who were being held in slavery, but such was the bigotry of\r\nthe time that, after his work was done, he was recalled on the flimsy\r\npretense that his Jewish religion was impossible in Tunis. At the time\r\nhe was honored by Jackson, he was not only distinguished by his public\r\nservice, but because of his journalistic genius, and he had written his\r\n“Travels in England, France, Spain, and the Barbary States.” He deserves\r\nhis place in Morais’s “Eminent Israelites of the 19th Century.” But he\r\nhad rendered valuable service to Jackson in the campaign, and the\r\nbigoted members of the Senate rejected him with much hilarity.\r\n\r\nThe first setback the Opposition received came in the consideration of\r\nthe nomination of Amos Kendall, of the “Kentucky Argus.” He had, at the\r\ntime, served for months with marked ability as auditor of the Treasury,\r\nrooting out old and vicious practices, uncovering the crimes of his\r\npredecessor, but he had left the camp of Clay to do yeoman service for\r\nJackson, and that was quite enough. Adams himself was deeply interested\r\nin his humiliation. In the midst of the campaign he had been consulted\r\nby Clay touching upon “testimony given by Amos Kendall before the Senate\r\nof Kentucky intended to support charges against Mr. Clay of corrupt\r\nbargaining with me”; and, on Clay’s representation, no doubt, describes\r\nthe editor as “one of those authors to let, whose profligacy is the\r\nchild of his poverty.” But the vote on Kendall was a tie, and Calhoun\r\ncast the deciding vote in his favor.\r\n\r\nTyler was delighted with his work. “On Monday we took the printers in\r\nhand,” he wrote. “Kendall was saved by the casting vote of the Vice\r\nPresident.... Hendricks [Indiana], who was supported by the last\r\nAdministration, was induced to vote for him and in that way he was\r\nsaved. Out of those presented to the Senate, but two squeezed through,\r\nand that with the whole power of the Government here thrown in the\r\nscale.”[226] Kendall tells an interesting story which shows that the\r\nfriends of Calhoun were quietly at work to convince the rejected editors\r\nthat their humiliation had been brought about through the secret\r\ninfluence of Van Buren. Even then the Little Magician, as Van Buren was\r\ncalled, was considered the greatest obstacle in the way of the South\r\nCarolinian’s progress toward the White House, and it was the evident\r\npurpose to send the editors, miserable “press writers” though they were,\r\nback to their papers to fight the aspirations of Van Buren. Before the\r\nvote was taken on Kendall, he was approached by Duff Green, of the\r\n“National Telegraph,” Calhoun’s organ, and assured that the Van Buren\r\ninfluence was responsible for the fight against him. This aroused the\r\ncuriosity of the clever Kendall, who “had never heard of such\r\ninfluence,” and he instantly surmised the meaning of the message. Thus,\r\nwhen Green, predicting his rejection, suggested that the Kentuckian\r\ncould return to the “Argus,” the latter replied that he would remain in\r\nWashington in that event.\r\n\r\nThe effect of these rejections on Jackson was like a slap in the face.\r\nIt aroused all the lion in his nature. He had grown fond of the editors\r\nwho had so vigorously fought his battles, and his heart was set on their\r\nreward. It was the Senate’s first challenge, and it was instantly\r\naccepted. It was clear that nothing could be done for Lee, where the\r\nvote was unanimous, but Jackson decided to renominate Noah, and we find\r\nTyler writing to Tazewell: “The President this morning renominated Noah.\r\nThis is a prelude to Hill’s renomination. Your presence, I apprehend,\r\nwould be immaterial, as the result of any vote upon these subjects would\r\nnot be varied. Monday is fixed for the consideration of Noah’s\r\ncase.”[227] On the second attempt, Noah was confirmed, like Kendall,\r\nwith the casting vote of Calhoun.\r\n\r\nBut the President had other plans for his favorite, Hill, over whose\r\nsharp retorts the General had so heartily chuckled during the campaign.\r\nWebb, the editor of the “Courier and Enquirer” of New York, denounced in\r\nhis paper the Senate’s rejection of Hill. “Isaac Hill,” he wrote, “is a\r\nprinter and was the editor of the ‘New Hampshire Patriot.’ He was always\r\nthe friend of his country and its republican institutions, and when that\r\ncountry, during the late war, was about to be sold by traitors to the\r\nenemy; when the war was declared wicked and unjustifiable, and the\r\nHartford Convention meditated the formation of a separate treaty with\r\nEngland, his voice was heard in the Granite State and in the mountains\r\nof Vermont, animating the people and arousing them to a just sense of\r\ntheir danger, and the blessings of freedom. He was a thorn in the side\r\nof the Tories, and though living in the hotbed of the Opposition, he\r\npursued his course fearlessly, independently, and successfully.” Writing\r\nfrom Jefferson Barracks, General Henry Leavenworth entered his protest,\r\na non-partisan one: “Isaac Hill with his ‘New Hampshire Patriot’ did\r\nmore than any one man known to me to put down the ‘peace societies’\r\nduring the war,” he wrote, and he described enlistments under him\r\nfollowing Hill’s patriotic exhortations.\r\n\r\nIt is more than probable that these protests were not uninspired, and\r\nthat the fine Italian hand of Amos Kendall, who had already become the\r\nmanagerial genius of the Administration, was in them. Certain it is that\r\nthe most effective move was that of Kendall in writing to the Democracy\r\nof New Hampshire that the President “has entire confidence in Mr. Hill\r\nand looks upon his rejection as a blow aimed at himself,” and putting it\r\nup to the legislature to “wipe away the stigma cast upon this just and\r\ntrue man, by the unjust and cruel vote of the Senate.” The New Hampshire\r\nDemocrats understood, and a little later Isaac Hill walked down the\r\naisle of the Senate that had humiliated and rejected him to take the\r\noath as a Senator of the United States.\r\n\r\nThus the Senate’s fight against Jackson began at the earliest possible\r\nmoment. Clay had begun his denunciations of the Administration before it\r\nwas three weeks old; and the Senate sought an opportunity personally to\r\naffront the President before he had announced a policy or a programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nJACKSON BREAKS WITH CALHOUN\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe definite break between Calhoun and Jackson was one of the most\r\ndramatic and far-reaching in its political effects of any similar\r\nquarrel in American history. It furnished Clay with new material for the\r\nbuilding of his party. It decisively committed the party of Jackson to\r\nthe defense of the Union. It eliminated Calhoun from the list of\r\npresidential possibilities, dropped the curtain on the South Carolinian\r\nthat the Nation had known for two decades, and raised it on another with\r\nwhom the world is well acquainted. It divided his life into two distinct\r\nparts. It made Martin Van Buren President.\r\n\r\nThe Calhoun who was to become one of Clay’s most vituperative and\r\nintemperate lieutenants in the fight against the Administration differs\r\nas radically from the ambitious politician who had intrigued for the\r\nelection of Jackson as the Webster of the Great Debate differed from the\r\nWebster of the Rockingham Resolutions.\r\n\r\nThe greatest biographer of the Carolinian[228] fixes the time that he\r\nbecame the personification of the slavery cause as 1830--the date of the\r\nquarrel--and says that “up to that time he is, in spite of his\r\nuncommonly brilliant career, only an able politician of the higher and\r\nnobler order, having many peers and even a considerable number of\r\nsuperiors.” Of the three great figures, Clay, Webster, and Calhoun, he\r\nwas admittedly the strongest intellectually, and the one most\r\nunmistakably touched with genius. Nature made him a statesman. Swept\r\ninto Congress on the wave of patriotic enthusiasm following the attack\r\non the Chesapeake, his audacity, independent thinking, militancy, and\r\ngenius combined to place him in the very lead of the party of Young\r\nAmerica that clamored for the War of 1812. He sounded the first clear\r\nofficial war note in his report on that part of Madison’s Message\r\ndealing with our relations with England; and after the delivery of his\r\nfirst war speech one of the leading editors of the day hailed “this\r\nyoung Carolinian as one of the master spirits who stamp their names upon\r\nthe age in which they live.”[229] In his haughty assumption of equality\r\nwith the oldest and most experienced members of the Congress, he\r\nsuggests the younger Pitt. His war speeches were classics of\r\nargumentation, sober, and yet pulsating with patriotic passion. If any\r\nsectional thought crossed his mind then, it never touched his tongue. He\r\nwas a superb Nationalist--one of the most splendid figures of his time.\r\nSummoned into Monroe’s Cabinet as Secretary of War, he disclosed a high\r\norder of executive as well as legislative ability. Finding the\r\ndepartment in confusion, he brought order out of chaos, and established\r\nsystem. A former officer of the great Napoleon was impressed with the\r\nresemblance between Calhoun’s plan of army organization and that of the\r\nCorsican.[230] Even his friends were agreeably astonished at his\r\naptitude for organzation and general executive duties. And this\r\nfurthered his presidential plans, and a strong party in the Congress\r\nperfected plans to advance him to the White House on the expiration of\r\nMonroe’s term.\r\n\r\nIt is not now fashionable to think of him as a designing and ambitious\r\npolitician, but one of his biographers has commented on his tendency to\r\nstoop “to cover with an approving and admiring smile a resentment which\r\nis lurking in the corner of his heart, and on the other side to break\r\noff all social intercourse with old and highly respected associates,\r\nmerely because others whose services he wished to secure might not like\r\nthese connections.”[231] And yet, despite his efforts, his candidacy\r\nappears to have made no impression upon the country. Among the\r\npublicists he was strong; but the people were not impressed. He was the\r\noriginal “young man’s candidate,” but this weakened him among the older\r\nand more important leaders. “His age, or rather his youth,” wrote\r\none,[232] “at the present moment is a formidable objection to his\r\nelevation to the chair.” Nevertheless, placing his reliance on the\r\nyounger element, he pushed on. Even in Massachusetts he was charged with\r\nhaving “newspapers set up” to support him.[233] Certain it is that\r\nWebster favored his election as long as it seemed possible of\r\nachievement, and when failure there seemed certain, the greatest of his\r\nfuture rivals earnestly urged his election to the Vice-Presidency.[234]\r\nTo the latter position he was elected through a combination of the\r\nfriends of Adams and Jackson.\r\n\r\nAnd now we find the presidential fever consuming him. He becomes the\r\npractical, scheming, not overly scrupulous politician--a rôle he is not\r\npopularly supposed to have ever filled. From the very beginning he set\r\nto work to undermine the Administration of his chief. His apologists\r\nexplain that when the “bargain” story was advanced, he was forced to\r\nchoose between the two factions that had combined to elect him, and\r\npreferred to go with the Jackson forces.[235] Whatever his motive, he\r\nentered into no half-hearted opposition. This notable activity against\r\nAdams and in favor of Jackson has been ascribed to a presumptive\r\npremonition that the latter was certain to reach the Presidency, and, in\r\nview of Jackson’s assurance that he would be satisfied with one term,\r\nCalhoun calculated that the defeat of Adams would shorten his period of\r\nwaiting by four years.[236] So ardently was he panting for the\r\nPresidency at this time that he summoned his friends to assist in the\r\nestablishment of a paper, impatiently brushed aside the objections as to\r\ncost, and calling Duff Green to the editorship of the “National\r\nTelegraph,” created the most powerful party organ that had existed in\r\nthis country up to that time.[237] Less than a year after Adams’s\r\ninauguration, Calhoun was actively organizing for his defeat. We find\r\nhim inviting a Philadelphian to his chamber in the Capitol to urge him\r\nto coöperate with the Opposition party on the ground that “because of\r\nthe manner in which it came into power it must be defeated at all\r\nhazards, regardless of its measures.”[238] This insistence on the defeat\r\nof the Administration, “regardless of its measures,” was the reasoning\r\nof an ambitious politician, none too scrupulous, in a pinch, in his\r\nmethods. The rest is known--how Calhoun threw his influence to Jackson\r\nin 1828, and was reflected to the Vice-Presidency with the hero of the\r\nHermitage. Close students of the period are now convinced that\r\npreliminary to this alliance an agreement had been made that Calhoun was\r\nto succeed to the Presidency after four years.\r\n\r\nAt this time he was in the full maturity of his wonderful power, and the\r\nfuture must have seemed secure. Quincy, who saw him about this time,\r\nfound him “a striking looking man, with thick black hair brushed back\r\ndefiantly,” and he comments on Calhoun’s policy of cultivating and\r\nfascinating all young men visiting the National capital.[239] The world\r\nis too familiar with the tragic features of the great Carolinian to\r\nrequire a description. The rugged carving, the low broad brow, the spare\r\nframe almost amounting to attenuation, the penetrating gaze of the\r\n“glorious pair of yellow-brown shining eyes,” the bushy brows and the\r\nsunken sockets--Calhoun looked unlike any other man in history.[240] He\r\nwas a commanding figure at the time of the quarrel which was to change\r\nthe entire course of his life, and to alter his political character.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nWe have seen that Calhoun was annoyed with Jackson over matters of\r\npatronage, but the development of the quarrel to the breaking point is\r\nto be traced in the story of a debate and two dinners.\r\n\r\nWhile it has not been customary to attach any party significance to the\r\nWebster-Hayne debate, it was conducted along party lines and was a party\r\nbattle. To such a seasoned observer of parliamentary fights as Thomas H.\r\nBenton, it was little more than a party skirmish.[241] Even Webster, at\r\nthe time, evidently looked upon Hayne’s assault upon him as political in\r\nits character. Some time before he had sent Senator White of Florida to\r\nCalhoun to warn him that by permitting his friends to attack New\r\nEngland, he was playing into the hands of Van Buren, who would capture\r\nNew England States that would otherwise go to the South Carolinian. And\r\nCalhoun, no less alive to the political significance of the promised\r\nfight, had, according to White’s story to Adams, been impressed. “He\r\nsaid Calhoun seemed to be considerably at a loss what to do,” wrote\r\nAdams at the time; “that he did not know what things were coming to;\r\nthat he had no feeling of unfriendliness to me, and would by now have\r\nvisited me but for fear of being misrepresented; that if I had consulted\r\nhim four years ago, and not have appointed Clay Secretary of State, I\r\nshould now have been President of the United States.”[242] This\r\npurported warning of Webster to Calhoun is given color by the former’s\r\naction during his great speech, in turning his fine black eyes upon the\r\nlatter, in the chair, while quoting:\r\n\r\n    “A barren sceptre in their gripe\r\n     Thence to be wrenched by an unlineal hand,\r\n     No son of their’s succeeding”\r\n\r\n--a prophecy said to have caused Calhoun to “change expression and show\r\nsome agitation.”[243]\r\n\r\nWhether the attack on Webster and New England was conceived for the\r\npurpose of serving a party or sectional end, the records show that the\r\nAdministration leaders who participated in the debate, Grundy, White,\r\nand Livingston, followed the Webster-Hayne exchange with elaborate\r\nindictments of New England Federalism, and John Forsyth, the real floor\r\nleader of the Administration, while contributing little to the\r\ndiscussion, was notably busy upon the floor. That the party phase was\r\nuppermost in the minds of the politicians and the press immediately\r\nfollowing the verbal duel of the giants may be deduced from the nature\r\nof the press comments. One paper, having a correspondent at the capital,\r\nsummed up the result: “The opposition party generally contend that Mr.\r\nWebster overthrew Mr. Hayne; while, on the other hand, the result is\r\ntriumphantly hailed by the friends of the Administration as a decisive\r\nvictory over the eastern giant.”[244] And in keeping with the theory\r\nthat the mass attack on New England Federalism was to capture that\r\nsection for the Administration,[245] we find the speech of Hayne being\r\nextensively circulated over the New England States. There can be no\r\ndoubt that Webster literally dragged in the really great issue of the\r\nUnion, that Hayne was forced to accept that diversion, and by so doing\r\ngave to the debate its immortal character. Jackson was delighted with\r\nHayne’s first speech, and interested in the second, but on a more\r\nmature consideration Webster’s glowing defense of the Union went home to\r\nthe old patriot at the White House. It is because of the effect of the\r\ndebate upon Jackson’s Administration, and not merely because it occurred\r\nduring his Presidency, that we cannot dismiss it as remote from the\r\nparty politics of the time.\r\n\r\nIt should be borne in mind that the Daniel Webster who emerged from the\r\ndebate was not the same public character who had entered it. By that\r\nepochal utterance he obliterated the one vulnerable point in his\r\ncareer--for the Daniel Webster of 1829 was vulnerable. He entered\r\npolitics in New Hampshire as a Federalist--“liberal Federalist,” to use\r\nthe phrase of his biographer.[246] Notwithstanding this “liberality,” he\r\nwas to become considerably smirched by party loyalty during the war with\r\nEngland. This war was the occasion for his first public utterance, when,\r\non July 4, 1812, he bitterly denounced the war with true Federalistic\r\nfervor at Portsmouth. This speech, printed and circulated for propaganda\r\npurposes against the war, ran into two editions, and led to his\r\nselection as a delegate to the notorious Rockingham County mass meeting.\r\nHere it fell to him to prepare the address known to history as the\r\n“Rockingham Memorial” to which the advocates of the sinister doctrine of\r\nNullification pointed approvingly up to the Civil War. The notoriety of\r\nthis document resulted in his election to Congress, where his record was\r\neverything it should not have been.\r\n\r\nHis first move was to heckle the President by calling upon him for\r\ninformation as to the time and manner of the repeal of the French\r\ndecrees--which was in line with his previous denunciation of France. The\r\nenemies of the War of 1812 were bitter against the French, just as the\r\nenemies of the World War, over a century later, were bitter against the\r\nEnglish. And while his country was at war with a powerful foe, he voted\r\nagainst taxes necessary for the waging of it; fought the compulsory\r\ndraft of men for the miserable little army on the ground that the States\r\nalone had the right to resort to conscription; and even threatened the\r\ndissolution of the Union with the suggestion that “it would be the\r\nsolemn duty of the State Governments to protect their authority over\r\ntheir own State militia, and to interpose between their citizens and\r\narbitrary power.” He stubbornly resisted the attempt to extend martial\r\nlaw to all citizens suspected of treason; actually declaimed against the\r\nbill to encourage enlistments; opposed the war policy of the war\r\nAdministration and urged a defensive warfare. And, of course, he\r\nintemperately denounced the embargo.\r\n\r\nThis course made him by long odds the most conspicuous Federalist in the\r\nHouse, and while he opposed the Hartford Convention, he does not appear\r\nto have looked upon it as seditious or treasonable, and as late as 1820,\r\nin his Boston speech, utterly ignored by his biographers, he practically\r\nproclaimed the right of secession. In brief, throughout the second war\r\nagainst England he was found just on the safe side of the line of\r\nsedition. His position at the time was notorious, and Isaac Hill, in the\r\n“New Hampshire Patriot,” was openly accusing him of trying to dissolve\r\nthe Union and to array the North against the South.\r\n\r\nThus, the Webster that Hayne assailed had skeletons in his closet. His\r\nreputation as an orator was greater than that of any living American.\r\nBehind him was his Plymouth Oration which had rivaled Washington Irving\r\nas a best seller;[247] his Dartmouth College plea, which had moved John\r\nMarshall to tears; his Bunker Hill Address, which had been read with\r\navidity in England and translated into French; and his plea for Greek\r\nindependence, which had been read all over the world. Such was the\r\nDaniel Webster who was challenged by Hayne--or the Democrats--or the\r\nAdministration.\r\n\r\nRobert Y. Hayne was a knight of Southern chivalry, who in youth, like\r\nthe ancient Greeks and Romans, had studied oratory as an art, from his\r\nfirst boyhood triumph moving with dash and audacity to his destiny, and\r\nat thirty-two entered the Senate of the United States.[248] His\r\nreputation as an orator previous to the great debate promised that the\r\ncontest would not be one-sided. His character as man and publicist\r\ncommanded universal respect and even the affection of political friend\r\nand foe alike.[249] And he entered the contest with one distinct\r\nadvantage over his adversary: there were skeletons in Webster’s closet;\r\nthere were none in Hayne’s.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt but that on the day Hayne opened his attack, he was in\r\nfine fettle. Never had the Senate Chamber presented a more inspiring\r\nscene. Before him, with folded arms, sat the most coveted prey in the\r\ncovey of the Opposition. From the Vice-President’s chair, Calhoun, the\r\ngod of his idolatry, encouraged him with the compliment of a happy\r\nexpression. About him were grouped the prominent “Jackson Senators”\r\nready to encourage him with their approving smiles.[250] There was a\r\ngallant and confident air in the orator as he “dashed into the debate\r\nlike a Mameluke cavalry upon a charge.”[251] In a moment he was in the\r\nfull swing of his eloquence, and, as he poured forth his sarcasm, and\r\nmarshaled his facts against the Federalism of New England, and threw\r\nwide the door revealing the Webster skeletons in the closet, the\r\nrealization was borne to all that they were listening to one of the most\r\neffective speeches ever heard in the Senate. The Democrats were\r\njubilant--the enemy concerned--Webster was a mask, as unresponsive as\r\nthe sphinx. The blows at Federalism--at New England--at Webster, fell\r\nlike the hammer on an anvil. The speaker’s deadly parallel on Webster\r\nand his tariff record was a superb piece of clever oratory. His analysis\r\nof New England Federalism in the War of 1812 was a stinging\r\nindictment--it was a conviction and a sentence.\r\n\r\nThe Democrats and Jackson Senators were naturally delighted. This was a\r\npolitical speech that Hayne was making, and he was crucifying Federalism\r\nand parading the closet skeletons of its greatest living champion, and\r\nshaming the section that refused to be converted to the new faith. And\r\nwhen the orator fell into the trap cleverly prepared for him by Webster,\r\nand, ostentatiously encouraged by Calhoun with numerous notes of\r\nsuggestions sent by the pages from the chair, entered upon his\r\nexposition of the theory of Nullification, it is improbable that the\r\ndelighted Jackson Senators caught the full significance of the\r\ndeparture. Duff Green, in the “National Telegraph,” the Calhoun organ,\r\nthen supporting the Administration, was in a frenzy of delight. Andrew\r\nJackson, who had kept in close touch with the debate, sending Major\r\nLewis daily to the Senate Chamber, and was immensely pleased with the\r\npolitical or party features of the speech, wrote the orator a cordial\r\nletter of congratulation.\r\n\r\nThe depression of the Federalists, the New Englanders, and the\r\nOpposition generally, was correspondingly great. A professional\r\nobserver,[252] writing of the event in later years, tells us that “the\r\nimmediate impression from the speech was most assuredly disheartening to\r\nthe cause Mr. Webster upheld.” And Henry Cabot Lodge accepts the\r\nstatement that “men of the North and of New England could be known in\r\nWashington in those days by their indignant and dejected looks and\r\ndowncast eyes.”[253]\r\n\r\nThe day Webster began his reply was the coldest of the winter, a biting\r\nwind filling the streets with clouds of dust, and Margaret Bayard Smith,\r\nsitting before a blazing fire, and free from the interruption of callers\r\nbecause “almost every one is thronging to the Capitol to hear Mr.\r\nWebster reply to Colonel Hayne’s attack on him and his party,” wrote\r\nregretfully of the growing tendency of women to monopolize the seats\r\nboth in the gallery and upon the floor.[254] The reader is too familiar\r\nwith that splendid oration to justify, for our purposes, any analysis or\r\nextended reference to the substance. His replies to Hayne’s attacks on\r\nthe war policy of the Federalists, and upon his own inconsistencies,\r\nwhile clever, were not, in truth, convincing answers, and it was upon\r\nthese points that the Jackson Senators were centering their attention.\r\nThus it is not remarkable that the full import of his speech was\r\nmomentarily lost upon the heated partisans. Even Benton, refusing to\r\nbelieve that the Union was in danger, or in any way involved in the\r\ndebate, did not care for Webster’s peroration, finding the sentiment\r\nnobly and oratorically expressed, “but too elaborately and too\r\nartistically composed for real grief in the presence of a great\r\ncalamity--of which calamity I saw no sign.”[255] To Benton, the debate\r\nwas a party combat and nothing more. Nor is there anything in the notes\r\nrecorded by Adams to indicate that he was impressed with the Webster\r\nspeech except as a defense of Federalism.[256] The party issue had, for\r\nthe moment, obscured all else. If in Charleston, the home of Hayne,\r\nWebster became the idol of the old Federalists, and of the Democratic\r\nmechanics, Hayne won the affectionate admiration of the merchants of\r\nBoston, who had his speech printed on satin for presentation to\r\nhim.[257] The Democratic members of the Legislature of Maine, thinking\r\nonly of the denunciation of Federalism, ordered two thousand copies\r\npublished and distributed as “a fearless unanswerable defense of the\r\nDemocracy of New England”--showing that the Nullification feature was\r\noverlooked in the party contest involved. Some contemporaries thought\r\nthe battle a draw.\r\n\r\nAnd Jackson? Parton tells us that Major Lewis, who had been stationed in\r\nthe Senate during the debate, on returning from the Capitol after\r\nhearing Webster, found Jackson up and eager for news. On being told that\r\nthe New England orator had made a powerful speech and demolished “our\r\nfriend Hayne,” the old man replied that he “expected it.”[258] A few\r\ndays later the full import of Hayne’s speech must have dawned upon\r\nJackson and his political intimates, and there is significance in the\r\npowerful speech delivered a little later in the debate by Edward\r\nLivingston, Senator from Louisiana, intimate friend of the President,\r\nwho was destined to enter the Cabinet and to frame Jackson’s immortal\r\nchallenge to Nullification. After the speeches of Webster and Hayne,\r\nthat of Livingston stands out as the greatest made during the prolonged\r\ndiscussion. He attempted again to center the fire on Federalism, and in\r\nso doing brilliantly defended the Union against Nullification, and\r\nvigorously defended the Jacksonian policies against the attacks to which\r\nthey had been subjected during the remarkable debate. If the personal\r\nviews of Jackson and the Administration are to be sought in any of the\r\nsenatorial speeches, they will be found, not in the speech of Hayne, but\r\nin that of Livingston, which, for that reason, is entitled to more\r\nconsideration from historians than it has received. We shall now see\r\nthat within two months Jackson was to find a way to say the last word in\r\nthe Great Debate of 1830.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nFor some reason the Nullifiers miscalculated the stern old patriot of\r\nthe While House. Perhaps it was his opposition to the tariff; possibly\r\nhis South Carolina nativity--whatever the cause, the extreme State\r\nRights party claimed him as its own. It is scarcely probable that,\r\nprevious to the Webster-Hayne debate, Jackson had ever given any serious\r\nconsideration to the danger of disunion, and most probable that the\r\nviews advanced by Hayne in the Nullification part of his speech first\r\nimpressed him with the fact that a sinister doctrine, brilliantly\r\nadvanced and powerfully supported, was preparing to challenge the\r\nauthority of the Nation. But he had kept his own counsels. He may have\r\ndiscussed the danger with Livingston or Van Buren, but no public\r\nannouncement of his position had escaped him up to the time of the\r\nJefferson dinner in the April following the Great Debate. This dinner,\r\nif is now reasonable to conclude, had been arranged with a definite\r\nobject in view--to create the impression that, in a contest, the\r\nPresident would be friendly to the doctrine of Calhoun and Hayne. The\r\nsignificance of the selection of Jefferson’s birthday as the occasion\r\nwas not lost upon the President or his Secretary of State. It was the\r\nfirst formal observance of the great Virginian’s natal day, and among\r\nthe leaders in the preparations were some “with whom the Virginia\r\nprinciples of ’98 had, until quite recently, been in very bad\r\nodor.”[259] It was clear to the Red Fox that the intent was “to use the\r\nVirginia model as a mask or stalking horse, rather than as an armor of\r\ndefense.” The plan, as it developed, was to undertake, through various\r\ntoasts and their responses, to associate this doctrine with Jeffersonian\r\nDemocracy. Of the twenty-four toasts, practically every one bore upon\r\nthis subject. The President, Vice-President Calhoun, the Cabinet were to\r\nbe guests.\r\n\r\nIt was a subscription dinner, and outside the conspirators in charge the\r\npurchasers of tickets had no other thought than that it was intended\r\nsolely as a tribute to the memory of the sage of Monticello.\r\n\r\nTalking it over with Van Buren, Jackson soon convinced himself as to the\r\nmotive of the conspirators. By prearrangement, Van Buren met Jackson at\r\nthe White House, in the presence only of Major Donelson, the President’s\r\nsecretary, to determine upon the attitude to be taken and the toasts to\r\nbe proposed. While the Nullifiers were jubilating over the promised\r\nparticipation of the President, he was locked in with his Secretary of\r\nState deliberating on the wisdom of showing by his toast his familiarity\r\nwith the purpose of the conspirators, and his determination to preserve\r\nthe Union at all hazards. The conferees decided upon that aggressive\r\ncourse, and the toasts were framed accordingly.\r\n\r\n“Thus armed,” wrote Van Buren years later, “we repaired to the dinner\r\nwith feelings on the part of the Chief akin to those which would have\r\nanimated his breast if the scene of this preliminary skirmish in defense\r\nof the Union had been the field of battle instead of the festive\r\nboard.”[260] When Benton arrived that night, he found a full assemblage,\r\nwith the guests scattered about in groups excitedly examining the list\r\nof toasts, and discussing their significance. The congressional\r\ndelegation from Pennsylvania, on scenting the conspiracy, left the hall\r\nbefore the dinner began. Many others, not caring to associate themselves\r\nwith such a movement, retired, thus depriving themselves of a triumph.\r\nBut many remained, among them four members of the Cabinet, Van Buren,\r\nEaton, Branch, and Barry. During the toasts, which were so numerous and\r\nlengthy that they required eleven columns in the “National Telegraph,”\r\nJackson sat stern and impassive, betraying nothing of his intention. At\r\nlength, the regular toasts given, the volunteer toasts were called for,\r\nand Jackson rose. As he did so, Van Buren, who was short in stature,\r\nstood on his chair to observe the effect better.[261] Straightening\r\nhimself to his full height, and fixing Calhoun with his penetrating eye,\r\nhe paused a moment, and then, following the hush, proposed the most\r\ndramatic and historical toast in American history:\r\n\r\n“Our Federal Union: It must and shall be preserved.”[262]\r\n\r\nThere was no possible misunderstanding of the meaning. From the time of\r\nthe delivery of the Webster speech the value of the Union had been\r\ndiscussed with a disconcerting freedom of expression. The rumor was\r\nafloat in the capital that Calhoun had sinister designs, and proposed to\r\nplace himself at the head of a disloyal movement of the extreme State\r\nRights men. The toasts of the evening had told their tale of the dinner\r\nconspiracy. And Jackson’s brief, meaningful sentence cut like a knife.\r\nIt was something more than a toast--it was a presidential proclamation.\r\n\r\nWithout a word more, Jackson lifted his glass as a sign that the toast\r\nwas to be drunk standing. Calhoun rose with the rest. “His glass\r\ntrembled in his hand and a little of the amber fluid trickled down the\r\nside.”[263] There was no response. Jackson stood there, silent and\r\nimpassive--clearly the master of the situation. All hilarity had gone.\r\nJackson left his place, and, going to the far end of the room, engaged\r\nBenton in conversation, but not upon the subject of the dinner.\r\n\r\nWhen all were seated, Calhoun, who had remained standing, slowly and\r\nhesitatingly proposed:\r\n\r\n“The Union: next to our liberty, the most dear.”\r\n\r\nThen, after a pause of half a minute, he proceeded in such a fashion as\r\nto leave doubt as to whether the concluding sentence was a part of the\r\ntoast, or a brief speech:\r\n\r\n“May we all remember that it can only be preserved by respecting the\r\nrights of the States, and by distributing equally the benefits and\r\nburdens of the Union.”\r\n\r\nWithin five minutes after Calhoun had resumed his seat, the company of\r\nmore than a hundred had dwindled to thirty--men fled from the room as\r\nfrom the scene of a battle.\r\n\r\nThe story of that Jacksonian toast spread over the country, justifying,\r\nas Benton admits he then realized, the peroration of Webster’s speech,\r\nand proclaiming to the people the existence of a conspiracy against the\r\nUnion, and the determination of Jackson to preserve it at all cost. That\r\ntoast made history. It marked the definite beginning of the\r\nhistory-making quarrel of Jackson and Calhoun, and the beginning of the\r\nexodus from the Democratic or Jacksonian party of the Nullifiers and\r\nDisunionists, who were to be warmly welcomed by Clay into the party he\r\nwas about to create to wage war on the Jackson Administration.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nAnother dinner was to complete the break of Calhoun and Jackson.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1830, President Jackson gave a dinner at the White\r\nHouse in honor of former President Monroe. During the evening, while the\r\nPresident and his predecessor were engaged in animated conversation\r\nconcerning the days when the latter was in the White House and the\r\nformer in the field in Florida, Tench Ringgold, marshal of the District,\r\nturned to Major Lewis with the observation that Calhoun had been an\r\nenemy of the President in relation to his Florida campaign. It was not,\r\nhowever, a revelation to Lewis at the time.\r\n\r\nDuring Jackson’s first successful fight for the Presidency, the\r\nanniversary of the battle of New Orleans was celebrated, with Jackson as\r\nthe guest of honor. James A. Hamilton had participated in the\r\ncelebration as the representative of the Tammany Society of New York;\r\nand, joining the Jackson party at the Hermitage, had accompanied it to\r\nNew Orleans. During the conversation _en route_, there was some\r\ndiscussion of the charges that had been made against Jackson in the\r\npresidential contest of four years before relative to his conduct in the\r\nSeminole War, and the assertion had been made that Crawford, a member of\r\nMonroe’s Cabinet, had urged his arrest. It was expected that a similar\r\nattack would be made in the campaign then beginning. Learning that\r\nHamilton expected to return by way of Georgia, Major Lewis requested him\r\nto visit Crawford, then living in retirement there, and ascertain just\r\nwhat had occurred in the Cabinet meeting. The motive of Lewis was to arm\r\nhimself, if possible, to repel the attack, and to effect a\r\nreconciliation between Jackson and the Georgian. Finding on his arrival\r\nin Georgia that to reach the home of Crawford he would be forced to go\r\nseventy miles out of his way, Hamilton requested John Forsyth to\r\nascertain from Crawford “whether the propriety or necessity for\r\narresting or trying General Jackson was ever presented as a question for\r\nthe deliberation of Mr. Monroe’s Cabinet.”[264] Passing through\r\nWashington on his way home, Hamilton spent two days in the same house\r\nwith Calhoun, and frankly made inquiry of him also. The latter answered\r\nwith an emphatic negative. The impression Hamilton received from the\r\nconversation was that Calhoun had been favorable to Jackson and Crawford\r\nhostile. On reaching New York he wrote Major Lewis of his inability to\r\nsee Crawford and of his conversation with Calhoun. The reply of the\r\nMajor shows conclusively that, up to this time, there was not the\r\nslightest suspicion that Calhoun had been unfriendly to Jackson, and the\r\nsole impression made upon Lewis by Hamilton’s letter was that, since the\r\nsubject of arresting or reprimanding Jackson had not been broached in\r\nthe Cabinet, a grave injustice had been done the Georgian which ought to\r\nbe righted. Soon afterwards, Hamilton heard from Forsyth to the effect\r\nthat Crawford informed him that in a meeting of the Cabinet Calhoun had\r\nurged the propriety of arresting and trying Jackson.[265] Very soon\r\nafter the receipt of Forsyth’s amazing letter, Hamilton received a note\r\nfrom Calhoun, suggesting the impropriety of disclosures as to Cabinet\r\nproceedings and asking that no use be made of his name. Realizing now\r\nthe serious possibilities of a complete airing of the old controversy,\r\nHamilton filed Forsyth’s letter away and mentioned it to no one. For\r\neighteen months this letter was undisturbed. Then, in the autumn of\r\n1829, when Major Lewis was his guest in his New York home, some evil\r\nspirit impelled Hamilton to show the letter to Jackson’s intimate who\r\ndwelt with him in the White House. Lewis made no disclosure until after\r\nthe Monroe dinner. In the meanwhile, as we have seen, the relations\r\nbetween Jackson and Calhoun had become strained, and the Major convinced\r\nhimself that, since the fight was inevitable, his idol should be\r\nfurnished with all available ammunition. In telling him of Ringgold’s\r\nstatement at the dinner, Lewis added that it was supported by the\r\nrevelations of the Forsyth letter, and Jackson demanded the fatal note.\r\n\r\nOn learning of Jackson’s demand, Forsyth took the precaution first to\r\nsend a copy of his letter to Hamilton to Crawford for verification in\r\nwriting, or for such corrections as the facts might necessitate. The\r\nreply, with a minor correction, together with the Forsyth letter to\r\nHamilton, were thereupon turned over to Jackson.\r\n\r\nThe effect on the President was to infuriate him. Setting his jaws, he\r\nwrote a sharp note to Calhoun demanding an explanation. This was the\r\nbeginning of one of the most acrimonious controversies in American\r\npolitics.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nWith Crawford as the witness against Calhoun, it is essential to turn\r\nfor a moment to the career of this remarkable and singularly unfortunate\r\nstatesman. No student of the period, not poisoned by the prejudices and\r\njealousies of Adams, who filled the pages of his diary with grotesque\r\ncaricatures of his rivals, can escape the conclusion that William H.\r\nCrawford was one of the purest and ablest statesmen of his day. At the\r\ntime he entered the Senate, in his thirty-fifth year, he was a splendid\r\nfigure--handsome, virile, magnetic, independent in thought, and\r\naudacious in action. He was the great war leader in the Senate, as was\r\nCalhoun in the House. He had made the most profound impression on the\r\nbusiness men of the Nation of any publicist since Hamilton by his fight\r\nfor strict governmental economy, for the scrutinizing of all\r\nexpenditures, and by his championship of the National Bank in a\r\nbrilliant and exhaustive speech in reply to Clay. After two years as\r\nMinister to France, Madison called him into his Cabinet to unravel the\r\nhopeless tangle in the War Department. He served as adviser to Madison\r\nduring the remainder of his Administration, continued as the official\r\nadviser of Monroe through the eight years of his Presidency, and was\r\nurged by Adams to continue in a similar capacity under him. He was soon\r\ntransferred from the War Department to the Treasury, where he served for\r\nnine years to the complete satisfaction of the business men of the\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\nEven as early as the close of the Madison Administration, a powerful\r\nelement, opposed to the precedent which pointed to Monroe for the\r\nsuccession, centered on Crawford. Numerous newspapers strongly urged his\r\nelection, offers of support poured in upon him, and had he at that time\r\nentered actively into the plans of his friends, there is every reason to\r\nbelieve he would have been chosen. When the Congress convened, the\r\nmajority favored his candidacy. The caucus was postponed. The\r\nAdministration put forth its utmost, exertions for Monroe. Crawford\r\nremained inactive. And when he definitely put his claims aside, a number\r\nof his friends refused to participate in the caucus, in which,\r\nnotwithstanding his own lack of interest and the prestige of the\r\nAdministration, Monroe was barely nominated by a vote of 65 to 54 for\r\nCrawford.\r\n\r\nThe Cabinet of Monroe was so constituted as to make it a house divided\r\nthree ways against itself. Adams, Calhoun, and Crawford were all\r\nmembers, all were presidential candidates, and none had a clearer right\r\nto aspire to the succession than the one who had lacked only twelve\r\nvotes of the nomination in 1816. The three-cornered fight began in\r\nearnest as early as 1821. With Adams, Crawford’s relations were far from\r\nfriendly, as we may judge from the numerous vindictive comments in the\r\nformer’s diary. Between Crawford and Jackson no love was lost, and we\r\nfind the Georgian writing to a correspondent of Jackson’s “depravity and\r\nvindictiveness.”[266] But Calhoun was to prove the most unscrupulous and\r\nhostile of his foes.\r\n\r\nIt was not unknown to Crawford that Calhoun had earnestly sought the\r\nalienation of his supporters at the time of Monroe’s election. And, as\r\nthe election of 1824 approached, Calhoun’s personal organ at the capital\r\nbecame intemperate in its attacks upon him. But the climax, involving\r\nCalhoun, was reached in the spring of 1824, when the “A. B.” papers\r\nappeared in Calhoun journals, followed by a formal charge in the House\r\nof Representatives, filed by Ninian Edwards of Illinois, alleging\r\nirregularities and misconduct in office against the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury. Here we have the issue direct between Calhoun, seldom accused\r\nof being an unscrupulous intriguer, and Crawford, against whom history\r\nhas lodged the charge. The connection between Calhoun and the attack\r\nappears clear enough. Edwards was Calhoun’s friend. The paper that\r\npublished the “A. B.” papers was Calhoun’s paper and was edited by a\r\nclerk in Calhoun’s office.\r\n\r\nImmediately after making the charges, Edwards was appointed Minister to\r\nMexico--on the recommendation of Adams, Secretary of State. During the\r\ntwo weeks previous to Edwards’s departure for his post, Calhoun made\r\nalmost daily visits to his room in a lodging-house, spending from one to\r\ntwo hours with him on each occasion.[267] Nor does Adams, judger of men\r\nand motives, appear entirely free from complicity in view of his efforts\r\nto dissuade Monroe from summoning Edwards back to Washington to testify\r\nin the investigation ordered by the House on the demand of Crawford. The\r\ninvestigation disclosed that Edwards was a liar, and the committee,\r\nincluding Webster, Livingston, and Randolph, unanimously reported that\r\n“nothing has been proved to impeach the integrity of the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury or to bring into doubt the general correctness and ability\r\nof his administration of the public finances.”\r\n\r\nThere is ample justification for the conclusion that Calhoun was\r\ndirectly implicated in an unscrupulous attempt to blacken the reputation\r\nof a rival, and that Adams shared with him in the earnest desire that\r\nthe investigation should be postponed until after the presidential\r\nelection.\r\n\r\nIn the early stages of the contest everything indicated Crawford’s\r\ntriumph. Then Tragedy intervened. As a result of the administering of\r\nlobelia by an unskilled physician, Crawford suffered a stroke. For a\r\ntime he lost both sight and the power of speech. His nervous system was\r\nshattered. He lost the use of his lower limbs. But such is the pull of\r\nan overshadowing ambition that even in this plight he refused to\r\nwithdraw from the race. The Opposition press was not above exaggerating\r\nhis condition. And at such a time the caucus was held. The galleries\r\nwere packed, but the attendance on the floor was slight. Out of the 261\r\nmembers, only 68 were present, the friends of Calhoun, Adams, Clay, and\r\nJackson having reached an agreement not to enter the caucus. Thus the\r\ncontest was thrown into the House, where Clay went over to Adams and\r\nelected him.\r\n\r\nThere are few more poignant pictures associated with the failure of\r\nlofty political ambitions than that in the country home of the Georgian\r\nwhere he sat with his family about the blazing fire, awaiting the news\r\nfrom the Capitol.[268] His reputation had been dishonestly assailed, his\r\nhealth was broken, his fortune was gone, and, after having almost\r\ntouched the Presidency, he calmly awaited the final word of failure. The\r\ndaughters, who adored him, in their efforts to soften the expected blow,\r\ntold him of their joyous dreams of a return to “Woodlawn,” the Georgia\r\ncountry home, where all could be much happier. When the expected\r\nmessenger arrived and announced the election of Adams, the defeated\r\nstatesman, without a change of tone or countenance, merely remarked that\r\nhe thought it would be Jackson. The next day a letter from the new\r\nPresident urged him to continue in the Cabinet, Jackson called, “frank,\r\ncourteous, and almost cordial,” and a little later Thomas Jefferson\r\nwrote his frank regrets.[269] And thus, having declined the Adams\r\ninvitation, after a remarkable career in the service of his country,\r\nWilliam H. Crawford, poorer than the day he entered public life, and\r\nphysically a wreck, returned to “Woodlawn” in its magnificent oak\r\nforest, with its charming, winding driveways, with its peach and apple\r\nblossoms, and its gardens and its shrubbery. And here under an ancient\r\noak he was to sit for many evenings with his children and his friends.\r\nThat he sometimes thought over the lost hope, we may be sure; that he\r\noften associated it with Calhoun, there can be no doubt.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nThe first act of Jackson’s, on being told of Calhoun’s hostility in the\r\nMonroe Cabinet, was to call for a copy of Crawford’s letter to Forsyth,\r\nand to enclose it in a letter to the Vice-President, expressing his\r\nsurprise and asking for his version. The next development in the\r\ncontroversy came in the form of a long letter from Calhoun, practically\r\nadmitting the charge, and elaborately condemning and damning Crawford\r\nfor the betrayal of a Cabinet secret. This reply was delivered to\r\nJackson on a Sunday on his way to church, and he wrote a brief and\r\nsignificant answer on his return to the White House on the same day. The\r\nclosing words sealed the doom of Calhoun as far as the Presidency was\r\nconcerned. “In your and Mr. Crawford’s dispute I have no interest\r\nwhatever,” he wrote. “But it may become necessary for me hereafter, when\r\nI shall have more leisure and the documents at hand, to notice the\r\nhistorical facts and references in your communication--which will give a\r\nvery different view to the subject. Understanding you now, no further\r\ncommunication with you on this subject is necessary.”\r\n\r\nAbout this time he sent Calhoun’s letter to Van Buren, who refused to\r\nread it, explaining that he would be accused of fomenting the trouble\r\nand preferred to know nothing about it. When the messenger returned to\r\nJackson with the comment of his Secretary of State, he replied, “I\r\nreckon Van is right. I dare say they will try to throw the blame on\r\nhim.”[270] And of course Van Buren was right. After many conferences on\r\nthe subject with Calhoun, Adams recorded in his diary that “Calhoun is\r\nunder the firm persuasion that the author of this combustion is Martin\r\nVan Buren, who has used the agency of James A. Hamilton in producing it,\r\nand that Hamilton, as well as Forsyth, had been a go-between to and from\r\nNashville.”[271] The denial of Van Buren at the time was discounted by\r\nthe anxiety of Hamilton, after talking with Forsyth in Georgia, to have\r\nCrawford’s statement in writing. Nothing, however, could have been more\r\neffective in eliminating Calhoun from the presidential race.\r\n\r\nThat he appreciated his predicament and fought desperately to extricate\r\nhimself is shown in various ways. Wirt declared, at the time, that “he\r\nhas blasted his prospects of future advancement,” and Adams described\r\nhim as a “drowning man.” But the most conclusive evidence of Calhoun’s\r\ndesperate efforts is to be found in the numerous notations in Adams’s\r\njournal. The first entry is to the effect that he had “received a letter\r\nfrom John C. Calhoun ... relating to his personal controversy with\r\nPresident Jackson and William H. Crawford. He questions me concerning\r\nthe letter of Gen. Jackson to Mr. Monroe which Crawford alleges to have\r\nbeen produced at the Cabinet meetings on the Seminole War, and asks for\r\ncopies, if I think proper to give them, of Crawford’s letter to me,\r\nwhich I received last summer, and of my answer.” It is characteristic\r\nthat the only comment of Adams is an impartial damnation of the trio,\r\nJackson, Calhoun, and Crawford, and especially of the Carolinian for his\r\n“icy-hearted dereliction of all the decencies of social intercourse with\r\nme, solely from terror of Jackson.” But the day following, we find Adams\r\ndelving into his diary of 1818. “I thought it advisable,” he writes, “to\r\nhave extracts from it made of all those parts relating to the Seminole\r\nWar and the Cabinet meetings concerning it. As the copy must be made by\r\nan entirely confidential hand, my wife undertakes the task.”[272] A\r\nlittle later[273] we find a Mr. Crowninshield applying to him on behalf\r\nof Mr. Crawford for a written verification of the Cabinet incident. And\r\nfour days after that we have Calhoun writing again “requesting\r\nstatements of the conduct of Mr. Crawford in the deliberations of the\r\nCabinet upon the Seminole War.”[274] The same day Wirt[275] informs\r\nAdams that he has received a similar note from the Georgian, and asks\r\nfor a conference.\r\n\r\nThat night Adams went to Wirt’s lodgings on Capitol Hill and found him\r\nin bed and asleep. He was awakened, however, by a fellow lodger, and a\r\nfour-hour conference followed, with Adams reading the former\r\nAttorney-General the letter from Crawford and the answer sent, and also\r\nfrom the Adams diary of May to August, 1818.\r\n\r\nIt seems that Adams was not prompt in complying with Calhoun’s request,\r\nand a third letter reached him pressing him for a statement of\r\nCrawford’s conduct and opinions expressed at the Cabinet consultation on\r\nthe Seminole War, causing the former President to comment sourly in his\r\ndiary that he would give no letter until he had seen all the\r\ncorrespondence, and knew precisely the points in dispute.[276] There\r\nappears to have been little disposition on the part of Calhoun to meet\r\nthis requirement, for Adams notes that he had received from Calhoun “an\r\nextract” from Crawford’s letter to Forsyth, but not all the\r\ncorrespondence.[277] On the next day, the Carolinian, who was evidently\r\ndevoting himself feverishly and exclusively to the hopeless attempt to\r\nsave himself, sent “a further extract from the Crawford letter.”[278]\r\nThe unpleasant old Puritan, thoroughly enjoying the torture of the\r\nfighting politicians, calmly awaited all the correspondence, and thus a\r\nweek later we learn from the diary that “Mr. Martin took me aside and\r\ndelivered to me a letter from Vice-President Calhoun with a bundle of\r\npapers, being the correspondence ...,” and that the messenger “said that\r\nMr. Calhoun wished to have the papers returned to him to-morrow\r\nmorning.”[279]\r\n\r\nOn the following day Wirt, having moved to Gadsby’s, was there informed\r\nby Adams that he had received the correspondence, but “that Mr. Calhoun\r\nhad withheld two important papers; one, the letter from General Jackson\r\nto Mr. Monroe of Jan. 6, 1818, and the other, Crawford’s last letter to\r\nCalhoun, which, he sent me word, he had returned to Crawford.”[280] A\r\nfew days later a Dr. Hunt called upon Adams, “more full of politics and\r\npersonalities than of physic,” with the announcement that “Mr. Calhoun’s\r\npamphlet is to be published to-morrow morning.”[281]\r\n\r\nTo Adams the issue was clear--a battle between Calhoun and Van Buren for\r\nthe Presidency. The next day this pamphlet, bearing the elaborate title,\r\n“Correspondence between General Andrew Jackson and John C. Calhoun,\r\nPresident and Vice-President of the United States, on the Subject of the\r\nCourse of the latter in the deliberations of the Cabinet of Mr. Monroe\r\non the Occurrences in the Seminole War,” was published at midnight by\r\nDuff Green in the “National Telegraph.” “In my walk about the Capitol\r\nSquare,” writes Adams, “I met E. Everett, R. G. Amory, E. Wyer, and\r\nMatthew L. Davis, all of whom, with the exception of Wyer, spoke of the\r\npamphlet. I received a copy of it under cover from Mr. Calhoun\r\nhimself.”[282]\r\n\r\nThen the war opened in earnest. The “Telegraph” favorably commented upon\r\nthe pamphlet, and the “Globe” unfavorably. Adams found that “the effect\r\nof Mr. Calhoun’s pamphlet is yet scarcely perceptible in Congress, still\r\nless upon public opinion,” and that, while the Administration was at war\r\nwith itself, “the stream of popularity runs almost as strongly in its\r\nfavor as ever.”[283] Not content with the pamphlet alone, the “National\r\nTelegraph” followed it with Crawford’s letter to Calhoun, and another of\r\nForsyth’s, and Adams observed with interest that “in all this\r\ncorrespondence Van Buren is not seen; but James A. Hamilton, intimately\r\nconnected with him, is a busy intermeddler throughout.”[284] This\r\nnotation was in line with the gossip of the capital at the time of the\r\ncontroversy.\r\n\r\nA little more than a week after the appearance of the pamphlet, Calhoun\r\npublished his correspondence with Hamilton in the “Telegraph,” and Duff\r\nGreen, in the same issue, editorially charged Van Buren with\r\nresponsibility for the rumpus. And this was met on the following day by\r\nthe latter in a letter to the paper positively denying any interest in\r\nthe controversy, or any knowledge of Hamilton’s correspondence with\r\nForsyth or Calhoun. Green responded by writing Van Buren down as a\r\nliar.[285] Thus the controversy raged, drawing politicians, one after\r\nanother, into the fight. But in this fearsome medley of charges and\r\ncounter-charges one fact stood out--that Calhoun had misrepresented his\r\nconduct in the Monroe Cabinet to Jackson, and, on being betrayed by\r\nCrawford, had incurred the deadly enmity of the President. As far as\r\nJackson was concerned in the public controversy, the matter rested with\r\nCalhoun’s initial letter of admission that he had opposed Jackson’s\r\ncourse in the war. He prepared an elaborate statement of the facts for\r\nthe purposes of history, turned it over to the editor of the “Globe,”\r\nwho became his literary executor, and he, in turn, permitted Kendall to\r\nstudy it when he was planning a biography of the President.[286] But of\r\nall this the public knew nothing.\r\n\r\nThe inevitable storm had broken. Van Buren, suavely in the background,\r\nwas clearly the beneficiary, Calhoun just as clearly the victim. After\r\nthis the great Carolinian lost interest in the Presidency, all concern\r\nwith party, and henceforth, with occasional attacks on Jackson,\r\nconcentrated on sectionalism and slavery. His disaffection was to carry\r\nwith it that of his more ardent supporters, and thus in scarcely more\r\nthan a year Calhoun, Tyler, Tazewell, and the men who looked to them for\r\nguidance, passed from the Administration camp to join the Opposition.\r\nAnd the incident had one immediate effect--inseparable from it--the\r\ndisruption of the Cabinet with the eradication of the last vestige of\r\nCalhoun influence from all the executive branches of the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nMRS. EATON DEMOLISHES THE CABINET\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nAt the time the politicians were discussing the open rupture with\r\nCalhoun, two horsemen might have been seen riding slowly through\r\nGeorgetown, and out on the Tenallytown road, engaged in earnest\r\nconversation. It was not a novelty, however, to the people of the\r\nancient river town, for this had long been a favorite route of Jackson\r\nand Van Buren on their daily rides. On this occasion Jackson had been\r\ndiscussing the painful lack of harmony in his Cabinet and had expressed\r\nthe hope that his troubles were about over.\r\n\r\n“No, General,” said Van Buren, a little nervously, “there is but one\r\nthing that will give you peace.”\r\n\r\n“What is that, sir?” snapped the grim one.\r\n\r\n“My resignation.”\r\n\r\n“Never, sir; even you know little of Andrew Jackson if you suppose him\r\ncapable of consenting to such a humiliation of his friends by his\r\nenemies.”\r\n\r\nTo understand the conditions leading to such a suggestion from Van\r\nBuren, it is necessary to refer to the serious petticoat entanglement in\r\nwhich Jackson found himself within a few weeks after his inauguration,\r\nbecause of the presence of Senator Eaton in his Cabinet. It is an\r\namusing fact that the first real democratic administration in American\r\nhistory should have been all but wrecked on a social issue. Aside from\r\nthe agreeable work of “turning the rascals out,” little had occurred to\r\ndisturb the serenity of the new Administration between the inauguration\r\nand the meeting of the Congress in the following December but this\r\nsocial war. The call to battle had been sounded even before Jackson had\r\ntaken the oath of office; the battle raged with unprecedented fury for\r\nmany months, finally wrecking the Cabinet and advancing Van Buren to\r\nwithin sight of the White House. It has not been uncommon for women to\r\nchange the course of political and dynastic history in other countries,\r\nbut to this day the case of the captivating Margaret O’Neal is unique in\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nThe pretty daughter of a popular tavern-keeper, whose old-fashioned\r\nhouse was a favorite with statesmen and their wives, she had developed\r\ninto womanhood under the eyes of men famous in the State. Here Jackson\r\nlived during his senatorial service, and grew fond of the vivacious\r\nchild he often held on his knee. With the education a doting father\r\nlavished upon her, and with her intimate contact with men of ability and\r\nwomen of refinement, she found herself, on the threshold of life, the\r\nintellectual peer of the best of her sex. It is not unnatural that this\r\nclever and beautiful girl should have incurred the jealous displeasure\r\nof the less attractive spouses of the elder statesmen. Her rare beauty\r\nalone would have done that had she been as virtuous as Cæsar’s wife\r\nshould have been. Perley Poore[287] describes her as of medium height,\r\nstraight and delicate and of perfect proportions; with a skin of\r\ndelicate white, tinged with red, and with an abundance of dark hair\r\nclustered above her broad, expressive forehead; with a nose of perfect\r\nGreek proportions, a finely curved mouth, a firm, round chin--the\r\nAspasia of Washington. When, in addition to her physical and\r\nintellectual charms, it must be recorded that she occasionally played\r\nthe rôle of barmaid, permitting such liberties as men in the early\r\nstages of their cups would take, it is easy to understand why the more\r\nsedate matrons of the little capital were prone to look upon her as\r\nbeyond the pale. She had married a purser in the navy, and even her\r\nenemies at the time conceded that the match was a _mésalliance_ because\r\nof her intellectual superiority. In time the husband sailed across the\r\nsea, leaving his comely young wife in the rather free-and-easy\r\natmosphere of her father’s tavern. The moral conditions of the capital\r\nwere not such as to spare the most virtuous, thus situated, from the\r\ntongue of gossip. A contemporary has said that the Washington of those\r\ndays “resembled in recklessness and extravagance the spirit of the\r\nEngland of the Seventeenth Century, so graphically portrayed in\r\nThackeray’s Humorists.’ ... Laxity of morals and the coolest disregard\r\npossible, characterized that period of our existence.”[288]\r\n\r\nLiving at the O’Neal tavern at the time was the wealthy Senator Eaton,\r\nwho had manifested more than a passing interest in “Peggy,” as she was\r\ncalled, before her marriage. Gossip had it that he became more than ever\r\nattentive when the sailor went to sea. When, after a drunken debauch,\r\nwhich the gossips, without the slightest justification, ascribed to the\r\nworthless seaman’s knowledge of his wife’s friendship for the Senator,\r\nthe husband shot himself, and Eaton was found in her company with\r\nincreasing frequency, the case was complete as far as the drawing-rooms\r\nwere concerned. All that evidence could not furnish, the imagination\r\ndid, and pretty Peggy stood pilloried in the community.\r\n\r\nIt was at this juncture that Eaton asked the advice of Jackson as to a\r\nmarriage. With characteristic impulsiveness the old warrior replied that\r\nif he loved her he should marry her and save her good name by the act.\r\nThus, on January 1, 1829, the future Secretary of War was married to the\r\ntavern-keeper’s daughter, and instantly the drawing-rooms began to buzz.\r\nOne of the patrician ladies of the time of the wedding poured forth the\r\nchatter of the social set. Here we find that Mrs. Eaton “had never been\r\nadmitted into good society”; that while “very handsome” she was “not of\r\nan inspiring character” and had a “violent temper”; that notwithstanding\r\nthis she was “irresistible” and “carries\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Margaret Patton_]\r\n\r\nwhatever point she sets her mind on.” The enemies of Jackson were\r\nlaughing in the drawing-rooms and diverting themselves “with the idea of\r\nwhat a suitable lady in waiting Mrs. Eaton will make for Mrs. Jackson,”\r\nand were repeating “the old adage, ‘Birds of a feather flock\r\ntogether.’”[289] In arriving at an understanding of Jackson’s vigorous\r\ndefense of the lady of his Cabinet, it is well to bear in mind that the\r\nsame scandal-mongers were rolling the name of Mrs. Jackson on their\r\ntongues. The same letter relates how one of Mrs. Smith’s gentlemen\r\ncallers “laughed and joked about Mrs. Jackson and her pipe.”\r\n\r\nThe marriage might have remained merely one of the innumerable morsels\r\nwith which ladies sometimes regale the drawing-rooms but for the\r\nannouncement that Eaton had been invited into the Cabinet--and that\r\nspread the controversy to the politicians. Among these Senator John\r\nBranch had the courage or the insolence personally to press the point\r\nupon Jackson that, because of social complications, the appointment of\r\nEaton would be “unpopular and unfortunate.”[290] Jackson heard his\r\nfuture Secretary of the Navy in stern silence, and appointed Eaton\r\nSecretary of War. The inauguration was scarcely over when the petticoat\r\nbattle began. The most fashionable minister at the capital at the time,\r\nat whose church Mrs. Smith, the Branches, the Berriens, and the Inghams\r\nworshiped,[291] importuned, no doubt, by the society women of the city,\r\nand quite probably encouraged by the Cabinet ladies of his congregation,\r\npersuaded a Philadelphia minister to write the President of the alleged\r\nirregularities of Mrs. Eaton. Some of these ministerial charges are\r\nunfit for print. Jackson sent a stinging reply, and at the same time\r\nemployed detectives to investigate the charges. The search of the\r\nsleuths was unavailing, and the situation became so embarrassing to the\r\nPhiladelphia clergyman that he demanded that the Washington minister\r\nshould reveal himself.\r\n\r\nThus, on the evening of September 1, 1829, a unique conference was held\r\nat the White House, when Jackson confronted the two clergymen, in the\r\npresence of witnesses, and forced them to admit that they had no\r\nevidence. One of the worst charges had been that a certain physician,\r\nconveniently dead, had said that Mrs. Eaton had undergone a premature\r\n_accouchement_ when her husband had been more than a year at sea--the\r\ndate fixed as 1821. When confronted by the fact that the first husband\r\nhad not gone to sea until 1824, the clergyman lightly changed the date\r\nto conform. This disgusted and enraged Jackson. Because he\r\ncross-examined the gentlemen of the cloth regarding a matter affecting\r\nthe reputation of a woman, some historians have been resentful of his\r\nseverity.[292] The purpose was to convince the members of the Cabinet,\r\nwho were present, that their ladies were working a grave injustice upon\r\nthe wife of a colleague in refusing her social intercourse. But far from\r\nsatisfying the women, the discomfiture of the minister and the utter\r\ncollapse of the case only embittered them the more against her. The\r\nminister was placed in a painful position, dubbed by the irrepressible\r\n“Ike” Hill as “the chaplain of the conspiracy,” and described by Mrs.\r\nSmith[293] as having been “rendered incapable of attending to his\r\nministerial duties to such a degree as to produce great dissatisfaction\r\nin his congregation.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile months had gone by and Mrs. Eaton was still snubbed. Mrs.\r\nCalhoun, a thorough aristocrat, had positively refused to call. Mrs.\r\nIngham, whose own reputation was not unquestioned, took her cue from\r\nMrs. Calhoun. Branch tells us that when, in May, his wife and daughters\r\njoined him in Washington, they found Mrs. Eaton “excluded from society,”\r\nand that he “did not deem it their duty to endeavor to control or\r\ncounteract the decision of the ladies of Washington.”[294] Miss Berrien\r\nhad accepted the verdict of the women, and her father was openly\r\nexpressing his admiration for “the heroic virtues of John Branch for\r\nhazarding his place rather than permit his wife and daughters to\r\nassociate with the wife of John H. Eaton.”[295] Parties were given and\r\nMrs. Eaton was not invited; at public receptions she was snubbed.\r\n\r\nThis was all meat and drink to Adams, who recorded in his diary, after\r\nsome scandal gossip with Mrs. Rush: “I told Mrs. Rush that this struggle\r\nwas likely to terminate in a party division of Caps and Hats.” It is\r\nthis suggestion as to party divisions which imposes upon the historian\r\nthe necessity of dwelling upon this strange petticoat squabble. It is\r\nscarcely an exaggeration to say that, when Martin Van Buren appeared at\r\nsocial functions with the pretty Peggy on his arm, he made himself\r\nPresident of the United States.\r\n\r\nWhen the Red Fox arrived in Washington and noted the passionate\r\ndetermination of the iron man at the White House to force a social\r\nrecognition of Mrs. Eaton, he could not have been unmindful of his\r\nadvantage. He was a widower. No wife or daughters were with him to be\r\ncompromised. His biographer[296] makes the point that he called upon the\r\naccused woman in response to common instincts of decency, and that his\r\nfailure to have done so would have amounted to a striking public\r\ncondemnation. But he did something more than merely call upon her--he\r\nbecame an active and aggressive partisan of her cause, and by so doing\r\nendeared himself to Jackson. Common decency did not demand that he\r\nfeature her at his dinners and receptions, or enter into an agreement\r\nwith two unmarried members of the diplomatic corps to do likewise.[297]\r\nIt is impossible to account for this extraordinary partisanship on any\r\nother grounds than his desire to curry special favor with the\r\nPresident. His conduct and activities became the subject of jests and\r\nquips. “It is asserted that if Mr. Van Buren persists in visiting her\r\n[Mrs. Eaton], our ladies will not go to his house,” wrote one of the\r\nstubborn dames.[298] With the ladies of the Cabinet giving large\r\nparties, the wife of Eaton was omitted from the invitation lists, and\r\nVan Buren countered with dinners and dances at the British and Russian\r\nLegations at which Mrs. Eaton was treated with marked distinction. But\r\neven here “cotillion after cotillion dissolved into its original\r\nelements when she was placed at its head.”[299] At the Russian Legation,\r\nMadame Huygens, wife of the Dutch Minister, on finding that her seat was\r\nbeside Mrs. Eaton at the table, haughtily took her husband’s arm and\r\nstalked impressively from the room. Because of this affront, Jackson was\r\nprone to make it an international incident by demanding the recall of\r\nthe Minister, but Van Buren’s sense of humor intervened. In sheer\r\ndelight Adams wrote: “Mr. Vaughan ... gave a ball last night which was\r\nopened by Mr. Bankhead, the Secretary of the British Legation, and Mrs.\r\nEaton; and Mr. Van Buren has issued cards also for a ball which is to be\r\ngiven in honor of the same lady. I confine myself to the Russian and\r\nTurkish war.”[300] In the late summer of 1829 the effect of the struggle\r\nupon both Jackson and Van Buren was apparent. The President, disgusted,\r\nworn, and sick at heart, was confiding to his correspondents his\r\npartiality for the calm of the Hermitage. And Adams, riding about the\r\nenvirons, and encountering Van Buren, similarly taking the air,\r\nspitefully wrote: “His pale and haggard looks show it is already a\r\nreward of mortification. If it should prove, as there is every\r\nprobability that it will, a reward of treachery, it will be but his\r\ndesert.”[301]\r\n\r\nWhen the winter came and the social season opened, the contest naturally\r\nintensified. Ingham, Branch, and Berrien gave large parties from which\r\nMrs. Eaton was excluded, while “on the other hand the President made her\r\ndoubly conspicuous by an over display of notice.”[302] At one of the\r\nPresident’s drawing-rooms she was surrounded by a crowd eager to please\r\nthe host, but Mrs. Donelson, mistress of the White House, held aloof.\r\nThis rebellion under his own roof caused the aged President the deepest\r\npain. Adams records a melodramatic appeal by Van Buren to Mrs. Donelson,\r\nwhich was highly colored by the ardent Pepys, but such an appeal was\r\nmade.[303] The effect of the fight was disastrous to the Administration.\r\nThe members of the Cabinet were speedily involved by their wives, and\r\nfor a time Eaton and Branch did not speak. It was at this juncture that\r\nJackson determined to intervene, and “to bring them to speaking\r\nterms.”[304] His intermediary for the purpose, Colonel Richard M.\r\nJohnson,[305] was not a Talleyrand, and his lack of tact in his talks\r\nwith Branch, Berrien, and Ingham made matters all the worse. When the\r\nrelations of the Cabinet members became threatening, Jackson demanded\r\nthat they meet and reach a basis for official intercourse at least. The\r\nmeeting was held at the home of Berrien, attended by Branch, Eaton, and\r\nBarry. The negotiations were conducted with dignity and decorum, Branch\r\nsatisfactorily explained invitations to the ministers who had accused\r\nEaton’s wife, and the two shook hands as a token of reconciliation.[306]\r\nMeanwhile Congress was in session. All attempts to hold Cabinet meetings\r\nhad long been abandoned. The lines were drawn tightly. The slights and\r\nindignities to Mrs. Eaton had become all but intolerable. And much was\r\nbeing heard of the alleged frailty and indiscretions of Mrs.\r\nIngham--stories that seem to have been well known at the time, but to\r\nhave been given renewed currency by Eaton.[307]\r\n\r\nIt was at this juncture that Van Buren, riding with Jackson, proposed\r\nthe acceptance of his resignation. Meditating the step for some time he\r\nhad been unable to muster the courage to broach the subject. For four\r\ndays the President and his Secretary of State rode the Tenallytown road\r\nearnestly debating the propriety of the plan, and on the fourth day,\r\njust as they reached their turning-point at the Tenallytown Gate,\r\nJackson gave a reluctant consent and suggested the British Mission. But\r\nthe grim old warrior was loath to part with his one strong friend in the\r\nCabinet, and early the next morning he summoned Van Buren to the White\r\nHouse, and in great agitation, and with significance, explained anew\r\nthat it was his custom to release from association with him any man who\r\nfelt that he ought to go. Thoroughly alarmed, Van Buren, with emotion,\r\nwithdrew all he had said, and announced a willingness to retain his post\r\nuntil dismissed. Deeply touched, Jackson proposed another discussion on\r\ntheir afternoon ride. It was that afternoon that it was agreed to call\r\nothers into the conference; and the next night Van Buren had as dinner\r\nguests Jackson, Barry, Eaton, and Major Lewis. Finally Eaton agreed to\r\nfollow with his resignation. Would Peggy consent, asked the tactful Fox.\r\nHer husband thought she would. The next night the five met at dinner\r\nagain, with Eaton reporting his wife’s acquiescence in the plans. But\r\nwhen, a few days later, Jackson and Van Buren, out for a stroll, stopped\r\nat the Eaton house, their reception from the mistress was so cold and\r\nformal that the Secretary commented upon it, and Jackson shrugged his\r\nshoulders in silence. But the die was cast. The plan was made. Van Buren\r\nand Eaton would resign, thus paving the way for the resignation of the\r\nCalhoun followers, and a reorganization of the Cabinet--with the\r\nCalhoun influence entirely eliminated.[308]\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHE decision made, the old President must have felt a sense of ineffable\r\nrelief. His Cabinet had been a failure and he realized it. His\r\ndissatisfaction with a majority of its members was not due entirely to\r\ntheir hostility to Mrs. Eaton. The fight against the National Bank was\r\nin its incipiency and he looked upon Ingham as a tool of the Bank; the\r\nNullification doctrine was being promulgated and he considered Berrien a\r\nNullifier--and in both surmises he was right. He thought Branch pompous,\r\nincompetent, and subservient to petticoat rule. And we may be sure that\r\nwhether or not the Cabinet was to be reorganized in the interest of Van\r\nBuren, the relations of all three toward the Carolinian entered into his\r\ndecision to rid himself of them. There is evidence that he quite early\r\ndetermined to displace Berrien, but nothing of record to indicate the\r\ncause. In the man selected for his place, however, we have ample\r\njustification for the suspicion that the Red Fox had poisoned his mind\r\nagainst his Attorney-General. It was on the suggestion of Van Buren,\r\nvery soon after the formation of the Cabinet in 1829, that the\r\nAttorney-Generalship was offered to Louis McLane, who, in disgust, had\r\nretired to Wilmington for the practice of his profession, with the\r\ninducement that he would later be transferred to the Supreme Bench on\r\nthe death of the rapidly failing Justice Duval. Before breakfast one\r\nmorning, after a hard ride over the wretched mud roads, Hamilton, the\r\nlieutenant of Van Buren, arrived at the McLane home with the proposal,\r\nwhich was accepted. Nothing, however, was done--another mystery that\r\ndied with Jackson and his Secretary of State.[309]\r\n\r\nBut the coast was now clear. A strong workable Cabinet after Jackson’s\r\nown heart could be created. The manner in which he went about ridding\r\nhimself of the undesirable members of the old Cabinet is graphically\r\nillustrated in the account left by Branch.[310] It is easy to visualize\r\nthe scene in the President’s room, whither he has summoned Branch to\r\ninform him of the resignations of Van Buren and Eaton. There is a\r\n“solemn pause.” The Secretary, sensing the intent, smiles, and suggests\r\nthat the grim one is not “acting in a character nature intended him\r\nfor”; that he is not a diplomatist, and should speak frankly. Whereupon\r\nJackson, “with great apparent kindness,” explains his purpose, points to\r\na commission as Governor of Florida upon the table, and announces that\r\nit will be a pleasure to fill in the name of the visitor. Branch\r\nhaughtily declares that he had “not supported him for the sake of\r\noffice,” and soon retires. Returning to his office, Branch prepares and\r\nsends in his resignation courteously, but not omitting to mention that\r\nthe action was taken in response to the President’s wish. Whereupon\r\nJackson, splitting hairs, writes a protest against the statement that\r\nhis correspondent’s resignation had been asked. “I did not,” he writes,\r\n“as to yourself, express a wish that you would retire.” But since the\r\nCabinet had come in “harmoniously and as a unit,” and two were\r\nvoluntarily retiring, it had become “indispensable” to reorganize\r\ncompletely the official household “to guard against misrepresentation.”\r\nMore correspondence follows, ending with a gracious acceptance of the\r\nresignation, coupled with an expression of appreciation of the\r\n“integrity and zeal” with which the Secretary of the Navy had discharged\r\nhis duties.[311]\r\n\r\nIngham made the President’s task easy with a brief note of resignation,\r\nand passed permanently from public life.[312] But Berrien was loath to\r\ngo. In discussing the situation with friends, he made no secret of his\r\ndesire to retain his post, but on learning that Jackson had no such\r\nnotion, he withdrew in a friendly and dignified letter.[313]\r\n\r\nThe period between the announcement of Van Buren’s resignation and the\r\nappointment of the new Cabinet was rich in food for the gossips. What\r\nwould become of the Red Fox? Would Mrs. Eaton have her triumph in the\r\nelevation of her husband to some other post of distinction? And what\r\nwould be the factional complexion of the new Cabinet? John Tyler,\r\nsending his budget of gossip home, rather questioned the rumor that Van\r\nBuren would be groomed for Vice-President and thought he would prefer to\r\ngo abroad. It had also reached Tyler that Hugh L. White might become\r\nSecretary of War, and that “Livingston is to rule the roost,” and he\r\nlamented that in the latter event “the Constitution may be construed to\r\nmean anything and everything.” He had likewise heard that McLane would\r\nbe Secretary of the Treasury, “but how,” he asked, “can he ever be\r\nacceptable to the South with his notions on the tariff and internal\r\nimprovement?”[314] Meanwhile there appears to have been a rather\r\ndefinite plan on the part of Jackson and Van Buren for the building of\r\nthe new Cabinet.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nEither the President or Van Buren could very plausibly have been\r\nresponsible for the decision as to Livingston and the State portfolio,\r\nbut the fact remains that the proffer of the post was made through the\r\nlatter. The Louisiana statesman was spending his summer vacation at his\r\ncountry place on the Hudson when a mysterious letter reached him from\r\nthe New York politician, summoning him instantly to Washington, and\r\nwarning him, on leaving, to conceal his destination. Observing both the\r\nsummons and the injunction, he proceeded at once to the capital, and\r\nwith some misgivings accepted the post of Secretary of State.[315] That\r\nthis was Van Buren’s appointment seems more than probable.\r\n\r\nFor the Treasury, Louis McLane, Minister to England, a subordinate, as\r\nsuch, to Van Buren, with whom he had worked in perfect accord\r\npolitically, and whose wife was ambitious for Cabinet honors,[316] was\r\nsummoned home from London. As Van Buren had, at this time, selected the\r\nLondon post for himself, this appointment was unquestionably his own.\r\n\r\nThe one embarrassing hitch came in the selection of a Secretary of War.\r\nIt was the plan to have Senator Hugh L. White of Tennessee relinquish\r\nhis seat for the War Office, thus opening the way for the election of\r\nEaton to his old position in the Senate. But White was cold to the\r\nproposition. The mutual friends of the President and the Tennessee\r\nSenator importuned him to no effect. James K. Polk strongly urged him.\r\nFelix Grundy added his appeal. Another wrote him: “The old man says that\r\nall his plans will be defeated unless you agree to come.”[317] Jackson\r\nhimself did not hesitate to go with White’s brother-in-law to Virginia\r\nto request Senator Tazewell, an intimate of White’s, to exert his\r\ninfluence--but to no avail. The reason for this refusal, furnished by a\r\nkinswoman, throws light on the general understanding as to the purpose\r\nof the Cabinet reorganization--he did not intend to “thereby aid in the\r\nelevation of Mr. Van Buren to the Presidency.”[318] Thus did Jackson’s\r\nearnest wish to serve his friends, the Eatons, fail at a critical\r\njuncture. After the place was also refused by Representative Drayton of\r\nSouth Carolina, an enemy of Nullification, Jackson turned to his old\r\nco-worker in the War of 1812, and Lewis Cass, then Governor of Michigan,\r\nentered the new Cabinet. This was probably Jackson’s personal\r\nappointment, albeit years before, while acting as judge advocate in the\r\ncourt-martial of General Hull, Van Buren had learned to his discomfiture\r\nthat Cass was no ordinary man.[319] More successful in caring for his\r\nfriend Isaac Hill than for the Eatons, a proffer of the Navy portfolio\r\nto Senator Levi Woodbury of New Hampshire created a senatorial vacancy\r\nthat fell to the fighting journalist. Incidentally the relations between\r\nVan Buren and Woodbury were close.\r\n\r\nIn finding a successor for Berrien the President was handicapped by the\r\ngeneral opinion of his friends, including Van Buren, that his retention\r\nwould serve a good purpose. During the period of uncertainty numerous\r\nnames were canvassed, the favorite of the politicians being James\r\nBuchanan.[320] The first suggestion of Roger Taney was made to Jackson\r\nby a Washington physician who had ventured to say that he knew “a man\r\nwho will suit for Attorney-General.” The disinterestedness and high\r\ncharacter of this truly great and much-maligned man shines forth in his\r\nconduct during this period of negotiations. He not only did not press\r\nhis claims, but urged the retention of Berrien, and, under his\r\ninstructions, his brother-in-law (Key) did likewise. Thus we find Key\r\ncalling upon Livingston, Barry, and Woodbury, urging the keeping of\r\nBerrien on the ground that “it would have a good effect upon the affairs\r\nof the party, both as to its bearing on the Indian and the Eaton\r\nquestions.”[321] All three agreed, but confessed a delicacy about\r\nbroaching the subject unless consulted. In the midst of these\r\nnegotiations, Key was summoned to the White House and informed of the\r\nintention to invite Taney into the Cabinet. Again Key urged the wisdom\r\nof retaining Berrien; the President firmly rejected the idea, and thus,\r\non his personal judgment, Jackson secured the services of one of the\r\nstrongest figures to be associated with him in his most bitter battle.\r\n\r\nLivingston, McLane, Cass, Woodbury, and Taney--this at any rate was not\r\nthe “millennial of the minnows.” But the new Cabinet was not to be\r\nreceived with universal acclaim. The Calhoun followers grumbled that it\r\nwas a Van Buren Cabinet; and Tyler, thinking in terms of State Rights,\r\ncomplained bitterly that State-Rights men had been left “entirely out in\r\nthe cold.”[322]\r\n\r\nNor did the Eaton trouble dissipate instantly on the passing of the\r\nfirst Cabinet. The retired members stoutly insisted on every occasion\r\nthat they had been forced out because of their refusal to coerce their\r\nwives to associate with naughty Peggy. After his return to his North\r\nCarolina home, Branch, in a voluminous letter, charged all the\r\nresponsibility for the disruption of the Cabinet to the social issue.\r\nBerrien, albeit not only willing but anxious to remain, on his return to\r\nGeorgia eulogized Jackson at a complimentary dinner in his honor, but\r\nadded that when he attempted to prescribe rules for the association of\r\nthe families of his Ministers he scorned the dictation.[323] And Duff\r\nGreen was so active and persistent in ascribing the upheaval to the\r\nEaton affair that Key was convinced “that that matter had not occasioned\r\nthe change in the Cabinet.”[324] The gossips of the drawing-rooms,\r\ndistressed at being deprived of a choice morsel, set their teeth into it\r\nwith a grim determination to hold on. Mrs. Bayard Smith, as though\r\npersonally affronted, wrote to a friend: “The papers do not exaggerate,\r\nnay do not retail one half his [Jackson’s] imbecilities. He is\r\ncompletely under the domination of Mrs. Eaton, one of the most\r\nambitious, violent, malignant, yet silly women you ever heard of.” And a\r\nfew days later she returns to the attack: “Mrs. Eaton cannot be forced\r\nor persuaded to leave Washington.... She ... believes that next winter\r\nthe present Cabinet Ministers will open their doors to her. Mrs. McLane\r\nhas already committed herself on that point. Previous to her going to\r\nEngland, while on a visit here, in direct violation of her most violent\r\nasseverations previously made, she visited this lady, and instantly\r\nbecame a great favorite with the President.”[325]\r\n\r\nHowever, if Mrs. Eaton lingered, others departed with undignified\r\ncelerity. As soon as the robes of office fell from his shoulders, Eaton\r\nbegan a search for Ingham to administer a personal chastisement. The\r\nlatter, who had been peculiarly offensive, and whose own wife was a\r\nvictim of the gossips, would not fight a duel. He did not care to fight\r\nat all. Thus began an amusing chase. Eaton lay in wait for him in the\r\nstreets, while the dignified ex-Minister of Finance carefully picked his\r\nway home through the muddy alleys and back yards into the back door of\r\nhis house. At length the chase became uncomfortable. A stage-coach was\r\nchartered. The Inghams’ baggage was packed. Two hours before daybreak,\r\nthe coach driver might have been seen lashing his horses through the mud\r\nand water of the capital, bearing on their way to Philadelphia the\r\nerstwhile Cabinet Minister and his family.\r\n\r\nThe first Cabinet, which almost immediately put on a drawing-room\r\ncomedy, went out with a rip-roaring farce, with seconds bearing ominous\r\nmessages, and with Cabinet officers lying in wait in the shadows,\r\ncreeping through alleys, brandishing pistols, and in the darkest hours\r\nbefore the dawn lumbering in stage-coaches out of the capital city to\r\nescape a shot.\r\n\r\nThe thoroughly frightened Ingham openly charged that Eaton intended to\r\nmurder him, and the letters of the former secretaries concerning the\r\n“murder conspiracy” added mightily to the amusement of the enemies of\r\nthe Administration and to the chagrin and disgust of its friends.\r\n“Before you receive this,” wrote a Washingtonian to Senator John\r\nForsyth, “you will have seen the disgraceful publications of Eaton and\r\nIngham, which, of course, are the sole topics of conversation here. The\r\nrumor was that the President was engaged the day before yesterday in\r\ninvestigating the matter, and I know that he had a magistrate with him\r\ntaking depositions.”[326] The hilarity of Jackson’s enemies was vividly\r\nexpressed in a cartoon, entitled “The Rats Leaving a Falling House,”\r\npublished in Philadelphia, and, with childish delight, Adams records in\r\nhis diary that “two thousand copies of this print have been sold in\r\nPhiladelphia this day,” and that the ten thousand copies struck of “will\r\nbe disposed of within a fortnight.”[327]\r\n\r\nVan Buren was sent to the English Court. Eaton was made Governor of\r\nFlorida and later Minister to Spain, where Mrs. Eaton, in the most\r\ndignified Court in Europe, became a brilliant success. Ingham passed\r\nfrom public life. Branch affiliated with the Whigs in 1832 and in 1836,\r\nand was made Governor of Florida by Tyler. Berrien became one of the\r\norators and leaders of the Whigs, and one of the founders of the\r\nKnow-Nothing Party. Thus, after two years of disorganization and\r\ndomestic turmoil, the Jackson Administration, with a powerful Cabinet,\r\nand, for the first time, a definite policy, began to strike its stride.\r\nAt least two of the new Ministers were to play leading and spectacular\r\nparts in the great party battles that were to follow.\r\n\r\nIt must have been with a sense of ineffable relief that Jackson, seated\r\nat the head of the Cabinet table, surveyed the new men with whom he had\r\nsurrounded himself--a feeling in which the public shared. But as his\r\nglance moved about the table it no doubt lingered with greatest\r\nconfidence and satisfaction upon the three whose very appearance bespoke\r\ncharacter, intellectuality, and power. At his right hand the tall\r\nfigure, with the student’s stoop, the meditative manner, the benevolent\r\nexpression, which had stood beside him in the stirring days of New\r\nOrleans--the scholarly Livingston. Nearby he recognized in the imposing\r\nfigure with the robust, well-knit frame, the huge head, the bushy brows,\r\nthe penetrating, fighting blue eyes of Cass, a man of the solidity and\r\nstrength that he admired and trusted. The one strange figure about the\r\ntable, destined to prove more nearly a man after his own heart than any\r\nother who was to serve him in the Cabinet, was Taney--thin and delicate\r\nlike Jackson himself, with the student’s stoop of Livingston, but\r\nwithout his calm. Between these three and the others, there was a\r\ndecided descent, although they were men of ability and reputation.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nEdward Livingston was one of the strongest characters of his time, a\r\nNationalist as intense as Webster, who was to pen a document as virile\r\nand militant as Webster’s speech for the Union--one of the most\r\nbrilliant, talented, and polished publicists the Republic has known.\r\nThis premier of the greatest of democrats, was a thorough aristocrat,\r\ntracing his lineage back to the English peerage. Compared with him, the\r\nOpposition leaders and even their ladies of the drawing-rooms lamenting\r\nthe social crudities of the Jacksonians were of mongrel breed. And yet\r\nthis highest type of aristocrat was, by preference, one of the most\r\nardent of democrats. When, in his thirtieth year, he entered the\r\nNational House of Representatives from his native city of New York, he\r\nhad behind him every advantage and before him every opportunity.\r\nDistinguishing himself by brilliancy in debate, vigor in attack, when he\r\nleft Congress his militant leadership of the Jeffersonian party had\r\nconvinced Hamilton that he had to be destroyed.[328] Jefferson made him\r\ndistrict attorney; the people elected him to the mayoralty of New York,\r\nand the attempt to serve in both capacities wrought his financial ruin.\r\nWhile personally directing the fight against the yellow fever plague, he\r\nwas himself stricken, and he recovered only to find that his assistant\r\nin the district attorney’s office had squandered $100,000 of the public\r\nmoney on wine and women. Without a moment’s hesitation he conveyed all\r\nhis property to a trustee for sale, beggared himself completely, and\r\nresigned both his offices. The public protested against his abandonment\r\nof the mayoralty, and for two months the Governor refused to accept his\r\nresignation, but he knew that the path of duty led to the replenishment\r\nof his purse. Thus, at thirty-nine, leaving behind him the prestige of\r\nhis family connections and his own career, he turned toward Louisiana,\r\nthen the Promised Land, and set forth for New Orleans. There he\r\nimmediately took high rank in his profession, established a lucrative\r\npractice, and soon acquired valuable real estate abutting the river\r\nwhich promised a fortune. The story of how he was deprived of this\r\nthrough the incomprehensible spite of President Jefferson constitutes\r\none of the most fascinating chapters in the history of American\r\nlitigation.[329] But Livingston was sustained by infinite patience, a\r\nhappy philosophy, and natural buoyancy of temperament, and he soon found\r\nother matters to enlist his interest. When Jackson reached New Orleans\r\nto defend the town, it was Livingston who aroused the militant spirit of\r\nthe people with his martial eloquence, and served as the soldier’s aid,\r\ntranslator, and adviser. It was in these days amidst the barking of the\r\nEnglish guns that Jackson discovered\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Edw Livingston_]\r\n\r\nin Livingston the man he could trust as a patriot and fighter in two of\r\nthe bitterest battles of his Presidency.[330] It was soon after this\r\nthat Livingston began the greatest undertaking of his life--one so\r\nfar-reaching in its effect on humanity as to carry his name to the\r\nthinkers, philosophers, and philanthropists of every land. The\r\n“Livingston Code” alone entitles him to a place high on the scroll of\r\nhumanitarians who have served mankind. Victor Hugo declared that he\r\nwould be “numbered among the men of this age who have deserved most and\r\nbest of mankind.” Jeremy Bentham was tremendously impressed. Dr. H. S.\r\nMaine, author of the “Ancient Laws,” pronounced him “the first legal\r\ngenius of modern times.” Villemain, of the Paris Sorbonne, described his\r\nwork as “a work without example from the hand of any one man.” From the\r\nEmperor of Russia and the King of Sweden came autograph letters, from\r\nthe King of the Netherlands a gold medal and a eulogy, and statesmen and\r\nphilosophers of Europe vied with kings and emperors in paying homage.\r\nThe Government of Guatemala, not content with translating his “Code on\r\nReform and Prison Discipline,” and adopting it without the change of a\r\nword, bestowed upon a new city and district the name of Livingston.\r\nJefferson wrote: “It will certainly array your name with the sages of\r\nantiquity”; Kent and Story, Madison and Marshall joined in the common\r\npraise, and he was elected a member of the Institute of France. Such was\r\nthe prestige he took to Washington, when, in his fifty-ninth year, he\r\nagain entered the House as a Representative from New Orleans.\r\n\r\nHe was now an old man, but of unusual vigor, and able to wear out\r\nyounger men with his long pedestrian jaunts. He loved society and\r\nmingled with it freely, unable to escape it if he would because of the\r\nsocial and intellectual brilliance of his wife and the charm and beauty\r\nof his daughter. His fame was seemingly secure. His reputation was\r\nworld-wide. His conversational gifts were of an uncommon order. His\r\nfriends and social intimates were confined to no party, and embraced the\r\nbest of both. After a brief period in the House he had entered the\r\nSenate where he stood among the foremost. Such was the man Jackson\r\ncalled to the head of his Cabinet--one whose character and career suffer\r\nnothing by comparison with those of his most distinguished predecessors,\r\nJefferson, John Quincy Adams, and Henry Clay.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nWe are not concerned with the Roger B. Taney who wrote the Dred Scott\r\ndecision, but with that portion of his career, little known and\r\nappreciated, which convinced Jackson that he was worthy of wearing the\r\nmantle of John Marshall. And that is by far the most dramatic phase of\r\nhis life--his battling years. Born and reared on a Maryland plantation,\r\namong horses and slaves, he grew up to be an independent, self-reliant\r\nyouth. At Dickinson College he refused to take down a portion of a\r\nlecture which assailed our republican governmental system. As\r\nvaledictorian of his class he suffered torments from a morbid fear of\r\npublic speaking. Thus even as a student he was independent in thought,\r\ncourageously devoted to his convictions, brave in battle, but miserably\r\nself-conscious on parade.\r\n\r\nOn graduating, he returned to the woods and fields of the plantation,\r\nabandoned his books, and gave himself up to the joys of fox-hunting,\r\nleading the life of the old-fashioned English country gentleman. When he\r\ntook up the study of law in Annapolis, however, he abandoned this\r\noutdoor life in turn, and, declining all social invitations, devoted\r\nhimself to his studies, and to fighting his native timidity, in a\r\ndebating society. Here also he studied the methods of two of the\r\nNation’s greatest advocates, Luther Martin and William Pinkney.\r\n\r\nAnd, strangely enough, this great lawyer in the making, began the\r\npractice of the law as a side issue to politics. In the quiet rural\r\ncommunity of his nativity, where there was little litigation and no\r\nopportunity for professional distinction, he settled, for the sole\r\npurpose of entering the House of Delegates. This, however, in compliance\r\nwith the wishes of his aggressively Federalistic father. Thus, at the\r\nage of twenty-two, we find young Taney responding to the roll-call as a\r\npronounced Federalist of the school of Hamilton. It is noteworthy that\r\nhe was defeated in the next election because of the Jeffersonian\r\nrevolution of 1800.\r\n\r\nThis setback changed the course of his career. An uncompromising\r\nFederalist with Federalism apparently dead, politics no longer promised\r\na future, and he turned now to the serious consideration of the law, and\r\nlocated at Frederick where the Democrats were overwhelmingly\r\npredominant. In this community, rich, intellectual, cultured, and\r\nhospitable, he instantly took his place among the leaders of the bar and\r\nentered upon a lucrative practice. A Federalist from principle, he did\r\nnot hesitate, when called to lead the forlorn hope. As a Federalist, he\r\nopposed the War of 1812. Up to this point his political career was\r\nsimilar to that of Webster.\r\n\r\nAnd it is in the divergence of the two careers at this point that the\r\nfuture of Taney turned. He fought the war until the die was cast, and\r\nthen threw himself with intense fervor into the support of his country\r\nagainst the foreign foe. Contemptuous of the disloyalists of his\r\npolitical family, he summoned the Federalists to the unqualified support\r\nof the American arms, and such was his prestige that a large portion of\r\nthe party in Maryland followed his lead.[331] By subordinating party to\r\ncountry, he all but obliterated party lines, and when he was nominated\r\nfor Congress as a war Federalist he all but wiped out the normal\r\nDemocratic majority. Had he gone to Washington at that time as a lone\r\nFederalist supporting the war, to face Webster, fighting the\r\norganization of the army and the appropriations, his national reputation\r\nwould have come eighteen years before it did. For his was no\r\nhalf-hearted hate of the disloyalty of his party co-workers. This is the\r\nfirst decisive action upon which an interpretation of his political\r\ncharacter may be predicated.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, restricting himself more and more to his profession,\r\nfrequently associated with Luther Martin in the most important\r\nlitigation, his reputation spread throughout the State, and the\r\npolitician was merged with the lawyer. It was in connection with one of\r\nhis most sensational cases that he took a position on slavery and the\r\nright of abolitionists to be heard that throws a high light on his\r\ncharacter and courage.\r\n\r\nAn abolitionist minister from Pennsylvania had gone to Maryland and made\r\na ferocious attack on slavery in a public meeting attended by some\r\nslaves. The excitement and feeling against him were intense. To the\r\nsensitive slave-owners the speech seemed a deliberate incitation of the\r\nslaves to insurrection. The minister’s life was in danger. It required\r\nsupreme courage for a Maryland lawyer in that slave-holding community to\r\nstand between the abolitionist and the popular clamor against him, and\r\nTaney stepped from the professional ranks to plead his cause, not\r\nperfunctorily, but with a passionate defiance worthy of the highest\r\ntraditions of his profession. He made his defense on no less grounds\r\nthan “the rights of conscience and the freedom of speech.” And he spoke\r\non slavery even as Garrison or Lincoln might have spoken. In a courtroom\r\ncrowded with slave-owners who were his neighbors, he touched boldly on\r\nthe pathos and the tragedy of the institution. After this daring defense\r\nbefore a slave-holding jury, the hated abolitionist was acquitted--and\r\nthe records of the American courts record no nobler triumph.\r\n\r\nThe death of Pinkney and the disqualification of Martin soon advanced\r\nTaney to the head of the Maryland bar. It was one year after he had\r\nestablished himself in Baltimore that he first allied himself with the\r\nsupporters of Andrew Jackson. During the campaign of 1824 was published\r\na letter written by Jackson to Madison seven years before, urging the\r\nrecognition of those Federalists who had broken with their party to\r\nsupport the War of 1812, and suggesting the name of Colonel Drayton of\r\nSouth Carolina.[332] Discriminating between the anti-war Federalists and\r\nthe pro-war Federalists, Jackson here declared that had he been\r\ncommander of the military department in which the Hartford Convention\r\nwas held, he would have court-martialed the three leaders of the\r\nConvention. This announcement of his views had attracted to his standard\r\nmany pro-war Federalists of Maryland, and the most notable acquisition\r\nwas Roger B. Taney. He was impelled to his course with no thought of\r\npolitical reward. His whole mind and heart were in his profession.\r\nJackson knew nothing of Taney’s partiality at the time, and only learned\r\nof it about the time he was seeking a successor for Berrien. At no time\r\nin his life had the Maryland lawyer been so thoroughly satisfied with\r\nhis lot. He had been made Attorney-General of the State on the unanimous\r\nrecommendation of the bar, and this was the only office to which he ever\r\naspired. It was in line with his work and left him at home with his\r\nfamily and his books. Such was his situation, when, through a\r\nnon-political suggestion, he was offered the position in the Cabinet of\r\nJackson.\r\n\r\nAt this time he was in his fifty-fourth year, with no taste for the\r\ntrickery and intrigues of politics, and he asked nothing better for his\r\nleisure hours than meditative tramps through the woods, a canter on his\r\nhorse, a volume of poetry or history, or the delights of his home,\r\npresided over by the sister of the author of “The Star-Spangled Banner.”\r\nAn ardent Catholic, he was strict in the observance of his religious\r\nduties. Always vehement in his views, and uncompromising in his\r\nconvictions, he was almost unpleasantly decisive in the expression of\r\nhis political opinions. Such was his lofty conception of official\r\npropriety that while in office he was to refuse to accept the slightest\r\ntoken of appreciation from people with whom he had official\r\nrelations.[333] He had all the courtesy and courtliness of his culture,\r\nall the caution of the painstaking lawyer, and all the circumspection of\r\nthe man jealous of his honor. He was to become the most virile assistant\r\nof Jackson in the bitterest fight of his Presidency, the most trusted of\r\nhis Cabinet, because the most like Jackson in the vigor of his blows.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nTo describe Lewis Cass as an American politician would be damning with\r\nfaint praise, for he was something infinitely more and greater--he was\r\nan empire-builder of the company of Clive and Rhodes, one of the most\r\nrobust figures in American history. His first remembered view of the\r\nworld was that of being held in his mother’s arms, and looking out the\r\nwindows of his New Hampshire home upon the bonfires blazing in\r\ncelebration of the ratification of the Constitution. Crossing the\r\nAlleghanies on foot, with a knap-sack on his back, sleeping beneath the\r\nstars, his Americanism had expanded in the contemplation of the\r\nmagnitude of the Republic. Riding the circuit, as Western lawyers did in\r\nthose days, he was a witness of the stubborn battles against the\r\nwilderness, and he had enough imagination to see, in the rough men\r\nwielding axes, Homeric figures. And it was while pursuing his lonely way\r\nthrough the virgin forests of Ohio that he found time for the\r\nassimilation of his reading and learned to be the independent and\r\ncourageous thinker he became.\r\n\r\nHe had established a sound reputation at the bar, when the War of 1812\r\nadded that of a gallant and brilliant soldier. To him especially are we\r\nindebted for the shameful story of Hull’s cowardly surrender of\r\nDetroit--an act so maddening that Cass broke his sword in protest. But\r\nhis reputation as lawyer and soldier pales by comparison with the\r\nreputation he was to make as an empire-builder.\r\n\r\nNever was a ruler confronted by more disheartening difficulties than\r\nCass, when, in 1813, he became the civil Governor of Michigan. For two\r\nyears he was forced to battle against anarchy and famine. Organized\r\nsociety was demoralized. The country was disorganized. The savages had\r\ndriven away the cattle of the settlers, and the French especially were\r\nin desperate straits. The war-whoops of the red men had so terrorized\r\nthe people that they were afraid to settle down to the cultivation of\r\nthe land. The morale of the Territory was pathetically low. And Cass,\r\nwith the empire-builder’s decision and genius, instantly formed his plan\r\nto combat the threatened disintegration. The people had to be fed--he\r\nfed them from the public stores, drew upon the Government for further\r\nassistance, personally directed the battle against famine--and won. The\r\nconfidence of the people had to be restored as a preliminary to\r\nprogress--he determined to restore it by demonstrating his mastery of\r\nthe savages. Organizing the young men, he personally led them against\r\nthe Indians in a bloody skirmish--and won. He repeated it--and won.\r\nAgain--and won. And thus the terror of the people passed, and they\r\nreturned to their homes.\r\n\r\nHe then turned to the organization of civil government. Courts were\r\ncreated, civil officers selected, territorial divisions established, new\r\ncounties were carved, and he began an elaborate policy of road-building\r\nand internal improvements. One of his first acts was to establish a\r\nschool system, and to encourage the building of churches with the\r\nassurance of religious liberty.\r\n\r\nThis accomplished, he turned with his usual zeal to the Americanizing of\r\nthe people, many of whom were French, and to encouraging the migration\r\nof colonists. Knowing the industry and energy of his native New England,\r\nhe planned to draw immigrants from that section hoping that the French\r\nwould learn by their success to emulate their example. But here he had\r\nanother battle to overcome the general notion of the Eastern States that\r\nthe land of Michigan was valueless. In time he succeeded.\r\n\r\nAnd then he found time to challenge the right of the British across the\r\nborder to interfere in the affairs of the Territory. In those days\r\nMichigan was only a Territory on the outskirts, and it was easier for\r\nthe National Government to ignore insults than to challenge a mighty\r\nempire by protesting against them. As late as 1816 vessels were stopped\r\non their way to Detroit and searched by British agents. Cass, with\r\nlawyer-like care, collected his evidence, transmitted it to Washington,\r\nvigorously protested to the British authorities--and won.[334]\r\n\r\nNowhere, perhaps, does his vision as an empire-builder, shine more\r\nluminously than in his letter to Calhoun, Secretary of War, proposing a\r\nscientific expedition in 1819, under the sanction and with the\r\ncoöperation of the Federal Government.[335] This was the programme of a\r\nstatesman. And he asked for experts for the expedition--engineers,\r\nzoölogists, botanists, mineralogists. Determining to accompany the\r\nexpedition, it is interesting to note the sagacity of the reason he\r\nassigns: “I think it very important to carry the flag of the United\r\nStates into those remote sections where it has never been borne by any\r\none in public station.” This was the most important expedition ever\r\nundertaken by the American Government up to that time, and was so\r\nregarded by the press of the period.\r\n\r\nIf we add to this, his successful negotiations of treaties with the\r\nIndians under dramatic circumstances, we have the work and record of\r\n“The Father of the West”--empire-builder from 1813 until he entered the\r\nCabinet of Jackson in 1831.\r\n\r\nAnd this man of action, fighting life-and-death battles on the fringe of\r\ncivilization, found time for the gratification of literary tastes. Here\r\nhe suggests the Roosevelt of a much later day. When starting forth on an\r\nexpedition into the wilderness, it was his custom to supply himself with\r\na small library for his entertainment while floating in canoes on the\r\nrivers or the lakes. His articles in later years disclose the\r\nscholar.[336] Just before entering the Cabinet he had delivered a\r\nscholarly address at Hamilton College which has been preserved in a\r\nnumber of the popular collections of orations.[337]\r\n\r\nLivingston the Nationalist.\r\n\r\nCass, the Empire-Builder.\r\n\r\nTaney, the Crusader.\r\n\r\nOut of the career of any one of these might be woven a romance. All were\r\nof heroic mould, veritable Plutarchian figures. And we shall see that\r\nthe time had arrived when Jackson would need the wisest and most\r\ncourageous of counselors--for Henry Clay was returning in shining armor\r\nto lead the bitterest of partisan battles against the Administration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nKITCHEN CABINET PORTRAITS\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning the virile, militant, driving factors behind\r\nJackson’s policies were found outside his official family. The “Kitchen\r\nCabinet,” so called in derision, was more influential in the moulding of\r\nevents than the old-fashioned, conventional statesmen who advised their\r\nchief in the seclusion of the Cabinet room. Had Jackson depended wholly\r\non his Cabinet for the support of his policies, he would have been\r\nconstantly confused by divided counsels. On scarcely any of the vital\r\nissues of his Presidency did he have the hearty coöperation of his\r\nconstitutional advisers. But never before, nor since, has any President\r\nbeen served by such tireless organizers of the people, such masters of\r\nmass psychology, such geniuses in the art of publicity and propaganda.\r\nThese men, the small but loyal and sleepless group of the Kitchen\r\nCabinet, were the first of America’s great practical politicians.\r\n\r\nOf this group the master mind was Amos Kendall, born in a New England\r\nfarmhouse in the latter days of the eighteenth century. In youth, he\r\npreferred study to play, and because of a premature solemnity he was\r\nfamiliarly known as “The Deacon.” His timidity was as painful as that\r\nwhich tortured Charlotte Brontë. The stupid act of a teacher in\r\nridiculing his reading of an oration came near putting a period to his\r\neducation, and at Dartmouth he was almost moved to tears by professorial\r\npraise of one of his essays. His college days were so serious and\r\nlaborious that his health suffered, and his constitution was impaired.\r\nHe played no pranks and had no dissipations. Taking his politics\r\nseriously, the overwhelming preponderance of Federalists did not\r\nrestrain him from\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AMOS KENDALL\r\n\r\nFrom an engraving in the _Democratic Review_, March, 1838, after a\r\ndrawing by Charles Fenderick]\r\n\r\nbelligerently espousing the cause of the minority. It is significant of\r\nhis instinctive bent that when he turned to politics he shed his\r\ntimidity and stood forth a passionate militant. Graduating from the\r\ncollege that Webster loved, he declined his diploma, partly because of\r\nindifference, but largely because of his personal dislike of the\r\npresident. Thus early he entertained no illusions, and had the courage\r\nof both his convictions and his prejudices.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the second war with England was on, and he was beginning to\r\ndetest the New England Federalists for their disloyalty and\r\nilliberality. The pulpits rang with bitter denunciations of Madison, and\r\nministers proclaimed from the pulpits that Democrats were “irreligious\r\nprofligates.”[338] In Boston, Kendall heard the eloquent Harrison Gray\r\nOtis ferociously denounce the war, and he hastened home to enlist, to be\r\nrejected for physical disabilities.\r\n\r\nIn his twenty-fifth year he set forth from his bleak New Hampshire home\r\nto seek his fortune, and we are able to sense the spirit and temper of\r\nthe youth from the jottings of his journal. At Boston he heard Edward\r\nEverett whom he thought a “youth of great promise.” At Washington he\r\nattended a White House levee, finding Dolly Madison “a noble and\r\ndignified person,” the President’s “personal appearance very inferior,”\r\nand meeting Felix Grundy and Lewis Cass. Thence he passed down the Ohio,\r\na guest of Major Barry, and became a citizen of Kentucky.\r\n\r\nAt Lexington he entered the home of Henry Clay, engaged by Mrs. Clay as\r\na tutor for the children. In later years, when he was the mysterious\r\npower in the Jackson Administration, and Clay the leader of the\r\nOpposition, the drawing-rooms of Washington buzzed with a fantastic\r\ntale, intended to prove his depravity and ingratitude. Harriet\r\nMartineau,[339] while in the capital, heard it and incorporated it in\r\nher book. According to this story “tidings reached Mr. and Mrs. Clay\r\none evening that a young man, solitary and poor, lay ill of a fever in a\r\nnoisy hotel in the town. Mrs. Clay went down in the carriage without\r\ndelay, and brought the sufferer home to her house, where she nursed him\r\nwith her own hands till he recovered. Mr. Clay was struck with the\r\ntalents of the young man and retained him as a tutor of his sons,\r\nheaping benefits upon him with characteristic bounty.” Unhappily for the\r\ntale, Kendall was not ill, Mr. Clay was at Geneva at the time of his\r\nemployment and during the entire period of his stay in Ashland, and the\r\n“benefits heaped upon him” consisted of $300 a year with board and\r\nlodging, and the privilege of using Mr. Clay’s library. Soon after\r\nleaving the service of the Clays, we find him recording in his diary:\r\n“Rode to Lexington and visited H. Clay. I found him a very agreeable\r\nman, and was familiarly acquainted with him in half an hour.”\r\n\r\nHowever, his sojourn at Ashland was pleasurable and profitable. Mrs.\r\nClay, deeply interested in him, chaffed him on his timidity, criticized\r\nthe stiffness of his bows, and drove him to his room to practice before\r\nthe mirror, admitted him to her social gatherings, called upon him to\r\nread his poetry to her friends, and rallied him about his love affairs.\r\nThus the “mediocre” and vulgar “writer for pay” of the Jackson régime\r\nwas once considered fit for the social circle in the home of Henry Clay.\r\n\r\nScarcely had he been admitted to the bar when he was enticed by Colonel\r\nRichard M. Johnson into the editorship of the “Georgetown Patriot”; and\r\nit is illuminative of his character to find him, when the slayer of\r\nTecumseh, a little later, upbraided him for refusing personally to abuse\r\nthe Opposition, writing in his diary: “I shall give Richard my vote, but\r\nI shall not be his tool.”[340] His editorials constructive, his\r\nspecialty banking and currency, he soon found himself in the editorial\r\nchair of the “Frankfort Argus,” where he was instantly engaged in\r\nbitter political controversies. Whether in argument, where he excelled,\r\nin invective, or in wit, he invariably scored heavily on the Opposition.\r\nFor his generation and community, his editorial code was lofty. He\r\npromised himself never knowingly to misrepresent; if, through mistake,\r\nhe did, to rectify the mistake without being asked; never to retract a\r\nstatement he thought true; to resent an insult in kind; to defend\r\nhimself, if assaulted, by any means necessary, even to killing, and\r\nnever to run. So great was his professional self-respect that on one\r\noccasion, when vulgarly assailed in an Opposition paper, he had his\r\nanswer printed in bill form and circulated by hand, rather than befoul\r\nhis own journal with a suitable reply.\r\n\r\nIn seeming contradiction, however, we have his merciless bombardment of\r\nthe unfortunate Shadrach Penn, editor of a Louisville paper, who had a\r\ngenius for attracting the ridicule of his intellectual superiors; for\r\nwhile Kendall was peppering him from Frankfort, George D. Prentice was\r\nbombarding him from Louisville, and between the two, he was driven\r\nwhimpering from the State.[341]\r\n\r\nThe physical courage of Kendall may be read in his encounters with irate\r\nvictims. In one controversy he was spared the necessity of killing an\r\nassailant with a dirk by the timely interference of friends. In another\r\nhe put an opponent to flight by cracking a whip and displaying the\r\nsparkling silver handle in the sun. He never ran.\r\n\r\nUnder his editorship the “Argus” became a powerful political factor in\r\nKentucky. He inaugurated the plan of printing legislative speeches,\r\nspecialized on political news, intelligently discussed international\r\naffairs, launched a campaign in favor of public schools, reviewed\r\ncontemporary books, dipped into religious subjects with his “Sunday\r\nReflections,” and significantly began a fight against the National Bank\r\nin a series of articles combating the Supreme Court decision as to its\r\nconstitutionality. If, thirteen years later, he was not to flinch under\r\nthe lashings of the Bank press, it may have been because he had become\r\nseasoned to the punishment more than a decade before when he was\r\ndescribed as a “political incendiary.”\r\n\r\nHis friendly relations with Clay were maintained at least until the\r\nautumn of 1827, when, on a trip to New Hampshire, he wrote his wife of\r\ndining with the orator in Washington. But the campaign of 1828 found\r\nKendall and the “Argus” valiant in the cause of Jackson, with Clay and\r\nhis friends “casting aspersions upon his motives and character.”[342] In\r\nrevenge for these attacks he sought the privilege of taking the\r\nelectoral vote of Kentucky to Washington. Meanwhile, after the election,\r\nand before his departure, he had been informed by an emissary from the\r\nHermitage that Jackson intended to offer him an appointment.\r\n\r\nThe Kendall lingering at the capital awaiting an appointment presents an\r\ninteresting study. It is disappointing to note a certain humility and\r\nmanner usually associated with the lower order of place-hunters. He was\r\nevidently ardent in his pursuit of a position. His inexperience is\r\ndisclosed in his disgust on finding so many obscure politicians\r\npretending to the distinction of having elected Jackson. And yet, so\r\nanxious was he for place, that he was willing to accept one paying an\r\ninadequate salary, and he wrote his wife that in that event he might\r\npersuade Duff Green to pay him $1000 a year for writing for the\r\n“Telegraph.”[343] During the weeks of waiting before the inauguration,\r\nhe was not a little embarrassed for funds, and yet, under these drab\r\nconditions, he did not lack for invitations of a social nature. Meeting\r\nGeneral Macomb and finding him “a Jackson man,” he expressed the hope\r\nthat he might “find him a valuable acquaintance.”[344] Meanwhile he was\r\ninvestigating houses and rents, and concluded to economize by taking a\r\nhouse in Georgetown. “The house I contemplate taking,” he wrote, “is in\r\na charming neighborhood on First Street, near Cox’s Row.”\r\n\r\nReceiving his appointment as Fourth Auditor, he dropped from public\r\nview. Dinners and parties saw him no more. He immediately assumed the\r\nrôle of a recluse. Taking his duties seriously, he uncovered the crimes\r\nof his predecessor and sent him to jail. His rules for the conduct of\r\nsubordinates were such as to merit the approval of business men--rules\r\nthat the office-holder of those days scarcely understood. After a week\r\nin office he wrote his wife: “The labor is very light, and when I am\r\nmaster of the laws under which I act, will consist of little more than\r\nlooking at accounts and signing my name.” Thus we find him systematizing\r\nhis work to dedicate the greater portion of his time to the political\r\nwork of the Administration. “Hamilton,” said Martin Van Buren, a month\r\nlater, “Kendall is to be an influential man. I wish the President would\r\ninvite him to dinner, and if you have no objection, as you are so\r\nintimate with the General, I wish you would propose to him to invite\r\nKendall to meet us at dinner to-morrow.”[345] The invitation was\r\nextended and accepted, and the Red Fox, who had a genius for picking\r\nmen, was notably attentive to the timid subordinate.\r\n\r\nDuring the five years he held his inferior post, Kendall became more\r\npowerful than any Cabinet Minister in the determination of Jacksonian\r\npolicies. A little later, a contemporary observer of men at the capital\r\ndescribed him as “secretive, yet audacious in his political methods, a\r\npowerful and ready writer, and the author of many of Jackson’s ablest\r\nState papers.”[346] There in his office we may picture him, alone, with\r\npad and pencil, preparing elaborate political war maps, and literature\r\nfor propaganda, or in earnest conversation with Lewis and other members\r\nof the Kitchen Cabinet, forging thunderbolts with which to smite the\r\nfoe. And it was very soon after he had left this subordinate post that\r\nHarriet Martineau was impressed with the uncanny mystery of the\r\n“invincible Amos Kendall.”\r\n\r\n“I was fortunate enough,” she wrote, “to catch a glimpse of the\r\ninvincible Amos Kendall, one of the most remarkable men in America. He\r\nis supposed to be the moving spring of the Administration; the thinker,\r\nthe planner, the doer; but it is all in the dark. Documents are issued,\r\nthe excellence of which prevents them from being attributed to the\r\npersons that take the responsibility for them; a correspondence is kept\r\nup all over the country, for which no one seems answerable; work is done\r\nof goblin extent and with goblin speed, which makes men look about them\r\nwith superstitious wonder; and the invincible Amos Kendall has the\r\ncredit for it all. President Jackson’s letters to his Cabinet are said\r\nto be Kendall’s; the report on Sunday mails is attributed to Kendall;\r\nthe letters sent from Washington to remote country newspapers, whence\r\nthey are collected and published in the ‘Globe’ as demonstrations of\r\npublic opinion, are pronounced to be written by Kendall; and it is some\r\nrelief that he now, having the office of Postmaster-General, affords\r\nopportunity for open attack upon this twilight personage. He is\r\nundoubtedly a great genius. He unites with all his ‘great talents for\r\nsilence’ a splendid audacity.\r\n\r\n“It is clear he could not do the work he does if he went into society\r\nlike other men. He did, however, one evening.... The moment I went in,\r\nintimations reached me from all quarters, amid nods and winks, ‘Kendall\r\nis here,’ ‘There he is.’ I saw at once that his plea for seclusion (bad\r\nhealth) is no false one. The extreme sallowness of his complexion, the\r\nhair of such perfect whiteness as is rarely seen in a man of middle age,\r\ntestified to his disease.[347] His countenance does not help the\r\nsuperstitious to throw off their dread of him. He probably does not\r\ndesire this superstition to melt away, for there is no calculating how\r\nmuch influence is given the Jackson Administration by the universal\r\nbelief that there is a concealed eye and hand behind the machinery of\r\nGovernment, by which everything could be foreseen, and the hardest deeds\r\ndone. A member of Congress told me this night that he had watched\r\nthrough five sessions for a sight of Kendall, and had never obtained one\r\nuntil now. Kendall was leaning on a chair, his head bent down, and eyes\r\nglancing up at a member of Congress with whom he was in earnest\r\nconversation, and in a moment he was gone.”[348]\r\n\r\nSuch was the cleverest, most audacious, and powerful member of the\r\nKitchen Cabinet--a man who made history that historians have written and\r\nascribed to others who merely uttered the words or registered the will\r\nof this indomitable journalist and politician.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nWhen Jackson left the Hermitage, he was accompanied by Major William B.\r\nLewis, who had been intimately identified with his campaign for the\r\nPresidency. This unobtrusive man found lodgment with his chief at\r\nGadsby’s, where he interested himself in analyzing the characters of\r\noffice-seekers for the guidance of his friend. After walking with\r\nJackson from the hotel to the Capitol, and seeing him inducted into\r\noffice, he announced his plan to return to the quiet life of Tennessee.\r\n\r\n“Why, Major,” exclaimed the astonished Jackson, “you are not going to\r\nleave me here alone, after doing more than any other man to bring me\r\nhere!”\r\n\r\nMoved by the sincerity of the appeal, Lewis remained on in Washington\r\nthrough the eight years of the reign, living at the White House, and\r\nenjoying a greater personal intimacy with the President than any other\r\npolitician of the time. Accepting an insignificant auditorship at the\r\nTreasury as an excuse for staying on, he interpreted his real function\r\nas that of a political bodyguard. He came and went in the President’s\r\nprivate apartments at will. No formalities were interposed between these\r\ntwo strangely different men. No secrets formed a veil. In the midst of\r\nthe bitter fights against his idol, Lewis moved quietly and uncannily\r\nabout, gauging sentiment, determining the drift, analyzing men and\r\nmotives, guarding Jackson against the surprise attack. When the\r\nferocious onslaughts were at their worst in the Senate, Lewis could be\r\nfound somewhere in the shadows of the chamber watching every movement of\r\nthe enemy, and critically, if not always wisely, passing judgment upon\r\nthe strategy of the Administration forces; and when the fight was over,\r\nhe hastened to the White House, sure to find Jackson sitting up in his\r\nroom with the picture of Rachel and her Bible on the table before him,\r\nawaiting the report.\r\n\r\nThere was this difference between Lewis and the other members of the\r\nKitchen Cabinet--they all loved Jackson; but where the others thought of\r\nhim as the personification of a party, Lewis could only think of him as\r\nthe friend of the Hermitage. He had fought and wrought for his election,\r\nnot to score a party victory, but to vindicate the man. Of Jackson’s\r\ncomfort, happiness, and prestige he was supremely jealous, but there\r\nwere times when he rebelled against the audacious proposals of others,\r\nmore given to thinking of party, to stake the General’s reputation and\r\nsuccess upon a party issue.\r\n\r\nHe has been called the “great father of wire-pullers,”[349] a closet\r\nman’s definition of a great manipulator of men. At the time the public\r\nbegan to speculate on the presidential possibilities of Jackson, the\r\nMajor was his neighbor. He was not a penniless adventurer or soldier of\r\nfortune. There was nothing in politics for himself for which he cared a\r\nbauble. He was living comfortably on his large productive plantation,\r\nwith slaves in the fields, and books in the library. Jackson had learned\r\nto love and trust him years before when he was chief quartermaster on\r\nthe General’s staff in the campaign of 1812-15, and in the final\r\nsettlement the Government was found to be indebted to him to the amount\r\nof three cents--which was never paid. When the Jackson movement became\r\nserious, the Major, knowing the General’s strength and weaknesses, took\r\ncharge of all confidential matters. To just what extent he contributed\r\nto Jackson’s election no one ever knew--but all knew that he had played\r\nan important part. He conducted all the correspondence, and carefully\r\nscrutinized, and often revised, the General’s letters; and another of\r\nhis functions was to serve as a sort of valet for all State occasions\r\nwhen Jackson should be carefully groomed.\r\n\r\nHe possessed the qualities that Jackson lacked. Where Jackson was\r\nimpulsive, he was deliberative; where Jackson was prejudiced, he was\r\ntolerant; where Jackson was rash, he was prudent, if not timid; where\r\nJackson was a man of action, he was a man of thought; and while Jackson\r\nhad ideas, he furnished the vehicle to bear them in parade. During the\r\nmany months preceding the election of 1828, this practical, polished\r\npolitician was studying the political war map, and quietly planning\r\nsuccessful battles in this State and that. He knew the politics of each\r\nState, the personalities and prejudices entering in, the dominating\r\nmotives of all politicians, even to those never known outside their own\r\nlittle communities, and he knew how to play one force against the other\r\nwithout appearing in the game. Knowing as he did all the cross-currents\r\nof local politics, nothing ever arose that he could not deal with\r\nintelligently.\r\n\r\nDuring the eight years in the White House, Lewis was a whole regiment of\r\nSwiss guards--always on duty and alert. “Keep William B. Lewis to ferret\r\nout and make known to you all the plots and intrigues hatching against\r\nyour Administration, and you are safe,” was Jackson’s advice to Polk\r\nwhen the latter was entering the White House. We shall find him\r\nimplicated in some of the most important events of his time, making\r\nhistory, and yet escaping the historian. His great advantage was his\r\nperfect understanding of Jackson’s character. He often became a buffer,\r\nprotecting the President against unpleasant revelations. If he thought a\r\ndisclosure necessary as a protection to the grim old warrior, he told\r\nhis secret; if he thought it would merely arouse to useless wrath, he\r\nburied it; and sometimes, as in the case of the Crawford letter, he\r\nbided his time for months before revealing it. All the politicians of\r\nhis day passed in review before him, Democrats and Whigs, Nullifiers and\r\nNationalists, friends and enemies, and he silently catalogued them\r\nthrough a Bertillon system of his own. His advice to Jackson was that of\r\na friend to a friend, seated about the blazing White House hearth,\r\ndiscussing politics and men in the midst of the tobacco smoke, as they\r\nmight have done in the private life of the Hermitage.\r\n\r\nHe did not possess Kendall’s genius for programmes, nor Blair’s for\r\npropaganda, but he was invaluable in the field of personalities. He\r\nalone of the three sometimes doubted and drew back in fear. When Jackson\r\nvetoed the Maysville Bill, Van Buren found Lewis’s countenance “to the\r\nlast degree despondent.”[350] He dreaded and doubted the effect of the\r\nveto of the measure rechartering the Bank, and later, the withdrawal of\r\nthe deposits. Having been Federalistic himself, in other days, he had a\r\nfellow feeling for Louis McLane when that politician found himself in\r\ntrouble. But doubting and trembling though he sometimes was, Van Buren\r\nhas testified that “no considerations or temptations, through many of\r\nwhich he was obliged to pass, could weaken his fidelity to the General\r\nor his desire for the success of his Administration.”[351] In the early\r\nstages of the Bank controversy, he alone of the members of the Kitchen\r\nCabinet maintained friendly relations with Biddle.[352]\r\n\r\nConcerning his status among the Jacksonian leaders, biographers and\r\nhistorians have radically disagreed. Even among the later writers this\r\ndisagreement persists, and where one dismisses the theory that he was a\r\npolitician, far-sighted and astute, as without sufficient evidence,[353]\r\nanother concludes that “in a day of astute politicians, Major Lewis was\r\none of the cleverest.”[354] The truth appears to be that while he was\r\nnot a moulder of policies and creator of programmes, he was one of the\r\nmost clever manipulators of men and masters of personal intrigue who\r\never served a President. In the Kitchen Cabinet he was the personal\r\nmanager--the political secretary.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThe most militant of the Kitchen Cabinet was Isaac Hill, whose name was\r\nanathema to the Federalists of New England. A poor boy educated in a\r\nprintshop, slight and lame, hurling picturesque phrases and bitter\r\nreproaches at the powerful enemy, excoriating it with his satire and\r\nsarcasm, and slashing it with the keen blade of his wit, it is not\r\nsurprising that the impression handed down by the Intellectuals of the\r\nOpposition is unfavorable. Where they have not dismissed him with a\r\nshrug, they have damned him as a dunce--and largely because he gave\r\nvirility to a minority and made it militant, and, despite overwhelming\r\nodds, established in the hotbed of proscriptive Federalism a vigorous\r\nDemocratic paper which was quoted from New Orleans to Detroit, and from\r\nBoston to St. Louis. If he lacked the depth and the constructive faculty\r\nof Kendall, and the literary finish of Blair, he possessed a genius as a\r\nphrase-monger which spread his fame and served his party, and in the\r\nheat of a campaign, one of his stinging paragraphs was as effective as\r\none of Kendall’s leaders. There was no finesse in his fighting--he\r\nfought out in the open, in full range of his foe, and with any weapon on\r\nwhich he could lay his hands. If the intensity of his partisanship\r\namounted to unfairness, it had been made so by the intolerance and\r\nbigotry of the Opposition of his section. Since no member of the Kitchen\r\nCabinet more insistently demanded of Jackson the adoption of the spoils\r\nsystem, it is not unprofitable to inquire into the origin of his state\r\nof mind.\r\n\r\nHis life was a tragedy. Born in abject poverty, a cripple from\r\nchildhood, he had seen his father and grandfather become mental wrecks.\r\nUnder this cloud, in this state of penury, he looked out upon the world.\r\nShut off by his infirmity from physical labor, he had no money for an\r\neducation, and he lived on an unpromising New Hampshire farm, where\r\nthere were no schools, libraries, or books, and few papers. But before\r\nhe was eight he had read the Bible through. Two years before he had read\r\nthe story of the Revolution from books borrowed, and had supplemented\r\nhis reading by having a relative, who had fought with Washington,\r\ndescribe the burning of Charlestown and the Concord fight. There was\r\ninfinite pathos in his passion for the printed page. But college was out\r\nof the question, the printing-office the only possible substitute, and\r\nthus, after a long apprenticeship, he took over a wobbling paper at\r\nConcord and became an editor.\r\n\r\nThrowing discretion to the winds and with a sublime audacity, he took up\r\nthe challenge of the powerful majority; and it required courage to\r\npursue that course in the New Hampshire of 1809. To be a Democrat\r\n(Republican) there in those days was to offend God; boldly to preach\r\nhostility to Federalism was to proclaim blasphemy and invite\r\ndestruction. The Federalistic press opened their batteries of abuse upon\r\nthe obscure youth. One paper solemnly announced the discovery that he\r\nwas a direct descendant of the witches who had suffered at Salem. Hill\r\nreturned a spirited fire, and rejoiced in the combat. “I have hit them,\r\nfor they flutter,” he said.[355] In the campaign of 1810 he fairly\r\ngalvanized the prostrate friends of the National Administration into\r\nlife and incurred an unbelievable hatred of the Opposition. When this\r\ncrippled boy was brutally assaulted on the streets of Concord, the\r\nFederalist press of New Hampshire gloated over the attack. Nor was it\r\nabove sneering at his infirmity.\r\n\r\nThroughout the War of 1812 he was a pillar of strength to the Republic\r\nin New Hampshire. During the darkest days it was said that he was worth\r\na thousand soldiers in heartening the patriots.[356] With the approach\r\nof the campaign of 1828, Hill’s paper, the “Patriot,” began to bombard\r\nthe Adams Administration, and Clay, who was to shudder later at the\r\nwickedness of the spoils system, promptly deprived him of the public\r\nprinting.\r\n\r\nThus the campaign of 1828 began. The stinging paragraphs of Hill made\r\nthe rounds of the Democratic press of the country, and in his own State\r\nhe was shamelessly assailed. Not satisfied with maligning his personal\r\ncharacter, his enemies stooped to references to the insanity of his\r\nfather in disseminating the story that he was crazy.[357] In view of\r\nthis cruel personal persecution, it was but human that, on the election\r\nof Jackson, his voice should have been for war on all the Federalist\r\noffice-holders. Thus his psychology is easily understood. Because of\r\nhis political convictions, he had been proscribed. A cripple, he had\r\nbeen personally attacked in the streets. In suffering he had been\r\nridiculed. The insanity of his father had been made the subject of\r\nvulgar jests. His personal character had been assailed. And in the hour\r\nof victory, all the pent-up hatred of the years was let loose upon the\r\nvanquished foe.\r\n\r\nHill was the Marat of the Kitchen Cabinet, the fanatic, calling for\r\nheads--more heads--and unseemly in his mirth as they fell.\r\n\r\nIn appearance he was not prepossessing. Below the medium height, he was\r\nspare as well as crippled. In his high forehead and the expression of\r\nhis eyes his intellect was indicated, and he carried himself with that\r\nhaughty air of superiority which men, forced to fight for their\r\nexistence, are apt to assume. This was described by his enemies as\r\n“demoniacal.” He always dressed plainly as a workingman. Without\r\nimagination or dreams, severely practical and to the point, conscious of\r\nhis limitations, and passionately devoted to both his convictions and\r\nprejudices, there was nothing about him to appeal to the fashionable or\r\nthe intellectually elect. In no sense dazzling in his gifts, hesitating\r\ninstead of eloquent, shocking the Senate of his time by reading his\r\nspeeches, and proud of his profession, he was not pointed out to\r\ntravelers who wrote books, nor lionized in the drawing-rooms, nor\r\ndignified by the complimentary notices of the women letter-writers or\r\ndiarists of his day. He has come down largely as his enemies have\r\npainted him, and their very hate of him discloses his effectiveness as a\r\npolitician.\r\n\r\nHe was one of the Republic’s first uncompromising partisans--“My party,\r\nright or wrong.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nAn Administration and party paper had been considered important in the\r\npolitical circles of the Republic from the beginning, but it was left\r\nto the editors of the Kitchen Cabinet to develop it to the highest\r\ndegree of efficiency. The “National Journal,” Court paper of the Adams\r\nAdministration, had awakened the Opposition to an appreciation of the\r\npractical value of a powerful party paper. Duff Green and the\r\n“Telegraph,” in a sense, met the requirements, but even then there were\r\nDemocrats of influence and aspirations who found something lacking. To\r\nVan Buren, the editor, devoted to Calhoun, was unsatisfactory. It is\r\ninconceivable that he felt the need for a more aggressive pen for the\r\nOpposition. Nevertheless, in the summer of 1826, while planning a more\r\nvigorous attack on the Adams Administration, he had an “animated\r\nconversation” concerning the need of a strictly party paper with\r\nCalhoun, at the latter’s house in Georgetown. The Carolinian urged the\r\nadoption of the “Telegraph” as the party organ, with Van Buren pressing\r\nthe advantage of prevailing upon Thomas Ritchie of the “Richmond\r\nEnquirer” to accept the editorship of a new party paper at the\r\ncapital.[358] Failing to persuade Calhoun, the Red Fox cleverly\r\napproached Senator Tazewell of Virginia, an ardent friend of the\r\nCarolinian, and persuaded him to join in an invitation to the Richmond\r\njournalist.[359] Ritchie declined, however, on the ground of his\r\nattachment to Virginia and his reluctance to leave old friends and\r\nassociates.[360] Thus, at the beginning of the Administration, it seemed\r\nthat Duff Green and the “Telegraph” were destined to become the pen and\r\norgan of the Jacksonian Democracy.\r\n\r\nAt a White House levee in the winter of 1830-31, under the very nose of\r\nJackson, and under his roof, the intriguing Green drew the proprietor of\r\na Washington printing-house aside to tell him confidentially of the\r\nhastening rupture of Jackson and Calhoun, and of the plans in incubation\r\nfor the advancement of the presidential aspirations of the latter.\r\nCalhoun organs were to be acquired or established in all the strategic\r\npolitical points in the country, and when the rupture came these were to\r\nfollow the lead of the “Telegraph” in a nationwide denunciation of\r\nJackson. The printer was offered the editorship of one of these papers,\r\nand a liberal amount for his Washington plant. Thoroughly devoted to the\r\npolitical fortunes of the President, and not relishing the idea of being\r\nthe depositary of a secret which threatened the President’s position,\r\nthe printer consulted freely with his friends, and, on their advice,\r\ncarried the story to the White House.\r\n\r\nBenton tells us that the story did not surprise Jackson, who was\r\n“preparing for it.”[361] Thus we are told that in the summer of 1830 he\r\nhad been impressed with a powerful editorial attack on Nullification in\r\nthe “Frankfort Argus,” had made inquiries as to the identity of the\r\nauthor, and had authorized the extension of an invitation to assume the\r\neditorship of an Administration paper in the capital. The version of\r\nBenton differs in material points from the version of Amos Kendall,[362]\r\nwho was far more intimately identified with the launching of the new\r\npaper than either Benton or Van Buren. Here we have it that the idea was\r\nnot Jackson’s, and that when plans for a Jacksonian organ were presented\r\nto him “he entirely disapproved.” At that time Jackson was unable to\r\nbring himself to believe in the treachery of Green. When ultimately,\r\nhowever, he saw the drift, he gave his “tacit consent.”\r\n\r\nHere Kendall’s story clashes with the theory, put forth by Green, that\r\nVan Buren was the directing genius behind the whole project. When the\r\nPresident finally gave his “tacit consent,” the practical politicians of\r\nthe Kitchen Cabinet took charge. The various governmental offices were\r\nvisited for an understanding as to what portion of the Government\r\nprinting could be expected. When Van Buren, then at the head of the\r\nState Department, was approached, he announced that he would not give a\r\ndollar of the printing of his department, on the ground that “were such\r\na paper established its origin would be attributed to him, and he was\r\nresolved to be able to say that he had nothing to do with it.” This is\r\ntypical of Van Buren, and is no doubt true. But the responses from all\r\nthe other departments were satisfactory and the plans were pushed.\r\n\r\nHaving positively settled upon the paper, the next step was to find a\r\nmanagerial genius. In a conference between Kendall and Barry, the\r\nPostmaster-General, the latter suggested the availability of Frank P.\r\nBlair, then writing occasionally for the “Frankfort Argus,” though not\r\nattached to the paper in a regular capacity. The correspondence with\r\nBlair was conducted by Kendall. The Kentuckian, surprised, momentarily\r\nhesitated, and it was not until Kendall had agreed to bear an equal part\r\nof the responsibility that he consented.\r\n\r\nWhile Blair was getting his affairs in order in Kentucky, Kendall\r\nproceeded with the arrangements in Washington, and when the editor\r\nreached the capital nothing remained unsettled but the name and a motto.\r\nThe two agreed to call the paper the “Globe,” and the motto, suggested\r\nby Blair, “The World is Governed Too Much.”\r\n\r\nThus there appears no reason to doubt that Kendall’s version is the\r\ncorrect one, that Jackson was no more a leader in the movement than Van\r\nBuren, and that the idea was conceived by the little group of new and\r\npractical politicians, then coming to the fore, and who, while friends\r\nof Jackson, were interested in “measures more than men.”\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nThe arrival of Frank Blair in Washington was an historical event, not\r\nappreciated at the time, and scarcely properly appraised to this day.\r\nBut the ugly, illy dressed stranger, who presented himself at the White\r\nHouse immediately after reaching the capital, gave little promise, in\r\nhis appearance, of the power within him. Instead of a large, raw-boned,\r\nhusky Kentuckian expected, Major Lewis, who met him, was confronted by a\r\nshort, slender man, poorly garbed, and rather timid and retiring than\r\notherwise. The Major was frankly disappointed and probably disgusted.\r\nBut when the editor was presented to Jackson, that genius took note\r\nneither of his dress nor appearance. Although expecting foreign\r\ndiplomats and distinguished statesmen to dinner, he could see no reason\r\nwhy the unimposing little man, with the ill-fitting clothes and the ugly\r\nvisage, should not remain as his guest. Assuming that he would be alone,\r\nBlair accepted, and, to his horror, he found himself in the presence of\r\nministers in all the splendor of their official regalia. Unaccustomed to\r\nsuch show, and feeling the conspicuousness of his garb, he fled to a\r\ncorner, hoping to escape notice. But Jackson, who never judged men by\r\ntheir appearance, least of all by their clothes, sought him out with the\r\nkindest intentions, and placed him beside him at the table. This act of\r\ncourtesy, painful to Blair at the time, was understood and appreciated,\r\nand not only won his ardent support, but his deepest affection.\r\n\r\nAlthough unknown to Jackson, who would have been uninterested if he had\r\nknown, Frank Blair was qualified by blood to sit at the table of the\r\nfirst gentleman of the land. His grandfather had been acting president\r\nof Princeton when Witherspoon, signer of the Declaration, was summoned\r\nto New Jersey to accept the presidency. Born forty years before becoming\r\neditor of the “Globe,” he had displayed, in college, the remarkable\r\nintellectual qualities that were to make him the adviser of Presidents,\r\nand one of the most influential moulders of public opinion of his time.\r\nHe distinguished himself as the best rhetorician and linguist of his\r\nclass.[363] The\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRANCIS P. BLAIR\r\n\r\nROGER B. TANEY\r\n\r\nWILLIAM B. LEWIS]\r\n\r\nweakness of his voice discouraged his ambition for forensic distinction.\r\nIn the Governor’s Mansion at Frankfort he was married, early in life, to\r\na charming woman noted for “her extraordinary mental force and her\r\nsagacity.”[364]\r\n\r\nLike Kendall and Barry, Blair had begun his political career as an\r\nardent supporter of Clay, and like them, had broken with him on the\r\n“bargain” story. According to Blair’s contention through life, Clay had\r\nconfided to him in advance that, if such a contingency as did develop\r\nshould arise in the congressional caucus, he would throw his support to\r\nAdams, and that he had protested against the plan. Whether true or not,\r\nthat event marked the end of Blair’s interest in the political ambitions\r\nof the man from Ashland. From 1823 to 1827 he played a conspicuous part\r\nas one of the principals in the famous fight between the New and the Old\r\nCourts which all but reduced the State to a condition bordering on\r\nanarchy. This part of his career is difficult to understand. The New\r\nCourt Party, with which he was affiliated, was a revolutionary\r\norganization mustering its strength from the indebtedness and poverty of\r\nthe people. It proposed to relieve the condition of the poor through\r\nmethods frankly revolutionary and worse. During the period of the court\r\nfight, and while acting as the clerk of the revolutionary court, two\r\nevents completely changed the course of his career. He broke with Clay\r\nand allied himself with the Democratic Party; and he became a regular\r\ncontributor to the columns of the “Frankfort Argus,” and a journalist by\r\nprofession. On abandoning the court clerkship he immediately identified\r\nhimself with Kendall in the publication of the paper, and the combined\r\ngenius of these two extraordinary men converted the little Western\r\njournal into one of the most powerful and popular of the Jacksonian\r\norgans. All the credit appears to have gone to Kendall and none to his\r\nassociate, for after the election it was Kendall and not Blair who was\r\nassured of recognition from the incoming Administration. After Kendall\r\nwent to Washington, Blair, without the slightest notion of ever\r\nfollowing, remained in Frankfort, writing special articles in support of\r\nJacksonian policies for the “Argus.” Thus he plied his trenchant pen\r\nagainst the Bank, excoriated Nullification, attacked Clay, and damned\r\nCalhoun. He had suffered financial reverses, been forced to sacrifice\r\nmuch property, and was in distressed circumstances. Later, when he was\r\nassailed by Senator Poindexter as having gone to Washington as a\r\n“beggar,” he was indignantly to repel the charge. “The editor of the\r\n‘Globe’ resigned, on leaving Frankfort to take charge of the press\r\nhere,” he wrote, “the clerkship of the circuit court, the fees of which\r\nalone averaged $2000 annually, and the presidency of the Bank of the\r\nCommonwealth, and other employments which made his annual income upward\r\nof $3000--a sum twice as great as the salaries of the judges of the\r\nSupreme Court, and a third greater than that of the Governor of the\r\nState.”[365] Nevertheless, it was the state of his finances which had\r\nnecessitated the temporary suppression of the fact that he had accepted\r\nthe editorship of the “Globe.”\r\n\r\nOnce in the editorial chair, he assumed a militant attitude, and frankly\r\nannounced that the paper would be devoted “to the discussion and\r\nmaintenance of the principles which brought General Jackson into\r\noffice”; and as early as April, 1831, four months after the first\r\nappearance of the paper, he began vigorously to advocate the reëlection\r\nof his idol in the White House.\r\n\r\nThe first issue appeared on December 7, 1830, published twice a week. In\r\nits initial days the inevitable quarrel between Blair and Green\r\nsimmered, and while the “Globe” and the “Telegraph” were nervously\r\ntoying with their pistols, the actual fight did not commence until Green\r\npublished the Calhoun letters. Thereafter the contest was acrimonious\r\nand continuous. The immediate result of this battle was to impress\r\nBlair with the necessity of a daily publication, requiring a much larger\r\noutlay in money than either Blair or Kendall or both were able to\r\nadvance. This, however, did not discourage the plucky little Kentuckian\r\nin the least. He called upon the friends and supporters of Jackson in\r\nthe capital and throughout the country to subscribe for six hundred\r\ncopies and pay for them in advance at the rate of ten dollars per annum.\r\nThis money was easily collected, and thus, without the advance, by\r\nBlair, of a dollar of capital, the “Globe” was placed upon a firm and\r\nsure foundation.[366]\r\n\r\nThe journalistic genius of the little editor almost immediately gave the\r\npaper first rank in importance among all the papers then published in\r\nthe country. Some of his admirers have said that “he became the master\r\nof a style of composition that compared favorably with that of\r\nJunius.”[367] However that may be, he unquestionably was forceful,\r\nentertaining, and at times, eloquent. He could be dignified and\r\nargumentative without being dull. He knew how to appeal at once to the\r\nlover of pure English and the uneducated artisan of the city or the\r\nfrontiersman in the wilderness. He was a pioneer among the journalists\r\nwho have known how to produce a paper that would be as welcome on the\r\nlibrary table of the student as in the hut of the farmer on the\r\noutskirts of civilization. The secret of his strength was his direct\r\nmethod. There was nothing of equivocation or compromise in his\r\ncharacter. He did not qualify away all force for the sake of\r\nconservatism. He liked to cross the Rubicon, burn the bridges, and\r\ndevastate the country. Any one could understand precisely what he meant.\r\nHe was intense in his convictions, and he had the audacity, inseparable\r\nfrom political genius, to move in a straight line, prepared to meet the\r\nenemy even on ground of the latter’s choosing. His gift of satire and\r\nsarcasm was a joy to his fellow partisans who delighted in him. At first\r\nintended as their spokesman, he became their leader. Politicians soon\r\nlearned that it was not necessary to carry suggestions to the editor of\r\nthe “Globe”--they went to his sanctum to get them. Capable of a skillful\r\nuse of the rapier, he preferred the meat-axe. Nothing pleased him so\r\nmuch as the crushing of the skulls of the enemies of Jackson, and if\r\nthese should happen to be Democrats, all the greater was the joy of the\r\noperation.\r\n\r\nThis slashing, brilliant style delighted Jackson, who, strangely enough,\r\nhad a profound admiration for the fluent writer. The old warrior took\r\nhim to his bosom. That the editor of the “Court journal” should be\r\nmistaken was unthinkable to the President; and when any one asked him\r\nfor information on any subject with which he was unfamiliar, he would\r\ninvariably reply: “Go to Frank Blair--he knows everything.” And Jackson\r\nbelieved it. Firmly convinced that the people were entitled to all\r\npublic information, when any such came to his attention he would\r\ninstantly say, “Give it to Blair.”[368] He consulted the little ugly\r\nKentuckian constantly on all matters of domestic policy, on party\r\nmatters and patronage, and even on delicate points concerned with\r\ninternational programmes. The intimacy of this relationship soon\r\ntrickled down from the capital to the party workers in the most remote\r\nsections, and, in time, the paper took its place with the Bible in all\r\nwell-regulated Democratic households. Jackson himself is said to have\r\nread nothing during his Presidency but the Bible, his correspondence,\r\nand the “Globe.”[369] The Democratic press throughout the country got\r\nits cue from Blair’s editorials, and he, astute politician and\r\nadvertiser, took pains to cultivate intimate relations with all papers\r\nsupporting the Administration. Many articles, written by Kendall in the\r\noffice of the “Globe,” and sent to country papers for publication as\r\ntheir own, were afterwards collected and reproduced in the\r\nAdministration organ to indicate the trend of public opinion.\r\n\r\nNaturally the enemies of the Administration in Congress looked upon\r\nBlair and his paper with venomous hatred, and not without cause. No head\r\nwas too distinguished for his bludgeon, and it descended with resounding\r\nwhacks upon the craniums of the greatest as well as the least of these,\r\nleading to many furious protests and denunciations on the floor of the\r\nHouse and Senate. The “Congressional Globe” is thickly sprinkled with\r\nreferences to the paper. There was nothing of novelty in a statesman\r\nrising to a question of personal privilege to explain that the editor\r\nhad done him an injustice in describing him as a liar, an anarchist, or\r\na traitor. Occasionally Clay, or some lesser light, would rise to\r\nprotest against the action of the President in conveying information, to\r\nwhich the Congress was entitled, through the columns of his organ. Henry\r\nA. Wise would complain that “the Secretary of the Treasury has already\r\ninformed Congress and the country, through the columns of the ‘Globe’ of\r\nSaturday last,” that a certain policy would be pursued.[370] Or perhaps\r\nhe would merely desire to explain that a certain editorial was a “total\r\nperversion of the facts.”[371] Or maybe it was John Quincy Adams who\r\ntook the floor to describe the editor of the “Globe” as “the ambassador\r\nof the Executive,” an ambassador being “a distinguished person sent\r\nabroad to lie for the benefit of his country.”[372] One member would\r\nsecure recognition to “indignantly repel the charge made against him by\r\nthe ‘Globe’ of being an anarchist and a revolutionist.”[373] Even\r\nWebster was not impervious to the darts of the journalist, and did not\r\nthink it beneath his dignity formally to protest against an editorial\r\nparagraph, “flagitiously false,” which had reflected upon him as\r\nchairman of the Finance Committee.[374]\r\n\r\nWith the politicians, the country press, and the party leaders in the\r\nCongress treating the “Globe” as the editorial reflection of the\r\nPresident, it is not surprising that the diplomatic corps should have\r\naccepted the general assumption, and that the foreign offices of Europe\r\nshould have attached no little significance to any of its observations\r\non international affairs. Of the truth of this we have one very striking\r\nillustration.\r\n\r\nWhile Livingston was Secretary of State, James Buchanan was the American\r\nMinister at St. Petersburg, charged with the negotiation of a highly\r\nimportant commercial treaty. All went well until the terms of the treaty\r\nhad been practically agreed upon, when he had an interview with the\r\nbrilliant Count Nesselrode, Minister of Foreign Affairs, who protested\r\nagainst what he termed the unfriendly attitude of the American press\r\ntoward the Emperor and Russia, apropos of Poland. Not only, he\r\ncomplained, had the “Globe,” which he characterized as “the Government\r\npaper,” failed to correct the false impressions of the press generally,\r\nbut it “had itself been distinguished by falsehoods.” He hoped,\r\ntherefore, that the President “would adopt measures to remove this cause\r\nof complaint in the future, at least against the official paper in\r\nWashington.”[375] Recovering as quickly as possible from his\r\nastonishment, Buchanan explained that the press in the United States was\r\nnot subject to governmental supervision, but the practical-minded\r\nNesselrode was not at all impressed. He baldly charged that the “Globe”\r\n“formed an exception to the rule and was a paper over which the\r\nGovernment exercised a direct control.” Such being the Russian\r\nunderstanding, the Count was disappointed at the failure of Livingston,\r\nwhen he had met the Russian Minister to the United States in New York\r\nCity, to offer assurances that no more offensive articles would appear\r\nin that journal, and even more chagrined to learn, after that interview,\r\nthat the “Globe” had been “more violent than before.” Buchanan was\r\nforced to concede that the “Globe” was commonly called the “official\r\npaper,” but earnestly protested that it was free from governmental\r\ncontrol. He was “persuaded that even the influence of Mr. Livingston\r\nover the editor” was not much greater than his own, and he had no\r\ninfluence at all. Here Buchanan was on safe ground, but Nesselrode was\r\nnot so easily convinced. With a disconcerting smile of incredulity, he\r\nsuggested that “General Jackson himself must certainly have some\r\ninfluence over the editor.” Finding himself in a blind alley, Buchanan\r\nwas lamely admitting that the President might have such influence, when\r\nNesselrode, taking instant advantage of the admission, and without\r\nwaiting for the conclusion of the sentence, requested him to ask Jackson\r\nto “exercise it for the purpose of inducing the ‘Globe’ to pursue a more\r\ncautious course hereafter.” Buchanan, glad of the opportunity to drop\r\nthe subject, hastened to assure the Count that it would afford him great\r\npleasure “to make his wishes known to the President.”[376]\r\n\r\nThus, such was the genius of Blair and Kendall in impressing themselves\r\nupon the affairs of the Nation that, within three years after the\r\nestablishment of the “Globe,” they had become political powers in the\r\nRepublic, and so much international figures that their editorials were\r\ncarefully read in the foreign offices of Europe.\r\n\r\nOf the members of the Kitchen Cabinet, Lewis’s influence in determining\r\nthe political fate of men, and Hill’s in establishing the system of\r\nspoils, were of no small importance, but the publicity work of Blair and\r\nKendall, more than any other one thing, contributed to the solidarity of\r\nthe party, and the general popularity of Jackson and his measures.\r\nBenton, Van Buren, Forsyth, were masterful managers of Jackson’s\r\ncongressional battles, where he frequently lost to Clay, but the\r\npractical politicians of the Kitchen Cabinet, through the free use of\r\npatronage and the press, aroused and organized the masses with the\r\nballots for the succession of successful battles at the polls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nCLAY LEADS THE PARTY ONSLAUGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nHenry Clay sat in the little library at Ashland reading a letter from\r\nWebster. “You must be aware of the strong desire manifested in many\r\nparts of the country that you should come into the Senate,” the letter\r\nran. “The wish is entertained here as earnestly as elsewhere. We are to\r\nhave an interesting and arduous session. Everything is to be attacked.\r\nAn array is preparing much more formidable than has ever yet assaulted\r\nwhat we think the leading and important public interests. Not only the\r\ntariff, but the Constitution itself, in its elemental and fundamental\r\nprovisions, will be assailed with talent, vigor, and union. Everything\r\nis to be debated as if nothing had ever been settled. It would be an\r\ninfinite gratification to me to have your aid, or rather, your lead. I\r\nknow nothing so likely to be useful. Everything valuable in the\r\ngovernment is to be fought for and we need your arm in the fight.”\r\n\r\nThe meaning was perfectly clear to Clay. The man in the White House,\r\ncontrary to Whig expectations, was disclosing masterful qualities of\r\nleadership. The veto of the Maysville and Lexington Turnpike Bills had\r\nleft no room for doubt as to his attitude toward internal improvements.\r\nNo Executive had ever before so freely exercised the power of\r\npresidential rejection.[377] On the tariff he was known to favor such\r\nreasonable reductions as would conciliate the Southern States, and his\r\nbrief reference to the National Bank in his first Message, disconcerting\r\nin itself, had been followed by ominously hostile action on the part of\r\nseveral State Legislatures.[378] Meanwhile Jackson’s candidacy for\r\nreëlection was practically announced. Major Lewis, in his subterranean\r\nmanner, had been busy and with the usual results. The “New York Courier\r\nand Enquirer,” organ of Van Buren, was advocating his reëlection, and\r\nthe President’s followers, quietly encouraged by Kendall and Lewis, had\r\nplaced him in nomination in the legislatures of five States.\r\n\r\nUnder these conditions the old party of Adams grew restive and impatient\r\nfor a strong leader, and instinctively turned to the magnetic figure of\r\nAshland. Already his nomination for the Presidency in 1832 was a\r\nforegone conclusion. The enthusiastic acclaim which had greeted him on\r\nhis political tours during his retirement had impressed his sanguine\r\ntemperament as a sure omen of success. He would have preferred to have\r\nremained in retirement pending the election, but the party demand for\r\nhis leadership in Washington was insistent. The Opposition needed a\r\nfigure around which it could rally, and as a party leader Webster was a\r\nfailure. With much reluctance Clay decided to respond to the call. The\r\nelection in Kentucky had been a keen disappointment, and the enemies of\r\nthe Administration had a bare majority in the legislature, but it was\r\nenough, and he was elected.\r\n\r\nEarly in November he reached the capital, “borne up by the undying\r\nspirit of ambition,” looking “well and animated,” to be received with\r\n“the most marked deference and respect.”[379] From this time on,\r\nthroughout Jackson’s Presidency, he was to remain the brilliant,\r\nresourceful, bitter, and unscrupulous leader of the Opposition--as\r\nbrilliant and remarkable an Opposition as has ever confronted a\r\nGovernment in this or any other country.\r\n\r\nAnd such a politician! There have been few remotely like him, none his\r\nsuperior in personal popularity. His\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN C. CALHOUN\r\n\r\nHENRY CLAY\r\n\r\nDANIEL WEBSTER]\r\n\r\nunprecedented sway over a party was due, in large measure, to his\r\nremarkably fascinating personality, his audacity and dash, his amazing\r\npowers of ingratiation, and his superb eloquence which acted upon the\r\nspirit of the party workers like the sound of a bugle to a battle\r\ncharger. No American orator, perhaps, has ever approached his effect\r\nupon a partisan audience. Fluent, and at times capable of passages of\r\ninspired eloquence, a consummate master of the implements of sarcasm and\r\nridicule, his was the oratory that moves men to action. He could lash\r\nhis followers to fury or move them to tears. His speeches often lacked\r\nliterary finish, and, at times, in their colloquialisms descended\r\nbeneath the dignity of the man’s position, but even these occasional\r\ndescents to buffoonery contributed to his popularity. He often spoke the\r\nlanguage of the people--Webster and Calhoun, never. The contribution of\r\nnew ideas to a discussion was not his forte. But he could gather up the\r\nmaterial at hand, and weave it into a speech of fervent declamation\r\nwhich created the momentary impression that he was breaking virgin soil.\r\nHis oratory was in his personality and his delivery. His voice was an\r\nexquisite musical instrument, with a clarion note that carried his words\r\nto the outskirts of the greatest throng. When he spoke, his expressive\r\ncountenance glowed with his genius, his eyes flashed or caressed, his\r\ncommanding figure seemed to grow, and in his combined dignity and grace\r\nhe looked the part of the splendid commander of men, and the inspiring\r\ncrusader of a cause. No man of his time, among all the great orators of\r\nthat golden age, could so hold an audience literally spell-bound,\r\nPrentiss alone approaching him.\r\n\r\nIn personal intercourse, no politician ever possessed more of the\r\nseductive graces. There his magnetism was compelling. When he cared to\r\nput forth all his powers of attraction, no one could withstand his\r\ncharm. Webster was godlike and compelled admiration; Clay was human and\r\ncommanded love. Calhoun once said of him: “I don’t like Clay. He is a\r\nbad man, an impostor, a creature of wicked schemes. I won’t speak to\r\nhim, but, by God, I love him!” His effect on both men and women has been\r\nascribed to the fact that, masculine and virile though he was, he\r\npossessed feminine qualities that led to a sentimental feeling toward\r\nhim. Men would follow him, knowing him to be wrong; stake their\r\npolitical fortunes on him, though they knew it would mean their own\r\nundoing; and women wept over his defeats and idolized him as a god.\r\n\r\nAs a political leader he was an opportunist. He often changed his tack\r\nto meet the passing breeze, but with the exception of his Bank reversal\r\nnothing could force him to admit it. As we proceed with the story of the\r\nparty battles of the Jackson Administrations, we shall be impressed at\r\ntimes with his capability for trickery, demagogy, misrepresentation,\r\ndeliberate misinterpretation, and dogmatic arrogance with his own\r\nfriends and supporters. He brooked no equals. He accepted no rebuke and\r\nfew suggestions, and led his party with a high-handedness that would\r\nhave wrecked a lesser man.\r\n\r\nHis personal habits were not the best, and yet they were not of a nature\r\nthat greatly shocked his generation. Adams thought him “only half\r\neducated” and was disgusted by the looseness of his public and his\r\nprivate morals.[380] But Adams was not in harmony with his times. Clay\r\nwas an inveterate gambler--but so were a large portion of the public men\r\nin the Washington of the Thirties. And while a heavy drinker, he does\r\nnot appear to have often been noticeably under the influence, as was\r\nWebster. But these vices never interfered with his work or diverted him\r\nfor a moment from the pursuit of his ambition.\r\n\r\nIt was a militant figure that strode down the Avenue to the Capitol to\r\nlead the fight, with the stride of an Indian, his well-shaped feet\r\nencased in shoes instead of the boots generally worn at the time, and\r\nfastidiously attired as was his wont--a Henry Clay, in shining armor,\r\nhis sword shimmering.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nFive days after Congress convened, the Baltimore Convention nominated\r\nClay for the high office he long had sought. It had been inevitable from\r\nthe hour he rode out of Washington after the inauguration on his way to\r\nBaltimore. During his retirement, his letters of 1829 and 1830 furnish\r\nproof of his candidacy, albeit he carefully conveyed the impression that\r\nhe was a little indifferent to the nomination, and more than doubtful of\r\nthe result of the election.[381] In a letter to a political follower he\r\nearly predicted that if Jackson could unite New York, Virginia, and\r\nPennsylvania upon his candidacy, opposition would be futile.[382] Two\r\nmonths later, Webster assured him of the support of Massachusetts, but\r\nfeared that a first nomination from that State would “only raise the cry\r\nof coalition revived.”[383] And three days after his nomination at\r\nBaltimore, Clay had written of his skepticism of success, with the\r\nencouraging comment: “Something, however, may turn up (and that must be\r\nour encouraging hope) to give a brighter aspect to our affairs.”[384]\r\nThus, when he entered the Senate we may be sure that it was with the\r\nfixed determination that something should “turn up.” It was his belief,\r\nas we have seen, that Jackson’s election depended upon his ability to\r\ncarry Virginia, Pennsylvania, and New York. At the time he entertained\r\nno hope of diverting Virginia from Jackson, but he hoped to carry\r\nPennsylvania or New York, or both. Upon the former he pinned his\r\nfaith--and there the tariff was strong, and the National Bank had its\r\nheadquarters there, with its ramifications into every section of the\r\ncountry. His platform had been carefully thought out and thoroughly\r\ndiscussed in the correspondence of 1829 and 1830. It embraced internal\r\nimprovements, a protective tariff, and the rechartering of the Bank.\r\nThus, when Congress met, the Opposition candidate and his platform were\r\nbefore the people, and the congressional battles of the session were but\r\nheavy skirmishes preliminary to the battle for the Presidency.\r\n\r\nAs he looked over the personnel of Congress, Clay must have rejoiced\r\nover his advantage. There, by his side, sat Webster, with all the\r\nprestige of his great name and in all the splendor of his genius.\r\nPresiding still over the deliberations of the Senate was the\r\nstern-visaged political philosopher and sage who had definitely broken\r\nwith Jackson-Calhoun. It could not have taken him long to discover, in\r\nthe young Hercules with the harshly carven features, the brilliant\r\npossibilities of John M. Clayton. And there, harboring a secret grudge,\r\nand suffering acutely from the wounds inflicted on his mentor in the\r\nchair, sat the eloquent Hayne, meditating revenge. In Thomas Ewing of\r\nOhio, a robust partisan and able debater, he found a fighter after his\r\nown heart. And while they were of the State Rights persuasion, and\r\nhostile to the tariff and internal improvements, he could scarcely have\r\nfailed to catch in the eyes of the erudite Tazewell and Tyler of\r\nVirginia something of a promise that was to be fulfilled.\r\n\r\nAnd against him, he saw John Forsyth and Benton, men of character and\r\npower, supported by Felix Grundy and Hugh White, “Ike” Hill and Mahlon\r\nDickerson of New Jersey.\r\n\r\nHis was manifestly the advantage in the Senate.\r\n\r\nBut in the House his advantage was much greater, for among the members\r\nof the Opposition was the most brilliant array of great orators ever\r\nassembled in a single Congress. John Quincy Adams had reëntered public\r\nlife as a Representative from Quincy--as full of fire and pepper as ever\r\nin his youth; Edward Everett, the most scholarly and polished orator of\r\nhis generation; Rufus Choate, the greatest forensic orator the Republic\r\nhas produced; Richard Henry Wilde, who combined the qualities of a\r\ngraceful poet, a vigorous debater and eloquent orator, and a sound\r\nscholar; Tom Corwin, the wit and the slashing master of polemics; and\r\ngreater perhaps than all, as a congressional orator, the fiery and\r\nindomitable George McDuffie of South Carolina.\r\n\r\nAnd against this combination the best the Administration could do was to\r\nput forth the commonplace plodder James K. Polk, assisted by Churchill\r\nC. Cambreleng of New York.\r\n\r\nIf Jackson had the advantage of position, Clay had all the prestige of\r\ngenius on his side. Thus the two parties faced each other for the\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nA less provocative Message than that with which Jackson opened the\r\nCongress could hardly have been penned. It was conciliatory and in good\r\ntaste. But Clay’s voice was for war. It was his determination that\r\nsomething should “turn up,” if he had to turn it up, for the purposes of\r\nthe election, and he had instilled his spirit into his followers.\r\nInstantly the gage of battle was thrown down in the consideration of the\r\nnomination of Van Buren as Minister to England. A pettier piece of party\r\npolitics is scarcely found in the history of the Senate. Among all the\r\nOpposition Senators, there were probably none who doubted his capacity\r\nor questioned his integrity. With the Calhoun faction it was personal\r\nspite; with Clay, Webster, and Clayton it was partisan spleen. Six\r\nmonths before, Van Buren had ridden out of Washington with Jackson by\r\nhis side, and had sailed for England. In London he was at once received\r\ninto the most brilliant society. He became an intimate of the Duke of\r\nWellington, and Talleyrand, Ambassador from France, cultivated him,\r\nwhile Rogers, the poet, entertained him frequently at his famous\r\nbreakfasts. He had been charged with an important mission--nothing less\r\nthan the negotiation of an agreement that would prevent the recurrence\r\nof the causes of estrangement between the two peoples growing out of the\r\noccurrences incidental to England’s participation in European wars.[385]\r\nWelcomed to the most exclusive drawing-rooms, cultivated by the most\r\npowerful of English statesmen, with the prestige in London of having\r\nadjusted, while in the State Department, the long-standing differences\r\nrelative to the West Indian trade, he was in position to achieve\r\ntriumphs for his country when his nomination was sent to the Senate.\r\n\r\nAnd there, Clay, Webster, and Calhoun eagerly awaited its coming. They\r\nhad been busily engaged for weeks in preparing the attack. Each drew all\r\nhis particular friends into the conspiracy, many of them entering\r\nreluctantly rather than incur their displeasure. The charges against Van\r\nBuren were transparently political. The Calhoun faction were prepared to\r\ncontend that he had engineered the quarrel of the President and the\r\nVice-President and had disrupted the Cabinet. Clay’s special point was\r\nto be that he had introduced the policy of proscription, destined to\r\ndestroy American institutions, and he was to join with Webster in\r\nviciously assailing him for his instructions to our Minister to England\r\nin the negotiations on the West Indian trade.\r\n\r\nThe latter reason for refusing to confirm the nomination of Van Buren\r\nwas the only one that rose to the dignity of a pretense. For some time\r\nthe United States had been negotiating with London for the opening of\r\ntrade in American vessels between this country and the British\r\npossessions, but without success. During the preceding Administration,\r\nwhile Clay was Secretary of State, extravagant claims were advanced by\r\nthe American Government, and, by angering England, had only served to\r\nmake a settlement more remote. When Van Buren became Secretary of State,\r\nand McLane was sent to London, he was charged with the duty of\r\nreopening negotiations, and was given certain instructions for his\r\nguidance. Among these was the abandonment of the untenable claims of\r\nClay, and the concession of the British point of view upon them. This\r\nwas denounced as a weakness and a surrender, and as an intentional\r\nreflection upon the previous Administration for party purposes. As a\r\nmatter of record, the instructions furnished McLane by Van Buren were\r\npredicated upon the report submitted to Clay, after the failure of the\r\npreceding negotiations, by Albert Gallatin, the Minister to England\r\nunder Adams.[386] It consequently follows that when Clay, thoroughly\r\nfamiliar with his own Minister’s report to him, and with the fact that\r\nVan Buren had merely followed it in his preparation of the instructions,\r\nvehemently denounced the latter for deliberately and maliciously\r\nreflecting upon the previous Administration, he was tricking the Senate\r\nand the country. He, at least, knew better. And the mere fact that\r\nMcLane was further instructed to stress the fact that the preceding\r\nAdministration had been repudiated by the people at the polls, and the\r\nnew régime should not be held accountable for the mistakes of the old,\r\nwhile in doubtful taste, was scarcely an offense so heinous as to\r\njustify the proposed humiliation of Van Buren.[387] The other charges\r\nhad less substance. It has never been convincingly shown that Van Buren\r\nhad any part in engineering the quarrel between Jackson and Calhoun, and\r\nyears after retiring from the Presidency, Jackson solemnly exonerated\r\nhim from any complicity.[388] Equally unproved, and unprovable, was the\r\nclaim that he had precipitated the Cabinet crisis, and the charge that\r\nhe had introduced the policy of proscription might well have emanated\r\nfrom some one other than Clay.\r\n\r\nThe clear intent of the conspiracy was to destroy Van Buren and his\r\nprospects for the Presidency.\r\n\r\nWhen the nomination reached the Senate, nothing was done for five weeks.\r\nMeanwhile the leaders of the conspiracy were carefully preparing their\r\nspeeches for publication and wide distribution. On the submission of the\r\nreport, the venom behind the remarkable procrastination was revealed in\r\na resolution, entrusted to one of the lesser lights,[389] to recommit\r\nthe nomination with instructions to investigate the disruption of the\r\nCabinet and whether Van Buren had “participated in any practices\r\ndisreputable to the national character.” This, offered as a weak\r\ncontribution to the attempt to blacken Van Buren’s reputation, having\r\nserved its purpose, was withdrawn without action. Then the orators\r\nbegan. One after another, with a cheap simulation of sorrowful regret\r\nover the necessity of injuring an amiable man, poured forth his protest\r\nagainst the nomination. Clay, of course, made a slashing onslaught.\r\nWebster confined himself to attacking the victim because of his\r\ninstructions to McLane. Clayton and Ewing, Hayne and seven others\r\nrecited their elaborately prepared partisan harangues under the\r\napproving eye of Calhoun in the chair.\r\n\r\nThe principal reply, and only four were made, was that of Senator\r\nJohn Forsyth, the accomplished floor leader of the Administration,\r\nand one of the most eloquent and resourceful of men. He vigorously\r\nprotested against a partisan crucifixion, and sarcastically commended\r\nthe fine public spirit of Senators who could voluntarily bring such\r\ndistress upon themselves to serve the public good. This fling went\r\nhome to many. Hayne, in later years, admitted that he had spoken and\r\nvoted against his judgment at the behest of party,[390] and John\r\nTyler, who was incapable of a pose, voted for the confirmation,\r\n“not that I liked the man overmuch,” but because he could find no\r\nprinciple to justify his rejection, and did not care to join “the\r\nnotoriously factious opposition ... who oppose everything favored by\r\nthe Administration.”[391] Indeed, the cooler and wiser heads among the\r\nenemies of the Administration considered the attack a serious political\r\nblunder. Adams, on learning of the plan, warned that “to reject the\r\nnomination would bring him [Van Buren] back with increased power to\r\ndo mischief here.”[392] And Thurlow Weed, of the “Albany Journal,”\r\nuncannily wise and prophetic, sounded a solemn warning through his\r\neditorial columns that such persecution of Van Buren “would change the\r\ncomplexion of his prospects from despair to hope.” The plan persisted\r\nin, and “he would return home as a persecuted man, and throw himself\r\nupon the sympathy of the party, be nominated for Vice-President, and\r\nhuzzahed into office at the heels of General Jackson.”[393]\r\n\r\nThis was the view of Kendall and Blair, and of Benton, who refused to\r\nparticipate in the Senate debate. The latter felt that, though\r\n“rejection was a bitter medicine, there was health at the bottom of the\r\ndraught.” He alone among the senatorial friends of the rejected Minister\r\nappears to have had the prescience to appreciate the ultimate advantage.\r\nTo one Senator, rejoicing over the rejection, he turned with triumphant\r\nmien: “You have broken a Minister and made a Vice-President.” But the\r\nenemies of the Administration and of the victim were jubilant. “It will\r\nkill him, sir, kill him dead; he will never kick, sir, never kick,”\r\nexclaimed Calhoun in the presence of “Old Bullion.”[394] And there was\r\nan immediate reaction. Instead of killing, it made Van Buren. He\r\ninstantly became a party martyr, and idol.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the day the news of his rejection reached London, Van\r\nBuren appeared at a party at Talleyrand’s, smiling, suave, undisturbed,\r\nas though he had scored a triumph. It was probably on that day that he\r\nheard from Benton, urging that he hold himself free for the\r\nVice-Presidency.\r\n\r\nThe speeches of Clay, Webster, Hayne, and Clayton were published, the\r\nveil of secrecy having been lifted from the executive session for this\r\nparty purpose, and the effect was wholly different from that expected.\r\nIt had been the part of Kendall and Blair to see to that. While the\r\nSenators were talking, they had been busy with their pens, and when the\r\naction was taken the Democratic press furiously denounced the rejection,\r\nthe rank and file of the party rose _en masse_ to proclaim the victim a\r\nmartyr, mass meetings were called in New York, Philadelphia, and Albany\r\nto arraign the Senate, and the Democratic members of the New York\r\nLegislature sent the President a letter of condolence. The Legislature\r\nof New Jersey declared that after its favorite son, Senator Dickerson,\r\nits choice for Vice-President would be the martyr. And Isaac Hill took\r\nthe stump in New Hampshire to denounce Webster as disloyal to friendship\r\nand as a sniveling hypocrite.[395]\r\n\r\nBut the success of the conspiracy acted upon Clay like the taste of\r\nblood on a tiger, and with an insinuative reference to Livingston’s\r\nindebtedness to the Government, which he knew had been discharged to the\r\npenny, he would have applied the political proscription of the Whigs to\r\nthe philosopher in the State Department but for the indignant protest of\r\nDallas. Thus the character of the fight to be waged against the\r\nAdministration was clearly revealed within a month after Clay’s return\r\nto public life.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nThe first month, too, witnessed an assault on the most vulnerable point\r\nof the Administration lines, and an open invitation to Calhoun and the\r\nNullifiers to join their political fortunes with the party of Clay.\r\nBoth the attack and the invitation came from John M. Clayton, who was\r\nalmost to rival Clay in the leadership of the Whigs, and to surpass him\r\nin some of the qualities of leadership. When he entered the Senate\r\npractically unknown, he was the youngest member of that body, but there\r\nwas enough in his physical appearance and bearing to set him out in any\r\ngroup as one destined to command. Over six feet in height, his figure\r\nwell filled out; of clear complexion, with large gray eyes of\r\nintellectual power, and an enormous, superbly shaped head, he looked\r\nboth the physical and mental giant. It only required the personal\r\ncontact to attract men to him as steel shavings are attracted to the\r\nmagnet. His manner was easy and graceful, his disposition kindly and\r\nbenevolent, his wit keen, his conversational powers far beyond the\r\naverage. With a remarkable memory and an unusual gift for analysis, he\r\nentered the Senate well equipped in a thorough knowledge of literature\r\nand history. He had great talents and just fell short of genius. As an\r\norator, he was logical, forceful, at times dramatic and eloquent. Hating\r\nthe Jacksonians, he surveyed the field for an opportunity to attack, and\r\nhe found it in the Post-Office Department.\r\n\r\nOne of Jackson’s most unfortunate appointments had been that of Barry as\r\nPostmaster-General. A genial and likable politician, a loyal friend, an\r\nardent champion of the President, and, personally, a man of undoubted\r\nintegrity, he was pitifully lacking in business ability, in a capacity\r\nfor organization, and was all too credulous of his subordinates. Within\r\ntwo years after Jackson’s inauguration, the politicians knew that his\r\ndepartment offered a rich field for investigation. Knowing this, Clayton\r\nintroduced his celebrated resolution inquiring into its abuses. That the\r\nAdministration circles were not at all satisfied that nothing could be\r\nuncovered is evident in the excitement the resolution caused, and every\r\neffort was made by Administration Senators to block it. In his initial\r\nspeech in support of his resolution, Clayton sounded the keynote of the\r\nWhig campaign against the prescriptive policies of Jackson, but more\r\nsignificant still was his appeal, the first openly made, to Calhoun, to\r\njoin with the followers of Clay in a concerted assault upon the\r\nAdministration.\r\n\r\nWhile the young Senator from Delaware was speaking, Calhoun sat in the\r\nchair of the presiding officer. Turning in his direction, Clayton made\r\nthe first bold bid for his support of the party Opposition.\r\n\r\n“But it will be seen,” he said, “whether there be not one man in this\r\nnation to breast its [Administration’s] terrors whenever the President\r\nhurls his thunders. There are hawks abroad, sir. Rumor alleges that that\r\nplundering falcon has recently swooped upon a full-fledged eagle that\r\nnever yet flinched from a contest, and, as might be naturally expected,\r\nall await the result with intense interest. It is given out that the\r\nintended victim of proscription now is one distinguished far above all\r\nin office for the vigor and splendor of his intellect.... But if that\r\nintegrity and fairness which have heretofore characterized him through\r\nlife do not desert him in this hour of greatest peril, we may yet live\r\nto see one, who has been marked out as a victim, escape unscathed even\r\nby that power which has thus far prostrated alike the barriers of public\r\nlaw and the sanctity of private reputation.”\r\n\r\nThe appeal was entirely unnecessary, if not intended merely as a public\r\ntribute to a newly acquired ally, for Calhoun and his friends were\r\nalready hostile to the Administration. It is historically interesting\r\nonly in that it shows the cleverness of the National Republicans, soon\r\nto adopt the name of Whigs, in undertaking to coalesce with all elements\r\nof the Opposition, no matter how divergent, or even inconsistent, the\r\ncauses leading to the disaffection.\r\n\r\nThus, within a few weeks after the assumption of the leadership by Clay,\r\nwe find Jackson’s favorite humiliated by the rejection of his\r\nnomination; another wantonly insulted by the questioning of his personal\r\nintegrity; a movement launched to blacken the Administration through an\r\ninvestigation of its most vulnerable department; and a plan conceived\r\nfor the consummation of an unholy alliance of incongruous elements.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Clay, devoted to the protective tariff policy, anxious to save\r\nit from crucifixion by consent, and with a political eye on the\r\npolitical effect of his championship in Pennsylvania, without which he\r\nthought Jackson’s reëlection impossible, had been busy formulating a new\r\ntariff which was to create more party clashes.\r\n\r\nWithin a month after Congress met, he called a meeting of the friends of\r\nthe protective tariff to determine plans for party action. The then\r\nexisting “tariff of abominations”[396] was doomed by public opinion. Two\r\nmonths before he wrote a friend acknowledging a revision inevitable, and\r\nannouncing plans for one not compromising to the protective\r\nprinciple.[397] The conference called by Clay met at the home of Edward\r\nEverett, Representative from Boston, with the presidential nominee\r\nhimself presiding. He summoned his friends, not to consult, but to take\r\norders. He disclosed his plan--a repeal of all duties on tea, coffee,\r\nspices, indigo, and similar articles, and thereby reduce the revenue as\r\nmuch as seven millions that year without interfering with the prevailing\r\nduties that had been imposed for protective purposes. Jackson intended\r\nto destroy the protective system through the accumulation of revenue. It\r\nwas the duty of its friends to save it through the reductions proposed.\r\n\r\nIf we may accept Adams as a faithful reporter, Clay’s manner was\r\n“exceedingly peremptory and dogmatical.” Various questions, indicative\r\nof doubt, were asked. Everett, mindful of the ominous protest of the\r\nSouth, thought the plan might be interpreted as “setting the South at\r\ndefiance.” Adams, who had a mind of his own, reported that the Committee\r\non Manufactures in the House, of which he was chairman, was “already\r\ncommitted upon the principle that the reduction of the duties should be\r\nprospective, and not to commence until after the extinguishment of the\r\npublic debt”; and he suggested that the Clay plan would be, not only “a\r\ndefiance of the South, but of the President and the Administration.” The\r\nspirit of Clay is well disclosed in his none too gracious reply that “to\r\npreserve, maintain, and strengthen the American System, he would defy\r\nthe South, the President, and the Devil; that if the Committee on\r\nManufactures had committed themselves ... they had given a very foolish\r\nand improvident pledge; and that there was no necessity for the payment\r\nof the debt by the 4th of March, 1833.”\r\n\r\nThis led to some debate between the former President and his premier,\r\nwith Adams insisting that Jackson’s desire to extinguish the debt should\r\nbe “indulged and not opposed,” and that the President’s idea “would take\r\ngreatly with the people.” This view piqued and mortified Clay, who had\r\nfound all the party leaders in the conference becomingly obsequious with\r\nthe exception of Adams. That Adams was equally disgusted we may gather\r\nfrom his description of Clay’s manner as “super-presidential,” and from\r\nthe following entry in his journal: “Clay’s motives are obvious. He\r\nsees, that next November, at the choice of presidential electors, the\r\ngreat and irresistible electioneering cry will be the extinguishment of\r\nthe public debt. By instant repeal of the duties he wants to withdraw\r\nseven or eight millions from the Treasury and make it impossible to\r\nextinguish it by the 3rd of March, 1833. It is an electioneering\r\nmovement, and this was the secret of these movements, as well as of the\r\ndesperate efforts to take the whole business of the reduction of the\r\ntariff into his own hands.”[398] The Democratic opinion that Clay was\r\npartly actuated by a petty partisan desire to deprive the Administration\r\nof the credit for wiping out the national debt, corroborated as it is by\r\nAdams, is plausible enough. At the same time, it was manifestly Clay’s\r\npurpose to rally the protected industries to his standard in the\r\npresidential campaign.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the lobbyists of the protected interests, flocking to the\r\ncapital, crowded the rotunda every morning, mixing with the statesmen.\r\nHere, at the time, was the Republic in miniature--lobbyists, statesmen,\r\ncorrespondents, and plebeians mingling in a common arena, with the\r\nvisiting tourists ranged about to view the celebrities in their moments\r\nof conversational unbending.[399] Clay made the presentation of his plan\r\nthe opportunity for his first political speech of his campaign. The\r\nSenate was crowded to hear him. It was not enough that he should\r\nacknowledge the approach of the extinguishment of the public debt, and\r\nbase his argument for the reduction of duties upon that fact. The\r\npossibility of the passing of the debt during the Administration of\r\nJackson was clearly annoying, and he attempted, laboriously, and at\r\nconsiderable length, to deprive it of any credit. The plan of the\r\nAdministration to reduce no duties on unprotected articles previous to\r\nMarch, 1833, and to make a gradual and prospective reduction on\r\nprotected articles, he denounced as a scheme to “destroy the protecting\r\nsystem by a slow but certain poison.” There was nothing remarkable in\r\nhis first speech except its affectation of modesty, and his reference to\r\nold age and declining power.\r\n\r\nBut he was soon to find the incentive for his greatest speech upon the\r\ntariff. Hayne attacked the protective system with all the vigor and\r\nvenom of a Nullificationist in the making; and Clay replied in the\r\nbrilliant fighting protectionist speech which ranks as one of the\r\nmasterful efforts of his life, and was to be used as a textbook for the\r\nadvocates of the system for fifty years. Read even to-day, after the\r\nlapse of almost a century, it has a familiar sound, and transmits its\r\npulsations from the printed page as though the reader felt the heartbeat\r\nof the orator.\r\n\r\nAmong the Southerners in the Senate, this speech created the greatest\r\nexcitement and the gravest forebodings, with John Tyler assailing both\r\nthe principle of protection and the method of framing bills under the\r\nprinciple. But the most significant note struck by Tyler was the warning\r\nthat the continuance of the protective policy would inevitably lead to\r\nthe disruption of the Union. The speeches of both Clay and Tyler were\r\nsent broadcast over the country. That of the former delighted\r\nprotectionists and impressed all. Harrison Gray Otis wrote\r\nenthusiastically from Boston, but both James Madison and James Barbour\r\ngently questioned the taste of the partisan attack on Albert Gallatin as\r\na “foreigner.”[400] Highly complimentary letters were received by Tyler\r\nfrom John Marshall and James Madison, both of whom favored the reduction\r\nof the tariff.[401]\r\n\r\nAnd throughout it all, Clay found himself unable to maneuver Jackson or\r\nhis friends into a position of opposition to the system. Amos Kendall\r\nand Blair had their hopes tied to another issue. They had no thought of\r\nsacrificing the electoral vote of the Keystone State. The leaders of the\r\nSenate opposition to the tariff were Hayne and Tyler, neither of whom\r\nwas longer considered as in the confidence of the President. Clay’s\r\nspeech, widely distributed in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and New York, proved\r\nhim a champion of the system, but nothing occurred in the Senate to\r\nprove Jackson an enemy. This was the situation when the real battle was\r\ntransferred to the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nThrough some trickery or blunder, that portion of the Presidential\r\nMessage relating to “relieving the people from unnecessary taxation\r\nafter the extinguishment of the public debt,” was referred to the\r\nCommittee on Ways and Means a majority of whose members were hostile to\r\nthe protective system; and to the Committee on Manufactures was referred\r\nthat part concerning “manufactures and the modification of the\r\ntariff”--a dual reference of the same subject to rival committees. At\r\nthe head of the Committee on Manufactures was John Quincy\r\nAdams--certainly not a spokesman of the Administration; and the chairman\r\nof the Committee on Ways and Means was George McDuffie of South\r\nCarolina, a protégé of Calhoun, and now an implacable foe of Jackson.\r\n\r\nIn feverish haste McDuffie, representing the extreme free-trade school,\r\nbegan the preparation of his report and the formulation of his bill to\r\nget in before the more deliberate Adams. He proceeded independently of\r\nthe forthcoming report and tentative Administration measure from\r\nSecretary McLane, such was his precipitation. Adams, more considerate,\r\nawaited the report, in the meanwhile making many morning calls upon the\r\nSecretary.[402] Strangely enough, the former President had favorably\r\nimpressed many Southerners by his admission that existing rates were\r\nunfair to the South. His position, as on a more notable occasion later,\r\nwas unique. Even Jackson was actively making overtures to him. The\r\never-convenient Colonel Johnson of Tecumseh fame, approaching the old\r\nPuritan with a suggestion of a reconciliation, tactfully hinted that he\r\nthought the President should make the first move. The cautious Adams,\r\nnot at all averse, reminded the emissary that Jackson had broken, not\r\nhe; to which Johnson replied that the General had been poisoned by\r\n“scoundrel office-seekers” when he first reached the capital. Would\r\nAdams dine at the White House, if invited? The wily old man parried with\r\nthe reminder that such would only be the courtesy customarily accorded\r\nall members. But would Adams dine at the White House with a small and\r\nselect company? He would not--and on similar grounds. At the end of his\r\nrope, the anxious Johnson asked Adams for a suggestion, only to receive\r\nthe reply that it was a matter for Jackson to decide.[403] The next day\r\nAdams received a note from Johnson to the effect that Jackson had\r\n“expressed great satisfaction” over the conversation and sent his\r\n“personal regards and friendship,” together with the assurance that he\r\nwas “anxious to have social and friendly intercourse restored.” Thinking\r\nit over, the suspicious Adams could not but meditate upon the attacks\r\nfrom Clay’s friends if he should cross the threshold of the White\r\nHouse--and there the matter appears to have rested finally.[404]\r\n\r\nThere has never been another character in American history quite like\r\nAdams. His real portrait, self-painted, peers at the world from between\r\nthe covers of his monumental diary, in which he communed with himself\r\nunreservedly, and expressed his opinion of men and their motives with\r\nbrutal frankness. He was a professional statesman of a high order.\r\nEntering upon diplomatic duties in his youth, he knew the cross-currents\r\nof world politics at an age when most Americans are laboriously\r\nprojecting themselves into the politics of their immediate neighborhood.\r\nFrom his earliest years he had been in contact with great minds, and\r\nwith men of power and broad vision. A thorough scholar, he was, at the\r\nsame time, a man of the world. Conscious of his ability and his\r\nadvantages, cold and reserved, and dignified to the point of frigidity,\r\nit is not difficult to understand his supercilious attitude toward men\r\nless favored, and yet placed in lofty station. Inspired by the highest\r\nideals of public service, holding himself under such rigid discipline as\r\nto have made himself immune to the small vices, placing duty above\r\nfriendship, scarcely ever yielding his dignity to mirth, and on those\r\nrare occasions smiling sardonically, he stood upon an isolated peak--of\r\nhumanity, and yet separated from it.[405] No one living the monastic\r\nlife could have lived more by rule, or have scourged himself more\r\nfaithfully to his tasks.\r\n\r\nOf friendships, he knew little from experience. Naturally of a\r\nsuspicious disposition, he suspected treachery where it was not. Holding\r\nto no ordinary standard of perfection, he could not forgive the\r\nimperfections of his fellows. Even the transcendent genius of Clay could\r\nnot hide from him the great man’s lack of education. One searches the\r\npages of his diary in eager quest of some complimentary\r\nreferences--there are scarcely any. That he bitterly realized his\r\nisolation is clearly disclosed. “I am a man of reserve,” he wrote,\r\n“cold, austere and forbidding manners. My political adversaries say a\r\ngloomy misanthrope; my personal enemies, an unsocial savage. With a\r\nknowledge of the actual defects of my character, I have not had the\r\npliability to reform it.” That such a man, entertaining such an opinion\r\nof his own merits and the failings of his contemporaries, should have\r\nconsented to serve in the lower House of Congress, after having served\r\nin the Presidency, can only mean that he loved his country and sought\r\nthe opportunity for service. That it was not to punish his enemies, we\r\nshall find on more than one occasion when he took his stand with the\r\nAdministration of the man who displaced him. Not least among the merits\r\nof Adams was his capacity to work in serious coöperation with McLane in\r\nthe moulding of the tariff of 1832.\r\n\r\nQuite a different type, and in some respects a greater genius, was\r\nGeorge McDuffie. His career was a mingling of romance and tragedy. A\r\nchild of poverty, the protégé of a Calhoun,[406] he had while yet in\r\ncollege been regarded “as a young man of extraordinary talents,” albeit\r\nat that time “he had not that passionate and eloquent declamation which\r\nhe was afterwards to display in Congress.”[407] After hearing his great\r\nspeech on the tariff in 1827, Josiah Quincy, who heard him, described\r\nhim as “the most sensational orator of the time.”[408] In the fight\r\nagainst the Panama Mission, Sargent thought him “decidedly the most\r\nviolent and aggressive speaker arrayed against the Administration.”[409]\r\nHis passionate and impulsive nature frequently led to personal\r\nencounters; and in reaching an understanding of his irritable and sour\r\ndisposition, it is profitable to know that just before entering Congress\r\nhe had been wounded in the spine in a duel, and never afterwards knew a\r\nday free from personal discomfort. This wound, which ultimately killed\r\nhim, changed a good-tempered and jovial man into the irritable, morose,\r\nand nervous creature known to history.[410] The indifference of the\r\nprotectionists to the interests of the South, and the intemperate\r\nattacks of the abolitionists upon the Southern people, acted upon the\r\ndiseased genius as an irritant and drove him to extremes. Even so, he\r\nrejected Nullification as a remedy, and insisted that the sole recourse\r\nof the Southerners was revolution.[411] Intellectually honest, morally\r\nclean, physically ailing, he put such of himself as he cared for the\r\nworld to see into his public acts. He withdrew into himself--taciturn,\r\nlonely. “A spare, grim looking man, who was an admirer of Milton, and\r\nwho was never known to smile or jest,” as Perley Poore describes\r\nhim.[412] His health gone, his life uncertain, an idolized wife taken\r\nfrom him within a year, his leader’s aspirations wrecked, his section\r\nthreatened, it is not strange that he poured forth on Andrew Jackson\r\nsuch torrents of eloquent vituperation.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nStanding not on ceremony, McDuffie hastened to report a bill,\r\naccompanied by an elaborate report in the nature of an indictment of the\r\nprotective system, which “ought to be abandoned with all convenient and\r\npractical despatch, upon every principle of justice, patriotism and\r\nsound policy.” The bill provided an immediate reduction of duties on all\r\narticles except iron, steel, salt, cotton-bagging, hemp and flax, and on\r\neverything made of cotton, wool, and iron, to a basis of twenty-five per\r\ncent ad valorem. On the excepted articles the reduction was to be\r\ngradual, tumbling to twenty-five per cent at once, to eighteen and three\r\nquarters per cent on June 30, 1833, and to twelve and a half per cent\r\none year later.\r\n\r\nWith Adams still laboring on his bill, McDuffie called his up with a\r\nslashing speech. This prodigiously long philippic was historical in that\r\nit tended to force the issue of Nullification a little earlier than its\r\nsponsors had planned.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile the Administration measure, with McLane’s report, had\r\nbeen submitted, providing for the repeal of the existing tariff after\r\nMarch 3, 1833, and the reduction of the revenue to the financial\r\nrequirements of the Government. This contemplated the reduction of the\r\nrevenue to $12,000,000 a year, and the arrangement of the rates so as\r\nsufficiently to protect the great interests involved.\r\n\r\nUsing the Administration measure as a basis, Adams thereupon prepared\r\nhis bill and report. In his statement the patriotic statesman,\r\nindifferent to the clamor of party, or class, or section, shines forth\r\nluminously. It may have been unnecessary to expose the protectionist’s\r\nfallacy that raising the duties lowers the price of the domestic\r\nproduct; equally unnecessary to warn the Southerners that a persistence\r\nin their course would lead to appalling consequences, but he made these\r\npoints. In presenting his bill, Adams frankly explained that it was\r\nbased on the Administration measure, with some changes as to details.\r\n\r\nWith the Adams bill before it, the House made short shrift of the\r\nMcDuffie measure. The protectionists were in despair. The Legislatures\r\nof Pennsylvania and Connecticut passed condemnatory resolutions, and\r\nmass meetings were held protesting against reductions. An unsuccessful\r\nattempt was made to substitute the Clay Senate plan. And yet Clay\r\nhimself was fairly well satisfied, and on its passage in the House wrote\r\nthat “with some alterations it will be a very good measure of\r\nprotection.”[413] At the time he wrote, however, he was convinced that\r\nthe alterations would be made in the Senate and accepted by the House,\r\nand upon the failure of these plans to materialize hangs another story\r\nof politics.\r\n\r\nThe Senate lost no time making amendments, and as it was now July, with\r\nall anxious to adjourn, no time was wasted on unnecessary speeches, and\r\nthe amendments, which were numerous, were hurried through. In a few\r\ninstances, not many, the protectionists lost, but on the whole theirs\r\nwas the victory when the bill went back to the House. There a few of the\r\nSenate amendments were accepted, but the majority were rejected and the\r\nbill was thrown into conference.\r\n\r\nAnd here enters one of the comedy-tragedies of politics. Calhoun was\r\nabsent, Tazewell in the chair, when the measure was returned to the\r\nSenate. The motion for a conference carried. And then it was, in the\r\nnaming of the Senate conferees, that Tazewell either made a blunder or\r\nturned a trick. Hayne, named as the minority member, was expected to act\r\nbadly, but the protectionists pinned implicit faith in Wilkins of\r\nPennsylvania and Dickerson of New Jersey, the former a business man,\r\nmanufacturer, banker from a protectionist State, the latter with a\r\npowerful protectionist constituency. Unhappily the friends of the Senate\r\nbill did not attach sufficient importance to the candidacy of both men\r\nfor the Vice-Presidential nomination with Jackson--to the pull of\r\npersonal ambition. Whatever their special motives in surrendering to the\r\nconferees of the House, they gave only a perfunctory support to the\r\nSenate amendments and capitulated.\r\n\r\nThe amazement and indignation of Clay and his followers were unbounded.\r\nClay sharply cross-examined Wilkins and Dickerson upon the proceedings\r\nin the conference, and then had to content himself by joining Webster in\r\na warm denunciation of the surrender. There was nothing to be done,\r\nhowever, but for the Senate to recede, and the bill was passed and\r\npromptly signed by Jackson.\r\n\r\nThus the tariff battle on which Clay relied to strengthen him in the\r\npre-presidential contest was practically barren of party significance.\r\nBy no sophistry or reasoning could the protectionist States of\r\nPennsylvania and New York be turned against Jackson, who had promptly\r\nsigned the bill that Adams had sponsored, and which had been supported\r\nby such Administration Democrats as Isaac Hill, Dickerson, Marcy,\r\nWilkins, Grundy, White, and Benton.\r\n\r\nThe tariff issue was dead before the campaign was fairly begun.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nIf Clay had failed to embarrass the Administration on the tariff, the\r\nkeen Jacksonian politicians were to be more successful in embarrassing\r\nClay on the land question. This was a peculiarly delicate subject for\r\nClay to touch in the midst of the campaign. In the Southern and Western\r\nStates more than 1,090,000,000 acres remained the property of the\r\nNational Government--a vast empire. The proceeds from the sale of these\r\nlands had been originally dedicated to the payment of the national debt;\r\nand now with the extinguishment of the debt in sight, all manner of\r\nschemes were advanced as to the future disposition of the lands and the\r\nproceeds. For a number of years Benton, with characteristic tenacity,\r\nhad been urging his plan of graduated prices, with free grants to actual\r\nsettlers, and he had won Jackson over to his theory with Edmund Burke’s\r\nproposition, advanced in his speech on the disposition of the crown\r\nlands in England, that the principal revenue to be had from uncultivated\r\ntracts “springs from the improvement of the population of the kingdom.”\r\nThe sturdy Missourian looked with repugnance upon the idea of\r\nconsidering these uncultivated acres as sources of revenue, rather than\r\nas an opportunity for settlers, and he gradually converted the\r\nDemocratic Party to his point of view.\r\n\r\nTo make matters all the more embarrassing to Clay, his party had been\r\nplaced in the position of deliberately withholding this vast domain from\r\nthe axe of the pioneer and the spade of the cultivator, in the interest\r\nof the manufacturers of the East. This had resulted from the unfortunate\r\nwording of an official report of Richard Rush, a colleague of Clay’s in\r\nthe Cabinet of Adams, in which he had lamented the preference of the\r\nAmerican people for agricultural over manufacturing pursuits. The report\r\nhad been referred to Clay whose practiced political eye instantly saw\r\nthe possibilities in the perversion or exaggeration of the meaning of\r\nthese paragraphs, and he had fruitlessly urged their elimination. The\r\nDemocrats were quick to grasp their opportunity. The protectionists,\r\nClay and his friends, planned that the National Government should, by\r\nholding on to the lands, retard their settlement by maintaining prices\r\nprohibitive to the settler; they proposed to maintain a large labor\r\nmarket in the industrial labor centers of the East where competition\r\nwould be keen enough to keep down wages. For the sake of the protected\r\ninterests, they were ready to sacrifice the opportunities of the poor of\r\nthe Eastern cities and make them the galley slaves of the factories;\r\nretard the development of the West, and immolate the national interest\r\non the altar of greed. And there was just enough truth in these charges,\r\nrather luridly put forth, to make them exceedingly dangerous in a\r\npresidential year.\r\n\r\nThe issue had been accentuated by the suggestion of McLane, Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury, that the public lands should be sold to the States in\r\nwhich they were located, and the proceeds apportioned among all the\r\nStates in the Union. This, naturally enough, made an instant appeal to\r\nthe States most intimately concerned, and six of the new Commonwealths\r\nhastened to petition Congress for the cession. This brought the subject\r\nbefore the Senate, and in the spring of 1832 two motions were submitted,\r\none to inquire into the wisdom of reducing the price of the public\r\nlands, the other into the expediency of the McLane proposition.\r\n\r\nAnd it was at this juncture that the Jacksonians turned the trick on\r\nClay and forced him into the open as an aggressive enemy of the wishes\r\nof the new States. With a regular Senate Committee on Public Lands,\r\ncomposed of men intimately acquainted with the subject, the amazing\r\nmotion was made and carried that the matter be referred to the Committee\r\non Manufactures of which Clay was chairman. The friends of the candidate\r\nbitterly protested against the reference; and Clay himself “protested,”\r\n“entreated,” and “implored” that the reference be changed to the\r\nCommittee on Public Lands. “I felt,” he said later, “that the design was\r\nto place in my hands a many-edged instrument which I could not touch\r\nwithout being wounded.”[414]\r\n\r\nUnable to extricate himself from the embarrassment, Clay set to work,\r\nand in a short time submitted a report, accompanied by a bill, providing\r\nagainst the reduction of the price of the land, but for granting to\r\nOhio, Indiana, Illinois, Alabama, Missouri, and Mississippi twelve and a\r\nhalf per cent of the proceeds from the sale of lands within their\r\nborders, to be applied to the purposes of education and internal\r\nimprovements. This, of course, was a frank attempt to prevent the\r\nresentment of the people of these States from asserting itself at the\r\npolls. The remainder of the proceeds was then to be apportioned to the\r\nremaining States, according to their population, to be used for the\r\nschools, internal improvements, and negro colonization. The act was to\r\nremain in force for five years, provided no war intervened, in which\r\nevent all the proceeds were to be used in defraying the expenses of the\r\nconflict. In this way Clay attempted to maintain the existing economic\r\nconditions while satisfying the new States whose electoral votes he\r\nsought.\r\n\r\nIf the political intent of the reference to Clay’s committee had been in\r\nthe least open to doubt, all such was removed by the action of the\r\nSenate in thereupon ordering the matter referred to the Committee on\r\nPublic Lands. Again Clay vehemently protested. He had not wanted to\r\nreport upon the subject. He had protested against the reference. But the\r\nreference having been made, and the report submitted, he protested anew\r\nagainst the reflection upon his committee implied by the new reference.\r\n\r\nAt the head of the Committee on Public Lands was Senator King of\r\nAlabama, but Clay was right in ascribing the authorship of the report,\r\nsoon to be submitted, to Thomas H. Benton.[415] This report vigorously\r\nassailed the reasoning and conclusions of Clay; attacked the disposition\r\nto look upon the public lands as useful primarily for revenue and\r\nsecondarily for settlement, and reversed the order; and deprecated the\r\nsuggestion of the use of the money to be distributed among the States\r\nfor the colonization of the negroes as calculated to “light up the fires\r\nof the extinguished conflagration which lately blazed on the Missouri\r\nquestion.” It favored the reduction of the price of land to one dollar\r\nper acre during the next five years; then to fifty cents, with fifteen\r\nper cent of the proceeds to be apportioned among the States. Whatever\r\nmay have been the objections to the Democratic plan, it gave promise of\r\nan earlier redemption of the wilderness by the cultivation of man, and\r\nthe more speedy enhancement of the land of the pioneers already in\r\npossession.\r\n\r\nKeenly appreciative of the purpose of his enemies, Clay delivered a long\r\nand powerful speech, his second campaign speech in the Senate, plausibly\r\ndefending his position, explaining Rush’s meaning, and attempting to\r\ndivert the greed of the new States into a different channel. That he\r\nmade a profound impression may be properly assumed from the fact that\r\nthe bill passed the Senate, although it was checked by a hostile House.\r\n\r\nThus his friends flattered themselves that he had scored a triumph and\r\noutwitted his foes. The old school politicians still gauged public\r\nopinion by the roll-calls of the Congress. The new school, which came in\r\nwith Jackson, were least of all concerned with the views of the\r\npoliticians at the capital. They were interesting themselves with the\r\nplain voters, and were devising means for reaching these in the campaign\r\nto follow. They had sensed the feelings and the prejudices and\r\nsuspicions of the pioneers of the new States. They were an agricultural\r\npeople and easily inflamed by the suggestion that their interests were\r\nto be subordinated or sacrificed to the interests of the Eastern\r\nindustrial centers. They wanted the speedy felling of the forests, the\r\ncultivation of the fields, the building of homes and schools and\r\nchurches, and the Benton plan of reduced prices and preemption for\r\nactual settlers appealed to them as in harmony with their desires.\r\n\r\nAnd thus, while the friends of Clay were rejoicing in what they\r\nconceived to be the unanswerable logic of the Clay report, the\r\npoliticians of the Kitchen Cabinet, Kendall and Blair, were rejoicing in\r\nhaving, in documentary form, the proof that Clay and the protectionists\r\nwere hostile to the wishes of the new States. Amos Kendall knew that\r\n“free trade and free lands” was a shibboleth that these pioneers could\r\nunderstand. And while Clay, Webster, and Clayton were rejoicing over the\r\npassage of the bill in the Senate, Kendall and Blair were joyously\r\narranging to spread the story of that triumph to the voters of the new\r\nStates. After all, they had succeeded in their purpose. They had a Clay\r\nand a Jackson report to hold side by side, and the event disclosed that\r\nthe politicians of the Kitchen Cabinet were wiser than the politicians\r\nof the Senate house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nCLAY FINDS HIS ISSUE\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nDuring the early days of the Jackson régime, a remarkable and little\r\nremembered figure passed furtively in and out of the closet of the\r\nPresident, playing a quiet, but none the less effective, part in the\r\nmoulding of policies. This was none other than James A. Hamilton, son of\r\nthe creator of the National Bank. Then a trusted brave of the tribe of\r\nTammany, the reflector of Van Buren, the supporter of Jackson, he had\r\nfought the Federalist machine of New York, been made acting Secretary of\r\nState by the President pending the arrival of Van Buren, and later been\r\nappointed District Attorney of New York. For several years on the eve of\r\nportentous events he glided into the capital. That the son of Alexander\r\nHamilton should have had such intimate relations with the President who\r\ndenounced what he thought to be the persecution of Aaron Burr, is one of\r\nthe mysteries of history.\r\n\r\nWhen the first Jackson Message was under consideration, Hamilton, in\r\nresponse to the requests of Van Buren, Lewis, and others, reached\r\nWashington to confer with Jackson. He hastened to Van Buren, who was no\r\ndoubt prolific of suggestions; thence to the White House to be cordially\r\nreceived. The following morning he breakfasted with the President, who\r\nurged him to remain at the White House while revising the Message. In\r\ngoing over the draft, which he found the “work of different hands,” he\r\nwas surprised to find that “the Bank of the United States was attacked\r\nat great length in a loose, newspaper slashing style.” He found much to\r\ndo. It was four o’clock in the morning when Jackson, hearing some one\r\ntinkering with the fire in the grate, entered Hamilton’s room in his\r\nnightgown.\r\n\r\n“My dear Colonel, why are you up so late?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“I am at my work which I intend to finish before I sleep,” Hamilton\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\nAt which the mulatto who slept on a rug in Jackson’s room was sent in to\r\nkeep Hamilton’s fire going. At eight in the morning the latter appeared\r\nin the President’s room to report the completion of his task.\r\n\r\n“What did you say about the Bank?” Jackson asked instantly.\r\n\r\n“Very little.”\r\n\r\nAnd the son of Alexander Hamilton read the brief paragraph challenging\r\nthe constitutionality and the expediency of the Bank his father had\r\ncreated, and declaring that it had “failed in the great end of\r\nestablishing a uniform and sound currency.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think that is all I ought to say?” asked Jackson.\r\n\r\n“I think you ought to say nothing about the Bank at present,” was the\r\nresponse.\r\n\r\n“Oh, but, my friend, I am pledged against the Bank, but if you think\r\nthat is enough, so let it be.”[416]\r\n\r\nSome students of the period are prone to ascribe Jackson’s hostility to\r\nthe Bank to a personal grievance of Isaac Hill. The flimsy assumption\r\nthat the President’s Bank policy was born of the quarrel of the Concord\r\neditor with Biddle, because of the retention in the presidency of the\r\nPortsmouth branch of Jeremiah Mason, is unimpressive. Equally absurd to\r\ndeny that the Mason incident played no part. According to some, Hill, in\r\nhis attempt to force the removal of Mason, was wholly actuated by a\r\ndesire to get political control of the institution; to others, to the\r\ninability of the editor-politician to get a loan. The truth is that the\r\nhostility to Mason was not confined to politicians, but was shared by\r\nmany of the merchants of New Hampshire. This hostility was due to\r\nMason’s austere action, on discovering that some bad loans had been made\r\non speculative ventures, in exacting hard terms of the local merchants.\r\nThe petition sent to Biddle by Hill contained the names of sixty members\r\nof the legislature, and most of the business men of Portsmouth, of both\r\nparties.[417] The president of the Portsmouth branch was a great lawyer,\r\na statesman of reputation, an orator of power, and a partisan as bitter\r\nand intolerant as ever breathed the proscriptive air of New Hampshire.\r\nIn the correspondence which followed between Secretary Ingham, who is\r\nsaid to have had a personal grievance,[418] and Nicholas Biddle, the\r\npresident of the Bank, who has been variously described according to the\r\nbias of the writer, was unquestionably flippant and intolerant of\r\nsuggestions from the Administration. While his position in the Mason\r\nincident can be justified, he was unnecessarily arrogant and tactless;\r\nbut quickly realizing his mistake, he thereafter changed his tone, and\r\nthroughout the summer and autumn of 1829 made every effort to conciliate\r\nthe President. His letters of this period to the heads of the various\r\nbranches insisting that the Bank be kept out of politics smack of\r\nsincerity.[419] But the harm had been done, and there is every reason to\r\nconclude that Amos Kendall was deeply concerned in the President’s\r\ndecision to attack the Bank in his first Message. Certain it is that a\r\nletter from Kendall to Noah in November led the “New York Courier and\r\nEnquirer” to launch its editorial campaign against the institution. This\r\nletter, announcing the presidential decision to attack in his first\r\nMessage, and presenting an argument in support of the position he was to\r\nassume, was sent by Noah to the newspaper, and “a portion of Amos\r\nKendall’s letter, with a head and tail put to it ... was published as an\r\neditorial the next morning”; and this “was the first savage attack on\r\nthe United States Bank” in the columns of that paper.[420] And almost\r\nimmediately afterwards James Gordon Bennett, writing for the “Courier\r\nand Enquirer,” began a series of powerful articles in support of the\r\npolicy of that journal.[421]\r\n\r\nIndeed, if an explanation for Jackson’s position must be sought in the\r\nKitchen Cabinet, it would be more profitable to seek it in the\r\nprinciples of Amos Kendall, who had written against the Bank long before\r\nhe had met the President, and while still on friendly terms with Clay.\r\nOthers of Jackson’s intimates were equally hostile. The views of Benton\r\nhad been urged for years; and Hugh L. White, Senator from Tennessee, one\r\nof his confidential advisers in the early days of his Administration,\r\nhad long distrusted the institution as tending to extravagant\r\nspeculation, and as threatening the liberties of the people through its\r\nincreasing influence in elections.[422] But Jackson himself needed no\r\npropagandists at his elbow. He had been prejudiced against the Bank for\r\ntwenty years by Clay’s slashing speech against it when the first Bank\r\napplied for a recharter.[423]\r\n\r\nIn his Message of December, 1830, Jackson dismissed the Bank in a\r\nparagraph, clearly indicative of unfriendliness; and in December, 1831,\r\nhe scarcely mentioned it at all, except to call attention to his\r\nprevious statements. But from the moment the first Message was read,\r\nBiddle’s complacency was disturbed. His correspondence during the next\r\ntwo years shows him active and alert in attempts to conciliate his foe\r\nin the White House. Less than a week after one son of Alexander Hamilton\r\nhad penned the first warning of war, Biddle was reading a letter from\r\nAlexander Hamilton, Jr., a brother, assuring him that the die was cast,\r\nthe war inevitable, and warning him against the presidential\r\naspirations of Van Buren, to whose political fortunes his brother was\r\nthen attached.[424] Biddle replied that the Bank views of the Message\r\nwere Jackson’s, honestly held, and that for the time the Bank’s policy\r\nwould be one of “abstinence and self-defense.”[425] “The expressions of\r\nthe Message were the President’s own,” he wrote the head of the\r\nWashington branch immediately afterward, “ ... and inserted in\r\nopposition to the wishes, if not the advice of all his habitual\r\ncounsellors. It is not, therefore, a cabinet measure, nor a party\r\nmeasure, but a personal measure.”[426] And had he not ample\r\nencouragement in the letters of Major Lewis, a household guest of\r\nJackson’s, recommending the appointment of certain men to the\r\ndirectorship of the branch in Nashville?[427] Nevertheless, he was not\r\nat all positive that the recharter might not be made a party measure.\r\nEspecially concerned with Van Buren’s attitude, he was being constantly\r\nwarned against him, but his advices were contradictory. Within a month\r\nhe was reassured by one correspondent[428] and alarmed by Clay, who\r\nwrote him from Ashland that, while in Richmond, Van Buren had entered\r\ninto a conspiracy with politicians to destroy the Bank.[429] And to add\r\nto the mystic maze of contradictions, Major Lewis wrote, in a\r\n“confidential” note, that the report that Jackson would veto a bill\r\nrechartering the Bank “must be some mistake because the report was at\r\nvariance with what I had heard him say upon the subject.”[430] Still\r\nanother correspondent[431] informed him that Van Buren had told him that\r\n“he disapproved of that part of the message and was not hostile to the\r\nBank.”\r\n\r\nAbout this time Jackson journeyed to the Hermitage, and Biddle asked a\r\nleading citizen of Nashville to “feel him out.” The banker’s\r\ncorrespondent entertained the President at his home, and after a\r\nconfidential chat felt justified in advising Biddle that he was “well\r\nconvinced that he will not interfere with Congress on the subject of the\r\nrenewing of the charter.”[432] By this time, however, Biddle had\r\nconvinced himself that political expediency would determine the\r\nPresident’s attitude, and in a letter to one of Jackson’s personal\r\nfriends he pointed out the disastrous political results to the\r\nAdministration if the impression gained ground that it was “unfriendly\r\nto sound currency.” He even graciously indicated the line the next\r\nMessage might take to save the Administration from that\r\nembarrassment.[433] But before that suggestion reached its destination,\r\nClay solemnly wrote him that only a devoted friend of the Bank in the\r\nPresidency would make a recharter possible, and warned him against Van\r\nBuren. He was convinced that the Jacksonian politicians had determined\r\nto make the Bank question the issue in the next campaign. “I have seen\r\nmany evidences of it,” he wrote. “The editors of certain papers have\r\nreceived their orders to that effect, and embrace every occasion to act\r\nin conformity with them.”[434] But when Congress met in December, and\r\nJackson reiterated his views on the Bank, Biddle was earnestly urged\r\nfrom Washington to meet the issue at once by applying for a new charter.\r\nThis advice was finally rejected. Congress, he wrote, was favorable,\r\n“and moreover the President would not reject the bill,” but many members\r\nfavorable to the recharter would prefer not to vote that session. Then,\r\ntoo, time was working the removal of prejudices.[435]\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the session, December, 1831, with the charter five\r\nyears to run, we are confronted with the mystery of the injection of\r\nthe issue at that time. We know, however, that the strain of uncertainty\r\nhad been telling on Biddle’s temper. The vultures that play on the\r\npolitical necessities of corporations were beginning to swoop down upon\r\nhim. Duff Green, of the “National Telegraph,” had applied for a $20,000\r\nloan.[436] And mindful of the importance of propaganda, he had already\r\ndecided to cultivate the press by paying it well for the publication of\r\nBank literature.[437] But just before the opening of the congressional\r\nsession, his negotiations with McLane and Livingston of the Cabinet,\r\nboth friendly to the Bank, had again diverted him from his disposition\r\nto fight. In October the Secretary of the Treasury had sat in the\r\nmarble-front building in Philadelphia and told him of confidential\r\ncommunications with the President. Anxious to keep the Bank question out\r\nof the campaign, Jackson had reluctantly consented, on the importunities\r\nof Livingston and McLane, to omit all references to the Bank in his\r\nMessage. Biddle feared it would be a mistake. Would it not be better\r\nmerely to remind Congress of his previous comments, and leave the\r\ndecision “with the representatives of the people?” The fact that this\r\ncourse was followed is one of the ironies of history.[438] Hardly had\r\nthis decision been reached when Clay wrote from Ashland urging an\r\nimmediate application for a new charter. This was a sensational reversal\r\nof views. Not only had he previously advised Biddle differently, but in\r\nAugust, 1830, he had taken strong grounds against such application so\r\nlong before the expiration of the existing charter. “I am not prepared,”\r\nhe said then, “to say whether the charter ought, or ought not to be\r\nrenewed on the expiration of its present term. The question is\r\npremature. I may not be alive to form any opinion on it. It belongs to\r\nposterity. It ought to be indefinitely postponed.”[439] This speech was\r\nto be used with deadly effect by Blair in the “Globe” a little\r\nlater.[440] Even then, before reaching Washington, Clay had determined\r\nto “turn up” the Bank charter as an issue.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nWhen Congress met, Jackson had concluded to postpone his fight on the\r\nBank. Three reasons entered into the decision--the friendliness of his\r\nSecretary of the Treasury to the institution, the realization that a\r\nmajority in Congress favored the recharter, and the fear that a contest\r\nduring the session would throw the tremendous weight of the Bank’s\r\ninfluence against him in the election. Most of his advisers, including\r\nBenton, were anxious to postpone the contest. Just as Biddle had thought\r\nthat time would operate to the advantage of the institution, Benton was\r\nconfident that it would work to its detriment, and he wished to\r\nstrengthen the anti-Bank lines in the Senate and to have Van Buren in\r\nthe chair when the contest came. McLane’s pronouncedly pro-Bank report\r\nhad deeply embarrassed the President’s supporters. Creating indignation\r\nin some quarters, consternation in others, Jackson hastened to explain\r\nit away in a letter to Hamilton; but just how he persuaded himself that\r\nthe views of the report did “not express any opposition to those\r\nentertained by myself,” is not clear.[441]\r\n\r\nThe Bank supporters had eagerly seized upon the McLane report, and Webb,\r\nof the “New York Courier and Enquirer,” now deserting the Administration\r\non the Bank question, commented glowingly upon its author and his views.\r\nThat this was gall and wormwood to Jackson and his intimates is evident\r\nin the correspondence which passed between them. “The article ... was\r\ncalculated if Blair had replied, to do McLane irreparable injury in a\r\npolitical point of view, because it might have brought him and the\r\nPresident into seeming collision,” wrote Major Lewis to Hamilton.[442]\r\nAnd all this time, McLane, who was one of Hamilton’s correspondents, was\r\nfrankly admitting to the latter that he had “most earnestly urged Mr.\r\nClay not to attempt to pass a Bank bill at this session, insisting that,\r\nif deferred to the next session, he was satisfied that he could, by that\r\ntime, induce Jackson to approve it”; but that Clay had “persisted in the\r\nhope, that if the President approved the bill, he would lose the support\r\nof those of his party who had approved his opposition to the Bank, and a\r\nvast many others who approved of the State Bank system.” Or, on the\r\nother hand, “if the President vetoed the bill, he would lose\r\nPennsylvania and his election.”[443] Thus it is clear enough, that if\r\nJackson could have determined, the Bank would not have been an issue in\r\n1832.\r\n\r\nBut Clay was pressing Biddle, and the latter devoted the whole of\r\nDecember to feeling his way. “I think they [the Jackson leaders] are\r\ndesirous to have the Bank question settled by a renewal before the next\r\npresidential canvass, with any modifications to free the President from\r\nthe charge of an entire abandonment of his original opposition,” wrote\r\none who had “seen a letter from the Private Secretary of the President\r\nto a gentleman” in Louisville.[444] “Last night I had a long\r\nconversation with McLane,” wrote the president of the Washington branch,\r\n“and I am authorized by him to say that it is his deliberate opinion and\r\nadvice that a renewal of the charter ought not to be pressed during the\r\npresent session, in which I concur most sincerely. The message is as\r\nmuch as you could expect. It shows that the Chief is wavering. If\r\npressed into a corner immediately, neither McLane nor myself will answer\r\nfor the consequences.”[445] From another correspondent Biddle learned\r\nthat Barry, Woodbury, and Taney were hostile, being “under the influence\r\nof Blair, Lewis, Kendall & Co. who rule our Chief Magistrate”; that\r\nBlair had written a slashing attack upon the McLane report, which was\r\nonly moderated after the Secretary of the Treasury had threatened to\r\nresign if the original were published. “I fear you will yet have trouble\r\nwith our wise governors,” he added.[446] A Virginia Congressman urged\r\nreasons for an immediate application. Jackson’s popularity was on the\r\nwane, especially in Congress, and his reëlection notwithstanding being\r\ncertain, he would have more prestige in the next Congress. Calhoun,\r\nstill Vice-President, would be serviceable among the Bank’s enemies in\r\nthe South, and McDuffie, a follower of Calhoun, would be chairman of the\r\nHouse Committee to pass upon the application.[447]\r\n\r\n“My own belief,” wrote the wily Clay, “is that, if now called upon, he\r\n[Jackson] would not negative the bill, but that if he should be\r\nreëlected, the event might and probably would be different.” At any\r\nrate, all the friends of the Bank with whom Clay had conversed “expect\r\nthe application to be made.”[448] In corroboration of Clay’s views,\r\nWebster wrote that, as a result of conversations, he had been strongly\r\nconfirmed in his opinion “that it is expedient for the Bank to apply for\r\na renewal of the Charter without delay.”[449]\r\n\r\nConfused by such a medley of counsel, Biddle decided to have the\r\nsituation studied on the ground. Thomas Cadwalader, a trusted Bank\r\nagent, could be depended upon to leave party considerations out of his\r\nsurvey, and on Tuesday, the 20th of December, this servitor took up his\r\nquarters at Barnard’s Hotel.[450] The next day found him closeted, first\r\nwith McLane, who warned him of a certain veto, and advised him to\r\ncanvass Congress to ascertain whether the Bank could muster the two\r\nthirds necessary to override it. A preliminary survey that day was\r\ndiscouraging, and the evening found the agent again with McLane, who\r\nreiterated his plea for a postponement until after the election. On\r\nThursday the agent met McDuffie, who urged an immediate application\r\nuntil “staggered” by what Cadwalader had learned of the probable vote to\r\noverride the veto. He then advised the Bank to feel its way cautiously.\r\nFriday found him dining with Senator Smith, a Democrat, who opposed the\r\nagitation of the question that session, since it would mean a Jackson\r\nand anti-Jackson vote, and lose the Bank ten votes it could depend upon\r\nthe next year.[451] It did not take the sagacious agent long to sense\r\nthe selfish political motives of the Clay leaders. “It is evident,” he\r\nwrote Biddle, “that W.’s [Webster’s] opinions are guided, in some\r\ndegree, by party feelings--as seems to be the case with most of the Clay\r\nmen.” In John Quincy Adams he found a cooler head, and one in whose\r\njudgment he had more confidence. Where Webster had urged that the\r\napplication be made if “a bare majority in Congress could be mustered,”\r\nAdams favored postponement “unless a strong vote can be ascertained.”\r\nBut, thinking the situation over on Christmas Day, and after another and\r\nmore favorable canvass of the available votes, he began to lean toward\r\nthe Clay opinion. In the case of a postponement some of the Bank’s\r\nfriends would be “luke-warm,” Webster would be “cold or perhaps\r\nhostile,” if the Bank bent to the Government influence. After another\r\nconference with McLane, he thought he would advise the Bank to start the\r\nmemorial. In this disposition he was confirmed by a visit on Christmas\r\nnight from the brother of the Secretary of State, a Whig and a follower\r\nof Clay, who brought the solemn assurance that Livingston, McLane, and\r\nCass would prevent the veto. The outcome of it all was that Cadwalader\r\nwas won over to the Whig plan.[452] The moment the agent returned to\r\nPhiladelphia, McLane, assuming the chilly dignity of resentment, wrote\r\nBiddle, restating his position and curtly declaring that he could not,\r\n“as one of the constitutional advisers of the President,” object to the\r\nexercise of his veto power.[453] But three days later, Webster, in a\r\nreassuring note, wrote that the decision to present the memorial was\r\n“exactly right.”[454]\r\n\r\nThe Whig politicians were determined that the Bank should be dragged\r\ninto politics, and they had their way. The desire of Biddle to accept\r\ncompromises proposed by McLane were ruthlessly brushed aside by his\r\npolitical friends. The story of the meeting at which Clay forced the\r\nissue is significant and dramatic. McLane had summoned Biddle to\r\nWashington and submitted a proposition for a recharter which, he\r\ncontended, would meet with the approval of the President. After\r\nreturning to Philadelphia and consulting with his directors, an\r\nagreement was reached to accept the compromise. Hurrying back to the\r\ncapital, Biddle conceived the unhappy notion of first consulting with\r\nthe political friends of the institution in the Congress, before calling\r\nupon McLane. Fatal error!\r\n\r\nAn historical political conference was called. There, of course, was\r\nNicholas Biddle, financial American autocrat of his time, elegant,\r\nsuave, polished to scintillation, a lover of literature, a brilliant\r\nconversationalist, with a graceful epistolary style, which was as\r\ndangerous to him as loquacity to a diplomat. He had been schooled in\r\ntact while serving as the Secretary of the American Legation at Paris\r\nunder Monroe. Clever, unscrupulous, practicing diplomacy where\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _N. Biddle_]\r\n\r\nstraightforward methods would have served better, he had assiduously\r\ncultivated public men until he had created a bipartisan Bank party in\r\nboth branches of the Congress. In his Philadelphia home the great men of\r\nhis day partook of his hospitality. Before Jackson reached the\r\nPresidency, the president of the Bank of the United States was in better\r\nposition to foresee the proceedings of Congress than the responsible\r\nChief Executive of the people. Instead of concealing his power, he loved\r\nto flaunt it in the face of authority. “Emperor Nicholas” smiled and\r\nbowed blandly to his title.\r\n\r\nAnd there, of course, was Clay, leader of his party, the greatest genius\r\nin the Senate, seemingly destined to the presidential dignity, and for\r\nyears one of Biddle’s most trusted friends and advisers. He had been on\r\nthe pay-roll of the Bank as its counsel in Kentucky and Ohio.\r\n\r\nThere, too, was John Sergeant, there by right as chief counsel of the\r\nBank, but there, too, by right, as Clay’s running mate in the election,\r\nfor he had been nominated for Vice-President.\r\n\r\nAnd there sat Webster, upon whose eloquence and wisdom the Bank had\r\nlearned to lean. But he sat there that day, less as the champion of the\r\nBank than as a partisan supporter of Clay and Sergeant.\r\n\r\nThe compromise proposition was submitted by Biddle, and, after some\r\npretense at discussion, it was vetoed by Clay and Webster, on the ground\r\nthat “the question of a recharter had progressed too far to render any\r\ncompromise or change of front expedient.”[455]\r\n\r\nA little nonplussed, Biddle and Sergeant retired for further\r\nconsideration, and returned to the conference with the politicians in\r\nthe evening still convinced that the McLane compromise should be\r\naccepted. And it was then that Clay and Webster, by assuming an injured\r\nair, literally blackmailed their Philadelphia friends into the\r\nacceptance of their plan, asserting their ability at the time to carry\r\nthe charter through in the face of a veto, but significantly adding that\r\nthey would no longer be responsible for anything that might occur “if in\r\nthe heat of the contest the Bank, abandoning its reliable friends,\r\nshould strike hands with its foe.”[456] Thus it was neither Jackson nor\r\nBiddle that forced the Bank into the campaign of 1832, but Henry Clay,\r\nthinking solely in terms of politics and self-interest, as he saw them.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThe winter roads between Philadelphia and Washington were ribbons of\r\nmud, cut across by frozen streams. A stagecoach, bumping and splattering\r\nthrough the mire, struck an obstruction, turned over, and General\r\nCadwalader, with the Bank’s memorial in his pocket, arose from the wreck\r\nwith an injured shoulder that was to delay its presentation to the\r\nCongress. But three weeks after the conference in Washington it was\r\ndelivered into the hands of its friends.\r\n\r\nIn the Senate it was presented by a Democrat, George M. Dallas of\r\nPennsylvania, acting under strict instructions from the Legislature of\r\nhis State, but very much against his personal judgment. In the House it\r\nwas entrusted to one who could act with greater spirit, because of\r\nvenomous hostility to Jackson--the vehement and picturesque McDuffie.\r\n\r\nOn the motion of Dallas, a select committee was chosen in the Senate to\r\nconsider the memorial, composed of four friends of the Bank and one\r\nenemy. In the House, the fighting began at once. Instead of requesting a\r\nselect committee, McDuffie asked a reference to his own Committee on\r\nWays and Means--packed with friends of the Bank. This was good tactics.\r\nAndrew Stevenson, Speaker of the House, and a Jacksonian Democrat, could\r\nclearly not be entrusted with the selection of a special committee. An\r\nanimated debate followed, and the McDuffie motion prevailed by a narrow\r\nmargin of ten votes. But that was not to be the end of the matter--not\r\nso long as there was a Jackson in the White House, a Benton in the\r\nSenate, and a Kendall on the side lines. The plan of parliamentary\r\nwarfare was devised by the master parliamentarian from Missouri. It\r\ncontemplated numerous amendments and elaborate discussion in the Senate;\r\nand in the House, an investigation into the condition and methods of the\r\nBank. Benton immediately furnished a new member of the House, Clayton,\r\nwith an indictment in many counts, some justifiable, and others having\r\nnothing more substantial than gossip behind them. But even these served.\r\nThe debate was brisk. James K. Polk led for the Administration in the\r\nstrongest speech of his congressional career; and McDuffie, sincerely\r\nbelieving in the purity of the Bank, and fearing the effect of\r\nopposition to an investigation, making only a perfunctory objection. At\r\nthe time it was presented, Biddle was relying for information on Charles\r\nJared Ingersoll, who had been sent to Washington in an attempt to\r\nconciliate Jackson, and was in constant communication with Livingston\r\nand McLane. It is significant of Jackson’s methods that his Secretary of\r\nState authorized Ingersoll to inform Biddle that the President had\r\nnothing to do with the resolution, wished to end the matter that\r\nsession, and would sign a rechartering measure if satisfactorily\r\nframed.[457] But the easy capitulation of McDuffie in permitting the\r\npassage of the resolution caused poignant distress in Bank circles.\r\nIngersoll concluded that the Carolinian preferred to have the tariff\r\ndebate precede that on the Bank.[458]\r\n\r\nThus the investigation was ordered. The apologists for the Bank among\r\nhistorians persist in the fallacy that its enemies had no expectation of\r\nfinding anything wrong. This is a remarkable conclusion. Benton\r\nthoroughly expected it. The son of Alexander Hamilton had no doubt of\r\nit.[459] Jackson was serious about it. “The affairs of the Bank I\r\nanticipated to be precisely such as you have intimated,” he wrote to\r\nHamilton. “When fully disclosed, and the branches looked into it will be\r\nseen that its corrupting influence has been extended everywhere that\r\ncould add to its strength and secure its recharter. I wish it may not\r\nhave extended its influence over too many members of Congress.”[460]\r\n\r\nThe committee of investigation submitted three reports. The majority\r\nreport charged usury, the issuance of branch bank notes as currency, the\r\nselling of coin, loans to editors, brokers, and members of Congress,\r\ndonations to roads and canals, the construction of houses to rent and\r\nsell, and the sale of stock obtained from the Government through special\r\nacts of Congress. The minority report, and that of Adams, who reported\r\nseparately, were laudatory of the institution. Nothing was proved.\r\nCampaign material was furnished, and nothing more.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the fighting, on May 30th, Nicholas Biddle moved upon\r\nthe capital and took personal charge of his forces. He entertained at\r\ndinners at Barnard’s. He daily repaired to the Capitol to meet\r\nemergencies. He conferred freely with Livingston and McLane, hoping\r\nthrough them to conciliate the President. So positive was he that the\r\ninvestigation, by proving nothing, had disarmed hostility, that he wrote\r\nexpansively, on his arrival, of his willingness to consider with Jackson\r\nsuch modifications as would satisfy the President.[461] In less than a\r\nweek he was disillusioned of the idea of an easy triumph. “It has been a\r\nweek of hard work, anxiety and alternating hopes and fears,” he wrote\r\nCadwalader, “but I think that we may now rely with confidence in a\r\nfavorable result.”[462] All through June the battle raged in the Senate,\r\nand it was not until July 3d that the “Emperor Nicholas” was able to\r\nwrite of the passage of the bill by that body, and to “congratulate our\r\nfriends most cordially upon their most satisfactory results.” The\r\nvictory was achieved by a vote of 28 to 20, with Dallas, Wilkins, and\r\nPoindexter, among the Democrats, voting for the bill. In the House, the\r\nBank won by a vote of 106 to 84.\r\n\r\n“Now for the President,” wrote Biddle. “My belief is that the President\r\nwill veto the bill, though that is not generally known or\r\nbelieved.”[463] And Clay at the same time wrote: “The Bank bill will, I\r\nbelieve, pass the House, and if Jackson is to be believed, he will veto\r\nit.”[464] Thus, at this stage, it is evident that Biddle had reconciled\r\nhimself to Clay’s plan of making the fate of the Bank the issue in the\r\ncampaign. Among Jackson’s friends there was no doubt as to his\r\nintentions. Both McLane and Livingston had warned the banker. Three\r\nmonths before, Hamilton had written a friend that, in the event of its\r\npassage, Jackson would promptly veto the measure. “He is open and\r\ndetermined upon this point. I conferred with him yesterday upon the\r\nsubject. I told him what the Opposition avowed as their motive for\r\npushing the bill at this session. He replied: ‘I will prove to them that\r\nI never flinch; that they were mistaken when they expected to act upon\r\nme with such considerations.’”[465]\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nWhen the bill reached Jackson, he knew that he could not count on the\r\nunanimous support of his Cabinet on the veto. Livingston, McLane, and\r\nCass were frankly antagonistic to his purpose, Woodbury was uncertain,\r\nwhile Barry, always acquiescing in his chief’s policies, scarcely\r\ncounted. Among all the men who sat about the table in the Cabinet room,\r\nthe only one who heartily sympathized with his intent was Roger Taney.\r\nIn February, Ingersoll had found him against the Bank, but Livingston\r\nthen “hoped to convert him”; and while the Bank representative had\r\n“found him just now closeted with Kendall,” this was so far from\r\ndiscouraging him that he had not even despaired of Kendall and Lewis,\r\nand felt that he had established “a good understanding” with Blair of\r\nthe “Globe.”[466] On the day the bill reached the White House, Taney was\r\nabsent from Washington, but he had gone over the ground thoroughly with\r\nthe President, and had written him a letter setting forth reasons why,\r\nin the event of the bill’s passage, it should be vetoed.\r\n\r\nOn the day of its passage, Martin Van Buren landed in New York, and the\r\nfollowing morning he started for the capital. It was midnight when he\r\nreached Washington, but, in compliance with a letter from Jackson, which\r\nawaited him on landing, he proceeded through the dark streets to the\r\nWhite House where he was instantly ushered into the President’s room.\r\nThe grim old fighter was sitting up in bed, supported by pillows, his\r\nwretched health clearly denoted in his countenance.[467] But there was\r\nthe passion of battle in his blood, and it flashed in his eye as he\r\neagerly grasped the hand of his favorite, and, retaining it, poured\r\nforth the story of the Bank Bill, and expressed his satisfaction on the\r\narrival of a faithful friend at such a critical juncture. When Van Buren\r\nexpressed the hope that he would not hesitate to veto the bill,\r\nJackson’s face beamed. “It is the only way,” said the Red Fox, “you can\r\ndischarge the great duty you owe to the country and yourself.”[468] By\r\nVan Buren, the old man’s gratification was easily understood, for he\r\nknew of the desertion of the greater part of the Cabinet.\r\n\r\nThere is some confusion among those who should have known as to the\r\nauthorship of the Veto Message. In this instance Hamilton was not called\r\nin, albeit sympathizing heartily with Jackson’s purpose. According to\r\none of his biographers[469] the ideas were contributed by Livingston,\r\nBenton, Taney, and Jackson, and the phrasing was by Amos Kendall, Blair,\r\nand Lewis. In view of Livingston’s negotiations with Biddle, we may\r\nsafely accept his denial of having had any part in the Message. It was\r\ninevitable that Benton should have been consulted. And it is known that\r\nTaney was summoned back to Washington to assist in the framing. During\r\nthe entire time it was being written, Van Buren, who remained at the\r\ncapital, with the document open to his inspection, did not have any\r\n“direct agency in its construction.”[470] His enemies at the time,\r\nhowever, insisted that he was a party to the phrasing. “Mr. Van Buren\r\narrived at the President’s on Sunday,” a correspondent in Washington\r\nwrote Biddle, “and to-day the President sent to the Senate his veto on\r\nthe Bank Bill.”[471] That Major Lewis and Blair were called in to assist\r\nin the actual wording is quite probable, but it may be set down as\r\npositive that the greater part of the document as it reached the Senate\r\nwas the product of the pen of the mysterious recluse, Amos Kendall.\r\n\r\nThat such a Message from such a pen at such a time should be strikingly\r\nstrong and couched in such language as to appeal to the electorate of\r\nthe Nation was inevitable. It has been fashionable to describe it as\r\ndemagogic because of its appeal to the masses and its protest against\r\nthe conversion by the rich of governmental agencies to their personal\r\nends, and because of its objections to the foreign stockholders in the\r\nBank of the United States. It was, of course, a campaign\r\ndocument--intended as such. Jackson understood perfectly that the\r\npresentation of the memorial for a recharter four years before the\r\nexpiration of the existing charter, and in the year of the presidential\r\nelection, was a campaign move on the part of Clay. He knew that Clay was\r\nappealing to wealth and power--he appealed to the people. And his\r\nappeal was to the people of the United States.\r\n\r\nIn this stirring appeal to the prejudices of the people, as well as to\r\ntheir interests, as the Jacksonians saw it, there was but one real\r\nblunder, and that in phrasing. In discussing the constitutionality of\r\nthe Bank, Jackson said: “Each officer who takes an oath to support the\r\nConstitution, swears that he will support it as he understands it, and\r\nnot as it is understood by others.” Upon this was to be predicated the\r\nassertion that Jackson had announced a philosophy of chaos, with each\r\npetty officer passing upon the constitutionality of laws, and\r\nirrespective and in contempt of the Supreme Court. The more conservative\r\nfriends of the President interpreted the words employed as meaning “that\r\nin giving or withholding his assent to the bill for the recharter of the\r\nBank, it was his right and duty to decide the question of its\r\nconstitutionality for himself, uninfluenced by any opinion or judgment\r\nwhich the Supreme Court had pronounced upon that point, farther than his\r\njudgment was satisfied by the reasons it had given for its\r\ndecision.”[472] But there were other expressions in the Message that\r\nmust have appeared as little short of appeals to anarchy to the more\r\nconservative element. “It is to be regretted that the rich and powerful\r\ntoo often bend the acts of Government to their selfish purposes.” “Every\r\nman is equally entitled to protection by law; but when the laws\r\nundertake to add to these natural and just advantages artificial\r\ndistinctions, to grant titles, gratuities, and exclusive privileges, to\r\nmake the rich richer and the powerful more potent, the humble members of\r\nsociety--the farmers, mechanics and laborers--who have neither the time\r\nnor the means of securing like favors to themselves, have a right to\r\ncomplain of the injustice of their government.” “There are no necessary\r\nevils in government. Its evils exist only in its abuses.” “Many of our\r\nrich have not been content with equal protection and equal benefits,\r\nbut have besought us to make them richer by act of Congress.”\r\n\r\nHere was a Message striking an entirely new note in American politics,\r\nand not without justification. So completely had the country been under\r\nthe domination of the powerful, politically, financially, and socially,\r\nprevious to the Jackson régime, that the Message was actually hailed\r\nwith delight by the followers of Clay.\r\n\r\n“As to the veto message,” wrote Biddle, “I am delighted with it. It has\r\nall the fury of the unchained panther, biting the bars of his cage. It\r\nis really a manifesto of anarchy, such as Marat and Robespierre might\r\nhave issued to the mob of the Faubourg St. Antoine; and my hope is that\r\nit will contribute to relieve the country from the domination of these\r\nmiserable people.”[473] The personal organ of Clay, the “Lexington\r\nObserver,” commented thus: “It is a mixture of the Demagogue and the\r\nDespot, of depravity, desperation and feelings of malice and vengeance\r\npartially smothered. It is the type of the detested hypocrite, who,\r\ncornered at all points, still cannot abandon entirely his habitual\r\nartifice, but at length, finding himself stripped naked, in a tone of\r\ndefiance says: ‘I am a villain; now do your worst and so will I.’”[474]\r\nSo little did the Bank and its supporters understand the psychology of\r\nthe “mob” that it published and circulated thirty thousand copies of the\r\nMessage at its own expense!\r\n\r\nBut if the Whigs were pleased with its tone, the Democrats were\r\ndelighted. Either Blair or Kendall in a fulsome editorial in the “Globe”\r\nfound it “difficult to describe in adequate language the sublimity of\r\nthe moral spectacle now presented to the American people in the person\r\nof Andrew Jackson,” and that “in this act the glories of the\r\nbattle-field are eclipsed--it is the crowning chaplet of an immortal\r\nfame.”[475] And Hugh Lawson White, himself a banker, a statesman, a man\r\nof property, and a patriot of impeccable purity, declared that it would\r\ngive to Jackson a more enduring fame and deeper gratitude than the\r\ngreatest of his victories in the field.\r\n\r\nBoth parties were satisfied with the Message.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nNever in the history of the Republic had feeling been aroused to a more\r\ndangerous pitch than during the period of the Bank fight. Senator White,\r\na calm, well-poised man of years, was not at all certain that even he\r\ncould escape a personal encounter. “Everything here is in a bustle,” he\r\nwrote. “Nothing out of which mischief can be made is suffered to\r\nslumber. Ill blood is produced by almost every event; and a great\r\ndisposition is manifested by some to appeal to the trial of battle....\r\nNo man can tell when or with whom he is to be involved. I will do all\r\nthat a prudent man ought to do to avoid difficulties, but should it be\r\nmy lot to have them forced upon me, my reliance is that Providence will\r\nguide me through them safely.”[476]\r\n\r\nThe debate in the Senate following the Veto Message was significant. The\r\ngreat Field Marshals of the Bank, who had maintained silence until now,\r\nappeared upon the scene with impassioned speeches of denunciation and\r\nsolemn warning. The import of the speeches of Clay and Webster could not\r\nhave been clearer. They were designed to intimidate the electorate into\r\nvoting against Jackson by the most gloomy predictions of panic and\r\ndistress. Webster, who spoke first and made by long odds the most\r\npowerful presentation against the Veto, dwelt with funereal melancholy\r\nupon the President’s determination to overturn American institutions,\r\nbasing this absurd theory on the unhappy sentence referred to above.\r\n\r\nBut the one note he struck in the beginning and pounded to the end was\r\nthat of intimidation. The country was prosperous and yet there was “an\r\nunaccountable disposition to destroy the most useful and most approved\r\ninstitutions of the Government.” Unless Jackson should be defeated at\r\nthe polls the Bank would fall, and in its fall pull down the pillars of\r\nprosperity and involve all in a common ruin. The Bank would have to call\r\nin its debts at once. The distress would be especially acute in the\r\nStates on the Mississippi and its waters--where votes were needed for\r\nClay. There thirty millions of the Bank’s money was out on loans and\r\ndiscounts, and how could this be immediately collected without untold\r\nsuffering and misery? The great orator, however, evidently afraid that\r\nhis hints at the election had been too subtle, soon threw off the mask\r\nboldly.\r\n\r\n“An important election is at hand,” he said, “and the renewal of the\r\nBank Charter is a pending object of great interest, and some excitement.\r\nShould not the opinions of men high in office and candidates for\r\nreëlection be known on this as on other important questions?” And thence\r\nhe argued that the life of the Republic, the preservation of the\r\nConstitution, the salvation of society from anarchy, and the prosperity\r\nof the people, were all inseparably interwoven with the National Bank\r\nand the candidacy of Clay. “No old school Federalist,” says Van Buren,\r\n“who had grown to man’s estate with views and opinions in regard to the\r\ncharacter of the people which that faith seldom failed to inspire, could\r\ndoubt the efficacy of such an exposition in turning the minds of all\r\nclasses of the community in the desired direction.”[477]\r\n\r\nIf the Veto was satisfactory to the Whigs--to the surprise of the\r\nDemocrats--Webster’s avowed purpose to make it the issue in the campaign\r\nwas satisfactory to the Democrats--to the equal astonishment of the\r\nWhigs. When the great New England orator sat down, Hugh Lawson White of\r\nTennessee, a banker, fluent, logical, and forceful, lost no time in\r\naccepting Webster’s “issue.”\r\n\r\n“I thank the Senator,” he said, “for the candid avowal, that unless the\r\nPresident will sign such a charter as will suit the directors, they\r\nintend to interfere in the election, and endeavor to displace him. With\r\nthe same candor I state, that after this declaration, this charter shall\r\nnever be renewed with my consent.... Sir, if under these circumstances\r\nthe charter is renewed, the elective franchise is destroyed, and the\r\nliberties and prosperity of the people are delivered over to this\r\nmoneyed institution, to be disposed of at their discretion. Against this\r\nI enter my solemn protest.”\r\n\r\nEven the most ardent supporters of Clay will hardly point to his speech\r\non the Veto as evidence of his power. Compared with Webster’s or\r\nWhite’s, it was mere froth, lacking in both substance and style, and\r\nonly notable in its insistence that the failure of the recharter would\r\nbe fatal to the West, as the continuance of Jackson in office would be\r\nsubversive of all government.\r\n\r\nThe reply of Benton was characteristic in its slashing style, its\r\nexhaustive appeal to facts and figures, and chiefly important as a\r\ncampaign argument in its elaborate discussion of the relations of the\r\nBank with the Western States. Not to be outdone in dire predictions, he\r\ninsisted that the triumph of the Bank would mean the end of free\r\ninstitutions; that “no individual could stand in the States against the\r\npower of the Bank, and the Bank flushed with the victory over the\r\nconqueror of the conquerors of Bonaparte”; that “an oligarchy would be\r\nimmediately established, and that oligarchy, in a few generations, would\r\nripen into a monarchy.” He realized that all nations must ultimately\r\nperish. “Rome had her Pharsalia and Greece her Chæronea, and this\r\nRepublic, more illustrious in her birth, was entitled to a death as\r\nglorious as theirs.” He would not have her “die by poison” or “perish\r\nin corruption,” but “a field of arms and glory should be her end.”\r\n\r\nAnd he, too, eagerly accepted the challenge of Webster: “Why debate the\r\nBank question now, and not before?” he asked. “With what object do they\r\nspeak? Sir, this _post facto_ debate is not for the Senate, nor the\r\nPresident, nor to alter the fate of the Bank Bill. It is to arouse the\r\nofficers of the Bank--to direct the efforts of its mercenaries in their\r\ndesigns upon the people--to bring out its streams of corrupting\r\ninfluence, by inspiring hope, and to embody all its recruits at the\r\npolls to vote against Jackson. Without an avowal we would all know this;\r\nbut we have not been left without an avowal. The Senator from\r\nMassachusetts commenced his speech by showing that Jackson must be put\r\ndown; that he stood as an impassable barrier between the Bank and a new\r\ncharter; and that the road to success was through the ballot boxes at\r\nthe presidential election. The object of this debate is then known,\r\nconfessed, declared, avowed; the Bank is in the field; enlisted for the\r\nwar; a battering ram--the catapulta, not of the Romans but of the\r\nNational Republicans [Whigs]; not to beat down the walls of hostile\r\ncities, but to beat down the citadel of American liberty; to batter down\r\nthe rights of the people; to destroy a patriot and a hero; to command\r\nthe elections and to elect a Bank President.”\r\n\r\nThus the politicians sounded the keynotes of the two parties in the\r\napproaching campaign in the country.\r\n\r\nThe debate was not to end without its serio-comedy. Benton had\r\ncriticized Clay for lack of decent courtesy to the President, and when\r\nhe resumed his seat, Clay arose to question the Missourian’s\r\nqualification to pass on decent courtesy, and to revive the story that\r\nBenton had once said that should Jackson ever reach the Presidency,\r\nSenators “would have to legislate with pistols and dirks.” Benton\r\nexcitedly denied it. The lie was passed. The angry statesmen were called\r\nto order and forced to apologize to the Senate, and thus the Whig\r\nnominee for the Presidency closed the debate in a none too dignified\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\nThe necessary two thirds to override the veto could not be mustered, and\r\nClay left Washington on the adjournment of Congress, July 16th, happy in\r\nthe knowledge that “something had turned up” that would force the Bank\r\nand all its resources and influence to battle with a personal motive for\r\nhis election.\r\n\r\nAnd Jackson and his friends were jubilant.\r\n\r\nThus ended one of the longest and most bitter sessions the American\r\nCongress had ever known, “fierce in the beginning, and becoming more\r\nfurious to the end.”[478]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE DRAMATIC BATTLE OF 1832\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe campaign of 1832 marked the beginning of many things that have come\r\nto be commonplace in American politics. For the first time the\r\npoliticians were under the compulsion of cultivating and conciliating,\r\nnot factions and groups, but the masses of the people. The day of\r\nDemocracy had dawned, with all that means of good and evil. And in this\r\nstruggle for the suffrage of the masses, Clay had unwittingly intrigued\r\nthe Jacksonians into the advantage. Accustomed for years to relying\r\nsolely on the wealthy and the influential, the great Whig leaders\r\nsignally failed to appreciate that the very elements they had rallied to\r\ntheir support would tend to alienate the mechanics of the cities, the\r\nfarmers of the plains, the pioneers struggling with poverty on the\r\nfringe of the forest. Thurlow Weed, who was one of the few practical\r\nWhig politicians, saw it, but he was then comparatively obscure. The\r\nclever politicians of the Kitchen Cabinet instantly sensed the\r\nopportunity and grasped it. A great moneyed institution, never popular\r\nwith the masses, was seeking the humiliation of the most popular of\r\nPresidents. The most fortunate of that day were responding to the call\r\nof the Bank. The first battle at the polls between the “soul-less\r\ncorporation” and the “sons of toil” was on. For the first time in a\r\npresidential election the demagogue appeared with his appeals to class\r\nprejudice and class hate, and all the demagogy was not on the part of\r\nthe Jacksonians. If these sought to arouse the masses against the\r\nprosperous, the prosperous, with gibes about the “mob,” were quite as\r\nbusy in prejudicing the classes against the masses.\r\n\r\nAnd in this campaign the press played a more conspicuous and important\r\npart than ever before. The Jacksonians, who had tested the political\r\npossibilities of the press four years before, had perfected an\r\norganization throughout the country dependent on the editorial lead of\r\nthe “Globe.” If the political leaders of the Whigs were even now slow to\r\ngrasp the potentiality of publicity, Nicholas Biddle of the Bank was\r\nmore alert, and, through his agency, the powerful “New York Courier and\r\nEnquirer,” edited by James Watson Webb, deserted the Democracy to\r\nespouse the cause of Clay and “the monster.” That money played a part in\r\nthe conversion was soon established in a congressional investigation;\r\nand when the “National Intelligencer,” the Whig organ, joyously hailed\r\nthe convert, Blair was able sarcastically to comment on its being\r\n“charmed with his [Webb’s] honesty and independence in complying with\r\nhis bargain with the Bank--and the bold, frank and honorable way in\r\nwhich he unsays all that he has said in favor of the President for the\r\nprice paid him by Mr. Biddle.”[479] Thus the editors in 1832 fought with\r\na ferocity never before approached.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning Amos Kendall realized that the appeal would have to\r\nbe made to the masses. He therefore conceived the idea of inaugurating\r\nthe campaign with a more solemn and dignified appeal to the more\r\nintellectual element. The result was a carefully prepared campaign\r\ndocument reviewing the work of the first three years of Jackson’s\r\nAdministration. With a master hand he marshaled the triumphs of the\r\nAdministration, and marched them--an imposing procession--before the\r\nreader. He anticipated and met all attacks. If parasites on the public\r\nservice had been displaced by friends of Jackson, the new blood had\r\ninjected new energy into the public offices. Business, long in arrears,\r\nhad been brought up. Public accounts were more promptly rendered and\r\nsettled. Scamps had been detected and scourged from office, and\r\npeculations to the amount of $280,000 had been uncovered. Economy and\r\nincreased efficiency had resulted in the saving of hundreds of\r\nthousands.\r\n\r\nIn our foreign relations Kendall found nothing to be desired. Jackson\r\nhad found Colombian cruisers depredating upon our commerce, and\r\nColombian ports subjecting American cargoes to oppressive duties; he\r\nsecured indemnities and the reduction of duties and the admission of\r\nAmerican vessels to Colombian waters on the same footing as those of\r\nColombia. He found no treaty with Turkey and the waters of the Bosphorus\r\nclosed to us; he negotiated a treaty and our flag waved in the\r\nBosphorus. He found no treaty with Austria--one was negotiated; a\r\nsuspended treaty with Mexico--it was put in operation; the indemnity\r\nclaims against Denmark for spoliation unpressed--he collected $750,000;\r\nthe British West Indian controversy entangled by unskilled diplomacy--he\r\nuntangled it with skillful diplomacy, and won a victory for American\r\ncommerce; the French spoliation claims held in abeyance--and he\r\ntriumphed there.\r\n\r\nThis brilliant foreign policy, he continued, had breathed new life into\r\nour domestic and foreign commerce, until “a commercial activity scarcely\r\nequaled in our history” was enjoyed. The hammers were heard in the\r\nshipyards, laborers were employed at high wages, prosperity pervaded\r\nevery class and section. At Boston alone fifteen vessels were fitting\r\nout for trade in the Black Sea.\r\n\r\nDespite these achievements Kendall complained that the President’s\r\npolitical foes had devoted their energy and ingenuity to obstruction\r\nalone. Congress had refused or delayed the necessary appropriations,\r\ndenied him the means to maintain a mission to France, refused to confirm\r\nthe appointment of his Minister to England, trumped up charges of fraud\r\nagainst his friends, resorted to childish investigations, charged the\r\nPresident with sending bullies to attack members of Congress and to spy\r\nupon them, and capped the climax of insufferable impudence with\r\nresolutions to inquire into the private conversations of the hero of New\r\nOrleans.\r\n\r\nThis campaign document, the first of its kind, was sent broadcast over\r\nthe country to awaken the indignation of the faithful and to revive and\r\nintensify the cry, “Hurrah for Jackson.”[480] And it had the effect\r\nintended. The Jacksonians became all the more militant, ready to pounce\r\nupon and rend their enemies. Even the courageous Tyler, unfriendly to\r\nJackson, cautioned his daughter in a letter home--“Speak of me always as\r\na Jackson man whenever you are questioned.”[481] With this document in\r\nthe hands of the intellectual, the Kitchen Cabinet turned with their\r\nappeal to the masses on the Bank issue. This speedily became paramount.\r\nBut Clay and the Whigs were busy with intrigues with groups, and, to\r\nunderstand the remarkable campaign in its ramifications, it is necessary\r\nto pause for a peep behind the scenes where Clay may be seen in a light\r\nother than that of a man who “would rather be right than President.” We\r\nshall find him as willing, in Virginia, to unite with the champions of\r\nthe Nullification he abhorred, as, in New York, with the party of the\r\nAnti-Masons he despised.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nAfter the fashion of the old school politician of his day, Clay relied\r\nupon intrigue, upon the cultivation of groups with special interests and\r\ngrievances. During the winter in Congress he had devoted himself to the\r\nconsolidation of business and the ultra-conservative elements behind his\r\ncandidacy. The bitterness of the contest was foreshadowed in the spring\r\nwhen Blair announced the publication of an extra weekly issue of the\r\n“Globe”; and in August, Duff Green made a similar announcement as to the\r\n“Telegraph.” While Clay planned to win on the Bank issue, he very early\r\nbegan a furious flirtation with the Nullifiers and the Anti-Masons,\r\nthus injecting side issues that the Jacksonians were quick to accept. In\r\nApril, Clay was writing a Virginia friend[482] of a possible coalition\r\nwith the Nullification forces in three or four Southern States where\r\nextreme State-Rights views were prevalent. Governor Floyd of Virginia,\r\ndestined to receive the electoral vote of the South Carolina Nullifiers,\r\nand for a time alienated from Clay, was making overtures for a\r\nconciliation. Duff Green, a messenger in Calhoun’s livery, had made a\r\nremarkable proposition. The purport of this proposition was that\r\nCalhoun’s friends would present his name for the Presidency if assured\r\nof three or four of the Southern States; that about August he would be\r\nannounced as a candidate; that if arrangements could be made with Clay\r\nto place no electoral ticket in the field in Virginia, and to throw the\r\nsupport of his friends to Calhoun, the latter could carry the Old\r\nDominion; that carrying Virginia, he would have a fair chance of\r\ncarrying North Carolina, Georgia, and South Carolina, with a fighting\r\nchance in Alabama and Mississippi; and, accomplishing that, he could\r\ndefeat the reëlection of Jackson, and force the determination of the\r\nissue upon the House of Representatives where Clay would no doubt be\r\nelected to the satisfaction of Calhoun. The wily editor made it clear to\r\nClay that he was to have no ticket in the States mentioned, and should\r\nactively coöperate with Calhoun in Virginia.\r\n\r\nAnd Clay was not shocked! But he had not “assumed that Calhoun had much\r\npolitical capital anywhere outside South Carolina,” and doubted the\r\npracticability of abandoning a ticket in Virginia because of the\r\nimputations that would follow. And yet, if Calhoun could, by any chance,\r\ncarry three or four of the Southern States, it was a consummation\r\ndevoutly to be wished. “Let me hear from you, my dear friend, upon this\r\nmatter,” he wrote, “and particularly your views as to the strength of\r\nthe party of Mr. Calhoun in Virginia. Has it not relapsed into\r\nJacksonism? Can it be brought forth again in its original force to the\r\nsupport of Mr. Calhoun? Suppose Mr. Calhoun is not put forth as a\r\ncandidate, what course, generally, will his friends in Virginia pursue?\r\nCould our friends be prevailed upon to unite upon a ticket favorable to\r\nMr. Calhoun? Or, in the event of no ticket being put up, would they not\r\ndivide between Jackson and Calhoun, the larger part probably going to\r\nJackson?”[483] The pet plan of the Calhoun conspirators failed, and in\r\nAugust, Duff Green set forth on a tour of investigation into New York\r\nand Pennsylvania, returning to Washington encouraged in the conviction\r\nthat the defeat of Jackson could be accomplished through the unification\r\nof all the hostile elements against him. In announcing the campaign\r\nextras of the “Telegraph”--could he by chance have visited the marble\r\nbank building in Philadelphia?--he declared that “we believe that our\r\nduty requires us to demonstrate that General Jackson ought not to be\r\nreëlected.” There was no mistaking the meaning of this move, and the\r\nJacksonians were instantly on their toes. Under the caption,\r\n“Consummation of the Coalition,” Blair vigorously denounced it in the\r\n“Globe.” “If Mr. Clay were elected,” he wrote, “Mr. Calhoun is well\r\naware that it would instantly establish the Southern League, which is\r\nlooked to by him as his only hope of ever attaining political power.\r\nThis is the basis of the coalition between Mr. Clay and Mr. Calhoun. It\r\nis like that of Octavius and Anthony which severed the Roman\r\nempire.”[484]\r\n\r\nThat Blair had not misinterpreted was immediately evident in the\r\nresponse of the Whig press. The influential Pleasants, of the “Richmond\r\nWhig,” warmly commended Green’s action and promised, “on the part of the\r\n‘Telegraph,’ a luminous exposé of the misrule of Jacksonism.” “Ah,”\r\nwrote Blair, “the ‘Richmond Whig’ upon the appearance of Duff Green’s\r\nproposals for a joint opposition leaps into its embrace.”[485] And from\r\nthat moment the “Globe” kept before its readers constantly the Calhoun\r\nheresy and the coalition with the Whigs. Early in September he began to\r\ndiscuss pointedly the Nullification meetings in South Carolina addressed\r\nby “Mr. Calhoun’s leading partisans,” warning that the sinister doctrine\r\nwas “subversive of the Union,” and that “by forcing a clash between the\r\nGovernment and South Carolina, Calhoun hopes to arouse the sympathy of\r\nthe entire South.” And he continued with a prescience that is now\r\nstartling: “The Vice-President, as his prospect closes upon the elevated\r\nhonors of the Federal Government, is exerting all his influence to place\r\nSouth Carolina in a position which shall compel the other Southern\r\nStates to unite in a new system, or confederacy, which may open new\r\nviews to his ambition.”[486]\r\n\r\nThus, burning all bridges as far as the Nullifiers were concerned, the\r\nJacksonian leaders, in the interest of the President, concentrated on\r\ncapitalizing their connection with the Whigs and the Bank. When Whig\r\nand Bank papers warmly recommended the “Telegraph” to the patronage\r\nof the Clay supporters, Blair gave the recommendation publicity,\r\nwith the suggestion that “that paper is the open advocate of Calhoun\r\nand Nullification.” Thus he forced the coalition into the open. “Are\r\nnot the Bank party turning to the Nullifiers?” he asked. “If not,\r\nwhy do they circulate the extra of Duff Green which is devoted to\r\nNullification?”[487] Thus, by boldly repudiating and defying the\r\nNullification element and Calhoun, the Jackson leaders more than\r\nneutralized any benefit that Clay and the Whigs might receive from\r\ntheir sympathy and support.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nBut more important to Clay than the attitude of the Nullifiers was that\r\nof the Anti-Masons. Strangely enough, he had, at first, looked upon the\r\ngrowing movement, not only with complacency, but with approval. After\r\nthe failure of the new party in New York in 1830, he had written to a\r\nfriend: “If they had been successful they would probably have brought\r\nout an Anti-Masonic candidate for President. Still, if I had been in New\r\nYork, I should have given my suffrage to Granger.[488] I will not\r\ntrouble you with the reasons.”[489] In the same letter, however, he\r\nexpresses the opinion that such strength as the proscriptive party might\r\nmuster would ultimately go to the Whigs, in general, and himself in\r\nparticular, because “it is in conformity with the general nature of\r\nminorities,” when they have no candidate of their own, to support the\r\nstrongest opposition party. Then, too, they were protectionists, had\r\nbeen abused by Van Buren’s organization in New York, “and General\r\nJackson has, as they think, persecuted them.” At any rate, wrote the\r\nintriguing politician, “there is no occasion for our friends to attack\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\nBut a new light broke for Clay when, in the spring of 1831, the\r\nAnti-Masons called a national convention, to meet two months before the\r\nWhigs’. His close friends became apprehensive. The sounding of the\r\nAnti-Masons disclosed no Clay sentiment. Quite the contrary. Much\r\ndistressed at this revelation, one of the leaders of the movement urged\r\nhim to exert his well-known powers of conciliation.[490] By the latter\r\npart of June he had concluded that the new party might not prove so\r\nadvantageous after all. Writing to his bosom friend, Francis Brooke, he\r\nfound that “Anti-Masonry seems to be the only difficulty now in the way\r\nof success, both in Pennsylvania and New York.”[491] By the middle of\r\nJuly he was convinced that “it would be politic to leave the Jackson\r\nparty exclusively to abuse the Antis.”[492] A few days later he had\r\nconcluded that “the policy of the Antis is to force us to their\r\nsupport,” and that “ours should be to win them to ours.”[493]\r\n\r\nAs the time for the convention approached, the Antis were split on Clay,\r\na small portion wishing the nomination of one who would later withdraw\r\nin his favor, but the majority hoping for the nomination of one who\r\nwould be acceptable to the Whigs in their convention two months later.\r\nThe problem was finally solved by the nomination of William Wirt.\r\n\r\nThat this brilliant man would have scorned the honor on any other theory\r\nthan that his nomination would be acceptable to both the Whigs and Clay,\r\nwith whom he had served in the Cabinet, and for whom he entertained an\r\naffection, is shown in his correspondence.[494] But, while resting at\r\nAshland and still ignorant of the convention’s action, Clay was writing\r\nto Brooke that “if the alternative is between Andrew Jackson and an\r\nAnti-Masonic candidate with his exclusive prescriptive principles, I\r\nshould be embarrassed in the choice.”[495]\r\n\r\nIn the interval between the two conventions, the Anti-Masons clung\r\ndesperately to the hope that Clay would do violence to his dominating,\r\ndomineering disposition by sacrificing himself. He was an intimate\r\nfriend of Wirt’s. Their views on fundamentals were alike. With Wirt\r\nelected, Clay would be the power behind the throne. With a divided\r\nopposition, Jackson’s election would be inevitable, and Clay hated him\r\nwith a consuming hate. For identical reasons the Whigs hoped that, on\r\nthe nomination of Clay, Wirt would retire in his favor. As the Whig\r\nconvention approached, Wirt abandoned all hope of his own nomination.\r\n“There seems to be no doubt of Mr. Clay’s nomination in the convention\r\nnext week,” he wrote to Judge Carr. “So be it. In a personal point of\r\nview I shall feel that I have made a lucky escape.”[496] After the\r\nnomination of Clay, it was the ardent wish of Wirt to withdraw. His\r\nintimations to his party’s leaders only brought the assurance that were\r\nthe party dissolved there “were not enough Clay men among them to touch\r\nNew York or Pennsylvania, nor consequently to elect Mr. Clay,” and he\r\nwas reluctantly forced to the conclusion that “there [was] no more\r\nchance for Mr. Clay with the Anti-Masons than for the Pope of\r\nRome.”[497] But the absurdity of his situation annoyed him, and he was\r\nsoon wishing for “a little villa in Florida, or somewhere else, to\r\nretire to, and beguile the painful hours, as Cicero did, in writing\r\nessays.”\r\n\r\nIf he remained in the field, it was because Henry Clay preferred it. The\r\nrelations of the ostensible rivals were close and confidential\r\nthroughout the campaign. Clay feared that Wirt’s withdrawal would be\r\nascribed to his influence, and would intensify the Anti-Masonic feeling\r\nagainst him. Then, again, the Whig board of strategy planned to deprive\r\nJackson of the electoral vote of New York and Pennsylvania through an\r\ningenious combination of the two opposition parties in those States. In\r\nNew York the proscriptive party, meeting first, endorsed its national\r\nnominees, and nominated leaders of their own for Governor and\r\nLieutenant-Governor. With great cunning they selected an electoral\r\nticket, including Chancellor Kent, an idolater of Clay. The Whigs\r\nfollowed, and accepted the Anti-Masonic ticket, and thus the Opposition\r\nwas consolidated in the Empire State. There was no mystery as to the\r\nintent in regard to the State ticket--it was to have the united support\r\nof both parties. The weakness, with the public, was the absence of any\r\nindication as to the intended disposal of the electoral vote. The plan\r\nof the conspirators was to throw the electoral votes to Wirt provided\r\nthere was a possibility of his election, or no possibility of the\r\nelection of either Wirt or Clay; and for Clay in the event Wirt could\r\nnot win and the Whig nominee could with the electoral vote of New\r\nYork.[498] The plan met with the hearty approval of Clay, who\r\nentertained high hopes of its success in depriving Jackson of the\r\nelectoral vote upon which his election depended.[499] Thus, before the\r\ncampaign had fairly started, the politicians of these two parties were\r\nworking in close coöperation with a complete understanding, while the\r\nrank and file of both parties were left entirely in the dark. Wirt, with\r\nno faith in the coalition, was doing nothing to advance his\r\ncandidacy.[500] Thus the nominee of one party was secretly planning to\r\ndeliver the prize to the man his own party had repudiated. Not only did\r\nhe write no letters to advance his party’s cause, but he “refused to\r\nanswer whenever such answers could be interpreted as canvassing for\r\noffice.”[501]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Jacksonians were merely amused at these intrigues of the\r\nold school politicians. The secret of their strength, here as always,\r\nwas in their daring. Not only did they ignore the Anti-Masons and refuse\r\nto conciliate them, but they cast them off as completely as they had the\r\nNullifiers. The highest member of the Masonic order in America was at\r\nthe head of Jackson’s Cabinet, and John Quincy Adams gave the utmost\r\npublicity to the fact by addressing his attacks on Masonry to Edward\r\nLivingston. Jackson himself sought and found an opportunity to go on\r\nrecord against the prescriptive hysteria. In this manner the Jacksonian\r\nmanagers rallied the Masons to their banner, and they held in their\r\nhands the ammunition with which to blow to atoms the plan of the\r\ncoalition leaders to deliver the rank and file of the enemies of Masonry\r\nto Clay.\r\n\r\nEarly in October Blair published in the “Globe,” without comment,\r\nClay’s manly letter to some Anti-Masons in Indiana refusing to be drawn\r\ninto sectarian quarrels. “If a President of the United States ... were\r\nto employ his official power to sustain, or to abolish, or to advance\r\nthe interest of Masonry or Anti-Masonry,” he had written, “it would be\r\nan act of usurpation and tyranny.”[502] That was enough. The Democratic\r\npress of the country, taking the cue from the “Globe,” reproduced the\r\nletter, and thus the rank and file of the party everywhere was\r\nstrengthened in its determination not to support its author.\r\n\r\nWhile Clay was intriguing with the Nullifiers and the Anti-Masons, the\r\nDemocrats were audaciously denouncing both, and were gaining rather than\r\nlosing by their temerity.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nThere was but one issue--and that the Bank. Clay had made it the issue\r\nwith the officers of the institution and their allied business\r\ninterests; the clever leaders of the Jackson forces made it an issue\r\nwith the masses of the people, who had always looked with suspicion and\r\ndislike upon the powerful financial institution.[503] And then, perhaps,\r\nthe “Emperor Nicholas” bitterly regretted having yielded to the\r\nblandishments of Clay. If he had not considered the cost in money to the\r\ninstitution when he yielded, Clay understood it as well as Webster. They\r\nknew that a fight against the “weak old man,” as they foolishly called\r\nJackson, would be “no holiday affair.” Satisfied of the support of the\r\nbusiness element, they had calculated the cost of reaching the people\r\ngenerally--and they had the work of Biddle cut out for him.[504] And\r\nalmost immediately, Biddle was as deeply involved as Clay himself.\r\n\r\nThe campaign plans of the two parties differed, since their special\r\nappeals were to different elements. The Clay men relied on the\r\ndistribution, with Bank money, of the printed speeches of Clay, Webster,\r\nand Calhoun, of tracts and pamphlets. These, falling into the hands of\r\nthe masses, were thrown aside. They were sympathetically perused by the\r\nbankers, merchants, manufacturers, preachers, professors, and lawyers\r\nwho were in no need of conversion.[505] The Bank made desperate efforts\r\nto win to its support the press of the larger cities and towns. It was\r\nnotoriously willing to prove its appreciation of such support with the\r\ncoin of the realm.[506] That Webb’s paper had been won over with Bank\r\nmoney was common knowledge after the congressional investigation, and\r\nAmos Kendall, in the “Globe,” charged that the “Evening Post” had been\r\n“approached,” and that the “Standard” of Philadelphia had been offered\r\nfive hundred dollars and a new set of type, and the inducement had been\r\nincreased by five hundred dollars two days later.\r\n\r\nThoroughly frightened, Biddle spent lavishly for the printing and\r\ndistribution of speeches and articles. Mailing the president of the\r\nKentucky Bank[507] Webster’s speech on the Veto, and an article\r\nreviewing the Message, he instructed that these, “as well as Mr. Clay’s\r\n& Mr. Ewing’s speeches on the same subject,” be “printed and\r\ndispersed.”[508] More than $80,000--an enormous sum for those days--was\r\nspent by the Bank under the head of “stationery and printing” during the\r\nperiod of the campaign. Thousands of friendly newspapers were bought in\r\nbulk and scattered broadcast, and Blair announced the discovery that\r\n“about four bushels of the ‘Extra Telegraph’ is sent to New York to a\r\nsingle individual for distribution.”[509] An analysis of Benton’s speech\r\nand a reply was printed in pamphlet form, and thousands flooded the\r\ncountry and burdened the mails.\r\n\r\nBut more sinister still was the appearance, for the first time in\r\nAmerican politics, of the weapons of intimidation and coercion. In New\r\nOrleans a bank commenced discounting four months’ paper at eight per\r\ncentum--“because of the veto.” An advertisement appeared in a Cincinnati\r\npaper offering $2.50 per hundred for pork if Clay should be elected,\r\n$1.50 if Jackson won--a bribe of one dollar a head on each hundred\r\npounds of pork. From Brownsville, Pennsylvania, went forth the\r\ndisturbing report that “a large manufacturer has discharged all his\r\nhands, and others have given notice to do so,” and that “not a single\r\nsteam boat will be built this season at Wheeling, Pittsburg or\r\nLouisville.” From Baltimore: “A great many mechanics are thrown out of\r\nemployment by the stoppage of building. The prospect ahead is that we\r\nshall have a very distressing winter.” And so the work went on, with the\r\nBank and its political champions holding the sword of Damocles over the\r\nheads of the masses who dared to vote for Jackson.[510] Jackson was held\r\nbefore the conservative and timid as rash, dangerous, destructive.\r\nWebster’s State convention speech at Worcester, expanding on the\r\nunfortunate sentence from the Veto Message as to the finality of Supreme\r\nCourt decisions, was given general circulation. Even the brilliant\r\nRitchie, of the “Richmond Enquirer,” lived in constant terror of some\r\nrash act of Jackson’s that would wreck the country.[511]\r\n\r\nFor the benefit of the ardent Jacksonians who disliked and distrusted\r\nVan Buren, the nominee for Vice-President, the Whig and Bank press\r\ngravely quoted some mysterious “Philadelphian” to whom Jackson had said,\r\n“with his own lips,” that a reëlection would satisfy him as a\r\nvindication, and that he would resign and go home, leaving Van Buren in\r\nthe Presidency. Even the “National Intelligencer” referred to the rumor\r\nas “the disclosure of an important fact ... going to confirm our own\r\nimpressions.” And Blair had been forced to notice and denounce the story\r\nwith the comment that “we had always thought Simpson the most depraved\r\nof all the miscreants purchased by the Bank, but certainly now\r\nGales[512] deserves to be put below him.”[513] Earlier in the campaign\r\nthe Whigs had attempted to serve the same purpose by circulating\r\nalarming reports regarding Jackson’s health. And Blair, in denouncing\r\nthis canard, announced that the President “receives from 50 to 100\r\npersons daily, is incessantly engaged in the despatch of the duties of\r\nhis office, and joins regularly at table his large dinner parties of\r\nfrom 40 to 50 persons twice a week.”[514]\r\n\r\nFor the benefit of the preachers, teachers, and moral forces, the old\r\nstories of Jackson’s bloodthirstiness were revived, apropos of the\r\nattack by Sam Houston on a member of Congress. At first the President\r\nhad merely instigated the assault--and then the imaginative Whig scribes\r\nworked out a bloodcurdling, circumstantial story. After the brutal\r\nattack, the swaggering Houston had met Postmaster-General Barry at the\r\ntheater, and the two had talked it over at the theater bar, and, after\r\nbeing congratulated by the Cabinet member, he had called on Jackson and\r\nbeen heartily commended for his act.\r\n\r\nThus the Whigs used every weapon that came into their hands--money,\r\nsubsidized and bought papers, the hostility to Masonry, the hate of the\r\nNullifiers, the fear of Van Buren, intimidation, coercion, and slander.\r\nAnd something comparatively new to politics--the cartoon--soon became a\r\nfeature of the fight. Here the Democrats were at a disadvantage, and the\r\npictorial editorials that have come down to us are largely anti-Jackson.\r\nHere we find the President pictured as a raving maniac, as Don Quixote\r\ntilting at the pillars of the splendid marble bank building in\r\nPhiladelphia, as a burglar attempting to force the bank doors with a\r\nbattering ram, while the most popular cartoon among the friends of Clay\r\npictured Jackson receiving a crown from Van Buren and a scepter from the\r\nDevil.[515]\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nBut all the while the consummate politicians of the Jackson party were\r\nreaching and arousing the masses. Long before the opening of the\r\ncampaign, Amos Kendall, Lewis, Hill, and Blair were cunningly appealing\r\nto the interests, the prejudices, and the hero worship of the voters of\r\nthe cornfield and the village. These forerunners of the modern\r\npolitician were keenly appreciative of the fact that between 1824 and\r\n1832 a great body of voters, previously proscribed because of their\r\npoverty and lack of property, had been newly enfranchised. With the\r\nWhigs these were non-existent. The journalistic training of Kendall,\r\nHill, and Blair pointed to the press as the surest way to reach the\r\nmasses with their propaganda. The old-fashioned politician still\r\naffected a contempt for the press, and particularly for the little\r\nstruggling papers of the country. The genius of Kendall immediately\r\nseized upon these, and, long before the campaign began, the sallow,\r\nprematurely gray young man of mystery, shut up in his petty office in\r\nthe Treasury, was busy night and day, and especially at night, preparing\r\narticles and editorials laudatory of the Jackson policies, denunciatory\r\nof the Opposition, and these, sent to editors all over the country, were\r\nprinted as their own. Thus the followers of Jackson in every nook and\r\ncorner of the country were constantly supplied with ammunition in the\r\nshape of arguments they could comprehend and assimilate.\r\n\r\nThe center and soul of the Democratic organization was the office of the\r\n“Globe.” Among the papers of national reputation, but two others were\r\nsupporting Jackson, the “New Hampshire Patriot” of “Ike” Hill, and Van\r\nBuren’s organ, the “Albany Argus.” But the “Globe” was equal to the\r\ndemand upon it. Doubling the number of issues, the ferociously partisan\r\nBlair sat in the office writing feverishly, with Kendall gliding in and\r\nout with copy. Both possessed a genius for controversy. Both had\r\nmastered a style combining literary qualities, attractive to the\r\neducated, with the “pep” and “punch” that impressed, interested,\r\ndelighted, the multitude. Blair dipped his pen in vitriol. In satire and\r\nsarcasm he had few equals. He was no parlor warrior, and he struck\r\nresounding blows like a boiler-maker. And he wrote in a flowing style\r\nthat, at times, approached real eloquence. Having the average man in\r\nmind, his editorials, filling the greater part of the paper, were\r\nconcise and brief. When language seemed weak, he resorted to italics.\r\nThe longer and more sustained argumentative articles were written by the\r\nmore brilliant Kendall. Through July, August, September, and October he\r\nwrote a series of articles on “The Bank and the Veto,” beginning in an\r\nargumentative vein, and gradually growing personal until he was devoting\r\none issue to the financial connections between the Bank and Duff Green,\r\nanother to similar connections of Webb, of the “Courier and Enquirer,”\r\nand another to Gales, of the “Intelligencer.”\r\n\r\nInfuriated by the gibes, taunts, and attacks, the Whigs charged that the\r\n“Globe” was being distributed gratuitously--the business manager replied\r\nwith an affidavit as to the legitimacy of its circulation.[516] News of\r\nthe deepest import was crowded out by the exigencies of the campaign,\r\nand with the cholera scourge taking a heavy toll of lives in Washington,\r\nthe only mention of it in the “Globe” was in the official reports of the\r\nBoard of Health. But there was room for columns of quotations from\r\nDemocratic papers on the Veto, all striking the exultant key--“The\r\nMonster is Destroyed.”\r\n\r\nOnly the persistent hammering of the Whigs on the unfortunate sentence\r\nof the Veto Message caused acute distress in Democratic circles.\r\nWebster’s Worcester speech was annoying. Here a sneer, there a gibe in\r\nthe “Globe,” but sneers and gibes did not quite satisfy the editor, who\r\nfinally made a laborious effort to explain,[517] and, finding the effort\r\ntame, Blair countercharged with the publication of Clay’s bitter\r\nanti-Bank speech of 1811 with appropriate comments upon it from the\r\nJacksonian papers of the country.\r\n\r\nAs the campaign approached the end, Blair stressed the theory that the\r\nreal fight was between Jackson and the Bank, with Clay a mere pawn in\r\nthe game. “We see,” he wrote, “the most profligate apostasies invited\r\nand applauded--the grossest misrepresentations circulated--the worst\r\nforgeries committed--open briberies practiced, and all for what? Not\r\navowedly to elect Henry Clay or William Wirt, but any ‘available\r\ncandidate’[518]--in other words, any candidate with whom, in the end,\r\nthe Bank directors can make the best bargain.”[519] And a week later,\r\nunder the caption, “The Gold,” Blair announces that through private\r\nadvices “we learn that certain heavy trunks, securely hooped with iron,\r\nhave arrived at Lexington[520] from the East.”[521] Such was the\r\ncharacter of the publicity with which the Jacksonians appealed to the\r\nmasses of the people.\r\n\r\nBut the practical minds of the leaders of the Kitchen Cabinet were not\r\ncontent with creating public opinion--they systematically organized and\r\ndirected it. In every community, no matter how obscure, some Jackson\r\nleader, with a genius for organization work, was busy welding the\r\nJackson forces into a solid mass. Here Major Lewis took charge. He\r\nanticipated the card-index system of the modern politicians. There was\r\nscarcely a county in the country in which he did not know the precise\r\nman or men upon whom absolute reliance could be placed. And “Ike” Hill,\r\nnow a United States Senator, made an extensive organizing tour through\r\nOhio and Pennsylvania in early August.\r\n\r\nIn both publicity and organization, the greater part of the ability and\r\nall the genius was with Jackson.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nThe Jacksonians depended also to a greater extent than the Opposition on\r\nappeals to the people, face to face. A creature of another world,\r\nlooking down from the skies upon the United States in the late summer\r\nand autumn of 1832, would have concluded that its people moved about in\r\nenormous processions on horseback, with waving flags, branches and\r\nbanners. Great meetings were held in groves, addressed by fiery orators,\r\nfuriously denouncing “The Monster” and the “Corporation” and calling\r\nupon the people to “stand by the Hero.” Men left their homes, bade\r\nfarewell to their families as though enlisting for a war, and rode from\r\none meeting to another for weeks at a time.[522] Nor was this hysterical\r\nenthusiasm confined to the more primitive sections of the country. A\r\nFrench traveler sojourning in New York City was profoundly impressed by\r\na Jackson parade there. “It was nearly a mile long,” he wrote. “The\r\nDemocrats marched in good order to the glare of torches; the banners\r\nwere more numerous than I have ever seen in any religious festival; all\r\nwere in transparency on account of the darkness. On some were inscribed\r\nthe names of Democratic societies, or sections; others bore imprecations\r\nagainst the Bank of the United States. Nick Biddle and Old Nick here\r\nfigured largely.... From farther than the eye could reach came marching\r\non the Democrats. The procession stopped before the houses of the\r\nJackson men to fill the air with cheers, and halted at the door of the\r\nleaders of the opposition to give three, six or nine groans. These\r\nscenes belong to history and partake of the grand; they are the\r\nepisodes of a wondrous epic which will bequeath a lasting memory to\r\nposterity.”[523]\r\n\r\nAnd into these amazing demonstrations the campaign glee club, also new\r\nto American politics, entered, to play a conspicuous part, with pretty\r\ngirls, and children gayly dressed, singing round the hickory poles that\r\nwere raised wherever there were idolaters of Jackson. And so they sang:\r\n\r\n    “Here’s a health to the heroes who fought\r\n     And conquered in Liberty’s cause;\r\n     Here’s health to Old Andy who could not be bought\r\n     To favor aristocrat laws.\r\n     Hurrah for the Roman-like Chief--\r\n     He never missed fire at all;\r\n     But ever when called to his country’s relief\r\n     Had a ready picked flint and a ball.\r\n\r\n    “Hurrah for the Hickory tree\r\n     From the mountain tops down to the sea.\r\n     It shall wave o’er the grave of the Tory and knave,\r\n     And shelter the honest and free.”[524]\r\n\r\nEven where the Whigs were strongest, the militant Democrats poured forth\r\nin defiant demonstrations. When Jackson, returning to Washington from\r\nthe Hermitage in the closing days of the campaign, approached Lexington,\r\nthe home of his rival, a multitude streamed down the road five miles to\r\nmeet him, with over a thousand on horseback and in carriages, and before\r\nhe reached his lodging the throng extended back two miles along the road\r\n“with green hickory bushes waving like bright banners in a breeze.”[525]\r\n\r\nIt was inevitable that in such a campaign personalities should intrude.\r\nIn the winter of 1831-32, while Congress was in session, Jackson took\r\nadvantage of the presence of Dr. Harris, an eminent Philadelphia\r\nsurgeon, to have the bullet from Benton’s pistol, long lodged in his\r\nshoulder, removed. When the surgeon appeared at the White House, he was\r\nengaged with company, but excused himself with the explanation that he\r\nwould have to submit to an operation; and a few hours later he\r\nreappeared among his friends with his arm in a sling. “Precisely,” wrote\r\nBlair, “as he had appeared with it in battle among the enemies of his\r\ncountry.”[526] This gave the Whigs their cue, and their press teemed\r\nwith references to the “disgusting affair” in which the shot had been\r\nfired. And Blair himself was able to retaliate in kind with the story of\r\na wound received by Clay in a personal conflict. “He was taken to a kind\r\nfriend’s house,” he wrote, “he was treated with the utmost tenderness\r\nand courtesy by that friend’s wife and family, and while enjoying their\r\nhospitality, he amused himself ... by winning the money of his kind host\r\nat Brag.”\r\n\r\nIf Jackson was a brawler, it was given out thus that Clay was not only a\r\nbrawler, but a gambler and an ingrate. Both stories made their way\r\nthrough the country.[527]\r\n\r\nIf the cholera was not of sufficient importance for the news columns of\r\nthe party press, it was rich in suggestion to the politicians. The Dutch\r\nSynod requested Jackson to set a day aside for prayer. He replied that\r\nhe had faith in the efficacy of prayer, but that the special day to be\r\nset aside should be designated by the State authorities. Whereupon Clay\r\narose to offer a resolution in the Senate setting a day aside and fixing\r\nthe day. Aha, cried Blair, he wants a veto on a religious subject. “It\r\nis not the cholera that makes them so pious; it is the hope to steal a\r\nmarch on the old Hero.... What whited sepulchers some of these partisan\r\nleaders are!” he wrote.[528]\r\n\r\nAnd when, a little later, the “Pittsburgh Statesman,” a Clay paper,\r\nsuggested that “the only effectual cure, under existing circumstances,\r\nfor genuine Jacksonism is the equally genuine Asiatic Spasmodic\r\nCholera,” the “Troy Budget,” supporting Jackson, was not surprised at\r\n“such political depravity,” coming from the “editorial slanderers and\r\nruthless murderers of Mrs. Jackson.” And “Ike” Hill, in the “New\r\nHampshire Patriot,” was reminded that Clay himself had prayed “for war,\r\npestilence and famine” in preference to the reëlection of Jackson. When\r\nthe President left the capital for the Hermitage, the “Troy Sentinel,”\r\nWhig, with its eye on the church vote, announced with emphasis that he\r\nhad left Washington “at eight o’clock on Sunday morning.” Blair,\r\ndenouncing the story as “a lie,” declared that “he did not leave the\r\ncity until Monday morning and spent the Sabbath in religious duties as\r\nusual.” When “Ike” Hill, speaking at a complimentary dinner at the Eagle\r\nCoffee House, in Concord, assailed Clay and Senator John Holmes, and\r\nreferred to some Senators as “low and blackguard,” the “National\r\nIntelligencer” protested, and Blair replied with a description of Holmes\r\nas a “besotted Senator who had indulged in indecent and ribald slang\r\nthroughout the session,” and as one given to “low buffoonery”--the “mere\r\nThersites of the Senate.”[529] Charges of impropriety touching on the\r\npersonal integrity of political leaders were commonplace. The “Globe,”\r\ncentering its fire upon the activities of the Bank, charged it with\r\nsubsidizing and seducing the press by paying for the publication of\r\npolitical speeches at advertising rates.[530] “Every press in\r\nPhiladelphia,” it said, “is closed by its influence, against the\r\nadmission of anything unfavorable to its pretensions. The ‘Mechanics’\r\nFree Press’ broke ground against it in conformity with the principles of\r\nits party, when lo! a shower of gold, amounting to $1700 for publishing\r\nMr. McDuffie’s report, silenced it, and for good reasons, doubtless, it\r\nhas ever since held its peace about the Bank.” And the Whig press was\r\nequally shocked to find that officers high in the Government were\r\nsending the “Globe” all over the country under their official frank. “A\r\nlie!” screamed Blair. And so the battle of personalities went on. From\r\nHill’s “New Hampshire Patriot” came the resurrection of the\r\nlong-discredited “bargain” story against Clay.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, what had become of the candidates and what were their\r\nfeelings as to the prospects? While scarcely due to the strain of the\r\ncampaign, all three, Jackson, Clay, and Wirt, were threatened with\r\nserious illness. As we have seen, Clay was threatened with paralysis\r\nabout the time of his retirement from the Cabinet. During the summer and\r\nautumn of 1832 the old trouble returned. His friend, Brooke, who became\r\nconcerned over his health, urged him to caution, and Clay, much moved by\r\nhis friend’s solicitude, promised to be more careful of his diet, to\r\nabstain from wine, and to reduce his consumption of tobacco to “one\r\nform.”[531] At times, during the summer session, he had been forced to\r\nleave Washington for a brief period of rest at his friend’s home at St.\r\nJulien, Virginia; and as soon as Congress adjourned, he hastened to\r\nWhite Sulphur Springs for two weeks in hope of relief from the waters.\r\nSkeptical at first of his election, his confidence increased until he\r\nand Webster were exchanging letters of congratulation on its certainty.\r\n\r\nWirt, who had a serious attack, and was in a weakened condition, was\r\nforced by his physician to leave Baltimore, rather than take a chance\r\nwith the cholera. After a brief sojourn at Bedford Springs, he went with\r\nhis family to Berkley Springs where he remained through September. Here,\r\nwith no thought of his own election, but with ardent hopes for Clay, he\r\nignored the clamor of the campaign. Riding and lounging about the\r\ngrounds during the day, regaling company with ghost stories in the\r\nevening, he bore no resemblance to a presidential candidate.[532]\r\n\r\nSoon after Congress adjourned, the scourge reached Washington, taking\r\nheavy toll of the Irish and Swedish laborers engaged in the first\r\nmacadamizing of Pennsylvania Avenue, and spreading rapidly from the\r\npoorer parts to the White House section. Because of Jackson’s weakened\r\ncondition, his physicians insisted that he spend three months at the\r\nHermitage, and near the middle of August, accompanied part of the way by\r\nAmos Kendall, Frank Blair, “Ike” Hill, Major Lewis, Lewis Cass, and\r\nBenton, he left the sweltering and infected capital and went down the\r\nOhio. He was in high glee. Never for a moment had he doubted the result\r\nof the election. During the congressional fight over the recharter bill\r\nhe had not punished those who had withheld their support by denying them\r\npatronage, except in the case of his most bitter foes. Just before the\r\nvote in the House, an Ohio Representative solicited an appointment for a\r\nconstituent, and, upon being granted the favor, he explained that he\r\nthought it due Jackson for him to know that the favor was being granted\r\na member who would vote for the Bank.\r\n\r\n“I can’t help that, sir, but I already knew it. See here--I can take a\r\nroll of the House and check off every Democrat who will vote for the\r\nBank. In fact I have one here.”\r\n\r\nTurning briskly, he produced it, and the Representative, running over\r\nthe list, indicated one name as that of a man who would vote with\r\nJackson.\r\n\r\n“How do you know?” demanded Jackson.\r\n\r\nWhen told that this Congressman had been so unmercifully berated by his\r\nconstituents that he had felt compelled to change his tack, the old\r\nwarrior smiled grimly.\r\n\r\n“He is a lucky fellow,” he said, “to get the views of his constituents\r\nbeforehand. There are several other Democrats in the House who will not\r\nget similar notice until next fall, sir.”[533]\r\n\r\nNothing occurred after that incident to alter his opinion of the\r\nsentiment of the people. As Hill left the boat bearing the presidential\r\nparty down the Ohio, at Wheeling, Jackson said, as he clasped his hand:\r\n“Isaac, it’ll be a walk. If our fellows didn’t raise a finger from now\r\non the thing would be just as well as done. In fact, Isaac, it’s done\r\nnow.”\r\n\r\nThat his friends shared his confidence we have ample evidence. Hill,\r\nwriting to a friend, advised him to bet all he could on Pennsylvania and\r\nOhio for Jackson--“not on stated majorities, but hang on to the general\r\nresult.” And he added frankly, “I am on the turf myself. Benton and his\r\nfriends out West are picking up all they can get.” John Van Buren, the\r\nson of Martin, and popularly known as “Prince John,” made a small\r\nfortune with his ventures on the election, and Hone, commenting on the\r\nmanner and appearance of Martin Van Buren, the nominee for\r\nVice-President, thought it indicated a feeling of absolute security.\r\n\r\nThe result was a notable victory for Jackson and his policies--an\r\nunmistakable rebuke to Clay. In electoral votes Jackson received 219,\r\nClay 49, and Wirt 7, and the popular vote gave Jackson 124,392 over the\r\ncombined strength of Clay and Wirt, thus proving the absurdity of\r\nThurlow Weed’s theory that if Clay had acquiesced in the wishes of the\r\nAnti-Masons he could have been elected. The only State carried by Wirt\r\nwas Vermont--as he had predicted. Clay carried Massachusetts, Rhode\r\nIsland, Connecticut, Delaware, and Kentucky, and five out of the eight\r\nelectoral votes of Maryland. All the other States went to Jackson but\r\none--South Carolina, with childish petulance, threw its vote away at the\r\nbehest of Calhoun.\r\n\r\nNothing could have been more ominous than this action. Going entirely\r\noutside the regularly nominated candidates, and acting in conformity\r\nwith the views of the Nullifying party, which insisted on placing the\r\nState outside the Union, she gave her vote to Governor Floyd of\r\nVirginia. And Jackson, getting the returns, instantly caught the\r\nsignificance of the act, and girded his loins for a life-and-death\r\nstruggle with Calhoun and Nullification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE POLITICS OF NULLIFICATION\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nCallers at the Hermitage about the first of October were surprised to\r\nfind Jackson’s thoughts remote from the election. Instead of a jubilant\r\npolitician, they found an old man frothing with fury over the news from\r\nSouth Carolina that the Nullifiers had won a majority of seats in the\r\nLegislature and were arranging for an early summoning of a Nullification\r\nConvention. His indignation was so intense that his friends were shocked\r\nat the ferocity of his mood. The crisis had not crept upon him unaware.\r\nWith keen, far-seeing eyes he had watched its advance, hoping that\r\nsomething would intervene to divert his native State from its mad\r\ncourse, but determined, if the issue came, to crush it with an iron\r\nhand. His hatred of Calhoun had, by this time, become an obsession, and\r\nwhen he threatened to “hang every leader ... of that infatuated people,\r\nsir, by martial law, irrespective of his name, or political or social\r\nposition,” there was no doubt as to whom he referred.[534] Taking no\r\nfurther interest in the election, he put the campaign behind him and\r\nhastened to the capital. Blair, the politician always, hurried to the\r\nWhite House with some papers relating to the election. After a hasty and\r\nperfunctory glance, Jackson returned them to the editor, with a “Thank\r\nyou, sir,” and launched into a denunciation of the Nullifiers. The date\r\nset for the Nullification Convention had just reached him. Even Blair,\r\naccustomed to his fits of temper, was startled. He was in the presence\r\nof a Jackson he had never seen or known before. “The lines in his face\r\nwere hard drawn, his tones were full of wrath and resentment.... Any\r\none would have thought he was planning another great battle.”[535] Even\r\nthe announcement of victory at the polls scarcely interested him. Blair\r\nand Kendall called with a table showing the electoral vote. Glancing at\r\nit indifferently for a moment, his face brightened. “The best thing\r\nabout this, gentlemen, is that it strengthens my hands in this trouble.”\r\nSuch was the spirit with which Andrew Jackson faced the gravest crisis\r\nthe Nation had yet known.\r\n\r\nBeginning with an intensely nationalistic spirit,[536] South Carolina\r\ncommenced to veer about with the tariff of 1816, and every succeeding\r\ntariff measure had been a provocation. Two years before Jackson’s\r\ninauguration, the “Brutus” articles on the “Usurpations of the Federal\r\nGovernment,” eloquent, fiery, defiant of the “Monster of the North,” had\r\ncreated a profound impression, commanding the adherence of McDuffie, the\r\nMirabeau of the disaffected, Hamilton, Preston, and Chancellor William\r\nHarper, described by Houston as “scarcely inferior to Calhoun as an\r\nexponent of meta-physical doctrines.”[537] The principles of “Brutus”\r\nonly awaited the authoritative sanction of Calhoun to place upon them\r\nthe stamp of the State’s approval.\r\n\r\nThe tariff of 1828 was the last straw, and sedition was openly talked by\r\nthe greater part of the South Carolina congressional delegation at the\r\nhome of Senator Hayne. One week later, Calhoun, at his home at Fort\r\nHill, finished his “Exposition,” enunciating the principles of\r\nNullification, which the committee of seven of the State Legislature\r\npresented as its own. During the summer, politicians made numerous\r\npilgrimages to Fort Hill for conferences, but not the scratch of a pen\r\nremains to indicate the character of the discussions. Calhoun was still\r\n“under cover.” He was about to enter upon his second term in the\r\nVice-Presidency, and his friends were looking forward to the Presidency\r\nin 1832. The world was to wait awhile for the openly avowed views of the\r\nMaster.\r\n\r\nWith the publication of the “Exposition,” the battle royal began,\r\nCavalier against Cavalier, the Union cause brilliantly led by the\r\nelegant Joel R. Poinsett. In the early stages of the fight the\r\nNullifiers did not scruple to represent Jackson as friendly to their\r\ncause. “I had supposed,” wrote Jackson, in reply to a letter from\r\nPoinsett, “that every one acquainted with me knew that I was opposed to\r\nthe Nullifying doctrine, and my toast at the Jefferson dinner was\r\nsufficient evidence of that fact.”[538] Having no reason, after that, to\r\ndoubt Jackson’s position, the Unionists invited Jackson to attend one of\r\ntheir public dinners, and he sent a letter settling beyond all\r\npossibility of dispute his position on Nullification. The Nullifiers,\r\ndining at a rival banquet, and learning of the reading of the Jackson\r\nletter, reminded the writer that “old Waxhaw still stands where Jackson\r\nleft it, and the old stock of ’76 has not run out.” After that the drama\r\nhurried to a climax. The tariff of 1832 was but oil on the flames. The\r\nfight was carried to the polls and Nullification won by a majority of\r\n6000 out of 40,000 votes cast.\r\n\r\nThe most portentous feature of the campaign was the appearance in August\r\nof Calhoun’s famous letter to Hamilton, decisively accepting as his own,\r\nand urging upon his people, the doctrine of Nullification. It was\r\nintended and timed to serve the purposes of the campaign. Unhappily\r\nCalhoun must ever remain more or less a steel engraving. His private\r\nlife was carefully screened. Jefferson prowling among the brickmasons at\r\nthe University, Jackson with his clay pipe on the veranda of the\r\nHermitage, Webster among his cattle at Marshfield, Clay meditating\r\nspeeches under the trees at Ashland, are possible of contact by future\r\ngenerations, but Calhoun at Fort Hill seems hopelessly remote and cannot\r\nbe visualized. He stalks upon the stage, a dramatic and impressive\r\nfigure, and plays his public part, but no one is admitted to the\r\ndressing-room. Thus all we know of the occasion of the preparation of\r\nthe famous letter, which became the Magna Carta of the Nullifiers, is\r\ntold in the letter itself.[539] The events of that summer and early\r\nautumn were intimately known to Jackson as he walked the grounds of the\r\nHermitage, and lingered mournfully about the tomb of his beloved Rachel.\r\nIn the spring of 1830 the brilliant Poinsett, fresh from his mission to\r\nMexico, had been shocked, on his return to the drawing-rooms of\r\nCharleston, to find sedition poured with the tea, and had hurried to\r\nWashington to be closeted with Jackson at the White House. Before he\r\nemerged, he had been designated by the President as his personal\r\nambassador in South Carolina,[540] and after calling upon Adams, in\r\nretirement, to tell him of his hopes and fears,[541] he made all haste\r\nhome to combat, inch by inch, the growing madness, and prepared, if need\r\nbe, to die with a musket in his hands. During the intervening three\r\nyears his confidential reports had kept Jackson in close touch with all\r\nthe movements of the enemy, and the grim old warrior, reëntering the\r\nWhite House on his return from Tennessee, entertained no illusions as to\r\nwhat he faced.\r\n\r\nThree days after Jackson reached Washington, the South Carolina\r\nLegislature fixed November 3d as the date for the Nullification\r\nConvention. Silently, but sternly, soldier-wise, the President was\r\nclearing the decks for action. The day he left the Hermitage the\r\nCollector of Customs in Charleston received instructions as to his\r\ncourse; on reaching the capital, the commander in charge of troops there\r\nwas warned of possible attempts to seize the forts; to his apprehensive\r\nfriends he was sending reassuring messages. “I am well advised as to\r\nthe views and proceedings of the leading Nullifiers,” he wrote Hamilton\r\non November 2d. “We are wide awake here. THE UNION WILL BE PRESERVED;\r\nREST ASSURED OF THAT.”[542] Five days later, Cass was ordering\r\nadditional troops to Fort Moultrie, and Jackson was dispatching a secret\r\nemissary to Charleston, with instructions to communicate with Poinsett,\r\nand to report upon the conditions of the forts and the lengths to which\r\nthe Nullifiers might go.[543] The day preceding the meeting of the\r\nNullification Convention, Cass ordered General Scott to Charleston, with\r\nminute instructions.[544] With Scott hurrying to South Carolina, the\r\nconvention met, the Nullification Ordinance was passed, and February 1st\r\nwas set as the day for it to go into operation. Three days after the\r\nconvention adjourned, the Legislature met and passed laws to put the\r\nordinance into effect. The Unionist Convention immediately met,\r\ndenounced Nullification, and began to organize their forces for a\r\npossible armed conflict.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Scott had performed his mission with a discretion and sound\r\njudgment which called forth the commendation of Jackson.[545] Five days\r\nbefore Congress met, five thousand stand of muskets with equipment had\r\nbeen ordered to Castle Pinckney, and a sloop of war with smaller vessels\r\nwere on their way to Charleston Harbor.[546] “The Union must be\r\npreserved, and its laws duly executed, but BY PROPER MEANS,” wrote the\r\nPresident to Poinsett.\r\n\r\nThus, in this real crisis, the “law,” the “Constitution,” and “public\r\nopinion” were uppermost in the mind of the man generally described as\r\nreckless in the use of power. Long after the event, but while the\r\ncontest was still on, he wrote to Poinsett of his regret at the failure\r\nof the Unionist Convention to memorialize Congress “to extend to you the\r\nguarantees of the Constitution, of a republican form of government,\r\nstating the actual despotism which now controls the State.” This, he\r\nexplained, “would have placed your situation before the whole nation,\r\nand filled the heart of every true lover of his country and its\r\nliberties with indignation.”[547] While at work on his Proclamation, he\r\nwrote Hamilton in New York, urging that public opinion assert itself in\r\nan unmistakable manner. “The crisis must be, and AS FAR AS MY\r\nCONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL POWERS AUTHORIZE, will be, met with energy and\r\nfirmness. HENCE THE PROPRIETY OF THE PUBLIC VOICE BEING HEARD;--AND IT\r\nOUGHT NOW TO BE SPOKEN IN A VOICE OF THUNDER.”[548] Thus, when the gavel\r\nfell on the opening of the Congress, Jackson had the situation well in\r\nhand, had perfected his plans for vigorous action within the limits of\r\nthe Constitution and the laws, but still hoped, through the pressure of\r\npublic opinion and the returning good sense of the Carolinians, it would\r\nbe unnecessary to resort to force.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nOn the opening day of the Congress the great Carolinian was not in his\r\nSenate seat, to which he had been immediately elected on his resignation\r\nfrom the Vice-Presidency, but public interest centered in it,\r\nnevertheless. The Jackson Message was awaited with keen anxiety. In its\r\nrecommendation of a reduction of the tariff was easily recognized a\r\nconciliatory gesture toward the South Carolinians. Even his discussion\r\nof the crisis was temperate and unprovocative. No one listening to the\r\nMessage could have had the slightest notion of what was taking place at\r\nthat very hour in Jackson’s workroom in the White House.\r\n\r\nEven before the Congress met, Edward Livingston was at work preparing\r\nthe Proclamation which was to thrill the country like a bugle blast,\r\nperpetuate the memory of Jackson, and reflect glory on himself. It was\r\nno mere accident which led to the selection of the Secretary of State\r\nfor this task. His views on the integrity and perpetuity of the Union\r\nwere intimately known to his chief; and it was a duty upon which\r\nLivingston could enter with all his heart. But the first draft of the\r\nProclamation was written by Jackson in a frenzy of composition, so\r\nhurriedly that he scattered the pages over the table to let them dry.\r\nThe general tenor of the document was therefore his. If the wording was\r\nLivingston’s, the document breathed the soul of Andrew Jackson. During\r\nthe period of its preparation, Jackson was in constant touch. He was\r\nthinking of nothing else. Thus, on the day his Message was read to\r\nCongress, the iron man was meditating his appeal to public opinion. It\r\nwas almost midnight. In his room in the southeast corner of the mansion,\r\nhe sat before the fireplace smoking his pipe--thinking. Bitter as he was\r\nagainst Calhoun and the leaders whom he felt had seduced the people of\r\nhis native State, he felt an affection for the confused masses who had\r\nbeen deluded; and, while prepared, if need be, to strike with the\r\nmilitary arm of the Government, he passionately hoped that this would\r\nnot become necessary. Going over to the table on which always stood the\r\npicture of his Rachel, and the Bible to which she had been devoted, he\r\nwrote a conclusion to the Proclamation in the nature of a touching\r\nappeal to the patriotic memories of the South Carolinians. Then he wrote\r\nto Livingston: “I submit the above as the conclusion of the Proclamation\r\nfor your amendment and revision. Let it receive your best flight of\r\neloquence, to strike to the heart, and speak to the feelings of my\r\ndeluded countrymen of South Carolina.”\r\n\r\nThree days later, the night again found Jackson obsessed with the\r\npreparation of the Proclamation. Livingston, in his writing, was sending\r\nit as he proceeded to the White House, where Major Donelson, the private\r\nsecretary, was engaged in copying it for the printer. At four o’clock in\r\nthe afternoon the Secretary of State had sent a number of sheets, and\r\nDonelson had finished copying and was waiting for more. Jackson was\r\nimpatient of the delay. The Message having gone forth, he thought it\r\nimportant that it should be followed immediately by the Proclamation for\r\nthe effect on South Carolina. Again he wrote to Livingston explaining\r\nthe reason for his anxiety. The Secretary would therefore please send\r\nover at once, “sealed, by the bearer,” such sheets as were completed,\r\nand the harassed Livingston complied. Under these conditions of pressure\r\nthe immortal document was written.[549]\r\n\r\nOn the day Jackson gave this Proclamation to the Nation he made his last\r\nappeal. A letter written to Poinsett that day discloses a determination\r\nto move sternly and unhesitatingly to what he conceived to be his solemn\r\nduty. This letter breathed the spirit of the battle-field. The act of\r\nthe Nullifiers was sheer treason. He had been assured that he would be\r\nsustained by Congress. “I will meet it [treason] at the threshold, and\r\nhave the leaders arrested and arraigned for treason,” he wrote. He was\r\nonly waiting for the Acts of the Legislature “to make a communication to\r\nCongress, ask the means necessary to carry my Proclamation into complete\r\neffect, and by an exemplary punishment of those leaders for treason so\r\nunprovoked, put down this rebellion, and strengthen our Government both\r\nat home and abroad.” The Unionists of South Carolina need not fear. In\r\nforty days he could have 50,000 men in the State, in forty more another\r\n50,000. “How impotent,” he wrote, “the threats of resistance with only a\r\npopulation of 250,000 whites, and nearly double that in blacks, with our\r\nships in the port to aid in the execution of the laws!”[550]\r\n\r\nThus hoping that necessity would not compel him to send armed forces,\r\ndetermined to meet the issue, however, as it might present itself,\r\ncareful to observe all the constitutional and legal limitations of his\r\npower, enraged to fury against the leaders and eager to lay his hands on\r\nCalhoun, he gave the country the Proclamation which instantly wiped out\r\nparty lines with most, and rallied the patriotic forces of the Union to\r\nhis support.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nAt the time of the writing of the Proclamation, Andrew Jackson was\r\nsixty-six, and Edward Livingston sixty-nine years old, but it breathes\r\nthe fire, the passion, the enthusiasm, and the eloquence of impetuous\r\nyouth. As an oration, it was to be treasured as a masterpiece; as a\r\npublic document, it has taken its place alongside the Emancipation\r\nProclamation as one of the greatest pronouncements of American history.\r\nIts publication appealed to the Unionists of the country like a charge\r\non the battle-field. To no one did it give keener pleasure than to\r\nWebster, who read it in New Jersey on his way to the capital. In\r\nPhiladelphia he met Clay, and a friend of the latter explained Clay’s\r\nplan of concessions to the Nullifiers through a new tariff of gradual\r\nreductions. The martial call of Jackson aroused the fighting blood\r\nwithin Webster, and Clay’s game of politics repelled him. He hastened to\r\nWashington determined to give his best blows for Jackson and the\r\nAdministration.[551]\r\n\r\nJohn Marshall, in gloomy mood, found in the Proclamation the elixir for\r\nhis pessimism.[552] Justice Story, despite his deep-seated prejudice,\r\ncould not withhold his commendation, coupled with an expression of\r\nstrange surprise. “The President’s Proclamation is excellent,” he wrote,\r\n“and contains the true principles of the Constitution; but will he stand\r\nto it? Will he not surrender all to the guidance of Virginia?”[553]\r\nAdams described it as a “blister plaster.”[554] Among all his long-time\r\npolitical opponents, Clay alone withheld enthusiastic commendation, with\r\nthe comment that, “although there are some good things in it, there are\r\nsome entirely too ultra for me.” In truth, the man who would “rather be\r\nright than President” seized eagerly upon the President’s patriotic\r\nposition to curry favor with the extreme State-Rights men of the South.\r\n\r\nThus we soon enter upon the party phase of the fight. The effect upon\r\nsome of Jackson’s State-Rights supporters was one of painful\r\nembarrassment. While the average Virginian had no sympathy with\r\nNullification, he subscribed to the State-Rights doctrine and to the\r\nright of secession. The very point on which Clay cunningly and\r\nunscrupulously pounced was therefore the one which caused the greatest\r\nconsternation among the Administration Democrats of the Old Dominion. It\r\nwas to them that Clay was making his appeal. The Virginia Assembly,\r\nwhich had just unanimously elected W. C. Rives, a Jacksonian, to the\r\nSenate, instantly reversed itself by electing John Tyler, an enemy, to\r\nthat body, to succeed Tazewell, who had resigned. W. S. Archer, writing\r\nto Cambreleng in New York, declared that it would be ridiculous to\r\nexpect Virginia to endorse the Proclamation,[555] and Governor Floyd,\r\nwho had received South Carolina’s vote in the recent election, rejoiced\r\nto find “the poor unworthy dogs, Ritchie, Van Buren & Co.\r\ndeserted.”[556] To the momentarily embarrassed Ritchie, his cleverness\r\npointed a way out. Penning a mild objection to some of the doctrinal\r\npoints, he accepted it as primarily a denunciation of Nullification,\r\nand, as such, gave it the support of his great prestige and pen.[557]\r\n\r\nSuch was the position of many others among the Southern leaders of the\r\nJackson party, but Ritchie found himself in a minority. John Tyler,\r\nnever friendly to Jackson, now seized upon the Proclamation as a\r\npretext for pushing to the head of the Opposition. Writing heatedly to\r\nTazewell of the “servility” to party of many Southern statesmen\r\nsupporting the President, he drew a gloomy picture of the future. The\r\nProclamation, he thought, had “swept away all the barriers of the\r\nConstitution,” had established “a consolidated military despotism.” He\r\n“trembled” for South Carolina. “The war cry is up--rely upon it,” he\r\nwrote. “The boast is that the President by stamping like another Pompey\r\non the earth can raise a hundred thousand men.”[558]\r\n\r\nIt is significant of Whig hopes, that, when Tyler wrote and Ritchie was\r\nsupporting the President, John Hampden Pleasants, the editor of the\r\n“Richmond Whig,” and an intimate of Clay’s, was denouncing the\r\nprinciples enunciated by Jackson and Livingston.[559] Resolutions were\r\nadopted by the Legislature denouncing both Nullification and the\r\nProclamation.\r\n\r\nNor was Jackson indifferent to the attitude Virginia might assume. He\r\nplanned to isolate South Carolina, and he feared an alliance with\r\nVirginia more than with any other State. Wishing to reach the Virginians\r\nas speedily as possible, he called upon Lewis Cass to prepare a letter\r\nin the form of an appeal to be published in Ritchie’s “Richmond\r\nEnquirer.” Within a few days after the appearance of the Proclamation,\r\nVirginians were reading a letter described by Ritchie as from “one of\r\nthe ablest men in the country.” Making no defense of the tariff, but\r\npointing out the impossibility of the radical changes demanded being\r\nmade within the limited time allowed by the Carolina politicians, he\r\nsuggested that “Virginia might interpose most efficaciously, and add\r\nanother leaf to the wreath which adorns her civic chaplet,” if her\r\nLegislature would appoint a committee to proceed to South Carolina and\r\n“entreat her convention ... to recall its late steps, and at all events\r\nto delay her final action till another trial is made to reduce the\r\ntariff.”[560] This was to lead, a little later, to the adoption of a\r\nsimilar plan.\r\n\r\nStrange as it may now seem, the position of Virginia prevented New York\r\nfrom endorsing the Proclamation unqualifiedly, through her\r\nLegislature--and thereon hangs a tale of the political cunning of Martin\r\nVan Buren. In the Empire State the Proclamation had been received with\r\nenthusiasm. Even so bitter a partisan as Philip Hone poured forth his\r\nadmiration and commendation on the pages of his diary. “As a\r\ncomposition, it is splendid,” he wrote, “and will take its place in the\r\narchives of our country, and dwell in the memory of our citizens\r\nalongside of the Farewell Address.... I think Jackson’s election may\r\nsave the Union. If he is sincere in his Proclamation, he will put down\r\nthis rebellion. Mr. Clay, pursuing the same measures, would not have\r\nbeen equally successful.”[561] We have seen, in Jackson’s letter to\r\nHamilton, his desire that every agency of publicity should be employed\r\nto focus the sentiment against Nullification. The New York Legislature\r\nbeing then in session, Hamilton wrote leading men in Albany urging the\r\npassage of a commendatory resolution. In the absence of definite\r\nencouragement, he then wrote Van Buren, his political and personal\r\nfriend, suggesting that he bring pressure to bear upon his friends in\r\nthe Assembly. The letter was returned, opened, but unanswered, and\r\nHamilton lost no time in writing of the incident to Jackson, with the\r\ncomment that “this unfriendly, nay offensive course, resulted from Van\r\nBuren’s fear of offending the dominant political party in\r\nVirginia.”[562]\r\n\r\nThat Van Buren was deeply embarrassed by the doctrinal features of the\r\nProclamation, if not by the possible effect upon his candidacy for the\r\nPresidency and his popularity among the Virginia politicians, has been\r\nadmitted and explained by himself.[563] The document was delivered to\r\nhim at the home of a friend in Albany as the party was in the act of\r\ngoing in to dinner. Instantly his practiced eye caught the phrasing that\r\nwould arouse the ire of the State-Rights element. The Whigs in Albany\r\nwere just as keen, and proceeded, with celerity, to take advantage.\r\nWilliam H. Seward immediately offered a resolution in the State Senate\r\nto the effect that “the President of the United States ... had advanced\r\nthe true principles upon which only the Constitution can be maintained\r\nand defended.” With Van Buren on the ground, and with the Democrats in\r\nthe majority, the Whigs hoped, not without reason, either to force the\r\nJacksonians to accept the conclusions of the resolution, or to a\r\nrejection of the endorsement, which would be interpreted as a rupture of\r\nthe relations of the President and Vice-President. The Democrats did\r\nneither--they postponed action. It was probably at this juncture that\r\nVan Buren received the letter from Hamilton and returned it unanswered.\r\nRealizing, however, the fatality of non-action, Van Buren prepared a\r\nresolution, together with an elaborate and laborious report, taking\r\nissue with “the history given by the President of the formation of our\r\nGovernment,” and calculated to satisfy the State-Rights men of Virginia.\r\nThese were adopted, and sent to the White House with an explanation.\r\nJust what Jackson thought of it will never be known, for he filed the\r\nletter without a word of comment to his secretary, in whose presence it\r\nwas read.[564] Nor was the subject ever mentioned in future\r\nconversations between the two leaders.[565] That a copy was also sent to\r\nRives and Ritchie in Virginia we may be sure.\r\n\r\nSuch were the cross-currents of party politics at the time, with Jackson\r\nplaying a bold and straight game, thinking solely of the Union, and Clay\r\nand Van Buren, rival candidates for the Presidency, pussyfooting and\r\nconciliating on a vital issue.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile what was the effect in South Carolina? Senator Hayne, now\r\nGovernor, met the challenge of the President in an able document, bitter\r\nin its defiance, which fired the fighting blood of the Nullifiers.\r\nPreston described it as “a document whose elegance of diction, elaborate\r\nand conclusive argument, just and clear constitutional exposition,\r\nconfuted all the show of argument of the President’s Proclamation.”[566]\r\nOutside of Nullification circles, the bitterness of this counterblast\r\nmade a deep impression. Adams found it “full of bitter words,” and,\r\nafter reading it, sent it to James K. Polk, the Jackson leader in the\r\nHouse.[567] The Hayne defiance was echoed by the Nullifiers. The\r\neloquent Preston, addressing a mass meeting in Charleston, declared that\r\n“there are 16,000 back countrymen with arms in their hands and cockades\r\nin their hats, ready to march to our city at a moment’s warning to\r\ndefend us.... I will pour down a torrent of volunteers that will sweep\r\nthe myrmidons of the tyrant from the soil of Carolina.”[568] But Calhoun\r\nwas disappointed with the Proclamation. He had hoped for an intemperate,\r\nranting denunciation of the Carolinians that would heat their blood and\r\nput them on the march. The sober dignity of the document and its\r\nimpressive appeal to the better natures of the people interfered with\r\nhis plans.\r\n\r\nIn the House of Representatives, the Carolinians were seething with\r\nwrath. The impassioned McDuffie, according to Adams, “could not contain\r\nhimself,” and declared that “if Congress should approve the principles\r\nof that proclamation, the liberties of the country were gone forever.”\r\nWhereupon Archer rose to suggest that a communication “would very\r\nshortly be received upon which the gentleman would have an opportunity\r\nto express his opinion without restraint.”[569]\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nThe excitement over the Proclamation found Calhoun remote from the\r\nturmoil and in the midst of his family at Fort Hill. There he lingered\r\nto enjoy the Christmas festivities, and the day following he started to\r\nWashington to take his place in the Senate. There was much drama in this\r\nwinter journey to the capital. One of his biographers has compared it to\r\n“that of Luther to attend the diet of Worms.”[570] The public was\r\nconvinced of the temper of Jackson and realized the possibilities when\r\nthe lion in him was aroused. To some Calhoun’s journey suggested a death\r\nmarch. Looked upon as the prime mover, the instigator, the leader of the\r\nseditious movement, many thought that he would be arrested on the charge\r\nof treason before he crossed the Virginia border. Interest in his\r\nprogress was intense, and even among those who abhorred the new doctrine\r\nthere was no little sympathy for the grim, impeccably pure statesman who\r\nhad the courage to beard the lion in his den. New Year’s Day found him\r\nat Raleigh, where he rested. Here crowds gathered to welcome, or merely\r\nto observe him, and a public dinner was offered him by his admirers.\r\nThis he politely declined. There was something of grandeur in the\r\ndignity of his demeanor. As he proceeded from town to town, his approach\r\nwas announced and elaborate preparations were made for his reception,\r\nfor both North Carolina and Virginia were devoted to State Rights, and\r\nnot a few of their citizens sympathized with the Carolina doctrine, and\r\nlooked upon secession as an inevitable result of the crisis. Unlike the\r\ncase of Burr, nothing personally sinister clung to him. His worst\r\nenemies conceded his honesty, and this was in his favor. Mrs. Bayard\r\nSmith, echoing the sentiment of the Washington drawing-rooms, found\r\nherself wondering, on Christmas Day, if all the “high soarings” of “one\r\nof the noblest and most generous spirits” were to end “in\r\ndisappointment or humiliation or in blood.”[571] That this friendly\r\natmosphere, through which he moved, was reassuring to Calhoun, we may\r\nassume from his letter to his son on reaching the capital. Here he found\r\n“things better than anticipated” and that it was beginning to be “felt\r\nthat we must succeed.”\r\n\r\nOn the day he took the oath and his seat in the Senate, the little\r\nsemi-circular chamber was crowded with friends and foes, drawn by the\r\ndramatic features of the situation. Tall, erect, his face sternly set,\r\nhis iron-gray hair brushed back, he walked into the chamber over which\r\nhe had presided, slowly and with a deliberation which seemed as studied\r\nas that of an actor upon the stage. When he took his seat, some Senators\r\nhastened to clasp his hand, but it was noticed that others, who had\r\nformerly been friendly, held back, deterred perhaps by the frown of the\r\nWhite House. At length the great scene--the taking of the oath. This he\r\ndid in a reverential manner, and his voice was serious and solemn when\r\nhe swore to support the Constitution which Jackson contended he had\r\nflagrantly violated.[572] The leader of Nullification was in his seat.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nThe day after Calhoun started on his journey to the capital, the\r\nVerplanck Tariff Bill, sanctioned by the Administration, was introduced\r\nin the House. This measure, it was thought, might go a long way toward\r\npreventing any accession to the ranks of the Nullifiers in that it went\r\nfar toward meeting the objections to the revenue laws. It was a rather\r\nradical measure, providing for the immediate reduction of numerous\r\nduties, with further reductions a year later. The protection forces\r\nrallied at once for its defeat. Through all the parliamentary devices of\r\ndelay, Jackson, keenly watching developments through the reports of\r\nLewis and Donelson, was convinced that the Nullifiers were as much\r\ninterested in its defeat as the protectionists. An “insulting and\r\nirritating speech” of Wilde of Georgia he thought “instigated by the\r\nNullies, who wish no accommodation of the tariff.”[573] Long before it\r\ncould be brought to a vote, it had been hammered beyond recognition by\r\namendments and Jackson had lost interest in the reduction of the tariff,\r\nrather preferring first to whip Nullification without any preliminary\r\nconcessions.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Jackson was awaiting developments before submitting his\r\nMessage to Congress asking additional powers to put down the heresy.\r\nThrough the latter part of December and the early part of January, Hayne\r\nwas making open preparations for an armed resistance. Poinsett,\r\nreporting constantly, had abandoned hope of “putting down Nullification\r\nby moral force,” and hoped that the “vain blustering of these mad-men”\r\nwould not influence Congress on the tariff, as “such a concession would\r\nconfirm the power and popularity of the Nullifiers.”[574] He was anxious\r\nfor the contest. “Is not raising, embodying, and marching men to oppose\r\nthe laws of the United States an overt act of treason?” he wrote the\r\nUnionist Congressman from Charleston, who still hoped that the crisis\r\ncould be passed without recourse to the Federal army.[575] Thus, early\r\nin January, Poinsett was anxious to have Federal troops sent into the\r\nState, while other Unionists still held back. In this controversy\r\nJackson agreed with the conservatives that the Unionists of the State\r\nshould first have an opportunity to demonstrate their ability to handle\r\nthe situation.\r\n\r\nOn January 16th, Archer’s promise to McDuffie was fulfilled, when\r\nJackson laid all the facts relative to the crisis before Congress with a\r\nrequest for authority to abolish or alter certain ports of entry, and to\r\nuse the army to protect the officers in the discharge of their duties.\r\nHe also asked for the revival of the sixth section of the Act of March\r\n3, 1815, and for a provision for the removal to the United States\r\nCircuit Court, without copy of the record, of any suit brought in the\r\nState courts against any individual for an act performed under the laws\r\nof the United States. A grim touch was added in the request for\r\nauthorization for marshals to make provision for keeping prisoners.\r\n\r\nVery late on the night of the day the Message was submitted, Jackson,\r\nworn out and wretched from a bad cold, sat in his room writing to\r\nPoinsett. The Message had been read. Calhoun, “agitated and confused,”\r\nhad “let off a little of his ire” against the President, and John\r\nForsyth had replied “with great dignity and firmness.” That night it\r\nseemed to Jackson that Calhoun had been placed “between Scylla and\r\nCharybdis,” and was “reckless.” The uncertainty of negotiations had\r\npassed, and the hour for action--the happy hour for Jackson--had struck.\r\nThe conferences with Drayton were over. Poinsett, at the front, was now\r\nthe man of the hour. The moment the Nullifiers were “in hostile array,”\r\nthis fact was to be certified to Jackson by the attorney for the\r\ndistrict, or the judge, and he would “forthwith order the leaders\r\narrested and prosecuted.” And he added in his note to Poinsett: “We will\r\nstrike at the head and demolish the monster Nullification and secession\r\nat the threshold by the power of the law.”[576]\r\n\r\nThus, that night, the fingers of Andrew Jackson were itching for the\r\nthroat of John C. Calhoun.\r\n\r\nFive days later, Senator Wilkins, of the Judiciary Committee, presented\r\nthe famous “Force Bill,” and one of the most violent debates in history\r\nbegan. On the following day, Calhoun submitted a set of resolutions\r\nsetting forth his views of the constitutional question involved, in the\r\nhope of thereby directing the debate into that channel. But the Senate\r\nwas in no temper for such a discussion and pushed forward to the debate\r\non the main and pressing question. The Calhoun resolutions were speedily\r\ntabled. Wilkins led off in the debate, and others followed, one on the\r\nheels of the other, until at length John Tyler took the floor to deliver\r\nthe speech which, after that of Calhoun, was the most forceful attack to\r\nbe made upon the measure. Reading his speech to-day one wonders how the\r\nRepublic outlived the Jackson Administrations. Dire calamity was\r\npredicted as a result of his every action. He saw Carolinians again\r\ndriven “into the morasses where Marion and Sumter found refuge,” with\r\ntheir cities and towns leveled to the dust, and their daughters clothed\r\nin mourning, with “helpless orphans” made of their “rising sons.” But,\r\nhe continued, “I will not despair. Rome had her Curtius, Sparta her\r\nLeonidas, and Athens her band of devoted patriots; and shall it be said\r\nthat the American Senate contains not one man who will step forward to\r\nrescue his country in this, her moment of peril? Although that man may\r\nnever wear an earthly crown or sway an earthly scepter, eternal fame\r\nshall weave an evergreen around his brow, and his name shall rank with\r\nthe proudest patriots of the proudest climes.”\r\n\r\nWith the closing sentence, Tyler turned significantly to Henry Clay, who\r\nsat an interested spectator. Throughout this memorable debate he was to\r\nremain mute. The great orator and party leader was making sympathetic\r\ngestures to the extreme State-Rights men of the South. Even at this\r\ntime, and knowing Tyler’s views, he was writing to his friend, Francis\r\nBrooke: “Will he [Tyler] be reëlected? We feel here some solicitude on\r\nthat point, being convinced that under all circumstances, he would be\r\nfar preferable to any person that could be sent.”[577] And such was his\r\npartisan hate of Jackson that the second leader of the party Opposition,\r\nJohn M. Clayton, in speaking in support of the Force Bill, could not\r\nrefrain from an exhibition of boorishness and bigotry in coupling his\r\nadvocacy of the Jackson measure with a sneer at Jackson.\r\n\r\n“My support of the measure,” he said, “is predicated on no servile\r\nsubmission to any Executive mandate, on no implicit and unlimited faith\r\nin any man.... I will not be deterred from the adoption of this measure\r\nby any consideration of the source from which it has emanated.”\r\n\r\nThus did Clayton contribute to the pleasure of the Nullifiers by the\r\ndenunciation of the man who stood in their way, and in sneering at those\r\nSouthern Democrats who stood squarely behind Jackson despite the gibes\r\nof the Calhoun followers that they were yielding a servile submission.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Jackson’s supporters were giving the measure their undivided\r\nsupport, and none of them more heartily, and none so ably, as Senators\r\nfrom the South. Senator Felix Grundy of Tennessee, able lawyer, seasoned\r\nstatesman, resourceful parliamentarian, took charge of the fight on the\r\nfloor. Rives of Virginia, learned constitutional lawyer, scholarly,\r\npolished, heroically sacrificed a seat in the Senate to stand by the\r\nUnion. And Forsyth of Georgia, “the greatest debater of his time,”\r\naffected to look upon the Nullification doctrine as “the double\r\ndistilled essence of nonsense.”\r\n\r\nAs the fight developed and the certainty of defeat grew upon the\r\nNullifiers, efforts were made to gain time, with the Administration\r\nforces pressing for action. Senator Willie Mangum of North Carolina,\r\nbrilliant, and sacrificing a great career to drink, on securing the\r\nfloor asked for an adjournment on the ground of indisposition.\r\nOrdinarily the request would have been granted. But Forsyth, Grundy, and\r\nWilkins were instantly on their feet with objections. Calhoun, pointing\r\nout that Mangum was the only member of the Judiciary Committee opposed\r\nto the bill, begged that he be given an opportunity to explain his\r\nposition, only to be told, none too graciously, by Wilkins, that he had\r\nno doubt of Mangum’s capacity to speak then. When Calhoun reminded him\r\nof Mangum’s plea of indisposition, he was ignored. At this juncture,\r\nWebster, who had been silent, suggested that Mangum could easily speak\r\non another day and the debate proceed. Whereupon Senator King of Alabama\r\nmade a transparent effort to draw Webster’s speech at once. The New\r\nEngland orator significantly replied that “the gentleman from\r\nMassachusetts fully understands the gentleman from Alabama; but he has\r\nno disposition to address the Senate at present, nor, under existing\r\ncircumstances, at any other time, on the subject of this bill.” This was\r\ntaken as indicating Webster’s conviction that up to that time the\r\nadvocates of the bill needed no reënforcements, and that he would\r\nreserve himself for Calhoun.\r\n\r\nIt was during these proceedings that an exchange occurred between\r\nPoindexter and Grundy which illustrates the hair-trigger conditions in\r\nCarolina. A rumor had just spread through the chamber that Jackson had\r\nordered a portion of the fleet to occupy Charleston Harbor, and had sent\r\ninstructions to the military commander in Charleston, and Poindexter\r\nimmediately offered a resolution calling upon the President for\r\ninformation as to his actions and intentions. Grundy calmly, if\r\nprovokingly, suggested that perhaps some very respectable gentlemen of\r\nCharleston had furnished the President with information on which the\r\nsecret orders had been issued, and that Poindexter would surely not ask\r\nthe names of the gentlemen and all the circumstances of the disclosure.\r\n\r\n“All--all--the whole of them!” cried Poindexter.\r\n\r\n“But would not such disclosures lead to the immediate shedding of\r\nblood?” Grundy inquired.\r\n\r\n“I care not if it does!” shouted the excited Mississippian. “Let us have\r\nthe information no matter what the circumstances!”\r\n\r\nGrundy smilingly took his seat.\r\n\r\nThus the debate dragged on--the two greatest figures still silent.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, as the debate proceeded, Jackson was watching South Carolina\r\nand making all his preparations. On January 24th, he wrote Poinsett that\r\nthe Force Bill debate was about to begin, that he had done his duty, and\r\nif Congress failed to act, and he should be informed of the assemblage\r\nof an armed force, he stood ready for drastic measures.[578] There is\r\nsomething of the heroic mingled with pathos in the picture this letter\r\npresents of Jackson at this time. It was late at night. The House sat\r\nlate. He had not heard since seven o’clock. “My eyes grow dim.”\r\n\r\nTwo hours later he ordered General Scott to Charleston to repel by force\r\nany attempt to seize the forts.[579] Holding his rage in check,\r\nmeasuring every step by his constitutional and legal powers, determined\r\nto do nothing rashly to precipitate bloodshed, Jackson held himself in\r\nreadiness, as the debate on the Force Bill proceeded, to meet any\r\neventuality that might arise.[580] But Jackson and the Administration\r\nwere not at all satisfied with the progress of the debate. None of the\r\ntrio of genius, Clay, Webster, and Calhoun, had yet participated. It\r\nwould be too much to expect that Clay would speak on behalf of any\r\nJackson measure, and it was certain that Calhoun would deliver one of\r\nhis characteristically powerful arguments against the bill. There was\r\njust one man strong enough to meet the impact of that argument, and that\r\nwas Webster. It was a reasonable hope that he would prominently support\r\nthe measure involving the principles he had made his own. Among his\r\nintimates, such as Story, it was expected that he would enter at the\r\npsychological moment, but the great orator kept his own counsels, and\r\nduring the early part of the debate was absent from the Senate Chamber\r\non other engagements. As Calhoun prepared his heavy artillery for\r\naction, the apprehension of Jackson and his supporters increased, and\r\nevery effort was made, at first through Webster’s friends, to learn his\r\nintentions.[581] Then, one day, a carriage halted before the lodgings of\r\nWebster, and the tall figure of Livingston emerged and entered the\r\nhouse. It was not a half-hearted welcome to the Administration camp that\r\nthe Secretary of State offered. On the contrary, Webster was earnestly\r\nimportuned to take the lead on the floor, and to frame any amendments he\r\nthought necessary.[582] If such importunity was unnecessary, it was none\r\nthe less pleasing to the vanity of the orator, and Livingston was able\r\nto carry back to the White House the assurance that when Calhoun spoke\r\nhe would be answered by Webster. On the 11th of February, Webster was\r\nready and waiting.[583] Four days later, abandoning the hope that\r\nWebster might speak first, Calhoun began one of the most powerful\r\nspeeches of his career. The Senate Chamber and the galleries were\r\npacked.\r\n\r\nAs the tall, gaunt figure, with slightly stooped shoulders, rose, the\r\nsolemnity of his mien and manner, the fire in the wonderful eyes that\r\n“watched everything and revealed nothing,” suggested, to some, the\r\nconspirator with his back against the wall, to others the austere\r\npatriot battling for the liberties of his country.[584] We need not\r\nconcern ourselves with the general tenor of his remarkable argument--a\r\nreiteration and reënforcement of his constitutional views. But the\r\ngeneral spirit of resentment, the passionate hate of Jackson, the\r\ndefiance, constitute dramatic features that assist in the sensing of the\r\natmosphere in which the mighty battle was waged. Almost in the\r\nbeginning, in defending his support of the tariff of 1816, and\r\nexplaining that he had spoken at the instance of Ingham, the late\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, this spirit flared in an amazing tribute to\r\nthat mediocre and unscrupulous politician, and an indirect attack upon\r\nJackson for dismissing him. As he proceeded, he startled the Senate now\r\nand then by the injection of personalities. Here a contemptuous fling at\r\nVan Buren, there a hint at Mrs. Eaton, and everywhere references to\r\ncontemplated “war” and “massacres” and “savages.” “I proclaim it,” he\r\nsolemnly declared, “that should this bill pass, and attempt be made to\r\nenforce it, it will be resisted at every hazard--even that of death\r\nitself.” It was two o’clock on the second day of the speech that Calhoun\r\nconcluded, with a warning to Southern Senators that should the bill be\r\nenacted all of them would be excluded from the emoluments of the\r\nGovernment, “which will be reserved for those only who have qualified\r\nthemselves, by political prostitution, for admission into the Magdalen\r\nAsylum.”\r\n\r\nThe moment he sank into his seat, Daniel Webster rose.\r\n\r\nThe relations between Webster and the Administration leaders after the\r\nvisit of Livingston had been intimate and confidential, and the orator\r\nhad availed himself of the invitation to make desirable amendments. One\r\nstormy day during this period, the great opponent of the Democratic\r\nParty might have been seen rolling up to the Capitol in the White House\r\ncarriage. On the floor, when he rose, were many of the Administration\r\nleaders, including Lewis, ready to hasten the news of the speech and its\r\nreception to the White House, where Jackson was anxiously, but\r\nconfidently, waiting. It was late in the evening when the orator\r\nconcluded his masterful argument on the proposition that “the\r\nConstitution is not a compact between sovereign States.” Brushing aside\r\nthe personalities, scarcely referring to any speech made during the\r\ndebate, he took the resolutions Calhoun had submitted as embodying his\r\nviews, and based his argument upon these. Speaking with his accustomed\r\ngravity, with more than his usual earnestness, without passion or\r\npersonal feeling, he took up the sophistries of the Nullification school\r\nand crushed them, one by one. Nullification was revolution, and success\r\nmeant the destruction of the Republic, chaos, the end of American\r\nliberty. To prevent these evils was the duty of the National authority;\r\nand the Force Bill was necessary for their prevention.\r\n\r\nLong before he closed, the lights had been lit in the little Senate\r\nChamber where the crowd was densely packed. With his conclusion the\r\ngalleries rose and cheered, and Poindexter, outraged at the exhibition\r\nof feeling, indignantly demanded an immediate adjournment. The great\r\nword had been spoken in the Senate--the Proclamation reiterated on the\r\nfloor. No one was more delighted with Webster’s triumph than Jackson.\r\n“Mr. Webster replied to Mr. Calhoun yesterday,” he wrote Poinsett, “and,\r\nit is said, demolished him. It is believed by more than one that Mr.\r\nCalhoun is in a state of dementation--his speech was a perfect failure;\r\nand Mr. Webster handled him as a child.”[585]\r\n\r\nThus Webster entered upon more intimate relations with the White House,\r\nwith Jackson personally thanking him for a great public service, and\r\nLivingston reiterating expressions of appreciation. The Jackson\r\nSenators, Isaac Hill excepted, joined in the assiduous cultivation of\r\nthe orator, and he was invited to strike from a list of applicants for\r\noffice the names of all displeasing to himself. Such was the enthusiasm\r\nof the President that overtures were unquestionably made to Webster, as\r\nset forth by Benton,[586] to gain his adherence to the Administration.\r\nIt was a crisis in his life and in the politics of the Nation. He was\r\nthen closer to Jackson’s views on vital matters than to those of either\r\nClay or Calhoun. His antipathy to the latter’s doctrines was as\r\npronounced as that of Jackson; and he had no respect for Clay’s play to\r\nthe seditious with his compromise tariff. His ideas were not remote\r\nfrom those of Livingston. Had he then broken with his old co-workers,\r\nand allied himself with the dominant party, he would have been advanced\r\nimmeasurably toward the Presidency. Senator Lodge admits[587] that there\r\nwas much truth in Benton’s theory, but reasonably holds that the\r\ncoalition would have been wrecked by the inevitable clashing of the\r\nconflicting temperaments.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, with the debate dwindling to an anti-climax, Calhoun and his\r\nfriends were not nearly so indifferent to war as they pretended. It was\r\ngenerally understood that Jackson was ready and eager to strike the\r\nmoment an overt act was committed. With Hayne urging caution, some\r\nirresponsible hothead might at any moment hasten the crisis. Then, all\r\nknew, Jackson would place South Carolina under martial law, arrest\r\nCalhoun for treason, and turn him over to the courts for trial. Some of\r\nthe latter’s friends began to interest themselves in a compromise tariff\r\nthat would open a door of escape. The Whig protectionists, the\r\nNullifiers, and the Bank were rapidly rushing together to make common\r\ncause against Jackson. Under Clay’s leadership at the beginning of the\r\nsession these elements united in electing Duff Green, of the\r\n“Telegraph,” printer to the Senate, and Gales, of the “Intelligencer,”\r\nto the House. Thus, through Clay, the Nullification organ secured a new\r\nlease of life, and flooded the South with circularized appeals for\r\nsupport. “If the people of the South deserve to be free they will not\r\npermit this press to go down,” Green wrote--and this was known to Clay.\r\nThe Bank party looked on approvingly, with John Sargeant writing\r\nenthusiastically to Biddle of the new political alignments. “The new\r\nstate of parties,” he wrote, “will be founded upon a combination of the\r\nSouth, and the leaders of it are friends of the Bank upon principle,\r\nand will be more so from opposition to Jackson.”[588] With this\r\nalignment in mind, John M. Clayton cynically observed to Clay that\r\n“these South Carolinians are acting very badly, but they are good\r\nfellows, and it would be a pity to let Jackson hang them.”[589] When\r\nRepresentative Letcher of Kentucky, a boisterous partisan of Clay’s,\r\nsuggested the compromise plan to his chief, he “received it at first\r\ncoolly and doubtfully.”[590] Afterwards Clay reconsidered and broached\r\nthe subject to Webster, who, holding the Jackson view, replied that “it\r\nwould be yielding great principles to faction; that the time had come to\r\ntest the strength of the Constitution and the Government.”[591]\r\nThereafter Webster was not included in the consultations.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the true story of the compromise tariff of 1833 will never be\r\nknown. One version credits the initiative to Clayton in calling a\r\nmeeting of men primarily interested in the tariff, and only incidentally\r\nin the Nullification crisis, consisting of but half the New England\r\nSenators, and the two from Delaware, with Clay, Webster, and Calhoun all\r\nabsent.[592] Many years later John Tyler accepted the responsibility.\r\nAccording to his version he “waited on Mr. Clay.” They “conversed about\r\nthe times.” Clay “saw the danger.” Tyler “appealed to his patriotism,”\r\nand “no man appealed so in vain.” The Virginian referred Clay “to\r\nanother man as the only one necessary to consult, and that man was John\r\nC. Calhoun.” It would not only be necessary for Clay to “satisfy his own\r\nparty,” but to “reconcile an opposite party by large concessions.” Thus\r\nClay and Calhoun “met, consulted and agreed.”[593] This differs in some\r\nparticulars from the Benton version.[594] Here we have it that Clay\r\nprepared his measure and sent it to Calhoun by Letcher, as the two\r\nnegotiators were not, at the time, on speaking terms. Finding some\r\nobjectionable features which he thought a personal interview would\r\npersuade the author to eliminate, Calhoun asked Letcher to arrange a\r\nconference, which was held in Clay’s room. The meeting was “cold and\r\ndistant.” Clay rose, bowed, and asked Calhoun to be seated, and, to\r\nrelieve the embarrassment, Letcher took his departure. Clay refused to\r\nyield.\r\n\r\nThe story here enters into the melodramatic although there is nothing\r\nimpossible about it. Letcher, in another conference, this time with\r\nJackson, found the grim old warrior hard set against any sort of a\r\ncompromise, unwilling to discuss one, and determined to enforce the\r\nlaws. The Kentuckian related the conversation to McDuffie; he to\r\nCalhoun. A little later Letcher was awakened from a sound sleep by\r\nSenator Johnston of Louisiana, an intimate friend of Clay, with the\r\nstartling story that he had heard authoritatively that Jackson would\r\nadmit of no further delay, and was preparing to arrest Calhoun for\r\ntreason. It was agreed that the Carolinian should be immediately\r\nnotified, and in the darkness of the night Letcher hastened to Calhoun’s\r\nlodgings. As the gaunt statesman sat up in bed, the Johnston story was\r\ntold him and “he was evidently disturbed.”[595] That some such incident\r\noccurred is corroborated by Perley Poore,[596] who was an observer of\r\nevents in the Washington of that day. Here we have some embellishments.\r\nCalhoun had heard some threats and had sent Letcher to Jackson to\r\nascertain his intentions. The old man’s eyes had been “lighted by an\r\nunwonted fire,” and he had told the emissary that with the first overt\r\nact, he would try Calhoun for treason and “hang him high as Haman.”\r\nThereupon Letcher made all haste to Calhoun, who received him sitting up\r\nin bed, with a cloak thrown around him. “There sat Calhoun,” wrote\r\nPerley Poore, “drinking in eagerly every word, and, as Letcher\r\nproceeded, he turned pale as death, and great as he was in intellect,\r\ntrembled like an aspen leaf, not from fear or cowardice, but from\r\nconsciousness of guilt.”[597] Here we detect the professional journalist\r\ndrawing perhaps on his imagination to dramatize the picture.\r\n\r\nHowever, Calhoun, convinced of Jackson’s grim determination, was ready\r\nto welcome a way out short of conflict or utter humiliation, and at the\r\nsame time Clay and Clayton were not happy over the situation. The\r\nprotective system had brought the country to the very verge of\r\ndisintegration. With Nullification crushed by force, conservative public\r\nopinion might demand a complete reversal of the revenue policy and\r\ndestroy the “American System.” That Clay at this time was thinking\r\nprimarily of the preservation of his protective system, and secondarily\r\nof currying favor with the extreme State-Rights party, including the\r\nNullifiers, is plainly disclosed in the record. Thus the proposed\r\ncombination of the Nullifiers and the protectionists to stay the arm of\r\nJackson. In this combination no one was more prominent than John M.\r\nClayton, the brilliant and bibulous, who frankly cared less about saving\r\nthe Union than of saving the tariff, and who would “pause long before he\r\nsurrendered it [the tariff] even to save the Union.”[598] He was to\r\nprove himself as good as his word a little later.\r\n\r\nThus, in the midst of the discussion of the Force Bill, Clay, Calhoun,\r\nClayton, Letcher, and Tyler were in constant communication on the\r\ncompromise tariff. Webster was utterly ignored, as was Jackson, these\r\ntwo refusing to “compromise a principle” in any such fashion.[599] The\r\nfact that Clay and Calhoun had reached a general agreement was soon\r\nknown, and it was accepted as an offensive and defensive alliance\r\nagainst Jackson. “They are partners in a contra dance,” wrote Blair in\r\nthe “Globe.” “For some time they turned their backs on each other. They\r\nwill make a match of it. In plain English, we have a new\r\ncoalition.”[600]\r\n\r\nIn due time the bill was introduced by Clay, much to the delight of\r\nTyler. “I recall the enthusiasm I felt that day,” said Tyler, almost\r\nthirty years afterwards. “We advanced to meet each other, and grasped\r\neach other’s hands, midway of the chamber.”[601] This measure, differing\r\nfrom Clay’s original plan, provided that for all articles paying more\r\nthan twenty per cent duty, the surplus above that rate should be\r\ngradually reduced, until in 1842 all should disappear. The manufacturers\r\nas usual had been summoned and consulted. At first dismayed and\r\noutraged, they soon realized that it was to their interest to fall into\r\nline. Certain features had been voted down in committee, but here\r\nClayton asserted himself. He announced that these would be introduced as\r\namendments on the floor, and that unless every Nullifier voted for them\r\nall, he would kill the bill himself by making the motion to table it.\r\nThe most objectionable of these, to Calhoun, was that on home valuation.\r\n\r\nSuch was the situation when Clay presented the bill on February 12th,\r\nthree days before Calhoun rose to speak on the Force Bill. Webster and\r\nAdams, thoroughly disgusted, at once announced their opposition, and\r\nJackson could not restrain his contempt for the unholy alliance, which\r\nwas almost immediately to become a triple alliance with the Bank as the\r\nthird party. “I have no doubt,” the President wrote Hamilton, “the\r\npeople will duly appreciate the motive which led to it.”[602]\r\n\r\nIn presenting the measure, Clay made no secret of his purpose. “I\r\nbelieve the American System to be in the greatest danger,” he said, “and\r\nI believe that it can be placed on a better and a safer foundation at\r\nthis session than next.” Webster, however, was not impressed. “This may\r\nbe so, sir,” he replied. “This may be so. But, if it be so, it is\r\nbecause the American people will not sanction the tariff; and if they\r\nwill not, then, sir, it cannot be sustained at all.” Calhoun heartily\r\napproved the object of the bill. “He who loves the Union,” he said,\r\n“must desire to see this agitating question brought to a termination.”\r\nJohn Forsyth, representing the Administration, objected to the\r\nintroduction of the bill fourteen days before the expiration of the\r\nCongress. Would it not be better to await the action of the House on the\r\nbill before it--the Verplanck Bill? And he objected, properly, on the\r\nground that all revenue measures had to originate in the House. This\r\nconstitutional objection, raised by Forsyth, was met on February 25th\r\njust as the House was about to adjourn for dinner, when the ever handy\r\nLetcher arose and moved the substitution of the Clay bill for the one\r\nthen pending. The motion was carried and the bill passed the lower\r\nbranch of Congress.[603]\r\n\r\nThus the two measures, the Force Bill and the compromise tariff, were\r\npending in the Senate at the same time, with Clay making every effort,\r\nbut without avail, to pass his measure first.\r\n\r\nOn February 24th the Force Bill was called up for final action. With the\r\nbeginning of the calling of the roll, all the enemies of the measure,\r\nwith the single exception of John Tyler, arose and filed from the Senate\r\nChamber. Taken by surprise at such conduct, Tyler immediately moved an\r\nadjournment. Wilkins called attention to the fact that Calhoun and his\r\nfollowers had just that moment withdrawn, and the motion was defeated.\r\nThe roll-call proceeded--and only the name of John Tyler appears on the\r\nlist of the negatives. Such was always the courage of this\r\nmuch-belittled man--a courage which we shall meet again.[604] Five days\r\nlater the tariff bill was called up, and Clayton offered his amendments\r\nwhich were so offensive to Calhoun and his followers, repeating his\r\nthreat to kill the bill if Calhoun and all the Nullifiers did not vote\r\nfor every amendment. Clay and Calhoun consulted, and Clayton was\r\nimportuned to yield, but the stubborn protectionist was adamant. Thus\r\nconfronted, Clay and Calhoun accepted the amendments, and, as Clayton\r\npresented them, voted for them, one by one, until the last and most\r\ndistasteful, on home valuation, was reached.\r\n\r\nHere the friends of Calhoun balked, and Clayton, never given to idle\r\nbluster, immediately made his motion to table the bill. Clay implored,\r\nand Clayton set his jaws and shook his head. The measure seemed doomed.\r\nMeanwhile, the Nullifiers, greatly alarmed, withdrew to the space behind\r\nthe Vice-President’s chair for consultation. Finally Clayton was\r\nrequested to withdraw his motion to give Calhoun and his friends time\r\nfor consideration. With the understanding that, unless the votes were\r\nforthcoming, the motion would be renewed, the request was granted, and\r\nthe Senate adjourned for the night.\r\n\r\nThe morning found Clayton confronted with a plan devised during the\r\nnight to spare Calhoun the humiliation of voting for the hated\r\namendment, provided enough votes were assured to carry it through\r\nwithout his vote. The immovable Clayton sternly shook his head. Calhoun\r\nmust vote for every amendment and for the bill. When the Senate\r\nconvened, it was still uncertain what the Carolinian would do. At\r\nlength, after all of his friends had first stated their objections, and\r\nyet reluctantly yielded, Calhoun arose, repeated the performance, and,\r\nhaving voted for the amendment at the dictation of Clayton, voted for\r\nthe bill.[605] The unhappy plight of Calhoun was not lost upon his\r\nenemies, and Blair found in it an inspiration for his sarcasm. “A single\r\nnight,” he wrote, “was sufficient to change the settled opinion of the\r\nprofound reader of the Constitution. We exceedingly doubt whether in the\r\nprivate interview in which Mr. Clay disposed of Mr. Calhoun’s\r\nconstitutional scruples, a word was uttered in relation to the\r\nConstitution.”[606] Thus passed into law, under circumstances deserving\r\nof Benton’s reprehension, the measure concocted by a combination of\r\nerstwhile foes.[607] The Nullifiers died hard, and Duff Green, the pen\r\nof Nullification, made printer to the Senate by this incongruous\r\ncombination, in performing the hateful official duty of publishing the\r\nForce Bill in the “Telegraph,” had the impudence to dress his paper in\r\nmourning. “This is the way,” observed a Jacksonian paper, “this\r\nungrateful wretch shows his gratitude to the Senate for his recent\r\nappointment.”[608]\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, what of South Carolina?\r\n\r\nThe letter of Cass, published in the “Richmond Enquirer,” had borne\r\nfruit, and Virginia had sent Benjamin Watkins Leigh, a lawyer of\r\ndistinction and an orator of no mean ability, to Charleston to ask a\r\nsuspension of the Nullification Ordinance until Congress had adjourned.\r\nAn ardent devotee of State Rights, now a bitter enemy of Jackson, and\r\nsoon to enter the Senate to make his opposition felt, he had much in his\r\nprinciples and personality to command a respectful hearing from South\r\nCarolina. The call of the Nullification Convention was consequently\r\npostponed until after the adjournment of Congress, and March 11th was\r\nfixed as the day for reassembling. By that time it was all over--the\r\nForce Bill in effect. The convention met at Columbia, with Hayne in the\r\nchair. Leigh was invited within the bar. The dominating figure of the\r\nscene, however, was Calhoun, who had gone post-haste to Carolina to urge\r\nthe acceptance of the compromise. The tall, thin figure of the great\r\nSenator, seated among the delegates on the floor, was the star of the\r\nassembly. A committee was named to consider the general course of\r\naction; and one week later the Ordinance of Nullification was rescinded,\r\nand by a vote of 153 to 4 the convention agreed that the threatened\r\ndanger was over.\r\n\r\nThe political effect of the fight was to be felt throughout the period\r\nof the generation then living. The Secessionists and Nullifiers paraded,\r\nwith much flapping of banners, out of the Democratic Party, to be\r\njoyously and effusively welcomed by Henry Clay into the Opposition.\r\nDuring the remainder of Jackson’s Administration, the most bitter and\r\npersistent of his foes were to be men, once Democrats, who had left the\r\nparty because Jackson was prepared to preserve the Union with the sword.\r\nCalhoun and Preston, McDuffie and Poindexter, Leigh and Tyler--these\r\nwere to crowd Clay for the leadership of the party that now prepared to\r\nenter the lists against Jackson and his Administration, flying the flag,\r\nand posing as the real friends of the Republic and the Constitution. If\r\nthey had been free with their characterizations of Jackson during the\r\nNullification fight as “tyrant,” “despot,” “autocrat,” they were to use\r\nthe epithets more frequently in opposing him upon the Bank. If during\r\nthis latter struggle they were to speak with almost convincing eloquence\r\nof the destruction of free institutions, they had learned the language\r\nwhen calling upon the people to defend their liberties against the\r\nauthor of the Nullification Proclamation. Out of this alliance, for\r\nwhich Clay had so cunningly planned, was to come a party to oppose the\r\nDemocratic Party with indifferent success for twenty-two years; and,\r\nstrangely enough, the only one of its leaders to become a beneficiary of\r\nthe unholy alliance was John Tyler, who was to reach the White House.\r\nPoinsett, after the Nullification fight, retired to his rice plantation,\r\nwhere he lived with his books and enjoying the society of cultivated men\r\nand women, until called by Van Buren to enter his Cabinet. Serving\r\nthroughout the Administration, he returned, at the expiration of his\r\nterm, to his plantation, where he died ten years before the attack on\r\nSumter.\r\n\r\nThe passage of the two important measures was not, however, to end the\r\ndrama of the session--one of the most dramatic in American history. It\r\nwas on the last night that Jackson, finding many of his friends had left\r\nthe Capitol, “pocketed” Clay’s Land Bill and his own veto. Naturally\r\nenough the session ended in bitter partisan wrangles and with much bad\r\nblood on both sides. Uproarious shouts of derision greeted the customary\r\nresolution of thanks to the Speaker. Many members were in a state of\r\nhopeless drunkenness. It was five o’clock in the morning when Adams\r\ninvited Edward Everett to ride home with him. The drowsy driver touched\r\nthe horses, and over the frozen ruts of the Avenue, the carriage jolted\r\nhomeward. Almost immediately the driver was asleep, and the carriage,\r\nstriking a rut in front of Gadsby’s, the sleepy statesmen narrowly\r\nescaped a plunge into the snow. Soon, however, they reached the\r\n“macadamized part of the Avenue,” without more mishaps; and having left\r\nEverett at his lodgings, Adams alighted and walked to his own home, with\r\nthe thermometer registering six below zero. Thus the last figure of that\r\nhistoric and bitter session of whom we catch a glimpse is that of the\r\nshort, blear-eyed ex-President, trudging homeward through the dark,\r\nill-paved Washington streets at five o’clock on a frigid morning.[609]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nJACKSON VS. BIDDLE\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nCongress adjourned two days before the second inauguration of Jackson,\r\nwhich lacked the spectacular features of the first. His brief inaugural\r\naddress revealed absolute confidence in the approval of the people.\r\nThere was nothing on the surface to warn of his purpose to continue an\r\naggressive war upon the Bank. The transfer of Livingston from the State\r\nDepartment to the Legation in Paris necessitated a reorganization of the\r\nCabinet. Louis McLane, unsympathetic toward the President’s Bank policy,\r\nwas moved from the Treasury to the State Department. This left the\r\nsecretaryship of the Treasury vacant, and it was of the highest\r\nimportance that it be filled by one in complete harmony with the\r\nExecutive plans.\r\n\r\nThe choice finally fell on William J. Duane of Philadelphia, variously\r\ndescribed as “a distinguished lawyer” and as “the bottom of the\r\nPhiladelphia bar.” His selection had been recommended by Van Buren[610]\r\nand urged by McLane, who was Van Buren’s intimate at the time.[611] He\r\nwas at least known to Jackson as the son of the fighting editor of the\r\n“Aurora,” which had led the fight against the Alien and Sedition\r\nLaws.[612] Assuming in the son the militant qualities of the father, and\r\nactuated partly, perhaps, by the thought that the appointment would\r\nstrengthen the Administration in its fight upon the Bank, Duane was\r\npressed to enter the Cabinet, and consented. The personality and\r\ncharacter of Duane are dim on the page of history. The Democratic press\r\nwas apparently hard put to explain the appointment. The “Harrisburg\r\nChronicle” described him as possessing “a well disciplined mind, severe\r\nhabits of business, which, combined with sound Democratic principles and\r\nunbending integrity, are the highest recommendations for office in a\r\nfree popular government.” Thomas Ritchie, of the “Richmond Enquirer,”\r\nwho made a more studied effort, feared that the appointment would\r\n“scarcely be hailed with the feeling of approbation which it so richly\r\ndeserves.” But Duane understood “the character of the Bank of the United\r\nStates--its designs and dangers,” and “on that cardinal subject we have\r\nno doubt he will deserve and command the confidence of the friends of\r\nthe Constitution.” The “Pennsylvanian” informed the National Democracy\r\nthat “Stephen Gerard saw and appreciated his talents,” and that he was\r\n“one of the most sagacious men of the age.”[613] It was only after his\r\nbreak with Jackson that the champions of the Bank discovered his many\r\nvirtues, and Administration circles his utter insignificance. One of\r\nJackson’s enemies, in berating him, referred to Duane as “that other\r\ndarling whom you fished up from the desk of a dead miser, and the bottom\r\nof the Philadelphia bar.”[614] At first, however, Jackson was much\r\nimpressed with his discovery, and frequently referred to him as “a chip\r\nof the old block, sir.”\r\n\r\nHaving reorganized his Cabinet, Jackson now concentrated on his plans\r\nfor the invasion of “the enemy’s country”--his New England tour. His\r\nremarkable popularity in that quarter, previously so hostile, grew out\r\nof his vigorous defense of the Union and his new relations with Webster.\r\nIn the spring of 1833 these relations were most cordial, and never were\r\nto become personally bitter. At that time he was not on speaking terms\r\nwith either Clay or Calhoun, and when he met Adams on the street, by\r\nchance, he bowed stiffly, without a word. But whenever, in his\r\nmeanderings about the dingy capital, he encountered Webster, the iron\r\nman would pause for a hearty greeting. And while Webster never ceased to\r\nconsider Jackson temperamentally unfit for the Presidency, he never\r\ndoubted his integrity or whole-hearted patriotism. “His patriotism,” he\r\nwas wont to say, “is no more to be questioned than that of\r\nWashington.”[615]\r\n\r\nIt was early in June that Jackson set forth in company with Van Buren,\r\nCass, Woodbury, Donelson, Hill, and the artist, Earle, who lived at the\r\nWhite House. From the moment the party reached Baltimore it was one\r\ncontinuous ovation. Received like a conquering hero in Philadelphia,\r\nwith an enthusiasm bordering on idolatry in New York City,[616] the\r\novations he received in Massachusetts eclipsed them all. Harvard\r\nconferred upon him the degree of Doctor of Laws, Everett delivered an\r\naddress of welcome at the foot of Bunker Hill, and while the multitude\r\nwent wild at sight of him in the streets and on the Common, the gentry\r\nof Beacon Street refused him the homage of appearing at the\r\nwindows,[617] and the crabbed Adams, hiding at his Quincy home, a few\r\nmiles away, poured forth his spleen upon his journal and mourned the\r\ndegradation of his Alma Mater.[618] Under the load of adulation, the old\r\nman’s strength finally failed, and during the last part of his progress\r\nhe dragged himself from his bed to the parade, and from the physician\r\nwith his barbarous lancet to the master of ceremonies.[619] Throughout\r\nthe tour his thoughts were centered on the Bank and his plans for the\r\nremoval of the deposits, and but few suspected that the courtly old\r\nman, whose eyes moistened and beamed at the applause of the crowds, was\r\nmeditating the step.\r\n\r\nWhen Hamilton called upon him at his hotel in New York, he found him\r\nobsessed with the subject. When the son of the father of the first\r\nNational Bank joined him in the presidential suite to accompany him to\r\nthe banquet, Jackson placed in his hands papers by several people urging\r\nthe removal of the deposits, with the request that he examine them\r\ncarefully and give him an opinion. Promising a careful perusal, Hamilton\r\nventured the suggestion that the proposed step was “a very questionable\r\none” that would “lead to great disturbances in commercial affairs.”[620]\r\nMeanwhile, when alone with Van Buren, the President was discussing the\r\nproject with him to his keen distress.[621] Throughout the tour, sick or\r\nwell, Jackson found time to work on the Vice-President and favorite, and\r\nwhen, at Concord, he finally won him over to the plan, the frail old man\r\nabandoned the tour and hastened back to Washington to begin a new\r\nbattle.[622] And Adams, learning of the curtailment of the trip, wrote\r\nthat “President Jackson has been obliged by the feeble state of his\r\nhealth to give up the remainder of his tour.”[623] Just how feeble\r\nJackson was we shall soon see.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nIt is impossible definitely to determine the time Jackson decided on the\r\nremoval of the deposits. The activity of the Bank in the presidential\r\ncampaign had not been lost upon him, and he probably had it under\r\nconsideration at that time. The historian of the Bank is convinced that\r\nsuch was the case.[624] Immediately after the election these rumors\r\nmultiplied, and Biddle was deluged with warnings, but without disturbing\r\nthe sublime serenity of his conceit. The autocrat of the Bank was\r\nsatisfied that the Calhoun following would thereafter be arrayed in\r\nfavor of the recharter. About this time Dr. Thomas Cooper, then\r\npresident of the College of South Carolina and one of the intellectual\r\nleaders of Nullification, wrote him of his allegiance to the cause.[625]\r\nBlair had already charged, in the “Globe,” that there was a coalition\r\nbetween the forces of Clay, Calhoun, and Biddle, and made much of the\r\nfact that more Bank stock was owned in South Carolina than in all the\r\nother States of the Union south of the Potomac and west of the Alleghany\r\nMountains.[626] The Democratic disaffection, together with the temporary\r\nalliance between Jackson and Webster, was quite enough to restore\r\nconfidence to the ever sanguine Biddle,[627] who took no pains to\r\nconceal his satisfaction. This was water on the wheel of Blair, who,\r\nIago-like, and always at Jackson’s elbow, kept impressing him with the\r\nidea that the Bank planned and expected an ultimate triumph. In this\r\nwork he was ably seconded by Amos Kendall and James A. Hamilton, who\r\nwrote from New York that “a gentleman whose knowledge of the views of\r\nthe U.S. Bank is only second to that of its President” had informed him\r\nthat it expected to get a new charter.[628] It was firmly believed by\r\nAmos Kendall that the Bank’s purpose in adding $28,000,000 to its\r\ndiscounts, and multiplying its debtors and dependents, was to serve a\r\npolitical end in the campaign of 1836, and with characteristic\r\npersistency he urged the removal of the deposits to prevent their use\r\nfor political purposes.[629] Jackson himself feared the effect of loans\r\nand legal retainers to members of the Congress. In all these suspicions\r\nthere was ample justification.[630] It did not require much, knowing as\r\nhe did the character of the banker, to persuade Jackson that his duty\r\nwas plain, and during the winter and spring of 1833 he was in frequent\r\nconsultation with Roger Taney, Amos Kendall, and Frank Blair, the three\r\nmen responsible for the step he took.\r\n\r\nDuring these days of mysterious conferences, the conservative members of\r\nthe Cabinet, and Van Buren with the traditional timidity of the\r\ncandidate, were gravely concerned. To none was the prospect more\r\nappalling than to Louis McLane, then Secretary of the Treasury, a\r\nconservative, a former Federalist, and a prospective candidate for the\r\nPresidency. In his anxiety he sent for Kendall, avowed his doubts, and\r\nasked for information. In the end he frankly confessed that he was not\r\nsatisfied as to the wisdom of the step, but that he would execute the\r\nplan if called upon to do so by the President. The interview was\r\nfriendly, and Kendall returned to his office and prepared, for McLane’s\r\nedification, an elaborate argument in favor of the removal. It is\r\ncharacteristic of Kendall that, while the paper lightly touched upon the\r\nalleged insecurity of the deposits, the greater part of the paper was a\r\ndiscussion of the political effect. The hostility of the Bank to the\r\nAdministration, he thought, could not be intensified. If the deposits\r\nwere placed with the State banks, they would become partisans of the\r\nAdministration. The people of the Southern and Western States would be\r\npleased, and the New York banks, always jealous of the financial\r\npreëminence of Philadelphia, would at least secretly rejoice. The New\r\nEngland States were not concerned, one way or the other, and could be\r\nsafely ignored. And in the end, Kendall insisted that a failure to\r\nremove the deposits would make a recharter certain. That this letter,\r\nwritten March 16, 1833, was promptly placed in the hands of Van Buren,\r\nwho was McLane’s sponsor in the Administration, there can be no doubt.\r\n\r\nThe aftermath of the letter came a few days later, when Van Buren,\r\nmeeting Kendall at a White House dinner, warmly protested against the\r\nplans of the Kitchen Cabinet. The genius of that famous group rose from\r\nthe table in his excitement, declared that failure to remove the\r\ndeposits made a Whig victory certain in 1836, and that he was prepared\r\nto lay down his pen. “I can live under a corrupt despotism,” he\r\nexclaimed, “as well as any other man by keeping out of its way, which I\r\nshall certainly do.”[631] It was the Vice-President and not the auditor\r\nof the Treasury who afterwards apologized.\r\n\r\nIt was under these conditions that Jackson propounded a series of\r\nquestions to his Cabinet, with a preliminary statement that he favored\r\nthe removal. The first count of noses in the official household showed\r\nLivingston and Cass for the Bank, Barry and Taney against it, with\r\nWoodbury hedging. McLane, having greater responsibility as the head of\r\nthe Treasury, took two months in the preparation of an exhaustive reply\r\nopposing the removal, and his argument was afterwards to be used against\r\nthe Administration.\r\n\r\nA month after Congress had adjourned there was a relaxation of tension\r\nin Bank circles and among the conservatives of the Administration party,\r\nwho assumed that nothing would be done during the congressional recess.\r\nThe hostility of a majority of the Cabinet had not abated, and Biddle\r\nthought that the deposits were safe.\r\n\r\nBut if the official Cabinet was to hear no more, for months, of the\r\nproposed removal, the Kitchen Cabinet went into almost continuous\r\nsession for the consideration of this one subject. The disposal of the\r\ndeposits, and the time for making the removal, were the principal\r\nsubjects discussed during those spring days in the White House, and it\r\nrequired but little discussion to determine upon the time. Hugh Lawson\r\nWhite strongly urged the postponement of action until Congress\r\nconvened, but this was instantly overruled by Taney and Kendall, who\r\nurged a recess removal for different reasons. The Attorney-General\r\nfavored such action “because it is desirable that the members should be\r\namong their constituents when the measure is announced, and should bring\r\nwith them when they come here, the feelings and sentiments of the\r\npeople.”[632] Kendall suggested another reason, also political. The\r\nconservatives had made some impression on Jackson’s mind with the\r\nwarning that, if he removed the deposits, Congress would order them\r\nrestored, and he appealed to Kendall for his opinion. “If I were\r\ncertain,” said Kendall, “that Congress would direct them to be restored,\r\nstill they ought to be removed, and any order by Congress for their\r\nrestoration disregarded; for it is the only means by which this\r\nembodiment of power which aims to govern Congress and the country can be\r\ndestroyed.” And, to this militant advice, he added his reasons for\r\nfavoring the removal during the congressional recess. “Let the removal\r\ntake place so early as to give us several months to defend the measure\r\nin the ‘Globe,’ and we will bring up the people to sustain you with a\r\npower which Congress dare not resist.”[633]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Duane had reached Washington and assumed his duties. Soon\r\nafter his arrival, Kendall was surprised to find him loath to discuss\r\nthe removal, and when the story of this reticence was carried to\r\nJackson, he explained to his Secretary of the Treasury what was wanted.\r\nWhen Duane demurred, he was told to take his time and report on the\r\nPresident’s return from New England. By this time Amos Kendall had\r\nassumed the leadership, and he was instructed to interview the head of\r\nthe Treasury during Jackson’s absence.\r\n\r\nAt this time Van Buren, waiting in New York to join his chief on his\r\ntour, was blissfully ignorant of the embarrassments that awaited him\r\nuntil he received a letter written on the day Jackson set forth on his\r\njourney. “The Bank and change of deposits have engrossed my mind much,”\r\nhe wrote; “it is a perplexing subject, and I wish your opinion before I\r\nfinally act.” Three days later, while Jackson was receiving the plaudits\r\nof the multitude, Kendall made the situation clear, in a letter to Van\r\nBuren, announcing that the removal had been determined upon and\r\noutlining the tentative plans. Nothing could have been more painful to\r\nthe Vice-President, who had strongly urged that, with the veto of the\r\nrecharter bill, the Bank be permitted quietly to go its way to the\r\ntermination of its charter.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nWhile Jackson between illnesses and ovations was bringing the power of\r\nhis compelling personality to bear upon his protégé’s timidity, Kendall\r\nwas following instructions in Washington in attempting to ascertain the\r\nintentions of Duane. In this he was wholly unsuccessful. Time and again\r\nthe subject was broached only to be brushed aside, and Jackson,\r\nconstantly informed, had some savage moments while smiling urbanely upon\r\nthe crowds.\r\n\r\nReaching the capital on July 4th, he immediately summoned Duane to a\r\nconference. The Secretary, who had been ill, rose from a sick-bed and\r\npresented himself at the White House looking pale and feeble. At the\r\nsight of his wan adviser, the impulsive Jackson penitently grasped both\r\nhis hands, reproved him for venturing forth in such a condition, and\r\nkindly postponed the interview until he had recovered.[634] After an\r\nabsence of eight days Duane appeared at the White House again, with a\r\nlengthy letter setting forth his reasons for objecting to the removal\r\nuntil after Congress had been informed. Three days later, or on July\r\n15th, another conference between Jackson and his rebellious Secretary\r\nwas held with Duane stubbornly holding his ground, and Jackson kindness\r\nitself. In truth, it appears that, with the aid of McLane, Duane had\r\nsucceeded in arousing some misgivings in Jackson’s mind as to the\r\npossibility of persuading the State banks to accept the deposits.\r\n\r\n“Send me to ask them, and I will settle that question,” said Kendall.\r\n\r\n“You shall go,” Jackson replied.\r\n\r\nSummoning the unhappy Duane, the President announced a postponement of\r\ndiscussions until the attitude of the State banks could be ascertained.\r\nKendall was to be the agent of the Treasury on a tour of investigation,\r\nand Duane was to prepare the necessary instructions.\r\n\r\nWhen these instructions were delivered to Kendall, he was amazed. They\r\nmerely asked the opinions of the banks on the general question, and, in\r\nview of their well-established hostility, it was clear enough what the\r\nanswer would be. Wrathfully hastening to the White House, Kendall\r\nbluntly refused to carry instructions so framed, declaring the sole\r\npurpose of the investigation should be to learn whether State banks\r\nwould accept the deposits. He was told to prepare his own instructions,\r\nand thus the head of the Kitchen Cabinet sallied forth on his own terms.\r\nAbout the same time, Jackson, in need of a rest and release from the\r\nsultry atmosphere of Washington, went to Rip Raps in Hampton Roads,\r\nwhere he was accustomed to relax in the summer, accompanied by Frank\r\nBlair. Thus, with one member of the Kitchen Cabinet making a tour of the\r\nbanks on his own instructions, another was at Jackson’s elbow in the\r\nunconventional environment of Rip Raps.[635] All these various moves\r\nwere promptly reported to Biddle by some member of the Administration,\r\nand on the day Kendall was expected in Philadelphia, the financial\r\nautocrat was writing to Dr. Cooper, his new ally, in laudation of the\r\nfirmness of Duane and the viciousness of the Kitchen Cabinet.[636]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in his visits to the banks of Baltimore, Philadelphia, New\r\nYork, and Boston, Kendall was pulled and hauled and mauled by both the\r\nservitors of the Bank and the conservatives of the Administration\r\ncircle. At Philadelphia it was hinted that a fortune was within his\r\ngrasp if he would but avail himself of the opportunity.[637] There, too,\r\nhe fell foul of James Gordon Bennett, then editor of the\r\n“Pennsylvanian,” whose mask of cordiality was dropped in the publication\r\nof Kendall’s private letters showing hostility to the Bank--as though\r\nprivate letters were necessary to the proof.[638]\r\n\r\nBut more significant, and politically more important, was Kendall’s\r\ninterview with Van Buren and McLane in New York City. The three met by\r\nchance in the breakfast room of an hotel, and in an interview, then\r\narranged, it was proposed by the hedging politicians that the removal of\r\nthe deposits be postponed until January when Congress would be in\r\nsession. This plan originated with McLane, and Kendall, who suspected it\r\nwas proposed with the hope and expectation that Congress would\r\ninterpose, replied that he would be satisfied provided McLane, Duane,\r\nand the other Bank Democrats would agree to use their personal influence\r\nwith members of Congress to have the deposits removed.[639] It was\r\nagreed that all three should write Jackson at Rip Raps, and, in\r\ncomplying, Kendall said that the proposal was against his judgment, and\r\nJackson instantly rejected it.[640]\r\n\r\nThroughout July the Opposition and Bank papers were warning the public\r\nof the movement on foot, and the “Intelligencer” was especially\r\nalarmed, dwelling at length on the rumor that Kendall was in\r\nPhiladelphia before he had even left Washington. Blair was moved to\r\nmirth. He admitted that Kendall had been seen taking a stage, carrying\r\nwith him “a large black trunk,” and that, while he “looked charitable,\r\nhis intent may be wicked.” Worse still, “the Editor of the ‘Globe’ left\r\nfor the South two days before with baggage enough to last a man a\r\nlifetime.” A mysterious, uncanny combination of events, he conceded,\r\nthat “bodes to owners of U.S. Bank stock, who purchased at 50 per cent,\r\nno good.”[641]\r\n\r\nThis facetiousness enraged and alarmed the Opposition, and its press\r\nbegan to threaten to impeach Duane if he removed the deposits. Kendall\r\nwas scourged with excoriations, and State banks were warned against\r\ntaking the deposits on pain of the displeasure of the Biddle\r\ninstitution. Papers under the influence of the Bank, but still posing as\r\nJacksonian, were sure that Jackson “and his able Secretary of the\r\nTreasury” would “not be hurried or retarded in his important measure by\r\nthe violent and indiscreet denunciations and threats of any set of men,”\r\nand would “act on the deposits at the proper time and in the proper\r\nway.”[642] And Blair, catching the subtle suggestion of Bennett,\r\nhastened to assail him as having been “smuggled into the confidence of\r\nan unsuspecting Democracy as a friend of the cause” and as a\r\n“treacherous instrument of Webb and Biddle,” who had “the impudence to\r\npropose by praise to flatter the President and his Cabinet to adopt the\r\nviews of the Bank.”[643] From his sanctum in the office of the “Albany\r\nJournal,” Thurlow Weed, wisest of the Whig journalists, sent forth the\r\nthreat of panic. “We are impatient for the removal,” he wrote. “Nothing\r\nshort of a general ruin will cure the people of their delusions, and the\r\nsooner it comes, the better.”[644]\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Jackson at Rip Raps was in daily conference with Frank Blair\r\non the problems of the removal. All this time Blair was creating the\r\nimpression in the “Globe” that the President’s sole thought was the\r\nrecovery of his health. The sea air was “proving advantageous,” his\r\nappetite better, his strength returning. Nothing was more remote from\r\nthe thoughts of Jackson. The situation was delicate and politically\r\nmixed. The Cabinet was, for the most part, hostile. Conservative\r\nDemocrats were terrified at the thought of such radical action, and\r\nfeared the complete disruption of the party and its defeat in 1836.\r\nKendall does not misstate the conditions when he says that “the\r\nambitious politicians who still surrounded General Jackson, trembled in\r\ntheir knees, and were ready to fly,” and that “almost the only fearless\r\nand determined supporters he had around him were Mr. Taney, the editor\r\nof the ‘Globe,’ and its few contributors.”[645] The brilliant, but\r\nultra-conservative Ritchie, of the “Richmond Enquirer,” feared that the\r\nparty would “rue the precipitate step in sackcloth and ashes,” and that\r\nit would “present nothing but a splendid ruin.”[646]\r\n\r\nPainful as the situation was to all conservatives, it was maddening to\r\nVan Buren, who thought he saw the Presidency slipping from his grasp. In\r\nhis desire to get as far away as possible, he was planning a month’s\r\nouting with Washington Irving among the Dutch settlements of Long Island\r\nand the North River, when a letter reached him from Jackson calling upon\r\nhim to take a stand. His reply, under date of August 19th, would have\r\npleased Talleyrand. Having great confidence in Silas Wright, Senator\r\nfrom New York, he wrote that he would confer with him and then formulate\r\nhis views. A little later he wrote that he and Wright favored the\r\nMcLane plan. The tone of sharp surprise in Jackson’s response alarmed\r\nthe hard-pressed heir apparent, and he hastily wrote that he would yield\r\nto the wisdom of Jackson. But his troubles were not over. Another letter\r\nfrom Jackson, more alarming still, pursued him to poison his vacation,\r\nsummoning him to Washington for a consultation. The cunning politician\r\nnever faced a more painful problem. He could not afford to break with\r\nthe all-powerful party dictator in the White House--that would be to\r\nabandon the Presidency. Nor was he at all certain that he could afford\r\nto become intimately identified with the desperate enterprise upon which\r\nthe chief was determined to embark. The one would deprive him of the\r\nnomination of his party; the other might make that nomination worthless.\r\nThe campaign of 1836 was already in full swing, and the Opposition was\r\ninsinuating a directing influence between the most unpopular measures of\r\nthe Administration and Van Buren. Timid and cautious by temperament, his\r\npeculiar situation accentuated these traits in the candidate, and the\r\nsummons to the seat of war sounded to him like the crack of doom.\r\n\r\nBut he was equal to the crisis. Writing at once of his willingness to\r\nrespond if Jackson thought best, he feared his presence in Washington at\r\nthe time of the withdrawal would dim the prestige of the act by giving\r\nit the appearance of having been inspired by the moneyed interests of\r\nNew York.[647] Having painted this thought, he added some lines for the\r\nprotection of Louis McLane, his friend. He was fearful that, on the\r\nresignation of Duane, McLane might feel that he should also tender his,\r\nand that would be a pity. Would it not be a good idea, in the event the\r\nresignation were offered, to reply that “you confide in him &c.,\r\nnotwithstanding the difference between you on this point, and that if he\r\ncould consistently remain in the Administration, you would be\r\ngratified?” That the suspicious Jackson was deceived is highly\r\nimprobable, albeit where his affections were involved, as in the case of\r\nVan Buren, his vision was apt to be occasionally defective.\r\n\r\nBut Van Buren and his advice were not needed, for a stronger man, with\r\ncourage and an iron will equal to his own, was moving to the side of\r\nJackson. Throughout the months of conferences and discussions the one\r\nmember of his official Cabinet who was in whole-hearted sympathy with\r\nthe wishes of the Kitchen Cabinet was Roger Taney, the Attorney-General.\r\nBefore leaving for Rip Raps, Jackson had discussed with him the steps to\r\nbe taken in the event of a definite refusal from Duane to order the\r\nremoval, and had intimated that he would transfer Taney to the office of\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury. Just about the time Jackson was puzzling\r\nover the peculiar hedging of Van Buren, he received a letter from Taney\r\nthat delighted him. The latter reiterated his conviction that the\r\ndeposits should be removed, and during the congressional recess. He was\r\nsure “the powerful and corrupting monopoly” would “be fatal to the\r\nliberties of the people” unless destroyed, and Jackson alone could\r\nencompass its destruction. The President had “already done more than any\r\nother man has done, or could do, to preserve the simplicity and purity\r\nof our institutions, and to guard the country from this dangerous and\r\npowerful instrument of corruption.” He had “doubted” whether Jackson’s\r\nfriends and the country had the right to ask him “to bear the brunt of\r\nsuch a conflict as the removal of the deposits under present conditions\r\nis likely to produce.” He had no desire for the secretaryship of the\r\nTreasury, but he “would not shrink from the responsibility” if, in the\r\nPresident’s judgment, “the public exigency would require” him to\r\nundertake it.[648] Here was a man quite as persuasive in his flattery as\r\nVan Buren, and prepared, as Van Buren was not, to stake his future upon\r\nan aggressive support of the removal.\r\n\r\nFor the time being, then, exit Van Buren.\r\n\r\nEnter Roger B. Taney.\r\n\r\nBy this time Jackson’s mind was thoroughly made up. The tour of Kendall\r\nhad not been a complete success. The banks were timid and fearful of the\r\npower of “The Monster.” Catterall credits the report that Kendall\r\nhimself had concluded the plan unwise, and had admitted to Jackson that\r\n“the project of removing the deposits must be given up.”[649] This\r\nadvice, if given,[650] came too late. The old military leader was in the\r\nsaddle, war was declared, retreat was defeat. Thus, a few days after\r\nreceiving Taney’s letter, Jackson wrote him that he had considered the\r\nprobability that Congress would attempt to overawe him, and had\r\ndetermined that, when Duane withdrew, Taney should step into the place\r\nand conduct the affairs of the Treasury until toward the close of the\r\nnext session of Congress, when the battle would have been won or lost,\r\nand the refusal of the Senate to confirm Taney’s nomination would not\r\ninterfere. He was only awaiting proof of the expenditure of $40,000 of\r\nBank money in the campaign. With this proof, of which he had no doubt,\r\nhe would feel justified in removing the deposits. The Bank might “rebel\r\nagainst our power, and even refuse to pay to the order of the Government\r\nthe public money in its vaults, and lay claim to all the money that\r\nremains uncalled for on the books of the loan office.” Everywhere he\r\nfound the “assumed power of this monster.” This pretension must be\r\nchallenged and tested, and he had no doubt of being “sustained by the\r\npeople.”[651]\r\n\r\nThus the die was definitely cast at Rip Raps early in September, and\r\nJackson returned to Washington determined to force the fighting.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nAs soon as he reached the capital, he began to press Duane more\r\ninsistently, with the Secretary stubbornly refusing to budge. Some time\r\nbefore he had voluntarily given the assurance that if the President\r\nshould determine upon the course outlined, and he should be unable to\r\ncomply, he would promptly tender his resignation. The President’s\r\nintentions were now thoroughly understood, but Duane gave no indication\r\nof a disposition to relinquish his post, and the pro-Bank papers were\r\ndecorating him with laurels. The first covert attack upon him from\r\nAdministration circles appeared in the “Globe” of September 12th, when\r\nBlair, taking cognizance of an article in the “Baltimore Chronicle,”\r\ndenounced it as a “slanderer of Mr. Duane.” “Would the ‘Chronicle’\r\nconvert the Secretary of the Treasury into a Bank officer, and have him\r\ncommunicating to the corporation what belongs only to his relations with\r\nthe President?” Even Duane could not have mistaken the implication. Five\r\ndays after this article appeared, the Cabinet was convened, and Jackson\r\ntook the opinion of his advisers. McLane, Duane, and Cass were against\r\nthe step, with Taney, Barry, and Woodbury (who had previously hedged),\r\nfavoring it.\r\n\r\nOn the following day the Cabinet was again convened to hear the\r\nPresident’s reasons for his determination, set forth in the famous\r\n“Paper Read to the Cabinet.” This document, as read, had been revised\r\nand rewritten from the notes sent by Jackson from his retreat at Hampton\r\nRoads to Taney, and was to become the storm center of congressional\r\ncontroversy, although it did not concern the Congress in the least.\r\nBeginning with a confession of a fixed hostility to the Bank on the\r\nconviction of its unconstitutionality and danger to the liberties of the\r\npeople, he elaborately reviewed the charter controversy. The people had\r\npassed upon his conduct at the polls and he had been overwhelmingly\r\nvindicated. The Nation, therefore, having definitely decided on the\r\nabandonment of the Bank as a place of deposit, some method should be\r\ndevised for the future deposit of the public funds before the expiration\r\nof the charter. Under the law, the Secretary of the Treasury could\r\nwithdraw the deposits whenever he saw fit, provided he informed Congress\r\nof his act at the earliest opportunity. To leave the deposits with the\r\nBank until the day of the expiration of the charter with the expectation\r\nof making the transfer to some other depository at once would mean\r\n“serious inconvenience to the Government and people.” Such work, he\r\nthought, “ought not to be the work of months only, but of years,” for\r\notherwise “much suffering and distress would be brought upon the\r\npeople.” These considerations alone, he thought sufficient to justify\r\nthe step he proposed.\r\n\r\nBut in the conduct of the Bank additional and more pressing reasons\r\ncould be found. Knowing of the Government’s decision to appropriate the\r\ngreater part of its deposits during 1832 to the payment of the public\r\ndebt, the Bank, in the sixteen months preceding May, 1832, had extended\r\nits loans more than $28,000,000, and the maximum of the extension had\r\nbeen made in May. And two months before that, the Bank had so perfectly\r\nunderstood its inability to pay over the public deposits when called\r\nupon, that it had secretly negotiated with foreign holders of the three\r\nper cent stock a year’s postponement of a demand for payment after\r\nnotice should be given by the Government. “This effort to thwart the\r\nGovernment in the payment of the public debt,” he said, “that it might\r\nretain the public money to be used for their private interests,\r\npalliated by pretenses notoriously unfounded and insincere, would have\r\njustified the instant withdrawal of the public deposits.”\r\n\r\nSince the congressional report in favor of the Bank, other things had\r\noccurred that would surely alter the opinion of the lawmakers. “The fact\r\nthat the Bank controls, and in some cases substantially owns, and by\r\nits money supports, some of the leading presses of the country, is now\r\nmore clearly established.” Extravagant sums had been loaned to editors\r\non unusual time and nominal security in 1831 and 1832. And the\r\nproceedings and management of the Bank had been unusual and\r\nindefensible. The terms of the charter had been violated; and when\r\nGovernment directors undertook to restore methods in conformity with the\r\nterms of the charter, they had been disregarded. Worse still: the most\r\nimportant transactions involving the credit of the Bank had been turned\r\nover to Biddle, and the committees left in utter ignorance of what he\r\nwas doing. He had been given unlimited authority in the use of the\r\nBank’s money for propaganda purposes. Thousands of dollars had been\r\nsquandered in the printing of speeches and pamphlets, not only defending\r\nthe Bank, but attacking the chosen representatives of the people. If, as\r\nclaimed, the Bank could bring distress and chaos in retaliation, all the\r\nmore reason for breaking the power of the tyrannical institution. And he\r\nclosed by fixing October 1st as the day for action.\r\n\r\nAs the members of the Cabinet sat in the White House that day under\r\nconflicting emotions, all appreciating the seriousness of the step, and\r\nsome contemplating the closing of a career, there could have been none\r\nunmindful of the fact that the Paper was intended less for them than for\r\nthe public. It was characteristic of Jackson in preparing his ground for\r\na fight to speak over the heads of both Cabinet and Congress to the\r\npeople. That Kendall and Blair were in large part responsible for the\r\noriginal draft which reached Taney for revision, there can be no doubt.\r\n\r\nKnowing the real purpose of the Paper, Duane requested a postponement of\r\npublication until he could definitely decide. While the Paper was being\r\nput in type at the “Globe” office, McLane and Cass threatened to resign\r\nrather than accept any responsibility for the act, and Lewis suggested\r\nthat they be publicly relieved of responsibility. When Blair hastened\r\nto Jackson with Lewis’s suggestion, the grim man of iron added the\r\nconcluding paragraph assuming full personal responsibility--much to the\r\nchagrin and disgust of Taney.[652]\r\n\r\nThe crisis had now been reached, and the action of Duane was awaited by\r\nthe Kitchen Cabinet with the keenest interest, not unmixed with fear\r\nlest Taney decline to take the vacant place and face the bitter fight.\r\nTaking counsel of his fears, Kendall rushed to the Attorney-General and\r\nwas reassured. Confessing his fear that his acceptance would mean the\r\nend of his lifelong hopes for a place on the Supreme Bench, Taney\r\ndeclared himself in the fight to the end.[653]\r\n\r\nOn September 21st, the “Globe” authoritatively announced that “the\r\ndeposits would be changed to State banks” as soon as the necessary\r\narrangements could be made; and in anticipation of the nature of the war\r\nthe Bank would wage, Blair stressed the fact that the deposits would not\r\nbe immediately withdrawn, and that the process would be gradual. “It is\r\nbelieved,” he wrote, “that by this means the change need not produce any\r\ninconvenience to the commercial community.”\r\n\r\nFour days later the “Paper Read to the Cabinet” appeared in full in the\r\n“Globe.”\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nTwo days after this publication, Major Lewis wrote Hamilton that “if Mr.\r\nDuane cannot or will not make the order,” he would be superseded by\r\nTaney, “who has been decidedly with the President in relation to this\r\nmatter from the beginning to the end,” and discrediting rumors of other\r\nCabinet resignations.[654] Whatever may have been the feelings of\r\nHamilton, who looked upon the plan as fraught with possibilities of\r\ndisaster, the effect of the “Globe’s” announcement on Thomas H. Benton,\r\nsojourning with relatives in Virginia, was that of a bugle blast to a\r\nwar charger. He felt “an emotion of the moral sublime at beholding such\r\nan instance of civic heroism,” and that “a great blow had been struck,\r\nand that a great contest must come on, which could only be crowned with\r\nsuccess by acting up to the spirit with which it was commenced.” He\r\n“repaired to Washington at the approach of the session with a full\r\ndetermination to stand by the President.”[655]\r\n\r\nThe day after the reading of the Paper, Jackson called upon Duane for a\r\ndecision, and the Secretary begged for time to confer with his venerable\r\nfather, then _en route_ to Washington. The same day Major Donelson, the\r\nPresident’s secretary, informed him of the decision to publish the Paper\r\nin the “Globe” on the morrow, and the hard-pressed Minister protested\r\nagainst such precipitancy. This protest was followed with a letter to\r\nDonelson reiterating his plea for time, with the assertion that if he\r\nwere President he would “consult at least reasonably the feelings of a\r\nman who has already anxiety enough.”[656] Jackson had, in fact,\r\nexercised a most unnatural restraint of his temper, and had been\r\nremarkably considerate of his Minister’s feelings. Even before the\r\nreading of the Paper, and before Duane had made his choice for\r\nmartyrdom, Jackson had opened a graceful avenue of escape to the\r\nLegation at St. Petersburg, but the offer had been declined.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st, Duane appeared at the White House and left his written\r\ndecision with Jackson personally. It is a letter of many words,\r\nevidently prepared for publication. After asserting that the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury is, by the terms of the charter, the sole custodian of\r\nthe public funds, he finally reached his reasons for refusing to “carry\r\nyour directions into effect.” It would be a “breach of public faith,”\r\nwould appear as “vindictive and arbitrary,” and “if the Bank has abused\r\nor perverted its powers, the judiciary are able and willing to punish.”\r\nThe House of Representatives had declared the funds safe, and, if\r\nanything had happened since its report, “the representatives of the\r\npeople, chosen since your appeal to them in your veto message, will in a\r\nfew weeks assemble.” Again, “a change to local and irresponsible banks\r\nwill tend to shake public confidence,” and “it is not sound policy to\r\nfoster local banks.” And so on with other reasons, including the charge\r\nthat “persons and presses known to be in the confidence and pay of the\r\nAdministration” had tried to intimidate him. There could be no\r\nmisunderstanding of the purpose of the letter. It was written in a\r\nspirit bitterly hostile to the Administration, and in the hope of\r\nserving the moneyed institution and having the service rewarded.[657]\r\nHaving thus insulted the President, he withdrew his promise of July to\r\nresign if unable to meet his chief’s views, and carefully pointed out\r\nthat Jackson had the power of dismissal. Here was a martyr zealously\r\nseeking the cross.\r\n\r\nJackson immediately wrote a brief, dignified reply to the effect that he\r\ncould not receive such a communication, nor “enter into further\r\ndiscussion of the question.” Rather sharply, the grim old man reminded\r\nhis subordinate that the imputation in the latter’s letter had no place\r\nin a correspondence between a President and a member of his Cabinet,\r\nthat the letter of July offering to resign was before him, and brusquely\r\ndemanding a final answer. Early in the afternoon Duane again took his\r\npen in hand. The result was another tiresome letter concluding with a\r\ndistinct refusal to issue the order or to resign, and impudently\r\nprotesting against the interference of the Executive in the affairs of a\r\nmember of the Cabinet. This second letter could hardly have reached the\r\nWhite House when Duane, seized with a perfect passion for\r\nself-expression, wrote a third “to present another view.” The burden of\r\nthis epistle was that he had been treated unkindly by the “Globe.”\r\nHaving started this upon its way by messenger, the superheated Secretary\r\ngrasped his pen for another effort, consisting of painful reiterations.\r\nAll these letters, thousands of words, and pages of paper, were written\r\non the 21st, but with the exception of the reply to the first, Jackson\r\nignored them. Then, two days later, Jackson wrote a short note,\r\nreturning the last two letters as containing inaccuracies and being\r\ninadmissible, and closing with a curt dismissal. Thus Duane laid down\r\nhis pen, packed his belongings, and passed out of public life.[658]\r\n\r\nThe day following Duane’s dismissal, written by Taney, Cass and McLane\r\nconsulted Jackson as to the desirability of their resignations. This was\r\nalmost too much for the old warrior’s patience, and he irritably\r\nreminded them that they had been released from responsibility, and could\r\nremain unless they preferred to join the Opposition. The fire of battle\r\nwas now in his blood, and he had no intention of parleying with the\r\ntimid in his official household. Three days later, Taney issued his\r\nfamous order, McLane and Cass tendered their resignations, and Jackson,\r\nin replying, followed Van Buren’s suggestion, and they remained.\r\n\r\nOn the publication of the Paper in the “Globe,” the Bank summoned a\r\nmeeting of the directors and a committee was appointed to take action.\r\nWriting from Boston to Biddle, Webster made the suggestion, which was\r\nadopted, of a memorial to Congress.[659] This memorial, which referred\r\nto the President of the United States as “Andrew Jackson,” indicated a\r\ndisposition to consider the approaching struggle as between “Andrew\r\nJackson” and Nicholas Biddle, between the Bank and the Administration,\r\nand the ill-advised arrogance of the paper showed all too clearly that\r\nthe financiers felt that in such a contest the power and the victory\r\nwould be on the side of the Bank. And such was the prestige of that\r\npowerful corporation that not a few Democrats, including friends and\r\nsupporters of Jackson, shared in the feeling. When Van Buren was\r\nauthorized by Jackson to offer the attorney-generalship to Daniel of\r\nVirginia, that timid lawyer admitted that his fears of Jackson’s\r\nrashness and situation dissuaded him.[660] It was not until early in\r\nNovember that Benjamin F. Butler, yielding to the personal persuasion of\r\nVan Buren, accepted the post. And to obtain his consent it was necessary\r\nto appeal to personal friendship, private interest, pecuniary benefit,\r\nand the allurements of fame.[661]\r\n\r\nAnd almost immediately the storm broke.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n“The times will be hard, and the struggle a great one,” wrote Van Buren\r\nto Hamilton, “but the patriotism and fortitude of the people will\r\ntriumph.”[662] And Nicholas Biddle did not propose that the\r\ninconvenience should be slight. He was delighted with the order for the\r\nremoval. He was convinced that out of the distress in business circles\r\nwould come an irresistible demand, not only for the restoration of the\r\ndeposits, but for the rechartering of the Bank. This last act of\r\nJackson’s was the golden opportunity. The advantage would be followed.\r\nThe public, which had sustained Jackson at the polls, was to be\r\npunished, or “disciplined,” as Webster mildly described the process.\r\n“This discipline,” wrote the orator to Biddle, who was his client as\r\nwell as his party colleague, “it appears to me, must have very great\r\neffects on the general question of the rechartering of the Bank.”\r\n\r\nThe “disciplining” of the people began with the Bank’s first\r\ncurtailments on August 13, 1833, and practically ended on July 11, 1834,\r\nalthough it continued to some extent until September. The first move--a\r\nproper one--was to issue an order that the amount of money loaned on\r\ndiscounts was not to be increased, and that bills of exchange should be\r\ndrawn only at short dates and on the Eastern offices. These orders meant\r\ninevitable contraction, but of the sort that could be justified. But\r\nimmediately after Taney had issued his order, the Bank adopted\r\nadditional measures--the reduction of discounts, the application of the\r\norder of restriction on the drawing of bills to all the offices of the\r\nBank, the collection of the balances against the State banks, and the\r\nrestriction of the receipt of State bank notes. The historian of the\r\nBank truly says that “on the whole, nothing but peril to the Bank could\r\nexcuse such measures.”[663] But even this second step seemed all too\r\nmild to the officers and directors in the marble front building on\r\nChestnut Street, and three weeks later a third step was taken. The\r\nbranch banks in the West were ordered to persevere in “the course of\r\nmeasures already prescribed,” and instructed that an extraordinary\r\neffort should be made to keep down circulation, and to avoid drafts on\r\nthe northern Atlantic offices.[664] One month later, Philip Hone, the\r\nNew York banker and business man, was recording in his diary that the\r\n“ill-advised and arbitrary step of the President” was “producing an\r\nawful scarcity of money, with immediate distress and melancholy\r\nforebodings to the merchants and others who require credit to sustain\r\nthem”; and that “stocks of every description have fallen--Delaware and\r\nHudson from one hundred and twenty-five to one hundred and fourteen,\r\nBoston and Providence from one hundred and fifteen to one hundred and\r\nthree,” and that “money cannot be had on bond and mortgage at 7 per\r\ncent, and I am told that good notes will hardly be discounted at 9 per\r\ncent.”[665]\r\n\r\nJust about the time Hone was recording these conditions, Biddle was\r\noffering the notorious Samuel Swartwout, the Jacksonian Collector in New\r\nYork, whose irregularities in office were to be unmercifully exploited\r\nby the Whigs, a directorship in the Bank, and the latter, declining\r\nbecause of the onerous duties of his office, advised that since “the\r\nBank’s power has been shown” in the distress, it might be well now to\r\nmanifest mercy.[666] Where Niles had found money scarce in September and\r\nOctober without being able to conceive a reason, he wrote in November of\r\n“a most severe pressure for money” and the prospect of a “collapse of\r\nbusiness.” That month State bank notes began to depreciate and loans\r\nwere at eighteen per cent per annum. With the convening of Congress and\r\nthe President’s uncompromising Message in December, Biddle increased the\r\npressure for the purposes of “discipline.” Business men were unable to\r\nget credit. Factories were shutting down because of the inability of\r\nmanufacturers to get loans, and laborers were thrown out into the\r\nstreet. The Christmas season found New York “gloomy” with “times bad,”\r\nstocks still falling, and a panic prevailing “which will result in\r\nbankruptcies and ruin in many quarters where, a few short weeks ago, the\r\nsun of prosperity shone with unusual brightness.”[667] And three days\r\nlater the Lord Holland of the American Whigs, in his misery and\r\napprehension, was beginning to suspect that politics and the Bank, as\r\nwell as Jackson’s “ill-advised and arbitrary step,” might be playing a\r\npart, and concluding that “between them both the community groans under\r\nthe distress which these misunderstandings have created.” “A plague on\r\nboth your houses,” he wrote, his impartial castigation springing,\r\nperhaps, from the fact that he had lost $20,000.[668]\r\n\r\nIn January the crash came. Business houses began to fail in New York,\r\nPhiladelphia, and Washington, and by the end of the month loans could\r\nnot be had in New York and Baltimore at less than one and a half per\r\ncent discount per month. Wages decreased, along with prices, with\r\nlaborers out of employment and the real estate values on the slump. And\r\nat this time, with the Opposition in Congress working in hearty\r\ncoöperation with the Bank to create the fear that fed the panic, Jackson\r\nsat in the White House one Sunday morning writing to Hamilton: “There is\r\nno real distress. It is only with those who live by borrowing, trade on\r\nloans, and gamblers in stocks. It would be a godsend to society if all\r\nsuch were put down.... I must stop. The church bells are ringing and I\r\nmust attend.”[669] This theory that it would be a “godsend” to rid the\r\ncountry of the men who live on borrowing was to be used with\r\nconsiderable effect against Jackson by his congressional enemies.\r\n\r\nAnd at the same time, Biddle was writing to the president of his Boston\r\nbranch[670] that “the ties of party allegiance can only be broken by the\r\nactual conviction of existing distress,” and that “nothing but the\r\nevidence of suffering abroad will produce any effect in Congress”; and\r\nto Major Jack Downing in New York that “if the bank were to suffer\r\nitself to be misled into the measure of making money plentiful, it will\r\nonly give to its enemies the triumph of having robbed it with\r\nimpunity.”[671] Thus the evidence is abundant that the Bank exerted its\r\npower to the utmost to bring the country to the verge of ruin, and so\r\ncompel it to consent to a recharter. The fact that the majority of its\r\nvictims were among its most zealous supporters did not interest Mr.\r\nBiddle.[672] Two days after writing the letter to Downing, Biddle\r\ndetermined upon a further contraction in discounts to the amount of\r\n$3,320,000, with orders that this should be made within thirty or sixty\r\ndays, and the largest reductions were to be made in the Western and\r\nSouthwestern banks. Not content with this, he made another increase in\r\nthe rates of exchange, and here again discriminated frankly against the\r\nWest. Thus, in eight months the Bank planned a reduction in discounts to\r\nthe amount of $13,300,000, which Catterall describes truly as “a\r\npreposterously large sum.”[673] When to this is added the further\r\nrestrictions of as much as $5,000,000 through the breaking up of the\r\nexchange dealings of the Bank, the contraction in eight months amounted\r\nto at least $18,300,000.\r\n\r\nHad the Bank acted honorably, there would have been an inevitable\r\ndepression for the time because of the removal order, but the panic was\r\nthe Bank’s panic, deliberately conceived, and cruelly produced, with the\r\nfrankly avowed purpose of blackmailing the American people into granting\r\nanother charter. In his letter to the president of the Boston branch,\r\nBiddle had bluntly confessed his purpose. “I have no doubt,” he wrote,\r\n“that such a course will ultimately lead to a restoration of the\r\ncurrency, and the recharter of the Bank.”[674]\r\n\r\nDuring this time there were certain unscrupulous speculators, the\r\nbuzzards of the panic, whispering commendation into Biddle’s ear while\r\nfeathering their own nests through the distress of the people.[675] But\r\nWebster, alarmed at the havoc, had urged Biddle, through Horace Binney,\r\n“that the Bank ought to reduce as slowly and moderately as they can--and\r\noccasionally to ease off--where it is requisite to prevent extreme\r\nsuffering.”[676] This advice aroused the banker’s ire and resulted in no\r\ngood. It was Biddle’s idea that the Bank’s senatorial champions,\r\ninstead of suggesting a policy of moderation, should be using the\r\ndistress as an argument for a new charter. “The relief,” he wrote Joseph\r\nHopkinson, the distinguished lawyer and jurist, “to be useful or\r\npermanent, must come from Congress, and from Congress alone. If that\r\nbody will do its duty, relief will come--if not, the Bank feels no\r\nvocation to redress the wrongs of these miserable people. Rely upon\r\nthat. This worthy President thinks that because he has scalped Indians\r\nand imprisoned Judges, he is to have his way with the Bank. He is\r\nmistaken.”[677]\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Bank was encouraging, inspiring, arranging indignation\r\nmeetings of the people, where Jackson was arraigned for bringing ruin\r\nupon the community, and petitions were drawn asking for the restoration\r\nof the deposits. Clay, eager to lash the people into fury, had suggested\r\nthe plan. “It would be well,” he wrote, “to have a general meeting of\r\nthe people to memorialize Congress in favor of a restoration of the\r\ndeposits. Such an example [in Philadelphia] might be followed elsewhere;\r\nand it would be more influential as it might be more general.”[678] The\r\nartificial nature of many of the petitions was well understood by the\r\nJackson leaders, and the usually elegant John Forsyth had referred to\r\nthem in the Senate as “these pot-house memorials,” much to the\r\nastonishment of Adams.[679] These petitions, according to the plan,\r\nwere, in many instances, taken to Washington by committees that waited\r\nupon the President before presenting them to Congress. Here they were\r\npresented in lugubrious speeches calculatingly designed further to fan\r\nthe fears of the people and keep the panic going. When the New York\r\nmerchants adopted a memorial and secured the signatures of three\r\nthousand people, Tammany Hall ordered meetings in every ward in the city\r\nto approve of Jackson’s actions.[680] A few days later, between twelve\r\nand fifteen thousand friends of “sound currency by means of a national\r\nbank” met at noon in the park. When Hone, selected to preside, reached\r\nthe park, he found an “immense crowd” composed in large part “of the\r\nmost respectable mechanics and others of the city--men of character,\r\nrespectability, and personal worth, with a few miscreants who went,\r\nperhaps, of their own accord, but were probably sent there to excite\r\ndisturbances.” In truth, “the rabble had gotten possession of the\r\nchair,” and it required “some hard thumps” from the men of character,\r\nrespectability, and personal worth to clear the way sufficiently for the\r\npresiding genius of the Whig dinner table to reach the platform. When he\r\nattempted to speak, the “yells of the mob” rendered all the chairman’s\r\nefforts “unavailing”; so he “put the question upon the resolutions which\r\nwere carried by an immense majority,” and the meeting adjourned.\r\nUnhappily the “mob” did not disperse for some time afterwards.[681]\r\n\r\nWhen these committees, composed of bitter enemies of the President,\r\nbegan to pour into the capital and knock at the White House door, they\r\nwere received, at first, with urbanity and heard with patience. The\r\ncommitteemen, however, carried back “grossly colored” stories of the\r\ninterviews, and Jackson thereafter decided to hear and dismiss them\r\nwithout discussion.[682] In these stories Jackson is pictured as raving\r\nand ranting, spluttering and spouting imprecations and profanity.\r\nMcMaster, however, accepts as true that he received these committees\r\n“with that stately courtesy for which he was so justly distinguished,”\r\nand concludes from the evidence that he “soon began to lecture\r\nthem.”[683] In these lectures Jackson is reported to have told the\r\ncommittees to “go to the Bank” or to “go to Biddle” for relief. No less\r\nan authority than Catterall has concluded that he was not far wrong. On\r\none occasion he did use extreme language to a committee which implied\r\nthe threat of rebellion. “If that be your game,” he exclaimed, “come\r\nwith your armed Bank mercenaries, and, by the Eternal, I will hang you\r\naround the Capitol on gallows higher than Haman.”[684] There is no doubt\r\nthat he did harangue the committees with bitter denunciations of “The\r\nMonster” and properly ascribed a large part of the distress to the\r\ndeliberate purpose of the Bank to “discipline” the Nation. Some\r\nhistorians have suggested that these outbursts were staged, and it is\r\nrecorded as a fact by Henry A. Wise, the brilliant Virginia Whig. “When\r\na Bank committee would come ...” he writes, “he would lay down his pipe,\r\nrise to the full height of his stature and voice, and seem to foam at\r\nthe mouth whilst declaiming vehemently against the dangers of money\r\nmonopoly. The committee would retire in disgust, thinking they were\r\nleaving a mad man, and as soon as they were gone, he would resume his\r\npipe, and, chuckling, say, ‘They thought I was mad,’ and coolly comment\r\non the policy of never never compromising a vital issue.”[685] This\r\ninterpretation of Jackson’s tempests and whirlwinds of passion, coming\r\nfrom a severe critic of his Bank policy, is the most dependable of all\r\nthe opinions that have been expressed by friend or foe.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nAnd while the committees may have hooted the idea that the Bank was\r\nresponsible for the severity and continuance of the panic, it very\r\nslowly began to dawn upon the New York merchants that possibly the\r\n“Emperor Nicholas” might be able to alleviate conditions without in the\r\nleast compromising the safety of the Bank. Some of his champions were\r\nslow to realize or loath to concede this declining popularity. In\r\nFebruary the bankers and merchants of New York appointed a committee to\r\nwait upon him and urge a suspension of the contraction, and Albert\r\nGallatin, former Secretary of the Treasury, pointedly warned him that\r\nthe committee was satisfied of his ability to grant relief, and would so\r\nreport to the New York merchants. Thus cornered and threatened with the\r\ndesertion of its friends, the Bank finally agreed that up to May 1st\r\nthere should be no further contraction. This was a fatal concession in\r\nthat it was a confession that relief had been previously deliberately\r\ndenied.[686] Even such champions of the Bank as James Watson Webb found\r\nreal cause for melancholy complaint in heavy losses in Bank stock, and\r\nwe find him whining that he had lost all except his paper, and that\r\nother speculators, including Alexander Hamilton, Jr., had been among the\r\nvictims.\r\n\r\nThus the drift against the Bank, which began when Governor Wolf of\r\nPennsylvania denounced its actions in his Message to the Legislature,\r\nincreased alarmingly. The fact that the Governor had been a firm\r\nsupporter gave tremendous weight to his act. The friends of the\r\ninstitution were stunned, and, as we shall see a little later, the\r\nGovernor was bitterly denounced and warmly defended in the Senate. Thus\r\nthe advice of Jackson to “see Biddle,” so mirthfully related by the\r\ncommittees at the time, and so much ridiculed by some historians since,\r\nwas demonstrating its wisdom. One month after Wolf acted, Governor Marcy\r\nof New York imitated his example with the recommendation of a State plan\r\nof relief. His proposal to issue $6,000,000 of five per cent State stock\r\nto be loaned to State banks was adopted.\r\n\r\nThe Bank, in its game of “disciplining” the people, had vastly\r\noverplayed its hand, and, by its cruel, implacable policy of ruining\r\nfriends as well as foes, had begun to lose ground in the late winter and\r\nearly spring. Even among the ultra-conservatives of business, the\r\nfeeling was germinating that Jackson was not far wrong in the\r\nconclusion that a moneyed institution possessing the power to\r\nprecipitate panics to influence governmental action, was dangerous to\r\nthe peace, prosperity, and liberty of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nBut the politicians in the Congress were the last to see the drift. Long\r\nafter the bankers and merchants had lost interest in the fate of\r\nBiddle’s Bank, they continued their fight in its behalf throughout the\r\nmost bitter congressional session the Republic had ever known. The\r\nactions of the Bank, the tumult of the market-places, the proceedings of\r\nthe merchants, are all intimately interwoven with the activities of the\r\nBank’s champions in House and Senate. There the last stand was taken,\r\nthere the battle was definitely lost. And there the most dramatic\r\nfeature of the fight was staged. It was at this juncture that three\r\nimportant figures, not hitherto intimately identified with or against\r\nthe Administration, moved to the firing line. Thomas H. Benton assumed\r\nthe leadership of the Jacksonian forces, and Clay’s fighters were\r\nbrilliantly augmented by the advent of two Senators, William Campbell\r\nPreston of South Carolina, and Benjamin Watkins Leigh of Virginia.\r\n\r\nThe complete harmony between Benton’s views and Jackson’s actions in the\r\nBank controversy has given an overshadowing prominence to his\r\nleadership. For thirty years he was a constructive force in legislation,\r\nassociating his name with more important measures written into law than\r\nClay, Webster, and Calhoun combined. In the Senate his faults of\r\nmannerism, his arrogance, and stupendous conceit, together with the\r\ninterminable length of his speeches and his diffusive tendencies, served\r\nto overshadow his very substantial contributions to the discussions. The\r\nfact that the Chamber emptied and the galleries cleared when he arose\r\ndid not disturb him in the least. He spoke from the Chamber to the\r\ncountry, and his carefully prepared speeches, especially during the Bank\r\nfight, were treatises intended for the education of the people. His\r\npersonal life was above reproach. His austerity, his imposing dignity,\r\ndiscouraged attempts at intimacy in a day when men loved conviviality\r\nand were a trifle lax in their morals. He was one of the colossal\r\nfigures of American politics and he never loomed larger than in his\r\nfight for Jackson.\r\n\r\nWilliam C. Preston, fresh from oratorical triumphs in the Nullification\r\ncontest, entered the Senate at the age of thirty-eight. Few have made a\r\nmore favorable début in that body. His fame as an orator had preceded\r\nhim, and Clay’s plans had dedicated the panic session to perfervid\r\noratory. It is impossible to understand, from his speeches in the\r\n“Congressional Globe,” the extravagant enthusiasm of so stern a critic\r\nas Adams. But we cannot discount the common verdict of his\r\ncontemporaries who considered him one of the most consummate of orators,\r\nand “one of the greatest rhetoricians and declaimers of his\r\ngeneration.”[687] From another we learn that “many thought him the most\r\nfinished orator the South had produced,” and that he “could arouse his\r\naudiences to enthusiasm, and then move them to tears.”[688] Not least\r\namong the truimphs of his art was his power to sway a mob in the street\r\nas well as move the case-hardened critics of the Senate house. Poet and\r\npainter, as he was, it is not surprising that in the heat of advocacy\r\nhis feelings often predominated over his judgment, and his superheated\r\nimagination sometimes led him beyond the realms of reality, but these\r\nvery weaknesses were to delight the enemies of the Jackson\r\nAdministration, led to the daily assault by Clay. Thus, in his first\r\nyear in the Senate, he took his place, far in advance of most of his\r\ncolleagues, and side by side with Clay, Webster, Calhoun, and Clayton.\r\n\r\nIn addition to Preston, the Opposition was to be further strengthened\r\nby the arrival with the panic session of Leigh. Intellectually, he was\r\none of the strongest men in a State of strong men, and at the bar he was\r\nrecognized as a great constitutional and civil lawyer. As an orator, he\r\nwas fluent, fiery, intense, impressive. Wise, who was himself no mean\r\nmaster of English, has described him as “a purist in his Anglo-Saxon,”\r\nand as having a style “equal to that of the Elizabethan age of English\r\nliterature.”[689] Like Prentiss, he was a small man who loomed large\r\nwhen speaking, and, like him, too, he had one short leg and wore a cork\r\non the sole of his shoe. Unlike Prentiss, he capitalized his infirmity\r\noratorically. Wise found that, while his mannerisms were not graceful,\r\nthey “always excited sympathy for his infirmity.” His voice, which was\r\nno small part of his oratorical equipment, has been described as “clear,\r\nsoft, flute-like, not loud, but like murmuring music.”[690] His manner,\r\nhis speaking method, his very appearance, fitted in well with Clay’s\r\nprogramme of dramatic, lugubrious oratory, and he at once moved to his\r\nplace beside the panic orators, and played a conspicuous and theatrical\r\npart.\r\n\r\nThus, with the panic at its flood, with Benton moving to the front of\r\nthe Administration forces, and with Clay’s oratorical battery\r\nstrengthened, it is time to look in upon the Senate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE OF THE GODS\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nFrom the moment Congress convened, it was evident that the session was\r\nto witness the most bitter party battle ever waged. This was inevitable\r\nbecause of the realignments of the previous session, and the spirit of\r\nthe Bank. The coalition between Clay and Calhoun gave the Opposition a\r\nclear majority in the Senate. It was common gossip four days after\r\nCongress was called to order that “the understanding between Mr. Clay\r\nand Mr. Calhoun” gave the Opposition all the numerical advantage.[691]\r\nThis was thoroughly understood by Jackson, Taney, Kendall, and Blair,\r\nand all public papers regarding the removal of the deposits were\r\naccordingly framed as appeals to the people, rather than to the bodies\r\nto which they were addressed. The Presidential Message, in touching upon\r\nthis topic, was a campaign document and a challenge. Taney’s forceful\r\nreport submitting reasons for the removal was a defiance, and a clarion\r\ncall to the people in the corn rows, the villages, and the factories.\r\nThus Jackson and his friends forced the fighting from the beginning.\r\n\r\nClay led the onslaught with a resolution calling upon Taney for a report\r\non the new depositories. “I want to inquire where the Treasury of the\r\nUnited States is,” he explained ironically. The bristling Benton\r\ninstantly moved a reference to committee. The Secretary of the Treasury\r\nhad “charged the Bank distinctly with interfering with the purity of\r\nelections, with corrupting and subsidizing the press, with dishonoring\r\nits own paper and that of its branches,” and these “charges of great\r\ncriminality” should be investigated. Affecting to ignore Benton, Clay\r\nfollowed with another resolution calling upon the President to say\r\nwhether the Paper, “alleged” to have been read to the Cabinet, was\r\ngenuine, and if so, to lay a copy before the Senate. This was a stupid\r\ntactical blunder, and John Forsyth, with his suave courtesy, which was\r\nnot always as innocent as it seemed, inquired the purpose of the\r\n“unusual” call. Clay’s reply was a quibble. The Paper had been published\r\nas having been read by the President, and even promulgated through the\r\npress, and he, for one, refused to assume that it was genuine.\r\n\r\n“If I understand the gentleman from Kentucky,” pressed the courtly\r\nForsyth, “he admits that with the intercourse between the President and\r\nhis Cabinet we have nothing to do.”\r\n\r\n“I make no admission,” snapped Clay.\r\n\r\nIt was then that Forsyth revealed the theory on which the Administration\r\nforces were to proceed. Why could not Clay indicate the purpose which\r\nimpelled him? he asked. Was it for the purpose of impeachment? Then the\r\ncall should have originated in the House, not the Senate. “When the\r\nPresident should be brought to our bar, and put on trial for his\r\nviolation of the Constitution, that paper would be produced in support\r\nof the charge,” he continued. But why should the Senate call for it? It\r\nwas accessible for all purposes of argument. He could understand the\r\nresolution only “as a desire to prompt the other House to proceedings by\r\nimpeachment, and to condemn the President in advance.” But after Clay\r\nhad reiterated the absurd explanation that he merely sought authentic\r\nverification of the genuineness of the Paper, the resolution was\r\nadopted.[692] The response of Jackson was immediately made in a\r\ndignified and unanswerable note of refusal. “As well might I be required\r\nto detail to the Senate the free and private conversations I have held\r\nwith those officers on any subject relating to their duties,” he\r\nsaid.[693] It was a sharp rebuke, richly merited, and left Clay in an\r\nunenviable position.\r\n\r\nThe next brush came in the prompt rejection by the Senate of the\r\nnominations of the Government directors who had furnished the report on\r\nwhich Jackson had based his charge of wrongdoing. The moment their names\r\nwere sent to the Senate, Biddle began to deluge his senatorial friends\r\nwith demands for their rejection. “They are unfit to be there [on the\r\nboard],” he wrote Webster; “unfit to associate with the other\r\nmembers.”[694] In the Bank circles they were denounced as “spies,” and\r\nthus, in response to the demand of Biddle, they were rejected. Such was\r\nthe intimacy of the relation between the party of the Opposition and the\r\nBank of the United States. The sinister nature of this relationship is\r\npainfully illustrated in the case of Daniel Webster, who, two weeks\r\nafter the opening of the session, had written Biddle of his rejection of\r\na professional employment against the Bank, with the bald suggestion\r\nthat “I believe my retainer has not been renewed or refreshed as usual,”\r\nand that “if it be wished that my relation to the Bank should be\r\ncontinued, it may be well to send me the usual retainers.”[695]\r\n\r\nThus the first days of the session were passed in maneuvering for\r\nposition, with frequent incidents of a petty nature indicative of the\r\nrancorous party spirit of the times. Having observed the unobtrusive\r\nfigure of Major Lewis, that most consummate of politicians and\r\npresidential reporters, moving about the floor of the House, Richard\r\nHenry Wilde, poet and politician, Nullifier and Whig, framed a\r\nresolution to exclude him, but it was defeated.[696] Meanwhile Clay was\r\nbusy mapping his campaign, preparing the resolutions on which he\r\nproposed to make the issue. The Opposition leaders were clearly\r\nembarrassed in determining their course of action. Webster appealed to\r\nJustice Story, the scholarly associate of John Marshall, for an opinion\r\non the legal phases; and writing from Cambridge that great jurist would\r\nnot advise that the deposits could not be legally withdrawn unless\r\ndanger to their security was involved, but he advanced the theory on\r\nwhich the Bank champions acted--that the Secretary of the Treasury did\r\nnot become custodian of the funds by virtue of his position in the\r\nCabinet, but held them as a “personal trust, and as much so as if\r\nconfided to the Chief Justice of the United States.” Thus he furnished\r\nthe Opposition with the opinion it required. The President had no right\r\nto interfere; more--if he did interfere, and the Secretary submitted\r\nagainst his own judgment, he violated his trust; and the State banks had\r\nno proper authority to take over the deposits.[697] Unhappily, the\r\nlearned jurist failed to take the next necessary step, and conclude that\r\nthe President had no power to remove a Secretary of the Treasury.\r\n\r\nAnd it was just this queer opinion that Clay was zealously seeking.\r\nAbout the time Webster was appealing to Story for the elucidation of\r\nlegal points, Clay was writing to former Senator Tazewell at Norfolk, a\r\ngreat constitutional lawyer, inquiring as to whether or not Jackson had\r\ntranscended his power in dismissing Duane. It must have been with some\r\nembarrassment that he read the Virginian’s reply, that to him it was\r\n“manifestly absurd to regard the President as responsible for the acts\r\nof subordinate agents, and yet to deny him the uncontrolled power of\r\nsupervising them, and removing them from office whenever they had lost\r\nhis confidence.”[698] This opinion, however, did not deter some\r\nstatesmen from advancing the idea that Tazewell had contemptuously\r\nrejected.\r\n\r\nBut the position of Story was accepted, and Clay submitted his\r\nresolutions censuring the President, and holding the reasons given by\r\nTaney for the removal “unsatisfactory and insufficient.” Thus the decks\r\nwere cleared for action. The real fight began in the debate that day\r\nupon these resolutions, and upon these, and others growing out of them,\r\nthe verbal battle, which at times threatened to be other than bloodless,\r\nraged with intemperate fury for seven months.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nNever up to that time, nor again for more than a generation, did\r\nCongress so completely hold the interest of the country. The great\r\norators of the Opposition never shone with greater luster, and by their\r\nimpassioned eloquence, and not a little of consummate histrionics, they\r\npersuaded their followers, if not themselves, that they were actually\r\nfighting the battle of liberty against despotism. The Democrats\r\ncontended, on the defensive, that Jackson had the right to dismiss\r\nDuane, and that Taney had the legal right to order the removal.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that the little city of Washington, with all its\r\ninterests revolving about the performances at the Capitol, should have\r\npoured forth its people daily to pack the galleries and crowd the\r\nlobbies. The Senate Chamber became the peacock alley of fashion--they\r\nwho met at the dinner or the dance the night before mingled there in the\r\nday-time. The debate drew many from other sections, and the belles of\r\ncountry places and remote towns helped to crowd the Chamber to\r\nsuffocation.[699] In the fashionable character of the gallery audiences\r\nwe catch the hostility of the aristocracy to the President and his\r\nparty. The distress committees with their petitions were wont to pack\r\nthe galleries “applauding the speakers against the President--saluting\r\nwith noise and confusion those who spoke on his side.”[700] Confirmation\r\nof such scenes are to be found in the official report of the\r\nproceedings.[701] It has been the fashion to refer to the Jacksonians as\r\nthe “rabble” and the “mob,” and as partaking of the nature of the\r\nJacobins, but throughout the Bank fight the “mob” in the galleries,\r\nresorting to the Jacobin methods of hissing and cheering the proceedings\r\non the floor, were largely confined to the enemies of the President.\r\n\r\nThe debate on the Clay resolutions had scarcely begun when the daily\r\narrival of distress petitions furnished a diversion in the Senate. The\r\nmemorials were lugubrious recitals of wreck and ruin, and pathetic\r\nappeals for the restoration of the deposits. Frequently presented by\r\ncommittees, the bearers repaired to the gallery to give sympathetic ear\r\nto the mournful speeches of the Senators to whom their petitions had\r\nbeen entrusted. There was a marked similarity in the petitions, and an\r\neven more striking resemblance in the speeches. The burden of both was\r\nthat the happiness of a prosperous community had been struck down by a\r\ntyrant, and that nothing but the restoration of the deposits could end\r\nthe agony. That the action of such men as Clay, Webster, and Calhoun, in\r\npicturing in lurid and exaggerated colors the distress of the moment,\r\nand predicting even greater calamities, was calculated to frighten the\r\ntimid and create panic must have been understood by them. At any rate,\r\nthese petitions were part of the leaders’ plan.[702] This phase of the\r\nfight developed with the presentation of Clay’s resolution to “inquire\r\ninto the expediency of affording temporary relief to the community from\r\nthe present pecuniary embarrassments by prolonging the payment of\r\nrevenue bonds as they fall due.” This resolution opened the way for\r\nClay’s first “distress speech.” And Forsyth, who was something of a\r\ncynic in his way, saw no objection to the resolution, provided it were\r\namended by instructing the committee “to inquire into the extent and\r\ncauses of the alleged distress of the community, and into the propriety\r\nof legislative interference to relieve them.” The proposal of the\r\namendment gave Forsyth the opportunity to present the Administration’s\r\nopinion of the panic. He had no doubt that there was distress, but it\r\nhad been greatly exaggerated. “Whence does it arise?” he asked. “From\r\nthe conflict--the war that the Bank is waging to get the deposits back.\r\nThe deposits have been removed. The Bank stands still to see what will\r\nfollow, and it stands still, too, that its power may be felt in every\r\nnerve and fiber of the community--and every man shall feel the necessity\r\nof the institution.”[703]\r\n\r\nThus the panic speeches began. “There sits Mr. Biddle,” rather stupidly\r\nexclaimed one Senator, presenting a petition, “in the presidency of the\r\nBank, as calm as a summer’s morning, with his directors around him,\r\nreceiving his salary, with everything moving on harmoniously; and has\r\nthis strike reached him? No, sir. The blow has fallen on the friends of\r\nthe President and the country.”[704] Thus did one Opposition leader\r\nrejoice in the serenity of the Bank and its president in the midst of\r\nthe distress of his country.\r\n\r\nVery early the friends of the Administration took their cue from its\r\nenemies, and began to flood the Senate with memorials against the Bank.\r\nThus day by day the proceedings were opened by the reading of petitions,\r\nfollowed by speeches on the “distress,” and replies belittling the\r\npanic. Mr. Clay’s heart was wrung by news of the distress in Savannah\r\nand Augusta; whereupon Mr. Forsyth rose to deny that there was distress\r\nin those cities. “I know the individuals,” he said. “They are highly\r\nrespectable men--merchants and members of the Bar. They are friends of\r\nthe Bank of the United States.”[705] A New Jersey Senator, opposed to\r\nthe Administration, presented conflicting petitions from his State, with\r\nthe Jackson petitions numerically the stronger. Ah, laughed Forsyth,\r\n“from the State of New Jersey we have three cheers for one groan.”[706]\r\nWhen an Opposition Senator presented a petition from Portsmouth with a\r\ndoleful tale, Senator Isaac Hill killed the effect by explaining the\r\ndubious manner in which the signatures had been obtained. And when, a\r\nlittle later, Hill undertook to present a petition of the New Hampshire\r\nLegislature against the Bank, Webster moved to lay it on the table. In\r\ntruth the actions of legislatures were beginning to annoy the\r\npanic-breeders. Maine, New York, New Hampshire, and other States had\r\nspoken in support of Jackson’s policy. It became necessary to devote\r\nmore attention to that end of the petition business. “What is doing in\r\nyour legislature about the deposits?” Clay wrote to his friend, Judge\r\nBrooke of Virginia. “We want all aid here on that subject which can be\r\ngiven us from Richmond.”[707] And when the Legislature acted, John Tyler\r\nlost all patience with the Governor for not sending the petition on at\r\nonce. “The resolutions of the legislature have not yet reached me,” he\r\nwrote impatiently to Mrs. Tyler, “nor can I conceive what Floyd is after\r\nthat he does not forward them.”[708] They arrived in time, and Webster\r\ndid not move to lay them on the table.\r\n\r\nThen, with the effect of a bomb exploding among the Bank champions, came\r\nthe message of Governor Wolf of Pennsylvania, denouncing the Bank for\r\nresponsibility for the depression. Clay lost no time in denouncing him\r\nas a man worshiper, albeit the Governor had previously favored the Bank.\r\nAnother Bank Senator rushed forward with a resolution “disapproving the\r\nvacillating or time-serving policy of the Governor of Pennsylvania,”\r\nwhile Forsyth and others criticized the taste of the proceedings.[709]\r\n\r\nThus the battle of the petitions went merrily on, some spontaneous, most\r\ninspired by the Bank agents, while the conflicting memorials were\r\nconceived to offset the intended effect. As the weeks extended into\r\nmonths, and the depression began to lift, extraordinary efforts were\r\nmade to reawaken the country against the “tyrant in the White House.”\r\nWebster harangued a crowd in New York City; but the major part of the\r\nplatform propaganda work was assigned to McDuffie, who better than most\r\nmen knew how to “ride on the whirlwind and direct the storm”; to\r\nPreston, who could arouse men to frenzy or move them to tears; and to\r\nPoindexter, who was a veritable fire-eater. These three consummate\r\nmob-baiters set forth on a journey that took them to Baltimore,\r\nPhiladelphia, and New York. The orators reached Baltimore on Sunday. But\r\nno matter; as a minister of the Gospel piously said, “in revolutionary\r\ntimes there were no Sabbaths,” and the meeting was held. It was on this\r\noccasion that McDuffie, with the true spirit of the demagogue, solemnly\r\ndiscussed the “rumor” that Jackson, the tyrant, might attempt to dismiss\r\nCongress at the point of the bayonet, and promised that “ten days after\r\nthe entrance of the soldiers into the Senate Chamber, to send the\r\nSenators home, 200,000 volunteers would be in Washington.”[710]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Kitchen Cabinet was capitalizing all the intemperate\r\nattacks upon Jackson, and Blair was publishing letters in the “Globe”\r\nthreatening the life of the President if he did not restore the\r\ndeposits. One of these recited that three young men in New York had been\r\nselected to “proceed in the course of the present month to the capital,\r\nthere to put in execution the design entrusted to their hands.”[711]\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nSuch, however, were the side issues of the session. The real fight was\r\nwaged on Clay’s resolutions to censure, and later on the President’s\r\nProtest. Clay opened the debate on the censure resolutions in a\r\nthree-days speech bristling with extravagant invective--a tremendous\r\nphilippic, not only against Jackson’s Bank policy, but against his\r\nentire presidential career. Intended to serve outside the Senate Chamber\r\nin alarming the people, his appeal was to the passions and the fears of\r\nthe multitude. The central idea of it all was that all power was being\r\nconcentrated in one man. The constitutional rights of the Senate had\r\nbeen outraged. The public domain was threatened with sacrifice. The\r\nIndian tribes had been miserably wronged. Even the tariff was in danger.\r\nAn “elective monarchy” was all but established. On every hand was\r\ndepression, suffering, gloom. The power over the purse had been lodged\r\nwith that over the sword--a combination fatal to free government. The\r\nPresident’s conduct had been lawless. Such, in brief, was the tone and\r\ntemper of one of the greatest philippics that ever poured from the lips\r\nof Clay.[712] As he sank into his seat, Benton instantly began his\r\nthree-days reply, meeting the attack with a counter-offensive. “Who are\r\nthese Goths?” he demanded--referring to Clay’s call upon the people to\r\ndrive the Goths from the Capitol. “They are President Jackson and the\r\nDemocratic Party--he just elected President over the Senator himself,\r\nand the party just been made a majority in the House--all by the votes\r\nof the people. It is their act which has placed these Goths in\r\npossession of the Capitol to the discomfiture of the Senator and his\r\nfriends.”\r\n\r\nCalhoun followed in a speech of an hour and a half in support of the\r\nresolutions, proclaiming the coalition. “The Senator from Kentucky\r\nanticipates with confidence,” he said, “that the small party who were\r\ndenounced at the last session as traitors and disunionists will be found\r\non this trying occasion in the front rank, and manfully resisting the\r\nadvance of despotic power.” But Calhoun’s intellectual self-respect\r\ndeterred him from contending that the removal of Duane was an act of\r\nExecutive usurpation.\r\n\r\nThen followed Rives in a manly defense of the Administration which he\r\nwell knew would force his retirement from the Senate under the\r\ninstructions of the Virginia Legislature. And then the new orator of the\r\nOpposition, William Campbell Preston, entered the lists, attacking\r\nGovernment directors for furnishing the President with a report of the\r\nBank’s activities. The President had no right to ask information, and\r\nthe directors no right to comply. The galleries were moved to applause,\r\nand the Carolinian took his place among the popular orators of the\r\nday.[713] Forsyth followed Preston, to be succeeded by Grundy, who was\r\ntrailed by Frelinghuysen for the resolutions.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Webster was impressively silent. Unwilling longer to make the\r\nBank the football of party politics, he looked disapprovingly upon the\r\nwar of personalities. He knew that no constructive measure had been\r\nproposed, and that Biddle’s frenzied pressure on the people was driving\r\nsupporters from the institution. He had no heart at this time for an\r\nattack on Jackson--recalling the “reciprocal kindnesses” of the last few\r\nmonths.[714] He realized that a senatorial censure and exterior pressure\r\nwould never drive Jackson to such a recharter measure as had been\r\nproposed. And yet, in January, Calhoun was positive that the\r\nAdministration had been mortally wounded.[715] Preston was exuberantly\r\nproclaiming that the removal of the deposits would force a recharter on\r\nthe Bank’s terms.[716] In February, when the Bank was losing ground with\r\nthe people and making no congressional converts, Clay was writing to\r\nBrooke that “we are gaining, both in public opinion and in number in the\r\nHouse of Representatives.”[717] That Clay was supremely selfish in his\r\nrelations with the Bank is generally conceded by historians now,[718]\r\nand was keenly felt even by Biddle, who preferred a joint resolution\r\nordering the restoration to wasting months in wrangling over a vote of\r\ncensure. This plan he urged upon Webster, through Horace Binney of the\r\nHouse. But Clay scoffed at the idea. He was more interested in making\r\nJackson obnoxious for party reasons than in serving his friends in\r\nPhiladelphia, and he actually felt that he was succeeding in his\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nAt length Webster determined to strike out for himself.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nEarly in March he came forward with his compromise recharter measure\r\nproviding a renewal for six years only; for an abandonment of the\r\nmonopoly features to the end that Congress might, in the meantime, if it\r\nsaw fit, grant a charter to another company; for the restoration of the\r\ndeposits only after July 1st; and for the issuance of no note under the\r\n$20 denomination. This compromise had been discussed with friends of the\r\nAdministration, who were ready to support it provided the friends of the\r\nBank would unite upon it. Three days later Webster addressed the Senate\r\non the virtues and purposes of the measure, carefully refraining from\r\npersonalities or denunciation of the President. The most militant of\r\nJackson’s friends could have found no fault with the orator’s treatment\r\nof their idol. Nor did he imitate his party colleagues in an intemperate\r\ndiscussion of the removal. He traced the origin of the distress to\r\nTaney’s order; showed the relation between commerce and credit, and\r\nbetween credit and banking, and effectively disposed of Jackson’s\r\nfallacy that men who operate on credit are undeserving of consideration.\r\nIt was only in his affectation of indignation over the charge that the\r\nBank was deliberately contributing to the distress that he departed from\r\nthe high ground of statesmanship, and played the hypocritical\r\npolitician. But the Senators listening eagerly to his words did not know\r\nof the letter he had written to Biddle predicting that the\r\n“disciplining” of the people would result in a renewal of the charter,\r\nor that he had urged upon Biddle, through Binney, that he ought to\r\n“occasionally ease off, where it is requisite to prevent extreme\r\ndistress.” No one knew better than he that the Bank not only possessed,\r\nbut exerted, the power charged by the Administration. This aside,\r\nWebster’s was the most dignified, impersonal, and statesmanlike speech\r\nof the session.\r\n\r\nBut the moment he resumed his seat, the schism among the leaders of the\r\nOpposition was emphasized when Leigh arose to announce that the Virginia\r\nview of the unconstitutionality of the Bank would make it impossible for\r\nhim to support the bill. Three days later Calhoun criticized the measure\r\nas only a temporary expedient, and proposed, instead, a bill of his own\r\nproviding a recharter for twelve years. The only extensive attack on the\r\nWebster compromise, however, was that of the “Cato of the Senate,” Hugh\r\nLawson White, who had not up to that time wholly broken with his old\r\nfriend in the White House. Respected as a financier, he was always heard\r\nwith profound respect. He vigorously defended the removal of the\r\ndeposits on the grounds set forth in Jackson’s Message. His speech was\r\nall the more impressive because he had advised against the removal and\r\nhis letter had been read to the Cabinet. The day before taking the\r\nfloor, he wrote of his embarrassment, but later developments having\r\nchanged his opinion, he felt it would be censurable to remain\r\nsilent.[719]\r\n\r\nBut in the end it was not the opposition of Democratic Senators that\r\nsuddenly terminated the consideration of the Webster compromise. It was\r\nsoon found that the friends of the Bank were hopelessly divided on any\r\nconstructive programme. Even in the inner Bank circles there were\r\nclashing views. Biddle favored the Webster plan; Sergeant, the chief\r\ncounsel, and Binney, leading spokesman in the House, preferred the\r\nCalhoun measure. Even these differences might have been reconciled but\r\nfor the selfishness of Clay, who persisted in his determination to use\r\nthe Bank for party purposes. “If Mr. C [Clay] and Mr. C [Calhoun] would\r\ngo along with us,” Webster wrote Biddle, “we could carry the compromise\r\nbill through the Senate by a strong two thirds majority. Can you write\r\nthrough anybody to talk with Mr. Calhoun?”[720] In the meanwhile Calhoun\r\nwas attempting the conversion of such Administration Senators as Benton\r\nand Silas Wright, without success.\r\n\r\nWhile these negotiations were in progress, the fury of Clay over the\r\nindependence of Webster increased in intensity, culminating in the\r\nthreat that, if the New Englander failed to move to lay his own motion\r\non the table, he would make the motion himself. Thus, one week after the\r\ndelivery of his speech, Webster killed his own measure. When, with the\r\nexplanation that he had been disappointed in his hopes, he made the\r\nmotion to table, John Forsyth demanded the yeas and nays to show that\r\nWebster’s bill had not been killed by the Administration Senators, but\r\nby his own party friends. The roll-call showed practically all the Bank\r\nSenators voting to table, with Benton, Forsyth, White, Hill, Wright, and\r\nGrundy voting against the motion. Thus the only practical and\r\nconstructive attempt made by the friends of the Bank to save the\r\ninstitution was slaughtered in the house of its friends.[721]\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nWith the accumulating evidence of impatience in the country, Clay at\r\nlength determined to bring to a vote the resolutions, submitted merely\r\nto irritate and provoke a debate that would give the panic time to act.\r\nSo firmly was Clay convinced that the “disciplining” of the people was\r\nworking the destruction of Jackson’s popularity, that he sought to\r\ntransfer a portion of his fancied resentment to Van Buren, who was all\r\nbut certain to be the Democratic nominee in 1836.[722] There has\r\nprobably never been a more transparent bit of histrionics perpetrated\r\nupon a deliberative body than that of Clay in his pathetic appeal to Van\r\nBuren, seated in the chair, and with a padlock on his lips, to hasten to\r\nJackson with a plea for the suffering people.\r\n\r\n“To you, sir, in no unfriendly spirit, but with feelings softened and\r\nsubdued by the deep distress which pervades every class of our\r\ncountrymen, I make this appeal,” he exclaimed, his eyes moist with\r\ntears. “...Depict to him, if you can find language to portray, the\r\nheartrending wretchedness of thousands of the working classes cast out\r\nof employment. Tell him of the tears of helpless widows, no longer able\r\nto earn their bread, and of unclad and unfed orphans, who have been\r\ndriven by this policy, out of the busy pursuits, in which, but\r\nyesterday, they were gaining an honest livelihood.... Tell him that he\r\nhas been abused, deceived, betrayed by the wicked counsels of\r\nunprincipled men around him. Inform him that all efforts in Congress to\r\nalleviate or terminate the public distress are paralyzed and likely to\r\nprove totally unavailing, from his influence upon a large portion of its\r\nmembers who are unwilling to withdraw their support, or to take a course\r\nrepugnant to his wishes and feelings. Tell him that in his bosom alone,\r\nunder actual circumstances, does the power reside to relieve the\r\ncountry; and that unless he opens it to conviction, and corrects the\r\nerrors of his Administration, no human imagination can conceive, and no\r\nhuman tongue can express the awful consequences which may follow.”\r\n\r\nWith this piece of play-acting, Clay, looking as much distressed as one\r\nof his petitioners, sank exhausted in his seat. Throughout the ludicrous\r\nscene, Van Buren “maintained the utmost decorum of countenance, looking\r\nrespectfully and even innocently at the speaker all the while as if\r\ntreasuring up every word he said to be repeated to the President.”[723]\r\nBut all the while the more astute Red Fox was thinking that the speech\r\n“would tend to strengthen greatly the attachment of his friends; would\r\nwarm up their sympathies in his behalf and concentrate their\r\nregard.”[724] With the eyes of all upon him--and the Senate had been\r\nreally affected by Clay’s voice and manner--Van Buren called a Senator\r\nto the chair, placidly descended to the floor as though he were not the\r\nobject of interest, deliberately walked to Clay’s seat, and, in his most\r\ncourtly manner, and with his most courtly bow, asked for a pinch of his\r\nsnuff. The startled orator gave him his snuffbox. Van Buren took a\r\npinch, applied it to his nostrils, returned the box, bowed again, and\r\nresumed the chair as though nothing had happened. And the Senate smiled.\r\nClay’s appeal had hovered dangerously near the ridiculous, and Van Buren\r\npushed it over. No single incident so well illustrates the political\r\npurpose of Clay’s activities on the removal of the deposits.\r\n\r\nBut even panics and politics cannot go on forever, and the discussion on\r\nthe Clay resolutions had covered “the longest period which had been\r\noccupied in a single debate in either House of Congress since the\r\norganization of the Government.”[725] Thus, on March 27th the Senate, by\r\na vote of 26 to 20, placed the stigma of a censure upon the action of\r\nthe President.\r\n\r\nJackson was now to have his inning.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nWith mass meetings being organized against him in all sections, with the\r\ncapital crowded with hostile delegations, and with the Senators\r\nthundering their extravagant philippics at the tyrant responsible for\r\nthe widows’ and the orphans’ woes, Jackson remained serene and\r\nunafraid.[726] But with the adoption of the resolutions of censure, he\r\ndetermined to strike back in such a way as effectively to reach the\r\npeople. There were men in those days who thought that a senatorial\r\ncensure would wreck any reputation. They had not yet sensed the spirit\r\nof the times. Three weeks after the Senate acted, Major Donelson\r\nappeared in the Chamber with the famous Protest. Nothing could have been\r\nmore merciless than the cold logic with which the iron man pounded the\r\nresolutions of condemnation; nothing more biting than his reference to\r\nthose Senators supporting them, who had thus “deliberately disregarded\r\nthe recorded opinion of their States.” He solemnly protested “against\r\nthe proceedings ... as unauthorized by the Constitution, contrary to the\r\nspirit and to several of its express provisions, subversive of that\r\ndistribution of powers of government which it has ordained and\r\nestablished, destructive of the checks and safeguards by which those\r\npowers were intended on the one hand to be controlled and on the other\r\nto be protected, and calculated, by their immediate and collateral\r\neffects, by their character and tendency, to concentrate in the hands of\r\na body, not directly amenable to the people, a degree of influence and\r\npower dangerous to their liberties and fatal to the Constitution of\r\ntheir choice.”\r\n\r\nNot only had his public character been assailed, but imputations had\r\nbeen cast upon his private character. “In vain do I bear upon my\r\nperson,” he continued in a passage of no little eloquence, “enduring\r\nmemorials of that contest in which American liberty was purchased; in\r\nvain have I since periled property, fame, and life in defense of the\r\nrights and privileges so dearly bought; in vain am I now, without a\r\npersonal aspiration or the hope of individual advantage, encountering\r\nresponsibilities and dangers from which by mere inactivity in relation\r\nto a single point I might have been exempt, if any serious doubts can be\r\nentertained as to the purity of my purpose and motives. If I had been\r\nambitious, I should have sought an alliance with that powerful\r\ninstitution which even now aspires to no divided empire. If I had been\r\nvenal, I should have sold myself to its designs. Had I preferred\r\npersonal comfort and official ease to the performance of my arduous\r\nduty, I should have ceased to molest it. In the history of conquerors\r\nand usurpers, never in the fire of youth nor in the vigor of manhood\r\ncould I find an attraction to lure me from the path of duty, and now I\r\nshall scarcely find an inducement to commence the career of ambition\r\nwhen gray hairs and a decaying frame, instead of inviting to toil and\r\nbattle, call me to the contemplation of other worlds where conquerors\r\ncease to be honored and usurpers expiate their crimes.” And he closed\r\nwith the request that the Protest be entered upon the journals of the\r\nSenate.[727]\r\n\r\nWhatever else may be said of this remarkable document, its effect upon\r\nthe masses of the people, idolizing Jackson as they never had another\r\nAmerican, was certain to be tremendous. The ideas were largely\r\nJackson’s. Attorney-General Butler, a brilliant lawyer, worked out the\r\nlegal end, while Amos Kendall devoted his genius to those portions\r\nintended for political effect. The Protest appeared immediately in\r\nBlair’s “Globe,” and was soon published in all the Administration papers\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nThe effect on the Senate may be better imagined than described.\r\nPoindexter, whose private grudge was the inspiration of his renegadism,\r\ncould not “express the feeling of indignation” the paper had excited in\r\nhis bosom, and he would “spurn it from the Senate”--“that body which\r\nstands as a barrier between the people and the encroachments of\r\nexecutive power.” It was not a Message--merely “a paper, signed ‘Andrew\r\nJackson,’” and “nothing else.”[728] Sprague of Maine, who had been\r\npilloried, spoke “more in grief than in anger,” and while the President\r\nhad referred to “his Secretary” and felt that this was “his Government,”\r\nhe, the Senator, “never bowed the knee to Baal.” And while the tyrant\r\nwas appealing to the people, look about. “Behold your green fields\r\nwithered; listen to the cries of distress of the widows and orphans,\r\nrising almost in execration of the exercise of that power which has\r\nblasted their hopes and reduced them to despair.”[729] Frelinghuysen of\r\nNew Jersey, another pilloried statesman, next arose to discuss “this\r\nmost extraordinary proceeding--one which would form an era in American\r\nhistory.” What a spectacle! “When the busy hum of industry was silenced,\r\nwhen the laborer was in want of employment, when banks were breaking in\r\nevery direction, and the cries for relief from the unrelenting hand of\r\npower were heard everywhere around us,” the Senate had listened to a\r\nlecture of an hour and a half. And why refer to the New Jersey\r\nLegislature? He had “dared to meet the frowns of his constituents”\r\nbecause of his zeal for his country.[730] Southard of New Jersey, also\r\npilloried by Jackson, hoped that he might “school himself into that\r\ndegree of moderation necessary for the occasion.” He could find no\r\nexcuse for Jackson’s indignation. And yet “we have received, not from\r\nCharles I, Cromwell, or Napoleon Bonaparte, but from a man combining the\r\ncharacters of the whole of them, a warning to cease our further\r\nproceedings.”[731] And Leigh closed the day’s events by declaring\r\n“before God that upon the fate of these resolutions, and the disposition\r\nof this question, depends the permanency of the Constitution, handed\r\ndown to us by our fathers.”[732]\r\n\r\nTo get the right perspective upon these speeches, it should be borne in\r\nmind that at the time of their delivery the business men were openly\r\ncharging Biddle with responsibility for the panic. Niles’s “Register”\r\nhad admitted that the Bank’s power was too great, and the “St. Louis\r\nRepublican,” a stanch supporter of the Bank, had turned upon it with a\r\nbitter denunciation of its course.[733] Thus, however, the debate began,\r\nand in this spirit was it continued for a month--a month of fierce\r\ninvective. On the second day, following the philippic of Leigh, the\r\ncrowds in the packed galleries clashed with cheers and hisses.\r\nEspecially pleased were the galleries when, apropos of Jackson’s\r\nreference to his gray hairs, the fiery cripple compared him to Mount\r\nÆtna, “whose summit was capped with eternal snow, but which was always\r\nvomiting forth its liquid fire.”[734] The discussion finally revolved\r\naround the Poindexter resolutions not to receive. A few days later\r\nCalhoun attacked the Protest with great bitterness, and amendments were\r\noffered by both Calhoun and Forsyth. That of the Carolinian declared the\r\nPresident had no right to send, and the Senate no right to receive, such\r\na document. Then the Administration disclosed its hand in the Forsyth\r\nresolution providing that “an authenticated copy of the original\r\nresolution [Clay’s] with a list of the ayes and nays, of the President’s\r\nMessage and the pending resolution be prepared ... and transmitted to\r\nthe Governor of each State of the Union to be laid before their\r\nlegislature at the next session, as the only authority authorized to\r\ndecide upon the opinions and conduct of the Senators.”[735] Here was a\r\ndeclaration, by indirection, from the leader of the Administration that\r\nthe President was not authorized to pass upon the opinions and conduct\r\nof Senators. Had the resolution stopped there, it would not have\r\ndiffered materially from those of Poindexter or the resolution of\r\nCalhoun. But it declared that there was an authority to pass upon the\r\nconduct of Senators--the people who elected them to the Senate; and\r\nthat, with the facts before them, they should pass upon the conduct of\r\nthe public servants. This was an impressive proclamation that the\r\nJacksonian Senators were convinced that the people sustained them; and\r\nthe fact that the Forsyth resolution was defeated by a party vote was an\r\nadmission from the Opposition that it lacked such faith.\r\n\r\nWhen in early May the Poindexter resolutions were called up for final\r\nconsideration, the debate was closed by Webster in a constitutional\r\nargument pitched upon a higher plane than that of personalities, and\r\ninterspersed with passages of eloquence seldom equaled even by him.[736]\r\nNothing reveals the inability of the senatorial oligarchy to understand\r\nthe altered spirit of the people so well as his contention that the\r\nSenate was expected to stand between the people and the tyranny of\r\nExecutive power. The fact that the peaceful revolution of 1828 was a\r\nrising of the people against the aristocracy of the old congressional\r\nclique does not appear to have occurred to Webster or his party friends\r\nat any time during the Jacksonian period.\r\n\r\nWhen Webster concluded, the last word for the Administration was spoken\r\nby its most eloquent spokesman, who, better than any other, was\r\ntemperamentally fitted to meet the New England orator upon the high\r\nplane he had chosen, John Forsyth. Webster rejoined, briefly, the vote\r\nwas taken, and the resolutions passed with a margin of eleven votes.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the battle over the deposits was being fought in the House,\r\nalbeit with less vituperation and abuse. John Quincy Adams, one of the\r\nBank’s leaders, looked upon the proceedings in both Houses with cynical\r\namusement as being the mere ebullitions of party politics with no\r\nterminal facilities. Though a talkative member, his name appearing\r\nninety-three times during the session, he made none of the principal\r\nspeeches on the leading questions; but whenever his vote was required,\r\nit was cast for the Bank, and whenever his advice was solicited, it was\r\ngiven. The more active leadership of the tempestuous McDuffie, whose\r\npartiality for the Bank had displaced him in the chairmanship of the\r\nWays and Means Committee, was more in evidence. But more impressive than\r\neither in the front rank of the Bank champions was a new member whose\r\nextraordinary ability placed him immediately with the foremost of\r\ncongressional orators. When Horace Binney entered the House, he was in\r\nhis fifty-third year, at the height of his forensic fame, and at the\r\nhead of the Philadelphia Bar. He was, perhaps, the sole figure among the\r\nBank leaders in House or Senate who was not moved in the slightest\r\ndegree by political considerations. He had overcome his distaste for\r\npolitical controversy and entered the House with the sole purpose of\r\nprotecting, as best he could, the interest of the institution of which\r\nhe had, but the year before, become a director. He was as much the\r\nattorney and special pleader of the Bank in the House as he could have\r\nbeen in the courts. His physical appearance alone would have\r\ndistinguished him in any assembly. Tall, large, and perfectly\r\nproportioned, he has been described by one who observed him during the\r\nBank fight as “an Apollo in manly beauty.”[737] As an orator he was of\r\nthe Websterian mould. He spoke with great deliberation, and with perfect\r\nenunciation and modulation with a voice that was full and musical.\r\nUnlike McDuffie, he was incapable of tearing a passion to tatters. Never\r\nnoisy, even in moments of great excitement, he was always graceful and\r\neasy in his manner. He spoke the language that Addison and Swift wrote.\r\nHe addressed the House with the same scrupulous care and the same lofty\r\ndignity with which he would have addressed John Marshall on the Supreme\r\nBench, or conversed with Mrs. Livingston in her drawing-room. In social\r\nrelationships, his innate refinement could not be marred by the\r\nfree-and-easy manners of the cloak-room; his suavity could not be\r\ndisturbed by the ferocity of attack; his dignity could withstand any\r\ncircumstance. Such was the Bank’s most perfect champion in its greatest\r\ncrisis. He left his profession to serve its cause, and that cause\r\ndefeated, he gladly bade farewell to public life and returned to his\r\nprofession and his habitual peace of mind.\r\n\r\nAs chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, the burden of the battle\r\nfor the Administration fell on James K. Polk. History has settled on the\r\nverdict that he was a man of mediocre ability, with nothing to commend\r\nhim to the admiration, and little to the respect, of posterity. But he\r\nmanaged the fight for the Administration with consummate parliamentary\r\nskill. Beset on all sides by tremendous onslaughts, he remained cool,\r\ncourteous, and fair throughout, and won the open commendation of\r\nMcDuffie for the manliness of his methods. It is impossible to turn the\r\nyellowing pages of the “Congressional Globe,” recording the day-by-day\r\nstory of the fight, without a growing feeling of admiration for Polk. He\r\nwas never diverted from the question, never excited by attacks, patient,\r\nand yet always pressing courteously for action. In the midst of the\r\nfrenzied partisans, he looms large.\r\n\r\nThe fight began over the reference of the Taney report and Polk’s motion\r\nthat it be referred to his committee. In explaining his reasons the\r\nlatter avowed a purpose to investigate the Bank, and the forces rushed\r\ninto action. “Why investigate,” cried McDuffie, “when admissions would\r\nbe made without an investigation?” Had Bank money been used in the\r\ncampaign? Admitted! “State your sum,” he shouted, “fifty, sixty, or a\r\nhundred thousand.” The Congress had named a depository for the public\r\nmoney; it had been removed; it must be restored--that was the subject\r\nfor debate.[738] Binney immediately arose to supplement McDuffie’s\r\nsuggestion. “What is the object of the inquiry asked for?” he demanded.\r\n“Is it to suggest reasons for the Secretary’s act ...? If you bring in\r\nother facts, other judgments, other reasons, you annul the judgment of\r\nthe Secretary, agree that it was wrong, and assume to exercise an\r\noriginal instead of a derivative power.” If Taney had acted on\r\nsufficient reasons, “it was for the House, on behalf of the people, to\r\npronounce their judgment; and if they were sufficient, then there was an\r\nend to the question.” More: “What knowledge have we of the condition of\r\nthe banks selected by the Government?”\r\n\r\nThe State banks not safe? Polk retorted. Very well, “this constitutes\r\none of the chief objects of the investigation proposed.” A “question of\r\npublic faith?” as Binney had hinted. “Is it not proper, then,” asked\r\nPolk, “for a committee ... to inquire by which party the contract was\r\nviolated?” And only to inquire into the sufficiency of Taney’s reasons?\r\nWhy, “some of the reasons given may involve the charter of the\r\nBank.”[739]\r\n\r\nAfter a week of wrangling, the Administration won on the reference, but\r\nthe moment the vote was announced, McDuffie moved instructions to the\r\ncommittee to report a joint resolution providing for the depositing of\r\nall revenues thereafter collected in the Bank of the United States--and\r\nthis was the peg on which the main discussion hung.\r\n\r\nThe impetuous McDuffie was the first to rush into the arena. His was a\r\nbitter, brilliant excoriation of Jackson, a fulsome glorification of the\r\nBank, and he thundered on for two days,[740] impassioned, in a state of\r\nconstant volcanic eruption, but little more than “a fierce attack upon\r\nthe President.”[741] One week later Polk consumed two days in a reply\r\nwhich, in its moderation of tone and language and its argumentative\r\ncharacter, was in striking contrast to that of the vituperative\r\nCarolinian. Defending in detail the position of Jackson, discussing the\r\nlegal and constitutional phases, citing precedents and authorities, he\r\nbuilt up a case for the Administration which could not have been other\r\nthan impressive in view of the attempt of most of the Bank’s champions\r\nto answer him.[742] Another week elapsed before Horace Binney rose to\r\nreply, in a masterpiece of parliamentary oratory. In musically flowing\r\nsentences he described the prosperity preceding the attack upon the\r\nBank, the nature of the currency and credit, the effect of the shaking\r\nof confidence, the necessity for the Bank’s curtailments, and argued\r\nthat “the control of the public deposits is inherent in the Congress.”\r\nBut had the Bank been charged with exercising political power?\r\n“Granted--granted--the charge is granted, but the Bank has not succeeded\r\nin this exercise of political power.... The late election proves that it\r\ndid not succeed. The force of array, legislative and executive, is\r\nagainst the Bank; and it did not succeed. The act of removal was not,\r\ntherefore, an imperative and retributive act; but an act of malignant\r\ndye--an act vindictive.” In all his historical researches he knew of\r\nonly one instance where a charter had been destroyed “on the alleged\r\nground of the assumption of political power.” That was in the reign of\r\nCharles II, when, on that ground, he obtained possession of the charter\r\nof London. “But it was restored when constitutional liberty dawned.”\r\nThus he approached his conclusion--a demand for the immediate\r\nrestoration of the deposits, and, speaking with a rapidity that the\r\nreporter could not follow, launched upon his peroration, with the plea\r\nthat the question be not considered in the spirit of party, but “rather\r\nas one affecting the general interest of the community; as one involving\r\nthe integrity of the Constitution, the stability of contracts, and the\r\npermanence of free government; as a question involving public faith,\r\nnational existence, and the honor and integrity of the country, at home\r\nand abroad.”[743]\r\n\r\nThus, refraining from personalities, and frowning upon the party aspect\r\nof the controversy, the most clever of the Bank’s champions, speaking\r\nwith the cunning of the proverbial “Philadelphia lawyer,” attempted, too\r\nlate, to undo the work Clay had done to serve a selfish end. The night\r\nafter the conclusion of the speech found him at the White House, one of\r\nnumerous guests, and Jackson sought him, devoted himself to him with an\r\nembarrassing assiduity, and thanked him for advocating his cause without\r\nindulgence in personal abuse.\r\n\r\nBut it was not every Philadelphia lawyer that was to be looked upon so\r\nkindly in Jacksonian circles. In the midst of the struggle in the House\r\na series of Bank articles began to appear in the “National Gazette” over\r\nthe signature of “Vindex.” It was just at the time Joseph Hopkinson, the\r\nFederal Judge for eastern Pennsylvania, began to haunt the floor and\r\nlobby of the House--a privilege he enjoyed by virtue of previous\r\nmembership in that body. His activity among the members became so open\r\nas to create comment, and the “National Gazette” made a laborious\r\nattempt to explain his presence. It was a purely social visit. He had\r\ncome on the invitation of the Judges of the Supreme Court. It was\r\nnatural that he should delight in renewing old friendships. This\r\nexplanation gave Blair his opportunity, in a column editorial, to assail\r\nthe Philadelphia jurist as a lobbyist, to insist that he had\r\ndisqualified himself to sit on any Bank case, and to challenge the\r\n“National Gazette” to deny that he was the author of the “Vindex”\r\narticles.\r\n\r\n“But further we would inquire,” wrote Blair, “whether the judge is not a\r\ndebtor of the Bank as well as its anonymous vindicator? We believe he\r\nis--and it is difficult to say whether the judge’s extreme solicitude\r\nand activity in behalf of the Bank arises from its pecuniary favors, the\r\nbonds of family affection which bind him to Mr. Biddle, his son having\r\nmarried Mr. Biddle’s sister, or the old Federal feeling which always\r\ndistinguished him, and which inclined him against his country during the\r\nlast war, and prompted his speech after its close, declaring the Nation\r\nwas disgraced by the peace.”[744] Such was the bitterness and such were\r\nthe blunt weapons in evidence in the contest even in the House.\r\n\r\nEarly in March, Polk submitted his report justifying every step of the\r\nAdministration, and including the sensational resolution providing for\r\nan investigation of the Bank at Philadelphia. Binney submitted a\r\nminority report favoring the restoration of the deposits, and the debate\r\ntook a fresh start. The outstanding speech of this phase of the debate\r\nwas that of Rufus Choate, described by Adams, on the evening of its\r\ndelivery, as “the most eloquent speech of the session, and, in a course\r\nof reasoning, altogether impressive and original.”[745] Still young, and\r\nhis public career but brief, his great intellectual labors had already\r\nundermined his health, and even thus early in life he presented to the\r\nHouse when he arose the “cadaverous look” which confronts us to-day in\r\nthe portraits of his later life.[746] With all the consummate skill\r\nwhich so distinguished his advocacy in the courts, he sought to divert\r\nthe discussion from the channels it had followed. “As to the Bank\r\nitself,” he said, “I shall go throughout on the supposition that it will\r\nnot be rechartered. I call on gentlemen to look upon the proposition to\r\nrestore the deposits merely as a temporary measure of relief.” The\r\ncrying need of the immediate hour was the use of the public money, and\r\nthis could be had in a beneficial way at the time only through the Bank\r\nof the United States. Like Binney, he won the respect of Administration\r\nforces, and the succeeding speaker, hostile to the restoration, found\r\nthe views expressed “new and interesting, and delivered in a tone and\r\nspirit becoming the representatives of a free people.”[747] But the\r\ndebate dragged on without any high lights until in early April, when\r\nMcDuffie returned to the attack, still in a superheated condition, and\r\nseeing swords and daggers gleaming in the air. Never in all history, he\r\nthought, had “the progress of the usurpation of the Executive been more\r\nrapid, more bold, or more successful than in the United States in the\r\nlast fifteen months.” As he sat down, the previous question was moved,\r\nand with the appointment of tellers there fell a deep silence with the\r\ncontending forces “glowering upon each other.”[748] The roll was\r\ncalled--and victory fell to the Jacksonians with an overwhelming\r\nmajority.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the resolutions providing for an investigation, a\r\ncommittee was appointed, and with no thought of meeting opposition, it\r\nrepaired to Philadelphia, sent Biddle a copy of the resolutions,\r\ninformed him of the committee’s presence and its readiness to visit the\r\nBank on the following day at any hour that he would indicate. Then\r\nfollowed days of struggle, with the committee obstructed at every turn\r\nby the technical barricades thrown up by John Sergeant. It was not for\r\nnothing, in the old days, that men characterized the cunning as “smart\r\nas a Philadelphia lawyer.” Having exhausted their resources, the\r\ncommitteemen returned to Washington and prepared reports to the House.\r\nThe minority report, submitted by Edward Everett, excused the Bank. The\r\nmajority charged contempt of the House, and asked that warrants be\r\nissued for the arrest of Biddle and the directors. A few days later\r\nAdams offered his resolution to discharge the committee from further\r\nduty, setting forth that there had been no contempt, and characterizing\r\nthe proposed arrest of Biddle and his directors as “unconstitutional,\r\narbitrary, and an oppressive abuse of power.” If this resolution was\r\nnovel, under the circumstances, the speech in which it was supported was\r\neven more remarkable. “The House has sent a committee to investigate the\r\naffairs of the Bank,” Adams said. “Have they not done it? Not one word\r\non that subject is to be found in the report. It contains no information\r\non the affairs of the Bank.”[749] And how could the House enforce its\r\ndecrees? he asked. “We have not a soldier to enforce our orders.” And\r\nAdams was more laudatory in his references to the bankers,\r\n“distinguished for their talents,” than he ever was to political friend\r\nor foe.\r\n\r\nThus nothing came of the resolutions. Perhaps nothing was expected. If\r\nthe Bank’s curt treatment of the committee amused the business element\r\nand the Whig politicians, it delighted Kendall and Blair, for they knew\r\nhow effectively the incident could be used with the masses.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nAfter the adoption of the Poindexter resolutions no further steps were\r\ntaken in the Senate until Clay, three weeks later, presented his\r\nresolution ordering the restoration of the deposits. This was in the\r\nmidst of the difficulties of the House committee with the Bank. Why,\r\ndemanded Benton, had it not been presented in the early part of the\r\nsession? Why now with no possibility of concurrence in the House? And\r\nwhy now in the midst of a controversy between the House and the Bank,\r\nwith contempt proceedings pending against the Bank, and the House\r\nawaiting the report of its investigation? What right had the Senate to\r\ninterfere in behalf of the Bank? He hoped the Senate would postpone the\r\nconsideration of the resolution for a week to permit the House to decide\r\nthe question of contempt.[750] Nevertheless, the Senate, by a party\r\nvote, passed the futile resolution.\r\n\r\nBut the senatorial champions of the Bank were to encounter\r\nembarrassments other than those growing out of the action of the House.\r\nIn May, Mr. Clay had called upon Taney for a report upon the finances.\r\nAt the time this was done, the Senate was being deluged with distress\r\npetitions, mass meetings were being held, and the doleful senatorial\r\ndescriptions of wreck and ruin were falling mournfully upon the Senate\r\nChamber, day by day. It was the middle of June when Taney’s report\r\nreached the Senate. The facts as set forth were in such startling\r\ncontrast with conditions as they had been depicted by Clay and his\r\nfollowers that the Administration leaders, always clever, and always\r\nthinking more of the voters in the country than of the politicians in\r\nthe Senate house, determined that it should have the greatest possible\r\npublicity. The day before, Taney had summoned Benton to the Treasury,\r\nand had gone over the report with him, furnishing him with all the data,\r\nand preparing him for a speech that could be sent to the country. As\r\nanticipated, the reading in the Senate had not proceeded far when\r\nWebster arose to move that further reading be dispensed with, and the\r\nreport sent to the Finance Committee. Benton objected. The report was\r\nread. Then Benton, in his most flamboyant mood, arose to comment upon\r\nit.\r\n\r\n“Well, the answer comes,” he exclaimed with the Bentonian flourish. “It\r\nis a report to make the patriot heart rejoice, replete with rich\r\ninformation, pregnant with evidences of national prosperity. How is it\r\nreceived--how received by those who called for it? With downcast looks\r\nand wordless tongues. A motion is made to stop the reading.” But he did\r\nnot propose that such a report should be disposed of “in this\r\nunceremonious and compendious style.” No, “a pit was dug for Mr. Taney;\r\nthe diggers of the pit have fallen into it: the fault is not his; and\r\nthe sooner they clamber out, the better for themselves.” And, regardless\r\nof the embarrassment of the conspirators, he proposed that the country\r\nshould know that “never since America had a place among nations was the\r\nprosperity of the country equal to what it is this day.”[751]\r\n\r\nIn this exordium he did not exaggerate the story of the figures of the\r\nreport; and the report did not misrepresent the condition of the\r\ncountry. The Bank panic had run out. Only its friends were now\r\nsuffering, and even Philip Hone in New York was secretly cursing the\r\nname of Biddle.\r\n\r\nBut the enemies of the Administration in the Senate were to have their\r\nrevenge. Andrew Stevenson, for almost seven years Speaker of the House,\r\none of the most courtly and talented men in public life, had been\r\nnominated for the English Mission. He resigned from the Speakership and\r\nfrom Congress, and his name was sent to the Senate for confirmation. And\r\nthe political combination that, in a spirit of proscription, had refused\r\nto confirm Van Buren, declined to confirm the man selected as his\r\nsuccessor. This act was too flagrant even for John Tyler, who voted to\r\nconfirm.[752] As a result of this petty policy, America was\r\nunrepresented in England from 1832, when Van Buren was humiliated, until\r\n1836, when a Democratic Senate confirmed Stevenson.\r\n\r\nAs the end of the session approached, Jackson sent to the Senate the\r\nnominations of Taney and Butler, as Secretary of the Treasury and\r\nAttorney-General. The latter was confirmed; the former rejected. But the\r\nrejection of Taney had been considered more than probable by Jackson,\r\nwho had refrained from sending the nomination to the Senate until the\r\nlast minute. This was the first time, however, in the history of the\r\nGovernment that a Cabinet officer had failed of confirmation. It was in\r\nno sense, however, a reflection upon the man; it merely reflected the\r\ninsane bitterness of the time. On his return to Maryland, Taney was\r\ngreeted with a series of ovations. At Baltimore he was met by a\r\nmultitude and conveyed in a barouche drawn by four white horses,\r\nescorted by a cavalcade of several hundred horsemen, and given a dinner.\r\nAnother dinner awaited him at Frederick, and another at Elkton, and each\r\nwas made the occasion for a powerful speech which made an impression on\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nThus the prolonged session of Congress, lasting almost seven months,\r\nhad accomplished nothing for the Bank. The anti-Jackson Senate had\r\ncensured the President and ordered the restoration of the deposits. The\r\nJacksonian House had declared against the restoration of the deposits,\r\nagainst the renewal of the charter, and had summoned Nicholas Biddle to\r\nits bar for contempt. The politicians had fought the battle in Congress\r\nto a deadlock, and the next and final fight was to be waged at the\r\npolls.\r\n\r\nWe shall now note the effect of the sham battles of the Congress on the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL HYDROPHOBIA\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nPhilip Hone, seated in the little Senate Chamber, and still entranced\r\nwith Clay’s theatrical appeal to Van Buren, was awakened from his\r\nreverie by observing Webster beckoning him out of the room. The\r\nentertainer of the Whig celebrities followed the god of his idolatry to\r\none of the committee rooms, where, for more than an hour, the orator\r\n“unburdened his mind fully on the state of affairs and future\r\nprospects.” The burden of it all was the importance of carrying the\r\nspring elections. When Hone called on Clay, he found him of the same\r\nopinion. “He says that the only hope is the election in our State and in\r\nPennsylvania.” Meeting John Quincy Adams, “that sagacious man,” he found\r\nthat the former President shared the belief that “our only hope lies in\r\nthe elections in New York and Pennsylvania, particularly our charter\r\nelection.”[753] That the Administration forces and the Kitchen Cabinet\r\nwere equally impressed with the strategic value of victories in New York\r\nCity is disclosed in a letter from Major Lewis to James A. Hamilton,\r\n“Have you any doubt of succeeding at your election?” he wrote. “I hope\r\nnot; yet I confess I have my fears. The strongest ground to take with\r\nthe people is the fact, that under the existing arrangements with the\r\nState banks, the whole revenue collected through your customs house is\r\nleft to be dispensed in your own city, instead of being transferred to a\r\nneighboring rival city. Our friends should ring the changes upon this\r\nview in every quarter of the city.”[754] It is thus evident that the\r\ncontending forces were concentrating for the election of aldermen and a\r\nmayor in a city then numbering few more than 200,000 people.\r\n\r\nEarly in March the Opposition deliberately made the Bank the issue by\r\nnominating Gulian C. Verplanck, driven from Congress by the Democrats\r\nbecause of his fidelity to the Bank, and planning for a popular\r\nvindication of that institution. Two days later the Democrats nominated\r\nCornelius W. Lawrence, who had been exceedingly bitter against the Bank\r\nwhile in Congress. Accepting Hone’s opinion that “the personal\r\ncharacters of both the gentlemen is above reproach,”[755] the election\r\nwould definitely determine the drift of public opinion on the contest\r\nthen in its most bitter stage. The election returns were confusing. The\r\nmayoralty candidate, who had been ousted from his seat in Congress\r\nbecause of his support of Biddle, was defeated by the man whose\r\nbitterness against the Bank while in Congress had been notable. The\r\nDemocrats won here, and the Opposition lost. The fact that the latter\r\nelected a majority of the aldermen was loudly hailed as a vote against\r\nJackson on the Bank question, although, in the more spirited contest for\r\nthe more important office, the Bank champion was overwhelmed by the\r\nDemocrat. The Opposition was jubilant, or pretended to jubilation. A\r\ngreat celebration was held at Castle Garden, and the faithful poured\r\nforth by the tens of thousands to sit about the tables “spread in a row”\r\nand to do full justice to the “three pipes of wine and forty barrels of\r\nbeer placed in the center under an awning.” Full of fire and froth, the\r\nexuberant partisans, learning that Webster was the guest of a lady at\r\nher home, moved thence _en masse_, where the orator, who had declined to\r\nappear among the beer kegs in the Garden, presented himself at the\r\nwindow and delivered “an address full of fire” which “was received with\r\nrapturous shouts.”[756] All over the Eastern country the Whigs insisted\r\non accepting the defeat of the Bank candidate for mayor as a victory\r\nfor the Bank, and the Philadelphians had “a grand celebration at\r\nPowelton on the Schuylkill”; the Whigs of Albany “fired one hundred\r\nguns”; the Whigs of Buffalo “made a great affair of it with guns and\r\nilluminations”; those of Portsmouth “received the news with one hundred\r\nguns” and “had a town meeting and made speeches.”[757] Meanwhile the\r\nDemocrats were proclaiming the election of Lawrence a Jacksonian\r\ntriumph. After the various salutes from Portsmouth to the Battery of a\r\nhundred guns, and the celebration in the Garden among the beer kegs, the\r\nDemocrats arranged their celebration for the day that Lawrence was to\r\nmake his triumphant entry. A steamboat went down to Amboy to receive the\r\nmayor-elect, and “with colors flying and loud huzzas,” the Jacksonians\r\nsat down to a dinner on board, “where Jackson toasts were drunk and\r\nJackson speeches were made.” Landing at Castle Garden, the new mayor was\r\nconducted in a “barouche drawn by four white horses, and paraded through\r\nthe streets.”[758]\r\n\r\nBut the desperate Opposition, hard pressed, and requiring encouragement\r\nfor its followers, succeeded, through exaggerations and red fire, in\r\nconvincing the rank and file that an anti-Jackson wave had swept the\r\nNation. Rhode Island, never a Jackson State, went against the Democrats,\r\nand this was celebrated with as much enthusiasm as though a stronghold\r\nof the enemy had been taken. The triumph of the Whigs in the\r\nPhiladelphia ward elections was exploited as a signal triumph. Virginia,\r\nanti-Bank as well as anti-Jackson, was lost to the Democrats, and the\r\nOpposition interpreted it as a pro-Bank as well as an anti-Jackson\r\nverdict. In Louisiana the Whigs won on the tariff, but the impression\r\nwas given that the result reflected a popular resentment of the\r\nmistreatment of Nicholas Biddle. As a matter of fact, no intelligent\r\npolitician could have attached any particular significance to the\r\nresults of the spring elections, and the leaders immediately began\r\ntheir preparations for the congressional elections in the fall.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nIn these elections the Opposition to Jacksonian Democracy was to fight\r\nfor the first time under its new party name. In February, 1834, James\r\nWatson Webb, the unscrupulous speculator in Bank stock, and editor of\r\nthe “Courier and Enquirer” of New York City, had proposed that the\r\ncombination against the policies of Jackson should be known as the Whig\r\nParty. “It is a glorious name,” said John Forsyth, “and I have no doubt\r\nthey will disgrace it.” Within six months the National Republicans and\r\nthe Anti-Masons disappeared--united under the Whig banner. In September,\r\n1834, Niles records, in his “Register,” that, “as if by universal\r\nconsent, all parties opposed to the present Administration call\r\nthemselves Whigs.” And all who called themselves Whigs denounced the\r\nJacksonians as Tories. It was a pretty conceit. The Whigs of England had\r\nfought the battles of the people against the usurpations of the throne,\r\nand the Whigs of America were fighting the usurpations of Jackson. The\r\nConstitution against anarchy, the people against the Power--such was the\r\nfight of Nicholas Biddle, Henry Clay, and John C. Calhoun against\r\nJackson.\r\n\r\nA more incongruous combination of contradictions and a more sinister and\r\nunholy alliance than that of the Whigs of the Jacksonian period has\r\nnever appeared in the political life of the Republic. These men held\r\ncommon opinions on none of the fundamental principles of government. A\r\nfew years, and few of the leaders and founders could agree as to the\r\ncharacter of the combination.[759] The only plank in the platform of\r\nthis ragged array on which all could stand was a hatred of Andrew\r\nJackson. That was the open sesame to the temple. Beyond that no\r\nquestions were asked. Born with the seed of inevitable disintegration,\r\nit was to stagger along through twenty years, to end without a mourner,\r\nand to leave no record worthy of an epitaph. And about the time of its\r\nbirth, and after its insignificant successes in the spring elections,\r\nthat astute journalist and politician, Thomas Ritchie, of the “Richmond\r\nEnquirer,” foresaw its future with the clear light of a prophet. “When\r\nit comes to act upon any policy or principle,” he wrote, “not connected\r\nwith a hatred of Jackson, it must fall to pieces and commence a war\r\n_inter se_. It contains all the elements of dissolution, and is destined\r\nto share the fate of other monstrous alliances.”[760]\r\n\r\nBut its creators were not concerned in 1834 with anything further than\r\nthe overthrow of Jackson and his followers. Not daring to advance a\r\nconstructive programme, for the very effort would have wrecked the\r\nparty, they confined themselves to extravagant and absurd denunciations\r\nof Jackson as a tyrant usurping power and clambering to a throne. The\r\ncongressional campaign opened with a rush. All over the land the Whigs\r\nwere raising liberty poles--because they were fighting the battle of\r\nliberty against the despot. And Nicholas Biddle and his Bank, as usual,\r\nwore the liberty cap. When Congress adjourned in June, the moneyed\r\ninstitution was in a dying condition, and the money market was again\r\nabout normal. Only a signal Whig triumph could now save the institution\r\non Chestnut Street.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nWith the adjournment of Congress, Jackson, with his customary\r\ncomplacency and confidence in the support of the people, set forth for\r\nthe Hermitage for a much-needed rest. He had just again reorganized his\r\nCabinet because of the failure of the Senate to confirm Taney and the\r\nresignation of Louis McLane. The motive for the latter’s retirement is\r\nonly conjectural. That he had never felt at home in the Cabinet circle,\r\nwe may well believe. While in the Cabinet, he was not of it. But for the\r\nconstant friendship and support of Van Buren, his position would have\r\nbeen delicate indeed. He was out of sympathy with Jackson at every stage\r\nof the Bank fight. He would have renewed the old charter without a\r\nchange; would have renewed it with concessions from the Bank; but he\r\nwould have renewed it. With the removal of the deposits he was entirely\r\nout of sympathy. He would not have removed them at all; but, if removed,\r\nhe would not have removed them until Congress had convened. His social\r\naffiliations were largely with the old official aristocracy. That he\r\nentertained presidential aspirations was generally understood, and it is\r\nquite possible that he considered a complete separation from the\r\nAdministration advantageous to his interests. His associations were such\r\nthat he could not have heard much that was not venomously hostile to\r\nJackson and the Jacksonians. But, a gentleman of dignity, he withdrew\r\ngracefully, plunging into no undignified recriminations.[761]\r\n\r\nIn appointing his successor, Jackson turned to John Forsyth, whose\r\nservices as Administration floor leader in the Senate had been of\r\nimmense value, and whose urbanity, wisdom, conservatism, diplomatic\r\nexperience, fitted him for the post better than any of his Jacksonian\r\npredecessors. To the place left vacant by Taney, he transferred Mr.\r\nWoodbury, and to the navy he appointed Mahlon Dickerson of New Jersey, a\r\ngentleman of extensive public experience as a Senator for sixteen years.\r\nJust previous to his appointment, he had declined the Russian Mission.\r\nThis was the only Cabinet upheaval of Jackson’s time which had not been\r\naccompanied with much bitterness, with charges and countercharges.\r\n\r\nThus, with affairs in Washington in capable hands, with victory in the\r\nBank fight on his side, with the delights of the Hermitage just beyond,\r\nthe iron man set forth in high spirits and with no regrets or fears. The\r\nBiddle threat of more “discipline” for the people during the summer and\r\nautumn, because of the failure of Congress to recharter the Bank, had\r\nnot disturbed him so much as it had alarmed the Whigs. Those in Boston\r\nmet the threat with a counter-threat of denunciation, and those in New\r\nYork warned Biddle that more distress would certainly prove disastrous\r\nto the Whigs in the fall elections. Biddle deeply resented the criticism\r\nof the Whigs, who, under the leadership of Clay, had practically\r\nblackmailed him into using the Bank’s power against the Democrats. When\r\nthose of Boston warned that more discipline of the people might “even\r\ncreate a necessity for the Whigs, in self-defense, to separate\r\nthemselves entirely” from his institution, he wrote in defiant mood to\r\nthe president of his Boston branch that “if ... any political party or\r\nassociation desires to separate itself from the Bank--be it so.” He had\r\nnot read the letter to the board of directors lest the members favorable\r\nto the Democrats might use it to the disadvantage of the Whigs.[762] But\r\nhe was to find that his frown had lost its force. Another Whig from New\r\nYork wrote of much dissatisfaction in that city and State among the\r\nBank’s friends and “those of influence in the Whig Party--and sure I am\r\nthat it is increasing every day.” The feeling was prevalent, encouraged\r\nby the views of Albert Gallatin, that the Bank could have relieved the\r\ndistress had it so desired. And Alexander Hamilton, the brother of\r\nJackson’s friend, and son of the father of the National Bank, wrote a\r\nlittle later to a correspondent that “it has been found expedient to\r\nabandon the Bank in our political pilgrimage.” He found that “the people\r\nare now familiarly acquainted with the immense power of a national bank\r\nand apprehend all kinds of terrible consequences from its\r\nexercise.”[763] Thus, instead of more “discipline,” the Bank found it\r\npossible to take steps, which, according to Catterall, justified\r\nJackson, the following December, in saying in his Message that “the Bank\r\n... announced its ability and readiness to abandon the system of\r\nunparalleled curtailment ... and to extend its accommodations to the\r\ncommunity.”\r\n\r\nJust, as in 1832, when floating down the Ohio on his last visit to the\r\nHermitage during the presidential campaign, Andrew Jackson was at peace\r\nwith himself and the world. But his friends had given orders to take\r\nnothing for granted and to open the fighting along the whole line. They\r\nhad a twofold purpose--to hold the line in Congress, and to defeat,\r\nwherever possible, any senatorial enemies who were candidates for\r\nreëlection. Blair, of the “Globe,” began to issue special editions and\r\nto send them broadcast all over the country.\r\n\r\nThe fight, as it was waged in New York, Virginia, and Mississippi, will\r\nsuffice to illustrate the general character and method of the campaign.\r\nIn all three States the Bank was the issue. Even the most hopeful of the\r\nWhigs entertained no illusions as to Pennsylvania, where the most\r\npowerful financial and commercial interests were arrayed with the Bank.\r\nThe two parties in the Empire State were mobilized, organized on a\r\nmilitary footing, and ready and eager for the fray.[764] The elections\r\nin New Jersey and Pennsylvania were held in October, a month before\r\nthose in New York, and the first shock to the Whigs came in the returns\r\nfrom these two States. That Pennsylvania, the home of Biddle, Sergeant,\r\nand Duane, should have gone against the Bank and for Jackson, was not\r\ndisappointing, for little had been expected there. But much was expected\r\nin New Jersey. There the issue was distinct. The two Senators from that\r\nState had voted with the Bank on the deposits question. The Legislature\r\nhad adopted resolutions commendatory of Jackson’s actions, and in his\r\nProtest the fighting President had not scrupled to quote these\r\nresolutions to prove that the Senators had deliberately misrepresented\r\ntheir people. Senator Frelinghuysen, in commenting upon these\r\ninstructions, had boasted that he and his colleague had “dared to meet\r\nthe frowns of their constituents,” and would not “bow the knee to these\r\ninstructions.”[765] Now he was before the people for reëlection, and the\r\nissue was plain. The people’s verdict was unmistakable. The little State\r\nswept into the Jackson column with a substantial majority, and\r\nFrelinghuysen was retired.\r\n\r\nGoaded by the sting of the New Jersey defeat, the New York Whigs\r\nredoubled their efforts. “The Whigs are raising liberty poles in all the\r\nwards,” wrote Hone. “I went to one of these ceremonies yesterday at the\r\ncorner of the Bowery and Hester Street. The pole, a hundred feet high,\r\nwith a splendid cap and gilt vane with suitable devices, was escorted by\r\na procession of good men and true.”[766] Thus, if the “mob” could make\r\nthe welkin ring at Democratic meetings, the more aristocratic Whigs\r\ncould sally forth from their counting-rooms and libraries to rub\r\nshoulders with the common herd at Hester Street and the Bowery and shout\r\napproval of the raising of a pole. But all was in vain. By nine o’clock\r\non the evening of the first day, Hone and his fellow Whigs realized that\r\n“enough was known to satisfy us to our hearts’ content that we are\r\nbeaten--badly beaten; worse than the least sanguine of us\r\nexpected.”[767] The jubilant Democrats, however, were determined that\r\nthe Whig leaders should not feel utterly deserted, and a crowd of them\r\nsurged before Hone’s house with hisses and catcalls which kept him awake\r\nall night. The Lord Holland of the American Whigs, who was sick at the\r\ntime, was inclined to resent it, but the next evening he found\r\nconsolation in dining with Webster who “was in a vein to be exceedingly\r\npleasant.”[768]\r\n\r\nSuch was the intensity of feeling and the bitterness of the struggle\r\nthat enthusiastic partisans partook of the nature of mobs in the larger\r\ncenters. Nowhere were the Democrats so intense as in Philadelphia,\r\nwhere, on election day, the warring partisans exchanged shots, the\r\nheadquarters of the Whigs was sacked and burned by a mob which drove\r\nback the firemen that attempted to quench the flames. A number of houses\r\nwere completely reduced to ashes. Such was the panic of Nicholas Biddle\r\nthat the day before the election he sent his wife and children into the\r\ncountry, filled his house with armed men, and prepared for a siege. The\r\nBank building bristled with the bayonets and muskets of guards. But when\r\nthe gray dawn came, the one-time financial dictator found that none of\r\nhis property had been molested. It was blow enough to him to learn that\r\nthe Whigs, the country over, had gone down before the popular uprising.\r\n\r\nBut the bitterest fight was waged in Virginia, where the situation was\r\nmixed to the point of chaos. The State was anti-Bank, but it was\r\nanti-Jackson. Opposed to the Bank, it had been equally opposed to the\r\nremoval of the deposits. The feeling in Richmond was so inflamed that\r\nonly personal respect for Ritchie saved the “Enquirer” from mob\r\nviolence, for the courageous editor stuck to his guns and tried to\r\ndivert attention to the Bank itself. Administration papers were\r\nestablished throughout the State with instructions to follow the lead of\r\nhis pen. The Virginia plan was twofold: to make the most of the\r\nunpopularity of Leigh, who was again a candidate for the Senate, and to\r\ndivide and distract the Whigs by playing Clay against Calhoun. Nowhere\r\ndid the Democrats appreciate, as they did in Virginia, the impossible\r\nnature of the Whig combination, and they dwelt upon its inconsistencies\r\nfrom the beginning. Clay announced that he was not a candidate for the\r\npresidential nomination in 1836. “But Mr. Clay knows not himself,” wrote\r\nRitchie. “But ambition does not burn so intensely in his bosom as it\r\ndoes in the heart of another leader of the Senate (Mr. Calhoun). If\r\nrecent signs do not deceive us, this extraordinary man (extraordinary\r\nevery way for the vigor of his mind, the variety of his principles, and\r\nthe intensity of his ambition) will soon take the field, with feeble\r\nhopes of winning the votes of the South, as well as the support of the\r\nBank. Then we shall see under which king the various members of the\r\nopposition will range themselves.”[769] This irrepressible conflict of\r\nWhig ambitions and interests was played upon by the Democratic press of\r\nVirginia all through the summer and autumn of 1834.\r\n\r\nBut the immediate purpose of the Virginia Democrats was to humiliate\r\nLeigh, who was unpopular with the masses because of his bitter fight in\r\nthe Constitutional Convention against the extension of the suffrage. And\r\nhe was as strongly with the Bank as Virginia was against it. A\r\nhouse-to-house canvass was made, and in districts where a majority were\r\nfound against him it was proposed to evoke the right of instructions to\r\nAssemblymen. The plan succeeded to the extent of disclosing a majority\r\nhostile to the reëlection of Leigh, but the Whigs, who carried the\r\nState, succeeded after a bitter struggle in returning him through a\r\nflagrant disregard of the expressed will of the constituencies. The\r\nbattle was thus but half lost. The Democrats were supplied with\r\nammunition they were to use with deadly effect, and within little more\r\nthan a year they were to drive the two anti-Jackson Senators of Virginia\r\ninto private life. Ritchie began the next year’s battle without delay.\r\nThe “Enquirer” was flooded with resolutions and letters protesting the\r\nelection of Leigh over the instructions of the majority of the\r\npeople.[770]\r\n\r\nIn Mississippi the Jacksonians determined to prevent the reëlection of\r\nSenator Poindexter, long the idol of the Mississippi Democracy, who had\r\nturned upon Jackson with a virulence scarcely equaled by any old-line\r\nFederalist, and cast his lot with Clay. With the adjournment of\r\nCongress, the Mississippi Senator hastened home, where the enemies of\r\nthe Administration had planned a series of banquets at which he was to\r\ndenounce the President and vindicate himself. The Whigs were with him.\r\nThe Democrats, delighted with a slashing and brilliant assault on\r\nPoindexter by Robert J. Walker, put that able publicist in the field,\r\nand within a week he was engaged in one of the most spectacular\r\ncanvasses Mississippi had ever known, firing enormous open-air meetings\r\nof frenzied Jacksonians. The outcome was the election of Walker--a\r\nvictory sweet to Jackson, for it was the vanquished who had sponsored\r\nthe resolution attacking his Protest.[771] And the triumph was all the\r\nsweeter from the fact that, while Poindexter had supported the\r\nNullifiers, Walker had taken the lead against them in Mississippi, on\r\nthe platform, and through the press.\r\n\r\nThus the elections of 1834 were more than pleasing to Jackson and his\r\nparty. Two of his strongest senatorial opponents had lost their seats as\r\na result of their opposition, and Leigh had been saved only by a\r\ndisreputable betrayal of the people. In the Senate the Administration\r\nwas strengthened; and in the House the Democratic majority was reduced\r\nbut eight votes, leaving it a clear majority of 46 out of 242 members.\r\n\r\nStrangely enough, so reliable an historian as McMaster has described\r\nthese elections as a triumph of the Whigs. Such was not the\r\ninterpretation of the Whigs themselves. Hone thought that they were\r\n“badly beaten--worse than the least sanguine of us expected.”[772]\r\nWebster accepted the verdict as final, and, much to the distress and\r\nindignation of Biddle, announced that he was through. But the most\r\nconclusive evidence of the contemporary opinion of the Whigs comes from\r\nThurlow Weed, the sagacious Whig journalist of the “Albany Journal.”\r\nMore prescient than most of the Whig leaders of the time, he had\r\nforeseen the inevitable result of an attempt to win upon the Bank issue.\r\nQuite early, when Webster’s keynote speech on the Bank, delivered at a\r\nmass meeting in Boston, was sent for publication to all the party\r\npapers, the copy that reached Weed never found its way into the “Albany\r\nJournal.”[773] And immediately after the election in 1834, he\r\neditorially expressed the feeling which appears to have taken possession\r\nof the party generally. “There is one cause,” he wrote, “for\r\ncongratulations, connected with the recent election, in which even we\r\nparticipate. It has terminated the United States Bank war.... We have\r\nfrom the beginning deprecated the successive conflicts in defense of the\r\nBank.... But we have gone with our friends through these three\r\ncampaigns, under a strong and settled conviction that in every issue to\r\nbe tried by the people to which the Bank was a party, we must be beaten.\r\nAfter struggling along from year to year with a doomed Bank upon our\r\nshoulders, both the Bank and our party are finally overwhelmed.[774]”\r\nNor is it surprising that Clay, whose selfishness had forced Biddle into\r\nmaking the recharter a campaign issue, was glad to dump the doomed Bank\r\nfrom his shoulders. It is impossible to follow his course, pointing as\r\nevery act does to a purely party purpose, without arriving at the\r\nconviction that he really cared little about the institution on Chestnut\r\nStreet. As the fight became more hopeless, he found the importunities of\r\nBiddle more irksome. Viewed purely as a political or party contest, the\r\nclever politicians who dominated the Jacksonian camp had shown far more\r\nprescience and sagacity than the wisest of the Whigs. Amos Kendall had\r\na better understanding of the psychology of the masses than Clay or\r\nWebster. Among the Whigs, Weed alone saw the end from the beginning. The\r\nattempt to arouse the people in behalf of a great moneyed institution\r\nagainst the attacks of a popular hero was in itself a grotesque and\r\nghastly absurdity. But after the decision had been made to undertake it,\r\nthe methods of Biddle and his political allies made defeat a certainty.\r\nFrank Blair, of the “Globe,” was evidently sincere in his assertion that\r\nhad he been permitted to dictate the policy of the Whigs, he could not\r\nhave hit upon a plan more satisfactory to the Democrats.\r\n\r\nThat Jackson knew little of banking and advanced some strange theories\r\nin the course of the fight; that he resorted to methods of violence in\r\nsome instances; and that he fought to kill, rather than to reform, may\r\nbe admitted. But the very nature of the fight he waged compelled the\r\nBank to disclose its tremendous power over the prosperity of the people.\r\nNo matter what they may have thought in the beginning, no one could have\r\ndoubted toward the end that the Bank did have the power to precipitate\r\npanics, to punish the people for legislation it resented, to dominate,\r\nin the end, the legislation of the future by the threat of reprisal upon\r\nthe business of the Nation. No one, in 1834, doubted that the National\r\nBank, in the hands of a man like Biddle domineering over pliant\r\ndirectors, and assuming dictatorial authority over the members of\r\nCongress, possessed powers incompatible with the preservation of the\r\nrights and liberties of the people. From that day on, the Bank has had\r\nits apologists among historians, and Jackson has been excoriated as an\r\nignorant usurper, but there has never been a time since when the\r\nAmerican people would have tolerated a return to the system that was\r\ndestroyed. Through several years the country was to be disturbed by the\r\nsometimes stumbling processes of transition from the old to the new\r\nsystem, but the Bank fight ended with the verdict of the polls in 1834.\r\nOnly the censure of the Senate remained to poison the mind of the iron\r\nman in the White House. The Bank lingered on, a little while, under the\r\nlaws of Pennsylvania, and then crashed to the earth, ruining many of its\r\nsupporters.[775] And on the banker’s death, Hone copied into his diary\r\nthe comment of William Cullen Bryant in the “New York Evening Post,”\r\nthat Biddle “died at his country seat where he passed the last of his\r\ndays in elegant retirement, which, if justice had taken place, would\r\nhave been spent in the penitentiary.”[776]\r\n\r\nThe prolonged battle has left a lasting impression upon the political\r\nlife and methods of the Republic. It aroused, as never before, that\r\nclass consciousness, to which politicians have ever since appealed; it\r\ngave dignity to demagogy, and made it pay. It marked the beginning of\r\nthe active participation of powerful corporations, as such, in the\r\npolitics of the country, witnessed the adoption of the methods of\r\nintimidation and coercion, of systematic propaganda, of the\r\nsubsidization of disreputable newspapers. From that day on, the powerful\r\ncorporation has been anathema to the masses, monopoly has been a red\r\nrag, and the contest between capital and labor has been a reality. If\r\nthis has been unfortunate, the fault has been no less with Clay, who\r\nsought and made the issue, and with Biddle and his arrogant reliance on\r\nthe power of money, than with Jackson and the Kitchen Cabinet who\r\nchallenged the political pretensions of the Bank.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nThe Whig leaders entered upon the congressional session of December in a\r\nbitter mood. Calhoun was especially vicious and in a chronic rage\r\nagainst the President and the Administration. The fury of the Whigs was\r\nnot moderated by the fact that State Legislatures were beginning to\r\ndemand the expunging from the records of the resolution of censure.\r\nBenton, in the previous session, had served notice of his intention to\r\nmove to expunge, and the Kitchen Cabinet in the meanwhile had been busy\r\nin building backfires against the offending Senators among their\r\nconstituents. The first State to act was Alabama. The day before Senator\r\nKing presented the Alabama resolutions, during a running discussion of\r\nthe revelations of mismanagement and crookedness in the Post-Office\r\nDepartment, Senator Preston suggested that the Senate should censure\r\nsome one. Just whom he would censure was not made clear, but he did\r\nrefer to the previous declaration of Jackson that he was responsible for\r\nthe Executive departments. “Does any one doubt the turpitude of the\r\nPost-Office?” asked Preston. “When hardly the age of man, it is found\r\nsteeped in corruption the most foul, the most melancholy. If the\r\nPresident is responsible, and the officers acted improperly, is this the\r\nhouse to present the subject? And shall we stand by without saying or\r\ndoing anything in regard to the present state of things in that\r\ndepartment?”\r\n\r\nCalhoun was instantly on his feet. He had listened to the report on the\r\nPost-Office “with sorrow and deep mortification.” After twenty-two years\r\nof connection with the Government he was able to say that “in all that\r\ntime the charges of corruption against all the departments of the\r\nGovernment that he had ever heard of were not equal to the disclosures\r\nhere made.” In truth he thought that “the exhibition would disgrace the\r\nrottenest age of the Roman Republic.” He hoped some resolution would be\r\npresented.\r\n\r\nThis implied threat was not lost on the ever alert Benton, and on the\r\nfollowing day he took the floor, reminded the Senate of his promise,\r\ndeclared that nothing less than the expurgation of the offensive censure\r\nwould suffice, and served notice of his intention to present the\r\nresolution. This opened the first debate on expurgation. Clay, with a\r\npersonal fling at Benton, saltily expressed the hope that before acting\r\nthe Missourian would carefully examine the Constitution, and concluded\r\nthat he would “oppose such a resolution at the very threshold.” Preston\r\nconceded that his party had been “beaten down,” and demanded to know\r\nwhether “everything that we have done shall be expunged.” Calhoun would\r\n“like to see a resolution which proposed to repeal the journal--to\r\nrepeal a fact.” If the thing could be done, “the Senate itself could be\r\nexpunged,” and the Government itself was at an end. He was “anxious to\r\nsee who would attempt to carry out the doctrines of the Protest of last\r\nyear--doctrines as despotic as those which were held by the autocrat of\r\nall the Russias.”\r\n\r\nTo this, King took vigorous exception. The resolution of censure was not\r\n“a fact.” “The Democracy of this land has spoken and pronounced its\r\ncondemnation of the proceeding.” He had hoped, when Calhoun declared on\r\na previous occasion that he would act for the country, he would have\r\nlittle more to do with party, but he had since manifested a very\r\ndifferent feeling. Stung by the taunt, Calhoun made no half-hearted\r\ndenial of partisan bias. “I have no purpose to serve,” he said. “I have\r\nno desire to be here.” And then, with evident insincerity, he added,\r\n“Sir, I would not turn upon my heel to be entrusted with the management\r\nof the Government.”[777]\r\n\r\nWhen, a few weeks later, the day before the expiration of the session,\r\nthe discussion was renewed, Hugh Lawson White, now rapidly cooling to\r\nfrigidity toward Jackson, moved to amend Benton’s resolution by striking\r\nout the word “expunge” and substituting “rescind, reverse, and to make\r\nnull and void.” This incident has been given an historical importance\r\nbeyond its due by many who have attributed to the motion the final break\r\nbetween Jackson and White. The action of the Tennessee Senator\r\nunquestionably outraged the Jacksonians, who ascribed it to hostility,\r\nbut such was not the dominating motive. He took the position that he\r\ncould not vote to “obliterate and deface the journal of the Senate.”\r\nBenton protested that the word “expunge” was strictly parliamentary. To\r\nhis astonishment and chagrin, he discovered that White was not the only\r\nDemocrat who objected to his phrasing of the resolution, as others\r\ncrowded about him to urge the acceptance of the amendment. Finding\r\nhimself almost deserted, he afterwards said that he “yielded a\r\nmortifying and reluctant consent.”[778] All this the proud Missourian\r\ncould stand. But when Webster immediately arose, and, after sounding the\r\npæan of triumph, moved that the resolution be laid upon the table; and\r\nafter Clay and Calhoun had spoken with bitterness and contempt, the\r\nspirit of compromise died out in his heart, and he then and there\r\npromised himself to continue the battle. The debate was acrimonious in\r\nspirit, and in the midst of “great excitement.”[779] This was the\r\npreliminary battle which was to have a spectacular ending in a\r\nJacksonian triumph a short time before the expiration of the iron man’s\r\nPresidency.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nTo the Jacksonians, the most distressing feature of the short session\r\nwas the disclosure of the utter incompetency, blackened by positive\r\ncrookedness, in the rapidly growing Post-Office Department, which called\r\nfor the management of a man of more than ordinary organizing and\r\nbusiness ability. Major Barry possessed neither qualification. An honest\r\nman himself, without the slightest business sense, easily imposed upon,\r\nsurrounded by subordinates who were scamps, and forced to deal with mail\r\ncontractors who were criminals, he lost control early in his\r\nadministration. When the Clayton investigation was completed, the\r\ndepartment was found honeycombed with fraud, plastered with forgeries,\r\nand in a hopeless financial condition. And yet no one seriously\r\nsuspected Barry of complicity. Clay, who had lost the support of Harry,\r\nhis neighbor in Lexington, on the “bargain” story, did not hesitate to\r\nexonerate him from culpability. But there was no defense for the\r\nconditions, and Jackson, in his Message, had recommended a complete\r\nreorganization of the department better to safeguard the public\r\ninterest. The two parties stood together on the Reorganization Bill, and\r\nno member of either party attempted any justification of the conditions.\r\nBut the Democrats were on their toes throughout the-session to prevent\r\nany personal condemnation of either Barry or Jackson. The Whigs lost no\r\nopportunity to capitalize the scandal. The public money had been\r\nsquandered. Crooked contractors had been permitted to loot the Treasury.\r\nThey did not know the extent of the corruption, nor the responsibility\r\nof the head of the department, but they did know that the putridity of\r\nthe thing had never been approached in American history. The majority\r\nreport of the investigating committee found a deficit of $800.000; the\r\nminority placed the amount at $300,000; but both agreed that it was due\r\nin part at least to maladministration.[780] Felix Grundy, who had charge\r\nfor the Administration, rejoiced in the fact, “to the honor of his\r\ncountrymen,” that no one “had been found to accuse the\r\nPostmaster-General of corruption”;[781] and Senator Bibb of Kentucky, a\r\nsupporter of Clay, paid tribute to the personal qualities of Barry and\r\nascribed the failure to “the good disposition and kindness” of the head\r\nof the department, which had been imposed upon by “interested and\r\nselfish persons to further their own private interests.” Thus, in the\r\nSenate, the debate on the Reorganization Bill was conducted with decorum\r\nand without exciting personalities. An utter lack of system, a director\r\ndeficient in business sense and over-credulous, and all preyed upon by\r\ndishonest subordinates and criminally inclined speculators--such was the\r\nsense of the Senate.\r\n\r\nBut in the House, Barry’s personal integrity was not to go unchallenged.\r\nIn the lower branch he was unfortunate in friends who loved, not wisely,\r\nbut too well, who thought to prevent assault by challenging it. Some of\r\nthese had avowed a disposition to consider such an assault a personal\r\noffense. During a night session, William C. Johnson of Maryland, a\r\npromising and eloquent young Whig of imposing personal appearance,\r\nsought an opportunity to affront Representative Hawes of Kentucky, a\r\nmember of the special dueling club. An insignificant incident during the\r\ndiscussion of a post-route bill sufficed. On obtaining the floor,\r\nJohnson looked significantly at Hawes, and with sinister deliberation\r\nbegan: “It has been broadly hinted by some gentlemen ... that he who\r\nshall have the temerity to criticize the acts of the Postmaster-General\r\nmust answer therefor elsewhere than in this hall.... Sir, I come from a\r\nportion of the country where the law of personal responsibility is\r\nrecognized among gentlemen. I hold myself amenable to that law ...; and\r\nnow, in the face of those menaces which have been thrown out on this\r\nfloor, and intending to be responsible for what I am about to say, I\r\ndeclare that the Post-Office Department is corrupt from head to foot,\r\nthrough and through, and I believe that the head of the department,\r\nWilliam T. Barry, is as culpable as any officer under his control.”\r\n\r\nThe House was instantly in an uproar as Hawes rose to ask if Johnson\r\nmeant that the department was corrupt from Barry down. The young blade\r\nfrom Maryland jauntily replied in the affirmative. Hawes said that Barry\r\nwas “as honest and honorable as any man who has a seat on this floor,”\r\nand asked Johnson for the grounds for his charge. In the spirit of\r\nswashbuckler he had set out to be, the latter merely reiterated what he\r\nhad said. There was no misunderstanding the meaning of the situation--it\r\nmeant a duel unless Johnson would agree to a qualification of his\r\nstatement. To all such appeals he was adamant. When, as a result, he was\r\nchallenged by Barry’s son, he began to hedge with the demand that the\r\nduel take place “immediately.” He would not even consent to a day’s\r\ndelay, and young Barry withdrew the challenge. The incident proved\r\nnothing except that in the Thirties young men carried chips on their\r\nshoulders, and bandied words lightly.\r\n\r\nThe contemporaries of Barry exonerated him, and history has acquiesced\r\nin their verdict.[782] But it was apparent that his usefulness in the\r\nCabinet was over. He had never been qualified. While the debate on the\r\nReorganization Bill was still in progress, Jackson summoned Amos Kendall\r\nto the task of assuming charge and placing the department on a business\r\nbasis. At that time, the wizard of the Kitchen Cabinet, in ill health,\r\nand without private means, was planning to retire from the public\r\nservice to serve his family more satisfactorily in a financial way. He\r\ndemurred--Jackson insisted--and in the end, like the good soldier that\r\nhe was, he yielded.\r\n\r\nBarry, gracefully let out with the mission to Spain, sailed away, to die\r\nin London on the way, and Kendall took charge. It is amazing that the\r\nparty prejudices of ninety years ago should still persist and refuse\r\njustice to the genius of this exceptional man. Professor MacDonald does\r\nnot overstate when he describes him “as a man of remarkable\r\nadministrative power.”[783] Nor is it probable that so seasoned an\r\nobserver of public men as Senator Foote was unduly impressed when he\r\ndescribed him as “discoursing upon the gravest and most important\r\nquestions with a profundity and power which left a lasting\r\nimpress.”[784] Brilliant with the pen, sagacious beyond almost any man\r\nof his time as a politician, wise in counsel, and yet capable of\r\nmanaging the dry-as-dust details of the most practical of departments,\r\nAmos Kendall is probably one of the greatest all-around publicists the\r\nRepublic has produced.\r\n\r\nHis first step on taking charge was thoroughly to familiarize himself\r\nwith the minute details of his office, with the special functions of\r\neach subordinate, and the character of the man. He soon discovered the\r\nsecret of the good-natured Barry’s undoing, when a clerk, suspected of\r\nhaving relations with a contractor as agent, approached him\r\ningratiatingly with the announcement that he “had control of funds and\r\nwould be happy to accommodate him with loans.” He was promptly\r\ndischarged.[785] After a thorough survey, Kendall concluded that “a few\r\npowerful mail contractors, through favors to the officers and more\r\ninfluential clerks, had really controlled the department, and for their\r\nown selfish ends, and been the cause of all its embarrassments.”[786] He\r\nadopted stringent rules for the guidance of employees. The acceptance of\r\na gift was to mean dismissal. So, too, with free rides on stage-coaches,\r\nsteamboats, or railroad cars carrying mail. Applying the rules as\r\nrigidly to himself as to others, he promptly returned all presents and\r\nfree tickets, and thenceforward the Postmaster-General paid his way. But\r\nthe task confronting him was tremendous. The department was deeply in\r\ndebt and was sinking deeper. Not satisfied with the showing of\r\ncorruption by the congressional committee, he went over the ground and\r\nuncovered crookedness it had overlooked. The postmaster of New York was\r\ncaught in the net and instantly dismissed. Some powerful and influential\r\ncontractors who had carried the mail between Washington and Philadelphia\r\nwere suspected, and Kendall made a searching investigation. Major Barry,\r\nstill in Washington at this time, became seriously disturbed, and\r\nconceived the notion that his successor was bent on embarrassing him,\r\nand Kendall, who had no suspicion of his predecessor, sent for him and\r\npersonally reassured him. But there were other embarrassments within the\r\nAdministration household. Mrs. Eaton, then in Washington, and intimate\r\nwith the family of one of the contractors who was pressing a claim that\r\nKendall was examining, called one day on Mrs. Kendall with the bald\r\nproposition that if the claim were allowed, the contractor would present\r\nthe wife of the Postmaster-General with “a carriage and a pair of\r\nhorses.” The incident was promptly reported to Kendall, who recorded the\r\nstory many years later.[787] Applying himself and his administrative\r\ngenius diligently to his task, driving out the incompetent and corrupt,\r\npracticing economy while extending the scope of the department’s\r\nservices, he soon put it on a paying basis, and before the expiration of\r\nJackson’s Administration, less than two years later, wiped out the\r\ndeficit. This is the man some historians have described as a vulgar\r\npolitician and a “printer.”\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nNo incident of this session so well illustrates the partisan bitterness\r\nand the venomous nature of the hates engendered by the struggles of the\r\npreceding years as the attempt on the life of Jackson at the Capitol on\r\nJanuary 30, 1835.[788] Under normal conditions and in ordinary times the\r\nincident would have been dismissed, and, properly, ascribed to the\r\ninsanity of the assailant. But it was the first time an attempt had been\r\nmade upon the life of a President--and it was a President who had been\r\nintemperately denounced as a tyrant, despot, and wrecker of American\r\ninstitutions and liberties. Just as John Tyler had instantly thought of\r\n“political effect,”[789] the ardent friends of Jackson caught the same\r\nidea from the opposite angle. And two days later, Frank Blair in the\r\n“Globe” threw out the suggestion of a conspiracy. “Whether Lawrence [the\r\nassailant] has caught, in his visits to the Capitol, the mania which has\r\nprevailed the last two sessions of the Senate,” he wrote, “whether he\r\nhas become infatuated with the chimeras which have troubled the brains\r\nof the disappointed and ambitious orators who have depicted the\r\nPresident as a Cæsar who ought to have a Brutus; as a Cromwell, a Nero,\r\na Tiberius, we know not. If no secret conspiracy has prompted the\r\nperpetration of the horrid deed, we think it not improbable that some\r\ndelusion of intellect has grown out of his visits to the Capitol, and\r\nthat hearing despotism and every horrible mischief threatened to the\r\nRepublic, and revolution and all its train of calamities imputed as the\r\nnecessary consequence of the President’s measures, it may be that the\r\ninfatuated man fancied that he had reason to become his country’s\r\navenger. If he had heard and believed Mr. Calhoun’s speech of day before\r\nyesterday, he would have found in it ample justification for his attempt\r\non one who was represented as the cause of the most dreadful calamities\r\nof the Nation; as one who made perfect rottenness and corruption to\r\npervade the vitals of the Government, insomuch that it was scarcely\r\nworth preserving, if it were possible.”[790]\r\n\r\nThe intimation here thrown out was bitterly resented by the Opposition\r\nleaders, and particularly by Calhoun, who was mentioned. The very fact\r\nthat the intemperate and insincere denunciations of high officials as\r\nresponsible for the distress of the people, acting upon the diseased\r\nbrain, can very easily persuade the madman to constitute himself the\r\nexecutioner, served to infuriate the orators who had given themselves\r\nfull play. Stung to the quick, Calhoun denounced the “Globe” as “base\r\nand prostitute,” and described it as “the authentic and established\r\norgan” of Jackson, “sustained by his power and pampered by his\r\nhands.” “To what are we coming?” he exclaimed. “We are told that\r\nto denounce the abuse of the Administration even in general terms,\r\nwithout personal reference, is to instigate the assassination of the\r\nChief Executive.... I have made up my mind as to my duty. I am no\r\ncandidate for any office--I neither seek nor desire place--nothing\r\nshall intimidate--nothing shall prevent me from doing what I believe is\r\ndue to my conscience and my country.”[791] Mr. Calhoun sat down--and\r\nMr. Leigh immediately rose to present a report from the Committee on\r\nRevolutionary Claims.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Calhoun’s attack on the “Globe” was not unnoticed by Blair, who\r\nreplied by quoting from the most venomous portions of Calhoun’s and\r\nPreston’s tirades on the Post-Office report. A week later the\r\nAdministration organ was still harping on conspiracy. “Every hour,”\r\nwrote Blair, “brings new proof to show that Lawrence has been operated\r\non to seek the President’s life, precisely as we had supposed from the\r\nmoment we learned that he had been an attendant on the debates in\r\nCongress.”[792]\r\n\r\nVery soon the capital was startled with the connection of Senator\r\nPoindexter’s name with that of the assailant. The obsession took\r\npossession of Jackson that his Mississippi enemy had instigated the\r\nattempt at assassination. The examination of Lawrence had clearly\r\nestablished his insanity; just as clearly shown that he had taken to\r\nheart the charges of Jackson’s enemies that he was responsible for the\r\ndistress of the people. Finding himself hard pressed by fate, and\r\nascribing his unhappiness to the tyranny of Jackson, he had determined\r\nto kill him. That explanation was convincing and sufficient. But the\r\nsuggestion that Poindexter had planned the deed fell on receptive soil.\r\nAffidavits had been placed in Jackson’s hands to the effect that “a\r\ngentleman who boarded in the same house informed him that Mr.\r\nPoindexter had interviews with Lawrence but a few days before the\r\nattempt on the President’s life.” Some time before the attack, “a\r\ncaptain in high standing in the navy” had said that Poindexter, on a\r\nvoyage to New Orleans, had threatened to demand personal satisfaction of\r\nJackson, and if he refused “he would shoot him wherever he saw him.”\r\nThis had caused such anxiety to Jackson’s friends that the Reverend Mr.\r\nHatch, chaplain of the Senate, had personally informed Jackson of the\r\nthreat. All this, followed, after the assault, with an affidavit that\r\nLawrence had been seen to “go repeatedly to Poindexter’s residence,”\r\nthoroughly convinced Jackson, who appears to have been in a morbid\r\ncondition like his enemies.[793] He excitedly charged it in conversation\r\nwith callers at the White House. Miss Martineau, who was friendly with\r\nthe Poindexters, and apparently fond of the Senator, was literally\r\nforced to leave the White House by the abusive denunciation of the\r\nMississippian. She became his ardent partisan, and took pains to record\r\nin her book that, on visiting the Poindexters on the night of the\r\nassault, she had “greatly admired the moderation with which Mr.\r\nPoindexter spoke of his foe.”[794]\r\n\r\nHearing from many quarters of Jackson’s charges, Poindexter wrote him\r\nthat he would discredit the reports unless confirmed by the President,\r\nbut that a failure to reply would be accepted as a confirmation. Jackson\r\ndisplayed Poindexter’s letter to visitors, but made no response. Thus a\r\nperfectly foolish notion of Jackson’s was forced to an issue. To\r\nunderstand the feeling behind it all, and to appreciate the bitter\r\nhostility of Poindexter, to which frequent reference has been made, it\r\nis necessary to know more of the character and career of this really\r\nremarkable but tragic figure.\r\n\r\nGeorge Poindexter was something of a genius, and, until his break with\r\nJackson, an idol of Mississippi. From the beginning he had been\r\naccorded the leadership of the Democratic or Jeffersonian Party in that\r\nTerritory. His early congressional career was a justification of his\r\nleadership. One who knew him in those days tells us that “his mind was\r\nlogical and strong; his conception was quick and acute; his powers of\r\ncombination and application were astonishing; his wit was pointed and\r\ncaustic, and his sarcasm overwhelming.”[795] These qualities made him a\r\ntremendous power upon the stump with the then primitive people of his\r\nState. In the gubernatorial office he rendered invaluable service which\r\nstrengthened his hold upon the masses. On the bench, he was noted for\r\nhis ability and justice, and, among the lawyers, he was conceded to have\r\nfew equals before a jury. During the War of 1812 he had further endeared\r\nhimself to the Mississippians by his patriotic appeal for preparation,\r\nand, after he had aroused the Territory to fever heat, and Jackson had\r\nappeared upon the scene, he became a volunteer aid upon the staff of the\r\nfuture President. It was to Poindexter that the negro or soldier carried\r\nthe infamous British countersign, “Booty and Beauty,” and it was\r\nPoindexter who conveyed it to Jackson. Later his enemies charged that he\r\nhad forged it to win the favor of the General. That such a man should\r\nhave made enemies was inevitable. So bitter were his denunciations of\r\nhis political enemies, so unscrupulous his use of terms, that at one\r\ntime a conspiracy was formed to force him into a duel and kill him. The\r\nopportunity came after a peculiarly vitriolic attack upon a wealthy\r\nmerchant who affiliated with the Federalists. The merchant challenged\r\nand was killed. Then Poindexter’s enemies charged that he had fired\r\nbefore the word was given.\r\n\r\nNowhere in the campaign of 1828 did Jackson receive more ardent support\r\nthan in Mississippi where his old friend Poindexter directed his forces,\r\nand one year after his inauguration, the lieutenant entered the Senate,\r\nand almost immediately the feud between the erstwhile friends began.\r\nThe sordid feature of the story is the fact that it grew out of a\r\npatronage controversy. Jackson had determined on the appointment of a\r\nTennesseean, a neighbor of the Hermitage, to the land office of\r\nMississippi. Poindexter protested that this patronage belonged to his\r\nState and to him. Jackson refused to yield. Poindexter prevented the\r\nconfirmation of the Tennesseean. Jackson made a recess appointment, and\r\nthenceforward the two comrades of 1812 were at swords’ points. Thus far\r\nJackson was manifestly in the wrong. His loyalty to friendship cannot\r\nexplain his disloyalty to Poindexter--who was also a friend, and a\r\nfriend in need. But such was the Mississippian’s prejudice and hate that\r\nhe abandoned, not only the President and purely Administration measures,\r\nbut the principles he had espoused and advocated for a generation. He\r\ncrossed the Rubicon, burned the bridges, and became a special favorite\r\nof Clay’s. In every great fight of the Jackson period, Poindexter was\r\nfound arrayed with the Opposition. He stood with the Bank, favored the\r\ncensure, and offered the resolutions denunciatory of the Protest. In the\r\nNullification contest, he had essayed to lead the Nullifiers, and became\r\nmore offensive than Calhoun.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for Poindexter, in the fighting that followed he was far\r\nfrom invulnerable on the personal side. Having been unfortunate in his\r\ndomestic relations, he had divorced his wife, denied the paternity of\r\nhis children, and plunged into the most reckless dissipation.[796] His\r\nindecent reflections upon the purity of his wife drove her family,\r\nextensive and influential, to his enemies; his intemperate tirades\r\nagainst Jackson alienated the dominant Democratic sentiment of the\r\nState; and while he fought boldly and bitterly to sustain himself, he\r\nfailed, and, at the time of the attack on Jackson by the madman at the\r\nCapitol, was so discredited in Mississippi that he was planning to leave\r\nthe State, with his second wife, on the expiration of his term. A man\r\nof genius whose morals failed to sustain his mentality--such the epitaph\r\nof George Poindexter.[797]\r\n\r\nThree weeks after Lawrence had fired and failed, Poindexter called the\r\nSenate’s attention to an anonymous letter stating that affidavits were\r\nin the hands of the President charging that interviews had taken place\r\nbetween the assailant and himself a few days before the attempt on\r\nJackson’s life, and asking the appointment of a special committee of\r\ninvestigation. Henry Clay, avowing that the rumors “inspired him with\r\nnothing but the deepest mortification and regret,” and that it was\r\n“impossible to credit the statement that affidavits should have been\r\nprocured at the instance of the Chief Executive for the purpose of\r\nimplicating a Senator of the United States in so foul a transaction,”\r\nreluctantly consented to an investigation. Without further discussion, a\r\ncommittee, consisting of John Tyler, chairman, Smith, Mangum, King, and\r\nSilas Wright, was appointed, with permission to sit during the sessions\r\nof the Senate; and three days later it unanimously exonerated Poindexter\r\nfrom suspicion. Webster asked for the yeas and nays on its acceptance;\r\nevery Senator voted yea, and thus ended the most unfortunate incident in\r\nthe career of Andrew Jackson. The “Washington Globe,” which had\r\npublished the affidavits, wholly discredited them about the same\r\ntime.[798]\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nThe Calhoun inquiry “into the extent of federal patronage, the\r\ncircumstances which have contributed to its great increase of late, the\r\nexpediency and practicability of reducing the same, and the means of\r\nsuch reduction,” served further to fan the flames of partisan madness\r\nduring this session. Persisting in the fallacy that he was not moved by\r\npartisan or political considerations, he suggested that the committee be\r\ncomposed of two members of each party. The Senate, however, was not\r\ndeceived as to his purpose, and selected four enemies of the\r\nAdministration, Calhoun, Webster, Southard, and Bibb, and two Democrats,\r\nBenton, and King of Georgia. In due time an elaborate report was\r\nsubmitted. It set forth that 60,294 persons were in the employ of the\r\nGovernment; that together with the pensioners this meant more than\r\n100,000 dependent on the Treasury. Implying that these constituted a\r\nfederal machine, Calhoun added all engaged in business who wished to\r\nfurnish supplies as part of the organization, influenced by patronage.\r\nWorse--there were thousands who wished to get upon the pay-roll who\r\nwould willingly play the part of pliant tools to curry favor with\r\nExecutive power. And how was this to be remedied? Since one of the\r\ncauses contributing to the enlargement of the President’s patronage was\r\nthe increase in governmental expenditure, the statesmanlike thing to do\r\nwould be to reduce the revenue. A great amount of public land had been\r\nthrown upon the market, calling for an army of receivers, registers, and\r\nsurveyors--all of whom were tools of Jackson. The Jacksonian policy of\r\nremoving men from office to make way for henchmen had reduced the\r\nefficiency of the public service by making reappointments dependent on\r\nsomething other than faithful service. This, by making the officials\r\ndependent upon the President, tended to make them all subservient to his\r\nwill, and little better than his slaves. More: the power assumed by the\r\nPresident to select the banks for the public deposits made them a part\r\nof the presidential machine. If the public revenue could be reduced, and\r\nthe Government thus starved, many would be forced from the public crib,\r\nbut unhappily this could not be done. He proposed, therefore, a\r\nconstitutional amendment permitting the annual distribution of the\r\nsurplus till 1843 by a division of it into as many shares as there were\r\nSenators and Representatives, with ten shares for each Territory and the\r\nDistrict of Columbia. And in addition to all this, he would enact a law\r\nto regulate the deposits of public money, and another to repeal that\r\npart of the Act of 1820 which limited the terms of customs officers.\r\n\r\nWhen the report was submitted to the Senate, Poindexter made it the\r\noccasion for mournful and indignant reflections upon the growing tyranny\r\nof Jackson. He was profoundly moved by the revelations. Surely as many\r\nas thirty thousand extra copies of the report should be published for\r\ndistribution. “The question now submitted to the Nation,” he said, “is\r\nwhether power is to be perpetuated in the hands of him who now wields\r\nit, and the one he may select as his successor.” It was most unfortunate\r\nthat the people would not awaken to the sinister attacks upon their\r\nliberties and institutions. The thoughtful, however, could not but see\r\nthe trend.\r\n\r\nBut why print thirty thousand copies, asked King of Georgia, if not to\r\nserve a party purpose at the expense of the taxpayers? “What a spectacle\r\nwe do present from day to day!” he exclaimed. “The Senate has been a\r\nweek making war on the extras of the Post-Office Department. We are now\r\nwarring against the extravagance of the Executive; and whilst\r\nbrandishing the sword in one hand in defense of the public Treasury\r\nagainst the ravages of the Executive, we are, with the other, slipping\r\nit into our own pockets, or scattering it in profuse and wasteful\r\nextravagance.”\r\n\r\nThe Senate compromised on ten thousand copies, and a rather dull debate,\r\nin which the Bank question was revived, resulted. The bills proposed by\r\nthe Whig committee passed the Whig Senate to be promptly rejected in the\r\nDemocratic House. These measures merely served as pegs on which to hang\r\nfurther denunciations of Jackson and his policies.\r\n\r\nAnd the Democrats countered with an enthusiastic banquet in celebration\r\nof the wiping-out of the national debt for the first time in history.\r\nThis had been one of Jackson’s ambitions--a consummation Clay had\r\ndetermined should not come before the presidential election of 1832. But\r\nit could not be prevented; and while the Whigs were expanding on\r\nextravagance and the crowded public crib, the Jacksonians were pointing\r\nto the extinguishment of the public debt as an answer to the attacks.\r\nBenton, who presided as toastmaster at the banquet, was in flamboyant\r\nmood.\r\n\r\n“The national debt is paid,” he said. “This month of January, 1835, in\r\nthe fifty-eighth year of the Republic, Andrew Jackson being President,\r\nthe national debt is paid, and the apparition, so long unseen on\r\nearth--a great nation without a national debt--stands revealed to the\r\nastonished vision of a wondering world. Gentlemen, my heart is in this\r\ndouble celebration, and I offer you a sentiment, which, coming directly\r\nfrom my own bosom, will find its response in yours: President Jackson:\r\nmay the evening of his days be as tranquil and as happy for himself as\r\ntheir meridian has been resplendent, glorious, and beneficent for his\r\ncountry.”\r\n\r\nSuch was the partisan madness of this short session that a resolution,\r\noffered and urged by Preston, the Whig, for the purchase of some\r\npictures for “the President’s house,” was promptly voted down, and\r\nPreston’s efforts to have the vote reconsidered were unavailing. It was\r\ninto this madhouse of partisan rancor that the French crisis,\r\nthreatening war, involving the world prestige of the Republic, had been\r\nthrown by Jackson; and we shall now note how nearly partisanship came to\r\ncompromising and weakening the Nation in the face of a foreign\r\nantagonist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nWHIG DISLOYALTY IN FRENCH CRISIS\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe most important battle of the short session of 1834-35 was waged over\r\nJackson’s determination to compel France to observe her obligations\r\nunder the treaty signed in Paris and Washington in July, 1831. After\r\nfutile efforts by the four preceding Administrations to bring France to\r\nthe payment of an indemnity for losses to American vessels during the\r\nNapoleonic wars, Jackson succeeded in negotiating a treaty in which\r\nFrance stipulated to pay the United States five millions in six annual\r\ninstallments, and we agreed to the reduction of duties on French wines.\r\nWe immediately conformed to our agreement, but the French manifested no\r\nsuch respect for their obligations. Several sessions of the French\r\nChamber failed to make appropriations for the payments, notwithstanding\r\nthe earnest remonstrances of Washington. Thoroughly vexed at the\r\ncontemptuous indifference of Paris, Jackson withdrew Livingston from the\r\nState Department, and sent him to the French Court to insist upon the\r\ndischarge of the treaty obligations. Before the crisis came, he had\r\nsummoned to his side as Secretary of State the courtly and able John\r\nForsyth, concerning whom the American people know all too little. In\r\nview of the tendency to picture the Jackson of the French crisis as a\r\nbull in a china shop, it is worth while to consider the characters of\r\nthe men who were, at this time, his advisers in foreign affairs. The\r\ncharacter of Livingston has been described.\r\n\r\nIn the Washington of the Thirties no public man was more generally\r\nrespected and admired for ability and elegance of manner than the new\r\nSecretary of State. This courtliness\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN FORSYTH]\r\n\r\nof demeanor was an inheritance from his French ancestors.[799] In person\r\nhe was notably handsome, well built, with classical features; and his\r\nmanners were those of the drawing-room and the Court. One who knew him\r\nhas written that “in the times of Louis XIV he would have rivaled the\r\nmost celebrated courtier; and under the dynasty of Napoleon he would\r\nhave won the baton of France.”[800] Another has described him as “Lord\r\nChesterfield, minus his powdered wig and knee buckles,” and as “all duke\r\nand all democrat.”[801] Even-tempered, seldom giving way to passion,\r\nrich in a sense of humor, he was one of the few statesmen of his time\r\nwho could find an equal welcome in the drawing-rooms of Whigs or\r\nDemocrats. He was intensely social, and prone to fritter away valuable\r\ntime in polite conversation with the pretty women of the capital, albeit\r\na perfect husband, ardently devoted to the accomplished daughter of Dr.\r\nJosiah Meigs, whom he had married.[802] Cultivated, polished, graceful,\r\nhe was the perfect gentleman and conversationalist.\r\n\r\nAs an orator, he was one of the most consummate of his time, singularly\r\nfree from the then prevailing vice of tearing a passion to tatters. With\r\na glance of the eye, a movement of the finger, a mild gesture of the\r\nhand, he could convey subtle meaning, and in his expressions of contempt\r\nhe required nothing more than a twitch of the Roman nose or a scornful\r\ncurl of the lip.[803] His voice, rich and musical, was as carefully\r\ntrained as that of a prima donna. One writer compared it to a trumpet,\r\n“clear and piercing in its tones, and yet as soft as an organ.”[804]\r\nAnother, referring to “the constant stream of pure vocalization,”\r\ndescribed it as “clear and resonant, always pleasant to the ear, and\r\nperfectly modulated.”[805] A contemporary writer for the “Boston Post”\r\nrecorded that “the rhythmic accents of his voice suggested the musical\r\nnotes of the Æolian harp.”[806]\r\n\r\nBy the common verdict of all contemporaries he was the most powerful\r\ndebater of his day, and as the floor leader in the Senate, he was a\r\ntower of strength to the Administration before entering the Cabinet. A\r\ncompetent critic wrote that “as an impromptu debater to bring on an\r\naction or to cover a retreat, he never had a superior”; was “acute, full\r\nof resources, and ever prompt--impetuous as Murat in charge, adroit as\r\nSoult when flanked and outnumbered,” “haughty in the presence of\r\nenemies, and affable and winning among friends.”[807] Another thought\r\nhim as adroit a debater as ever lived--“the Ajax Telamon of his\r\nparty.”[808] When the fight was made against the confirmation of Van\r\nBuren, the Administration rested its case against the attacks of Clay\r\nand Webster on his presentation. In the campaign of 1832, it summoned\r\nhim to make the one speech upon the tariff, and then dismissed the topic\r\ndefinitely. When, at a critical moment in the Nullification movement,\r\nGeorgia was about to be swept into the fallacy under the leadership of\r\nBerrien, in a convention called specifically for that purpose, it was\r\nForsyth who was dispatched to take charge of the Administration forces,\r\nand, under his brilliant management, the Nullifiers were defeated in the\r\npresence of Chancellor Harper, who had been summoned from South Carolina\r\nto witness the triumph of the sinister doctrine.[809] During the panic\r\nsession, it was upon his sarcasm that the Jacksonians largely relied to\r\nminimize the effect of the exaggerated speeches and the lugubrious\r\npetitions and memorials.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, ardent though he was in his partisanship, he commanded the\r\naffectionate esteem of his opponents by his manliness and fairness. When\r\nthe “bargain” charge was made against Clay, it was Forsyth who demanded\r\nan investigation in the interest of justice, thereby incurring the\r\ndispleasure of many of his associates. Even Adams found him fair.\r\n\r\nIn many respects he fails to fit in with the Jacksonian picture. He was\r\ntemperamentally an aristocrat, like Livingston, rather cynical toward\r\nthe masses, and not at all enamoured of the Kitchen Cabinet. The letter\r\nfrom his son-in-law during the first Cabinet dissensions, expressing the\r\nhope that Jackson would “send off Lewis and Kendall,” was doubtless\r\nwritten in the confidence that the sentiment would meet with the\r\napproval of the recipient.[810] But Forsyth was too much the man of the\r\nworld to quarrel over details or personalities, and in the company of\r\nVan Buren and Livingston, he was able to forget the Kendalls and the\r\nBlairs.\r\n\r\nWhen he entered the Cabinet, he assumed tasks that were to his taste. He\r\nprided himself particularly upon his diplomacy, and his experience as\r\nMinister to Madrid to negotiate the purchase of Florida justified his\r\nconfidence. This position called for great address, finesse, a knowledge\r\nof human nature, and infinite patience, persuasiveness, and tact. The\r\ncunning Ferdinand, who needed the money, but was loath to part with his\r\npossession, was inclined to haggle, and, while history has given credit\r\nfor the success of the negotiations to the instructions of Adams, it was\r\nthe ingratiating qualities of Forsyth that finally overcame the scruples\r\nof the King.\r\n\r\nThat a President so impetuous as Jackson should have been served in\r\nforeign affairs by men of the conservatism and caution of Van Buren,\r\nLivingston, and Forsyth seems providential. One day, after dinner,\r\nJackson sat before the fire in the White House smoking his pipe and\r\noutlining plans for radical action on the Oregon boundary dispute that\r\nwould have made war inevitable. Forsyth, to whom he was speaking,\r\nobserving his dangerous mood, simulated sympathy with his indignation.\r\nThen he began with quiet suggestions. Perhaps Jackson’s plan would seem\r\nto be a plan to force a fight. It might put the country in the wrong\r\nlight. Then, too, he recalled that the offensive action proposed in\r\nParliament had been dropped on the request of the British Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs. Possibly the London Government did not sympathize with\r\nthe faction seeking trouble. Again, a year’s notice would have to be\r\ngiven, preliminary to any action by the United States, and Jackson’s\r\nAdministration would then be drawing to a close. Possibly it might be\r\nbest to do nothing. The President sat a few moments looking into the\r\nfire, and then, slowly refilling and lighting his pipe, he concluded--“I\r\nreckon you’re right, Forsyth; at least you’re right now.”\r\n\r\nSuch was the man who, with the assistance of Edward Livingston, was to\r\ngrapple with the French crisis.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nOn presenting his credentials, Livingston was warmly received by Louis\r\nPhilippe, and assured that the necessary laws for the immediate\r\nexecution of the treaty would be passed at the next meeting of the\r\nChamber.[811] The French Government then understood the certain effect\r\non American public opinion of a contemptuous treatment of its\r\nobligations. The peculiar action of the Chamber had been the subject of\r\na conversation between the Duc de Broglie and James Buchanan, then in\r\nParis, _en route_ from his mission to St. Petersburg and this had been\r\nstressed.[812] Thanks to the clever Count Pozzo di Borgo, Russian\r\nMinister to France, Buchanan had been able to convey to Jackson an\r\naccurate idea of the difficulties--the weakness of the King’s\r\nGovernment and the hostility and cupidity of Dupin, the President of the\r\nChamber.[813] Nor did it take Livingston long to discover the secret of\r\nthe apathy of the King and his Ministers. Louis’s throne was a keg of\r\ndynamite, and he ruled in constant fear of the Deputies. He hoped to\r\npostpone an unpleasant duty until an auspicious moment. The treaty was\r\ndescribed by the enemies of the dynasty as a bad bargain; the supporters\r\nof the old régime hated America because of the Revolution, and the\r\nRepublicans hated the King because he was King. With Jackson manifesting\r\nmore and more irritation, Livingston importuned the King, remonstrated\r\nwith the Ministers, and labored with the members of the Chamber, and in\r\nall this he had the active coöperation of Lafayette. But after six\r\nmonths of conferences, the Chamber took adverse action.\r\n\r\nThe Government was seriously concerned. The King expressed his deep\r\nregret, and a French war vessel was sent to America with instructions to\r\nSerurier the French Minister, to assure Jackson that, as soon after the\r\nelections as the charter would permit, the Chamber would be summoned,\r\nthe appropriation would be pressed, and the President informed of the\r\nresult in time for him to communicate the facts to the Congress at the\r\nbeginning of the session of December, 1834. This held Jackson’s\r\nimpatience in check. But the elections passed, the Chamber convened,\r\nnothing was done, and the next session would not convene until three\r\nweeks after the Congress would meet.\r\n\r\nAs the congressional session approached, Livingston informed Forsyth\r\nthat only a manifestation of strong national feeling in America would\r\nforce action in Paris. “This is not a mere conjecture,” he wrote. “I\r\nknow the fact.” And he reiterated that the moderate tone of the\r\nPresident’s Messages had convinced the French politicians that he would\r\nnot be supported in vigorous measures, and closed with the significant\r\ncomment that “from all this you may imagine the anxiety I shall feel for\r\nthe arrival of the President’s Message.”[814]\r\n\r\nThe indignation of Jackson over this trifling, intensified by the\r\nconviction that France would not have dared thus in the case of a\r\nEuropean Power, can be imagined. Many of his friends who lived in\r\nconstant terror of his temper were beside themselves at the\r\nprospect.[815] But he had put his hand to the plough, and it was unlike\r\nhim to turn back. In the preparation of his Message a futile effort had\r\nbeen made to persuade him to the employment of less emphatic language,\r\nbut the Cabinet members thought to change slightly the phrasing without\r\nhis knowledge. Forsyth, who was a master in diplomatic wording, made\r\nslight changes in a paragraph, and the Message was sent to the “Globe”\r\nto be put in type. When the proof reached the White House, John C.\r\nRives[816] was with Jackson, and Donelson, a party to the plan to\r\nmoderate, began to read as Jackson, with his pipe in his mouth, paced\r\nthe floor. All went well until the altered paragraph was reached, and\r\nDonelson tried so to slur his reading that the change would not be\r\nnoticed. Vain hope! Jackson stopped short.\r\n\r\n“Read that again, sir.”\r\n\r\nThis time the secretary read distinctly, and Jackson, the lion in him\r\nthoroughly aroused, thundered:\r\n\r\n“That, sir, is not my language; it has been changed, and I will have no\r\nother expression of my own meaning than my own words.”\r\n\r\nAnd then and there he rewrote the paragraph, making it stronger than\r\noriginally. Then, placing it in the hands of Rives, he forbade him to\r\nprint anything else “at his peril.”[817]\r\n\r\nReading the Message to-day it seems moderate enough in tone, without a\r\ntrace of bluster, and, compared with Cleveland’s Venezuela Message,\r\npositively mild. The greater part is a calm, accurate, dispassionate\r\nrecital of the facts, but it closed with the request for authority for\r\nmaking reprisals on French property should the next session of the\r\nChamber fail to make the required appropriation. “Such a measure,” he\r\nsaid, “ought not to be considered by France as a menace. Her pride and\r\npower are too well known to expect anything from her fears, and preclude\r\nthe necessity of a declaration that nothing partaking of the character\r\nof intimidation is intended by us.”\r\n\r\nThe tone of the Message, appealing to the pride and self-respect of the\r\npeople, was embarrassing to the Whigs, who for a time hesitated as to\r\ntheir course. To support Jackson might only tend to enhance his\r\npopularity, already too great to suit; to attack his course would\r\ncertainly be disadvantageous to the country in an international\r\ncontroversy.[818] Hone, the Whig diarist, however, was quite sure that\r\nthe Message “will weaken our cause with the lookers on in other\r\nnations.”[819] A month later he was still depressed because of Jackson’s\r\n“unnecessary threats,” but, being a praying Whig, he had hopes that\r\nCongress would still save the country.[820] Justice Joseph Story was\r\nquite as mournful. “The President,” he wrote, “is exceedingly warm for\r\nwar with France if he could get Congress to back him. The Senate, in\r\nthese days our sole security, it is well known, would steadily resist\r\nhim.”[821]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, with the Whigs of the Senate laying their plans to repudiate\r\nthe President’s position in the face of a foreign adversary, events were\r\nmoving in France. The Chamber met in the midst of excitement, the\r\nMinistry successfully putting their popularity to the test of a vote of\r\nconfidence. Livingston was encouraged.[822] But a very little later his\r\noptimism vanished, and he awaited hopefully the arrival of the\r\nPresidential Message.[823] Thus concerned over the tone of the Message,\r\nhe arranged for couriers to hurry it to him on its arrival at Havre. It\r\nreached Paris in an American newspaper at two o’clock in the morning.\r\nThe excitement was intense. Even Livingston was momentarily stunned.\r\n“The feeling,” he wrote Forsyth, “is fostered by the language of our\r\nOpposition papers, particularly by the ‘Intelligencer’ and the ‘New York\r\nCourier,’ extracts from which have been sent on by Americans, declaring\r\nthem to be the sentiments of the majority of the people. These, as you\r\nwill see, are translated and republished here, with such comments as\r\nthey might have been expected and undoubtedly were intended to produce,\r\nand if hostilities should take place between the two nations those\r\npersons may flatter themselves with having the credit of a large share\r\nin producing them.” He felt, however, that “the energetic language of\r\nthe Message” would “have a good effect.” And contrary to the fear of\r\nHone that it would degrade us in the eyes of the onlookers, he found\r\nthat “it has certainly raised us in the estimation of other Powers if we\r\nmay judge by the demeanor of their representatives here.” He was sure\r\nthat “as soon as the excitement subsides it will operate favorably on\r\nthe counsels of France.” Already “some of the papers have begun to\r\nchange their tone.” As soon as the Message was known, “the funds\r\nexperienced a considerable fall, and insurance rose.”[824]\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the request of Comte de Rigny, the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs, Livingston personally delivered to him a copy of the\r\nMessage, and stressed the point that, under our governmental form, the\r\nMessage was a consultation between departments of our Government, and\r\nwas not directed to France. Then shifting to the offensive he added\r\nthat it was most unfortunate, in view of Serurier’s promise, that there\r\nhad not been an earlier call of the Chamber. De Rigny seemed to attach\r\nthe most serious importance to the intimation of bad faith, but the\r\ninterview was friendly. That evening, at the Austrian Minister’s,\r\nLivingston found him all suavity; and the next night a curt note from\r\nhim announced the withdrawal of Serurier from Washington, and a\r\nreadiness to give the American diplomat his passports on\r\napplication![825] He made much of Jackson’s comments on the failure to\r\nconvene the Chamber when, as a matter of fact, the Chamber was then\r\nactually assembled in virtue of a royal ordinance. This, while true,\r\ncould not have been known to Jackson in those days of slow\r\ncommunication. He only knew the original purpose. But it pleased de\r\nRigny to assume an unexplainable offense, and to announce that “His\r\nMajesty has considered it due his own dignity no longer to leave his\r\nMinister exposed to hear language so offensive to France.”[826]\r\nResisting an impulse to demand his passports, lest such action seem\r\nunnecessarily provocative, Livingston replied in a dignified note that\r\nunless de Rigny’s letter was intended as a dismissal, he would await\r\ninstructions from his own Government.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Whigs were planning to make political capital out of the\r\ncrisis. The “Intelligencer,” the organ of the Senate Whigs, had assumed\r\nan attitude which, as we have seen, had given much comfort to the French\r\nenemies of the treaty. “We trust,” it said, “that it will be universally\r\nunderstood, not only at home, but everywhere abroad, that the\r\nrecommendation of the President is his own act only, and is not likely\r\n... to receive the approbation of the Congress or the people of the\r\nUnited States.” And Blair, in the “Globe,” hotly replied that “if she\r\n[France] shall shed American blood in this controversy, and push her\r\ninjustice to actual war, the responsibility for all the destruction of\r\nhuman lives ... will justly rest upon the heads of the editors of the\r\n‘National Intelligencer.’”[827] The “National Gazette,” another\r\nOpposition paper, compromised with the thought that Jackson “did well to\r\npresent the subject to Congress ... though we would earnestly dissuade\r\nCongress from giving him a discretion so important as that of\r\nreprisals.” Which, interpreted by Blair, meant that the mercantile class\r\nand bankers were interested in French claims, and it would be well to\r\nenforce them, “but if the national rights and honor, implicated in a\r\nrefusal to execute the treaty, should be vindicated by President\r\nJackson, it would add renown to the man whom it was the editors’\r\nbusiness to traduce.”[828]\r\n\r\nThe first act of the Whigs was to pack the Foreign Relations Committee\r\nof the Senate with the President’s enemies, three of the five, Clay,\r\nMangum, and Sprague, being virulent foes. “There are certainly not three\r\nmen in the French Chamber,” wrote Blair, “more anxiously bent on\r\nthwarting the measures of General Jackson’s Administration.”[829] Into\r\nthe hands of these was delivered that portion of the Message dealing\r\nwith the French affair, and a month later Clay offered his resolution\r\nthat “it is inexpedient at this time” to grant authority to the\r\nPresident to make reprisals. In presenting his report, Clay made the\r\nstartling statement that if France was prudent “she will wait to see\r\nwhether the Message should be seconded by the Congress.” Thus, in the\r\nface of a prospective foreign foe, patently in the wrong, the leader of\r\nthe Whigs attempted to create the impression that Jackson stood alone.\r\nThis was the cue to the politicians. The Clay report was extravagantly\r\npraised. Poindexter, in ecstatic mood, moved that twenty thousand copies\r\nbe printed for circulation--as propaganda to isolate the President.\r\nCalhoun favored “the largest number.” The report had delighted him.\r\n“War was at all times to be avoided.”[830] Only two Whigs objected to\r\ntwenty thousand copies, and these on the ground that the printing of so\r\nmany would require four months.[831] Hill demanded the yeas and nays,\r\nand by a party vote the “largest number” of Clay’s campaign document was\r\nordered. Thus, from the beginning, the divisions in the Senate on an\r\ninternational crisis were along party lines.\r\n\r\nOn the day Livingston received the curt note from de Rigny, Clay, in\r\nopening the discussion of his resolution, threw out the suggestion twice\r\nthat France might make the appropriation conditional on an “explanation”\r\nfrom the President of the United States. He felt sure that France would\r\nunderstand that Congress did not share the President’s views. The\r\nDemocratic members of the committee, in a minority report, differed from\r\nthe majority in explaining the reason for finding it “inexpedient” to\r\ngrant authority--the fact that the Chamber had been called a month\r\nearlier than anticipated. The only vigorous attack on the majority\r\nreport, and the sole unapologetic American speech, was that of Buchanan,\r\nwho, better than any other member of the Senate, understood the\r\nconditions in Paris. He called for an unqualified assertion of our\r\ndetermination to demand the observance of the treaty. “I hope I may be\r\nmistaken,” he concluded, “but I believe it never will be paid\r\nbefore.”[832] The brief debate, heard by the fashion of the capital\r\npacked in the galleries, was conducted with decorum, but quite\r\ndiscernible beneath the surface one may read the party feeling which\r\neven an international crisis could not obliterate. The Clay resolution\r\nwas adopted. The “National Intelligencer,” now finding its way regularly\r\nto Paris, expressed the hope that “with this unquestionable proof of the\r\npacific temper of the Senate ... it will now be understood at home and\r\nabroad that there is no morbid appetite for war among the grave and\r\nconsiderate portion of the American people.”\r\n\r\nSeveral weeks were to intervene before the House took action. Meanwhile\r\nin Paris, Livingston, in seclusion, prepared his masterful and spirited\r\nformal reply to the impudent note of the French Minister. He loftily\r\nrebuked him for referring to the President as “General Jackson” in\r\nofficial language, firmly reiterated and proved the charge of broken\r\nfaith in the matter of the Serurier pledge, and pitilessly exposed the\r\nhypocrisy of the complaint that Jackson had misrepresented, purposely,\r\nregarding the time of the calling of the Chamber. Had not de Rigny\r\nhimself informed him that it was constitutionally impossible to call the\r\nsession earlier when protest had been made as to the date? And yet it\r\nhad been called. When a copy of this note reached Forsyth, he summoned\r\nVan Buren and the two repaired to the White House, where it was read and\r\nwarmly approved.[833] By this time Jackson was in no mood to compromise\r\nor conciliate. Forsyth instructed Livingston that, if the French Chamber\r\nagain rejected the appropriation bill, a frigate was to be immediately\r\nsent to convey him home. Ten days after these instructions were written,\r\nSerurier was recalled, and Forsyth, in refusing an audience, coolly\r\ninformed him that he was “ready to receive in writing any communication\r\nthe Minister of France desires to have made to the Government of the\r\nUnited States.”[834]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the French papers reaching the United States were noisily\r\nmilitant. War-clouds lowered. James A. Hamilton tendered his services to\r\nJackson for duty “civil or military, at home or abroad.”[835] Major\r\nLewis, gravely concerned because of his daughter’s marriage to M. Pageot\r\nof the French Legation, hastened to reassure Hamilton with extracts from\r\npersonal letters from governmental officials in Paris--and thus threw an\r\ninteresting side-light on the romance and tragedy of international\r\nmarriages, for these letters had been translated, for the benefit of\r\nJackson, in the French Legation by Madame Pageot, the wife of the First\r\nSecretary![836]\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nUnder these ominous conditions, with offers of military service pouring\r\ninto the White House, with the French Minister on the ocean _en route_\r\nto Paris, and with additional letters in the diplomatic duel before it,\r\nthe House of Representatives began its discussion of the crisis. With\r\nthe majority report and resolutions declaring against further\r\nnegotiations and in favor of contingent preparations, the House was\r\nimmediately engaged in an animated and acrimonious discussion indicative\r\nof the excitement of the times. Edward Everett, the pacifist of the\r\nsession, offered a substitute coupling a declaration of adherence to the\r\ntreaty with a request for the renewal of negotiations. Adams, in ugly\r\ntemper, threw out the hint that it appeared that “the supporters of the\r\nAdministration were the only ones to be heard upon the subject.” With\r\nsome feeling, Cambreleng, in charge for the Administration, assured the\r\nformer President that he was ready to enter upon a free accommodation of\r\ndifferences that a united front might be presented to the Nation’s\r\nadversary. This little storm cleared the atmosphere, and on the next day\r\nwhen the debate began in earnest it was wholesomely free from purely\r\npartisan rancor. Then it was that Adams explained his dissent from the\r\nphrasing. He objected to the assertion that negotiations should be\r\ndiscontinued. “The only alternative compatible with the honor of nations\r\nis war,” he said. If a continuance of the negotiations failed, he was\r\nready for the “hazard of war.” He realized that “the interest and honor\r\nof the Nation” were at stake. The pledge of France had been given, and\r\nthe sole question was “whether we shall suffer the nation that made\r\nthis treaty to violate it.” We could not afford to compromise to the\r\nextent of a penny.\r\n\r\n“What will be the consequences,” demanded the fiery old man eloquent,\r\n“if you give it up? Why, every nation will consider itself at liberty to\r\nsport with all treaties that are made with us.”\r\n\r\nAnd then Adams startled the Democrats, and broke with the Whigs, in his\r\nreference to Jackson. “Whatever may be said of the imprudence of that\r\nrecommendation,” he exclaimed, “the opinion of mankind will ever be that\r\nit was high-spirited and lofty, and such as became the individual from\r\nwhom it emanated. I say it now, and I repeat, that it is the attitude\r\nwhich the Chief Magistrate will bear before the world, and before\r\nmankind, and before posterity.”[837]\r\n\r\nQuite different the feeling of William S. Archer, a Virginia Whig, who\r\nlooked with fear and trembling to a contest with France. Think, he\r\ncried, of the commercial loss! Why sacrifice this with so little\r\ninvolved? “It would be quixotic, and even romance scarcely presented a\r\nprecedent, unless that of Sir Lucius O’Trigger.” And even if right, why\r\ntake the chance? He had been surprised that Adams had said nothing about\r\nfear.\r\n\r\n“No,” shouted Adams, “the gentleman’s whole argument is fear!”\r\n\r\nThe Virginian closed by offering a resolution “that in the just\r\nexpectation that the Government of France will have made provision ...\r\nthis House will forbear at the present time to adopt any measure in\r\nrelation to that subject.”[838]\r\n\r\nWith flaming indignation, James W. Bouldin, a Virginia Democrat, replied\r\nto Archer’s timorous speech. “The gentleman asks if we would really go\r\nto war for five million dollars,” he said. “Will a man fight if you spit\r\nin his face?” Already the French Chamber was boasting that we had taken\r\nthe like from others, and declaring that we were “a money-making,\r\nmoney-loving people, and would never spend a hundred million to obtain\r\nfive.” And, continued Bouldin, “I have heard as much praise of foreign\r\nnations as I want to hear.... All I want to hear at this time is whether\r\nwe intend to hold upon the treaty or give it up entirely.”[839]\r\n\r\nCambreleng, aroused by the sordid character of the Archer appeal,\r\nsharply warned that “the honor and welfare of the Nation is involved,\r\nand the measure will no longer be sacrificed to gratify the spirit of\r\nparty.”[840] To which Tristam Burges, a Rhode Island Whig, responded\r\nwith the amazing assertion that “France would be cowardly indeed if she\r\nshould pay the money under such circumstances.”[841]\r\n\r\nEdward Everett followed with a typical pacifist appeal for peace, but it\r\nwas reserved for the eloquent Horace Binney to present the most novel\r\nreasons for America’s consent to her humiliation. In the President’s\r\nMessage he had found “the President’s design ... impossible to\r\nfathom.”[842] The action of the French Chamber was none of our business.\r\nIn the meantime we should not close the door on negotiations. The French\r\nRepublicans were using the treaty as a club upon the monarchy, and\r\nshould this country “strengthen the hands of a constitutional\r\nmonarchy?”[843]\r\n\r\nThen Adams, in no conciliatory temper, rose again. “Whence come these\r\ncompliments to France?” he asked. “Are they elicited by her virtues? Is\r\nit because she has refused the payment ... due us? Is it because she has\r\nviolated her plighted faith? Is it from the style of the dignified\r\ndebates ... where we are characterized as a nation of mercenaries--where\r\nthe basest and meanest of motives are attributed to the American\r\npeople--those of sordid avarice, speculation, and gain?... Is it on this\r\nthat the gentleman from Virginia bases his ‘just expectations’?” And,\r\nturning to Everett: “We have heard much of war and its horrors. No man\r\ncan entertain a greater abhorrence of war than I. I would do anything\r\nbut sacrifice honor and independence to avoid it. But when I hear it\r\nadvanced that there is no such thing as national honor, that it is\r\nmerely ideal, I must take leave to say that I do not subscribe to such a\r\ndoctrine.”[844]\r\n\r\nBut the next speaker, Benjamin Hardin, though hailing from the fighting\r\nState of Kentucky, was not impressed. Randolph had compared his wit to\r\n“a coarse kitchen butcher knife whetted upon a brickbat,”[845] but he\r\nnow purred gently to the harsh strokes of the French Chamber. “What\r\nwould we go to war for?” he demanded. “The paltry sum of five million\r\ndollars!” In one year war would “sweep from the ocean at least fifty\r\nmillions of our commerce.” And where would the expense fall? “Upon the\r\nhard-working and industrious farmer.”[846]\r\n\r\nThe outcome was the adoption of a resolution which was a compromise\r\nbetween that of the committee and the ideas of Adams, insisting on the\r\nmaintenance of the treaty and in favor of preparations. This was adopted\r\nat a night session on the 2d of March, and the session was then thought\r\nto expire at midnight on March 3d.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nAn occurrence on the last day of the session, due to partisan madness,\r\nleft the Republic all but naked to its prospective foe. Early in the\r\nevening, during the consideration of the Fortifications Bill, an\r\namendment was offered in the House, appropriating three millions to be\r\nused at the discretion of the President for emergency work in the event\r\nFrance should strike during the congressional recess. It met with no\r\nopposition in the House, but the moment it reached the Senate it was\r\npounced upon by the Whig leaders as another proof of Jackson’s itch for\r\npower. Webster, assuming the leadership in the sorry business, proposed\r\ninstantly to dispose of the amendment with a motion to “adhere” to the\r\nSenate measure. This harsh, unusual course was intended as a notice that\r\nthe Senate would not even meet the House in conference upon the subject.\r\n\r\nThen followed a most amazing spectacle, with the Whigs assailing Jackson\r\nand his alleged contempt for the Constitution and determination to\r\ndeclare war without an Act of Congress. Senator Buchanan, protesting\r\nagainst the Webster motion, pointed out the necessity for the\r\nappropriation--the possibility of a blow from France during the recess,\r\nthe frankly expressed apprehension of Livingston. “In that event,” he\r\ncontinued, “what will be our condition? Our seacoast from Georgia to\r\nMaine will be exposed to the incursions of the enemy; our cities may be\r\nplundered and burnt; the national character may be disgraced; and all\r\nthis whilst we have an overflowing Treasury.”[847]\r\n\r\nKing of Alabama earnestly pleaded with Webster to withdraw the harsh\r\nmotion. “In what way,” he asked, “does it violate the Constitution? Does\r\nit give the President the power to declare war? This power belongs to\r\nCongress alone, nor does the bill in the slightest degree impair it.\r\nDoes it authorize the raising of armies? No, not one man may be enlisted\r\nbeyond the number required to fill up the ranks of your little army.”\r\n\r\nBut Webster was deaf to the appeal. The “autocrat” and “tyrant” was\r\nagain making an onslaught on the Constitution, and he would have none of\r\nit. And by a strict party vote, for White of Tennessee had by now\r\ndefinitely joined the Opposition, the motion to adhere was adopted.\r\n\r\nWhen this surprising action reached the House, it swallowed its pride\r\nand asked for a conference. The conferees met and remained in deadlock\r\nuntil midnight. Forsyth and Van Buren were at the Capitol trying without\r\navail to get action. Meanwhile in the Senate something very like a\r\nfilibuster was begun. Benton was impressed by the number of the\r\nspeakers, their vehemence, perseverance, provocative attacks on Jackson,\r\nand indirectly on the House.[848]\r\n\r\nAll this time, Jackson was patiently waiting in his room at the Capitol\r\nto sign the bill when passed. At midnight he put on his hat and returned\r\nto the White House. The conference and debate continued, with many, who\r\nconsidered the session dead at midnight,[849] leaving the Capitol, until\r\nrepeated calls of the House failed to secure a quorum. At a late hour\r\nsome of the Whig members of the House were insisting that the amendment\r\nbe abandoned, with the Democrats refusing to yield and placing the\r\nresponsibility upon the Senate. Partisan bitterness became more\r\npronounced as the end approached. “There are men who would willingly see\r\nthe banner of France waving over your Capitol, rather than lose an\r\nopportunity to make a thrust at the Administration,” bitterly exclaimed\r\nJesse Bynum of North Carolina. “This is not a miserable Administration\r\nor anti-Administration question,” protested Henry A. Wise, the Whig who\r\nfavored the amendment. The danger of war was real and if it came “every\r\nfortification on your coast is liable to fall into the hands of a strong\r\nmaritime power,” he warned.[850] At intervals, motions to recede were\r\noffered and overwhelmingly defeated.\r\n\r\nIt was two o’clock in the morning when Cambreleng returned to the House\r\nwith a compromise--$300,000 for arming the fortifications, $500,000 for\r\nrepairs and the equipping of war vessels, “an amount wholly inadequate\r\nif it should be required, and more than necessary if it should not.” As\r\nhe entered the House, he found no quorum, and no possibility of getting\r\none. On a motion to adjourn, only 111 members were present and voting; a\r\nfew moments later but 75; and at three o’clock, Speaker Bell rose,\r\ndelivered a brief valedictory, and the House stood adjourned without\r\nday. The Nation was naked to the foe, and in the midst of negotiations.\r\n\r\nFar from weakening Jackson’s determination to maintain the dignity and\r\nrights of the Nation, the failure of the Fortifications Bill but\r\nstrengthened his will, and two days after Congress adjourned, Forsyth\r\ninstructed Livingston to demand an explanation or qualification of an\r\ninsinuation in Serurier’s note of withdrawal that the President had\r\nknowingly misrepresented in his Message to Congress.[851]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in France, the Whigs’ campaign to picture Jackson as isolated\r\nin his position from both Congress and the people was having its effect,\r\nand there were Whigs in America who rejoiced in the fact. Scanning the\r\nFrench newspapers, Philip Hone was delighted to find that Clay’s report\r\nand the Senate resolution had had the effect he anticipated. He rejoiced\r\nto find that they convinced the French that the proposal of reprisals\r\n“are only the acts of the President” and “would not be sanctioned by the\r\nlegislature of the Nation.”[852]\r\n\r\nAnd Hone was not mistaken as to the effect of Jackson’s firmness and the\r\nSenate’s action. The money was appropriated by the Chamber with the\r\npayment contingent on an apology or explanation from Jackson. In the\r\ndiscussion of the appropriation measure, Jackson was roundly denounced,\r\nand ridiculed as one repudiated by his own people. Boasts were made of\r\nthe ease with which France could crush the United States. “The insult\r\nfrom President Jackson comes from himself alone,” said M. Henri de\r\nChabaulon. “This is more evident from the refusal of the American\r\nCongress to concur with him in it.... Suppose the United States had\r\ntaken part with General Jackson, we should have had to demand\r\nsatisfaction, not from him, but from the United States; ... and we\r\nshould have had to ... entrust to our heroes of Navarino and Algiers the\r\ntask of teaching the Americans that France knows the way to Washington\r\nas well as England.” And this insulting speech was received with\r\napplause. “When the Americans see this long sword,” exclaimed M. Ranee,\r\n“believe me, gentlemen, they would sooner touch your money than dare to\r\ntouch your sword.”[853] Left to his own resources by the absence of\r\ninstructions on the proviso of the measure of the Chamber, Livingston\r\ninformed the Due de Broglie that an attempt to enforce the proviso would\r\nbe repelled “by the undivided energy of the Nation.”[854] And four days\r\nlater he left Paris, with Barton, his son-in-law, at the American\r\nLegation as Chargé d’Affaires.\r\n\r\nFrom this time on to the crisis, the American Legation in Paris and the\r\nFrench in Washington were under Chargés d’Affaires, and strangely enough\r\nthe wives of both were prime favorites of Jackson and intimates of the\r\nWhite House circle. The beautiful and exquisite Cora Livingston,\r\ndaughter of the Minister, was long the reigning belle of the American\r\ncapital. Josiah Quincy had been infatuated with her, and the story has\r\ncome down of Van Buren trying to get her under the mistletoe. In the\r\nWhite House she had come and gone with the informality of a member of\r\nthe household, and many an evening she had spent with Mrs. Donelson in\r\none of the private rooms of the President’s house, with Jackson sitting\r\nat one side smoking his pipe. She had married Barton a short time before\r\nLivingston’s departure for Paris, and it had pleased the man of iron,\r\nwith so much of tender sentiment where women were concerned, to appoint\r\nthe bridegroom Secretary of the Legation that Cora might be in Paris\r\nwith her mother. Enclosing his commission in a letter to “My Dear\r\nCora,” he had asked her to “present it to him with your own hand.”\r\n\r\nQuite as closely connected with the White House circle was Madame\r\nPageot, known to Jackson as little Delia Lewis, daughter of one of the\r\nmembers of the Kitchen Cabinet. He had known her as a child in Tennessee\r\nwhere her father dwelt close to the Hermitage, and she had known and\r\nloved the sainted Rachel. When her engagement to Pageot was announced,\r\nJackson had insisted that the marriage should take place in the White\r\nHouse, and when her first child was born and called “Andrew Jackson,”\r\nthe christening had been in the President’s house. It was on this\r\noccasion when the Minister, following the form, asked the infant,\r\n“Andrew Jackson, do you renounce the Devil and all his works?” that the\r\nPresident with great fervor responded, “I do most indubitably,” to the\r\ndelight of all.\r\n\r\nThus there was a touch to the closing days of the crisis that probably\r\nhas no parallel in the history of diplomacy.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nHad the French politicians been able to witness the popular ovation\r\naccorded Livingston on his arrival in New York, they might have changed\r\ntheir opinion concerning Jackson’s isolation from the people. An immense\r\ncrowd greeted him at the wharf, followed him to his lodgings, clamored\r\nfor a speech, and thronged the City Hall at the public reception. Philip\r\nHone, one of the Whigs who rejoiced in the demand of a foreign nation\r\nfor an apology from the American President, was gravely concerned\r\nbecause he had returned in “a bad humor,” and might “infuse some of it\r\ninto the mind of the obstinate and weak old man at the head of the\r\nGovernment, and so prevent an amicable arrangement.”[855] But the Whig\r\ndiarist’s greatest disgust came with Livingston’s ovation at the dinner\r\nof the Corporation on July 4th, when at the conclusion of his brief\r\nspeech the room rang with cries of “No explanations!” “No\r\napology!”--dividing, as Hone records, “the echoes of the spacious dome\r\nwith equally inspiring shouts of ‘Hurrah for Jackson!’”[856] At\r\nPhiladelphia, _en route_ to Washington, Livingston was the guest of\r\nhonor at an equally enthusiastic dinner, and, thus acclaimed by his\r\ncountrymen, he reached Washington and went into conference with Jackson,\r\nForsyth, and Van Buren.\r\n\r\nCalm and determined, Jackson waited patiently until in September when he\r\nproposed to press the issue to a decision. Forsyth sent instructions to\r\nBarton. If nothing indicative of a purpose to pay the indemnity had been\r\ndone, the Chargé was to call upon the Due de Broglie and ask for a\r\ndefinite answer with the view to the regulation of his conduct. If the\r\nMinister should fix a day for the payment, Barton was to remain in\r\nParis; otherwise he was to demand his passports because of the\r\nnon-execution of the treaty. And this step was to be taken in time to\r\npermit the result to be communicated to Jackson before he prepared his\r\nMessage for the opening of Congress. In the latter part of October,\r\nBarton had his audience with de Broglie, and handled himself with\r\nconsummate tact and caution. With studied impudence the French Minister\r\nannounced that the money would be forthcoming when an explanation or\r\napology had been received, and a few days later, Barton sailed for the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Congress convened, and Jackson in his Message reported\r\nprogress, soberly reviewing the course of the negotiations up to the\r\npassage of the indemnity bill by the French Chamber with its offensive\r\nproviso, and bluntly concluding that the French Government has “received\r\nall the explanation which honor and principle permitted.” He informed\r\nCongress of his final instructions to Barton and of his purpose to\r\ncommunicate the result when ascertained.\r\n\r\nIt was while awaiting the report of the American Chargé d’Affaires that\r\nM. Pageot received notice of his recall, and by the time he was able to\r\nsail the two nations were on the verge of war. Hone, noting the\r\ndeparture of the Poland bearing M. Pageot and “the odds and ends of the\r\nFrench Legation,” could not restrain his mirth over the prospective\r\ndiscomfiture of the French Chargé in bearing back to the French Court a\r\nyoung heir, bearing “the august name of Andrew Jackson.”[857]\r\n\r\nWhen Barton reached New York, he hastened with all speed to Washington,\r\nwhere Livingston awaited him. It was with no little anxiety that Van\r\nBuren, Forsyth, and Livingston accompanied him to the White House. The\r\nthree older men, all devoted to Jackson, and all at some time at the\r\nhead of his Department of Foreign Affairs, were greatly concerned over\r\nthe possible effect of the report on the thoroughly aroused President.\r\n\r\nObserving their solemnity, Barton turned upon them:\r\n\r\n“Well, gentlemen, shall it be oil or water?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, water, by all means,” they answered in a chorus.\r\n\r\nTo none of these, not even to Livingston, had Barton indicated the\r\nnature of the report he had to make. Pressing the former Minister’s hand\r\nas a token of appreciation of his confidence, Barton led the way into\r\nthe iron man’s presence.\r\n\r\nThe moment the conference was over, Jackson began the preparation of his\r\nMessage to Congress, and, on its completion, submitted it to Livingston.\r\nIn view of Hone’s fear, it is interesting to note that it was the former\r\nMinister of State who persuaded Jackson to a moderation of its tone.\r\nDrawing a substitute, he sent it to the White House with an ingratiating\r\nletter.\r\n\r\n“The characteristics of the present communication,” he wrote, “ought, in\r\nmy opinion, to be moderation and firmness. Our cause is so good that we\r\nneed not be violent. Moderation in language, firmness in purpose, will\r\nunite all hearts at home, all opinion abroad, in our favor. Warmth and\r\nrecrimination will give arguments to false friends and real enemies,\r\nwhich they may use with effect against us. On these principles I have\r\nframed a hasty draft which I enclose. You will, with your usual\r\ndiscernment, determine whether it suits the present emergency. At any\r\nrate, I know you will do justice to the motive that has induced me to\r\noffer it.”[858]\r\n\r\nJackson took the advice in good part, destroyed his declaration of war,\r\nand prepared, with the assistance of Forsyth, another, which was\r\nsubmitted to Congress on January 15th. It was an excited body of men\r\nthat listened that winter day to the reading of the Message that might\r\nmean war. But three days before, an acrimonious debate had been\r\nprecipitated by Benton, charging the partisanship of the Senate with\r\nresponsibility for the failure of the Fortifications Bill; and only the\r\nday before, Webster, in a spirited reply, had attempted to shift\r\nresponsibility to the Democratic House. John Quincy Adams, enraged at\r\nWebster’s reflections upon the House, was meditating his sensational\r\nreply. In this atmosphere the Message was read.\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing the controversy up to the hour of the Message, with the\r\ndeclaration that “the spirit of the American people, the dignity of the\r\nLegislature, and the firm resolve of their Executive Government forbid”\r\nan apology or explanation, he called upon Congress to “sustain Executive\r\nexertion in such measures as the case requires.” This included,\r\naccording to his idea, reprisals, the exclusion of French products and\r\nFrench vessels from American ports. But there was more to be done. Naval\r\npreparations of the French intended for our seas had been announced. He\r\nknew not the purpose. But, “come what may, the explanation which France\r\ndemands can never be accorded, and no armament, however powerful and\r\nimposing, at a distance or on our coast, will, I trust, deter us from\r\ndischarging the high duties we owe to our constituents, our national\r\ncharacter, and to the world”; and he called upon the Congress “to\r\nvindicate the faith of treaties and to promote the general interest of\r\npeace, civilization, and improvement.”[859]\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the seriousness of the crisis the memory of the failure\r\nof the Fortifications Bill in the last session would not down.\r\nThroughout the spring, summer, and autumn of 1835, the press and\r\npoliticians were engaged in bitter criminations and recriminations as to\r\nthe responsibility. It was manifestly the fault of the Senate Whigs, but\r\ntheir harassed leaders bitterly retaliated on the Democratic House, and\r\ndrew upon their imagination in an effort to place responsibility upon\r\nthe Jacksonian leaders. A fantastical article, once attributed to Daniel\r\nWebster, appeared in the “National Gazette,” charging that Van Buren and\r\nJohn Forsyth had expressed the wish to Cambreleng, the Democratic leader\r\nin the House, that the bill should fail, that the calamity might be\r\nascribed to the Whigs of the Senate. The people had been thoroughly\r\noutraged at the base prostitution of the Nation’s interest to the\r\npettiness of party politics. During the summer, Blair called attention\r\nin the “Globe” to Serurier’s action in sending to Paris with Jackson’s\r\nMessage the criticism of the “National Intelligencer,” with the comment\r\nthat the French Minister for Foreign Affairs would do well to read the\r\ntwo together! Paris was assured by Serurier that the Whig paper had\r\n“pretty considerable influence,” had “under the presidencies of Madison\r\nand Monroe been the official paper,” and “has spoken energetically\r\nagainst the measure” the President had proposed. The President’s sharp\r\nreference to the unfortunate situation created by the failure of the\r\nbill, in his Message of December, 1835, had shown a determination, on\r\nthe part of that consummate politician, to turn the popular indignation\r\nupon the Opposition. However, with the passion of the parties\r\nsmouldering beneath the surface, there was no open fight until, on\r\nJanuary 12th, the pugnacious Benton, speaking on the national defense,\r\nreviewed the failure of the Fortifications Bill, and laid the\r\nresponsibility at the Senate’s door. He closed his biting comments with\r\nan effective reference to the approach of the French squadron, sent on\r\nthe supposition of our helplessness, and the suggestion that the Senate\r\nshould then act “under the guns of France and under the eyes of\r\nEurope.”[860]\r\n\r\nThat was the call to battle. The irate Webster sprang to his feet to\r\nannounce that a little later he would be able to exonerate the Senate,\r\nand the fiery Leigh of Virginia protested that “the objection to the\r\nappropriation was not because of any distrust of the President,” but\r\nbecause of the unconstitutionality of the amendment: this in delicious\r\ndisregard of the plain record of the debate. But Preston, who followed,\r\nexposed the cloven hoof of the partisan animus. If the French fleet was\r\ncoming, why had the President kept Congress in the dark? Why had he\r\nwithdrawn our representatives from Paris? Why had we no representative\r\nat the Court of England?--an audacious question in view of the refusal\r\nby the Whig Senate to confirm either of two excellent appointments to\r\nthat post. Why assume that the French fleet came with hostile motives?\r\n“It may be that this fleet is coming to protect the commerce of France,”\r\nhe thought. From this it was an easy step to the reiteration of the Whig\r\napologies for and defense of the action of the French Government.[861]\r\n\r\nBut the last word in defense of the Senate was reserved for Webster, who\r\nrose twenty-four hours before the Special Message reached the Senate and\r\nwhile it was being prepared. It was a laboriously wrought attempt. The\r\namendment to the Fortifications Bill had been offered at the eleventh\r\nhour. The President had not requested the additional appropriation in a\r\nMessage. No department had recommended it. Nothing of which Congress was\r\ncognizant had occurred to justify it. The Senate had passed a resolution\r\n“reminding” the House of the bill in the closing hours. The conference\r\nreport had not been passed upon by the House. And “the bill therefore\r\nwas lost. It was lost in the House of Representatives. It died there,\r\nand there its remains are to be found.” Had not the President announced\r\nat one o’clock that he would receive no further communications from the\r\nCongress? What right had he to interfere with the time Congress should\r\nfix for adjournment?[862] And what constitutional right had Congress to\r\nmake an appropriation when there was no specification of the precise use\r\nto be made of the money? And with true Websterian eloquence he closed\r\nwith mournful meditations on the encroachments of Jackson upon the\r\nConstitution, and the prediction that, unless checked, men, then living,\r\nwould “write the history of this government, from its commencement to\r\nits close.”[863]\r\n\r\nThat the Jacksonians were not impressed with the danger was shown in the\r\nbrief reply of Cuthbert of Georgia, that the great danger to Rome was\r\nnot in the kingly name they feared, but “in the patrician class, a\r\nmoneyed aristocracy, a combination of their political leaders, seeking\r\nto establish an aristocratical government, regardless of the welfare of\r\nthe people.” But the answer to Webster was not to come from a Democrat,\r\nbut from a Whig--and that, too, a Whig from Massachusetts, who had been\r\ndefeated for reëlection to the Presidency by Andrew Jackson!\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nThere had long been an undercurrent of hostility between Daniel Webster\r\nand John Quincy Adams. Webster had gladly left the House during the\r\nAdams Administration to escape the necessity of defending the President;\r\nand the comments on the great orator, running through the famous “Diary”\r\nof Adams, are often sarcastic, usually unfriendly, and seldom fulsome.\r\nThat this spirit of animus alone should have impelled Adams to make his\r\nnotable reply--a reply which has been strangely ignored by\r\nhistorians--cannot be reconciled with his character as a public man. The\r\nfact that Webster had assailed the House of which Adams was a leading\r\nmember, and the amendment with which Adams had had something to do, may\r\nexplain the bitterness of his retort. But no one can read the speeches\r\nof Adams on the French controversy without being impressed with the\r\nrobust Americanism of the man, and his utter impatience with a partisan\r\nthought in the presence of a foreign adversary.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity for Adams’s reply came one week after the Webster\r\nspeech, six days after the President’s Special Message, and when the\r\ninternational crisis seemed most menacing. The “National Intelligencer”\r\nhad made an attack upon the House of Representatives, along the line of\r\nthe Webster speech, and Cambreleng, who had been personally assailed, in\r\nresenting the article had said that “more than one member of the House,\r\nnot only on this side, but on both sides, will vindicate the proceedings\r\nof the House in relation to the bill.” Immediately afterwards Adams\r\npresented his resolution for an investigation, and launched into one of\r\nthe most bitter, dramatic, and sensational speeches ever heard in the\r\nAmerican Congress. He rose in fighting armor. Scarcely had he begun his\r\nattack upon the Senate when he was called to order for mentioning that\r\nbody; whereupon he jauntily observed that he would “transfer the\r\nlocation of the place where these things had happened from the Senate\r\nto the office of the ‘National Intelligencer’”--and thus proceeded to\r\nthe castigation of that journal. In explaining the reasons for the\r\nthree-million-dollar amendment, he recounted the story of the resolution\r\nadopted in the House.\r\n\r\n“In all the debates in the ‘National Intelligencer,’” he said, “there is\r\nno more trace of such a resolution having passed the House than if it\r\nhad never existed; no more trace than can be found on the journal of the\r\nSenate of what they would do for the defense of the country, or to\r\ninsist on the execution of the treaty of July. But in the debate in the\r\n‘National Intelligencer,’ I find a prodigious display of eloquence\r\nagainst the constitutionality of the section appropriating $3,000,000\r\nfor the defense of the country, because it had not been recommended by\r\nthe Executive.”\r\n\r\nThe House was instantly in an uproar, and Adams was again called to\r\norder for his reference to the Senate. The old man stood listening\r\ncalmly to the excited observations of some of his colleagues, and was\r\nfinally permitted to proceed.\r\n\r\n“Observe, sir,” he continued, “the terms, the object, and the conditions\r\nof that appropriation. It was to be expended, in whole or in part, under\r\nthe direction of the President of the United States--the executive head\r\nof the Nation, sworn to the faithful execution of the laws; sworn\r\nespecially, and entrusted with the superintendence of all the defenses\r\nof the country against the ravages of a foreign invader; it was to be\r\nexpended for the military and naval service, including fortifications\r\nand ordnance and increase of the navy. These, sir, the natural and\r\nappropriate instruments of defense against a foreign foe, were the sole\r\nand exclusive objects of the appropriation. Not one dollar of it could\r\nhave been applied by him to any other purposes without making himself\r\nliable to impeachment; not by that House of Representatives, but by us,\r\ntheir successors, fresh from the constituent body, the people; yet\r\nbefore the same Senate for his judges, a majority of whom were surely\r\nnot of his friends; not one dollar of it could have been expended\r\nwithout giving a public account of it to the representatives of the\r\npeople and to the Nation. Nor was this all. Thus confined to specific\r\nobjects, it was to be expended, not unconditionally, but only in the\r\nevent that it should be rendered necessary for the defense of the\r\ncountry prior to the then next session of Congress--an interval of nine\r\nmonths--during which no other provision could have been made to defend\r\nyour soil from sudden invasion, or to protect your commerce floating\r\nupon every sea from a sweep of a royal ordinance of France.\r\n\r\n“And this is the appropriation, following close upon that unanimous vote\r\nof 217 members of the House, that the execution of the Treaty of 1831\r\nshould be maintained and insisted upon. This is the appropriation so\r\ntainted with man-worship, so corrupt, so unconstitutional, that the\r\nindignant and patriotic eloquence of the ‘National Intelligencer’ would\r\nsooner see a foreign foe battering down the walls of the Capitol than\r\nagree to it.”\r\n\r\nIf this reference to the declaration of Webster caused the members of\r\nthe House to catch their breath, the next sentence brought the Democrats\r\nto their feet with prolonged cheers and shouts.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” Adams continued, “for a man uttering such sentiments there would\r\nbe but one step more, a natural and an easy one to take, and that would\r\nbe, with the enemy at the walls of the Capitol, to join him in battering\r\nthem down.”\r\n\r\nWith the Whigs dazed, and the Democrats shouting their approval, James\r\nK. Polk, in the chair, was forced to hammer vigorously with his gavel\r\nbefore he could restore any semblance of order--and the old man lunged\r\nagain at Webster’s argument.\r\n\r\n“Are we to be told,” he asked, “that this and the other House must not\r\nappropriate money unless by recommendation from the Executive? Why, sir,\r\nthe Executive has told us now that that appropriation was perfectly in\r\naccord with his wishes. Yet here the charge is inverted, and\r\nunconstitutional conspiracy and man-worship are imputed to this House on\r\naccount of that appropriation because it was approved and desired by the\r\nExecutive. Where was the possibility of a recommendation from the\r\nExecutive; of statements from the departments; of messages between this\r\nand the other House, when the resolution of the House had been passed\r\nbut the day before?...”\r\n\r\nAnd man-worship? Here Adams refused to follow his fellow Whigs in\r\nwithholding commendation from the patriotism of the President.\r\n\r\n“I will appeal to the House to say whether I am a worshiper of\r\nthe Executive.... Neither the measure of issuing letters of\r\nmarque and reprisal, nor the measures of commercial interdict or\r\nrestriction--neither had that House approved; but the House, and, thank\r\nGod, the people of the country, have done homage to the spirit which\r\nhad urged to the recommendation, even of those measures which they\r\ndid not approve. Why must the House be charged with man-worship and\r\nunconstitutional conspiracy, because they passed an appropriation of\r\nthree millions for the defense of the country, at a time when imminent\r\ndanger of war was urged, as resulting from that very resolution, which,\r\nbut the night before, passed by a unanimous vote? Because, forsooth,\r\nthat appropriation had not been asked for by the Executive; and yet\r\nbecause it was approved by the Executive.”\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the action of both Senate and House on the President’s\r\nrecommendation, Adams scornfully and contemptuously dismissed the Clay\r\nresolution in a few words: “A resolution not only declining to do that\r\nwhich the President had recommended to vindicate the rights and honor of\r\nthe Nation, but positively determining to do nothing--not even to\r\nexpress a sense of the wrongs which the country was enduring from\r\nFrance.”\r\n\r\n“And now, sir,” he continued, “where is all this scaffolding of\r\nindignation and horror at the appropriation for specific purposes, for\r\nthe defense of the country, because, forsooth, it had not been\r\nrecommended by the Special Message of the Executive? Gone, sir, gone!\r\nYou shall look for it and you shall not find it. You shall find no more\r\ntrace of it than, in the tales of the ‘National Intelligencer,’ you\r\nshall find of that vote of 217 yeas--which was the real voucher for the\r\npurity and patriotism of that appropriation of $3,000,000--denounced to\r\nthe world by the eloquent orators of the senatorial press as so\r\nprofligate and corrupt, that an enemy at the gates of this Capitol could\r\nnot have justified a vote in its favor to arrest his arm, and stay his\r\nhand in battering down these walls. You shall find no more trace of it\r\nupon the journals of the Senate than you shall find of sensibility to\r\nthe wrongs which our country was enduring from France.”\r\n\r\nThe old man eloquent thence passed to the complaint that the Senate was\r\nignorant of the reasons impelling the House to the adoption of the\r\namendment, and tore it to shreds; and then on to the responsibility for\r\nthe failure of the bill. This, he contended, was due to the very spirit\r\nof the Senate--its temper an insult to the President and the House. The\r\nWebster motion to adhere, he said, was always considered a “challenge,”\r\nand had never before been made at such an early stage of a difference\r\nbetween the Houses. “It was a special disposition,” he said, “to cast\r\nodium on the House, a special bravado that induced the Senate thus to\r\ndraw the sword, and throw away the scabbard--and they adhered.”\r\n\r\nTurning then to the willingness of the Senate, when it was too late, to\r\naccept an amendment for $800,000 instead of $3,000,000, he continued:\r\n\r\n“Thus, sir, this horrible conspiracy against the Constitution melted\r\ndown to a mere question of dollars and cents.” And when this agreement\r\nwas reached by the Senate, the House was dead--the hour of midnight\r\nhaving passed. He did not himself believe that a Congress died at\r\nmidnight, but others did, and they were conscientious. And the Senate,\r\nknowing of that situation, had the insolence to adopt its resolution of\r\nreminder and send it to the House. “But to complete the true character\r\nof that message we must inquire at what time it was sent. It was sent at\r\ntwo o’clock in the morning; it was sent at a time when it was known,\r\nboth in the House and the Senate, that no quorum was to be found. When\r\nthat message was delivered, I must confess, if ever a feeling of shame\r\nand indignation had filled my bosom, it was at that moment. I felt it\r\nwas an insult to the immediate representatives of the people; and if it\r\nhad been sent at a moment when the House existed, with the power to\r\nresent unprovoked insult, I verily believe, that, imitating the example\r\nof our Congress in a somewhat similar case during the Revolutionary War,\r\nI should have moved that a message be sent by two members of the House\r\nto cast the Senate message on their floor, and tell them it was not the\r\ncustom of the House to receive insolent messages.”[864]\r\n\r\nThus did Adams the Whig stand forth as the special champion of the\r\nPresident and the Democratic House, and tear the Webster sophistry to\r\ntatters; thus did he serve notice that, outside the more selfish\r\npoliticians of the Whig Opposition, the Nation applauded the spirit of\r\nJackson and was prepared to follow him against any foreign foe. The\r\nspeech was the sensation of the day, and Adams was never forgiven. Henry\r\nA. Wise, the brilliant Virginia Whig, followed in a remarkable medley of\r\ngossipy charges against his colleagues, but his effort was so novel in\r\nits irregularities that it destroyed itself--and the fight over the loss\r\nof the Fortifications Bill is told in the speeches of Webster and Adams.\r\nThe Whigs pursued the latter with their resentment to the polls in the\r\nautumn of that year, and he was able to record, after the election,\r\nthat he was “reëlected to the next Congress without formal opposition,\r\nbut almost without Whig votes.” And looking back at the end of the year,\r\nand recording his impressions, he referred to his reply to Webster with\r\nevident relish. “It demolished the speech of Webster,” he wrote, “drove\r\nhim from the field, and whipped him and his party into the rank and file\r\nof the Nation in the quarrel with the French King.”[865] It did\r\nsomething more; it disclosed the fact that the Whig leaders, in their\r\nhate of Jackson, approached perilously near disloyalty to their country.\r\nIf Jackson won his fight, it was after battling against, not only the\r\nGovernment of France, but against the party Opposition at home. And\r\nfighting this double battle, he won.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nAdams spoke on January 21, 1836, while Congress was considering the\r\nrecommendations of the Special Message. Alphonse Pageot, and his wife\r\nand son, Andrew Jackson, were in New York awaiting passage back to\r\nFrance; and two days after the French Chargé left New York, Charles\r\nBankhead, the British Chargé d’Affaires at Washington, acting on\r\ninstructions from his Government, offered the mediation of England in\r\nthe settlement of the Franco-American dispute, in a letter to Forsyth.\r\nJackson and his Secretary of State took six days to deliberate on the\r\nproposal before giving a formal answer. The note, signed, and no doubt\r\nprepared by Forsyth, is a strong and polished review of the controversy,\r\na reiteration of Livingston’s contention that no nation has the right to\r\nattempt an interference with the “consultation” of the departments of\r\nthe American Government, and an explicit reservation that the American\r\nGovernment would not make the explanation or apology prescribed by the\r\nGovernment of France. There is no single sign of weakening, absolutely\r\nnothing new in the way of a concession, and only a repetition of the\r\nLivingston notes to the Duc de Broglie.\r\n\r\nTwelve days later, Bankhead informed Forsyth of the success of the\r\nmediation. “The French Government,” he wrote, “has stated ... that the\r\nfrank and honorable manner in which the President has, in his recent\r\nMessage, expressed himself in regard to the points of difference between\r\nthe Governments of France and the United States, has removed those\r\ndifficulties, upon the score of national honor, which have hitherto\r\nstood in the way of the prompt execution by France of the treaty.”[866]\r\nThis was a complete reversal. The President had “expressed himself on\r\nthe points of difference” through Livingston, in conversation, and\r\nthrough notes to both de Rigny and de Broglie, and he had expressed\r\nhimself to them precisely as in “his recent Message.” And it was after\r\nhe had thus expressed himself that France had insisted that an\r\nexplanation or apology prescribed by her should be made as a condition\r\nto the execution of the treaty. Jackson added nothing; France accepted\r\nwhat she had scornfully refused before, and the triumph of Jackson was\r\ncomplete. On May 10th Jackson was able to inform Congress that France\r\nhad paid the four installments due. Thus, after the failures of the\r\nAdministrations of Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, and Adams to get a\r\nsettlement with France, Jackson had negotiated a treaty within two years\r\nof his first inauguration, and had enforced the observance of the treaty\r\nalmost a year before the expiration of his last term.\r\n\r\nThe theory of some historians that Jackson, in his dealings with foreign\r\nnations, was lacking in finesse and success, is manifestly colored by\r\nblind prejudice. The prestige of the Nation abroad was never so high as\r\nafter his stern insistence that a treaty with the United States could no\r\nmore be disregarded than one with any of the European Powers. John Fiske\r\ntouched the real significance of the result of the controversy when he\r\nwrote that “the days when foreign powers could safely insult us were\r\nevidently gone by.”[867] And the same historian discloses the necessity\r\nfor the position assumed by Jackson. “In foreign affairs,” he writes,\r\n“Jackson’s Administration won great credit through its enforcement of\r\nthe French spoliation claims. European nations which had claims for\r\ndamages against France on account of spoliations committed by French\r\ncruisers during the Napoleonic wars, had no difficulty after the Peace\r\nof 1815 in obtaining payment; but the claims of the United States had\r\nbeen superciliously neglected.”[868] And so pronounced a partisan as\r\nJohn W. Foster, Secretary of State under the second Harrison, has\r\nrecorded the deliberate judgment that “in its foreign relations his\r\nAdministration maintained a dignified and creditable attitude.”[869]\r\n\r\nThe Whig leaders in the Senate and the press, the Clays and Websters and\r\nthe Gales, had permitted their bitterness against Jackson to lead them\r\nto the verge of disloyalty to country, and the indignant protest of\r\nAdams was a true reflection of the popular opinion. The clever\r\npoliticians of the Kitchen Cabinet were not slow to see the opportunity\r\nagain to picture Jackson as the patriotic hero, for the second time\r\nleading his people in a fight against a foreign adversary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE OF THE SUCCESSION\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nFrom the adjournment of Congress in March, 1835, until it convened in\r\nDecember, the political leaders concerned themselves with presidential\r\npolitics, and the struggle for position was desperate and unscrupulous.\r\nFrom the hour in the first year of his first Administration, when\r\nJackson, fearful of an early death, wrote his celebrated letter to Judge\r\nOverton expressing a preference for Van Buren, the latter had been\r\nlooked upon as the crown prince. From that hour the master political\r\nmanipulators surrounding Jackson made no move not intended to advance\r\nthe “magician” toward the goal of his ambition. In the summer of 1833\r\nMajor Lewis was disturbed over the prospective candidacy of Justice\r\nMcLean,[870] but it failed to materialize, and, within a year after the\r\nMajor’s trepidation, the White House circle realized that the most\r\nserious challenge to the plans for the succession would come from Hugh\r\nLawson White of Tennessee, considered a renegade from the Jackson camp.\r\nThe close attachment of the President and the Senator from his State had\r\nperceptibly cooled in less than a year after the inauguration. The\r\nlatter was of a proud and sensitive temperament, and the growing\r\nintimacy of his old friend with the new school of practical politicians\r\nwas enough to estrange him. Had he hoped in the beginning to become the\r\nlegatee of Jackson, we should have a plausible explanation of his bitter\r\nresentment of the President’s failure to observe his one-term pledge. We\r\nonly know that he drifted, first into the position of an independent\r\nsupporter of the Administration, and later into one of frank hostility.\r\nHis imagination began early to play pranks with his judgment. He began\r\nto seek evidence of slights. In all the new school of Jacksonian leaders\r\nhe saw enemies. He carefully scrutinized the “Globe” for discriminations\r\nagainst him. That there was no conscious effort on the part of the paper\r\nto ignore him is shown in the action of Blair, on learning that the\r\nSenator was offended. In a cordial letter he assured the suspicious\r\nSenator that he felt “the most perfect consciousness” that he had “done\r\nnothing to offend--certainly not intentionally,” and begged him to\r\n“frankly state the offense that it may be righted.” The curt, ungracious\r\nreply of White was overlooked and an appeal made for a personal\r\ninterview, but the response was so repellent that further attempts at a\r\nreconciliation were abandoned. There is some justification for the\r\nconclusion that White had early determined upon a quarrel with the view\r\nto placing himself at the head of the opposition wing of the Democratic\r\nParty. In 1833 the Opposition began to claim him as its own when he\r\nsupported Calhoun’s bill on Executive patronage in a powerful speech,\r\nand joined Clay in opposing the Administration plan in the Nullification\r\nfight.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that under these conditions the small faction of\r\nthe Democratic Party should have turned to him as the logical man to pit\r\nagainst the pretensions of Van Buren. The former was a Southerner, the\r\nlatter a Northerner, and the slavery controversy had become acute. The\r\nfact that White was a Tennesseean was expected to embarrass and handicap\r\nJackson in his support of the New Yorker. To the Whigs he not only\r\npresented the best prospect for a schism in the party in power, but for\r\na time the leaders actually considered the wisdom of making him their\r\nown candidate. Clay was fearful that his candidacy would fail to infuse\r\namong the Whigs “the spirit and zeal necessary to insure success,” but\r\nthought he might, as an independent candidate, “obtain the undivided\r\nsupport of the South and South-West,” and thus throw the contest into\r\nthe House and defeat Van Buren.[871] Thus all the elements were present\r\nto make his disaffection probable. Hurt by what he conceived to be\r\nJackson’s ingratitude, jealous of the new friends that haunted the White\r\nHouse, importuned by the anti-Administration Democrats, and cleverly\r\nencouraged by the Whigs, he was gradually pushed into the attitude of a\r\ncandidate. To all of these, the gossips of the day, malignant as always,\r\nadded a new reason, which they insisted was the predominant one--the\r\nambition of his wife.[872]\r\n\r\nJust before he decided upon the plunge, the Whigs had been assiduous in\r\ntheir cultivation of him, and ardent in their expressions of sympathy\r\nbecause of the harsh treatment accorded him by his old friend in the\r\nWhite House. One of the most persistent of the tempters was Clay’s\r\nintimate and reflector, R. P. Letcher, Representative from Kentucky, who\r\nhad maintained the most constant social relations with the Whites during\r\nthe preceding winter, ingratiating himself into the old man’s\r\nconfidence, and frequently enjoying the hospitality of his home. The\r\nhollow mockery of Letcher’s attachment appeared in a letter to a friend,\r\nwritten a little later, in which he galloped over the gossip of the\r\ncapital, and announced that “Judge White is on the track running gaily,\r\nand won’t come off; and if he would, his wife wouldn’t let him.”[873] A\r\nmore suspicious man than the Tennessee Senator might have found, in\r\nthis, evidence of treachery and duplicity. The slur on Mrs. White was\r\nresented by Blair, in a stinging editorial in the “Globe,” but his\r\nexcoriation of Letcher does not appear to have given White a more\r\nfavorable impression of the editor.[874] The intimation regarding Mrs.\r\nWhite was basely false, the slur wholly unjustified.\r\n\r\nBy the spring of 1834, White had announced his candidacy and the gage\r\nof battle was thus thrown down to Jackson in Tennessee, which became the\r\nbattle-ground. In the autumn of that year, while on a visit to the\r\nHermitage, Jackson, on learning of the partiality of many for the\r\nSenator, had entered into a warm defense of his favorite, ridiculed the\r\nprospects of White outside his own State, and, in more conciliatory\r\nmood, proposed the nomination of the Tennesseean for Vice-President with\r\na view to the succession on the expiration of Van Buren’s term. Learning\r\nof these interviews, White wrote to James K. Polk, knowing his intimacy\r\nwith the President, inquiring as to his information on the presidential\r\nposition, but the only satisfaction he received was a warning to give no\r\ncredence to any such gossip unless from an unquestionable source.[875]\r\nBut if Polk was not then familiar with Jackson’s uncompromising\r\nhostility to White’s aspirations, he was not to remain long in doubt. It\r\nwas the plan of the Jackson organization in Tennessee, led by Polk and\r\nFelix Grundy, to simulate sympathy with the Senator’s ambition, and\r\npersuasively lead him into the shambles of the Baltimore Convention. But\r\nwhen he refused to go passively to the slaughter, and a meeting of the\r\nTennessee congressional delegation was called in the interest of his\r\ncandidacy, Polk and Grundy refused to attend, threw off the mask, and\r\ndeclared open war. Thus the fight was extended into the congressional\r\nelections in Tennessee in the summer of 1835, with Polk assuming the\r\nleadership of the Administration forces, taking the stump in opposition\r\nto White’s candidacy, and throwing the weight of his Nashville paper\r\ninto the scale. Henceforth Polk’s attitude was courageous. He would be\r\nglad to see a son of Tennessee elevated to the Presidency if it could be\r\ndone in regulation manner by the Democratic Party, but he would not\r\ncountenance any attempt to divide the party in the interest of the\r\nWhigs. The National Democracy favored Van Buren, and it was the duty of\r\nTennessee not to separate from the party in the Nation.\r\n\r\nThe elections resulted in the triumph of White’s followers, with\r\ncasualties among Jackson’s congressional followers, but Polk was\r\ntriumphantly reëlected, and he redoubled his efforts. At a series of\r\nbanquets he denounced the attempt of Democrats to create a schism in the\r\nface of the common enemy. But immediately afterwards the Legislature,\r\nthrough the adoption of resolutions, formally nominated White for the\r\nPresidency.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nAlthough the fame of Hugh Lawson White has been obscured by the years,\r\nhe was familiarly known to his generation as “the Cato of the Senate.”\r\nWithout sparkle or magnetism, the purity of his character, the soundness\r\nof his common sense, his fidelity to duty, and assiduous application\r\ncommanded respect if not admiration. His senatorial speeches were\r\nnoteworthy because of their temperate tone--rare in his generation.\r\nClarity and strength characterized his every utterance. If his speeches\r\nlacked eloquence, they smacked of statesmanship and substance. No member\r\nof the Senate more impressively looked the part. Tall, slender, and\r\nwell-proportioned, with a broad forehead and deep-set, serious,\r\npenetrating blue eyes, he was the embodiment of senatorial dignity. With\r\nlong gray hair, brushed back from his forehead, and curling at some\r\nlength on his shoulders, he appeared the patriarch. In repose, he was\r\nsad and stern. Because of the rarity and thoroughness of his speeches,\r\nhe commanded the respect and confidence of his colleagues. He looked\r\nupon his duties with the solemnity of the Roman Senator of the noblest\r\nperiod of the Roman Republic. Always heard with attention, he was\r\nattentive to others, and he was frequently the one listener to an\r\nuninteresting speech. Even in familiar conversation, he rarely jested\r\noutside the domestic circle, and, while an interesting and instructive\r\nconversationalist about his own fireside, he was apt to be taciturn and\r\nretiring in company. Had fate ordained that he should have reached the\r\nPresidency, he would have made a safe, conventional Executive, and he\r\nwould be remembered as a pure, patriotic public servant. Such was the\r\nman who was to give Jackson, in the election of his successor, his only\r\nuneasy hours.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThe concern of the Jackson organization over White’s candidacy may be\r\nread in the persistency of Blair’s vigorous denunciations in the\r\n“Washington Globe.” Beginning in the early spring and continuing\r\nthroughout the summer, the Administration organ teemed with attacks on\r\nthe Tennessee Senator and his most ardent champion, John Bell, Speaker\r\nof the House of Representatives. The ill-advised announcement of White’s\r\nfollowers that his candidacy was intended to destroy the landmarks of\r\nparty gave the editor his cue. “This artifice,” wrote Blair, “has been\r\nso frequently attempted, and in vain, by those seeking to divide and\r\ndestroy the Republican [Democratic] Party in this country, that we would\r\nhave supposed the design would not have been confessed on the part of\r\nthose supporting the interests of a man, who, up to the age of sixty, at\r\nleast has made it his boast to support his party firmly, as the only\r\nmeans of maintaining his principles. But he now seeks office at the\r\nhands of the Opposition, and like all new solicitors for the favor of\r\nFederalism, becomes a no-party man.”[876] The fact that White had voted\r\nwith the Whigs on the Fortifications Bill was made the text of many\r\ndiscourses on the questionable character of his patriotism; his\r\nconnection with Calhoun offered the opportunity to picture him as a\r\nhalf-disguised friend of Nullification. The encouragement given his\r\ncandidacy by the Whig leaders was interpreted as a desertion of the\r\nhouse of his friends to do the work of the enemy. Tying him up tightly\r\nwith the Whigs and the Nullifiers, attacking the no-party idea as a\r\nwooden horse of Troy in which discredited Federalism planned to reënter\r\nthe Capitol, Blair smote the Tennesseean hip and thigh throughout the\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\nBut scarcely less offensive to the “Globe” than White was John Bell, and\r\nthe determination of the organization to prevent his reëlection to the\r\nSpeakership was evident in the systematic attacks upon his record.\r\nBeginning in May, and continuing through the summer, there was scarcely\r\nan issue of the “Globe” that did not deal with some phase of Bell’s\r\nalleged perfidy, in a special article.[877] The virulent hostility to\r\nBell, of the Kitchen Cabinet, was not due in whole to his relations with\r\nthe candidacy of White. Following his election over Polk to the\r\nSpeakership, Duff Green, in the “Telegraph,” ascribed Polk’s defeat to\r\nhis support by the Kitchen Cabinet, and described “Kendall, Blair, and\r\nLewis parading the lobby” in attempts to drum up votes for their\r\nfavorite. This had been bluntly denied by Blair, who insisted that he\r\nhad spoken to no one on the Speakership, and that Lewis was “known to\r\nhave been inclined to Mr. Bell’s election.”[878] But the charge in the\r\n“Telegraph” had been accepted by many and the pride of the Jackson\r\nleaders had been aroused. The White candidacy, Bell’s espousal of it,\r\nand Polk’s determined stand against it, made it imperative that Bell\r\nshould be retired in the interest of Polk.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Baltimore Convention assembled on May 20, 1835--an\r\nassembly that no more deserves the popular reproach of being a\r\nconvention of office-holders than the average convention of the dominant\r\nparty ever since. The absence of delegates from South Carolina and\r\nIllinois was tolerable to the Jacksonians, but the failure of Tennessee\r\nto appear, notwithstanding the personal importunities of the President,\r\nwas painfully embarrassing. That had to be corrected. A comparatively\r\nunknown Tennesseean, E. Rucker, was found in the city, and literally\r\npushed into the convention to cast the unauthorized vote of\r\nTennessee--and thus the word “Ruckerize” was added to the vocabulary of\r\npractical politicians. The polished Andrew Stevenson, who had resigned\r\nthe Speakership to accept the diplomatic post in London, only to share\r\nthe fate of Van Buren, was called upon to deliver the “keynote” address\r\nin the capacity of chairman. But this honor, bestowed upon the\r\nVirginians, was more than neutralized by New York’s desertion of her\r\nVirginia allies in the nomination of the vice-presidential candidate.\r\n\r\nNever had the Old Dominion been dominated by a more powerful machine\r\nthan that led by Judge Spencer Roane, a man of great intellectual force,\r\nwho had been favored by Jefferson for the Chief Justiceship. He had a\r\npowerful colleague in his cousin, Thomas Ritchie, the forceful editor of\r\nthe “Richmond Enquirer.” Stevenson was an important member of the\r\nclique, and no one was closer to its leader than the scholarly Senator\r\nWilliam C. Rives, who had, as Jackson’s first Minister to France,\r\nnegotiated the indemnity settlement. The Virginians had early pledged\r\nthemselves to the political fortunes of Van Buren. The alliance of the\r\ntwo States, Virginia and New York, was one of the significant facts in\r\nthe politics of the day. Never doubting the loyalty of their ally, Roane\r\nand his organization determined to dictate the nomination of Rives for\r\nthe Vice-Presidency with a view to the succession. It was not until the\r\neve of the convention that the Virginians learned, to their dismay, that\r\nthe New Yorkers had other plans. Almost incredulous, chagrined,\r\ndisturbed, Ritchie hastened to write Rives of the new developments. He\r\nhad heard that “some of our strongest friends in Washington” were\r\nlooking with favor on Richard M. Johnson of Kentucky. Van Buren’s\r\npreference was a mystery. However, Ritchie had been pressing Rives’s\r\nclaims and had written letters, not only to delegates, but to “a\r\ngentleman in Washington, who can, if he thinks fit, exercise a sort of\r\npotential voice.” But unhappily for the Virginians, Lewis, Kendall,\r\nBlair, Silas Wright, and Hill were opportunists, with their eyes upon\r\nthe West, in view of the candidacy of both Harrison and White. It was\r\nclear to them that expediency demanded the nomination of a Westerner for\r\nthe Vice-Presidency. The stubborn, and now thoroughly outraged,\r\nVirginians refused to acquiesce in the reasoning of the Kitchen Cabinet,\r\nand Rives went down before the first of the “steam rollers” that have\r\nbecome so commonplace in national conventions.[879] Thoroughly disgusted\r\nby what they conceived to be a betrayal, the Virginia organization\r\ndeclared open war on Johnson, and Van Buren was much perturbed. But that\r\nwily diplomat, assisted by Silas Wright, immediately took personal\r\ncharge of the work of conciliation, writing numerous letters to Rives\r\nand Ritchie, and the storm was stilled for the time when Van Buren made\r\na journey to Castle Hill, the country home of the defeated candidate,\r\nwhere the fatted calf was killed and the leaders of the Roane\r\norganization were invited to participate in the feast and to accept the\r\napologies and pledges of the presidential nominee.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Whigs were in a quandary as to what to do, with their\r\ngreatest popular leader, noting a tendency to set him aside, spending\r\nthe summer at Ashland in bitterness of soul. In a letter written in July\r\nhe had unbosomed himself to a friend, with the confession that he had\r\nthought it probable that his party would again turn to him, but had\r\nnoted a tendency to “discourage the use of my name.” In Ohio, where he\r\nwas popular, the Legislature had discredited his possible candidacy by\r\nits endorsement of Justice McLean. In the spirit of an Achilles sulking\r\nin his tent, he discussed the various names canvassed, pointing out\r\ntheir weaknesses. White would be intolerable as a Whig candidate because\r\n“he has been throughout a supporter of the Jackson Administration and\r\nholds no principle, except in the matter of patronage, as to public\r\nmeasures, in common with the Whigs.” While he thought Webster’s\r\nattainments greatly superior to those of any other candidate, “it is to\r\nbe regretted that a general persuasion seems to exist that he stands no\r\nchance.” Harrison was damned with the faint praise that he “could easier\r\nobtain the vote of Kentucky than any other candidate named.” The only\r\nrift in the clouds that he could see was in the nomination of three\r\ncandidates, with White as one of the three, to draw off the Democratic\r\nstrength in the South and portions of the West, and the defeat of Van\r\nBuren by thus throwing the contest into the House.[880] That this plan\r\nwas uppermost in the minds of the Whigs is shown in a letter to Clay\r\nfrom James Barbour of Virginia, in August. Because of the slavery\r\nquestion, he thought White the strongest candidate to be pressed against\r\nVan Buren in Virginia. Webster was out of the question. McLean, not even\r\nconsidered. Harrison, after White, would make the strongest appeal. “It\r\nseems to me,” he continued, “that we have no prospect of excluding Van\r\nBuren but by the plan you suggest, of selecting two candidates who will\r\nbe the strongest in their respective sections. White, I apprehend, for\r\nthe South, Webster for the East, North and West, or whomsoever\r\nPennsylvania prefers.”[881] Thus, in the correspondence of the Whig\r\nleaders, we have the proof that White was intrigued into the race by the\r\nWhigs with the view to furthering their own interest, and not his.\r\n\r\nBy September, Clay, having met Harrison in Cincinnati, and finding him\r\n“respectful and cordial,” was more cordial toward his candidacy,\r\nalthough he preferred any choice Pennsylvania might announce. The Rhode\r\nIsland and Connecticut elections had shown that “it is in vain to look\r\neven to New England for the support of Mr. Webster.”[882] Out of this\r\nconfusion of counsels, Harrison ultimately emerged with the general\r\nsupport of the Whigs, but, like the Democrats, the Whigs were to be\r\nembarrassed by a double tail to their ticket. With the popular sentiment\r\nfavoring Tyler, the politicians, with their eyes on the Anti-Masons,\r\nnominated Granger. It was the contention of contemporaries that Clay,\r\nwho had engineered the move against Tyler, feared that the concentration\r\nof the Whigs on some strong candidate for the Vice-Presidency might\r\nresult in his election with Van Buren, because of the dissatisfaction of\r\nthe Virginia Whigs with Johnson; and that a Whig Vice-President, under a\r\nDemocratic President, would become a formidable rival for the\r\npresidential nomination in 1840.[883] Both Tyler and Granger, however,\r\nremained in the field, thus dividing the vote in the election.\r\n\r\nThe Massachusetts Whigs, nothing daunted by the turn of affairs,\r\nremained faithful to Webster, who was placed in the field; and in South\r\nCarolina, where Calhoun’s followers made a point of separating\r\nthemselves from all parties and all other States, Senator Willie P.\r\nMangum was nominated. Thus, in the campaign of 1836 there were five\r\ncandidates, with the Democrats united behind Van Buren, and the\r\nOpposition dividing its strength between Harrison, White, Webster, and\r\nMangum. Nothing could have been more to the liking of the Democracy. It\r\nentered the campaign in solid ranks except in Tennessee, where even the\r\nmagic name of Jackson was unable to prevent a schism which was to result\r\nin the humiliation of the venerable chief.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1835 the militant methods of the Abolitionists\r\nforced the slavery question to the front to the embarrassment of the\r\npoliticians and the candidates. The Nation was still on edge because of\r\nthe anti-slavery and anti-abolition riots of the year before, when\r\nGeorge Thompson, the Abolition firebrand from England, arrived in\r\nAmerica with exhortations to the Northerners to end slavery at once. The\r\nSouth was outraged, the North, shocked. Coincident with Thompson’s mad\r\ncrusade, the American Anti-Slavery Society, having collected a large sum\r\nof money for the purpose, began to circularize the country, and\r\nespecially the South, with literature calculated to arouse the slaves to\r\ninsurrection.[884] The defense of the abolitionists was that the\r\nliterature was sent to the whites alone; but much of it fell into the\r\nhands of the blacks, and excitement reached fever heat. In Philadelphia\r\na pouch of these tracts was confiscated by a mob, and sunk in the\r\nDelaware River. In Charleston the mail was searched for them, and three\r\nthousand citizens assembled at night to witness their destruction in a\r\nbonfire. Mass meetings were held in all the larger Northern cities to\r\ndenounce the desperate enterprise of the abolitionists, and in Boston\r\nthe citizens packed Faneuil Hall to hear Harrison Gray Otis denounce\r\nthem in a spirited address. When Thompson, in one of his inflammatory\r\nspeeches, proposed that the slaves should arise and cut their masters’\r\nthroats, the bitterness in the North was as pronounced as in the South,\r\nand after Garrison had narrowly escaped the rope through the\r\nintercession of the Mayor of Boston, whom he had scathingly attacked in\r\nhis paper, the English orator went into hiding until he could be\r\nspirited out of the country. The most important effect of this miserable\r\nblunder of the abolitionists was to force the slavery question into\r\npolitics, and from that hour on, the slave-owners of the South became\r\ndominant in the politics of the Republic.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that Jackson, like all other responsible leaders, abhorred\r\nthese appeals to the slaves to rise and cut their masters’ throats. The\r\nburden of dealing with an important phase of the problem, the\r\ntransmission of such matter through the mail, fell upon the\r\nAdministration, and in the absence of any law to prevent it. But when\r\nthe postmasters of New York and Charleston wrote Postmaster-General\r\nKendall for instructions, that astute politician replied that the United\r\nStates should not carry such matter in the mail; and, acting upon the\r\nhint, the postmasters threw all such matter out with the tacit consent\r\nof the Government.\r\n\r\nThe Opposition, however, planned to turn the hatred of the abolitionists\r\nagainst Van Buren, who was hostile to the extension of slavery. Writing\r\nto Clay in the late summer of 1835, Senator Barbour rejoiced in the\r\ninjection of the slavery question as certain to injure the Democratic\r\nnominee.[885] The close political associates of Van Buren were keenly\r\nalive to the danger, and John Forsyth wrote him that unless something\r\nshould be done in New York he “should not be at all surprised at a\r\ndecisive movement to establish a Southern Confederacy,” and suggested\r\nthat “a portion of the Magician’s skill is required in this matter ...\r\nand the sooner you set the imps to work the better.”[886] Whether the\r\nwily politician “set the imps to work” we do not know, but within a\r\nmonth of the writing of the letter the New York postmaster publicly\r\nannounced that he would refuse to forward the objectionable literature.\r\nThis was given the widest publicity; so, too, the letter of Amos Kendall\r\naccepting and endorsing the action of the New York official. And about\r\nthe same time, whether due to the Van Buren “imps” or not, one of the\r\ngreatest meetings ever held in New York was held in the park to denounce\r\nthe methods of the abolitionists. Nothing was done by Van Buren\r\npersonally, in a public way, to divorce himself from all sympathy with\r\nthe abolition movement.\r\n\r\nThe Whig nominee, determined publicly to repudiate the abolition\r\nmethods, found an opportunity at a dinner in his honor at Vincennes,\r\nIndiana, in a speech intended as a friendly gesture to the slave-holding\r\nStates, and for the cultivation of such of those in Virginia as were\r\nprone to associate Van Buren with the abolition sentiment in portions of\r\nNew York.[887] The position of White was as clearly fixed on slavery as\r\nthat of Calhoun, and we shall observe a little later how the latter\r\nsought to place Van Buren in a position hostile to Southern interests.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Van Buren serenely went his way, undisturbed by the storm, and\r\nin the best of humor. Soon after the Baltimore Convention, the most\r\nunconventional campaign biography ever published in America was issued\r\nby a Philadelphia publishing house and given an extensive circulation.\r\nThe present generation scarcely realizes that there were two Davy\r\nCrocketts--the man of the woods and the fight, and the less admirable\r\ncreature who made a rather sorry figure in the Congress. It was the\r\nlatter who was persuaded to write a part, and to father all, of this\r\nscurrilous biography of Van Buren, although it is generally accepted\r\nthat Hugh Lawson White, the man of ponderous dignity and lofty ideals,\r\nwas the man behind this questionable literary venture.[888] The personal\r\nreferences to Van Buren are crudely and coarsely offensive throughout.\r\n\r\n“He is about fifty years old,” he wrote, “and notwithstanding his\r\nbaldness, which reaches all around and half down his head, like a white\r\npitch plaster, leaving a few white floating locks, he is only three\r\nyears older than I am. His face is a good deal shriveled, and he looks\r\nsorry, not for anything he has gained, but what he may lose.”[889] In\r\ndescribing his subject’s mental operations, he found that “his mind\r\nbeats round, like a tame bear tied to a stake, in a little circle,\r\nhardly bigger than the circumference of the head in which it is placed,\r\nseeking no other object than to convert the Government into an\r\ninstrument to serve himself or his office-holding friends.”[890]\r\n\r\nIn explaining Van Buren’s rise, the hero of young Texas proceeded: “He\r\nhas become a great man without any reason for it, and so have I. He has\r\nbeen nominated for President without the least pretensions; and so have\r\nI. But here the similarity stops. From his cradle he was on the\r\nnon-committal tribe. I never was. He had always two ways to do a thing;\r\nI never had but one. He was generally half bent; I tried to be as\r\nstraight as a gun barrel. He could not bear his rise; I never minded\r\nmine. He forgot all his old associates because they were poor folks; I\r\nstuck to the people that made me.”[891]\r\n\r\nAnd in a superb bit of demagogy, Crockett described Van Buren as\r\ntraveling through the country in an English coach with “English servants\r\ndressed in uniform--I think they call it livery”; refusing to mix “with\r\nthe sons of the little tavern-keepers,” forgetting “his old companions\r\nand friends in the humbler walks of life”; eating “in a room by\r\nhimself,” and carrying himself “so stiff in his gait and prim in his\r\ndress, that he was what the English call a Dandy.” The reader was\r\nassured that “when he enters the Senate Chamber in the morning, he\r\nstruts and swaggers like a crow in a gutter,” that he “is laced up in\r\ncorsets such as women in town wear, and if possible tighter than the\r\nbest of them.” Indeed, Crockett found it “difficult to tell from his\r\npersonal appearance whether he was a man or a woman.”[892] The Eaton\r\nscandal was salaciously served anew, the fight between Jackson and\r\nBenton was described in detail, and, unfortunately for his candidate for\r\nPresident, a chapter was devoted to a hot defense of White on the Bank\r\nand on the Fortifications Bill.\r\n\r\nThe book, now happily forgotten, is only interesting and historically\r\nimportant in indicating the tone of the political contests of the time,\r\nand the scurrility of the attacks on Van Buren in the campaign. If the\r\nLittle Magician enjoyed the queer concoction, it was not without the\r\nrealization of its possibility for doing harm. At any rate, a little\r\nlater, another and a friendly biography by Holland was published,\r\nseriously reviewing Van Buren’s public career. While not written in bad\r\ntaste, it aroused the ire of John Quincy Adams who took the time to read\r\nit. “A mere partisan electioneering work,” he wrote in his diary. “Van\r\nBuren’s personal character bears, however, a stronger resemblance to\r\nthat of Mr. Madison than to that of Mr. Jefferson. These are both\r\nremarkable for their extreme caution in avoiding and averting personal\r\ncollisions. Van Buren, like the Sosie of Molière’s ‘Amphitryon,’ is\r\n‘l’ami de tout le monde.’ This is perhaps the secret of his great\r\nsuccess in public life, and especially against the competitors with whom\r\nhe is now struggling for the last step on the ladder of his\r\nambition--Henry Clay and John C. Calhoun. They, indeed, are left upon\r\nthe field for dead; and men of straw, Hugh L. White, William Henry\r\nHarrison, and Daniel Webster, are thrust forward in their places.\r\nNeither of these has a principle to lean upon.”[893]\r\n\r\nIf these intrigues and attacks disturbed Van Buren in the least, he gave\r\nno sign. During a ten-day sojourn in New York in October, Philip Hone,\r\nwho vainly sought an open date to entertain him at dinner, found “his\r\noutward appearance like the unruffled surface of the majestic river\r\nwhich covers rocks and whirlpools, but shows no marks of the agitation\r\nbeneath.”[894] In this same good temper, he faced the ordeal of\r\npresiding over the Senate, dominated by his political foes, in the long\r\nsession preceding the election. We shall here find him threading his way\r\namong pitfalls provided by his enemies with such skill as to conceal all\r\neffort.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nThe halls of Congress in the session of December, 1835, were used as the\r\nhustings, and there, largely, the presidential battle was fought. The\r\nfirst blow was struck by the Jacksonians in the election of Polk to the\r\nSpeakership, over Bell. The latter was a man of much capacity,\r\nconsidered by Van Buren as the intellectual superior of White, and he\r\nhad been elected to the Speakership, on the resignation of Stevenson,\r\nthrough a combination of the Whigs and anti-Administration Democrats. In\r\nseeking a reconciliation with the Jacksonians, he had hinted at a desire\r\nfor a confidential conference with Van Buren, and the two were finally\r\ninvited to dine with a mutual friend. Unhappily for Bell, a severe\r\ntoothache, real or diplomatic, forced the candidate of the Jacksonian\r\nDemocracy to retire the moment the ladies left the table. When a few\r\ndays later the two found themselves together on the speakers’ rostrum on\r\nthe occasion of the delivery of Adams’s oration on Lafayette, Bell had\r\nattempted to discuss the differences of the factions, but the canny Red\r\nFox “put a civil end to the conversation with a few general remarks in\r\nregard to the duty the friends of Judge White owed” to the party, and\r\nsoon afterward the Tennessee Senator had entered the field, and Bell was\r\nforced to espouse his cause.[895] Thus the course of history may have\r\nbeen changed by the toothache of a politician. At any rate, it was\r\nenough, to the Jacksonian leaders, to know that Polk had risked his\r\npopularity and future by taking the offensive in favor of Van Buren, and\r\nhe was rewarded with the Speakership.\r\n\r\nThe Whigs instantly accepted the challenge by bitterly opposing the\r\nconfirmation of Roger B. Taney as Chief Justice of the United States. No\r\none questioned his professional ability or his eminent fitness for a\r\nhigh judicial position. Bitterly hostile as he was to Jackson’s Bank\r\npolicy, John Marshall had recognized Taney’s qualifications for the\r\nbench when the President had previously made an unsuccessful attempt to\r\nelevate his former Secretary of the Treasury to that tribunal. At that\r\ntime the venerable Chief Justice had quietly interested himself in his\r\nsuccessor’s behalf, and among the papers of Senator Leigh, still in\r\npossession of the family, is the brief but significant note from\r\nMarshall: “If you have not made up your mind on the nomination of Mr.\r\nTaney, I have received some information in his favor which I would wish\r\nto communicate.”[896] But after Marshall’s death and Taney’s\r\nappointment, the Whig and pro-Bank politicians attempted to array all\r\nthe late jurist’s friends and admirers against the confirmation by\r\npicturing Jackson as not only hostile to the trend of his decisions, but\r\nto the perpetuation of his memory. The “Richmond Whig” announced that\r\n“he [Jackson] thinks undue honors have been rendered to the memory of\r\nGeneral Marshall, and predicts that the attempt to build a monument to\r\nhis memory in Washington will fail.” This was a willful perversion of a\r\ncomment actually made to the editor of the “Southern Literary Messenger”\r\nat Rip Raps, that, in view of Jackson’s inability to interest Congress\r\nin an appropriation for a monument to Washington, he was afraid that it\r\nwould be impossible to build one to Marshall.[897] But the idea of the\r\nfighting Secretary of the Treasury in the seat of Marshall was maddening\r\nto the Whig leaders, and the nomination was attacked with intemperance\r\nand even scurrility by both Webster and Clay, and it was not until in\r\nMarch, three months after the nomination was sent to the Senate, that it\r\nwas confirmed.\r\n\r\nBut the appearance of resolutions from legislatures, instructing Whig\r\nand pro-Bank Senators to vote to expunge the resolution of censure\r\nagainst Jackson, was the most bitter pill of all. Not only did it\r\nfurther embitter the Whigs against the Administration, but it put them\r\nat loggerheads with each other. This was especially true of the Whig\r\nSenators from Virginia, Tyler and Leigh, who took opposite views as to\r\nthe inviolability of instructions. Throughout his entire career, Tyler\r\nhad stoutly insisted upon the right of the people, speaking through\r\ntheir legislatures, to instruct their representatives in the Senate.\r\nThis position had been adopted by the Virginia Whigs, and accepted by\r\nthe people of the State. Because of this, Leigh now sat in the Senate,\r\nin the seat from which Rives had been instructed. But when a resolution\r\nwas introduced in the Virginia Assembly, instructing the Senators from\r\nthat State to vote to expunge, the Whigs began to divide on the question\r\nof compliance in the event of its adoption. There was never any question\r\nas to the attitude of John Tyler. Pilloried in history as a second-rate\r\npolitician and a weakling, it is impossible to study his career without\r\nbeing impressed with his consistency, which was all too rare in his\r\ngeneration, and the unfaltering courage with which he lived up to his\r\nprinciples, regardless of the effect upon his personal fortunes. But\r\nLeigh, who owed his seat in the Senate to the principle of instructions,\r\nwas made of less heroic clay. With the encouragement of Virginians,\r\nincluding Judge Brooke, who always reflected the views of Henry Clay, he\r\nbegan to hedge. Senator Barbour, another of Clay’s intimates, urged upon\r\nTyler sophisticated reasons for ignoring the instructions.[898] When the\r\nresolutions were adopted in the lower branch of the legislature, the\r\npressure of the Whigs to ignore them met with a gracious yielding on the\r\npart of Leigh, and the unscrupulous partisans were able to concentrate\r\ntheir efforts on Tyler. Such was the logic of party bigotry in 1836 that\r\nthe Maryland Legislature, which had nominated Tyler for the\r\nVice-Presidency, threatened to rescind the nomination if he complied\r\nwith the instructions, and the future President, the truckling, tricky\r\npolitician of historical caricature, expressed his disgust in a letter\r\nto his son: “These incidents look almost like a political romance in\r\nthese days when everything is surrendered for office.... Give me the\r\nassurance that history will do me justice ... and I will go to my grave\r\nin peace.”[899] When the resolution was passed by both branches, and\r\ncertified to the two Senators, Tyler, without a moment’s hesitation,\r\nresigned in a dignified letter to Van Buren, and retired to private\r\nlife. Leigh ignored the instructions and retained his seat, but resigned\r\nin July. This contradiction sadly crippled the Whigs in Virginia; and\r\nwhen, during the spring, a dinner was given the two Senators by their\r\nfellow partisans, and Tyler was lauded for his act, the spicy Thomas\r\nRitchie, of the “Richmond Enquirer,” insisted that two of the toasts\r\nwere:\r\n\r\n“John Tyler: Honor to him, because he could not, with honor, retain his\r\nseat.”\r\n\r\n“Senator Leigh: Honor to him, because he could not, with honor,\r\nrelinquish his seat.”\r\n\r\nThus Tyler passed from the ranks of the Opposition in the Senate, and\r\nWilliam C. Rives, the friend of Jackson and Van Buren, vindicated by\r\nevents, returned to strengthen the forces of the Administration.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of Ewing of Ohio toward similar resolutions by the\r\nlegislature of his State was that of Leigh.[900]\r\n\r\nAll these manifestations of popular approval of the Administration, and\r\ndissatisfaction with the Whigs and their allies in the Senate, tended to\r\ninfuriate the Opposition which found itself helpless before the tide. In\r\nTennessee, however, the Administration was unable to secure instructions\r\naimed at White, and the attempt merely furnished the opportunity for\r\nlaudatory speeches on the Tennessee Senator, and bitter denunciations of\r\nthe proposal to expunge. This defeat in Tennessee was the only hopeful\r\nsign that reached the Whigs in Washington.[901]\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the congressional session was devoted to some phase\r\nof the abolition agitation, and Calhoun bent all his efforts toward\r\narraying the North and South against each other. He seemed determined to\r\nhave it that the Northern people were in sympathy with the methods and\r\npurposes of the radical followers of Garrison. The mobs that had all but\r\nlynched Garrison, and forced the friends of Thompson to spirit him away,\r\nwere Northern mobs. If the obnoxious literature had been burned by the\r\npeople of Charleston, it had been thrown into the river by the people of\r\nPhiladelphia and denounced by the people of Boston. No Northern\r\nstatesman or politician had raised a voice in defense of the\r\nabolitionists, and most of them vied with Calhoun in their denunciation\r\nof them. But when, on January 7th, an abolition petition was presented,\r\nand Calhoun moved that it be not received and supported his motion in an\r\nintemperate speech, some of the most pronounced pro-slavery Senators\r\ntook alarm. The great Nullifier declared that an irrepressible fight had\r\nbeen forced and should be met. “We must meet the enemy on the\r\nfrontier--on the question of receiving,” he said. “We must secure that\r\nimportant pass--it is our Thermopylæ. The power of resistance, by the\r\nuniversal law, is on the exterior. Break through the shell, penetrate\r\nthe crust, and there is no resistance within.” When, four days later,\r\nBuchanan presented a petition for the abolition of slavery in the\r\nDistrict of Columbia and moved that it be received and rejected, Calhoun\r\ndemanded that the question be put first on receiving, and a debate was\r\nprecipitated which dragged along for weary weeks, ending in the defeat\r\nof Calhoun’s plan.\r\n\r\nDuring the period of these intermittent discussions, the “Telegraph,”\r\nreflector of Calhoun, teemed with articles bitterly attacking, not so\r\nmuch the abolitionists as the North. This determination to treat the\r\nNortherners as enemies of Southern institutions was so apparent that a\r\nnumber of pro-slavery Southern Senators were moved to protest and to\r\ncriticism of the Southern leader. Whether he was actuated, that early,\r\nby a desire to lay the foundation for a Southern Confederacy, or merely\r\nused this method to create feeling in the Southern States against the\r\ncandidacy of Van Buren, can never be determined. But the Democrats\r\nsupporting Van Buren had no doubt that the latter was the dominating\r\nmotive. The sharp-tongued Isaac Hill, of New Hampshire, in a fierce\r\nassault on Calhoun’s position, directly charged that the “Telegraph” had\r\nbeen exerting itself from the time of the Nullification movement to\r\ndrive a wedge between the sections, and warned Calhoun that the\r\nagitation he was forcing on Congress played directly into the hands of\r\nthe abolitionists. But the latter had determined upon his course, and\r\nappeared not only willing, but anxious, actually to break with the\r\nfriends of the South among the Northerners in Congress.\r\n\r\nIf he expected, however, in his fight against receiving the petitions,\r\nto prove Van Buren hostile to the interest of the South, he failed. The\r\nten votes he mustered were recruited from both parties. Five were\r\nWhigs,[902] three were Democrats supporting the Administration,[903] and\r\ntwo were against the Administration and hostile to Van Buren.[904]\r\nThus, with the exception of three Senators, all the supporters of Van\r\nBuren and the Administration voted to receive the petitions. The vote of\r\nWhite was unquestionably political, intended to strengthen his candidacy\r\namong the pro-slavery radicals of the Southern States.\r\n\r\nBut Calhoun was not discouraged. His political motive was more apparent\r\nin the battle over his bill to regulate the transmission of the mails,\r\nand exclude therefrom all abolition literature intended for the\r\nslave-holding States. We have noted the excitement of the preceding\r\nsummer, and the attitude of Kendall. In his Message at the opening of\r\nCongress, Jackson had recommended the enactment of such a law “as will\r\nprohibit, under severe penalties, the circulation in the Southern\r\nStates, through the mail, of incendiary publications intended to\r\ninstigate the slaves to insurrection.” Calhoun had eagerly seized upon\r\nthis recommendation to move its reference to a special committee,\r\ninstead of to the regularly organized Committee on Post-Offices.\r\nBuchanan opposed the suggestion on the ground that the unusual course\r\nwould tend to increase the excitement of the people.[905] Grundy of\r\nTennessee held that the very fact that the majority of the Committee on\r\nPost-Offices came from a section not directly interested would give more\r\nweight to its recommendations.[906] King of Alabama took advantage of\r\nCalhoun’s queer disclaimer of a political motive to insinuate its\r\nexistence, and favored the regular course for the reasons advanced by\r\nBuchanan.[907] Leigh supported Calhoun’s plan on the fantastic ground\r\nthat since the obnoxious mail could not be excluded by the existing\r\npost-office regulations, the Committee on Post-Offices was clearly not\r\nthe proper body.[908] But it was left to Preston of South Carolina to\r\nexplain bluntly the motive of Calhoun. Since the South was especially\r\ninterested, the committee should be composed of Senators from the\r\nslave-holding States. The Senate good-naturedly consented to Calhoun’s\r\nplan, and a special committee was named with Calhoun as chairman.\r\n\r\nA little later, an extreme bill, professing to meet the views of the\r\nPresident, was submitted, accompanied by an inflammatory report,\r\nreiterative of the compact theory of the Constitution, and calculated\r\nfurther to fan the excitement on the subject of abolition. Both the\r\nAdministration and Whig leaders were hostile to the measure, but it best\r\nserved the purpose of Calhoun to ignore the Whigs and to harp\r\nincessantly upon the opposition from Senators close to the Jackson-Van\r\nBuren organization. The report, according to the interpretation of\r\nCalhoun, set forth three propositions: that the National Government had\r\nno right to prohibit papers, no right to say what papers should be\r\ntransmitted, and that these rights belonged to the States.[909] The bill\r\nprovided that it should be a crime for a postmaster knowingly to receive\r\nand put into the mail any written, printed, or pictorial matter\r\nconcerning slavery, directed to any post-office in a State which\r\nprohibited the circulation of such matter; that such literature, if not\r\nwithdrawn from the mails within a given time, should be burned; and it\r\nmade the Postmaster-General and all his subordinates responsible for the\r\nenforcement of the law.\r\n\r\nEarly in the debate the political motive appeared when King of Alabama\r\nagain charged Calhoun with being moved by hostility to Jackson. What,\r\nexclaimed the bristling Carolinian, “I have too little respect for\r\nGeneral Jackson’s judgment, and if he were not President of the United\r\nStates, I would say for his character, to place myself in such a\r\nposition.”[910] On the following day we find him striking the same note:\r\n“I cannot but be surprised at the course of the friends of the\r\nExecutive,” he said. “I have heard Senators denounce this measure,\r\nrecommended by the Executive, as unconstitutional, as tyrannical, as an\r\nabuse of power, who never before dared whisper a word against the\r\nAdministration. Is it because the present Executive is going out of\r\npower that his influence is declining?”[911] This constant harping on\r\nthe attitude of the Administration Senators, whether so intended or not,\r\nwas looked upon by them as an attempt to make political capital against\r\nVan Buren in the slave States. “I wish the gentleman would restrain the\r\nfrequent repetition of such expressions,” said Cuthbert of Georgia, “as\r\nthey necessarily bring on him a suspicion of his sincerity. Why should\r\nthis be a party question? It would show a wickedness, a recklessness of\r\nthe welfare of our common country for any man to endeavor to make it\r\nso.”[912]\r\n\r\nBut Calhoun persisted in his attempt to maneuver the friends of Van\r\nBuren into an attitude offensive to the Southern States. Benton notes,\r\nsignificantly, that it was rather remarkable that three tie votes\r\noccurred in succession, two on amendments, and one on the engrossment of\r\nthe bill. His clear implication is that this was done to force Van Buren\r\nto cast a deciding vote, never doubting that it would be hostile to the\r\nmeasure. When the bill came up for engrossment, Calhoun demanded an aye\r\nand nay vote. When three men appeared to make a majority, three on the\r\nother side instantly appeared. At the time the vote was being taken, Van\r\nBuren had left the chair and was pacing up and down, concealed by the\r\ncolonnade, behind the rostrum. Benton says that “his eyes were wide open\r\nto see what would happen.”[913] He observed the keen eyes of the excited\r\nCalhoun searching the chamber for his anticipated prey. He heard him ask\r\n“eagerly and loudly” where the Vice-President had gone, and demand that\r\nthe sergeant-at-arms look for him. But Van Buren had heard and seen all,\r\nand, when the time came, he calmly took the chair, and with his\r\ncharacteristic serenity cast the deciding vote in favor of engrossment.\r\nBenton was positive that had he voted otherwise the Calhoun faction,\r\nwith the aid of the “Telegraph,” would have inflamed the South against\r\nhim. This would have been all the easier because Hugh Lawson White, who\r\nwas playing openly for the extreme State-Rights and pro-slavery support,\r\nvoted for the bill. But Van Buren and his friends were not blind to the\r\nconspiracy, and the two Democratic Senators from New York, intimate\r\npolitical friends of the presidential nominee, ascertaining first that\r\ntheir votes were not needed to defeat the measure, cast expediency votes\r\nin its favor, and thus robbed Calhoun and White of the opportunity to\r\nmake political capital out of the bill. It was defeated by a vote of 25\r\nto 19.[914]\r\n\r\nThus the session dragged on into June, with none of the parties gaining\r\nany material advantage for the purposes of the campaign. As the session\r\nwas drawing to a close, Senator White, who took his candidacy more to\r\nheart than any of the other candidates, made a discussion of the\r\nresolution to expunge the occasion for an acidulous attack upon Jackson\r\nin the presence of Van Buren, who serenely presided. He charged that\r\nJackson had “made up his mind who should be his successor,” and had used\r\nall the power of patronage to destroy him (White). With great\r\nparticularity, he went over the part the President was taking in the\r\ncanvass then on, the letters he had written, the copies of the\r\n“Washington Globe” he had personally franked, the material he had\r\nfurnished White’s enemies upon the stump in Tennessee.[915] The personal\r\ntone of the attack appears to have made a painful impression even upon\r\nWhite’s friends, and certainly did not disturb the smiling complacency\r\nof Van Buren, who listened with courteous attention. The “Congressional\r\nGlobe” of the session is filled with such assaults on Jackson and his\r\nAdministration, but the Big-Wigs of both parties, with the exception of\r\nCalhoun and White, maintained an unusual reserve. But Calhoun did his\r\npart in full measure. Not only did he abuse Jackson with indecent\r\ninvective, but, in the presence of Van Buren, sneered at the latter’s\r\ncharacter and ability. Jackson had “courage and firmness; is warlike,\r\nbold, audacious; but he is not true to his word and violates the most\r\nsolemn pledges without scruple.” He had “done the State some service,\r\ntoo, which is remembered greatly to his advantage.” But Van Buren “has\r\nnone of these recommendations.” No, as Senator Mangum[916] had said, he\r\n“has none of the lion or tiger breed about him; he belongs more to the\r\nfox and the weasel.”[917]\r\n\r\nWith nothing better to offer than this, the tired statesmen adjourned on\r\nJuly 4th, and hastened to their homes, some to sulk in their tents in\r\ndisgust, others to take the field to wage the fight.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nIn 1836 the issues of the campaign were not so clearly defined by\r\nconditions as in 1832, nor by platform declarations, as in more recent\r\nyears. The party declarations of principle had no meaning. That of the\r\nDemocrats could have summed up all in the endorsement of the Jackson\r\nAdministration and a pledge to continue the Jacksonian policies; that of\r\nthe Whigs in a denunciation of the principles and policies of Jacksonian\r\nDemocracy.\r\n\r\nThe platform of Senator White is found in his letter in reply to that of\r\na committee informing him of his nomination--a personal protest. “When\r\nan attempt is made,” he wrote, “to create a party not founded upon\r\nsettled political principles, composed of men belonging to every\r\npolitical sect, having no common bond of unity save that of a wish to\r\nplace one of themselves in the highest office known to the Constitution,\r\nfor the purpose of having all the honors, offices, and emoluments of the\r\nGovernment distributed by them among their followers, I consider such an\r\nassociation, whether composed of many or a few, a mere faction, which\r\nought to be resisted by every man who loves his country, and wishes to\r\nperpetuate its liberties.”[918]\r\n\r\nThe most influential leaders of the Whigs were not enthusiastic over any\r\nof the Opposition candidates, with the exception of Webster, who\r\nmanifestly had no chance. “White and Webster are now the golden calves\r\nof the people,” wrote the caustic Adams, “and their dull sayings are\r\nrepeated for wit, and their grave inanity is passed off for wisdom. This\r\nbolstering up of mediocrity would seem not suited to sustain much\r\nenthusiasm.” Such as there was, the cynical Puritan ascribed to the fact\r\nthat “a practice of betting has crept in,” and “that adds a spur of\r\nprivate, personal, and pecuniary interest to the impulse of\r\npatriotism.”[919] Naturally, Adams was not enamoured of Van Buren, who\r\nimpressed him as a “demagogue of the same school [as “Ike” Hill] with a\r\ntincture of aristocracy--an amalgamated metal of lead and copper.”[920]\r\n\r\nThere was no hero worshiping of the candidates in 1836, but the worship\r\nof Jackson continued, and the Whigs contemplated the phenomenon with\r\nmelancholy misgivings. Philip Hone, that faithful chronicler of Whig\r\nsentiment, found the political aspect of the country “worse than ever.”\r\nIndeed, “General Jackson’s star is still in the ascendant and shines\r\nbrighter than ever.” A month before the nomination of Van Buren, the\r\nWhig diarist had been forced to admit that business conditions had\r\nvastly improved.[921] In truth the Whigs were without an issue they\r\ndared advance, and could hope for success only through the amalgamation\r\nof all the disgruntled with the Whigs--the Anti-Masons, Nullifiers,\r\nState-Rights extremists, and disappointed office-seekers--and this was\r\nmanifestly impossible.\r\n\r\nThe campaign was not so exciting as that of 1832, and lacked the\r\nhysteria of the stump which characterized that of 1840. The newspapers\r\nwere relied upon largely for propaganda, and the “Globe” was summoned to\r\nherculean efforts. To meet the work of Blair, a campaign paper, called\r\nthe “Appeal,” was established in Washington to advocate the claims of\r\nWhite. The “Telegraph,” edited by the frenzied Duff Green, viciously\r\nattacked both Jackson and Van Buren. And the work of these papers\r\ncolored that of all the minor papers of the country. But the people\r\nremained calm and indifferent. The attacks upon the candidates, many\r\nbald slanders, stirred no one but the politicians. The custom of\r\ninterrogating candidates had now become fixed, and the three aspirants\r\nwere bombarded with questions covering a multitude of subjects.\r\n\r\nThe followers of Calhoun feverishly continued their efforts to embarrass\r\nVan Buren on the abolition movement. From North Carolina came a demand\r\nfor his position on the right of Congress to abolish slavery in the\r\nDistrict of Columbia. His answer was not as definite as the questioner\r\nhad hoped. There was no question as to the right of Congress to act in\r\nthe District, but the wily candidate had no intention to give a curt\r\nreply. His answer was that Congress had no right to interfere with\r\nslavery in the States--a question not put; and that he was opposed to\r\nthe abolishment of slavery in the District by congressional\r\naction--which was not a reply at all.\r\n\r\nThen followed the questions of the Equal Righters, or Locofocos, as they\r\nwere dubbed in New York by the “Courier and Enquirer,” as to Van Buren’s\r\nposition on their “declaration of rights.” The reply of the Red Fox,\r\nthat his long public career furnished a sufficient illumination of his\r\nposition on the general principles of the new party, was considered by\r\nthe Locos as an “evasion,” and denounced as unsatisfactory “to any true\r\nDemocrat.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Clay was exercising an unnatural restraint on his partisan\r\nzeal, remaining in strict retirement at Ashland, tending his cattle,\r\nlooking over his fields, writing an occasional letter, and meditating a\r\nretirement from the Senate before the next session. During the preceding\r\nwinter, the death of a favorite daughter had crushed him to the earth.\r\nHe keenly felt the apparent neglect of his party. In the canvass he took\r\nno part. It was not until the campaign was nearing its close, in\r\nOctober, that he appeared upon the platform to discuss the candidates,\r\nand then with evident reluctance. A barbecue had been arranged at\r\nLexington, within sight of Clay’s home, and a declination to participate\r\nwould have given deadly offense. He spoke, however, with unusual\r\ntemperance, urging a unification of the opposition against Van Buren.\r\nThis was to have been expected. Paying tribute to the civic worth of\r\nWhite, he announced his intention to vote for Harrison, not because he\r\nwas his first choice--for he pretended to prefer Webster--but because he\r\nthought that Harrison “combined the greatest prospects of defeating Mr.\r\nVan Buren.”[922]\r\n\r\nIf Clay was indifferent, his old rival, Andrew Jackson, was not.\r\nAssuming the certainty of his favorite’s election, his personal pride\r\nwas touched by White’s challenge of his own leadership in Tennessee, and\r\nas soon as Congress adjourned, he started on the long and tiresome\r\njourney to the Hermitage. Passing through eastern Tennessee, he\r\nappeared frankly in the rôle of a canvasser for votes. With old-time\r\nfire, he denounced his erstwhile friend, the Senator, as a Federalist--a\r\ndiscovery he had but recently made; and with all the fervor of\r\nJacksonian friendship he held Van Buren up as the purest and most\r\nuncompromising of Democrats. The domineering quality of his leadership\r\nflared in his declaration that no friend of White’s could be other than\r\nhis own enemy. At Blountville, Jonesboro, Greenville, Newport, Lebanon,\r\nand Nashville--every point he touched--he delivered political harangues\r\nin conversations with the friends and admirers who flocked to greet\r\nhim.[923] Thus he employed every method known to electioneering, short\r\nof actually taking the stump.\r\n\r\nThis effort of the President was met by White with a powerful speech at\r\nKnoxville, where a banquet in his honor was arranged for the purpose.\r\n“It is not I who am to be put down and disgraced in this controversy, if\r\nTennessee is either coaxed or coerced to surrender her choice,” he said.\r\n“The Saviour of the World, when upon earth, found among the small number\r\nof His disciples, one Judas, who not only sold but betrayed him for his\r\nthirty pieces of silver. It were vain for one of my humble attainments,\r\nwho has nothing to offer but his best efforts to promote the public\r\nwelfare, to hope that all who professed to be his friends must continue\r\nto act up to that character. Already have I found more than one Judas,\r\nwho, by parting with their interest in me, have received, or expect to\r\nreceive, more than twice their thirty pieces.”[924] Thus, however tame\r\nthe campaign elsewhere, it was a hand-to-hand struggle in the\r\nPresident’s own State--and here Jackson was to meet the greatest\r\nhumiliation of his career.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nThe elections in 1836 were not held on the same day in all the States,\r\nand from November 4th, when Pennsylvania and Ohio voted, until November\r\n23d, when the election was held in Rhode Island, the politicians were\r\nkept in suspense, and it was not until the first week in December that\r\nthe Democrats were able to rejoice in the certainty of their victory.\r\nMassachusetts, which then idolized her Webster, gave him her electoral\r\nvote, and stood alone. South Carolina, which had encouraged White to\r\nenter the contest, again sulked, and, going outside the list of avowed\r\ncandidates, gave hers to Senator Willie Mangum, of North Carolina. White\r\ngreatly disappointed the Whigs, who had expected him to get enough votes\r\nin the Southern and Western States to throw the contest into the House\r\nof Representatives, by carrying only Tennessee and Georgia. Harrison\r\nreceived the electoral votes of Delaware, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland,\r\nNew Jersey, Ohio, and Vermont--a total of 73; while Van Buren won\r\nConnecticut, Maine, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island in New England;\r\nAlabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, and\r\nVirginia in the South; Illinois and Michigan in the West; and both the\r\nmost important States in the Union, Pennsylvania and New York. With only\r\n124 electoral votes divided among his four opponents, Van Buren had 170,\r\na majority of 46.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the results the more prescient of the Democratic leaders\r\ncould find ample justification for concern as to the future. The votes\r\nof Georgia, Indiana, New Jersey, Ohio, and Tennessee, which had gone to\r\nJackson four years before, had been lost by Van Buren, and he had gained\r\nonly Connecticut. But the electoral vote does not indicate the full\r\nextent of the Democratic slump. The popular vote in some of the States\r\nhe had carried had fallen off woefully from the previous election. The\r\nDemocratic majority in Virginia had decreased from 22,158 to 6893; in\r\nIllinois from 8718 to 3114; in North Carolina from 20,299 to 3284. As\r\ncompared with Jackson’s popular majority of 157,293 in 1832, Van Buren\r\nwon only on a popular majority of 24,893 out of a total of 1,498,205\r\nvotes cast. In his own State of New York, however, he increased\r\nJackson’s popular majority of 13,601 in 1832 to 32,272.\r\n\r\nIn White House circles there were some painfully humiliating features in\r\nthe results, and to none more than to Jackson. The people of Tennessee\r\ngave White a majority of 10,000, and even in the President’s own\r\nprecinct, White received 43 votes to 18 for Van Buren. In Georgia, the\r\nhome of the President’s Secretary of State, John Forsyth, the people\r\nturned from the candidate of the Georgian, who was so intimately\r\nidentified with Van Buren’s political fortunes that he was to be\r\nretained at the head of the Cabinet through the new Administration, to\r\ngive their vote to White. In Tennessee, the result was not unnatural.\r\nThe President overestimated his strength in assuming that he could\r\npersuade the people to reject their neighbor and fellow citizen, who had\r\nserved them well, for a New York politician. In Georgia the turnover was\r\npolitical, due to the ascendancy of the radical State-Rights party, and\r\nthe strength of the Nullifying element which Forsyth had courageously\r\nfought.\r\n\r\nThe result of the congressional elections even more impressively\r\nindicated the drift away from the Jacksonian policies. The Democratic\r\nmajority in the House during the Twenty-Fourth Congress, of 46, was\r\nreduced in the next Congress to a plurality of 2 over the Whigs, with 10\r\nindependent members holding the balance of power. Whether this was due\r\nto a reaction against the Democratic Party, or merely measured the loss\r\nof the personal prestige of Jackson as the candidate, was the problem\r\nthat gave concern to the Democracy. If Van Buren looked forward with any\r\nmisgivings to his Administration, however, he gave no sign; and\r\nJackson, if chagrined over his loss of Tennessee, was masterful in\r\ndissimulation. There was as much jubilation in the Democratic camp as\r\nthough the victory had been as decisive as that of four years before.\r\nWhen the electoral votes were being counted, Clay turned to Van Buren\r\nwith the observation: “It is a cloudy day, sir.” “The sun will shine,”\r\nreplied the smiling Red Fox, “on the 4th of March, sir.”[925]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTWILIGHT TRIUMPHS\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nJackson returned to the White House after the election in a serious\r\nphysical condition. The exertions of the hot summer, the long and\r\nwearisome journey, the keen disappointment over the loss of Tennessee,\r\nand his humiliation over his defeat in the Hermitage precinct, had\r\ngreatly weakened the old lion. The return journey to the capital had\r\nincreased his debility, and soon after reaching the White House he was\r\ndriven to his bed by a hemorrhage of the lungs. Ill almost to death, no\r\nword of sympathy reached him from his foes, and from his bed he grimly\r\ndirected and encouraged the counter-attacks with the spirit of the\r\nJackson of New Orleans. In his final Message to Congress, he paid\r\ntribute to the fidelity and integrity of his subordinates, and in\r\nordinary times this would have been permitted to pass unchallenged in\r\nview of his early relinquishment of power. But the times were not\r\nordinary. The last short session was to be one of extraordinary\r\nbitterness, with personal altercations commonplace, and with statesmen\r\nof prominence toying all too lightly with their pistols.\r\n\r\nThus the tribute to the subordinates of the Executive departments was\r\neagerly seized upon by Henry A. Wise, the brilliant and impassioned\r\nyoung Whig of Virginia, as a pretext for a bitter personal attack--one\r\nof the most severe, satiric, sarcastic philippics to be found in the\r\nrecords of Congress from the first session to the present hour. The way\r\nwas paved for it through the presentation of a resolution providing for\r\nthe appointment of a special committee to deal with that portion of the\r\nMessage to which Wise took exception. He summoned to his purpose all the\r\naccumulated charges of eight years of rancorous party warfare, marched\r\nthem with a militant swing before the House, and demanded an\r\ninvestigation to determine, on the eve of the stricken President’s\r\ndeparture from public life, whether he had been falsely accused. Had\r\nJackson actually made such claims for his subordinates? he asked. No, he\r\nhad not even written the Message because physically unfit. “It comes to\r\nus and the country reeking with the fumes of the Kitchen Cabinet.”\r\n\r\nThe excited Representatives gathered about the young orator were not\r\nkept long in doubt as to the particular object of his attack. Describing\r\nJackson’s electioneering activities in Tennessee, Wise dropped the veil:\r\n“I am told,” he said, “that they carried him around like a lion for\r\nshow, and made him roar like a lion. They had catechisms prepared for\r\nhim, and the negotiations of the mission were conducted by pre-concerted\r\nquestions and answers. A crowd would collect on the highway, or in the\r\nbar-rooms, and some village politician of the party would inquire, ‘What\r\nthink you, General, of such a man?’ In a loud tone, much too stentorian\r\nfor those lungs which are now lacerated, the answer rang, ‘He is a\r\ntraitor, sir.’ ‘There, there,’ repeated the demagogues in the crowd,\r\n‘did you not hear that?’ ‘What think you of another, General?’ ‘He is a\r\nliar, sir.’ ‘What of another?’ ‘He made a speech for which he paid a\r\nstenographer five dollars.’ And another was ‘on the fence sir, on the\r\nfence.’ ‘But, General, what think you of Mr. [the first time that Reuben\r\nwas ever called ‘Mister’] Reuben M. Whitney?’ ‘There is no just cause of\r\ncomplaint against Mr. Whitney, sir; he is as true a patriot as ever was;\r\nthey are all liars who accuse him of aught of wrong.’”[926] Thus it was\r\nevident from the speech of Wise that the attack was aimed at Whitney,\r\nerroneously described by some historians as a member of the Kitchen\r\nCabinet,[927] but nevertheless entrusted with the public money. Little\r\ncan be said in defense of Jackson’s confidence in this man, who had been\r\nferociously assailed in the House in the preceding spring by Wise and\r\nBalie Peyton, a hot-headed Whig from Tennessee. With the clever support\r\nof the Democrats, the resolution was adopted and Wise was made chairman\r\nof the investigating committee. This investigation, probably intended\r\nmerely as a peg on which to hang partisan harangues against the stricken\r\nPresident, to whose physical condition Wise had made sneering reference,\r\naccomplished nothing.\r\n\r\nBefore the committee had got fairly started, it struck a snag in a\r\npersonal altercation in the committee room between Peyton and Wise on\r\none side, and Whitney on the other, resulting in the refusal of the\r\nlatter to appear again unless assured that members of the committee\r\nwould attend unarmed! The balking witness was thereupon cited for\r\ncontempt and dragged to the bar of the House; and the clever\r\nAdministration leaders quickly grasped the opportunity to divert\r\nattention from the main question to the arrogant, violent methods of the\r\nhot-headed young Whigs in charge. Thus Whitney set himself to the task\r\nof proving that he could not appear before the committee without serious\r\ndanger of assassination. Witnesses to the altercation, on which he based\r\nhis conclusion, were summoned, and a week was consumed in the hearing of\r\nevidence and the cross-examination of witnesses.\r\n\r\nThe incident on which Whitney based his fears is graphically described\r\nin the testimony of John Fairfield, a Representative from Maine.[928]\r\nThe picture painted of the committee room scene is not inspiring.\r\nWhitney had declined to answer a question because of reflections on his\r\nintegrity by Peyton, and it seems that he had gone so far as to scowl at\r\nthe Tennessee Hotspur in explaining his refusal. It was a day when honor\r\nwas a sensitive plant, and Peyton sprang to his feet with a promise to\r\n“take his life upon the spot.” The equally fiery Wise, ever ready for a\r\ncombat, rose to the occasion, and took his position beside his irate\r\ncolleague with the comment that “this damned insolence is intolerable.”\r\nEncouraged by the open sympathy of Wise, the Tennesseean began to\r\nmeditate aloud, as on the stage, on the enormity of the insult, and to\r\nmutter that he would not be insulted “by a damned thief and robber.” His\r\npassion, feeding on his hot meditations, and his excitement growing\r\ngreater, he wheeled upon Whitney, who, alarmed, sprang to his feet and\r\nclaimed the protection of the committee. “Damn you--damn you!” shouted\r\nthe white-faced Peyton, “you shan’t say a word while in this room--if\r\nyou do I will put you to death.” With these words he put his hand to his\r\nbosom and moved toward the object of his fury, and Wise and other\r\nmembers of the committee tried to calm the infuriated statesman. “Don’t,\r\nPeyton,” cried Wise, “damn him, he is not worth your notice.” Somewhat\r\nmollified by this assurance, the insulted Representative sank into his\r\nchair--but his blood still boiled. “Damn him, his eyes are upon me!” he\r\ncried as in a melodrama. “Damn him, he is looking at me--he shan’t do\r\nit!” By this time it was thought possible to calm the nerves of the\r\njumpy Peyton if the witness, whose eyes were so offensive, could be\r\nremoved from the room; and as he passed out, Wise requested the\r\ncommittee to remain seated to prevent an encounter in the corridor.[929]\r\nThus far the impulsive Virginian appeared in the favorable light of a\r\npeace-maker, but, finding pleasure in the narration of the manner in\r\nwhich the hated minion of the Administration had been frightened out of\r\nhis wits, he began to boast that his purpose in getting close to Whitney\r\nhad been to shoot him at the slightest provocation, and he was thus\r\ndrawn into the controversy along with Peyton.\r\n\r\nNothing could have been more pleasing to the political managers of the\r\nAdministration. Before the galleries, packed to hear the eye-witnesses,\r\nthe two Whigs began to appear more and more as quarrelsome,\r\npistol-toting bullies taking advantage of their position to browbeat and\r\nintimidate an unprotected witness. The Democratic press, under the\r\ninspiration of Blair and Kendall, devoted columns to the evidence, and\r\nsentiment was turned against the Whig leaders until they began to\r\ncomplain that they, and not Whitney, were apparently at the bar. “Sir,”\r\nWise declared, “it is I who am on trial and not Reuben M. Whitney. I\r\nhave no doubt of the contrivance to make this issue before the\r\ncountry.... I wish to know, sir, if there are not other officers of the\r\nGovernment who have issued the order that the power of this House, and\r\nthe Executive power of the country, are both to be brought to bear upon\r\ntwo humble and inexperienced members of the House. Sir, I have felt it.”\r\n\r\nThe affair had now worked around to the distinct advantage of the\r\nAdministration, and Wise and Peyton, and not Jackson, were in distress.\r\nThe psychological hour had struck to end the farce. The motion to\r\ndismiss Whitney was made and carried, and when the name of Wise was\r\ncalled, he solemnly rose:\r\n\r\n“Mr. Speaker,” he said, “I shall not vote until I ascertain whether I am\r\ndischarged from prosecution or not.”\r\n\r\nAs the smiling House offered no information, his name is not recorded\r\namong those voting. Thus the one offensive against Jackson, launched by\r\nhis enemies on the eve of his relinquishment of power, ended in a\r\nriproaring farce.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nIn the Senate the offensive was taken by Jackson’s supporters when\r\nBenton served notice that he would demand a vote on his motion to\r\nexpunge the vote of censure from the records. Much water had passed over\r\nthe dam since the persistent Missourian had first offered his\r\nresolution. With the aid of the Kitchen Cabinet, he had made it a\r\nnational issue. The fight had been carried into the States of the\r\nSenators who had voted for the censure, and, in numerous instances, the\r\noffending member had either been defeated for reëlection, or the\r\nlegislature had been prevailed upon to instruct him to vote to expunge.\r\nOne of the opponents of the Benton resolution had died and been\r\nsucceeded by a Jackson sympathizer. Through defeat, or resignations\r\nforced by instructions from legislatures, enemies had given place to\r\nfriends from Connecticut, New Jersey, North Carolina, Illinois,\r\nMississippi, and Virginia. New Senators, friends of Jackson, had entered\r\nfrom the new States of Arkansas and Michigan. A private poll convinced\r\nBenton that the triumph was at hand, all the sweeter because coming on\r\nthe eve of Jackson’s retirement. The day after Christmas he reintroduced\r\nhis original resolution, and on January 12th supported it in a speech\r\nlaudatory of Jackson--a pæan of anticipated triumph. The old man, always\r\na trifle pompous and stilted in his style, was never more so, but in his\r\nmost extravagant praise he unquestionably spoke the language of his\r\nheart. Beginning by recalling the discouraging circumstances under which\r\nhe first offered his resolution, he gloatingly declared that the\r\nOpposition had become “more and more odious to the public mind and\r\nmusters now but a slender phalanx of friends.” The people had been\r\npassing on the censure; had passed upon it in the triumph of Van Buren,\r\nwho had publicly proclaimed his adherence to the plans of Benton. He\r\nwould not rehash the constitutional arguments. The debate had ended and\r\nthe verdict had been rendered, but the occasion called for some\r\nreference to the achievements and triumphs of the Administration. Then\r\nhe hastily sketched its battles, claiming in the aftermath of each the\r\nvindication of events--the destruction of the Bank, the removal of the\r\ndeposits, the triumphant termination of the controversy with the\r\nFrench.\r\n\r\n“And now, sir,” he concluded, as we may imagine with his chest thrown\r\nout, “I finish the task which, three years ago, I imposed upon myself.\r\nSolitary and alone, and amidst the taunts and jeers of my opponents, I\r\nput this ball in motion. The people have taken it up and rolled it\r\nforward, and I am no longer anything but a unit in the vast mass which\r\nnow propels it. In the name of that mass, I speak. I demand the\r\nexecution of the edict of the people; I demand the expurgation of that\r\nsentence which the voice of a few Senators and the power of their\r\nconfederate, the Bank of the United States, has caused to be placed upon\r\nthe journal of the Senate, and which the voice of millions of freemen\r\nhas ordered to be expunged from it.”\r\n\r\nThus spoke the champion of Jackson in the tones and manner of a\r\nconqueror. As he resumed his seat, John J. Crittenden of Kentucky rose\r\nto protest against the “party desecration” of the record, and after a\r\nfew words from Senator Dana, who favored the expunging record, the\r\nSenate adjourned. On the following day some of the great orators of the\r\nOpposition were put forward to oppose the resolution.\r\n\r\nWe are told by an eye-witness that the eloquent Preston “spoke in a\r\nstrain of eloquence inspired by his feelings of great aversion.”[930] If\r\nBenton was theatrical, as has been justly charged by historians, the\r\nWhigs were even more so, as we shall see. Beginning with great\r\nsolemnity, and describing his shock and sorrow, Preston proceeded:\r\n\r\n“Execution is demanded--aye, sir, the executioners are here with ready\r\nhands. Exercise your function, gentlemen.... The axe is in your\r\nhand--perform that which is so loudly called for. Execution, sir, of\r\nwhat, of whom? Is the axe aimed at men who voted for the resolution you\r\nare about to expunge? Is it us you strike at? If so, ... in God’s name\r\nlet the blow come, and as the fatal edge fell upon my neck, I would\r\ndeclare with honest sincerity that I would rather be the criminal of\r\n1834 than the executioner of 1837.” More: the names of the Senators\r\nrefusing to expunge would in the future “be familiar as household words”\r\nand be “taught to children as the names of Washington and Adams and\r\nHancock and Lee and Lafayette are now taught to our children.”\r\n\r\nA moment later the orator’s pensive melancholy had turned to rage.\r\n\r\n“Why not expunge those who made the record?” he thundered, forgetting\r\nhow many had been “expunged.” “If the proceedings had a guilt so\r\nmonstrous as to render necessary this novel and extraordinary course,\r\nthe men themselves who perpetrated the deed--it is they who should be\r\nexpunged. Men who entered so foul a page upon the journal cannot be\r\nworthy of a seat here. Remove us! Turn us out! Expel us from the Senate!\r\nWould to God you could! Call in the pretorian guard! Take us--apprehend\r\nus--march us off!”[931]\r\n\r\nAfter Rives and Niles had spoken in support of the resolution, Calhoun\r\nmournfully rose, and with funereal sadness, not unmixed with scorn,\r\npointed out the resemblance of the proceedings to the degenerate days of\r\nRome. “But why do I waste my breath?” he asked, in conclusion. “I know\r\nit is all utterly vain. The day is gone; night approaches, and night is\r\nsuitable to the dark deed we meditate. There is a sort of destiny in\r\nthis thing. The act must be performed; and it is an act that will tell\r\non the political history of this country forever.... It is a melancholy\r\nevidence of a broken spirit, ready to bow at the feet of power. The\r\nformer act[932] was such a one as might have been perpetrated in the\r\ndays of Pompey and Cæsar; but an act like this could never have been\r\nconsummated by a Roman Senate until the times of Caligula and Nero.”\r\n\r\nAfter Calhoun concluded, unsuccessful efforts to adjourn were made,\r\nuntil Clay announced his intention to speak at length, and his request\r\nfor delay was granted. Had his supporters realized how far from absolute\r\ncertainty of success Benton felt, they would have favored, instead of\r\nfought, an adjournment. The following day was Saturday, and a careful\r\npoll disclosed the disconcerting diversity of opinion as to details\r\nwhich threatened the success of the project, and Benton gladly agreed to\r\na postponement of the discussion until Monday. That night the then\r\nfamous restaurant of Boulanger found all the Jacksonian Senators seated\r\nabout the banquet board. The clever host had loaded the table with his\r\nchoicest offerings, and as soon as the statesmen had reached the mellow,\r\naccommodating mood, they settled down to the real purpose of the feast.\r\nRealizing that he lacked the deftness and finesse required for ironing\r\nout all differences as to details, Benton had assigned the work of\r\nconciliation to Silas Wright, Allen of Ohio, and Linn of Missouri. Even\r\nso, it “required all the moderation, tact, and skill of the prime movers\r\nto obtain and maintain the union upon details, on the success of which\r\nthe measure depended.”[933] But when, at midnight, the Senators\r\ndispersed, all conflicting views had been reconciled, and for the first\r\ntime an actual majority was pledged to a single programme. It was\r\ndecided to call the resolution up on Monday, and to keep it constantly\r\nbefore the Senate, without adjournment, until the “deed” was done.\r\n\r\nTo prevent any of his flock from wandering afield in search of\r\nrefreshments, Benton had made ample preparations, and a tourist,\r\nwandering into Benton’s committee room at four o’clock on Monday\r\nafternoon, would have assumed, in view of the vast quantities of cold\r\nham, turkey, rounds of beef, pickles, wines, and coffee, that he had\r\nstumbled into a senatorial café. That day, Clay appeared in the Senate\r\nostentatiously garbed in black as though in mourning for the murdered\r\nConstitution. So ugly was his mood that he even refused snuff offered\r\nby a Democratic Senator he knew was going to vote to expunge. The\r\ngalleries were packed to witness the drama, or melodrama, and\r\nimpatiently sat through the preliminary work of the Senate. At length\r\nthe hour came for the consideration of the resolution, and all eyes\r\nturned to Clay, who thoroughly enjoyed his rôle in the play. As his tall\r\nform slowly rose, there was a rustling in the galleries as the\r\nspectators shifted their position to get a better view of the great\r\nenemy of Jackson. On his feet, he stood a moment in silence, as though\r\nweighed down by the importance of his task, if not by its hopelessness.\r\nThen he began in subdued tones, albeit his silvery voice was heard\r\ndistinctly over the chamber. Such a hardened observer of historical\r\nincidents as Sargent describes the scene as “grand, impressive, and\r\nimposing,” and “even solemn,” as though “some terrible rite was to be\r\nperformed, some bloody sacrifice to be made upon the altar of\r\nMoloch.”[934]\r\n\r\n“What object?” he demanded. Was it necessary because of the President?\r\n“In one hand,” he continued, “he holds the purse, and in the other he\r\nbrandishes the sword of the country. Myriads of dependents and\r\npartisans, scattered all over the land, are ever ready to sing hosannas\r\nto him, and to laud to the skies whatever he does. He has swept over the\r\nGovernment during the last eight years like a tropical tornado. Every\r\ndepartment exhibits traces of the ravages of the storm.... What object\r\nof his ambition is unsatisfied? When, disabled from age any longer to\r\nhold the scepter of power, he designates his successor, and transmits it\r\nto his favorite, what more does he want? Must we blot, deface, and\r\nmutilate the records of the country, to punish the presumptuousness of\r\nexpressing any opinion contrary to his own?\r\n\r\n“What object?” demanded Clay. “Do you intend to thrust your hands into\r\nour hearts and pluck out the deeply rooted convictions which are there?\r\nOr is it your design merely to stigmatize us? Standing securely upon\r\nour conscious rectitude, and bearing aloft the Constitution of our\r\ncountry, your puny efforts are impotent; and we defy all your power.\r\n\r\n“What object?” reiterated the orator. “To please the President? He would\r\nreject, with scorn and contempt as unworthy of his fame, your black\r\nscratches and your baby lines in the fair records of his country. Black\r\nlines. Black lines.... And hereafter, when we shall lose the forms of\r\nour free institutions, all that now remain to us, some future American\r\nmonarch, in gratitude to those by whose means he has been enabled, upon\r\nthe ruins of civil liberty, to erect a throne, and to commemorate\r\nespecially this expunging resolution, may institute a new order of\r\nknighthood, and confer on it the appropriate name of the ‘Knights of the\r\nBlack Lines.’”\r\n\r\nBut why continue, he inquired, as he closed his fierce philippic.\r\n“Proceed then with your noble work.... And when you have perpetrated it,\r\ngo home to the people, and tell them what glorious honors you have\r\nachieved for our common country. Tell them that you have extinguished\r\none of the brightest and purest lights that ever burned on the altar of\r\ncivil liberty. Tell them that you have silenced one of the noblest\r\nbatteries that ever thundered in defense of the Constitution, and\r\nbravely spiked the cannon. Tell them that henceforth, no matter what\r\ndaring or outrageous act any President may perform, you have forever\r\nhermetically sealed the mouth of the Senate. Tell them that he may\r\nfearlessly assume what powers he pleases, snatch from its lawful custody\r\nthe public purse, and command a military detachment to enter the halls\r\nof the Capitol, overawe Congress, trample down the Constitution, and\r\nraze every bulwark of freedom; but that the Senate must stand mute, in\r\nsilent submission, and not dare to raise its opposing voice.”\r\n\r\nSuch the theatrical strain of a speech which the schoolboys of\r\nwell-regulated Whig families were to declaim for the delight of their\r\nelders for a generation, and to call forth a fulsome note from the\r\nsober-minded Kent.\r\n\r\nAs Clay sat down, James Buchanan rose to reply, admitting that it was\r\nthe part of prudence to remain silent after the Whig orator had\r\n“enchanted the attention of his audience.” Fluent, logical, if not\r\neloquent, he followed Clay’s speech point by point, rehashing with him\r\nthe Bank controversy--leading up to the removal of the deposits and the\r\nvote of censure--defending Jackson at every step. If Jackson’s act was\r\none of tyranny, unconstitutional, aimed at civil liberty, why, he\r\ndemanded, “had the Whigs merely censured him without giving him the\r\nopportunity to reply? Why had they not done their duty and instituted\r\nimpeachment proceedings? True, they insisted that they had not imputed\r\nany criminal motive to the President--”\r\n\r\nClay was instantly on his feet, hotly insisting that “personally he had\r\nnever acquitted the President of improper intentions.” To which the\r\ncourtly Buchanan replied with a compliment to the Kentuckian’s “frank\r\nand manly nature,” and passed on.\r\n\r\nThe Whigs now attempted to adjourn, but Benton’s drilled forces were on\r\nhand to vote down Bayard’s motion, and the debate proceeded. Other\r\nspeakers followed, men of lesser light, while the Senators themselves,\r\nsatiated with the arguments, began to pass out in twos and threes to\r\nregale and refresh themselves in Benton’s room. Such of the Whigs as\r\nwere not too bitter were cordially invited to partake of the feast, and\r\nsome accepted. Clay sent some of his friends to the committee room to\r\nascertain the nature of the attraction, and the emissaries lingered too\r\nlong over the meat, and especially the drink, and he became furious.\r\nWith the coming of night the curious packed the corridors and lobbies,\r\nand the great chandelier which lighted the little chamber shed its glow\r\non the gay dresses of the ladies of fashion, many of whom had been\r\nadmitted to the floor.\r\n\r\nAs the hour grew late, and there was a pause in the debate, the eyes of\r\nall were fixed on Webster, who sat gloomily in his seat. He glanced\r\naround to see if others proposed to speak, then rose to make the final\r\nprotest. An eye-witness tells us that “his dark visage assumed a darker\r\nhue”; that “his deep-toned voice seemed almost sepulchral.”[935] As was\r\nhis custom, he spoke with more moderation than Clay, Calhoun, or\r\nPreston, and was all the more impressive on that account. He refrained\r\nfrom hysterical denunciations, and from comparisons with the degenerate\r\ndays of Rome. “But,” he said, “we make up our minds to behold the\r\nspectacle which is to ensue. We collect ourselves to look on in silence\r\nwhile a scene is exhibited which, if we do not regard it as a ruthless\r\nviolation of a sacred instrument, would appear to us to be but little\r\nelevated above the character of a contemptible farce. This scene we\r\nshall behold, and hundreds of American citizens--as many as may crowd\r\ninto these lobbies and galleries--will behold it also--with what\r\nfeelings I do not undertake to say.”\r\n\r\nReiterating, then, his protest, he concluded: “Having made this protest,\r\nour duty is performed. We rescue our own names, characters, and honor\r\nfrom all participation in this matter; and whatever the wayward\r\ncharacter of the times, the headlong and plunging spirit of party\r\ndevotion, or the fear or the love of power, may have been able to bring\r\nabout elsewhere, we desire to thank God that we have not, as yet,\r\novercome the love of liberty, fidelity to true republican principles,\r\nand a sacred regard for the Constitution, in that State whose soil was\r\ndrenched to a mire by the first and best blood of the Revolution.”\r\n\r\nWhile Webster was speaking, two Whig Senators, realizing that the\r\ncontest had degenerated into a trial of nerves and muscle, went to\r\nBenton with the suggestion that nothing could be gained by delaying the\r\nvote.[936] When no one rose to continue the argument at the conclusion,\r\nthere was a moment of silence and then the cry of “Question” rose. The\r\nroll was called, with forty-three Senators in their seats, five absent,\r\nand the resolution was passed by a vote of 24 to 19.\r\n\r\nBenton instantly demanded the execution of the order of the Senate.\r\nWhile the clerk was out to get the original journal, Benton, in perfect\r\necstasy, ostentatiously congratulated persons in the lower gallery,\r\nuntil the glowering countenance of Balie Peyton warned him of a possible\r\nexplosion.[937] But the Tennessee firebrand was not the only person in\r\nthe gallery, or, for that matter, on the floor, with a deadly hate of\r\nBenton in the heart. The galleries remained true to the Bank and Biddle,\r\nand some of the Senators, having freely indulged themselves, were in a\r\nquarrelsome mood. Fear was entertained for Benton’s life by some of his\r\nfriends, including his wife. Just previous to the vote, Senator Linn had\r\nbrought in pistols for the defense, if required, and Mrs. Benton,\r\nseriously alarmed, took her place by her husband’s side on the floor. As\r\nthe clerk returned with the record, the defeated statesmen, pretending\r\nto a patriotism that could not look upon the “deed,” filed out of the\r\nchamber--all but Hugh Lawson White who never deserted his post. As the\r\nPresident _pro tem_ announced that the “deed” was done, the hitherto\r\nsullen and silent gallery broke into groans, hisses, imprecations.\r\nEnraged and excited, Benton sprang to his feet with the demand that the\r\n“ruffians” that caused the disturbance be apprehended and brought to the\r\nbar. “I hope the sergeant-at-arms will be directed to enter the gallery,\r\nand seize the ruffians.... Let him seize the Bank ruffians. I hope they\r\nwill not be suffered to insult the Senate as they did when it was under\r\nthe power of the Bank of the United States when ruffians, with arms upon\r\nthem, insulted us with impunity.... Here is one just above me that may\r\neasily be identified--the Bank ruffians!”\r\n\r\nThus the ringleader was dragged to the bar. But here was a diversion\r\nthat had not entered into the agreement as to details at Boulanger’s on\r\nSaturday night, and the wrangle that followed ended in the discharge of\r\nthe culprit from custody. As the vote to discharge was announced, the\r\nperson in custody demanded to be heard. “Begone!” cried King, in the\r\nchair--and the incident was closed. But Benton’s blood was hot, and on\r\nleaving the Capitol he encountered Clay, whom he suspected of having\r\ninstigated the gallery disturbance, and a bitter altercation resulted.\r\nBut after the two men, personally not unfriendly and related by\r\nmarriage, had exercised their vituperative vocabulary, Benton insisted\r\non seeing Clay home, and did not leave until three in the morning when\r\nClay had sought his couch. Thus ended a dramatic episode--so dramatic\r\nand historic that on the following morning Webster requested Henry A.\r\nWise to prepare a description which was afterwards given in an address\r\nat Norfolk.[938]\r\n\r\nThe triumph, we may be sure, was sweet to the stricken veteran in the\r\nWhite House. Within a week he invited all his senatorial friends and\r\ntheir wives to an elaborate dinner. Hovering on the verge of the grave,\r\nhe dragged himself from his bed to greet his guests, accompanied them to\r\nthe dining-room, seated Benton in his place at the head of the table,\r\nand retired to his couch, while the celebration below continued until a\r\nlate hour.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThe last days of Jackson in the White House could not have been other\r\nthan days of joyous thanksgiving. Entering the White House the most\r\npopular of all Americans, eight years of the most bitter controversies\r\nin the Nation’s history had only tended to strengthen the affections of\r\nthe people. Through the greater part of his Presidency he had been\r\nconstantly harassed by a hostile Senate, and his enemies had been\r\ndefeated or otherwise retired, until now both branches of the Congress\r\nwere devoted to his policies. His most powerful enemies had been\r\nhumiliated. The prize of the Presidency dangling before Calhoun in the\r\nbeginning was now forever beyond his reach. Clay had been defeated in\r\nhis ambition and shamefully set aside by his ungrateful party. The man\r\nof his own choice had been elected to succeed him, and the hated censure\r\nof the Senate had been expunged by the order of the people. Few\r\nPresidents have ever departed from the scene of their power with more\r\nfor which to be grateful and less to regret.\r\n\r\nBut the old man had run his race and been surfeited with the sweets of\r\npersonal triumphs, and was eager to return to the calm of his beloved\r\nHermitage, among his old and cherished friends and faithful slaves, and\r\nnear to the tomb of his idolized Rachel. By sheer will power he had\r\nfought back the specter which had hovered by his sick-bed, to this end.\r\nConfined to his room most of the time, debilitated by age and disease,\r\nthe old man’s mind was not free from anxieties for the future of his\r\ncountry. He knew too well the temper of public men, and comprehended too\r\nkeenly the delicate problems pressing for solution, not to know that\r\nthere were dangers ahead. It was his desire to give some parting advice\r\nto the people in his final Message, but he was persuaded to convey his\r\nlast word in the form of a “Farewell,” like Washington. To the\r\npreparation of this paper he devoted much time and thought during the\r\nlast two months, and, while he had the assistance of Roger B. Taney in\r\nthe phrasing of his thoughts, all the ideas, and much of the language,\r\noriginated with him. Strangely enough, the “Farewell” of Jackson is\r\nscarcely known, and some historians are prone to smile upon it as an\r\nunworthy imitation of the Washington paper. It was nothing of the sort.\r\nIt smacks, in large part, of prophecy. The man who wrote it saw, in\r\nfancy, the swaying columns of the blue and gray, and he strove to avert\r\nthe clash. The old hero of the Nullification fight, feeble and sick,\r\nbending over his desk in the White House of 1837, was writing and\r\npleading in the spirit of the Lincoln of 1861 as he wrote his touching\r\ninaugural appeal for peace.[939] Having finished his “Farewell,” to be\r\ngiven out on the day of leaving office, the old man impatiently awaited\r\nhis release. His friends, he knew, would not suffer by the change. The\r\nJackson Cabinet was to be continued, with the exception of Cass, who was\r\nto be sent to France, thus making way for Joel Poinsett, who had been\r\nJackson’s right hand in the Nullification struggle.\r\n\r\nOn Washington’s birthday he received the public in a farewell reception,\r\nfamous because of the mammoth cheese donated by admirers, greater in\r\ncircumference than a hogs-head. Two men with knives made from saw blades\r\ncut into the enormous mass, giving each guest a piece weighing from two\r\nto three pounds. Some, who had provided themselves with paper, wrapped\r\ntheir portion and bore it away as a souvenir; others, not so thoughtful,\r\ncarried theirs in their hands. Much of it crumbled in the hands of the\r\nbearers and was trampled on the floor. It was Jackson’s farewell, and\r\nthousands pushed their way into the White House, and, after getting\r\ntheir portion of the cheese, pressed on into the Blue Room, where the\r\nPresident, much too feeble to stand, received and greeted his visitors\r\nfrom his chair. Beside him stood the cordial Mrs. Donelson, while just\r\nbehind him Martin Van Buren greeted all with a smile and a courtly\r\nbow.[940]\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nThe Jackson of the White House would have commanded attention in any\r\nassembly, even to the last. More than six feet in height and slender to\r\nattenuation, his limbs long and straight, and his shoulders slightly\r\nstooped, he carried himself proudly, and not without grace. His white\r\nhair stood erect, giving a full view of a forehead that indicated\r\nintellectual power. His eyes, deep-set, clear but small, were blue in\r\ncolor and noticeably penetrating, and the great spectacles he wore\r\naccentuated their boring quality. These eyes, flashing with the\r\nfierceness of the fight, could easily melt, in tenderness, to tears. His\r\nstrong cheek-bones and lantern jaws denoted the warrior. His strongly\r\nchiseled chin and firm mouth told of his inflexibility. His chest was\r\nflat, and indicated his most pronounced physical weakness. Seen upon his\r\nwalks about Washington, wearing his high white beaver hat, with his\r\nwidower’s weed, and carrying a stout cane adorned with a silken tassel,\r\nhe looked the part of the patriarch who could either bestow a\r\nbenediction or a blow. Throughout his two terms his health was wretched,\r\nand time and again, stricken with disease, his death had seemed only a\r\nmatter of days, but the iron will prevailed over the failing flesh. His\r\nhair grew whiter. The lines in his face deepened. His step lost some of\r\nits spring. He was forced to abandon his long walks and the pleasures of\r\nthe saddle, and remain more and more in the White House. But the eye\r\nretained its fire, his voice its fervor, and his spirit never flagged.\r\nIn moments of relaxation, toward the close, there was a softened\r\nexpression, but in his fighting moments he differed little from the grim\r\nold man who entered the mansion of the Presidents as Adams took his\r\ndeparture.\r\n\r\nThe libels of his enemies of the Whig aristocracy notwithstanding, he\r\nhad not been unworthy, socially, of the stately traditions of his\r\nenvironment, and had impressed all visitors with his fine courtesy,\r\ncourtliness, ability, and graciousness.[941] Never before or afterwards\r\nwere there such incongruous crowds at the receptions, but this\r\ndisclosed less the taste of the master of the Mansion than his political\r\nprinciples; and his dinners in tone and taste commanded the admiration\r\nof his enemies.[942] These receptions and dinners had drawn heavily on\r\nhis resources, and toward the close left him seriously embarrassed. He\r\nhimself could have lived on monastic fare. A weak stomach forced him to\r\neat sparingly, and he often dined on bread, milk, and vegetables; but\r\nthere were always guests at the table, which was invariably ladened as\r\nfor a feast.[943]\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was not without regret that he passed through the rooms of\r\nthe historic house in those last days, for he had converted the White\r\nHouse into a home, and it was rich in memories of the sort that tug at\r\nthe heart. Fond of his family, and especially of the young women\r\nmembers, this “home” had been the scene of several marriages and\r\nchristenings. The beautiful Emily Donelson, the wife of his secretary\r\nand niece, the mistress of the mansion, had presided with grace and\r\ndignity and brightened the days and nights. In a physical sense she was\r\nan exquisite woman, of medium height, her figure slender and\r\nsymmetrical, her hands and feet as tiny as a child’s. Her hair and eyes\r\nwere a dark brown, her lips beautifully moulded, her complexion fair.\r\nMany found in her a striking resemblance to Mary, Queen of Scots, as she\r\nappears in her pictures. Her taste in dress was beyond reproach, and\r\nsoon after entering the White House her toilette was “the envy and\r\nadmiration of the fashionable circles.”[944] Her judgment in social\r\nmatters was infallible, and Jackson depended upon her advice. “You know\r\nbest, my dear, do as you please,” was his only suggestion when delicate\r\nproblems were submitted to him. Fond of society, vivacious, dignified,\r\nand always gracious, she not only commanded admiration, but affection.\r\nAn excellent conversationalist, she possessed the art, so seldom found\r\nin good talkers, of being an ingratiating listener. In contact with the\r\nbrightest minds of the capital, she lost nothing by the comparison.\r\n“Madame, you dance with the grace of a Parisian,” remarked a\r\ncondescending foreign minister. “I can hardly realize that you were born\r\nin Tennessee.” “Count,” she retorted, “you forget that grace is a\r\ncosmopolite, and, like a wild flower, is much oftener found in the woods\r\nthan in the streets of a city.” During her days in the White House her\r\nfour children were born, and Jackson, who was delighted to have\r\nchildhood about him, took a keen interest in their christenings. He was\r\ngodfather for two, Van Buren for one, and Polk--all Presidents--for the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nAnother of the White House women was Sarah Yorke Jackson, daughter of\r\nPeter Yorke, of Philadelphia, and wife of another nephew. She was much\r\nyounger than Mrs. Donelson, having been married but a short time before\r\nthe inauguration, but Jackson, fearing some misunderstanding as to\r\nprecedence, called them together and announced his will. “You, my dear,”\r\nhe said to Mrs. Jackson, “are mistress of the Hermitage, and Emily is\r\nhostess of the White House.” The arrangement was satisfactory to both,\r\nand no misunderstandings marred their relations. Mrs. Jackson was\r\nhappily indifferent to social prestige, but in the spirit of helpfulness\r\ndid her part. Highly accomplished and beautiful, graceful, and possessed\r\nof wonderful poise in one so young, she was intensely devoted to\r\nJackson, and the old man reciprocated the affection in full measure.\r\n\r\nUsually, in the evening, Jackson gathered his family about him, and if\r\nSenators, diplomats, or Cabinet Ministers appeared, they were drawn into\r\nthe family circle. If the business which brought them happened to be of\r\nimportance, he would, perhaps, draw them into a distant part of the\r\nsimply furnished parlor which was lighted from above by a chandelier.\r\nIn the winter the fire blazed in the grate, and, arranging their chairs\r\nabout the fireplace, the women applied themselves to their sewing while\r\ngossiping of the events of the day. Here would be found Mrs. Jackson and\r\nMrs. Donelson, perhaps Mrs. Livingston, possibly Mrs. McLane, or some\r\nother woman of the White House circle. Playing about the room would be\r\nfive or six children in irreverent disregard of the old man in the long\r\nloose coat, seated in an armchair, smoking his long reed-stem pipe with\r\na red clay bowl. Mayhap Livingston or Van Buren or Forsyth would be\r\nreading him an important dispatch from a foreign minister, while the\r\nchildren, with their shouts and screams, would all but drown the voice\r\nof the visitor. Nothing disturbed by the clamor, the old man would bend\r\nforward and listen more intently. Perhaps he would wave his long-stemmed\r\npipe toward the rowdies, with an apologetic smile. But never a cross\r\nword.\r\n\r\nThe hour for retirement would come. The children would withdraw and be\r\ntucked in their beds. The President would go to his room. There he would\r\nsit awhile at the table, and, by the light of a single candle, would\r\nread a chapter from the Bible that had belonged to Rachel, and then gaze\r\nawhile at her picture propped up before him. The light would be snuffed.\r\nThe old man would retire, and the negro bodyguard would lie down on the\r\nfloor and join his master in sleep. Suddenly a child’s cry would\r\npenetrate the President’s chamber, and he would awaken--and listen. Then\r\nhe would get up, go to the room of the little one, and, brushing\r\nobjections aside, take it in his arms and walk the floor with it until\r\nit slept. This was not an unusual occurrence.[945]\r\n\r\nAfter breakfasting in the morning, Jackson would go to his office, on\r\nthe second floor, and, lighting his pipe, would settle down to the\r\nroutine work of the day. Bookshelves lined the room. Busts of the\r\nPresident, the work of various sculptors, and a number of portraits,\r\nall by Earle, looked upon the original from shelves and tables. There\r\nflocked the politicians, Lewis with a report, Blair with a leader,\r\nKendall with a programme. There he planned and fought his battles with\r\nthe politicians, but when evening came he looked forward to the joys of\r\ndomesticity, or the diversions of the company of women upon whom he\r\nlooked “with the most romantic, pure, and poetic devotion.”[946] The\r\naccomplished Mrs. Livingston would enliven him with her vivacious\r\nconversation on all manner of topics, her daughter Cora would delight\r\nhim with her animation and wit, and his eyes would fill when Mrs. Philip\r\nHamilton, daughter of McLane, responded to his never-failing invitation\r\nto play and sing his favorite song from Burns. Mrs. McLane, an\r\nattractive and entertaining chatterbox, with interested motives for\r\nattempting to fascinate the old warrior, was always a welcome diversion,\r\nand Mrs. Rives, the stately wife of the Virginia Senator; Mrs. Macomb,\r\nwife of the General; and Sallie Coles Stevenson, who resembled Mrs.\r\nLivingston in intelligence and tact, were frequent guests. These had\r\ngiven to the White House something of the charm of the Hermitage; but at\r\ntimes, in the bitterness of the continual struggle, when the old man\r\ngrew weary of the bauble of power, and felt his faith in mankind\r\nslipping, and homesickness for the Hermitage possessing him, he had\r\noften laid aside the cares of state, turned his back upon the scene of\r\nhis struggle and the house of his triumphs, and walked across the Avenue\r\nto the home of the Blairs, where he knew he could find a haven of rest.\r\nThere he knew he could appear, not as the head of the State, but as\r\nAndrew Jackson of the Hermitage. It became his second home. There he\r\ncould forget his enemies, and, in the homey atmosphere of a house\r\npervaded by the personality of a sincere and unaffected woman, he could\r\nrevive his fainting spirits.\r\n\r\nBut he was surfeited with triumphs, and the Hermitage called him home\r\nto the tomb of Rachel. The twilight was closing in upon him. He knew it\r\nwas time to go.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nThe dawn of inauguration day found him so ill and debilitated that he\r\nshould have remained in bed, but the soldier spirit of the man refused\r\nto yield to the promptings of the flesh. He was up early, doing his full\r\npart. The day was ideal--as Van Buren had promised Clay. The clear sky,\r\nthe bright, cheery sunshine, the balmy air could not have been better\r\nordered for the distinguished invalid. A great throng stretched back\r\nfrom the east front of the Capitol to witness the historic scene, and\r\nthe eastern windows were packed with the more favored spectators. It was\r\nplainly to be seen from the attitude of the multitude that the real\r\nreverence and enthusiasm was for the leader whose race was run, rather\r\nthan for his successor. “For once,” observed Benton, “the rising was\r\neclipsed by the setting sun.” The old man, feeble and bowed, sat\r\nlistening to the inaugural address of the man he had elevated to the\r\nhighest office in the world. Van Buren concluded. Jackson rose and began\r\nslowly to descend the steps of the portico to his carriage which was\r\nwaiting to convey him back to the White House. At that moment, the\r\npent-up feelings of the crowd burst forth in cheers and acclamations.\r\n“It was the acclaim of posterity breaking from the bosom of\r\ncontemporaries,” wrote Benton. The old man, deeply touched to tenderness\r\nand humility, acknowledged his appreciation by mute signs. From one of\r\nthe upper windows a rough fighting man witnessed the scene with an\r\nemotion he had never felt before. From thence, Benton looked down upon\r\nthe close of a memorable “reign,” of which he was to become the\r\nhistorian as he had been its defender.\r\n\r\nThat night Jackson slept as usual in the White House as the guest of\r\nPresident Van Buren, who insisted that he remain in his old quarters\r\nuntil in May or June the trip back to the Hermitage could be made in\r\ngreater comfort, but the journey held no terrors for the homesick\r\nstatesman. The following afternoon he walked across the Avenue to the\r\nhome of Frank Blair for a final visit with the family within whose bosom\r\nhe had passed many joyous hours during the eight years of storm and\r\nstress. A little later, Benton called with William Allen, then Senator\r\nfrom Ohio, and for many years the world knew nothing of the nature of\r\nthat final conference. Benton himself was mysteriously silent, nor did\r\nhe furnish any enlightenment in his great history of the “Thirty Years.”\r\nBut long after most of the participants in the politics of that day were\r\nmouldering in the grave, Blair and Allen told the story to one of the\r\nPresident’s biographers. Jackson talked, and the others listened. He\r\ntold them of his two principal regrets--that he had never had an\r\nopportunity to shoot Clay or to hang Calhoun. He had no regrets because\r\nof his crushing of the Bank, nor because of his encouragement of the\r\nspoils system. But he left office feeling that his work would have been\r\nmore nearly completed if Texas had been annexed and the Oregon boundary\r\ndispute had been settled at fifty-four-forty. To his loyal supporters he\r\nleft one admonition that afternoon:\r\n\r\n“Of all things, never once take your eyes off Texas, and never let go of\r\nfifty-four-forty.”\r\n\r\nThe following day witnessed his departure. He took with him the picture\r\nof Rachel which had been upon his desk through his eight years of trial,\r\nher Bible, to which he had been devoted, her protégé Earle, the artist,\r\nwho was to remain with him at the Hermitage, and to be buried in its\r\npeaceful shade.\r\n\r\nThus ended the reign of Andrew Jackson.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE END\r\n\r\n          BOOKS, PAPERS, AND MANUSCRIPTS CITED AND CONSULTED\r\n\r\n          BOOKS, PAPERS, AND MANUSCRIPTS CITED AND CONSULTED\r\n\r\n\r\n     ABDY, EDWARD S., _Journal of a Tour of the United States_. 3 vols.\r\n     London, 1835.\r\n\r\n     ADAMS, JOHN QUINCY, _Memoirs_ of, ed. by C.
