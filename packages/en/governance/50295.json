BURGESS, PH.D., LL.D.\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR OF POLITICAL SCIENCE AND CONSTITUTIONAL LAW, AND DEAN OF THE\r\nFACULTY OF POLITICAL SCIENCE, IN COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW YORK\r\nCHARLES SCRIBNER'S SONS\r\n1905\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOPYRIGHT, 1902, BY\r\nCHARLES SCRIBNER'S SONS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTROW DIRECTORY\r\nPRINTING AND BOOKBINDING COMPANY\r\nNEW YORK\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the memory of\r\n\r\nRICHMOND MAYO-SMITH,\r\n\r\npupil, colleague, and life-long friend, with grief too deep for words\r\nat his loss, this volume is affectionately inscribed by the Author.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my preface to \"The Middle Period\" I wrote that the re-establishment\r\nof a real national brotherhood between the North and the South could be\r\nattained only on the basis of a sincere and genuine acknowledgment by\r\nthe South that secession was an error as well as a failure. I come now\r\nto supplement this contention with the proposition that a corresponding\r\nacknowledgment on the part of the North in regard to Reconstruction\r\nbetween 1866 and 1876 is equally necessary.\r\n\r\nIn making this demand, I must not be understood as questioning in the\r\nslightest degree the sincerity of the North in the main purpose of the\r\nReconstruction policy of that period. On the other hand, I maintain\r\nthat that purpose was entirely praiseworthy. It was simply to secure\r\nthe civil rights of the newly emancipated race, and to re-establish\r\nloyal Commonwealths in the South. But there is now little question that\r\nerroneous means were chosen.\r\n\r\nTwo ways were open for the attainment of the end sought. One was that\r\nwhich was followed, namely, placing the political power in the hands of\r\nthe newly emancipated; and the other was the nationalization of civil\r\nliberty by placing it under the protection of the Constitution and the\r\nnational Judiciary, and holding the districts of the South under\r\nTerritorial civil government until the white race in those districts\r\nshould have sufficiently recovered from its temporary disloyalty to the\r\nUnion to be intrusted again with the powers of Commonwealth local\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt in my own mind that the latter was the proper and\r\ncorrect course. And I have just as little doubt that it would have been\r\nfound to be the truly practicable course. The people in the loyal\r\nCommonwealths were ready in 1866 to place civil liberty as a whole\r\nunder national protection; and not half of the whites of the South\r\nentertained, at that moment, disloyal purposes or feelings. Even the\r\nsolid Democratic South was yet to be made; and I doubt most seriously\r\nif it would ever have been made, except for the great mistakes of the\r\nRepublican party in its choice of means and measures in Reconstruction.\r\n\r\nI will not, however, enter upon the argument in reference to this\r\nquestion at this point. That belongs to the body of the book. I will\r\nonly add that, in my opinion, the North has already yielded assent to\r\nthis proposition, and has already made the required acknowledgment. The\r\npolicy of Mr. Hayes's administration, and of all the administrations\r\nsince his, can be explained and justified only upon this assumption.\r\nAnd now that the United States has embarked in imperial enterprises,\r\nunder the direction of the Republican party, the great Northern party,\r\nthe North is learning every day by valuable experiences that there are\r\nvast differences in political capacity between the races, and that it\r\nis the white man's mission, his duty and his right, to hold the reins\r\nof political power in his own hands for the civilization of the world\r\nand the welfare of mankind.\r\n\r\nLet the South be equally ready, sincere, and manly in the consciousness\r\nand the acknowledgment of its share in past errors, and the\r\nreconciliation will be complete and permanent!\r\n\r\nI have again to express my thanks to my friend and colleague, Dr.\r\nCushing, for his aid in bringing this volume through the press. I\r\ndesire also to acknowledge the courtesy of the New York _Independent_\r\nfor allowing parts of my article on the Geneva Award, published some\r\nyears ago in that esteemed journal, to be incorporated in the last\r\nchapter of this book.\r\n\r\nJOHN W.

This\r\nis a conception which is not easy to acquire, and which, when acquired,\r\nis not easy to hold. The difficulty lies, chiefly, in the tendency to\r\nconfound the idea of a \"State\" in such a system with a state pure and\r\nsimple. Until the distinction between the two is clearly seen and\r\nfirmly applied, no real progress can be made in the theory and practice\r\nof the federal system of government. Now the fundamental principle of a\r\nstate pure and simple is sovereignty, the original, innate, and legally\r\nunlimited power to command and enforce obedience by the infliction of\r\npenalties for disobedience. On the other hand, the nature of a \"State\"\r\nin a system of federal {2} government is a very different thing. Such a\r\n\"State\" is a local self-government, under the supremacy of the general\r\nconstitution, and possessed of residuary powers. In the federal system\r\nof the United States, it is a local self-government, under the\r\nsupremacy of the Constitution of the United States, and of the laws and\r\ntreaties of the central Government made in accordance with that\r\nConstitution, republican as to form, and possessed of residuary\r\npowers--that is, of all powers not vested by the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States exclusively in the central Government, or not denied by\r\nthat Constitution to the \"State.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The different kinds of local government provided for in the\r\nConstitution of the United States.]\r\n\r\nIt must be kept in mind that this is not the only kind of local\r\ngovernment known in the constitutional law and practice of the United\r\nStates. There is, and always has been, since the establishment of the\r\nfederal system in 1789, for the larger part of the population which\r\ndeclared united independence of Great Britain in 1776, another kind of\r\nlocal government for a part of the United States, a local government\r\nwhich is not self-government, a local government which is but an agency\r\nof the central Government. In fact, there have been at times three\r\nkinds of local government in the political system of the United States,\r\nviz., local government by the executive department of the central\r\nGovernment--that is, local government by executive discretion, martial\r\nlaw--local government as an agency of the legislative department of the\r\ncentral Government--that is, Territorial government--and \"State\"\r\ngovernment. That is to say, since 1789 the whole of the United States,\r\nterritorially, has never been under the federal system of government,\r\nbut has _always_ been partly under federal government and partly under\r\nthe exclusive government of Congress, and has _sometimes_ been partly\r\nunder federal government, {3} partly under the exclusive government of\r\nCongress, and partly under the exclusive government of the President.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Local government under the Constitution of the United\r\nStates.]\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of the United States recognizes and provides for all\r\nthree of these species of local government, and vests in Congress the\r\npower of advancing the population of a district, the confines of which\r\ndistrict shall be determined by Congress itself, from the lower to the\r\nhigher forms of local government. While the Constitution does not\r\nexpressly impose upon Congress the duty of making or permitting the\r\nchange from one kind of local government to another, it impliedly\r\nindicates that Congress shall determine the kind of local government\r\nwhich the population of any particular district shall enjoy in\r\naccordance with the conditions prevailing, at any given moment, among\r\nthem. If the maintenance of law and order requires the immediate\r\nexercise of military power, Congress may, and should, permit the\r\ncontinuance of the President's discretionary government. If, on the\r\nother hand, this is not necessary, Congress may, and should, confer\r\ncivil government, under the Territorial form, and when the population\r\nof a Territory shall have become ripe for local self-government and\r\ncapable of maintaining it, Congress may, and should, allow the\r\nTerritory to become a \"State\" of the Union, a Commonwealth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"State\" destructibility in the system of federal\r\ngovernment.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The effect on \"State\" existence of the renunciation of\r\nallegiance to the Union.]\r\n\r\nSuch being the nature of a \"State\" of the Union and such the method of\r\nits creation, what reason is there for speaking of the \"States\" in a\r\nsystem of federal government as indestructible? As they emerge from the\r\nstatus of Territories under the exclusive power of Congress, upon\r\nhaving attained certain conditions, why may they not revert to the\r\nstatus of Territories upon having lost these conditions of \"State\"\r\nexistence; nay, why may {4} they not revert to the status of martial\r\nlaw by having lost all of the conditions of civil government? The\r\ndictum \"once a State always a State\" in a system of federal government\r\nhas no sound reason in it. Under the Constitution of the United States,\r\nevery \"State\" of the Union may through the process of amendment be made\r\na province subject to the exclusive government of the central\r\nauthorities; and when those who wield the powers of a \"State\" renounce\r\nthe \"State's\" allegiance to the United States, renounce the supremacy\r\nof the Constitution of the United States and of the laws of the central\r\nGovernment made in accordance therewith, then from the point of view of\r\npolitical science it will become a state pure and simple, a\r\nsovereignty, if and when it permanently maintains, by its own power or\r\nby the assent of the United States, this attitude against the United\r\nStates, but from the point of view of the constitutional law of the\r\nUnited States it simply destroys one of the fundamental conditions of\r\nlocal self-government, and gives, thus, warrant to the central\r\nGovernment to resume exclusive government in the district, and over the\r\npopulation which has become disorganized by refusing obedience to the\r\nsupreme law of the land, as fixed by the Constitution of the United\r\nStates. Whether the central Government has the physical power, at a\r\ngiven moment, to do this or not, is another question. It certainly has,\r\nat the outset, the legal right. The \"State\" is no longer a \"State\" of\r\nthe Union, nor has it become a state out of the Union. It is simply\r\nnowhere. The land is there and the people are there, but the form of\r\nlocal government over it and them has been changed from local\r\n_self_-government to a Congressional or a Presidential agency, as the\r\ncase may be.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The idea of \"State\" perdurance.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The acceptance of this idea by the Government of the United\r\nStates.]\r\n\r\nNeither is there any reason for holding that the old {5} \"State\"\r\norganization perdures as an abstract something under the forms of\r\nCongressional or Presidential rule, and will emerge of itself when\r\nthese are withdrawn. If the \"State\" form of local government should be\r\nestablished again over that same district and over the population\r\ninhabiting it, it would be an entirely new creation, even though it\r\nshould recognize the forms and laws and obligations of the old \"State.\"\r\nIt must be, however, remembered that both the executive and judicial\r\ndepartments of the United States Government committed themselves fully\r\nto this theory of \"State\" perdurance as an abstract something\r\nunaffected by the loss of the conditions of the \"State\" form of local\r\ngovernment through the rebellion of the \"State\" organization against\r\nthe supremacy of the Constitution and laws of the United States, and\r\nthat Congress did the same thing, at first, in some degree. It was this\r\nerror which caused all of the confusion in the ideas and processes of\r\nReconstruction, and we ought, therefore, to rid ourselves of it at the\r\nstart, at the same time that we recognize its influence over the minds\r\nof those who engaged in the difficult work of the years between 1865\r\nand 1876.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The constitutional results of attempted secession.]\r\n\r\nFrom the view which we take of the nature of a \"State\" in a system of\r\nfederal government, and its possible destructibility, there is not much\r\ndifficulty in determining the constitutional results of an attempt upon\r\nthe part of such a \"State\" to break away from its connections in that\r\nsystem. What it does, stripped of all misconception and verbiage, is\r\nsimply this: it forcibly resists the execution of the whole supreme law\r\nof the land, and destroys the prime condition of its own existence by\r\nmaking it necessary for the central Government to {6} assert exclusive\r\npower in the district where this happens. Naturally the executive\r\ndepartment of the central Government must act first, and subdue by\r\nforce the force which has been offered against the supremacy of the\r\nConstitution and laws of the United States. After that shall have been\r\naccomplished, the question as to how the population in the rebellious\r\ndistrict shall be civilly organized anew, is one for the legislative\r\ndepartment of the central Government exclusively. Congress may fashion\r\nthe boundaries of the district at its own pleasure, and may establish\r\ntherein such a Territorial organization of civil local government as it\r\nmay see fit, and is limited in what it may do in this respect only by\r\nthe constitutional immunities of the individual subject or citizen\r\nunder every form of civil government provided or allowed by the\r\nConstitution of the United States. Congress may also enable the\r\nexisting population of such a district, or such part of that population\r\nas it may designate, to organize the \"State\" form of local government,\r\nand may grant it participation in the powers of the central Government\r\nupon an equality with the other \"States\" in the federal system. These\r\nthings are matters in which the President, as the executive power,\r\ncannot interfere. As participant in legislation, however, he may, at\r\nhis own discretion, use his powers of recommendation and veto.\r\n\r\nIf rebellion against the supremacy of the Constitution and laws of the\r\nUnited States should not be committed by an existing \"State\"\r\norganization, but by a new organization claiming to be the \"State\"\r\norganization within the district concerned, the existing organization\r\nremaining loyal, but requiring the aid of the central Government to\r\nmaintain its authority, then the withdrawal of that aid by the\r\nPresident after the accomplishment of its purpose would, of course,\r\nleave the old {7} \"State\" organization with restored authority, and\r\nCongress would have no function to perform in the re-establishment of\r\ncivil government in such a district, or in the readmission of its\r\npopulation to participation in the central Government. This was the\r\ncourse followed in Missouri and Kentucky, and it was the course, which,\r\nat first, was attempted in the case of Virginia. In the first two cases\r\nit was entirely correct. In the last it had to be abandoned, for\r\nreasons, and on account of conditions, which will be explained later.\r\n\r\nWhat we have, therefore, in the theory and history of Reconstruction is\r\nthe case of existing \"State\" organizations forcibly resisting the\r\nexecution of the supreme law of the land, and stricken down by the\r\nexecutive power of the central Government in the attempt, that power\r\nbeing exercised at its own motion and in its own way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{8}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT LINCOLN'S VIEWS AND ACTS IN REGARD TO RECONSTRUCTION\r\n\r\nDid Mr. Lincoln Have any Theory of Reconstruction?--Mr. Lincoln's\r\nPlan--Mr. Lincoln's Oath of Allegiance, and the Loyal Class to be\r\nCreated by the Taking of this Oath--The Proviso in this Plan--Seward's\r\nIdea of Reconstruction and the Views of Congress and the Judiciary--Ten\r\nPer Centum \"State\" Governments--Reconstruction in Louisiana under Mr.\r\nLincoln's Plan--The New Orleans Convention--The Election of a\r\nGovernor--The Constitutional Convention of April, 1864, and the\r\nConstitution Framed by it and Adopted by the Voters--Reconstruction in\r\nArkansas--The Beginning of Resistance in Congress to the President's\r\nPlans--The Wade-Davis Bill--Analysis of this Measure--The President's\r\nAttitude toward the Bill--The President's Proclamation of July 8th,\r\n1864--The Wade-Davis Protest against the President's Proclamation--The\r\nPresident's Message of December 6th, 1864--The Threatened Schism in the\r\nRepublican Party and the Presidential Election of 1864--The Refusal of\r\nCongress to Count the Electoral Vote from any \"State\" which had Passed\r\nthe Secession Ordinance--Reconstruction in Tennessee--The Twenty-second\r\nJoint Rule--Reconstruction in Tennessee Continued--Civil Government\r\nRe-established in Tennessee--The Thirteenth Amendment to the\r\nConstitution of the United States--The Proposition of Amendment as it\r\nCame from the Judiciary Committee of the Senate--The Passage of the\r\nProposition by the Senate--The House Draft--Rejection of the Senate's\r\nDraft in the House--Reconsideration of the Senate's Measure in the\r\nHouse, and its Final Passage.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Did Mr. Lincoln have any theory of Reconstruction?]\r\n\r\nSome of the ardent admirers of Mr. Lincoln are disposed to dispute the\r\nproposition that he had any theory {9} of Reconstruction. It seems,\r\nhowever, that they are unconsciously influenced in this by their desire\r\nto escape the conviction that Mr. Lincoln held an erroneous theory of\r\nReconstruction. It does not seem that one can read impartially Mr.\r\nLincoln's proclamation of December 8, 1863, without coming to the\r\nconclusion that Mr. Lincoln had a very decided notion on the subject.\r\nIt is true that he said that it must not be understood that no other\r\npossible mode of Reconstruction than that proclaimed by him would be\r\nacceptable, but he laid down a very distinct mode, and he said it was\r\nthe best he could suggest under existing impressions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Lincoln's plan.]\r\n\r\nThis plan recognized, in the first place, the continued existence of\r\nthe \"States\" in rebellion as \"States\" of, and in, the Union. More\r\nexactly, it regarded the rebellion against the United States within\r\nthese \"States\" as the act of combinations of disloyal persons, and not\r\nas the act of the \"States\" at all. These combinations had subverted the\r\nloyal governments within these \"States,\" but the \"States\" themselves\r\nwere not disloyal, because they could not be. They were impersonal\r\nentities, incapable of committing treason or any other wrong. According\r\nto this view the work of Reconstruction consisted simply in placing the\r\nloyal element in a \"State\" in possession of the government of the\r\n\"State.\"\r\n\r\nIn the second place, therefore, Mr. Lincoln's plan contained the\r\nprinciple that the work of Reconstruction was an executive problem. It\r\nwas the work of the Executive, through the power of pardon, to create a\r\nloyal class in a \"State\" which had been the scene of rebellion, and it\r\nwas the work of the Executive to support that class by the military\r\npower in taking possession of, organizing, and operating, the \"State\"\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n{10} [Sidenote: Mr. Lincoln's oath of allegiance, and the loyal class\r\nto be created by the taking of this oath.]\r\n\r\nAnd so, Mr. Lincoln undertook to create such a class by constructing an\r\noath of future loyalty and allegiance to the United States of the\r\nfollowing tenor: \"I, ---- ----, do solemnly swear, in the presence of\r\nAlmighty God, that I will henceforth faithfully support, protect, and\r\ndefend the Constitution of the United States and the union of the\r\nStates thereunder; and that I will in like manner abide by and\r\nfaithfully support all acts of Congress passed during the existing\r\nrebellion with reference to slaves, so long and so far as not repealed,\r\nmodified, or held void, by Congress or by decision of the Supreme\r\nCourt; and that I will in like manner abide by and faithfully support\r\nall proclamations of the President during the existing rebellion having\r\nreference to slaves, so long and so far as not modified by the Supreme\r\nCourt. So help me God;\" and by ordaining that all persons who would\r\nvoluntarily take this oath, unless they had been civil or diplomatic\r\nofficers of the \"so-called Confederate Government,\" or military\r\nofficers thereof above the rank of colonel in the army or lieutenant in\r\nthe navy, or had left seats in the United States Congress or judicial\r\noffice under the United States, or had resigned commissions in the army\r\nor navy of the United States, in order to aid in the rebellion, or had\r\nbeen engaged in treating colored persons found in the United States\r\nservice in any capacity, or white persons in charge of them, in any\r\nother manner than as prisoners of war, would be regarded as having\r\nre-established their loyalty and allegiance to the United States.\r\n\r\nAnd he then undertook to put this class in possession of the functions\r\nand powers of the \"loyal State governments\" subverted by the rebellion,\r\nby proclaiming and declaring, \"that whenever in any of the States of\r\n{11} Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Alabama,\r\nGeorgia, Florida, South Carolina, and North Carolina, a number of\r\npersons, not less than one-tenth in number of the votes cast in such\r\nState at the Presidential election of the year A.D. 1860, each having\r\ntaken the oath aforesaid, and not having since violated it, and being a\r\nqualified voter by the election law of the State existing immediately\r\nbefore the so-called act of secession, and excluding all others, shall\r\nre-establish a State government which shall be republican and nowise\r\ncontravening said oath, such shall be recognized as the true government\r\nof the State, and the State shall receive thereunder the benefits of\r\nthe constitutional provision which declares that 'the United States\r\nshall guarantee to every State in this Union a republican form of\r\ngovernment and shall protect each of them against invasion, and, on\r\napplication of the Legislature, or the executive (when the Legislature\r\ncannot be convened) against domestic violence.'\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The proviso in this plan.]\r\n\r\nIt is true that Mr. Lincoln was careful to say in this proclamation\r\nthat \"whether members sent to Congress from any State shall be admitted\r\nto seats, constitutionally rests exclusively with the respective\r\nHouses, and not to any extent with the Executive,\" but it is plain that\r\nhe did not think the Houses could constitutionally use their power of\r\njudging of the qualifications and elections of their members to keep\r\nmembers from \"States\" reconstructed upon his plan from taking their\r\nseats on the ground that these \"States\" had not been properly\r\nreconstructed.\r\n\r\nAnd it is also true that there occurs in the proclamation another\r\nparagraph which appears to militate against the theory of the\r\nperdurance of a \"State\" through the period of its rebellion against the\r\nUnited States. It reads: \"And it is suggested as not improper that in\r\n{12} constructing a loyal State government in any State the name of the\r\nState, the boundary, the subdivisions, the constitution and the general\r\ncode of laws as before the rebellion be maintained, subject only to the\r\nmodifications made necessary by the conditions hereinbefore stated, and\r\nsuch others, if any, not contravening such conditions which may be\r\ndeemed expedient by those framing the new State government.\"\r\n\r\nIt certainly may appear from this language that while Mr. Lincoln\r\nregarded it as convenient and desirable that the new \"State\" should be\r\nconsidered a continuation of the old \"State,\" yet that he did not look\r\nupon it as absolutely necessary. Still, it seems more probable that\r\nthis was only his cautious habit of leaving open a way of escape out of\r\nany position when necessity or prudence might require its abandonment\r\nthan that he doubted the correctness of his idea of the\r\nindestructibility of the \"States\" in spite of the rebellion of a part\r\nof their population, or even of the whole of their population.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Seward's idea of Reconstruction, and the views of Congress\r\nand the Court.]\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln was not alone in this view of the nature of the \"States\" of\r\nthe Union and the problem of Reconstruction. His able Secretary of\r\nState certainly agreed with him; the resolutions and acts of Congress\r\ndown to that time may be better explained upon this theory than upon\r\nany other; and so far as the Supreme Court had dealt with the question,\r\nits dicta, if not its exact decisions, had indicated the same trend of\r\nopinion. The President felt, therefore, no hesitation in applying his\r\nplan in the specific cases that were in a condition for its\r\nrealization.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Virginia not in need of Reconstruction according to\r\nPresident Lincoln's view.]\r\n\r\nBefore treating of his reconstruction of Louisiana and Arkansas under\r\nthis plan, however, there are two points of the proclamation which\r\nshould be briefly noticed. {13} The first is the omission of Virginia\r\nfrom the names of the \"States\" to which the proclamation should apply.\r\nThe reason for this is simple, and easily understood. The President had\r\nalways recognized what was called the Pierpont Government at Alexandria\r\nas the true government of Virginia. Virginia, therefore, according to\r\nhis view needed no reconstruction. It belonged in the class with\r\nKentucky and Missouri.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ten per centum \"State\" governments.]\r\n\r\nThe other point is the proposition to found \"State\" government upon ten\r\nper centum of the population of the \"State.\" Now we know that \"State\"\r\ngovernment in the federal system of the United States is local\r\nself-government. But local self-government cannot really exist where\r\nthe part of the population holding the legal authority does not really\r\npossess the sinews of power; and where the conditions of the society\r\nare democratic, or anything like democratic, one-tenth of the\r\npopulation cannot really possess the sinews of power. The actual power\r\nto make their government valid, to enable their government to govern\r\nwould have to come from the outside. While this may happen under\r\ncertain temporary exigencies without destroying local self-government\r\non the whole, yet it cannot be permitted as a principle upon which to\r\nbuild a local self-government, a \"State\" in a federal system.\r\nProvincial governments, Territorial governments may be sustained in\r\nthat way, but the distinguishing principle of \"State\" government\r\nforbids it. It is simply not \"State\" government when holding in this\r\nway the power to govern, as the principle of its life, no matter what\r\nname we may give it. Upon this point, then, Mr. Lincoln's reasoning was\r\ncrude and erroneous, and when applied was destined to result in\r\nmischievous error.\r\n\r\n{14} [Sidenote: Reconstruction in Louisiana under Mr. Lincoln's plan.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The election of members of Congress.]\r\n\r\nAs far back as the first week in December of 1862 General Shepley, then\r\nMilitary Governor of Louisiana, had, by permission from the President,\r\nordered an election for members of Congress, in the districts over\r\nwhich his jurisdiction extended. The President had cautioned him\r\nagainst any choice of Northern men at the point of the bayonet, and had\r\ndeclared to him that such a procedure would be \"disgraceful and\r\noutrageous.\" The General heeded the warning, and two old citizens of\r\nLouisiana, Messrs. Hahn and Flanders, were chosen, and were admitted by\r\nthe House of Representatives to their seats. This happened in February\r\nof 1863, and it was certainly good evidence that the House of\r\nRepresentatives was, at that moment, resting on the theory of the\r\nperdurance of the \"State\" of Louisiana throughout the rebellion within\r\nits limits against the United States.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The New Orleans convention.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The election of a governor.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The constitutional convention of April, 1864, and the\r\nconstitution framed by it and adopted by the voters.]\r\n\r\nThings went no further than this, however, during the year 1863, the\r\nmilitary situation requiring the whole thought and activity of the\r\nGovernment. On the 8th of January, 1864, however, a convention was held\r\nat New Orleans for the purpose of advancing the work of reconstruction.\r\nThis convention requested General Banks to appoint an election for\r\nofficers of the \"State\" government. The General complied, naming the\r\n22d day of February following for the election, and the 4th of March\r\nfor the installation of the officers so chosen. Mr. Hahn was elected\r\nand duly installed Governor, and was soon after declared by the\r\nPresident to be \"invested, until further orders, with the powers\r\nhitherto exercised by the Military Governor of Louisiana.\" The next\r\nstep was for the new Governor to order an election of delegates to a\r\nconstitutional convention and the assembly of {15} the same in\r\nconvention, for the purpose of so amending and revising the\r\nconstitution as to make it fit the new conditions created by the war.\r\nThis was done in March and April of 1864, and an anti-slavery\r\nconstitution was established for Louisiana. The instrument drafted and\r\nproposed by the convention was adopted by the voters. Eight thousand\r\nfour hundred and two votes were cast upon the question of adoption,\r\nabout sixteen per centum of the vote cast at the Presidential election\r\nof 1860. This brought the action of the voters within the President's\r\nten per centum rule. The vote was almost five to one in favor of\r\nadoption. The President's scheme was now put to the practical test,\r\nboth in Louisiana and Arkansas, during the spring of 1864.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The beginning of resistance in Congress to the President's\r\nplan.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Wade-Davis bill.]\r\n\r\nCongress was, however, by this time becoming convinced that\r\nReconstruction was a legislative problem, that is, a problem to be\r\nsolved by Congressional acts and constitutional amendment. This is\r\nevidenced not only by the fact that neither House would admit\r\nrepresentatives from Arkansas elected under the new \"State\"\r\norganization to seats, but by the more pronounced attitude expressed in\r\nwhat is known as the Wade-Davis measure upon the direct question at\r\nissue. These gentlemen, Mr. Benjamin F. Wade and Mr. Henry Winter\r\nDavis, the former the chairman of the \"Committee on the Rebellious\r\nStates\" in the Senate, and the latter the chairman of a committee\r\nhaving the same name and functions in the House, originated a bill and\r\ncarried it through both Houses of Congress, which, for the first time,\r\nembodied the views of Congress on the subject of Reconstruction. This\r\nbill was finally passed on July 4, 1864, and it contained provisions of\r\nthe following tenor: The eleven \"States\" which had passed {16}\r\nsecession ordinances were all treated as rebellious communities, and\r\nthe President was authorized to appoint a provisional governor for\r\neach. This governor should exercise all the powers of civil government\r\nin the community to which he might be appointed until \"State\"\r\ngovernment should be recognized by Congress as restored therein. An\r\noath of future allegiance to the Constitution of the United States was\r\nthen prescribed, and the provisional governor in each \"State\" was\r\nordered, whenever rebellion in his \"State\" should be suppressed, to\r\ndirect the United States Marshal to enroll all the white male citizens\r\nof the United States, resident within the \"State,\" in the respective\r\ncounties of the \"State,\" and give them the opportunity to take the oath\r\nof allegiance to the United States. The bill then directed that when a\r\nmajority of such citizens should take this oath, they might be\r\npermitted to elect delegates to a convention, which convention might\r\ntake action for the establishment of \"State\" government. The bill\r\ndisqualified all persons who had held any office, civil or military,\r\n\"State\" or Confederate, in rebellion against the United States, or who\r\nhad voluntarily borne arms against the United States, from voting for\r\ndelegates, or from being elected as delegates, to the convention. The\r\nbill then provided that the convention thus elected and assembled might\r\nform a \"State\" constitution, but must insert in it clauses abolishing\r\nslavery, repudiating all debts, \"State\" or Confederate, created by, or\r\nunder the sanction of, the usurping power, and disqualifying all\r\npersons who had held office civil or military, \"State\" or Confederate,\r\nunder the usurping power, except civil offices merely ministerial, and\r\nmilitary offices below the rank of colonel, from voting or being\r\nelected governor or members of the legislature. The bill then provided\r\nfor the submission of the constitution so formed to the voters, {17}\r\nand if ratified by a majority thereof, required the provisional\r\ngovernor to certify the same to the President. It then provided that\r\nthe President, after obtaining the consent of Congress thereto, should\r\nproclaim the new \"State\" government as established, and as the\r\nconstitutional government of the \"State,\" after which Representatives\r\nand Senators in Congress, and electors of the President, might be\r\nchosen in said \"State.\" Finally, the bill abolished slavery at once in\r\nall the rebellious \"States\" and imposed penalties upon all persons\r\nattempting thereafter to hold anyone in involuntary servitude; and\r\ndeclared all persons who should thereafter hold office civil or\r\nmilitary, \"State\" or Confederate, in the rebel service, except an\r\noffice purely ministerial or under the grade of colonel, not to be\r\ncitizens of the United States.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Analysis of this measure.]\r\n\r\nA brief analysis of this bill will show that Congress was nearer to\r\nsome doctrine on the subject of Reconstruction than was the President.\r\nIn the first place, Congress claimed Reconstruction as a legislative\r\nproblem. This was undoubtedly the true theory upon that point. In the\r\nsecond place, Congress required the loyalty to the United States of at\r\nleast a majority of the white adult males as the basis of \"State\"\r\ngovernment, local self-government. That also was undoubtedly true\r\npolitical theory as has been already explained. In the third place,\r\nCongress asserted the power to abolish slavery within the limits of\r\nthose \"States\" whose legislatures or conventions had passed the\r\nordinances of secession. That is, Congress dealt with these districts\r\nnot as \"States\" of the Union, but as territories or districts subject\r\nto the exclusive authority of the central Government. Congress was here\r\nbeginning, at least, to act upon the idea that the districts in\r\nrebellion did not perdure, as \"States,\" {18} throughout the rebellion,\r\nbut had lost thereby the forms, powers and functions of \"State\"\r\ngovernments, and were neither out of the Union nor in the Union as\r\n\"States,\" but were under the central Government of the Union as\r\nterritory inhabited by a population disorganized as to local\r\ngovernment. This was also sound political science, and the President\r\nought to have heeded its teachings.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The President's attitude toward the bill.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The President's proclamation of July 8, 1864.]\r\n\r\nBut he did not. He did not, it is true, veto the bill. He simply\r\nallowed the session to expire without signing it. This having happened\r\nin less than ten days from the time it was submitted to him, the bill\r\nfailed, as provided in such cases by the Constitution. He, however,\r\nissued on the 8th of July a proclamation in regard to the subject, in\r\nwhich he objected to the setting aside of the \"free State constitutions\r\nand governments already adopted and installed in Arkansas and\r\nLouisiana;\" doubted the competency of Congress to abolish slavery\r\nwithin the \"States;\" expressed the hope and expectation that this might\r\nbe done for the whole country by constitutional amendment; declared his\r\nwillingness to have the loyal people in any of the rebellious \"States\"\r\nreconstruct their governments upon the Congressional plan, if they\r\nshould choose to do so; but declared also his unwillingness to commit\r\nhimself inflexibly to any single plan of restoration; and virtually\r\nasked the voters to make the difference between himself and Congress\r\nupon the subject an issue in the coming Presidential election.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Wade-Davis protest against the President's\r\nproclamation.]\r\n\r\nThis was one of the boldest acts of Mr. Lincoln's career as President,\r\nand it is little wonder that men of so much intelligence, courage and\r\ntenacity as Messrs. Wade and Davis did not allow the proclamation to go\r\nunanswered. Congress had adjourned, as we have seen, before the\r\nappearance of the proclamation. There was, {19} therefore, no way for\r\nCongress as a whole to make immediate answer. Messrs. Wade and Davis\r\nbelieved that the public interests would suffer if the answer should be\r\npostponed until the next meeting of Congress. They, therefore, issued a\r\nprotest against the proclamation over their own names. The protest was\r\nprinted in the New York _Tribune_ of August 5, 1864. It was an\r\nintemperate arraignment of the President. It declared, among other\r\nthings, that \"a more studied outrage on the legislative authority of\r\nthe people had never been perpetrated;\" that the President had \"greatly\r\npresumed on the forbearance which the supporters of his Administration\"\r\nhad \"so long practised, in view of the arduous conflict in which\" they\r\nwere \"engaged and the reckless ferocity of\" their \"political\r\nopponents;\" that he must understand that their support was not of a man\r\nbut of a cause; and that he must confine himself to his executive\r\nduties, and leave political reorganization to Congress.\r\n\r\nSuch denunciations of the President's purposes could have but one\r\neffect, viz., the strengthening of his hands by the support of the\r\npeople, who so generally trusted him, in the election of 1864. It\r\ninjured Mr. Davis so much that he failed of even a renomination for his\r\nseat in Congress.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The President's message of December 6, 1864.]\r\n\r\nThe President, on the other hand, used his triumph with great tact and\r\nmoderation. He made no reference, in his message of December 6, 1864,\r\neither to his proclamation or to the protest which had been so fiercely\r\nhurled against it. He simply informed Congress that important movements\r\nhad occurred during the year \"to the effect of molding society for\r\ndurability in the Union;\" and that \"12,000 citizens in each of the\r\nStates of Arkansas and Louisiana\" had \"organized loyal State {20}\r\ngovernments, with free constitutions, and\" were \"earnestly struggling\r\nto maintain and administer them.\" He also spoke of the gratifying\r\nsituation and movements in Maryland, Kentucky, Missouri and Tennessee.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The threatened schism in the Republican party, and the\r\nPresidential election of 1864.]\r\n\r\nIt may be that Mr. Lincoln did not interpret his great victory at the\r\npolls in November preceding as a specific approval of his\r\nReconstruction policy. In the spring and early summer of 1864, the\r\nRepublican party was threatened with schism largely upon the subject of\r\nReconstruction. Eight days before the meeting of the regular nominating\r\nconvention of the party, that is on the 31st of May, some three hundred\r\nand fifty men, representing, or professing to represent, the more\r\nradical element of the party, met in convention at Cleveland, Ohio.\r\nGeneral John Cochrane of New York was made chairman of the body, and\r\nGeneral John C. Frémont and General John Cochrane were nominated by it\r\nfor the presidency and vice-presidency of the United States. The\r\ntwelfth section of the platform provided, \"that the reconstruction of\r\nthe rebel States belongs to the people, through their representatives\r\nin Congress, and not to the Executive.\"\r\n\r\nThe regular convention met June 7th at Baltimore, and adopted a\r\nplatform which took no sides in regard to Reconstruction, but simply\r\nsought to rally all Union men around the President for the purpose of\r\nsaving the Union and putting an end to the rebellion. Many war\r\nDemocrats took part in it who favored Lincoln's ideas of\r\nReconstruction, and many Republicans who did not. The Democratic\r\nconvention met at Chicago August 27th and adopted a platform which\r\nvirtually proclaimed the war a failure, and demanded a cessation of\r\nhostilities preparatory to a compromise with the Confederates. Their\r\nnominee, General McClellan, with whom was {21} associated on the ticket\r\nMr. George H. Pendleton of Ohio, repudiated the platform but accepted\r\nthe nomination and made the race.\r\n\r\nUnder the condition of schism in the Republican ranks, his chances\r\nseemed at first fair. But on September 21st, Generals Frémont and\r\nCochrane, the nominees of the radical Republicans, withdrew from the\r\ncontest, and the reunion of the Republican party on the Baltimore\r\nplatform was effected. It was thus a question whether the overwhelming\r\nelectoral vote for Lincoln and Johnson, two hundred and twelve to\r\ntwenty-one for McClellan and Pendleton, meant the approval of Lincoln's\r\nviews and acts in Reconstruction, and it certainly behooved the\r\nPresident to exercise some caution in so interpreting it, especially as\r\nthere was no such wide difference in the popular vote, the McClellan\r\nelectors having received 1,835,985 votes to 2,330,552 for the Lincoln\r\nelectors. There is no question, however, that the President still\r\nbelieved in the correctness of his method and was determined to pursue\r\nthe course upon which he had entered.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: No change in the views of Congress caused by the\r\nPresidential election.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The refusal of Congress to count the electoral vote from any\r\n\"State\" which had passed the secession ordinance.]\r\n\r\nNeither was there any sign manifested that Congress would desist from\r\npressing its views of its own powers in the matter. Both Houses had\r\nrefused to admit members from the reconstructed \"States,\" and now they\r\npassed a joint resolution, on February 4th, 1865, which prohibited the\r\ncounting of any electoral votes for President and Vice-President in the\r\nelection of 1864, from \"States\" which had passed the secession\r\nordinance. Elections had been held in Louisiana and also in Tennessee,\r\nand this resolution was intended to prevent the counting of the votes\r\nwhich the persons chosen electors for Louisiana and Tennessee should\r\nsend in. The resolution was sent to the President for his signature. He\r\n{22} hesitated for several days, but approved it at last on the day\r\nthat Congress counted the electoral votes, February 8th. In doing so,\r\nhowever, he addressed a message to Congress informing the two Houses\r\nthat he had signed it out of deference to their views, and saying that\r\n\"in his own view, however, the two Houses of Congress, convened under\r\nthe twelfth article of the Constitution, have complete power to exclude\r\nfrom counting all electoral votes deemed by them to be illegal; and it\r\nis not competent for the Executive to defeat or obstruct that power by\r\na veto, as would be the case if his action were at all essential in the\r\nmatter. He disclaims all rights of the Executive to interfere in any\r\nway in the matter of canvassing or counting electoral votes, and he\r\nalso disclaims that, by signing said resolution, he has expressed any\r\nopinion on the recitals of the preamble or any judgment of his own upon\r\nthe subject of the resolution.\" The recitals of the preamble referred\r\nto read thus: \"Whereas, the inhabitants and local authorities of the\r\nStates of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida,\r\nAlabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas and Tennessee rebelled\r\nagainst the Government of the United States, and were in such condition\r\non the 8th day of November, 1864, that no valid election for electors\r\nof President and Vice-President of the United States, according to the\r\nConstitution and Laws thereof, was held therein on said day, etc.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reconstruction in Tennessee.]\r\n\r\nLouisiana, which had fulfilled the President's conditions of\r\nreconstruction, was thus included in this list, and also Tennessee,\r\nwhere by order of Governor Andrew Johnson, the candidate for\r\nVice-President on the Lincoln ticket, an election of electors had been\r\nheld. Tennessee had not, at the time of the counting of the {23}\r\nelectoral vote, completed any process of reconstruction. The\r\nconvention, called at Governor Johnson's instigation to meet at\r\nNashville for the purpose of nominating candidates for Presidential\r\nelectors, had called a constitutional convention to meet in Nashville\r\non December 19th, following the Presidential election, for the purpose\r\nof undertaking the work of reconstruction. Hood's advance upon\r\nNashville delayed its meeting, however, until January 3d. This\r\nconvention took the old constitution of Tennessee as its starting-point\r\nand subjected it to a pretty thorough revision in the direction of a\r\n\"free State government.\" It also prescribed a rather stiff test oath\r\nfor all persons offering to vote upon the adoption of the amendments,\r\nan oath which not only promised future loyalty to the Constitution of\r\nthe United States, such as Lincoln had prescribed, but which also\r\nrequired the taker of it to swear that he was an active friend of the\r\nGovernment of the United States, and an enemy of the so-called\r\nConfederate States. The amended constitution had not, however, been\r\nsubmitted to the voters at the date when Congress counted the electoral\r\nvote, that is, before the 8th of February, 1865, and of course no\r\n\"State\" government had been elected under the amended constitution. The\r\nvote upon the constitution occurred on the 22d of February, and the\r\nelection of the Governor and the members of the Legislature under it\r\noccurred on March 4th.\r\n\r\nThe case of Tennessee did not from this point of view appear as strong\r\nas that of Louisiana. But it is difficult to see how the Republicans\r\ncould have consistently rejected the vote of Tennessee after having\r\nnominated and elected a citizen of Tennessee as Vice-President of the\r\nUnited States. It is certainly implied in the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States that no man is {24} eligible to the office of\r\nVice-President unless he be at the time of his election a citizen of a\r\n\"State\" of the Union. The Constitution implies that the Vice-President\r\nshall have the same qualifications as the President; and it distinctly\r\nsays that in giving their vote, the electors in each \"State\" shall vote\r\nfor two persons, \"of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of\r\nthe same State with themselves.\" If an inhabitant of Tennessee could be\r\nlawfully Vice-President of the United States, it does certainly seem\r\nimplied that Tennessee was, at the time, a \"State\" of the Union in\r\nregular standing.\r\n\r\nHowever this may have been, the President was certainly correct in\r\nsaying that Congress was vested with full power over the count of the\r\nelectoral vote, and that the Executive had no control over it\r\nwhatsoever. It was a bit of harmless good humor that he signed the\r\nresolution as a perfunctory matter, and it was calculated to improve\r\nthe temper of the somewhat irritated members of Congress.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The twenty-second joint rule.]\r\n\r\nCongress was not, however, formally notified of the fact that he had\r\nsigned the measure until after the counting of the vote had been\r\nfinished, and the two Houses met the exigency by the enactment of what\r\nwas known as \"the twenty-second joint rule,\" according to which the\r\nconsent of both Houses was required to count the electoral vote from\r\nany \"State\" or any body or place professing to be a \"State.\" As a\r\nmatter of fact, the Vice-President, Mr. Hamlin, declared that he had in\r\nhis possession returns from the \"States\" of Louisiana and Tennessee,\r\nbut held it to be his duty not to present them, and he did not present\r\nthem. He knew that the President had signed the joint resolution,\r\nalthough Congress had not been officially notified of it, and he acted\r\nunder the {25} resolution as law. The joint rule would have required\r\nthe presentation of these votes to the joint meeting of the two Houses,\r\nand would have required the concurrence of the two Houses, acting\r\nseparately, to have included them in the count. The joint rule was,\r\ntherefore, not applied to the case for which it was enacted, but it\r\nremained unrepealed for more than ten years, and then showed itself a\r\nsort of Nemesis to its creators.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reconstruction in Tennessee continued.]\r\n\r\nTennessee pursued, however, the course of reconstruction upon which she\r\nhad set out. Her test oath, as we have seen, required virtually that\r\nthe basis of her reorganization should be the men who had _remained_\r\nloyal throughout the rebellion. It differed thus from Mr. Lincoln's\r\noath, which rehabilitated those who would promise future loyalty. The\r\nvote in favor of the new constitution, which was the old constitution\r\nof the \"State\" amended by articles abolishing slavery, nullifying\r\nsecession, and repudiating the debt created in aid of the rebellion,\r\nwas more than twenty-five thousand, nearly twenty per centum of the\r\nvote for Presidential electors in 1860. This certainly much more than\r\nfulfilled all of Mr. Lincoln's conditions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Civil government re-established in Tennessee.]\r\n\r\nGovernor Johnson issued his proclamation on February 25th, 1865,\r\ndeclaring the adoption of the new constitution, and ordering the\r\nelection of the Governor and legislative members under it for March\r\n4th. W. G. Brownlow was chosen Governor. The newly elected legislature\r\ndid not meet, however, until April 2d, and Mr. Brownlow was not\r\ninaugurated as civil Governor until April 7th. As Mr. Johnson was\r\ninaugurated Vice-President on March 4th, he had been obliged to lay\r\ndown the military governorship on that date, in fact, a few days\r\nbefore, and Mr. Brownlow had been appointed {26} in his stead. Upon\r\nBrownlow's inauguration as civil Governor, the military régime in\r\nTennessee was formally ended. Lincoln acquiesced certainly in this\r\nchange.\r\n\r\nIt remained now for Congress to show its attitude, when the Senators\r\nand Representatives from Tennessee should present themselves for\r\nadmission to seats in the two Houses. As this could not happen until\r\nthe following December, the history of this point must be deferred\r\nuntil the events between March 4th and December 4th are related.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United\r\nStates.]\r\n\r\nThe experiences of the year 1863 with the slavery problem had convinced\r\nthe President and the leaders of the Republican party in Congress that\r\nabolition must be effected by a constitutional amendment. The military\r\nacts of the President in this direction were, as all the purely\r\nmilitary measures of the Executive, temporary, and with the\r\nre-establishment of peace would cease to have force; and it was by this\r\ntime pretty clear that but few of the \"States\" would abolish slavery by\r\ntheir own act. Already on January 11, 1864, had the proposition for a\r\nconstitutional amendment abolishing slavery throughout the length and\r\nbreadth of the United States been presented in the Senate by Mr. John\r\nB. Henderson of Missouri, and referred to the Judiciary Committee of\r\nthat body for consideration and report.\r\n\r\nThe language of the first article of Mr. Henderson's proposition read:\r\n\"Slavery or involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime,\r\nshall not exist in the United States.\" When it came back from the\r\nJudiciary Committee, as reported by Mr. Trumbull, it was called Article\r\nXIII., and read: \"Sec. 1. Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude,\r\nexcept as a punishment for crime, whereof the party shall have been\r\nduly convicted, shall {27} exist in the United States or any place\r\nsubject to their jurisdiction. Sec. 2. Congress shall have power to\r\nenforce this article by appropriate legislation.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The proposition of amendment as it came from the Judiciary\r\nCommittee of the Senate.]\r\n\r\nIt will be advantageous in our further consideration of this article to\r\nrecall briefly the reasons for these divergencies. The language used by\r\nthe Judiciary Committee corresponds almost exactly with the wording of\r\nthe ordinance of the Northwest Territory of 1787; and it is entirely\r\nevident that the Judiciary Committee had that act in mind when it\r\nreported the article. Mr. Henderson's proposition was that slavery or\r\ninvoluntary servitude should not exist in the _United States_. He well\r\nunderstood that it did not require a constitutional amendment to\r\nabolish slavery from those parts of the country where \"States\" had not\r\nbeen formed. He knew that Congress could do that. The Judiciary\r\nCommittee, however, did not think it wise or necessary to \"make two\r\nbites of a cherry.\" They preferred to make their prohibition apply to\r\nthe whole country. They knew that the phrase _United States_ was\r\ncapable of being interpreted to mean only that part of the country\r\nwhere \"States\" existed, and they preferred and intended to make their\r\nprohibition of slavery extend to the whole country. From abundant\r\ncaution they used the words United States, with the additional words\r\n\"any place subject to their jurisdiction,\" in order to cover all\r\nterritory over which the flag of the Union should fly in sovereign\r\npower.\r\n\r\nThe second section, giving to Congress special power to enforce this\r\narticle, seems, at first, unnecessary, because according to the last\r\nparagraph of Section 8, Article I., of the Constitution, Congress is\r\nvested with the authority to make all laws necessary and proper to\r\ncarry into execution all the powers vested by the {28} Constitution in\r\nany department or officer of the Government. This abolition of slavery\r\nwas, however, a restriction on the \"States.\" It laid a new limitation\r\nupon their powers, and hence it was thought that Section 8 of Article\r\nI. might not apply in the execution of such a provision against the\r\n\"States.\" But if we regard the provision from the point of view of the\r\nrights of an individual to his freedom against any \"State\" law to the\r\ncontrary, then we must see that the amendment does invest the United\r\nStates courts with the power to impose the restriction in behalf of the\r\nindividual seeking deliverance from the attempt of a \"State\" to enslave\r\nhim or to continue his enslavement. And once the power vested in the\r\ncourts to do this the general provision of Article I., Section 8, will\r\ncertainly apply. The resolution offered by the Judiciary Committee\r\npassed the Senate by the requisite majority on the 8th of April, 1864.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The House draft.]\r\n\r\nDuring this same period, Mr. William Windom, of Minnesota, offered in\r\nthe House of Representatives a resolution upon the subject in the\r\nidentical words of the Senate's resolution. It was referred to the\r\nJudiciary Committee of the House, February 15, 1864. While it lay in\r\nthe room of the Committee, Mr. Stevens offered a substitute for it,\r\nwhich read: \"Slavery and involuntary servitude, except as a punishment\r\nfor crime, whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, is forever\r\nprohibited in the United States and all its Territories.\" This is\r\nanother bit of evidence for the proposition that what was meant by the\r\nwords \"or any place subject to their jurisdiction\" in Mr. Trumbull's\r\nresolution was all parts of the country not enjoying \"State\" government\r\nin local matters.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rejection of the Senate's draft in the House.]\r\n\r\nThe Senate resolution was sent into the House on the {29} 31st of May,\r\nand was there lost on June 15th, having received a large majority,\r\nindeed, in its favor, but not a two-thirds majority.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reconsideration of the Senate's measure in the House, and\r\nits final passage.]\r\n\r\nForeseeing the failure of the resolution at that juncture, Mr. J. M.\r\nAshley, of Ohio, voted against the measure, although a stanch friend of\r\nit. His purpose was of course to be able to move, at some future and\r\nmore propitious time, a reconsideration of the subject. He did not,\r\nhowever, feel that that time had arrived until after the election and\r\nthe military victories of the autumn of 1864 had manifested the temper\r\nof the voters on the question of abolition and demonstrated the power\r\nof the Union to carry such a measure into execution. On the 31st of\r\nJanuary, 1865, Mr. Ashley moved a reconsideration of the Senate\r\nresolution lost in the House on the 15th of the preceding June.\r\nReconsideration was immediately voted, and the Senate resolution was\r\nthen carried by the requisite two-thirds majority.\r\n\r\nThe proposed amendment was then sent to the President, who signed it,\r\nFebruary 1st, 1865. Whereupon the Senate immediately passed another\r\nresolution, declaring that it was through an inadvertency that the\r\nmeasure had been sent to the President for his signature, that asking\r\nthe President of the United States to sign a proposed constitutional\r\namendment was an error, was without precedent in the practice of the\r\nGovernment, and that the President's approval should not be\r\ncommunicated to the House. A concurrent resolution was then passed by\r\nthe two Houses authorizing the President to submit the proposed article\r\nof amendment to the \"States\" for ratification. The Secretary of State\r\nimmediately sent it to the legislatures of all the \"States\" which could\r\nbe reached by him, and during the summer and autumn to the legislatures\r\nof all the \"States;\" {30} and the new legislature of Tennessee ratified\r\nit on the 5th of April, 1865, that is, more than a week before\r\nLincoln's death.\r\n\r\nSuch was the condition of things when the assassin's bullet ended the\r\nlife of the great and good President and brought the Vice-President,\r\nMr. Johnson, into the office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{31}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT JOHNSON'S PLAN OF RECONSTRUCTION AND HIS PROCEEDINGS IN\r\nREALIZATION OF IT\r\n\r\nThe Character of Mr. Johnson--The Radical Nature of Johnson's First\r\nViews on Reconstruction--The Retention of Lincoln's Cabinet by Mr.\r\nJohnson and the Modification of Johnson's Views by Mr. Seward's\r\nArguments--Johnson's Amnesty Proclamation of May 29th, 1865--The\r\nExcepted Classes--The Effect of these Exceptions--The President's\r\nPlan--The Realization of it--The Administering of the\r\nOath--Reconstruction in North Carolina--The Identity of Johnson's Plan\r\nwith that of Lincoln--Reconstruction in Mississippi--Reconstruction in\r\nGeorgia--Reconstruction in Alabama, South Carolina and\r\nFlorida--Reconstruction in Virginia--Reconstruction in Louisiana,\r\nArkansas and Tennessee--The Constitutional Conventions of 1865--The\r\nForm of the Work Done in these Conventions, and its Substance--The\r\nErection of \"State\" Governments and the Election of Members of\r\nCongress--The Orders of the President Putting the Civil Government of\r\nthe United States into Operation Everywhere--The President's First\r\nAnnual Message.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The character of Mr. Johnson.]\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson was a man who rose from very low estate through his own\r\nefforts. He was a man of considerable intellectual power and of great\r\nwill power. He was somewhat vain of his success and somewhat piqued by\r\nthe social neglect which he had suffered at the hands of the \"old\r\nfamilies.\" He was intensely loyal to the Union, and could regard\r\nsecession and rebellion only as treason. Having suffered so much for\r\nhis loyalty, he was somewhat moved by considerations of revenge. He was\r\nprofoundly stirred by {32} the assassination of Lincoln, and apparently\r\nbelieved it to have been planned by those high in authority in the\r\nConfederacy; and he was possessed with an intense desire to\r\nre-establish the Union on an enduring foundation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The radical nature of Johnson's first views on\r\nReconstruction.]\r\n\r\nWith such a history behind him, and such a disposition impelling him,\r\nit is not to be wondered at that his policy in regard to Reconstruction\r\nshould have been more stringent than that of Mr. Lincoln. In fact it\r\nwas feared, even by the more radical Republicans, such, for instance,\r\nas Mr. Wade, that he would be bloody minded in the treatment of the\r\nrebel chiefs. He had, before his accession to the Presidency, declared\r\nso often, and so vehemently, that \"traitors should be arrested, tried,\r\nconvicted and hanged,\" that most men were expecting the strict\r\napplication of the criminal law to the Confederate leaders.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The retention of Lincoln's Cabinet by Mr. Johnson, and the\r\nmodification of Johnson's views by Mr. Seward's arguments.]\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson retained Lincoln's Cabinet, and among them the conciliatory\r\nand persuasive Seward, who, in about six weeks from the night of the\r\nassassination, at which time he himself was seriously wounded, returned\r\nto his work in the State Department. There is no doubt that it was the\r\ninfluence of Seward which modified the views and purposes of Mr.\r\nJohnson. The compliant spirit manifested at this time by the\r\nConfederate chiefs helped strongly in the same direction. By the 1st of\r\nJune, Seward had won Johnson completely for his plan of a rapid and\r\nforgiving reconstruction by the Executive. Congress was not in session,\r\nand the President was not inclined to call an extra session. The late\r\nrebel chieftains were pressing for the political rehabilitation of\r\ntheir section, and the President now fully believed that he had the\r\npower to proceed with the problem of Reconstruction, and was inclined\r\nto do so.\r\n\r\n{33} [Sidenote: Johnson's Amnesty Proclamation of May 29, 1865.]\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of May, he issued his proclamation of amnesty and pardon to\r\nall persons who, having engaged in rebellion, had failed to take the\r\nbenefits of Mr. Lincoln's proclamations of December 8, 1863, and March\r\n26, 1864. To all such persons Mr. Johnson offered his pardon upon their\r\ntaking an oath of the following tenor: \"I ---- do solemnly swear (or\r\naffirm) in the presence of Almighty God, that I will henceforth\r\nfaithfully support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United\r\nStates and the Union of the States thereunder, and that I will in like\r\nmanner abide by and faithfully support all laws and proclamations which\r\nhave been made during the existing rebellion with reference to the\r\nemancipation of slaves. So help me God.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The excepted classes.]\r\n\r\nHe, however, excepted the following classes of persons from the\r\nbenefits of the offer: 1st. Those who held or had held, under the\r\npretended Confederate Government, civil or diplomatic office or agency,\r\nor military office above the rank of colonel in the army and lieutenant\r\nin the navy, or military or naval office of any grade, if educated by\r\nthe United States Government in the Military Academy at West Point or\r\nthe United States Naval Academy; and all those who held, or had held,\r\nthe pretended office of Governor of a \"State\" in insurrection against\r\nthe United States;\r\n\r\n2d. Those who had left seats in the Congress of the United States or\r\njudicial stations under the United States to aid in the rebellion\r\nagainst the United States, and those who had resigned or tendered\r\nresignations of their commissions in the army or navy of the United\r\nStates to evade duty in resisting the rebellion;\r\n\r\n3d. Those who had, in any way, treated persons found in the service of\r\nthe United States, in any capacity, otherwise than lawfully as\r\nprisoners of war;\r\n\r\n{34} 4th. Those who had been engaged in destroying the commerce of the\r\nUnited States on the high seas, or upon the lakes and rivers separating\r\nthe British Provinces from the United States, or in making raids from\r\nCanada into the United States;\r\n\r\n5th. Those who were, or had been, absent from the United States, or had\r\nleft their homes within the jurisdiction of the United States, and\r\npassed beyond the military lines of the United States into the\r\npretended Confederate States, for the purpose of aiding the rebellion;\r\n\r\n6th. Those who, at the time they might seek to obtain the benefits of\r\nthe proclamation by taking the oath, were prisoners of war, or under\r\ncivil or criminal arrest, and those who had taken the oath of\r\nallegiance to the United States since December 8, 1863, and had failed\r\nto keep it;\r\n\r\nAnd, finally, those who had voluntarily participated in any way in the\r\nrebellion and were the owners of taxable property to the value of more\r\nthan twenty thousand dollars.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The effect of these exceptions.]\r\n\r\nThese exceptions would have shut out almost all of the leading men of\r\nmost of the \"States\" that passed secession ordinances from the benefits\r\nof the proclamation, except for the subsequent provision in the\r\nproclamation, which ordained that special application might be made to\r\nthe President for pardon by any person belonging to the excepted\r\nclasses, and held out the promise that such clemency would be as\r\nliberally extended as might be consistent with the facts of the case\r\nand the peace and dignity of the United States.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The President's plan in a sentence.]\r\n\r\nBriefly, the President proposed to pardon the rebel leaders, upon\r\nspecial personal application, as an act of high executive grace, and to\r\namnesty every one else in a body; and upon the basis of {35} their\r\nre-established loyalty to use the old electorate of the South in\r\nreconstruction. How he succeeded we will now proceed to relate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The realization of it.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The administering of the oath.]\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the machinery for administering the cleansing oath\r\nwas made very simple and accessible. Any commissioned officer, civil,\r\nmilitary or naval, of the United States, and any officer, civil or\r\nmilitary, of a loyal \"State\" qualified by the laws of the \"State\" to\r\nadminister oaths, was declared by the President, through his Secretary\r\nof State, to be competent to administer this oath of loyalty, a copy of\r\nwhich should be given to the person taking it as his certificate of\r\nrestored citizenship, and another copy sent to the State Department at\r\nWashington to be there deposited and kept in the archives of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reconstruction in North Carolina.]\r\n\r\nIn the second place, and by a second proclamation, issued on the same\r\nday, May 29th, the President appointed a Provisional Governor for North\r\nCarolina, and authorized and commanded him to cause the election of\r\ndelegates to, and their assembly in, a constitutional convention of the\r\n\"State\" for the reconstruction of the \"State,\" and its restoration to\r\nits constitutional relations to the United States. The electorate to be\r\nemployed by the Provisional Governor should be those persons who were\r\nqualified to vote by the laws of North Carolina in force immediately\r\nbefore the 20th of May, 1861, and had taken the oath prescribed in the\r\nfirst proclamation.\r\n\r\nThis second proclamation also commanded the heads of the departments of\r\nthe United States Government to put the laws of the United States into\r\noperation in North Carolina, the United States judges to open the\r\nUnited States courts and proceed to business, and the military officers\r\nin the district to aid the Provisional {36} Governor in carrying the\r\nduties assigned to him into effect, and to abstain from hindering,\r\nimpeding, or discouraging, in any manner, the organization of a \"State\"\r\ngovernment as authorized by the proclamation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The identity of Johnson's plan with that of Lincoln.]\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that Mr. Johnson's plan of Reconstruction was in\r\nsubstance the same as that of Mr. Lincoln. It rested upon the theory of\r\nthe indestructibility of the \"States,\" their perdurance as \"States\"\r\nthroughout the period of rebellion, the commission of treason and\r\nrebellion by combinations of private persons, the right of the\r\nExecutive to withdraw his military powers and put his civil powers in\r\noperation, whenever, in his judgment, the circumstances would warrant\r\nhim in so doing, and his authority to recognize the old electorates of\r\nthe \"States\" in which rebellion had existed as the respective\r\nconstituent bodies of the \"States,\" upon such terms and under such\r\nlimitations as he might prescribe. He did not lay down any rule as to\r\nthe numerical proportion which the modified electorates should bear to\r\nthe old, in order to make their acts legitimate, as Mr. Lincoln did;\r\nand he did declare in his second proclamation that the North Carolina\r\nconvention, when convened, or the legislature that might be thereafter\r\nassembled, should prescribe the qualification of electors, and the\r\neligibility of persons to hold office under the constitution and laws\r\nof the \"State,\" which Mr. Lincoln did not do in his proclamation. But\r\nthere is no doubt that Mr. Lincoln would have indorsed this\r\nproposition. He could not have avoided it, while holding the theory\r\nthat North Carolina was a \"State\" simply engaged in amending its\r\nconstitution, the theory which his own proclamation apparently set up.\r\nIn a word Johnson's policy and acts in reconstructing the \"States\" in\r\nwhich secession ordinances had been passed, and rebellion committed,\r\nwere {37} but a continuation of those of Mr. Lincoln. If Lincoln was\r\nright so was Johnson, and _vice versa_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reconstruction in Mississippi, Georgia, Alabama, South\r\nCarolina and Florida.]\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of June, the President issued a proclamation of like tenor\r\nand containing similar orders for putting the laws of the United States\r\ninto operation, and for putting similar machinery in motion for\r\nreconstruction, in Mississippi. He appointed William L. Sharkey\r\nProvisional Governor therein. On the 17th of June, similar steps were\r\ntaken for the reconstruction of Georgia, with James Johnson as the\r\nProvisional Governor; on the 21st of June for the reconstruction of\r\nAlabama, with Lewis E. Parsons as Provisional Governor; on the 30th of\r\nJune for the reconstruction of South Carolina, with Benjamin F. Perry\r\nas Provisional Governor; and on the 13th of July for the reconstruction\r\nof Florida, with William Marvin as Provisional Governor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reconstruction in Virginia.]\r\n\r\nAlready on May 9th, twenty days before the issue of his proclamation of\r\namnesty, the President had issued an executive order putting the laws\r\nof the United States in operation in Virginia, and guaranteeing the\r\nsupport of the United States Government to Governor Francis H. Pierpont\r\nin all lawful measures for the extension and administration of the\r\n\"State\" government throughout the geographical limits of Virginia. This\r\nmeant, of course, that the United States Government recognized the\r\nshadowy loyal \"State\" government, which had kept up at least a show of\r\nexistence throughout the rebellion, as the true \"State\" government of\r\nVirginia, and that Virginia did not need reconstruction, but only the\r\nextension of the authority of this government throughout her\r\nterritorial limits. This was, also, a simple continuation of Mr.\r\nLincoln's policy, as we well know.\r\n\r\n{38} [Sidenote: Reconstruction in Louisiana, Arkansas and Tennessee.]\r\n\r\nOf course Mr. Johnson recognized the reconstruction of Louisiana,\r\nArkansas and Tennessee as effected by Mr. Lincoln; so that by\r\nmid-summer of 1865 the reconstruction of all the \"States\" which had\r\npassed secession ordinances, except only Texas, had been completed, or\r\nhad been put in course of completion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The constitutional conventions of 1865.]\r\n\r\nDuring the summer, autumn and early winter of 1865, the Provisional\r\nGovernors of Mississippi, Alabama, South Carolina, North Carolina,\r\nGeorgia, and Florida ordered elections for the choosing of delegates to\r\nconstitutional conventions, upon the basis of the old suffrage laws of\r\nthe respective \"States\" once answering to these names, modified by the\r\nrequirements of the Presidential pardon, received after taking the oath\r\nof allegiance; and these elections were held and these conventions\r\nassembled.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The form of the work done in these conventions, and its\r\nsubstance.]\r\n\r\nThese bodies chose to do their work in the form of amendments to the\r\nold constitutions of the \"States,\" whose constituent powers they\r\nassumed to hold, rather than in the form of new constitutions. Before\r\nthe meeting of Congress on the first Monday of December, they had all\r\npassed ordinances, either repealing the secession ordinances of their\r\nrespective \"States,\" or pronouncing them null and void; had all voted\r\namendments to the constitutions of their respective \"States\" abolishing\r\nslavery; and all, except Mississippi and South Carolina, had passed\r\nordinances repudiating the debt incurred by their respective \"States\"\r\nin aid of rebellion against the United States.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The erection of \"State\" governments and the election of\r\nMembers of Congress.]\r\n\r\nBefore the meeting of Congress also, elections of the members of the\r\nrespective \"State\" legislatures and of \"State\" officers, and of the\r\nmembers of the House of Representatives in Congress, had been held by\r\nthe {39} Provisional Governors, under the direction of the respective\r\nconventions. And, finally, before the assembly of Congress, these\r\nLegislatures had, with the exception of that of Florida, met,\r\norganized, and elected United States Senators, and, with the exception\r\nof those of Florida and Mississippi, had adopted the Thirteenth\r\nAmendment to the Constitution. The legislature of Florida, not having\r\nmet and organized, had not at that date been able to consider the\r\nAmendment. It met on December 18th and elected United States Senators,\r\nand adopted the Thirteenth Amendment on the 28th. The legislature of\r\nMississippi, on the other hand, rejected the Thirteenth Amendment on\r\nthe 27th of November.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The orders of the President putting the civil Government of\r\nthe United States into operation everywhere.]\r\n\r\nDuring the same period, the President had by his several proclamations\r\nand orders declared the cessation of armed resistance, the restoration\r\nof intercourse throughout the country, and the raising of the blockade\r\nand the opening of the ports, and had put the different branches of the\r\ncivil Government of the United States into operation in all the\r\n\"States\" which had been the scene of the recent rebellion. He had not,\r\nhowever, restored the privilege of the writ of Habeas Corpus in these\r\nregions or in the District of Columbia, and he reserved the right to\r\nhave recourse to military control therein in case of necessity. The\r\nGovernors of South Carolina, Georgia, Mississippi and Florida under the\r\nConfederacy had, in the spring of 1865, assumed to summon the\r\nlegislatures, chosen by these \"States\" while members, or pretended\r\nmembers, of the Confederacy, to meet together for reconstruction\r\npurposes. The President had, through his military officials, ignored\r\nand prevented all such movements. No farther resistance to his plan of\r\nReconstruction had been attempted, but he saw {40} plainly that,\r\nwithout the United States military power to sustain the new \"State\"\r\ngovernments, there might be.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The President's first annual Message.]\r\n\r\nThis was the situation when Congress met on the first Monday of\r\nDecember, and received President Johnson's first annual Message. This\r\ndocument contained a disquisition upon the political system of the\r\nUnited States, as \"an indissoluble union of indestructible States,\"\r\nwith the natural conclusion that by attempting secession, the \"States\"\r\nimpaired, but did not extinguish, their vitality, suspended, but did\r\nnot destroy, their functions. It then proceeded with a narration of the\r\nfacts above stated, in which the President sought to establish, upon\r\nthe basis of his power to pardon and withdraw military rule, and to\r\nguarantee a republican form of government to every \"State,\" his\r\nauthority to reconstruct \"State\" government, or at any rate to permit\r\nthe pardoned citizens to do so under his direction.\r\n\r\nFinally, this paper contained the official notice to Congress that the\r\nPresident had admitted the reconstructed \"States\"--and that would mean\r\nall that had passed the secession ordinance, except perhaps Texas,\r\nwhose convention did not assemble until March of 1866--to participate\r\nin amending the Constitution of the United States. The President\r\nconcluded his narration and argumentation upon this all-important\r\nsubject in these words: \"The amendment to the Constitution being\r\nadopted, it will remain for the States whose powers have been so long\r\nin abeyance to resume their places in the two branches of the National\r\nLegislature, and thereby complete the work of restoration. Here it is\r\nfor you, fellow citizens of the Senate, and for you, fellow citizens of\r\nthe House of Representatives, to judge, each of you for yourselves, of\r\nthe elections, returns and qualifications of your own members.\"\r\n\r\n{41} It is entirely evident from all this that the President denied the\r\npower of the Houses of Congress, either separately or jointly, to\r\nprevent the Senators and Representatives from the reconstructed\r\n\"States\" from taking their seats upon any other grounds than defects in\r\nthe election and return, or in the personal qualifications, of the\r\nparticular persons under consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{42}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE CONGRESSIONAL PLAN OF RECONSTRUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Stevens Resolution--Legislation of the Reconstructed \"States\"\r\nConcerning the Status of the Freedmen, and the Freedmen's\r\nBureau--Vagrancy, Apprenticeship, and Civil Rights in the Reconstructed\r\n\"States\"--The View Taken of this Legislation by the Republicans--The\r\nRatification of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution--The\r\nDemand of the Senators- and Representatives-elect from the\r\nReconstructed \"States\" to be Admitted to Seats in Congress--The Joint\r\nCommittee of the Two Houses of Congress on Reconstruction--Thaddeus\r\nStevens's Ideas on Reconstruction--Mr. Shellabarger's Theory of\r\nReconstruction--Mr. Sumner's Theory of Reconstruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Stevens resolution.]\r\n\r\nSo soon as the House of Representatives had elected its Speaker, Mr.\r\nColfax, and other officers, and before the reception of the President's\r\nMessage, Mr. Thaddeus Stevens presented a resolution which proposed the\r\nselection of a joint committee of the House and Senate to inquire into\r\nthe condition of the \"States,\" which formed the so-called Confederate\r\nStates, and to report by bill or otherwise, whether, in the judgment of\r\nthe Committee, these \"States,\" or any of them, were entitled to be\r\nrepresented in either House of Congress, and which provided that \"until\r\nsuch report shall have been made and finally acted upon by Congress, no\r\nmember shall be received into either House from any of the so-called\r\nConfederate {43} States.\" The House passed this resolution by an\r\noverwhelming majority; and then adjourned without allowing a motion by\r\nMr. Niblack of Indiana, to the effect that \"pending the question as to\r\nthe admission of persons claiming to have been elected representatives\r\nto the present Congress from the States lately in rebellion, such\r\npersons be entitled to the privileges of the floor of the House,\" the\r\nusual privilege accorded contestants, to come to a vote.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The view of the House that Reconstruction could not be\r\neffected by the Executive.]\r\n\r\nThe view of the House was thus manifest from the start. It was that\r\nReconstruction could not be effected by the Executive Department of the\r\nGovernment, but was a problem for Congress, and that this was a matter\r\nentirely separate from the power of each House to judge of the\r\nelections, returns and qualifications of its members, a matter to be\r\ndecided by the whole Congress prior to the consideration of the\r\nquestion of the elections, returns, and qualifications of the members\r\nof each House. In a word, it was the question of the admission, or the\r\nreadmission, of \"States\" into the Union, or more correctly the question\r\nof the establishment or re-establishment of the \"State\" system of local\r\ngovernment upon territory of the United States under the exclusive\r\npower of the central Government.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Passage of the Stevens resolution as a concurrent\r\nresolution.]\r\n\r\nThere is no question that in sound political science the House was\r\nentirely correct in its theory, and that the objection of the Senate to\r\nthat part of the Stevens resolution which provided that no member\r\nshould be received into either House from any of the so-called\r\nConfederate States until the report of the Committee on Reconstruction\r\nshould have been finally acted on by Congress, as trenching upon the\r\nexclusive power of the Senate to judge of the elections, returns and\r\nqualifications of its members, rested upon a confounding of the {44}\r\nfunction of Congress to admit \"States\" into the Union with the power of\r\neach House to judge of the elections, returns and qualifications of\r\nthose claiming to represent \"States\" or constituencies in \"States\"\r\nabout whose position in the Union there was no question. The Senate\r\nfinally swung into line, however, by passing this part of the House\r\nresolution as a concurrent resolution instead of as a joint resolution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Legislation of the reconstructed \"States\" concerning the\r\nstatus of the freedmen, and the Freedmen's Bureau.]\r\n\r\nThere were two other considerations which moved the Republicans in\r\nCongress to assume this attitude in regard to Reconstruction. One was\r\nthe legislation of the \"States\" reconstructed by the President\r\nconcerning the status and the rights of the freedmen. On the 3d of\r\nMarch preceding, Congress had passed an act organizing a bureau in the\r\nWar Department for the care of refugees and freedmen in the districts\r\nin rebellion or in the territory embraced in the operations of the\r\narmy. This bureau was officered by a chief commissioner and assistant\r\ncommissioners for each of the \"States\" declared to be in insurrection.\r\nThese officers were authorized to take possession of the abandoned\r\nlands within these \"States,\" and other lands belonging to the United\r\nStates, and parcel them out to the loyal male refugees and freedmen,\r\nnot more than forty acres to each, and protect them in the use and\r\nenjoyment of the same for the term of three years. They were also\r\nauthorized to issue under the direction of the Secretary of War\r\nprovisions, clothing and fuel to such loyal refugees and freedmen as\r\nwere destitute.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The administration of the Freedmen's Bureau.]\r\n\r\nThere is no question that this was a most humane measure. It would have\r\nbeen a moral outrage for the Government of the United States to have\r\ntaken the slaves away from the support and protection accorded {45}\r\nthem by their masters, and to have thrown them upon their own resources\r\nwithout any means of sustenance during the transition into the new\r\nstatus. But there is also no question that this measure was so\r\nadministered as to do the race for whose benefit it was intended almost\r\nas much harm as good. When the Government began to furnish them with\r\nfood, clothes, fuel and shelter gratis, they, like the children that\r\nthey were, conceived of this, to them, very agreeable state of things\r\nas something that was to last forever, as the New Jerusalem. They\r\ngathered about the depots of the Freedmen's Bureau and could not be\r\ninduced to go away in search of work or livelihood. The belief became\r\nquite general that the Government intended to give every man forty\r\nacres of land and a mule, and otherwise to support him permanently. The\r\ndanger was that the newly emancipated would quit work altogether and\r\nthrow themselves entirely upon the charity of the United States\r\nGovernment. Many did do so, and formed thus a sort of privileged class\r\nthroughout the whole South under the special protection of the\r\nGovernment of the United States.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Vagrancy, apprenticeship and civil rights in the\r\nreconstructed \"States.\"]\r\n\r\nWhen, now, the newly reorganized \"States\" came to assume jurisdiction\r\nover matters concerning the freedmen, they found themselves driven to\r\nsome legislation to prevent the whole negro race from becoming paupers\r\nand criminals. It was in the face of such a situation that the\r\nlegislatures of these \"States\" passed laws concerning apprenticeship,\r\nvagrancy and civil rights, which were looked upon at the North as\r\nattempts to re-enslave the newly emancipated, and served to bring the\r\nnew \"State\" governments at the South into deep reproach.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Examination of these vagrancy acts, etc.]\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered, however, that at the time of the passage of the\r\nStevens resolution by the House of {46} Representatives, only two of\r\nMr. Johnson's reconstructed \"States\" had passed any laws upon these\r\nsubjects. These two were Mississippi and South Carolina; and a close\r\nexamination of the text of these enactments will hardly justify the\r\ninterpretations placed upon them by the radical Republicans. The South\r\nCarolina Preliminary Act came first in the order of time. It provided\r\nthat \"all free negroes, mulattoes, and mestizos, all freedwomen, and\r\nall descendants through either sex of any of these persons, shall be\r\nknown as _persons of color_, except that every such descendant, who may\r\nhave of Caucasian blood seven-eighths, or more, shall be deemed a white\r\nperson; that the statutes and regulations concerning slaves are now\r\ninapplicable to persons of color; and although such persons are not\r\nentitled to social or political equality with white persons, they shall\r\nhave the right to acquire, own, and dispose of property, to make\r\ncontracts, to enjoy the fruits of their labor, to sue and be sued, and\r\nto receive protection under the law in their persons and property\"; and\r\n\"that all rights and remedies respecting persons or property, and all\r\nduties and liabilities under laws civil and criminal, which apply to\r\nwhite persons, are extended to persons of color, subject to the\r\nmodifications made by this act and the other acts hereinbefore\r\nmentioned.\"\r\n\r\nThe acts to which this one was preliminary were not passed until the\r\nlatter half of December, and could not have served, except by\r\nprevision, as grounds for the Stevens resolution. Moreover there was\r\nlittle in this Act which was really calculated to arouse any pronounced\r\nhostility at the North. It evidently recognized the emancipation of the\r\nformer slaves, and the prohibition of future slavery, as fixed facts,\r\nand provided for substantial equality in civil rights between persons\r\nof color {47} and white persons. The discriminations which it referred\r\nto, rather than made, were those of a social and political nature,\r\nmatters which to that time had been controlled, if controlled at all,\r\nwholly by the \"States,\" except of course in those parts of the country\r\nin which \"States\" had not been erected.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Mississippi Acts.]\r\n\r\nThe Mississippi acts were all passed in November. They were the acts\r\nwhich were before the view of Congress and the country in the beginning\r\nof December, 1865, and, with the exception of the South Carolina\r\nPreliminary Act just commented on, the only ones. They require,\r\ntherefore, a somewhat fuller treatment. They consist of \"An Act to\r\nregulate the relation of master and apprentice relative to Freedmen,\r\nFree Negroes, and Mulattoes, passed November 22, 1865\"; the \"Vagrant\r\nAct of November 24, 1865\"; an \"Act to Confer Civil Rights on Freedmen\r\nand for other purposes,\" passed November 25, 1865; a supplementary Act\r\nto this, passed November 29, 1865; and another supplementary Act,\r\npassed December 2, 1865.\r\n\r\nThe first Act provided that freedmen, free negroes, and mulattoes under\r\nthe age of eighteen years, being orphans, or the children of parents\r\nwho could not, or would not, support them, should be apprenticed by the\r\nclerk of the Probate court in the county where found to competent and\r\nsuitable persons, and on such terms as the court should direct; under\r\nthe restrictions, that the former owner of the minor should be selected\r\nby the court as the master or mistress if, in the judgment of the\r\ncourt, he or she were competent and suitable; that the terms fixed by\r\nthe court should have the interest of the minor particularly in view;\r\nand that the apprentice should be bound by indenture, to run, in the\r\ncase of males, until the completion of the twenty-first year, {48} and,\r\nin the case of females, until the completion of the eighteenth year.\r\n\r\nThis Act further provided that in the management and control of\r\napprentices, the master or mistress should \"have power to inflict such\r\nmoderate corporal chastisement as a father or guardian is allowed to\r\ninflict on his or her child or ward at common law,\" but that in no case\r\nshould \"cruel or inhuman punishment be inflicted.\"\r\n\r\nIt furthermore provided, that in case of desertion by the apprentice,\r\nhe might be apprehended and brought before a justice of the peace, who\r\nmight remand him to his master or mistress, and might, on the refusal\r\nof the apprentice to return, commit him to jail, on failure to give\r\nbond, until the next term of the County court, which court should\r\ninquire into the matter, and determine whether the apprentice had left\r\nthe service to which he was bound without good cause or not, and\r\nshould, in the one case, compel the return to service by ordering the\r\ninfliction of the necessary penalties, and in the other, should order\r\nthe discharge of the apprentice, and enter \"judgment against the master\r\nor mistress for not more than one hundred dollars, for the use and\r\nbenefit of the apprentice.\"\r\n\r\nThe second Act provided, that \"all free negroes and freedmen in the\r\nState, over the age of eighteen years, found on the second Monday in\r\nJanuary, 1866, or thereafter, with no lawful employment or business, or\r\nfound unlawfully assembling themselves together, either in the day or\r\nnight time, and all white persons so assembling with freedmen, free\r\nnegroes, or mulattoes, or usually associating with freedmen, free\r\nnegroes, or mulattoes on terms of equality, or living in adultery or\r\nfornication with a freedwoman, free negro or mulatto, shall be deemed\r\nvagrants, and on conviction thereof, shall be {49} fined in the sum of\r\nnot exceeding, in the case of a freedman, free negro or mulatto, fifty\r\ndollars, and in the case of a white man, two hundred dollars, and\r\nimprisoned, at the discretion of the court, the free negro not\r\nexceeding ten days, and the white man not exceeding six months.\"\r\n\r\nIt further provided, that in case the freedman, free negro or mulatto\r\nshould not pay the fine within five days from the time of its\r\ninfliction, the sheriff of the proper county should hire him or her out\r\nto any person who would for the shortest period of service pay the fine\r\nand all costs, giving the preference, however, to the employer of the\r\nfreedman, negro or mulatto, if there should be any, and, if no person\r\nwould hire the same, should hold him or her to be dealt with as a\r\npauper. It also provided that the freedman, free negro, or mulatto\r\nrefusing or failing to pay a tax should be dealt with by the sheriff in\r\nthe same manner.\r\n\r\nAnd it provided, finally, that the same duties and liabilities existing\r\namong white persons in the \"State\" to support indigent whites should\r\nattach to freedmen, free negroes and mulattoes in regard to the support\r\nof colored paupers, and that in order to carry out the same a poll tax,\r\nnot exceeding one dollar a head, should be levied on every freedman,\r\nfree negro, and mulatto, between the ages of eighteen and sixty years,\r\nand should be collected and paid into the hands of the treasurers of\r\nthe counties to be used in the support of colored paupers.\r\n\r\nThe third Act provided, that freedmen, free negroes and mulattoes might\r\nacquire, hold, and dispose of, personal property in the same manner and\r\nto the same extent as white persons, and might sue and be sued in all\r\nthe courts of the \"State\" as white persons, but that they should not\r\nrent or lease lands or tenements except in {50} incorporated towns or\r\ncities, and under the control of the corporate authorities.\r\n\r\nIt provided, further, for the intermarriage of freedmen, free negroes\r\nand mulattoes, and for the legalization of all previous and existing\r\ncohabitations between them, and the legitimation of the issue\r\ntherefrom; but it forbade intermarriage between them and white persons,\r\nunder penalty of life imprisonment, and it defined freedmen, free\r\nnegroes and mulattoes as comprehending all of pure negro blood, and all\r\ndescended from negroes to the third generation inclusive, although one\r\nparent in each generation should have been white.\r\n\r\nIt provided, further, that freedmen, free negroes and mulattoes should\r\nbe competent as witnesses in all civil cases, in which they themselves\r\nor other freedmen, free negroes and mulattoes were parties or a party\r\nto the suit, and in criminal cases where the crime charged was alleged\r\nto have been committed by a white person or persons upon or against the\r\nperson or property of a freedman, free negro, or mulatto.\r\n\r\nIt provided, further, that every freedman, free negro and mulatto\r\nshould have a lawful home and employment, and should have written\r\nevidence thereof in the form of a license from the police authorities\r\nto do irregular or job work, or in the form of a written contract for\r\nlabor. It required that all contracts made with freedmen, free negroes\r\nand mulattoes for labor for a longer period than one month should be in\r\nwriting, a copy of which should be furnished to each party, and that if\r\nthe laborer should quit the service of the employer before the\r\nexpiration of the term fixed in the contract, he should forfeit his\r\nwages for that year up to the time of quitting.\r\n\r\nIt provided, further, for the arrest of any freedman, free negro, or\r\nmulatto quitting the service of an employer, and for the determination\r\nof the question whether {51} the quitting was for good cause or not,\r\nand for the disposition to be made of the deserter.\r\n\r\nIt provided, further, that enticing or persuading freedmen, free\r\nnegroes or mulattoes to desert from their legal employment, or\r\nemploying deserters from contract labor knowingly, or giving or selling\r\nthem food, raiment or other thing knowingly, should be a misdemeanor\r\npunishable by fine, or by imprisonment in case the fine should not be\r\npaid.\r\n\r\nIt provided, further, that no freedman, free negro or mulatto, unless\r\nin the military service of the United States, or licensed thereto by\r\nthe police authorities, should keep or carry arms, ammunition or\r\nmurderous weapons, and that every civil and military officer should\r\narrest any such person found in possession of such articles, and commit\r\nhim for trial.\r\n\r\nIt provided, further, that \"any freedman, free negro, or mulatto\r\ncommitting riots, affrays, trespasses, malicious mischief and cruel\r\ntreatment to animals, seditious speeches, insulting gestures, language\r\nor acts, or assaults on any person, disturbance of the peace, or\r\nexercising the functions of a minister of the gospel without a license\r\nfrom some regularly organized church, or selling spirituous or\r\nintoxicating liquors, or committing any other misdemeanor,\" should be\r\nfined or imprisoned, and, upon failure to pay the fine in five days'\r\ntime after conviction, should be publicly hired out to the person who\r\nwould pay the fine and costs for the shortest term of labor from the\r\nconvict.\r\n\r\nAnd it provided, finally, that \"all the penal and criminal laws now in\r\nforce in this State, defining offences, and prescribing the mode of\r\npunishment for crimes and misdemeanors committed by slaves, free\r\nnegroes or mulattoes, be and the same are hereby re-enacted, and\r\ndeclared to be in full force and effect, against {52} freedmen, free\r\nnegroes and mulattoes, except so far as the mode and manner of trial\r\nand punishment have been changed or altered by law.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Mississippi legislation a fair sample of the subsequent\r\nlegislation in other \"States.\"]\r\n\r\nThis is a fair sample of the legislation subsequently passed by all the\r\n\"States\" reconstructed under President Johnson's plan. In fact, in the\r\nlegislatures of several of them, bills containing substantially these\r\nprovisions were under consideration when Congress met, and it was fair\r\nto suppose that they would be enacted. Congress had thus in the first\r\nweek of December, 1865, substantially before it what the reconstructed\r\n\"States\" proposed to do in reference to the status and rights of the\r\nformer slaves, and in reference to the relations between the negro and\r\nthe white man in the future.\r\n\r\nAs yet, we must remember, the Thirteenth Amendment had not been\r\nproclaimed as adopted, in fact had not been adopted, on the basis of\r\nthe calculations of Mr. Seward, the Secretary of State, the officer who\r\nalone could proclaim adoption; and the abolition of slavery rested upon\r\nthe military power of the President, and on the acts of the \"States\"\r\nthemselves, the first of which is temporary as to its effects, and the\r\nsecond of which might be reversed by the \"States\" at pleasure.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The view taken of this legislation by the Republicans.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: This legislation from the point of view of natural justice.]\r\n\r\nThe Northern Republicans professed to see in this new legislation at\r\nthe South the virtual re-enslavement of the negroes. This was an\r\nextreme view of it, although it certainly did not give the negro equal\r\ncivil right with the white man, or anything approaching that, to say\r\nnothing of failing to offer him any prospects of ever participating in\r\npolitical functions. Of course it would be an abstract assumption to\r\nsay that the negro ought, at the moment of his emancipation, to have\r\nhad equal civil right with the white man. Civilized man can be safely\r\n{53} intrusted with a much larger civil liberty than the barbarian or\r\nthe semi-barbarian. There is no question also that much severer\r\npenalties for the commission of the same crime are necessary among a\r\nbarbarous race or class than among a civilized race or class. From\r\nthese points of view this Mississippi legislation does not appear as\r\nfar from what was natural and even necessary as Mr. Stevens and his\r\nfollowers made it out. The law of apprenticeship was not severe, and,\r\nif justly and sincerely executed, it would probably have been\r\nbeneficial to the young negroes, deprived of the care given them up to\r\nthat time by master or mistress, and now thrown upon themselves without\r\na cent of money or a particle of property, most of them knowing no\r\nparent except a mother as poor as themselves, and entirely unacquainted\r\nwith the new conditions of life now confronting them.\r\n\r\nThe law of vagrancy was severer. But it is easy to see that a\r\nreasonable execution of that law had as much help as harm in it for the\r\nformer slave. It would have preserved him against idleness,\r\ndrunkenness, and thievery, although it did curtail largely his liberty\r\nof action. It was, undeniably, the third act, which came so near to the\r\nre-enactment of the old slave code in regard to crimes and misdemeanors\r\ncommitted by negroes, that gave the greatest offence. Almost every act,\r\nword, or gesture of the negro, not consonant with good taste and good\r\nmanners, as well as good morals, was made a crime or misdemeanor, for\r\nwhich he could first be fined by the magistrates, and then consigned to\r\na condition almost of slavery for an indefinite time, if he could not\r\npay the fine. There is no question that the \"States\" of the Union had\r\nat that moment the power under the Constitution of the United States to\r\ndo these things. At that time the determination of the criminal law,\r\nboth {54} as to the definition of crime, the fixing of penalties, and\r\nthe fashioning of procedure, was almost entirely a function of the\r\n\"States,\" and there was no provision in the Constitution of the United\r\nStates which required the \"States\" to treat their own inhabitants with\r\nequality in regard to their civil rights and obligations.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances it is not at all surprising that the\r\nRepublicans of the North strongly felt that the freedom of the negro\r\nhad not yet been sufficiently guaranteed to render the acknowledgment\r\nof the resumption of \"State\"-powers by the communities so lately in\r\nrebellion against the United States for the upholding of negro slavery\r\nsafe and wise.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Correctness of the Republican position.]\r\n\r\nIt was certainly natural, and it was just and right, that the party in\r\npower in Congress should have considered it their duty to so amend the\r\nConstitution of the United States, before according \"State\"-powers to\r\nthe communities lately in rebellion, as to reap the just fruits of\r\ntheir triumph over secession and slavery. It was certainly their duty\r\nto the country to secure the adoption of the Thirteenth Amendment, and\r\nany further amendment, necessary to accomplish this result, before\r\nputting the recently rebellious communities in a position to defeat the\r\nsame. And it is certainly not strange that the Republicans should have\r\nfeared that the Democrats of the North in Congress would soon be found\r\nfraternizing with the Senators and Representatives from the\r\nreconstructed \"States,\" and that it was their duty to secure \"perpetual\r\nascendancy to the party of the Union,\" before admitting the Senators\r\nand Representatives from these \"States\" to participation in public\r\npower. Properly interpreted this only meant that loyal men must govern\r\nthe country. But it did not follow that only Republicans were loyal\r\nmen, and that the loyal Democrats of the North would follow {55} the\r\nrecently disloyal Democrats of the South in legislating upon the issues\r\nof the war. Republicans were likely to commit this fallacy in their\r\nreasoning. Many of them did commit it. And the result of it was to\r\nintensify partisanship at the expense of statesmanship.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment to the\r\nConstitution.]\r\n\r\nJust two weeks after the passage of the Stevens resolution by the House\r\nof Representatives, Mr. Seward announced the adoption of the Thirteenth\r\nAmendment to the Constitution of the United States. In making this\r\nannouncement, he declared that there were thirty-six \"States\" in the\r\nUnion, and that the legislatures of twenty-seven \"States,\" just\r\nthree-fourths, the necessary number, had voted its adoption; and among\r\nthose voting to adopt, he counted the legislatures of Virginia,\r\nLouisiana, Arkansas, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia\r\nand Alabama.\r\n\r\nIt is to be remarked, however, that had he counted none of the \"States\"\r\nthat had passed secession ordinances, either in the whole number, or in\r\nthe three-quarters necessary to adopt, the Amendment would in that case\r\nalso have been adopted. There would have been, in that case,\r\ntwenty-five \"States\" in the Union, and of these nineteen had adopted\r\nthe Amendment. And if any controversy had arisen over the use of\r\nfractions in making nineteen three-fourths of twenty-five, this would\r\nhave been quickly overcome by the fact that the legislatures of four\r\nmore of the loyal \"States\" adopted the Amendment soon after Mr.\r\nSeward's declaration, making twenty-three out of twenty-five. It will\r\nnot, of course, be disputed that, if the \"States\" that passed secession\r\nordinances should have been counted in arriving at the whole number of\r\n\"States\" in the Union, those of them adopting the Amendment should also\r\nhave been counted in making out the three-fourths majority {56}\r\nnecessary to adoption, and that if, on the other hand, they should have\r\nbeen excluded in arriving at the whole number, they should also have\r\nbeen excluded in making up the three-fourths majority. In other words,\r\nit does not matter from which point of view we regard the subject, the\r\nAmendment was regularly and lawfully adopted. It must be admitted,\r\nhowever, that Mr. Seward followed in this most solemn procedure, the\r\namending of the Constitution, the Presidential plan of Reconstruction,\r\nand gave great encouragement to the Senators- and Representatives-elect\r\nfrom these reconstructed \"States\" to expect that they would have the\r\naid and influence both of the Democrats in Congress, and of the\r\nAdministration, in securing their seats.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The demand of the Senators- and Representatives-elect from\r\nthe reconstructed \"States\" to be admitted to seats in Congress.]\r\n\r\nThey had gone to Washington and, bearing themselves confidently from\r\nthe first, they now became defiant in demanding their rights. Many of\r\nthem were men who, less than twelve months before, had been in arms\r\nagainst the United States, and one of them was the person who was the\r\nVice-President of the Confederacy at the moment of its downfall, Mr.\r\nAlexander H. Stephens. Such an attitude on his part and their part\r\nroused again great bitterness of feeling among the Republicans, many of\r\nwhom conscientiously thought that the real deserts of such persons were\r\nthe penalties of treason. Moreover, the legislatures of some of the\r\nother \"States\" reconstructed under the President's plan enacted, during\r\nDecember, January and February, measures concerning the status and\r\nrights of the emancipated slaves similar to those passed by the\r\nlegislature of Mississippi, and in some respects even more illiberal\r\nthan those passed by that body; and it was evident that all of them\r\nwould finally stand upon the same general ground in regard to this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n{57} This was the situation in the last week of February, 1866, when\r\nthe Senate passed a resolution, concurrent with the Stevens resolution\r\nin the House, denying seats to any of the claimants from the \"States\"\r\nlately in insurrection until the report of the Joint Committee on\r\nReconstruction should be made and finally acted upon. Four of the\r\nRepublican Senators, Messrs. Cowan, Doolittle, Dixon and Norton went\r\nagainst their party associates in this question, but there was still a\r\ntwo-thirds majority in both Houses resolute and resolved to combat the\r\nPresidential plan of Reconstruction and to construct and enforce a\r\nCongressional plan.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Joint Committee of the two houses of Congress on\r\nReconstruction.]\r\n\r\nAs we have already seen, the Senate had concurred with the House in\r\nregard to that part of the Stevens resolution which provided for the\r\nappointment of a Joint Committee on Reconstruction, at the time it was\r\npassed by the House. The members of the Committee were chosen soon\r\nafter the passage of this part of the Stevens resolution by the Senate.\r\nThey were, from the Senate, Messrs. Fessenden, Grimes, Harris, Howard,\r\nJohnson and Williams, all Republicans except Mr. Reverdy Johnson of\r\nMaryland, and from the House, Messrs. Bingham, Blow, Boutwell,\r\nConkling, Grider, Morrill, Rogers, Stevens and Washburne, all\r\nRepublicans except Grider of Kentucky and Rogers of New Jersey. The\r\nRepublicans had given themselves a larger representation on the\r\nCommittee than their numerical relation to the Democrats warranted, but\r\nthere is no reason to think that the report of the majority would have\r\nbeen in any respect different, if that relation had been more strictly\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The activity of Congress in the interim between the\r\nappointment of the Committee on Reconstruction and the Report of the\r\nCommittee.]\r\n\r\nThis Committee sat for about six months before making its final report.\r\nDuring this period, however, several propositions issued from it, and\r\ntwo great {58} measures of statute law were passed by Congress, all of\r\nwhich must be more nearly considered in order to keep the thread of the\r\nnarrative of Reconstruction. Moreover the debate upon the subject of\r\nReconstruction was at the same time in progress and the view of the\r\nsubject held by the leading Republicans was becoming more clear and\r\nfixed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Thaddeus Stevens's ideas on Reconstruction.]\r\n\r\nMr. Stevens opened this debate in the House on the 18th of December\r\n(1865). In a powerful speech, he developed anew his doctrine that the\r\nterritory once covered by the \"States,\" which had seceded from the\r\nUnion, was nothing now but a conquered district, whose future condition\r\ndepended upon the will of the conqueror. If \"States\" should ever be\r\nerected there again, it must be accomplished, he contended, by virtue\r\nof that provision in the Constitution which declares that \"new States\r\nmay be admitted by Congress into this Union.\" This theory involved the\r\nadmission that secession had been temporarily successful. This Mr.\r\nStevens frankly acknowledged. He said: \"Unless the law of nations is a\r\ndead letter, the late war between the two acknowledged belligerents\r\nsevered their original contracts, and broke all the ties that bound\r\nthem together.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Contradiction between Stevens's view and the view of the\r\nAdministration.]\r\n\r\nThis was the extreme doctrine on the one side. It was in blunt\r\ncontradiction to the doctrine upon which the Administration was acting,\r\nthe doctrine that the attempt at secession was entirely abortive, and\r\nthat the \"States\" where it was attempted were still in the Union _as\r\n\"States,\"_ and had never been anywhere else or anything else, in fact\r\ncould not be; that the rebellion was the work of private individuals\r\ncombined as truly against the real \"States\" in which it existed as\r\nagainst the {59} United States; and that, therefore, the overthrow of\r\nthese combinations and the cessation of the military rule of the\r\nPresident must be followed by the resumption on the part of the\r\n\"States\" concerned of all their rights and powers of local\r\nself-government and of participation in the United States Government,\r\nas guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States, unimpaired, and\r\nwithout any action whatever on the part of Congress. Mr. Raymond\r\nrepresented this view on the floor of the House of Representatives. He\r\nwas a Republican of the Seward school, and sympathized entirely with\r\nhis patron upon this subject. It was a great embarrassment to him that\r\nthe Democrats immediately gave in their adherence to this view. It\r\nhelped to prevent him from gaining any following at all for it among\r\nthe Republicans.\r\n\r\nBut while the Republicans of the House repudiated entirely Mr.\r\nRaymond's principles, the great mass of them were not able to accept\r\nMr. Stevens's view of the temporary validity of secession, and the\r\ntemporary existence of the Southern Confederacy as a foreign power.\r\nTheir feelings and instincts required a principle of reconstruction\r\nwhich, at the same time that it did not recognize secession as having\r\nany validity for the shortest moment, yet regarded the \"States\" in\r\nwhich it was attempted, as having thereby become something other than\r\n\"States\" of the Union, and as requiring the assent of Congress to the\r\nrightful resumption of that status.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Shellabarger's theory of Reconstruction.]\r\n\r\nIt was Mr. Shellabarger, of Ohio, who did more than anybody else to\r\ngive the proper logical interpretation to these feelings and invent the\r\ntheory of Reconstruction on which the Republicans could plant\r\nthemselves. Briefly stated that theory was that, while secession was a\r\nnullity legally from the beginning, and could not take the territory\r\n{60} occupied by the \"States\" attempting it, or the people inhabiting\r\nthat territory, out of the Union, or from under the rightful\r\njurisdiction of the United States Government and Constitution for one\r\ninstant, yet it worked the loss of the \"State\" status in the Union, and\r\nfrom a legal point of view left this territory and the inhabitants of\r\nit subject exclusively to the jurisdiction of the United States\r\nGovernment, a status from which they could be relieved only by the\r\nerection of \"States\" anew upon such territory, an operation which could\r\nbe effected, under the Constitution of the United States, only by the\r\nco-operation of Congress with the loyal inhabitants of such territory.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Sumner's theory of Reconstruction.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Republicans in Congress almost unanimously in favor of\r\nthe Shellabarger-Sumner plan.]\r\n\r\nThis was sound political science and correct constitutional law. It\r\ncould not fail to command the assent of the great majority of the\r\nRepublicans in the House and in the country. This same doctrine was, at\r\nthe same time, developed in the Senate by Mr. Sumner, Mr. Fessenden and\r\nMr. Wilson, and it was easy to see that it had become the theory of the\r\nRepublican party in Congress long before the final report of the\r\nCommittee on Reconstruction promulgated it. Even Stevens and his\r\nradical followers were in line with it in so far as practical results\r\nwere concerned. That is, the Republicans all stood together on the\r\nprinciple that Reconstruction could only be effected by Congressional\r\nacts, since it was tantamount to a conferring, or reconferring, of the\r\n\"State\" status upon a population at the moment subject to the exclusive\r\njurisdiction of the Government of the United States. This meant that\r\nthe entire Republican party in Congress, with the exception of the four\r\nmembers of the Senate already named, and of Mr. Raymond and one other\r\nin the House (and this constituted a majority of two-thirds in each\r\nHouse) would antagonize the plan of Executive Reconstruction {61}\r\ndevised by Lincoln and Seward and persisted in by Johnson and, to that\r\nmoment, by his cabinet. How far the Republicans in Congress would go in\r\nthe attempt to set aside Executive Reconstruction depended chiefly upon\r\nthe moderation of the President, and the sincerity of the people in the\r\nSouth. It depended also in some degree, to say the least, upon what\r\nwould be necessary to keep the Republican party, which conceived itself\r\nto be the only really loyal party to the Union, in power.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the Sumner-Shellabarger theory of Reconstruction\r\nwas correct. The only question was how exacting Congress would be in\r\nrealizing it. Under such a situation it behooved the President to act\r\nwith great caution and moderation, and to do nothing to provoke a\r\nconflict in which he was certain to be worsted. And it also behooved\r\nthe people of the South to make no opposition to the bestowal of a\r\nlarge measure of civil liberty upon the freedmen, nor to such an\r\nadjustment of the basis of political representation as would not\r\nnecessitate negro suffrage, and not to insist upon sending to Congress,\r\nat the outset, the men who had made themselves particularly obnoxious\r\nto loyal feeling. How both the President and the persons in authority\r\nat the South disregarded these considerations of prudence, and how the\r\nposition assumed by them upon these subjects drove Congress into more\r\nand more radical lines, is the further subject of the next three\r\nchapters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{62}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE CONGRESSIONAL PLAN (_Continued_)\r\n\r\nThe Freedmen Codes in the South--The Reports of Grant and Schurz in\r\nRegard to the Status in the South--The Freedmen's Bureau Bill of\r\n1866--The President's 22d of February Speech--The Civil Rights\r\nBill--The Veto of the Bill--The Veto Overridden--The Fourteenth\r\nAmendment--The Discussion of the Propositions in Congress--The\r\nPresident's Attitude toward the Proposed Amendment--Mr. Seward's Acts\r\nin Regard to Ratification--The Requirement that the Ratification of the\r\nProposed Amendment should be the Condition of the Admission of the\r\nSenators- and Representatives-elect to Seats in Congress--The Tennessee\r\nPrecedent.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Freedmen codes in the South.]\r\n\r\nWe have reviewed the acts of the new legislature of Mississippi\r\nconcerning the civil status of the freedmen. It is sufficient to say\r\nthat during the winter of 1865-66, the other reconstructed legislatures\r\nfollowed the example of the legislature of Mississippi. These movements\r\nforced upon the Republican party in Congress the conviction that the\r\ncivil rights of the freedmen must be secured by national law. As yet\r\nthere existed only the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution upon\r\nwhich to base Congressional statutes, and this, as we know, simply\r\nabolished and prohibited slavery and involuntary servitude, and\r\nempowered Congress to pass appropriate laws for the execution of the\r\nAmendment. By virtue of the war powers still exercised by the\r\nAdministration several of the Union Generals, as we shall see, had set\r\naside this legislation in {63} some of these reconstructed \"States.\"\r\nBut, of course, it was well understood that this was only a temporary\r\nremedy. During the month of January, 1866, the Republicans in Congress\r\nbecame convinced that the newly organized \"States,\" with the exception\r\nof Tennessee, were consciously developing freedmen's codes which would\r\nnot differ greatly from their old slave codes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The reports of Grant and Schurz in regard to the status in\r\nthe South.]\r\n\r\nThe President had sent General Grant and General Carl Schurz on tours\r\nof inspection and inquiry through the South, during the late summer and\r\nautumn of 1865; and Congress now asked the President to impart to it\r\nthe information thus gathered. The two reports were quite\r\ncontradictory. General Grant said that he drew the conclusion from his\r\nobservations that \"the mass of thinking men of the South accept the\r\npresent situation of affairs in good faith.\" He also indicated that the\r\nofficers of the Freedmen's Bureau were a useless set of men, dangerous\r\nto the peace and prosperity of the South, and recommended that the\r\nmilitary officers in the different districts should be put in charge of\r\nthe bureau.\r\n\r\nMr. Schurz, on the other hand, reported that his conclusions from his\r\nobservations were that there was no loyalty among the leaders and the\r\nmass of the people in the South, except such as consisted in submission\r\nto necessity; that they were consciously attempting in their new\r\nlegislation to establish a new form of slavery, distinct only from the\r\nold chattel slavery; and that this could be prevented only by national\r\nlaw and national control, at least for many years to come.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant's visit had been a flying one, and his inquiries upon the\r\nsubject were secondary only to his other business. On the other hand,\r\nGeneral Schurz had journeyed deliberately, and his inquiries were the\r\nchief, if not the sole, purpose of his visit. Moreover, {64} General\r\nSchurz was a keener observer in regard to such matters than General\r\nGrant, and a much better reasoner.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The attitude of Congress toward the reports.]\r\n\r\nDespite, therefore, the great popularity and influence of General\r\nGrant, Congress was inclined to place more credence in the report of\r\nGeneral Schurz. While its Committee on Reconstruction was deliberating,\r\nit, therefore, most naturally set itself about doing what it could,\r\nunder the Thirteenth Amendment, and also under its still existing war\r\npowers, in behalf of the civil rights of the freedmen.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Freedmen's Bureau bill of 1866.]\r\n\r\nThe first measure it attempted was one to enlarge the powers of the\r\nFreedmen's Bureau. This supplementary project originated with the\r\nJudiciary Committee of the Senate, and was presented in the Senate on\r\nthe 12th of January, 1866. The new bill proposed to increase the\r\npersonnel of the bureau and expand the powers vested in it as provided\r\nin the law of March 3d, 1865, in the following most important respects:\r\n\r\nFirst, While the law of March 3d, 1865, provided for the appointment of\r\na commissioner and ten assistants as the entire personnel of the\r\nBureau, the new bill authorized the appointment of a commissioner,\r\ntwelve assistant commissioners, and the appointment or detail of an\r\nagent for each county or parish throughout the section where the Bureau\r\nmight operate.\r\n\r\nSecond, While in the law of March 3d, 1865, the Bureau rather appeared\r\nto be under the civil administration of the President, the new bill\r\nplaced it distinctly under the military administration of the\r\nPresident, and authorized the President to extend \"military\r\njurisdiction and protection over all of the officers, agents, and\r\nemployees of the Bureau.\"\r\n\r\nThird, While the law of March 3d, 1865, confined the powers of the\r\nBureau to the giving of aid to {65} refugees and freedmen and the\r\ndistribution of abandoned and confiscated lands among them, the new\r\nbill proposed, in addition to this, to vest in the Bureau the power to\r\nbuild school houses and asylums for the freedmen, and the most\r\nwide-reaching jurisdiction over all civil and criminal cases where\r\nequality in civil rights and status, and in the application of\r\npenalties, was denied, or the denial thereof attempted, on account of\r\nrace, color, or previous condition of servitude; and it authorized\r\nmilitary protection in all such cases to be extended to the suffering\r\nparty. In a single sentence, this bill provided a sort of palatine\r\njurisdiction over the freedmen in the section lately the scene of\r\nrebellion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The passage of the bill.]\r\n\r\nIt was a stiff measure even for the transition period from war to\r\npeace. It cannot be justified constitutionally as anything but a war\r\nmeasure. It is true that the Thirteenth Amendment, just adopted, could\r\nbe interpreted as giving Congress the power to prohibit inequalities in\r\ncivil rights and in criminal punishments, as the incidents of slavery\r\nor involuntary servitude, and to extend the ordinary jurisdiction of\r\nthe constitutional courts of the United States over all cases where the\r\nattempt to apply such inequalities should be made. But it certainly did\r\nnot give Congress the power, under any ordinary circumstances, to\r\ncreate a new system of courts, subject to the Executive, officered by\r\nmilitary men, and armed directly with military power to enforce\r\ndecisions. It was, as has been said, a war measure, and nothing else.\r\nThe question was reduced simply to this: Ought the Congress of the\r\nUnited States to enact a new war measure, after armed resistance had\r\nceased everywhere, except perhaps in some parts of Texas? Was it sound\r\npolicy, was it good morals, to do so, when the people in the sections\r\nlately in rebellion were settling down into the pursuits of peace, even\r\nthough Congress might {66} legally have the right to do so? The bill\r\nwas debated long and carefully in the Senate by all of the leading\r\nmembers, and the opinion finally prevailed among them that it was a\r\nmeasure necessary to preserve and protect the freedom of the newly\r\nenfranchised. It passed the Senate by a vote of 37 to 10, and the House\r\nby a vote of 136 to 33.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The veto upon it.]\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of February (1866) it was sent to the President for his\r\nsignature. In a Message, dated the 19th of February, the President put\r\nhis veto upon this bill. The document was a strong and sound\r\npresentation of reasons for his dissent. He said he could not approve\r\nof a war measure, with an indefinite term, when the authority of the\r\nUnited States was not disputed in any part of the country, when the\r\nrebellion was at an end, and when the country had returned, or was\r\nreturning, to the pursuits of peace. He referred to the fact that the\r\nlaw of March 3d, 1865, was still in operation, and claimed that it\r\nfurnished him with all the extraordinary powers necessary to protect\r\nthe freedmen. He called attention to the army of officials which this\r\nproposed law would create, and to the enormous expense which it would\r\nentail. And he denied the constitutional power of the Government of the\r\nUnited States to assume functions for negroes which it had never been\r\nauthorized to assume for white men. There is little question now that\r\nthe President was correct about this matter, and that the Congress was\r\nboth reckless and aggressive, not to say vindictive. But it is\r\nquestionable whether the President did not himself lessen unnecessarily\r\nhis influence with his party in Congress, by his unqualified opposition\r\nto any strengthening of the measure of 1865. He might have returned the\r\nbill with the suggestion that it should have a definite limit as to the\r\ntime it should run, and have {67} expressed his willingness to sign a\r\nbill which should be so limited. Johnson was blunt in his honesty. But\r\nSeward was his adviser, and Seward was, above everything, politic. It\r\nwould seem that he either failed to advise with his usual sagacity in\r\nthis case, or that his advice was unheeded.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The veto effective.]\r\n\r\nFor this once the President's arguments convinced enough of the\r\nSenators to deprive the bill of the support of the necessary majority\r\nto carry it over his veto, even so stanch a Republican as ex-Governor\r\nMorgan of New York voting against the bill after its return. The\r\nRepublican majority was deeply chagrined, not to say discouraged, and\r\nthe President was injuriously encouraged to enter upon the struggle\r\nwith Congress over the question of Reconstruction.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The President's 22d of February speech.]\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 22d of February, three days after his successful\r\nveto, the President made a most important speech from the steps of the\r\nWhite House to a large popular meeting assembled to congratulate him\r\nupon his victory. He was betrayed by his elation and warmth into an\r\nabusive denunciation of his enemies, once, and only a few months\r\nbefore, his best friends. He went so far as to declare that Stevens and\r\nSumner and Phillips and others like them were, in his opinion, laboring\r\nas assiduously to destroy the fundamental principles of the government\r\nas were the leaders of the rebellion. After such an open challenge, the\r\ncontest was nearly unavoidable. It was not avoided, whatever might have\r\nbeen the possibilities of re-establishing harmony. And it cannot be\r\ndenied that, from this moment, personal rancor against the President\r\nfilled the heart of Stevens, at least, if not of the others. The\r\nPresident's utterances were, indeed, highly exasperating, and it would\r\nhave required a very large measure of public virtue to have ignored\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n{68} [Sidenote: The Civil Rights Bill.]\r\n\r\nAs a part of the same plan for securing the civil rights of the\r\nfreedmen against the hostile legislation of the President's\r\nreconstructed \"States,\" the Judiciary Committee of the Senate reported\r\na Civil Rights bill to the Senate one day before it reported the\r\nFreedmen's Bureau bill, that is, on the 11th of January. The right of\r\nway, so to speak, was, however, given to the latter bill, and Congress\r\nwas nearly two months longer in perfecting the former than the latter.\r\nThis Civil Rights bill certainly avoided many of the most serious\r\nobjections which could be truthfully made against the Freedmen's Bureau\r\nbill. It was not a war measure in a time of peace. It did not provide a\r\nprivileged jurisdiction for any class, and it did not create an army of\r\nnew officials to drain the Treasury and increase the patronage of the\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of it was simply to establish equality in the enjoyment of\r\ncivil rights for all citizens of the country and to make all persons\r\nborn in the country and not subject to any foreign power citizens. The\r\nsubstantial part of the bill, as perfected, read: \"All persons born in\r\nthe United States and not subject to any foreign power, excluding\r\nIndians not taxed, are hereby declared to be citizens of the United\r\nStates; and such citizens of every race and color, without regard to\r\nany previous condition of slavery or involuntary servitude, except as a\r\npunishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted,\r\nshall have the same right, in every State and Territory in the United\r\nStates, to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, and give\r\nevidence, to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and\r\npersonal property, and to the full and equal benefit of all laws and\r\nproceedings for the security of person and property, as is enjoyed by\r\nwhite citizens, and shall be subject to like punishment, pains and\r\npenalties, and to {69} none other, any law, statute, ordinance,\r\nregulation or custom, to the contrary notwithstanding.\"\r\n\r\nThis is simply equality for all before the law. It conferred no\r\npolitical privilege and no social equality. It was fairly within the\r\npower of Congress to pass such a measure, by interpreting broadly the\r\nThirteenth Amendment, without having any recourse to the idea of war\r\npowers. Slavery was nothing but extreme inequality in civil rights\r\nbetween master and servant. The prohibition of slavery and involuntary\r\nservitude could, therefore, most certainly be held to be the\r\nprohibition of all of these incidents.\r\n\r\nThe remaining provisions of the bill did nothing more than fix\r\npenalties for violating, or attempting to violate, civil equality as\r\nthus defined, designate the officers charged with the duty of\r\nprosecuting the offenders, and establish the jurisdiction for the trial\r\nof such cases.\r\n\r\nThe penalties were somewhat grave. They might be as severe as a fine of\r\none thousand dollars, or imprisonment for a year, or both, in the\r\ndiscretion of the courts. But they were not cruel or unusual, and were,\r\ntherefore, within the power of Congress to prescribe. The officers\r\nauthorized and required to institute proceedings against violators of\r\nthe law were the district attorneys, marshals and deputy marshals of\r\nthe United States courts, the commissioners appointed by the Circuit\r\nand Territorial courts of the United States, the officers and agents of\r\nthe Freedmen's Bureau, and every other officer whom the President might\r\nsee fit to empower thereto. And the jurisdiction established for the\r\ntrial of such cases was that of the United States courts, upon which\r\nwas conferred original and exclusive jurisdiction in any case under the\r\nlaw, and to which any case touching these subjects commenced in a\r\n\"State\" court could {70} be removed on motion of the defendant. But all\r\nthese things were authorized by a liberal construction of the\r\nThirteenth Amendment, which expressly vests in Congress the power to\r\nmake all laws necessary and proper to enforce the prohibition of\r\nslavery throughout the whole country.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The measure sound from the points of view of modern\r\njurisprudence and modern political science.]\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, a great change in the system of the jurisprudence of\r\nthe United States that the central Government should define and protect\r\ncivil equality within the States. But it was a change which history had\r\nforced upon the country, and the sovereign power of the nation had\r\ndeliberately legalized it. There is no question now that it was sound\r\npolitical science, too, and that it was required by public morality.\r\nReal civil liberty is always national. Its concepts and principles\r\nspring out of the national consciousness of rights and wrongs. And\r\ncivil equality is the first principle of modern justice, the most\r\npressing behest of the public morality of the age. Moreover, this\r\nmeasure did not militate against the President's plan of\r\nReconstruction. He could have accepted it without compromising that\r\nplan in the slightest, and it was a monumental blunder on his part that\r\nhe did not do so.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The veto of the bill.]\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of March, he sent his veto of the bill into the Senate. It\r\nwas a weak argument throughout. He objected to making the freedmen\r\ncitizens by an act of Congress, while eleven of the thirty-six \"States\"\r\nwere unrepresented in Congress, and made out that it was a\r\ndiscrimination in favor of the ignorant negro against the intelligent\r\nforeigner not yet naturalized. He objected to the extension of the\r\npowers of the central Government in behalf of civil equality within the\r\n\"States\" as destructive of the federal system of government, and as\r\ndegrading to the {71} legislators and officials of the \"States.\" He did\r\nnot deny that the proposed measure might be sustained as constitutional\r\nunder the Thirteenth Amendment, but maintained that it was unnecessary\r\nfor the execution of the provisions of the Amendment. He objected,\r\nfurther, to the number of officers and agents authorized to institute\r\nproceedings under the measure, to the fee which they should receive,\r\nand to the power of the President to order the courts of the United\r\nStates to migrate from one place to another when necessary for the\r\nprompt administration of justice. And he objected, finally, to the\r\npower vested in the President to use the land and naval forces and the\r\nmilitia to prevent the violation, and enforce the due execution, of the\r\nmeasure.\r\n\r\nNow all this was easily answered from the point of view which Congress\r\nand the North had now firmly taken, viz.: that the eleven former\r\n\"States\" in which rebellion had for so long prevailed were not\r\n\"States,\" although the territory formerly occupied by them, and the\r\npopulation formerly inhabiting them, were within the United States and\r\nwere subject to the jurisdiction of the central Government; that the\r\nrebellion had demonstrated that the central Government must be\r\nintrusted with a large increase of powers in protecting civil equality\r\nand civil liberty; and that the sovereign Nation had willed this in the\r\nenactment and adoption of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Criticism of the bill.]\r\n\r\nReally there was but one thing in the bill susceptible of successful\r\ncriticism, and that could be explained so as to avoid it. It was the\r\nninth section, which authorized the President to use military power in\r\nexecution of the law. The language would permit the President to use\r\nthe military before bringing the matter before the courts and securing\r\na decision. It would permit the President to use the military as the\r\n{72} primal, instead of the final, agency for executing the law. It\r\nappeared to be in this respect a real force bill, that is a bill in\r\nwhich the Executive is empowered to use the military, not for the\r\nenforcement of judicial decision in aid of the marshals, deputies,\r\nconstables, and their posses, which is the customary order in time of\r\npeace, but for the execution of the law in the first instance, before\r\ndecision rendered or trial had. But it was entirely clear that what was\r\nmeant in this section of the bill was that, when combinations too\r\npowerful to be dealt with by the courts and their officers should\r\nundertake to prevent the execution of the law, the President might use\r\nthe military to overcome them. Under such an interpretation, this\r\nprovision was justifiable and proper, certainly so in a transition\r\nperiod from a condition of general rebellion against the laws of the\r\nUnited States to that of gradual, and only gradual, acquiescence in\r\ntheir enforcement.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The President's blunder.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The veto overridden.]\r\n\r\nThe President most decidedly lost his chance of rehabilitating himself\r\nwith his party, and leading it in the work of Reconstruction, by not\r\nsigning this bill. He sinned against the Southerners themselves in not\r\ndoing so. His veto of it made them believe that they could count upon\r\nthe Administration, the Administration Republicans, and the whole\r\nDemocratic party of the North, in denying equal civil rights to the\r\nfreedmen, and that such a combination must eventually triumph. They,\r\ntherefore, persisted in their course of exceptional legislation against\r\nthe freedmen in the South, and in their arrogant demands for the\r\nimmediate admission to seats in Congress of the very men who had led\r\nthe rebellion for four years against the sovereignty and Government of\r\nthe United States. It is amazing that they did not see that the large\r\nRepublican majority in Congress would {73} be driven to the alternative\r\nof seeing the work of four years of terrible sacrifice undone or of\r\nsecuring its permanence by making such changes in the organic law as\r\nwould effect it, while yet they had the power. On the 6th of April, the\r\nSenate overrode the President's veto of the Civil Rights bill, and on\r\nthe 9th the House did likewise.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Fourteenth Amendment.]\r\n\r\nWhile, as we have seen, the President did not exactly deny the\r\nconstitutionality of the bill, the Democrats in Congress, and the\r\nSoutherners seeking seats in Congress, did. There was, therefore, but\r\none course left open to the Republican majority, and that was to make\r\nwhat they considered to be the incidents of the Thirteenth Amendment\r\nexpress provisions of the Constitution. There were also several other\r\nthings which had become clear in the course of the debates in the Civil\r\nRights bill and the Freedmen's Bureau bill.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it was seen that the emancipation of the slaves\r\nwould increase the representation in Congress and in the Presidential\r\nelectoral college from the old slave \"States\" by two-fifths whenever\r\nthe Southern communities should be recognized as \"States\" again, and\r\nthat too without the admission of the emancipated persons to the\r\nexercise of political suffrage. It was certainly to be apprehended\r\nthat, with such increased representation, the Southern members and the\r\nNorthern Democrats would constitute a majority in Congress and in the\r\nelectoral college, and might proceed not only to repeal the Civil\r\nRights Act, and all acts in behalf of the freedmen, but also to throw\r\nthe Confederate debt or a part of it upon the United States, or\r\nestablish pensions for Confederate soldiers, or even repudiate the debt\r\nof the Union made in defence of its own life. While the danger of these\r\nthings was, probably, somewhat {74} exaggerated, still it would not\r\nhave been becoming for men of prudence and patriotism to have failed to\r\nprovide against them. Really there was but one thing to do, and that\r\nwas to enact, and secure the adoption of, another amendment to the\r\nConstitution covering these points, while the power to do so still\r\nexisted.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The political provision in the proposed Fourteenth\r\nAmendment.]\r\n\r\nIt would be an agreeable thing to the writer of this period of American\r\nhistory, were he able to record that the principal matter which\r\noccupied the thought and attention of the Committee on Reconstruction\r\nwas how to secure the necessary civil rights of the freedmen. But in\r\nthe interest of exact truth he is compelled to forego this pleasure.\r\nThe first thing which that Committee considered and recommended to the\r\nHouses of Congress was the political matter of a redistribution of the\r\nrepresentation in the House of Representatives and in the Presidential\r\nelectoral college. On the 22d of January (1866) the Committee reported\r\nto the two Houses the following proposition as an amendment to the\r\nConstitution of the United States: \"Representatives and direct taxes\r\nshall be apportioned among the several States which may be included\r\nwithin this Union according to their respective numbers, counting the\r\nwhole number of persons in each State--excluding Indians not\r\ntaxed--provided, that whenever the elective franchise shall be denied\r\nor abridged in any State on account of race or color, all persons of\r\nsuch race or color shall be excluded from the basis of representation.\"\r\nFor nearly six weeks both the Committee and Congress were occupied in\r\nthe discussion of this proposition. In a slightly modified form it was\r\nadopted in the House, but, at last, on the 9th of March, it came to\r\nvote in the Senate, and not having received the necessary two-thirds\r\nmajority, it was abandoned as a separate measure, and {75} merged into\r\nthe general article containing the regulations of all the points to\r\nwhich reference was made above.\r\n\r\nIt was Monday, April 30th, before the Committee was ready to report the\r\nentire article, which took the name of the Fourteenth Amendment to the\r\nConstitution. The article as presented to the Houses of Congress by the\r\nJoint Committee on that day read as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Sect. 1. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge\r\nthe privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor\r\nshall any State deprive any person of life, liberty or property without\r\ndue process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the\r\nequal protection of the laws.\r\n\r\n\"Sect. 2. Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States\r\nwhich may be included within this Union according to their respective\r\nnumbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding\r\nIndians not taxed. But whenever in any State the elective franchise\r\nshall be denied to any portion of its male citizens not less than\r\ntwenty-one years of age, or in any way abridged, except for\r\nparticipation in rebellion or other crime, the basis of representation\r\nin such State shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of\r\nsuch male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens not\r\nless than twenty-one years of age.\r\n\r\n\"Sect. 3. Until the 4th day of July in the year 1870, all persons who\r\nvoluntarily adhered to the late insurrection, giving it aid and\r\ncomfort, shall be excluded from the right to vote for Representatives\r\nin Congress and for electors for President and Vice-President of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n\"Sect. 4. Neither the United States nor any State shall assume or pay\r\nany debt or obligation already incurred, or which may hereafter be\r\nincurred, in aid of {76} insurrection or war against the United States,\r\nor any claim for compensation for loss of involuntary service or labor.\r\n\r\n\"Sect. 5. The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate\r\nlegislation, the provisions of this Article.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Defects in the first draft of the Amendment.]\r\n\r\nThe chief difficulties with these provisions were, first, that they did\r\nnot define who were the citizens of the United States; second, that\r\nwhile they disfranchised for two or three years all who had voluntarily\r\ntaken part in the rebellion, they did not disqualify anybody from\r\nholding office or legislative mandate on account of such conduct; and\r\nthird, that while they forbade the payment of any debt or obligation\r\nincurred in aid of rebellion, they did not guarantee those incurred in\r\nthe suppression of such rebellion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The discussion of the propositions in Congress.]\r\n\r\nThe discussion in Congress upon these provisions lasted through the\r\nmonth of May and well into June. At last in the second week of June,\r\nthe two Houses arrived at an agreement upon the modifications which\r\nseemed proper and necessary, and the Article as thus perfected was\r\nadopted by the necessary two-thirds vote in each branch.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The final draft agreed upon.]\r\n\r\nThe first section had been modified by the incorporation into it of a\r\nsentence which defined citizenship of the United States. It reads: \"All\r\npersons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the\r\njurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the\r\nState wherein they reside.\" This cleared up all difficulties in\r\ndetermining who the persons were, whose privileges and immunities were\r\nto be protected against \"State\" action. It also settled the question,\r\nforever, as to whether citizenship of the United States or citizenship\r\nof the \"State\" is primary. There is no doubt that in that clause of the\r\noriginal {77} Constitution which declares that the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States, and the laws of Congress made in accordance therewith,\r\nand the treaties made under the authority thereof, are the supreme law\r\nof the land, no matter what may be found in \"State\" constitutions or\r\nlaws to the contrary, primary allegiance of all citizens and persons to\r\nthe United States was established and required, but the advocates of\r\n\"State\" sovereignty always contended that, because there was no express\r\nclause in the Constitution defining citizenship, and declaring the\r\ncitizenship of the United States primary, citizenship was primarily of\r\nthe \"State,\" and, hence, allegiance was due primarily to the \"State\" by\r\nall its inhabitants. It was very proper and very desirable that this\r\ncontention should be set at rest.\r\n\r\nThe language of the second section had been revised so as to make its\r\nmeaning more clear, but it had not been changed at all as to its\r\nmeaning. It reads in its perfected form: \"Representatives shall be\r\napportioned among the several States according to their respective\r\nnumbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding\r\nIndians not taxed. But when the right to vote at any election for the\r\nchoice of electors for President and Vice-President of the United\r\nStates, Representatives in Congress, the executive and judicial\r\nofficers of a State, or the members of the legislature thereof, is\r\ndenied to any of the male inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one\r\nyears of age, _and citizens of the United States_, or in any way\r\nabridged, except for participation in rebellion or other crime, the\r\nbasis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion\r\nwhich the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number\r\nof male citizens twenty-one years of age in such State.\"\r\n\r\nFor section third, denying suffrage until 1870 to all {78} persons who\r\nhad given aid voluntarily to the rebellion, Congress had substituted an\r\nentirely new resolution, which rendered the Confederate chieftains\r\nineligible to office instead of disqualifying the rank and file for\r\nsuffrage. It reads as follows: \"No person shall be a Senator or\r\nRepresentative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President,\r\nor hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or\r\nunder any State, who having previously taken an oath, as a member of\r\nCongress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any\r\nState legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State,\r\nto support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in\r\ninsurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to\r\nthe enemies thereof. But Congress may, by a vote of two-thirds of each\r\nHouse, remove such disability.\"\r\n\r\nThis was certainly a wise change. It certainly could not be contended\r\nthat disqualifications for holding office and legislative mandate\r\nviolated any so-called natural right. It was better that whatever\r\npunishments of a political nature might fall upon the Confederates\r\nshould strike the leaders, rather than the followers. And it was not a\r\nsevere punishment which required that, for a time at least, the people\r\ninhabiting the communities lately in rebellion should choose as their\r\nrepresentatives to the National legislature and to the Presidential\r\nelectoral college, and as their \"State\" officers, men not identified\r\nwith the rebellion so closely as to have been among its leaders. It is\r\ndifficult to see how the Confederate leaders could have been required\r\nto suffer less, and have been rebuked at all for their acts.\r\n\r\nFinally, section four was supplemented by a sentence which declared\r\nthat \"the validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized\r\nby law, including debts {79} incurred for payment of pensions and\r\nbounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall\r\nnot be questioned.\" The last words of the section were also somewhat\r\nmodified in the direction of greater emphasis, but the meaning remained\r\nthe same. As thus perfected, the section declared the validity of all\r\nthe existing obligations of the United States, and repudiated all\r\nobligations whatsoever assumed in aid of rebellion, and all claims for\r\nthe loss or emancipation of any slave. This covered the ground\r\ncompletely in regard to the security of the public obligations of the\r\nUnited States both from the positive and negative side, and it\r\nprevented both Congress and the \"States\" from ever recognizing, in the\r\nfuture, the claim for any relief from the natural consequences of\r\nunsuccessful rebellion, and the right to any compensation for\r\ndeprivation of property in man.\r\n\r\nAs Congress passed these propositions by the necessary two-thirds\r\nmajority they were not submitted to the President at all, it being\r\nconsidered that his disapproval, if given, would avail nothing against\r\nsuch a majority. This has been the custom from the first in\r\nCongressional propositions of amendment, and it is now too late to\r\ndispute its regularity. But it is easy to see that the President might\r\nsupport a veto of such propositions by such reasoning as to make it at\r\nleast possible that sufficient votes might be changed from affirmative\r\nto negative upon them, to finally defeat them; and it is certainly true\r\nthat the Constitution requires that every bill, order, resolution, or\r\nvote to which the concurrence of the Senate and House of\r\nRepresentatives may be necessary (except on a question of adjournment)\r\nshall be presented to the President and is subject to his approval or\r\nveto, no matter by what majority it may have been passed.\r\n\r\n{80} [Sidenote: The President's attitude toward the proposed\r\namendment.]\r\n\r\nHowever, President Johnson had no opportunity to express himself\r\nofficially or make himself officially felt in regard to this Amendment.\r\nIt was pretty well understood that he did not view it with favor while\r\nit was pending, and it soon became manifest that he was advising its\r\nrejection by the \"States.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Seward's acts in regard to ratification.]\r\n\r\nMr. Seward issued his notification of the passage of the amendment by\r\nCongress to the \"State\" legislatures for their ratificatory action on\r\nthe 16th of June. He sent the same to the legislatures of all the\r\n\"States,\" that is, to the legislatures of those bodies claiming to be\r\n\"States\" under the President's plan of Reconstruction, as well as to\r\nthe legislatures of those \"States\" which had never pretended to secede\r\nfrom the Union. This was, again, certainly a recognition of all these\r\nbodies as \"States\" of the Union by the executive branch of the\r\nGovernment, at least.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The requirement that the ratification of the proposed\r\nAmendment should be the condition of the admission of the Senators- and\r\nRepresentatives-elect to seats in Congress.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Reconstruction Committee of Congress had\r\nreported a bill along with the Article of Amendment, which virtually\r\nproposed to make the ratification of the proposed Amendment by the\r\nrespective legislatures of the reconstructed Southern communities the\r\ncondition of the admission of the Senators- and Representatives-elect\r\nfrom them to seats in Congress. That is, it was proposed that Congress\r\nshould make its recognition of the reconstructed bodies as \"States\"\r\nconditional upon their ratification of the Article of Amendment. Or\r\nperhaps some of those supporting this proposition would have preferred\r\nthe statement that it was proposed that Congress should make its\r\nrecognition of the reconstructed governments of the \"States\" in which\r\nsecession had {81} been attempted conditional upon the ratification of\r\nthe Amendment by the legislative departments of these reconstructed\r\ngovernments respectively.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The absurdity of the condition.]\r\n\r\nNo matter how it might have been stated, it was an absurdity. The true\r\ntheory on this point was that held by Mr. Stevens, viz., to consider\r\nonly those \"States\" which had never attempted secession, those \"States\"\r\nwhich had never been members of the Southern Confederacy, as\r\nconstituting the \"States\" of the Union at that moment, and all other\r\nterritory and people subject to the jurisdiction of the United States\r\nas being under the exclusive government of the central Government; to\r\namend the Constitution by a three-fourths majority of these loyal\r\n\"States\"; and then to admit these reconstructed communities as new\r\n\"States\" into the Union with its amended Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe amended Constitution would then have the same power over them as if\r\nthe Amendment had been ratified by them. In fact, their petition for\r\nadmission or recognition as \"States\" of the Union with the amended\r\nConstitution would imply their assent to the Amendment as well as to\r\nevery other part of the Constitution. The more moderate Republicans\r\nfeared that the Southern communities would not feel obligated by a\r\nConstitution amended in this way. It is difficult to see why they\r\nshould not. The Southern statesmen knew that Congress had no power\r\nunder the Constitution to require of new \"States\" obedience to anything\r\nas a condition of their admission to the Union, but the Constitution as\r\nit was at the moment of their admission. Looked at from the point of\r\nview of the present, it would certainly appear that the exaction of\r\nsuch an unlawful promise, imposing such a degrading discrimination,\r\nwould have been far more exasperating than anything else which could\r\nhave been invented or imagined.\r\n\r\n{82} Enough of them saw this to prevent Congress from enacting the bill\r\nproposed by the Reconstruction Committee into a law, and when the\r\nproposed Amendment went to the legislatures of the \"States,\" there was\r\nno requirement attending it which appeared to deprive any legislature,\r\nor body claiming to be a legislature, of its discretion in dealing with\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The precedent set by Tennessee.]\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, however, the legislature of Tennessee ratified the\r\nproposed Amendment within about a month after receiving the Article\r\nfrom Secretary Seward, and Congress thereupon passed the following\r\njoint resolution and sent it to the President for his signature:\r\n\"Whereas in the year 1861 the government of the State of Tennessee was\r\nseized upon and taken possession of by persons in hostility to the\r\nUnited States, and the inhabitants of said State, in pursuance of an\r\nact of Congress, were declared to be in a state of insurrection against\r\nthe United States; and whereas said State government can only be\r\nrestored to its former political relations in the Union by consent of\r\nthe lawmaking power of the United States; and whereas the people of\r\nsaid State did, on the 22d of February, 1865, by a large popular vote,\r\nadopt and ratify a constitution of government whereby slavery was\r\nabolished and all ordinances and laws of secession and debts contracted\r\nunder the same were declared void; and whereas a State government has\r\nbeen organized under said constitution which has ratified the amendment\r\nto the constitution abolishing slavery, also the amendment proposed by\r\nthe thirty-ninth Congress\" (the Fourteenth Amendment) \"and has done\r\nother acts proclaiming and denoting loyalty: Therefore, _Be it resolved\r\nby the Senate and House of Representatives in Congress assembled_, That\r\nthe State of Tennessee is hereby restored to her former practical\r\nrelations to the {83} Union, and is again entitled to be represented by\r\nSenators and Representatives in Congress.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Tennessee precedent.]\r\n\r\nThese proceedings made it certain that, while Congress had failed to\r\npass any formal act making the acceptance of the proposed Fourteenth\r\nAmendment a condition precedent to the readmission of the other\r\n\"States\" which had been in rebellion, Congress would not readmit any of\r\nthem which did not do this. Tennessee, it was thought, had sinned the\r\nleast of all, and, therefore, should be readmitted on lightest terms.\r\nMore might be righteously required of the others, but not less.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The President's message in regard to the rehabilitation of\r\nTennessee.]\r\n\r\nThe President signed the resolution, but accompanied the same with a\r\nshort message in which he made a rather telling criticism upon the\r\nprocedure of submitting proposed constitutional amendments to bodies\r\nnot already \"States\" in the Union, and warned Congress against\r\nconstruing his approval as committing him to all of the statements of\r\nfact contained in the preamble to the resolution, or to the doctrine\r\nthat Congress had any right \"to pass laws preliminary to the admission\r\nof duly qualified Representatives from any of the States.\" These latter\r\nwords manifest the fact that the President was still holding on to the\r\nidea that the whole function of Congress in Reconstruction consisted in\r\nthe power of each House to judge of the election and qualifications of\r\nits members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{84}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE CONGRESSIONAL PLAN (_Continued_)\r\n\r\nThe Reports of the Committee on Reconstruction--The Idea of a New\r\nElectorate as the Basis and Condition of Reconstruction--The Freedmen's\r\nBureau Act of July 16th, 1866--The Disaffection in the Cabinet--The New\r\nOrleans Riot--The Issue of Reconstruction in the Campaign of 1866--The\r\nCongressional Election of 1866--The President's Final Proclamation\r\nDeclaring the Civil War Ended--The October Elections--The President's\r\nMessage of December 3d, 1866--Rejection of the Proposed Fourteenth\r\nAmendment by the Legislatures of the Reconstructed \"States.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The reports of the Committee on Reconstruction.]\r\n\r\nTwo days after the transmission of the Fourteenth Amendment to the\r\n\"State\" legislatures, the Joint Committee of Congress on Reconstruction\r\nmade its final report, or rather reports, since there were two of them,\r\none being signed by all the Republican members of the Committee, and\r\nthe other by all the Democratic members.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The majority report.]\r\n\r\nThe majority report was an able defence of the view, that by rebellion\r\nand attempted secession the eleven \"States\" in which these things\r\nhappened had lost their \"Statehood\" and had become disorganized\r\ncommunities, but that while they could and had destroyed \"State\"\r\ngovernment, and placed themselves outside of the Union so far as\r\nexercising the powers and privileges of \"State\" local government was\r\nconcerned, they could not, and had not, escaped the obligations of the\r\nConstitution and the authority of the {85} central Government. The\r\nexact language of the report on this point was: \"The Constitution, it\r\nwill be observed, does not act upon States, as such, but upon the\r\npeople; while, therefore, the people cannot escape its authority, the\r\nStates may, through the act of their people, cease to exist in an\r\norganized form, and thus dissolve their political relations with the\r\nUnited States.\" The doctrine is here more clearly expressed than in\r\nother places, but even here there is a confusing modification contained\r\nin the words \"in an organized form.\" It would have been much clearer if\r\nthey had been entirely omitted. The framers of the report were\r\nevidently haunted by that spectre of an abstract, unorganized \"State,\"\r\nwhich has played such havoc with good sense in some of the subsequent\r\ndecisions of the Supreme Court, and which is nothing more than a\r\nPlatonic idea.\r\n\r\nBased upon this doctrine, the majority report naturally vindicated the\r\nexclusive right of Congress in the work of Reconstruction, which work\r\nwas virtually the admission of new \"States\" into the Union. It,\r\nfurthermore, demonstrated that the situation in these disorganized\r\nsections was one largely of exhausted disloyalty only, and that all\r\nthat the inhabitants of them had done under the President's\r\nReconstruction policy was directed toward putting the same men in power\r\nwho had led in the rebellion and toward denying civil, to say nothing\r\nof political, rights to the freedmen.\r\n\r\nAnd its final conclusion was, \"that Congress would not be justified in\r\nadmitting such communities to a participation in the government of the\r\ncountry without first providing such constitutional or other guarantees\r\nas would tend to secure the civil rights of all citizens of the\r\nRepublic; a just equality of representation; protection against claims\r\nfounded in rebellion and crime; a temporary restoration of the right of\r\nsuffrage to those {86} who have not actively participated in the\r\nefforts to destroy the Union and overthrow the Government; and the\r\nexclusion from positions of public trust of at least a portion of those\r\nwhose crimes have proved them to be the enemies of the Union, and\r\nunworthy of public confidence.\"\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, the proposed Fourteenth Article of Amendment had\r\nprovided for all of these things, except the direct conferring of\r\nsuffrage on anybody. With this exception, it had gone even further, in\r\nits provision declaratory of citizenship, and in its protection of the\r\npublic debt of the Union.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The minority report.]\r\n\r\nThe report of the minority, that is of the three Democrats, was written\r\nby Mr. Reverdy Johnson, of Maryland. It was, as a lawyer's brief, an\r\nable presentation of the view that a \"State\" of the Union can never\r\nbecome anything else than a \"State,\" no matter what may be the\r\ncharacter, deeds, attempts or disposition of the people who inhabit it,\r\nand is at all times entitled to the same powers, rights and privileges,\r\nunder the Constitution of the United States. It was, however, the\r\nveriest dry bones of legal reasoning, the veriest sophistry of juristic\r\nabstraction. There was no political science in it, no common sense in\r\nit, and it ended with an unfortunate and irritating defence of\r\nPresident Johnson's personal loyalty, which had not been in the\r\nslightest degree impugned by the majority.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The idea of a new electorate as the basis and condition of\r\nReconstruction.]\r\n\r\nThe majority report indicated, at least, that Congress might require\r\nsomething more than adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment by the\r\ncommunities lately in rebellion before they would be recognized as\r\nhaving been restored to their proper relations in the Union as\r\n\"States,\" and entitled to representation in Congress. At the moment,\r\nhowever, it is probable that a prompt adoption of {87} the proposed\r\nAmendment by any of the reconstructed legislatures would have been\r\nfollowed by a joint resolution on the part of Congress similar to that\r\nenacted in the case of Tennessee. There is no doubt that many of the\r\nmore radical members of Congress had been long considering the question\r\nof creating an entirely new electorate in the South as the only proper\r\nbasis for reconstruction, and that some of the conservatives, from\r\nbeing opponents of this idea at the beginning of the year, had, by the\r\nmiddle of it, begun, at least, to waver. To those who could read the\r\nsigns of the times correctly, it was manifest that a rejection of the\r\nproposed Fourteenth Amendment by these communities would lead Congress\r\nforward upon that line. The President ought to have understood this,\r\nwhen Mr. Raymond voted for the proposed Amendment in the House. He\r\nought to have done all in his power to influence the reconstructed\r\ncommunities to adopt the proposed Amendment, no matter whether the\r\nsubmission of it to them by the Secretary of State of the United States\r\nlogically involved their recognition as \"States\" of the Union by the\r\nAdministration at Washington, or not. They were not in a position to\r\nexact the precise conclusion of a logical process in their favor,\r\nespecially as it was based on a fallacious premise, and the President\r\ndid both himself and them a great wrong in not discouraging them from\r\nso doing.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Freedmen's Bureau Act of July 16th, 1866.]\r\n\r\nA few weeks later Congress scored another victory over the President,\r\none which did much toward wiping out the defeats of February 19th and\r\n21st. It passed another Freedmen's Bureau Bill, and then repassed it\r\nJuly 16th, over the President's veto. This bill was framed with the\r\npurpose in view of avoiding those features of the bill, successfully\r\nvetoed by the President on February 19th preceding, {88} which had\r\ninfluenced certain Republicans to sustain the President's veto. The\r\ndifferences between the two measures consisted in the following points.\r\nThe first bill had no definite time limit; the second would expire in\r\ntwo years from the date of its passage. The first bill vested\r\njurisdiction in the Freedmen's Bureau over the civil rights of freedmen\r\nand refugees in all parts of the United States. The second vested the\r\nbureau with jurisdiction over loyal refugees and freedmen without\r\nmention of place. The first vested a most sweeping power in the Bureau\r\nto give all kinds of aid and support to the destitute refugees and\r\nfreedmen. The second contained only the more moderate provision of the\r\noriginal law of March 3d, 1865, on that subject. Finally the first gave\r\nthe Bureau jurisdiction over the civil rights of freedmen and refugees,\r\nnot only when the deprivation of them was the consequence of rebellion,\r\nbut when it was effected by _any local law_, ordinance, police\r\nregulation or other regulation. The second, on the contrary, limited\r\nthe jurisdiction of the Bureau to those cases where the deprivation was\r\nthe consequence of rebellion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The veto of the measure.]\r\n\r\nThe President could not, however, see much difference between them. He\r\nclaimed that his objections to the first bill were valid against the\r\nsecond. The second measure, he contended, was only a war measure for a\r\ndefinite period, in a time of peace. It was the prolongation for a\r\ndefinite time of military jurisdiction over civil matters, when the\r\ncivil courts both \"State\" and Union were open and in the unhindered\r\ndischarge of their business. And he held the ground that Congress had\r\nno more constitutional power to create, or perpetuate, military\r\njurisdiction over civil matters for a definite period in time of peace\r\nthan for an indefinite period. He referred to the fact that the Civil\r\nRights measure, just passed over his veto, met all {89} the points\r\nprovided for in the Freedmen's Bureau bill, and affirmed that all of\r\nthe provisions of that law would be executed by him through ordinary\r\ncivil means, in so far as they should not be repealed by Congress or\r\ndeclared unconstitutional by the courts.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Correctness of the President's views.]\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of to-day it is difficult to see why the\r\nPresident was not right. There is no doubt that the Freedmen's Bureau\r\nwith its powers, jurisdiction and charities, was a far greater source\r\nof irritation in the South than was the presence of the United States\r\narmy. While its superior officers were generally men of ability and\r\ncharacter, a large number of the subalterns were canting hypocrites and\r\noutright thieves. They kept the negroes in a state of idleness, beggary\r\nand unrest, and made them a constant danger to the life and property of\r\nthe whites; and their veritable tyranny over the white population did\r\nmore to destroy Union sentiment among the whites and make them regard\r\nthe United States Government in a hostile light than anything which had\r\nhappened during the whole course of the rebellion. It was an\r\ninstitution which ought to have been dispensed with the instant that\r\nthe necessity which called it into existence passed away. The law of\r\nMarch 3d, 1865, had still about eight months to run, and Congress would\r\nbe in session again four months before it would expire. There was ample\r\nopportunity for prolonging the law, and that law, it was to be\r\npresumed, was less needed in 1866 than in 1865. It took all of the\r\nparty discipline of the Republicans to prevent sufficient disaffection\r\nin their ranks to sustain the President's veto. On the merits of the\r\nquestion alone they could not have done it. They were in error, and\r\nmany of them knew it, but they were now in to fight the President and\r\nthey must stand together.\r\n\r\n{90} [Sidenote: The veto overridden.]\r\n\r\nThe veto of the bill was dated July 16th, and the two Houses repassed\r\nit over the veto on the same day. The new law was to be executed\r\nthrough the War Department, as the original measure had been, and the\r\nSecretary of War had begun to manifest that indecent hostility to the\r\nPresident which disgraced the last years of the Administration. The\r\nPresident was largely cut off from even the knowledge of what was\r\ntaking place in the operations of the Freedmen's Bureau, and Mr.\r\nStanton now managed it in such a manner, whether intentional or not, as\r\nto cause the greatest possible friction between the Government and the\r\nwhites of the South, and thus to retard the process of Reconstruction\r\nand to destroy what had been already accomplished in that direction.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Disaffection in the Cabinet.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Stanton's attitude toward the President.]\r\n\r\nBesides Stanton, three other members of the Cabinet had showed their\r\ndisaffection toward the President's policy. They were Mr. Speed, the\r\nAttorney-General, Mr. Dennison, the Postmaster-General, and Mr. Harlan,\r\nthe Secretary of the Interior. During the course of the month (July)\r\nthese three gentlemen resigned their offices, and were replaced by Mr.\r\nStanbery, Mr. A. W. Randall, and Mr. O. H. Browning. Their sense of\r\npropriety would not permit them to retain high office under the\r\nPresident while differing with him so widely in regard to the\r\nfundamental question of Reconstruction. Mr. Stanton, however, took a\r\ndifferent view of his duty. He seemed to feel that he was under\r\nobligations to his country to remain in the President's Cabinet, at the\r\nhead of the most important branch of the Administration at that moment,\r\nand protect the country against the purposes of the President. He was\r\nsustained in this view by the Republican majority in Congress, which\r\nsoon entered upon its course of depriving {91} the President of his\r\nmilitary control even, by transferring his functions to the Secretary\r\nof War and the General of the army. To the men of the present day, Mr.\r\nStanton's conduct appears, at least, lacking in a proper sense of\r\ndelicacy. It may be regarded in an even more serious light. It may be\r\nlooked upon as a conspiracy with the Republican majority in Congress to\r\nrob the President of his constitutional prerogatives, to change the\r\nform of government from the presidential system to the parliamentary\r\nsystem of administration. It is difficult to find any sufficient\r\ndefence for Mr. Stanton's course. It is impossible to clear him of the\r\nappearance of great egotism or of great greed of office, in not\r\nresigning along with his dissatisfied colleagues.\r\n\r\nThe President knew of this difference of feeling between himself and\r\nhis War Secretary at the time of his reorganization of the Cabinet in\r\nJuly, and would undoubtedly have been glad to receive his resignation,\r\nbut he did not ask for it. The newspapers which sustained the\r\nAdministration did, however, and predicted that it would be\r\nforthcoming. The Republican leaders, on the other hand, encouraged\r\nStanton to hold on to the office, and represented to him that the\r\nwelfare of his country demanded the sacrifice of his personal feelings\r\nin the matter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The opinion and feeling in the North concerning the\r\ncondition of things in the South.]\r\n\r\nIt was now generally proclaimed throughout the North that the rebel\r\nchieftains had repossessed themselves of the reconstructed \"State\"\r\ngovernments and were making use of \"State\" powers to re-enslave the\r\nfreedmen. It was also proclaimed that the life and property of Union\r\nmen, of whatever race, at the South were utterly insecure, and that at\r\nleast a thousand men had been murdered in that section within a year's\r\ntime, without any considerable number of the {92} murderers having been\r\nbrought to justice. And it was asserted that the President of the\r\nUnited States had deserted the party of the Union, the party which had\r\nelevated him to the chief magistracy of the land, and was now\r\nconspiring with his old party friends, the Democrats, in both the North\r\nand the South, to drive the Republican party from power and restore the\r\nrégime of the Democracy of 1860.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The New Orleans riot.]\r\n\r\nAt this moment a horrible tragedy was enacted in New Orleans which\r\nseemed to give verification to some, if not all, of these statements.\r\nIt seems that the late Confederate leaders resident in Louisiana,\r\nhaving received pardon from the President of the United States upon\r\nfulfilling the conditions of the President's amnesty proclamation, had\r\ngot possession in 1864 of the reconstructed \"State\" government of\r\nLouisiana, with the exception of the governorship and some of the\r\njudicial offices. The constitution of 1864, made by sincere Union men,\r\ndid not exactly suit them, and the legislature in the spring of 1866\r\ntook into consideration a bill for calling another convention together\r\nfor the purpose of framing a new constitution, but the Administration\r\nat Washington frowned upon the movement and the legislature abandoned\r\nit. In like manner, the men who formed and established the constitution\r\nof 1864 were displeased with the fact that the \"State\" government under\r\nit had been captured at the polls by the old electorate of Louisiana,\r\nreinstated through the President's amnesty. They also wanted to change\r\nthe constitution, to so change it as to create an electorate which\r\nwould bring them back into power again. This meant negro suffrage. Just\r\nbefore the convention of 1864 adjourned, it passed a resolution vesting\r\nin the presiding officer of the convention the power, and imposing on\r\nhim the duty, of reconvoking the {93} convention in case the\r\nconstitution framed by it should not be ratified at the polls, or for\r\nany other necessary reason, for the purpose of taking such measures as\r\nmight be needful for forming civil government in Louisiana.\r\n\r\nOf course, when the constitution framed by the convention was adopted\r\nby popular vote and a \"State\" government was set up under it, common\r\nsense and common honesty would hold that the convention had been\r\nfinally dissolved, no matter how the wording of the resolution might be\r\nforced in the opposite direction. The men of \"'64\" saw in this wording\r\ntheir only chance, however, to rescue the \"State\" government from the\r\nhands of the amnestied electorate, and in their desperation they were\r\ndetermined to attempt to make use of it. A number of the members of the\r\nold convention got together informally on the 26th of June. The\r\npresident of the old convention did not call them together, and he\r\nwould not preside at the informal meeting. He made some trivial excuse;\r\nbut there cannot be much doubt in regard to his real reason. This\r\ninformal meeting then proceeded to elect a _pro tempore_ president,\r\nJudge Howell, an office-holder under the constitution of 1864. It was\r\nthis man who issued the proclamation of July 7th, reconvoking the old\r\nconvention of 1864. The time appointed by him was the 30th of July at\r\nnoon, and the place designated by him was the Mechanics' Institute\r\nBuilding at New Orleans. The men called together were the members of\r\nthe old convention, but to provide for any vacancies that might have\r\nhappened or might happen in the former membership of this old body,\r\nJudge Howell called on the Governor, Mr. Wells, to issue writs of\r\nelection. The governor did so, and ordered an election of such\r\ndelegates to be held September 3d. He thus manifested his approval of\r\nthe movement.\r\n\r\n{94} Naturally the party of the amnestied viewed this scheme for\r\ndepriving them of the \"State\" government by means of a new\r\nconstitution, framed by a defunct convention, and certain to contain a\r\nprovision for negro suffrage, with the most intense hostility. They\r\nwere not placated either by being referred to the consideration that\r\nthe constitution framed by this convention must be submitted to the\r\nsuffrages of the existing electorate, and must be ratified by a\r\nmajority of the same, before it could be put into operation. They had a\r\nsuspicion that the whole thing was instigated by the wicked Republicans\r\nat the North, and that the voting upon such a proposed constitution\r\nwould be controlled by them through the military of the United States\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nThey, therefore, resolved to nip the plan in the bud by preventing the\r\nassembly of the convention, or forcing it to disperse if it did\r\nassemble. The mayor of the city, Mr. Monroe, the same who was mayor\r\nwhen the Union army entered the city in 1862, applied to the General in\r\ncommand of the United States troops in Louisiana, General Absalom\r\nBaird, to know what attitude the military authorities would take toward\r\nthe convention, and informed General Baird that he intended to disperse\r\nthe convention if it should attempt to assemble without having the\r\napproval of these authorities. General Baird was acting for General\r\nSheridan, who was absent from his post, and he replied with much more\r\ncaution than he would probably have done had he been alone responsible.\r\nHe told Mayor Monroe that he thought the Governor of the \"State,\"\r\nrather than the mayor of the city, was the man to interfere with the\r\nassembly of a body professing to be a \"State\" convention, if there was\r\nto be any interference at all, and he gave the mayor to understand that\r\nhis proposed course might be perilous. This was the {95} 25th of July.\r\nTwo days later the mayor went again to the General, this time\r\naccompanied by the Lieutenant-Governor, who was of the party of the\r\namnestied. He now told General Baird that the police would not\r\nundertake to prevent the assembly of the convention, or disperse its\r\nmembers when assembled, but that its members would be indicted by the\r\ngrand jury and arrested by the sheriff. The General seemed to think\r\nthat the convention could lawfully assemble, but agreed with the mayor\r\nand Lieutenant-Governor that both he and they would request\r\ninstructions from Washington.\r\n\r\nThe General applied to the Secretary of War, and the mayor applied to\r\nthe President. The General informed the Secretary of the movement to\r\nassemble a convention; that it had the approval of the Governor; that\r\nthe Lieutenant-Governor and the municipal authorities considered it\r\nunlawful and proposed to prevent it by arresting the delegates; that he\r\nhad declared to them that he would not permit them to do this, unless\r\nthe President should so instruct him; and he asked for orders, in the\r\npremises, by telegraph. The Lieutenant-Governor and the\r\nAttorney-General of the \"State\" informed the President of the movement\r\nto assemble the old convention; informed him that negroes were\r\nassembling, incendiary speeches were being made calling them to arm\r\nthemselves, and the President was being denounced; that the Governor\r\nwas in sympathy with the movement; that the matter was before the grand\r\njury; and that it was contemplated to have the members of the\r\nconvention arrested by criminal process; and they asked the President\r\nto inform them whether the military authorities would interfere to\r\nprevent the execution of the processes of the criminal court.\r\n\r\nSecretary Stanton did not reply to General Baird's application at all.\r\nHe did not even communicate the {96} General's application to the\r\nPresident. He afterward explained that he did not consider that Baird's\r\ntelegram required any reply. Baird had said in his despatch that he had\r\ninformed the Lieutenant-Governor and the city authorities that he would\r\nnot allow them to arrest the delegates and break up the convention\r\nunless instructed to do so by the President. The Secretary did not\r\npropose to send the General any such orders, or to allow any such to be\r\ntransmitted to him from the President through the War Department, and\r\nso the Secretary thought it best to let the matter rest where the\r\nGeneral had placed it. He did not know that the President had been\r\napplied to by the other side, and the President did not inform the\r\nSecretary of the despatch which he had received. The confidence between\r\nthe two men had been already so largely destroyed as to prevent even\r\nconsultation upon these grave subjects.\r\n\r\nThe President, on the other hand, answered the application made to him.\r\nHe telegraphed to the Lieutenant-Governor that the military would be\r\nexpected to sustain, and not to obstruct, or interfere with, the\r\nproceedings of the criminal court. He did not send any orders to\r\nGeneral Baird, however. Whether the Lieutenant-Governor showed his\r\ntelegram from the President to General Baird or not is not positively\r\nknown, so far as the writer of these pages has been able to discover,\r\nbut it is probable that he did.\r\n\r\nIt was certainly then the understanding on all sides, at least, that\r\nthe \"State\" and municipal authorities would deal with the delegates to\r\nthe convention, if they interfered with them at all, through the grand\r\njury and the officers of the criminal court, and not through the\r\npolice. This did not mean, of course, that the police should not be\r\npresent in the neighborhood of the convention for the purpose of\r\nkeeping the {97} public peace. They were ordered to assemble at the\r\nstations on the morning of the 30th (July) and to bring their arms.\r\nAccording to General Sheridan's report to the President, the riot was\r\noccasioned by the marching of a procession of negroes, about one\r\nhundred strong and partly armed, through several of the streets to the\r\nlocality of the convention. It occurred about an hour after the members\r\nof the convention had assembled. Naturally a number of people, mostly\r\nof the lower orders, gathered on the sidewalks of the streets through\r\nwhich the procession passed. Hooting and jeering followed. Then a shot\r\nwas fired, probably by a negro in the procession. Then other shots\r\nfollowed and the crowd rushed after the procession, which soon arrived\r\nin front of the building in which the convention sat. Brickbats now\r\nflew from each side and the riot was in full progress when the police\r\nappeared on the scene. The procession rushed into the building, leaving\r\na few of its members outside. One of these and a policeman came to\r\nblows, when another shot was fired, upon which the policemen began\r\nfiring through the windows of the building. After a few moments a white\r\nflag was displayed from one of the windows, whereupon the firing ceased\r\nand the policemen rushed into the building. Once in the building they\r\nfired their revolvers upon the persons present indiscriminately and\r\nwith terrible effect. The persons who succeeded in escaping from the\r\nbuilding were also fired on by the police and by citizens, and many\r\nwere killed or wounded. Nearly two hundred persons were killed or\r\ninjured, mostly negroes, but some whites, and among them some members\r\nof the proposed convention. There were no United States troops in the\r\ncity at the hour of the riot, their barracks being outside. General\r\nBaird had ordered four companies to take position near the place of the\r\n{98} convention, but owing to the fact that he had got the impression\r\nthat the convention would assemble at 6 P.M., he had ordered them to\r\nrepair to the assigned position at 5 P.M. They, consequently, did not\r\narrive until the riot was over and the convention was dispersed.\r\n\r\nEach party considered the other the aggressor. The Republicans of the\r\nNorth viewed the massacre as a new rebellion, while the amnestied\r\nSoutherners considered the riot the result of a justified resistance to\r\nan attempt to force negro suffrage and then negro rule upon them. It is\r\nvery nearly certain that the first shot was fired by a negro, but this\r\nwould not justify the wholesale massacre executed by the police. It\r\ncould, therefore, be held by the Republicans with a great show of truth\r\nthat the public authorities of the reconstructed \"State\" government of\r\nLouisiana not only would not extend the equal protection of the laws to\r\nall persons, but would themselves deprive persons even of life without\r\ndue process of law.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The issue of Reconstruction in the campaign of 1866.]\r\n\r\nThe issue of the campaign of 1866 was thus made up. It was simply\r\nwhether Congress should reconstruct the President's reconstructed\r\n\"States,\" or rather should pronounce the President's Reconstruction,\r\nand the Reconstruction effected by the amnestied Southerners, null and\r\nvoid, and proceed to do the work _de novo_, with the purpose of\r\ncreating adequate guarantee for life and property and for the equal\r\nprotection of the laws to all.\r\n\r\nAlthough it was not a Presidential year, the election of the members of\r\nthe House of Representatives with such a problem to deal with, and the\r\nelection of \"State\" legislatures which would consider the question of\r\nadopting the proposed Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, made\r\nthe canvass of 1866 a truly national {99} one. Four National\r\nConventions were held during the summer and early autumn, two of each\r\nparty.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The National Conventions of the summer of 1866.]\r\n\r\nThe Administration party led off with their great meeting in\r\nPhiladelphia on the 14th of August. There were a few prominent\r\nRepublicans among the delegates, such as Montgomery Blair, Raymond,\r\nDix, Cowan, Doolittle and Browning, but the vast majority of them were\r\nDemocrats. All of the Southern delegates were such. The larger number\r\nof the Northern Democrats were conservative men of the stamp and style\r\nof R. C. Winthrop, W. B. Lawrence, S. J. Tilden, J. P. Stockton, J. E.\r\nEnglish and Reverdy Johnson, but there were also present men of more\r\nradical anti-national creed, like Fernando Wood, J. G. Sinclair, and\r\nJames Campbell. Even Clement L. Vallandigham, presented himself as a\r\ndelegate. There were many, however, who objected to his presence and he\r\nwithdrew. The doctrines put forward at this meeting were simply those\r\nof the President's Reconstruction policy, the doctrines that the\r\n\"States\" in our Federal system are indestructible and immaculate, and\r\nunder submission to national authority always possessed of the rights\r\nof local self-government and of representation in the National\r\nGovernment. These doctrines were developed into such extreme forms of\r\nstatement, and such extreme results were boldly accepted as their\r\nlogical consequences, that the cause of the Administration was damaged\r\nrather than helped at the North by the work and experiences of the\r\nconvention.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as there had been a great display of harmony between the\r\nleading men of the South and the Northern delegates in the convention\r\nof the 14th of August, making it appear that the Democrats were the\r\nparty of peace and reunion, while the Republicans were {100} in favor\r\nof a continuation of the hostile status, the Southern Republicans, or\r\nas they called themselves the loyal Union men of the South, assembled\r\nin considerable numbers in Philadelphia on the 3d of September, for the\r\npurpose of conferring with the leading Republicans of the North in\r\nregard to the condition of things in the South. Such men as John Minor\r\nBotts, William G. Brownlow, George W. Paschal, Thomas J. Durant, M. J.\r\nSafford, Thomas H. Benton, Lewis M. Kenzie, G. W. Ashburn, and many\r\nmore of almost equal reputation came to counsel with the leaders of the\r\nRepublican party. Many of the most important of these were there,\r\nTrumbull, Greeley, Morton, Chandler, Schenck, Schurz, Matthews, Curtin,\r\nCameron, Gerry, Speed, the ex-Attorney-General, and Creswell. These are\r\nonly a few names of the eminent men who were present.\r\n\r\nThe delegates separated into two bodies, one body comprehending the\r\nrepresentatives from the South, and the other those from the North.\r\nThis was done in order to leave the Southerners free from undue\r\nNorthern influence. Mr. Speed presided over the Southern assembly, and\r\nin his opening words declared the purpose of the convention to be to\r\ndetermine and proclaim whether the assertion of the late Confederates\r\nthat their constitutional rights were being denied them in not\r\nadmitting their Representatives- and Senators-elect to seats in\r\nCongress was true, or whether, on the other hand, the claim of the\r\nemancipated that their civil and natural rights were being denied them\r\nwas true. He soon left no doubt upon the minds of his hearers as to his\r\nown view and belief, and he denounced the President's reconstruction\r\nwork, both in principle and results, most roundly. On account of the\r\nintimate relation in which he had stood to the President as his legal\r\nadviser, and on {101} account of the fact that he was a citizen of one\r\nof the old slave-holding \"States,\" his words had tremendous effect in\r\nsteeling the purpose of the Republicans of the North.\r\n\r\nUnder the inspiration of Mr. Speed's speech, the Southern convention\r\nframed and fulminated an address which arraigned the President as\r\nalmost a traitor to his party and the Union, and as a friend of rebels\r\nand of sympathizers with rebels, described the results of his\r\nReconstruction policy and acts as most deplorable, and urged the speedy\r\nadoption of the proposed Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution as\r\nthe only possible cure for the evils which were afflicting the country.\r\nThis address made up the issues of the campaign. The dividing line of\r\nthe parties now separated those who favored the adoption of the\r\nproposed Fourteenth Amendment from those who did not. The issue was\r\nsimple, and the vote upon it was decisive, as we shall see.\r\n\r\nThe Administration party now attempted to divide the late soldiers, as\r\nit had attempted to divide the Republicans, with but little better\r\neffect. They got together a convention of the veterans at Cleveland,\r\nOhio, on the 17th of September, and had the venerable General Wool\r\npreside over it. There were many good men and true present, among them\r\nGordon Granger, Rousseau, Custer, McClernand, and Thomas Ewing; and\r\nthey accused the Republicans of attempting to stir up another civil war\r\nover the question of negro suffrage, and urged their old comrades to\r\ninsist that the status of peace, and all the consequences thereof,\r\nexisted and must be preserved.\r\n\r\nThis movement was met on the other side by the assembly of a Republican\r\nsoldier convention at Pittsburg on the 25th and 26th of September, for\r\nthe purpose of upholding Congress in its fight with the Administration\r\nover the question of Reconstruction. The convention {102} was presided\r\nover by General J. D. Cox, and a host of the most capable officers of\r\nthe armies of the Union, lately disbanded, participated in its\r\ndeliberations and resolves. They denounced the President's\r\nReconstruction policy, pronounced their adherence to Congress, and\r\ndeclared for the adoption of the proposed Fourteenth Amendment as the\r\nindispensable measure for the re-establishment of peace, justice and\r\nunion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The canvass of 1866.]\r\n\r\nDuring the summer and autumn the orators and politicians of both\r\nparties pursued the canvass upon the basis of the doctrines put forth\r\nby the conventions. A very large number, an unusually large number, of\r\nthe leading men of the country, took part in the great debate. Even the\r\nPresident of the United States took part in it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"swing around the circle.\"]\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of August he started from Washington to go to Chicago to be\r\npresent at the laying of the corner-stone of the Douglas monument. He\r\ntook with him General Grant, Admiral Farragut, three of his Cabinet\r\nofficers, Seward, Randall and Welles, and a large number of lesser\r\nlights. Crowds gathered at all the principal stopping-places, and the\r\nPresident spoke to them in defence of his policy of Reconstruction and\r\nof his acts in the execution of it. He denounced his enemies and\r\nopponents bitterly, and descended to undignified and even vulgar\r\naltercation with individuals in the crowds. In his speech at St. Louis,\r\non September 28th, his hot temper betrayed him into an attempt to throw\r\nupon Congress, the radical Congress, as he called it, the blame for the\r\nNew Orleans riot, and he went to the imprudent extreme of almost making\r\nan excuse or a quasi-excuse for the riot. The whole performance of the\r\nPresident upon the journey was termed \"swinging around the circle,\" and\r\nit both degraded the great office and its {103} incumbent, and injured\r\nthe prospects of the Administration party in the campaign.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The President's final proclamation declaring the Civil War\r\nended.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The October elections.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Republican triumph in the elections of 1866.]\r\n\r\nThe President had on the 20th day of August, a week before setting out\r\nupon his tour, finally proclaimed the insurrection and Civil War at an\r\nend in every part of the country. He had, on the 2d day of April\r\npreceding, declared the insurrection at an end everywhere except in\r\nTexas, and the proclamation of August 20th gave official witness to its\r\ncessation in Texas. It is certainly a prerogative of the President to\r\nproclaim the cessation of opposition to his execution of the laws of\r\nthe Union, and then to execute the same thereafter through civil,\r\ninstead of military, officers. If the President had meant no more than\r\nthis by his proclamations of the termination of the insurrection, the\r\nposition would have been unassailable. But he evidently intended his\r\nproclamations as furnishing a basis for his Reconstruction work, or at\r\nany rate as furnishing a great reason for the general recognition of\r\nthe validity of that work. This we can easily gather from the speeches\r\nhe made as he \"swung around the circle\" in the campaign of 1866. He\r\nfelt that he had solid ground under his feet, and did not appreciate\r\nthe fact that he was resting one of his doctrines upon another, the\r\nlatter being no more self-evident than the former. He felt quite sure\r\nof victory, until what were called the \"October States,\" at that time,\r\nPennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana and Iowa, held their elections. The two\r\n\"September States,\" Vermont and Maine, had largely increased their\r\nRepublican majorities, which the President had probably expected and\r\nallowed for, but when the four \"October States\" gave only twelve seats\r\nin the House of Representatives to the Democrats and nearly fifty to\r\nthe Republicans, it was pretty clearly revealed {104} that the\r\nAdministration was on the eve of a terrible defeat. It was as\r\noverwhelming as these figures indicated. The final results showed that\r\nthe Republicans had elected one hundred and forty-three of their\r\ncandidates to seats in the House of Representatives, while the\r\nDemocrats had succeeded in securing only forty-nine seats. With the\r\nexception of Delaware, Maryland and Kentucky, all the \"States\"\r\nrepresented in Congress had given the Republican party strong\r\nmajorities. The strength of the Democratic party was again in the\r\nSouth, where the Democratic candidates for any kind of office had\r\nalmost universally succeeded. In the Senate the Republicans constituted\r\nmore than a two-thirds majority of the members, and with their almost\r\nthree-fourths majority in the House, there could be no question that,\r\nin a contest between the President and Congress, the former would be\r\nobliged to yield.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The President's Message of December 3d, 1866.]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all this, however, the President, in his Message to\r\nCongress of December 3d, returned to the contest. He reargued his case\r\nfrom every point of view, and with both moderation and great force. He\r\nrestated what had been done toward Reconstruction, declaring that peace\r\nhad been restored everywhere, that all the laws of the United States\r\nand all the machinery of the United States Government were in unimpeded\r\noperation everywhere throughout the length and breadth of the land, and\r\nthat loyal \"State\" governments had been restored everywhere, and lacked\r\nbut one thing of completion, viz., the admission of Representatives and\r\nSenators from ten of the eleven \"States\" in which secession ordinances\r\nhad been passed to seats in Congress. He contended that all the\r\ndepartments of the United States Government had proceeded upon the view\r\nthat the \"States\" were indestructible--the Congress, in the {105}\r\ndeclaration, at the outset, that the war was not to be waged in any\r\nspirit of oppression, nor for any purpose of conquest or subjugation,\r\nnor purpose of overthrowing or interfering with the rights or\r\nestablished institutions of the \"States\" which were the scene of\r\nrebellion, but to defend and maintain the supremacy of the Constitution\r\nand all laws made in pursuance thereof, and to preserve the Union, with\r\nall the dignity, equality, and rights of the several States unimpaired,\r\nand in many other acts and resolutions; the Judiciary, in all\r\nproceedings affecting the reconstruction communities as \"States\"; and\r\nthe Executive, in the entire plan of Reconstruction created by Mr.\r\nLincoln and followed out by himself. He further contended that in\r\nrecognizing these \"States\" as restored to their former relations,\r\nCongress was not running any risk of having disloyal men thrust into\r\nthe legislative chambers of the nation, because each House of Congress\r\ncould reject members-elect on account of disloyalty, and could continue\r\nto reject until the constituencies should send up such persons as the\r\nHouse could approve, and could expel any member whose conduct should\r\nreveal disloyalty. He therefore urged Congress to acknowledge the\r\nReconstruction of the \"States\" lately in rebellion, in principle, and\r\nto apply the powers of the two Houses in regard to the elections,\r\nreturns and qualifications of their respective members to the\r\nindividual persons elected to seats.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ineffectiveness of the President's argument.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rejection of the proposed Fourteenth Amendment by the\r\nlegislatures of the Reconstructed \"States.\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The effect of this on the temper of the North.]\r\n\r\nThe President's argument fell, however, upon deaf ears. This was, it is\r\ntrue, the second session of the Thirty-ninth Congress, and was not,\r\ntherefore, composed of the persons just elected; but the influence of\r\nthe recent elections over its members had been to cow the\r\nconservatives, strengthen the radicals, and cause the wavering to\r\nincline to the side of the extremists. They took the {106} verdict of\r\nthe people to be that Congress should ignore the President's work in\r\nReconstruction, develop a plan of its own, put it into operation, and\r\nbase it upon a newly constructed electorate in the South, in which the\r\nlately emancipated should participate. The attitude of the legislatures\r\nof the President's reconstructed \"States\" in regard to the proposed\r\nFourteenth Amendment also strengthened them greatly in this view and\r\npurpose. Before the first day of January, 1867, all of these except\r\nthree had rejected it by overwhelming votes, and these three followed\r\nthe same course a little later. It was said and believed in Washington\r\nthat they had rejected the proposed Amendment contemptuously, and under\r\nthe advice of the President of the United States. It was the angry\r\nrejection of the proposed Amendment which did more than anything and\r\neverything else to convince the people of the North that Reconstruction\r\nmust be now undertaken by Congress, and must proceed upon the basis of\r\na new electorate at the South which Congress should create.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{107}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE CONGRESSIONAL PLAN (_Completed_)\r\n\r\nNegro Suffrage in the District of Columbia--The First Attempts at\r\nImpeachment--Stories of Outrages at the South--The Reconstruction\r\nBill--Passage of the Bill by the House--The Bill as Finally Agreed\r\nupon--The Condition that the Fourteenth Amendment must be Ratified by a\r\nSufficient Number of \"States\" to make it a Part of the\r\nConstitution--The Tenure-of-Office Bill--The Supplementary\r\nReconstruction Bill--The Assignment of the Commanding Generals to the\r\nMilitary Districts Created by the Reconstruction Acts--The\r\nRe-establishment of Martial Law in the South--The President's\r\nInstructions to the Generals in Interpretation of the Reconstruction\r\nActs--The Congressional Interpretation of the Reconstruction Acts--The\r\nPresident's Veto of the Bill Interpreting the Reconstruction Acts--The\r\nVeto Overridden--The Suspension of Stanton from Office.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Negro suffrage in the District of Columbia.]\r\n\r\nThe Congress had but just put itself in working order, when a bill was\r\nintroduced and passed extending the suffrage to negroes in the District\r\nof Columbia. The Republicans reasoned that they could not with good\r\ngrace force negro suffrage on the South before establishing it in the\r\nDistrict, and that the District was the best place in the country to\r\ntry the experiment first. The bill went to the President on the 26th of\r\nDecember, six days after the adjournment of Congress for the Christmas\r\nvacation, although it had passed the Houses on the 13th and 14th. The\r\nPresident held it until January 5th, 1867, and then returned it to the\r\nSenate with his veto.\r\n\r\n{108} [Sidenote: The President's veto of the bill establishing negro\r\nsuffrage in the District of Columbia.]\r\n\r\nThe Message was a strong paper, and to an impartial mind at this day it\r\nis a convincing paper. There is no question that Congress had the\r\nconstitutional power to establish negro suffrage in the District. The\r\nPresident did not dispute that. He simply argued that in legislating\r\nfor the District, Congress stood in a relation to the inhabitants of\r\nthe District analogous to that which the legislature of a \"State\" bore\r\nto the inhabitants of the \"State,\" and that as the legislature of a\r\n\"State\" would not act in opposition to the expressed will of a large\r\nmajority of the voters in the \"State,\" so Congress in legislating for\r\nthe District of Columbia ought not to disregard the expressed will of a\r\nlarge majority of the voters in the District. He then referred to the\r\nvote of the District upon this very subject, taken in December of 1865,\r\nonly one year before, when out of a poll of 6,556, one of the largest\r\nvotes ever cast in the Capital city, only thirty-five ballots were cast\r\nfor negro suffrage, and in Georgetown out of a poll of 813 only one\r\nballot was cast for negro suffrage. He further argued that Congress\r\nought not to make the District a place for trying political experiments\r\nof so grave a character as conferring suffrage, the highest privilege\r\nof American citizenship, upon a race of men just emerging from the\r\nignorance and vice attendant on a condition of slavery. And he finally\r\nasked the Congress to reconsider an act which appeared to him to be the\r\ndegradation and possibly the destruction of American suffrage.\r\n\r\nThere is no gainsaying that this was good reasoning, but Congress was\r\nin no frame of mind to give ear to the counsel of the President. It\r\ntook the ground that in legislating for the District it was acting for\r\nthe whole United States and not simply for the inhabitants of the\r\nDistrict, and that there was no place in the entire {109} country where\r\npolitical experiments could be more safely tried than in the District,\r\nsince Congress had plenary legislative power in the District and could\r\ndiscover and correct mistakes and defects in its legislation more\r\neasily and promptly there than anywhere else.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The first attempts at impeachment.]\r\n\r\nBoth Houses repassed the bill over the President's veto by the\r\nnecessary two-thirds majority, the Senate on the 7th of January and the\r\nHouse on the 8th, and negro suffrage was established in the District of\r\nColumbia. The President's veto so angered some of the extremists that\r\nresolutions of impeachment were introduced into the House, and a\r\nresolution for the appointment of a committee to inquire whether there\r\nwere reasons for impeachment was actually carried, and a committee was\r\nappointed. The committee sought everywhere and in every way for grounds\r\nupon which to arraign the President at the bar of the Senate, but for\r\nthe moment it failed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Stories of outrages at the South.]\r\n\r\nAt the same time the halls of Congress were ringing with the most\r\nextravagant tales of outrages against the negroes and loyal men of the\r\nSouth at the hands of the late rebels, and of the collusion of the\r\nnewly established \"State\" governments with the same. In addition to\r\nthis, the other three of the ten newly constructed \"State\" legislatures\r\nrejected the proposed Fourteenth Amendment, two of them by unanimous\r\nvote, and the other by every vote but one.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Fourteenth Amendment as the condition of recognizing the\r\nrevival of statehood.]\r\n\r\nWhile, as we have seen, the Congress did not pass the proposition to\r\nmake the acceptance of the proposed Fourteenth Amendment by the newly\r\nreconstructed \"States\" the condition of recognizing them as \"States\" of\r\nthe Union, and admitting the Senators- and Representatives-elect from\r\nthem to seats in Congress, yet the popular mind had so conceived the\r\nmatter, and the {110} order of events in the case of Tennessee had\r\ngiven this conception the force of precedent. The Republicans in\r\nCongress and the North could now fairly claim that they had offered to\r\nrecognize the President's reconstructed \"States,\" although these bodies\r\nwere without constitutional warrant, upon the most moderate terms which\r\nconsideration for the necessary consequences of the Civil War and the\r\nvictory of the Union would allow, and that their offer had been\r\nrejected in every case, except, of course, that of Tennessee--rejected\r\nby such majorities and in such a manner as to make the rejection amount\r\nto defiance. It was true that logically and constitutionally Congress\r\nhad no power to make the acceptance of something not at the time a part\r\nof the Constitution a condition for the admission of the new \"States,\"\r\nor the readmission of old \"States,\" into the Union; and Congress had\r\nnot done this formally. It is also true, both in good logic and in\r\nsound constitutional law, that the proposed Fourteenth Amendment should\r\nnot have been submitted at all to bodies that were not conventions of\r\nthe people in, or legislatures of, \"States\" in the Union. Logically and\r\nconstitutionally the whole thing was irregular. But it was as it was,\r\nand all understood that the way to cut the knot was for the\r\nlegislatures of the reconstructed \"States\" to adopt the proposed\r\nFourteenth Amendment, as Tennessee had done. When they refused to do\r\nso, it was natural and it was necessary that Congress should at last\r\noverturn all of the President's proceedings in Reconstruction, and all\r\nof the proceedings made under his guidance, and begin _de novo_, and\r\nupon the true constitutional principle of the exclusive power of\r\nCongress to admit new \"States\" into the Union, or, more scientifically\r\nexpressed, to create new States or control their creation on territory\r\n{111} of the Union in which loyal civil government did not exist.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The correctness of the Republican view.]\r\n\r\nThere can be no question in the mind of any sound political scientist\r\nand constitutional lawyer that Congress was in the right, logically,\r\nmorally, and legally, in insisting upon brushing aside the results of\r\nexecutive Reconstruction in the winter of 1867, and beginning the work\r\nitself from the bottom up. It ought to have done so in 1865. It ought\r\nto have created, so soon as armed resistance to the execution of the\r\nlaws of the United States ceased, regular Territorial civil governments\r\nthroughout the country which had been in insurrection, and then have\r\nadmitted these Territories as \"States\" whenever the conditions\r\nwarranting the same should have been attained. The phantom of the\r\n\"indestructible State\" had too strong an influence over the minds of\r\nall at that moment to admit of such a solution of the question. But\r\nafter the experiences of 1865 and 1866, and the discussions in the last\r\nsession of the Thirty-ninth Congress, the minds of the Republicans at\r\nleast, both in and out of Congress, were prepared to break away from\r\nthe influence of this idea and to view the process of Reconstruction as\r\nnothing but the admission of new \"States\" into the Union, new \"States\"\r\nfounded on territory and including inhabitants that had indeed once\r\nformed \"States,\" but had renounced Statehood in the Union through\r\ndisloyalty to the Union, and had been brought back to the position of\r\nterritories, civilly unorganized in local instance, but subject to the\r\nexclusive jurisdiction of the central Government. From such a point of\r\nview, the method of procedure was plain. While it is strange that the\r\nCongress did not follow this course in 1865, it is simply astounding\r\nthat it made such a mess of it in 1867.\r\n\r\n{112} [Sidenote: The Reconstruction bill.]\r\n\r\nThe Reconstruction bill was presented from the Committee of fifteen on\r\nReconstruction to the House of Representatives on the 6th of February\r\nby Mr. Stevens. It was a thoroughly drastic measure. Instead of\r\ncreating Territorial civil government in the usual manner, with an\r\nelectorate designated by Congress, and with powers under the control of\r\nCongress, and sustained, if necessary, by the military of the United\r\nStates, which would have been amply sufficient to meet all the real or\r\nproper exigencies of the case, the bill began by declaring that the\r\npretended \"State\" governments of the so-called Confederate States did\r\nnot protect adequately life or property, but countenanced and\r\nencouraged lawlessness and crime; and that it was necessary that peace\r\nand good order should be enforced in the so-called Confederate States\r\nuntil loyal \"State\" governments could be legally established therein;\r\nand then went on to enact that the said so-called Confederate States\r\nshould be divided into five military divisions and made subject to the\r\nmilitary authority of the United States, Virginia to constitute the\r\nfirst division, North Carolina and South Carolina the second, Georgia,\r\nAlabama, and Florida the third, Mississippi and Arkansas the fourth,\r\nand Louisiana and Texas the fifth; that the General of the army should\r\nassign an army officer of not less rank than a brigadier-general to the\r\ncommand of each of these divisions, and detail sufficient military\r\nforces, and place them under the command of each of said generals, to\r\nenable him to enforce his authority in the district over which he\r\nshould be placed; that these commanders might use civil tribunals in\r\nthe enforcement of the laws if they should see fit, but that, if these\r\nwere not effective they might institute and govern through military\r\ncommissions; that no sentence of these commissions should be executed\r\nuntil approved {113} by the commanding officer of the district; and\r\nfinally, that the United States courts and judges should issue no writs\r\nof Habeas Corpus against the proceedings and judgments of these\r\ncommissions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The bill indefensible from the constitutional point of\r\nview.]\r\n\r\nThere was hardly a line in the entire bill which would stand the test\r\nof the Constitution. In the first place, the Congress of the United\r\nStates, or any other part of the Government of the United States, can\r\nestablish martial law in any part of the territory of the United States\r\nonly when and where there is armed resistance to the execution of the\r\nlaws of the United States, or of some \"State\" or Territory whose\r\njurisdiction is being defended by the Government of the United States.\r\nSuch was not the condition anywhere in the South. The Executive had\r\nproclaimed that such resistance had ceased everywhere several months\r\nbefore; that he had appointed civil officers throughout the South for\r\nthe execution of the laws of the United States, in many cases with the\r\nadvice and consent of the Senate; that these laws were in operation\r\neverywhere; and that the United States courts were open everywhere and\r\nin the unhindered discharge of their functions and duties. It was not\r\npretended, of course, that there was armed resistance to the execution\r\nof the laws of the reconstructed \"States,\" and that the military of the\r\nUnited States was to act simply in support of \"State\" authority. There\r\nwere here and there, it is true, some of the remains of the military\r\nauthority of the United States, exercised during the period of the\r\ninsurrection, but they were a very poor basis upon which to found a\r\nresumption of the reign of martial law throughout the length and\r\nbreadth of the South. No sane and just mind can consider for a moment\r\nsuch a ground as sufficient in policy, morals or constitutional law.\r\nWhile the people of these districts {114} which had attempted to secede\r\nfrom the Union had forfeited their rights to the \"State\" form of local\r\ngovernment, they still had, after they had ceased from armed resistance\r\nto the Government of the United States, the rights guaranteed to the\r\ncriminal by the Constitution of the United States--the right to be\r\npresented by a grand jury and tried by a petit jury in the civil\r\ntribunals of the United States, under the ordinary forms and guarantees\r\nof the common law, even though the crime charged should be treason\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The bill in its attempt to rob the President of his office\r\nof Commander-in-chief.]\r\n\r\nIn the second place, the bill undertook to rob the President of his\r\nconstitutional prerogative of commandership-in-chief over the army, and\r\nvest the same in the General of the army. This was so evident that no\r\none could fail to see that it was a bill directed as much against the\r\npowers of the President of the United States as against the late\r\nConfederates of the South.\r\n\r\nAnd in the third place, the bill assumed to suspend the writ of Habeas\r\nCorpus, substantially, while the Constitution forbids this to be done\r\nby any part of the Government of the United States, except in time of\r\nwar or public danger. There was no war, and to say that there was\r\npublic danger of the character meant by the constitutional exception\r\nwas to exaggerate the condition of things entirely beyond all fact or\r\nreason.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The brutality of the measure.]\r\n\r\nThe bill was the most brutal proposition ever introduced into the\r\nCongress of the United States by a responsible committee, and it would\r\nnever have been tolerated except at such a time of partisan excitement\r\nand exaggerated suspicions. Even under such conditions Congress would\r\nnot pass it as introduced, but incorporated into it many modifying\r\nprovisions, most of which, however, while reflecting the honest\r\nsentiments of the lawmakers, give little {115} evidence of good\r\npolitical science or sound constitutional law.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The opposition of conservative Republicans to the bill.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Blaine's proposed changes in the bill.]\r\n\r\nThe two points in the bill which the conservative Republicans were\r\nunable to accept were, first, the establishment of martial law for an\r\nindefinite period and without any provision tor a way of future escape\r\nfrom its rigors; and, second, the usurpation of the President's\r\nconstitutional prerogative of commandership-in-chief of the army. It\r\nsoon became manifest that the bill could not pass without the\r\nintroduction of a clause covering the first point and without a change\r\nof the provision in regard to the second. A number of the conservative\r\nRepublicans had indicated these things, when Mr. Blaine squarely asked\r\nMr. Stevens to incorporate an amendment in the bill which should\r\nprovide a way of escape from the martial rule which the bill proposed\r\nto establish. Mr. Blaine's amendment held out the promise of the\r\nadmission of each of the ten communities now to be thrown into military\r\ndivisions to its proper position as a \"State\" of the Union when it\r\nshould adopt the proposed Fourteenth Amendment and conform its\r\nconstitution and laws thereto, should provide by its constitution for\r\nuniversal male suffrage without regard to race, color or previous\r\ncondition of servitude, and should adopt a constitution with such a\r\nprovision in it by popular vote, and when Congress should approve of\r\nthe said constitution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Criticism of Mr. Blaine's propositions.]\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that all this, while reflecting the good moral\r\nfeeling of Mr. Blaine, was bad political science and was the very\r\ncontradictory of sound constitutional law. As has been pointed out\r\nseveral times already, it would have been good constitutional law had\r\nthe United States Congress simply delayed the admission or readmission\r\n{116} of these communities as \"States\" of the Union until after the\r\nproposed Fourteenth Amendment, and any other desirable amendment,\r\nshould have been framed and adopted. Their admission then would have\r\nbeen into the _same_ Union with all the other States. But to demand of\r\nthem, as the condition of admission, their acceptance of things not yet\r\nin the Constitution of the United States, things not obligatory on the\r\n\"States\" already in the Union, was tantamount to the creation of a new\r\nsort of union with another kind of constitution by an Act of Congress.\r\nThis question had been thoroughly talked out, fought out, and decided\r\nin 1820, and for nearly fifty years it had been the settled principle\r\nof constitutional law that Congress has no such power. It has been also\r\npointed out that a sound political science of the federal system of\r\ngovernment teaches the same principle.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Stevens's refusal to accept Mr. Blaine's amendment.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Passage of the bill by the House.]\r\n\r\nMr. Stevens acted correctly, from the point of view of political\r\nscience and constitutional interpretation, when he declined to accept\r\nMr. Blaine's amendment, or to allow a vote to be taken on it, and the\r\nHouse of Representatives also acted correctly from the same point of\r\nview when it voted down a proposition from Mr. Blaine to send his\r\namendment along with the bill to the Judiciary Committee of the House\r\nwith instruction to report it back with the bill. But it is not to be\r\ninferred from the debates that either Mr. Stevens or the House was\r\nactuated in this course of conduct by the above mentioned\r\nconsiderations. The expansion of the powers of government inevitably\r\nconsequent upon a long period of war seemed to have made them all very\r\nnearly forget that there was anything but government in our political\r\nsystem. The chief thought was that one Congress could not bind another\r\nwith any such promises as those held {117} out in the Blaine amendment,\r\nand that each Congress must at all times be left to its own discretion\r\nin the determination of every question. The House passed the bill as it\r\ncame from the Committee on Reconstruction without change or amendment,\r\nand on the 13th of February it appeared in the Senate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The bill in the Senate.]\r\n\r\nThis more conservative and deliberate body regarded the bill as too\r\nradical, and after considerable debate upon a proposed amendment,\r\noffered first by Senator Williams of Oregon, and then by Senator\r\nReverdy Johnson, which was in substance the Blaine proposition, laid it\r\naside by general consent and allowed Senator Sherman to offer a\r\nsubstitute for it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Sherman substitute.]\r\n\r\nThis substitute contained the gist of the Blaine amendment, and also\r\nchanged the provision which proposed to deprive the President of his\r\nconstitutional prerogative of commandership-in-chief of the army. While\r\nthe bill was thus made a less brutal measure, and in one respect a less\r\nunconstitutional measure, it still rested upon a very shaky foundation\r\nso far as constitutional law was concerned, and it was opposed by all\r\nthe Democratic Senators. It was passed, however, by a large majority,\r\nevery Republican who voted voting in favor of it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The substitute in the House.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Senate substitute rejected by the House.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The bill as finally agreed upon.]\r\n\r\nWhen it was returned to the House of Representatives for concurrence,\r\nthe Radical Republicans developed a most hostile opposition to the\r\nchanges which had been made by the Senate. They claimed that the Senate\r\nbill proposed to bind future Congresses by pledges which the existing\r\nCongress had no right to make and no power to execute, and that it also\r\nproposed to use the rebel element of the population of the South in the\r\nwork of reconstructing loyal \"State\" {118} governments. After a long\r\nand acrid debate, the House rejected the Senate's substitute by a union\r\nof Democratic votes with the votes of the Radical Republicans. This\r\nresult and the manner of its attainment so frightened the Republicans,\r\nhowever, that they quickly came to an understanding among themselves in\r\nthe House, and with their party colleagues in the Senate, and passed\r\nthe Senate's substitute, so amended as to prevent disloyal men, as\r\ndesignated in the proposed Fourteenth Amendment, from voting for\r\ndelegates to a reconstruction convention, or being delegates therein,\r\nor being officers in any so-called \"State\" government before the\r\nadmission of the Senators and Representatives from that \"State\" into\r\nCongress, and so amended further as to pronounce all professed civil\r\ngovernments existing in any of the late so-called Confederate States,\r\nexcept of course Tennessee, provisional only, until Senators and\r\nRepresentatives from the same should be admitted to seats in Congress,\r\nand subject, as provisional governments, to the paramount authority of\r\nthe United States which should control them, and might supersede or\r\nabolish them at any time. The Senate also accepted these amendments,\r\nand on the 20th of February the bill was placed in the hands of the\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The contents of the bill as passed.]\r\n\r\nIt contained the following declarations and provisions. First, the\r\npreamble designated the ten communities reconstructed under the\r\nPresident's direction as \"the rebel States of Virginia, North Carolina,\r\nSouth Carolina, Georgia,\" and so on. This was certainly an untruth. If\r\nthey were \"States\" at all, they certainly were not rebel \"States.\" They\r\nmight with some appearance of correctness and sincerity have been\r\ntermed the late rebel \"States,\" but to be called simply rebel \"States\"\r\nwas, to say the very least, one of the {119} grossest exaggerations to\r\nbe found in the wording of the statutes of Congress. It was simply a\r\nplay on words whereby to justify a dubious procedure. It was at the\r\nvery best, a confounding of the supposed sentiments of the population\r\nof these regions with actual political status. Second, the preamble\r\ndeclared that no legal \"State\" governments or adequate protection for\r\nlife or property existed in these \"rebel States.\" As a legal\r\nproposition the first part of this declaration was true, and as a\r\nmatter of fact the second part was substantially true. It would have\r\nbeen an unprecedented thing if anything like an adequate protection of\r\nlife and property had been re-established, in the short period of two\r\nyears, in communities which had been disturbed, demoralized and\r\ndestroyed by four years of civil war, especially when the outcome of\r\nthe conflict was total defeat and the utter destruction of the basis of\r\nthe old social, political, and economic systems. It was, however, a\r\nserious question whether such a situation required drastic measures\r\nrather than mild and soothing measures.\r\n\r\nThe Republican Congress decided, after much deliberation, that the\r\nformer were necessary to the maintenance of peace and good order, and,\r\ntherefore, enacted that the \"said rebel States\" should be divided into\r\nfive military districts, as previously described in the original bill;\r\nthat the President should assign to the command of each of these an\r\narmy officer of not lower rank than brigadier-general, and place under\r\nhis command a sufficient force to enable him to perform his duties and\r\nexecute his authority in his district; that these commanders should\r\nhave the power to govern these districts by martial law in so far as,\r\nin their judgment, the reign of order and the preservation of the\r\npublic peace might demand, under the limitations simply that \"all\r\npersons put under military arrest {120} by virtue of this act shall be\r\ntried without unnecessary delay, and no cruel or unusual punishment\r\nshall be inflicted, and no sentence of any military commission or\r\ntribunal hereby authorized affecting the life or liberty of any person,\r\nshall be executed until it is approved by the officer in command of the\r\ndistrict--and no sentence of death under the provisions of this act\r\nshall be carried into effect without the approval of the President.\"\r\n\r\nThen came the provision which offered the terms of escape from this new\r\nmilitary régime. They were, first, the exercise of universal manhood\r\nsuffrage, that is the suffrage of all male citizens, twenty-one years\r\nof age, without regard to race, color or previous condition of\r\nservitude, who were not disfranchised for participation in rebellion or\r\nfor felony at common law, and who had resided for one year in the\r\nso-called \"rebel State,\" in the election of delegates to a\r\nconstitutional convention in the so-called \"rebel State\"; second, the\r\nframing of a \"State\" constitution by a convention composed of delegates\r\nso elected, and not disqualified by participation in rebellion or by\r\nthe commission of felony, which constitution should conform in all\r\nrespects to the Constitution of the United States and which should\r\ncontain, as a permanent principle, the same law of suffrage as that\r\nprescribed by this Act for the election of the delegates to the\r\nconvention; third, the ratification of this constitution by a majority\r\nof the voters, as designated by the law of suffrage for the choice of\r\ndelegates to the convention, voting upon the question of ratification;\r\nfourth, the approval by Congress of this constitution; and fifth, and\r\nlast, the adoption of the proposed Fourteenth Amendment to the\r\nConstitution of the United States by the legislature created by such\r\nadopted and approved \"State\" constitution, and by a sufficient number\r\nof the legislatures {121} of other \"States\" to make it a part of the\r\nConstitution of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe measure contained, in the last place, a sort of saving clause in\r\nregard to the existing civil governments which had been established in\r\nall these communities under the direction of the President, and which\r\nwere now to be displaced. It had been already provided, in section\r\nthird, that the military commander of a district might use the existing\r\ncivil courts, if he saw fit to do so, so long as the reign of law and\r\norder might be so preserved, and the final section provided that any\r\ncivil government which might exist in these districts should be\r\nregarded as provisional, and should be in all respects subject to the\r\nparamount authority of the United States, which should control, and\r\nmight abolish, modify, or supersede the same, and that the voters for\r\nthe election of the officers of such provisional governments should be\r\nrequired to have only the qualifications prescribed in this Act for\r\nvoters for the delegates to the said \"State\" convention, and persons\r\nelected to place and office in such provisional governments must not\r\nhave the disqualifications prescribed in the proposed Fourteenth\r\nAmendment to the Constitution of the United States. It had evidently\r\noccurred to the Republican leaders that they might have to make use of\r\nsome of the machinery of the existing civil governments established\r\nunder the direction of the President in these regions in executing\r\ntheir own plan of Reconstruction.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The condition that the proposed Fourteenth Amendment be\r\nratified by a sufficient number of \"States\" to make it a part of the\r\nConstitution.]\r\n\r\nAll of the points of the measure have been commented on, except the\r\nprovision in the fifth section, which makes the adoption of the\r\nproposed Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States\r\nby a number of \"States\" sufficient to ratify it a condition precedent\r\nto the admission of any one of these so-called \"rebel States\" to\r\nrepresentation in Congress. The {122} adoption of the proposed\r\namendment by the particular \"rebel State\" seeking representation was\r\nnot sufficient. It must be ratified by at least three-fourths of all\r\nthe \"States.\" No matter how speedily and sincerely the legislature of\r\nVirginia might ratify the proposed Amendment, and fulfil all the other\r\nconditions required by the Act, Virginia must remain under military\r\ndespotism until a very large number of the Northern \"State\"\r\nlegislatures had pleased to ratify the proposed Amendment. This was\r\ncertainly a pretty hard condition, and it was not a very fair way of\r\nforcing the legislatures of the Northern States to adopt the proposed\r\nAmendment. It was, however, an efficient weapon, and Congress had the\r\nlegal power to use it. It was unconscionable, though it was one of the\r\nthings about this measure which was constitutional.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Tenure-of-Office bill.]\r\n\r\nHand in hand with this bill went another measure, the purpose of which\r\nwas to limit the customary power of the President, if not his\r\nconstitutional power, over the civil official system, the so-called\r\nTenure-of-Office bill. On the first day of the session, December 3d,\r\n1866, Mr. Williams of Oregon introduced this bill in the Senate, while\r\nat the same moment a bill was introduced and passed in the House\r\nrepealing that section of the Confiscation Act of July 17th, 1862,\r\nwhich authorized the President to extend pardon and amnesty by\r\nproclamation to persons participating in the rebellion. The Senate\r\npassed the latter bill or resolution on the 8th of January, 1867, and\r\nthe President, not considering that the Congress could either give or\r\ntake away his power to pardon secured to him by the Constitution,\r\nsimply pocketed the resolution, and it became a law on and from the\r\n21st of January, having been presented to the President on the 9th.\r\n\r\n{123} The propositions contained in the Tenure-of-Office bill were,\r\nhowever, of a very different significance. There was no clause in the\r\nConstitution which by express literal grant vested the power to dismiss\r\nfrom office in the President, but the clause which made the President\r\nsolely responsible for the execution of the laws was interpreted by the\r\nfirst Congress as doing so. Madison took the ground that the President\r\nmust have this power in order to secure the necessary obedience in his\r\nsubordinates, and declared that the convention which framed the\r\nConstitution so understood it and so intended it. This is certainly\r\nsound political science and correct constitutional interpretation. It\r\nhad also been the practice of the Government from the beginning. The\r\nWhigs had undertaken to reverse it in their contest with Jackson, and\r\nWebster had given his opinion that good political science required that\r\ndismissal from office should be treated as an incident of appointment,\r\nand should be effected in the same manner as appointment, i.e., with\r\nthe concurrence of the Senate, and that the decision of 1789 on this\r\nsubject was, in his opinion, erroneous from the point of view of a\r\nproper interpretation of the Constitution as well. But the Whigs did\r\nnot succeed, as we have seen, in their attempt to break down\r\nPresidential prerogative and introduce parliamentary government, and\r\nthe practice of the Government on this subject remained, after, as\r\nbefore, the fourth decade of the century, the same.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The reasons for the Tenure-of-Office bill.]\r\n\r\nDuring the experiences of the years 1865 and 1866 the Republicans\r\nfeared that the President would use this great power of dismissal from\r\noffice in order to make the entire official system solid with himself\r\non the subject of Reconstruction, and toward the end of 1866 they\r\nsuspected and asserted that he was dismissing officers {124} from their\r\npositions simply on the ground of a difference of opinion with himself\r\non this subject, and they professed to believe that he would make a\r\nclean sweep of all such as soon as Congress should adjourn. There is\r\nlittle doubt that excessive partisan feeling made them exaggerate\r\ngreatly what the President had done and what he intended to do. The\r\nPresident was guided by Mr. Seward in all public matters except his\r\nimprudent speeches, and Seward's conservative and diplomatic\r\ndisposition and methods were all against any such radical and reckless\r\nprocedure. Besides, it was the constitutional right of the President to\r\nrequire obedience in their official acts from his subordinates, and to\r\ndismiss them when in his opinion their views of policy interfered with\r\nthe discharge of their official duties as he required them to be\r\ndischarged. The Thirty-ninth Congress, however, resolved to disregard\r\nthe precedents set by all of its predecessors and to dispute the\r\nPresident's prerogative of control over the tenure of his subordinates.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The contents of the bill.]\r\n\r\nThe bill drafted for this purpose made the removal of all officers,\r\nappointed by and with the consent of the Senate, except only members of\r\nthe President's Cabinet, subject to the consent of the Senate. This\r\nconsent might be given in the form of a ratification of the nomination\r\nof a successor to any officer. It allowed the President, during a\r\nrecess of the Senate, the power of suspension for misconduct in office,\r\ncrime, legal disqualification or incapacity, and of making appointment\r\nof a suitable person to discharge temporarily the duties of such\r\nsuspended officer, but it required of the President a report of all\r\nsuch suspensions to the Senate within the first twenty days of the next\r\nmeeting of the Senate, with the reasons therefor, and reinstated the\r\nsuspended officer in case the Senate {125} should not concur in the\r\nsuspension. If the Senate should concur, the President must remove the\r\nofficer, and appoint, with the advice and consent of the Senate,\r\nanother person in his place.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Discussion of the bill.]\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of the present this would seem, in all\r\nconscience, to have been a sufficient usurpation of the President's\r\nconstitutional powers to have satisfied the most radical and reckless\r\ninterpretation of the organic law. But the bill had hardly come under\r\ndiscussion when Senator Howe moved to strike out the clause excepting\r\nthe Cabinet officers from its operation, and although the Senate\r\nrefused to pass this amendment, the House of Representatives did so\r\nwhen the bill came before it. The Senate, however, refused to concur on\r\nthe ground, of course, that the intimate and confidential relations\r\nwhich should exist between the President and the members of his Cabinet\r\nmade it necessary that the President should have only the men of his\r\nown choice in these positions. The strenuous insistence of the House,\r\nhowever, forced the Senate to a compromise upon the subject, and the\r\nbill was finally made to provide that the members of the Cabinet should\r\n\"hold their offices, respectively, for and during the term of the\r\nPresident by whom they have been appointed, and for one month\r\nthereafter, subject to removal by and with the consent of the Senate.\"\r\nThat is, that a Cabinet officer might hold his position against the\r\nwill of the President who appointed him during the entire term of the\r\nPresident and for one month of the term of his successor unless the\r\nSenate should agree to such officer's removal either directly or by\r\nratification of the nomination of a successor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The provisions for enforcing the measure.]\r\n\r\nThe bill as finally enacted contained, moreover, the most stringent\r\nprovisions for its enforcement. It made {126} the acceptance or\r\nexercise of any office or the attempt to exercise any office contrary\r\nto the Act a high misdemeanor, punishable by a maximum fine of ten\r\nthousand dollars or a maximum imprisonment of five years, or both in\r\nthe discretion of the court; and it made the removal, appointment, or\r\nemployment of any officer contrary to the provisions of the Act, or the\r\npreparation, signing, sealing, countersigning or issuing of any\r\ncommission of office or letter of authority in respect to any such\r\nappointment or employment high misdemeanors, punishable with the same\r\nextreme penalties. Lastly, it forbade the officers of the Treasury and\r\nall officers of the United States to pay any money, salary or\r\ncompensation to any person claiming to hold any office or employment\r\ncontrary to the provisions of this Act, and made the violation of this\r\norder a high misdemeanor, punishable with the same extreme penalties as\r\nin the other cases.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The President's vetoes of these bills.]\r\n\r\nThis monstrous measure went to the President on the same day with the\r\nReconstruction bill, the 20th of February. It is not to be wondered at\r\nthat he felt that the Republican chiefs were offering him intentional\r\npersonal insult, as well as that the legislative department of the\r\nGovernment was attempting an unwarranted encroachment upon the\r\nconstitutional prerogatives of the Executive. It is rather to be\r\nwondered at that, in his message to Congress on these subjects, he\r\nsucceeded so well in ignoring the personal affronts intended by\r\nCongress, and in confining himself so closely to a discussion of the\r\npublic questions and considerations involved in the measures.\r\n\r\nThe vetoes of these bills were sent to Congress on the same day, March\r\n2d. To the publicist and historian of this day they are masterpieces of\r\npolitical logic, constitutional interpretation, and official style. If\r\nnot {127} written by Mr. Seward, they must have been edited and revised\r\nby him. These documents showed most convincingly, both from\r\nconstitutional provisions, opinions of contemporaries, statutes of\r\nCongress, judicial decisions, and the uniform practices of the\r\nGovernment, that Congress had no power to establish or re-establish\r\nmartial law anywhere in the country, except when and where war or armed\r\nrebellion existed as a fact, a condition which did not then exist\r\nanywhere in the length and breadth of the land; and that Congress had\r\nno power to force the President to retain agents and subordinates in\r\noffice against his judgment and will. No good political scientist and\r\nno sound constitutional lawyer will, at this day, disagree with the\r\ncontention of the President upon these two points, and it is very\r\ndifficult to understand how the great leaders of the Republican party\r\ncould, at that day, have differed with him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Republican motives in Reconstruction.]\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, in some of the baser minds among them, the determination\r\nto create Republican party \"States\" in the South was a very weighty\r\nconsideration, but just as undoubtedly the consideration with the\r\nmajority of them was the conviction that the work of the four years of\r\nwar might have to be done all over again unless a new political people,\r\na new body of suffrage holders, should be created at the South, whose\r\nmembers had never been disloyal. But even from this point of view\r\nagain, it is difficult to understand how they could have failed to see\r\nthat the Constitution required that this should be done through the\r\nforms of Territorial civil government, instead of through the forms of\r\nmartial law. Put the best light upon their conduct that is possible,\r\nthere is still left the conviction that the fanaticism of extreme\r\npartisanship had an undue influence over them all. {128} The contest\r\nwith the President had blinded their perceptions as to the morality,\r\nlegality and propriety of the means they were willing to employ in\r\nsecuring the victory over him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Congressional encroachment on the President's military\r\nprerogatives.]\r\n\r\nAs this contest developed it dwarfed, to say the least, all other\r\nconsiderations. Even as late as when the Reconstruction bill was\r\npassed, the majority of the Republicans refused to vote to take the\r\nPresident's military prerogatives from him. In less than a fortnight\r\nfrom this time, however, they voted, in a section of the Army\r\nAppropriation bill, \"that the head-quarters of the General of the army\r\nof the United States shall be at the city of Washington, and all orders\r\nand instructions relating to military operations issued by the\r\nPresident or Secretary of War shall be issued through the General of\r\nthe army, and, in case of his inability, through the next in rank. The\r\nGeneral of the army shall not be removed, suspended, or relieved from\r\ncommand, or assigned to duty elsewhere than at said head-quarters,\r\nexcept at his own request, without the previous approval of the Senate;\r\nand any orders or instructions relating to military operations issued\r\ncontrary to the requirements of this section shall be null and void;\r\nand any officer who shall issue orders or instructions contrary to the\r\nprovisions of this section shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor in\r\noffice; and any officer of the army who shall transmit, convey, or obey\r\nany orders or instructions so issued contrary to the provisions of this\r\nsection, knowing that such orders were so issued, shall be liable to\r\nimprisonment for not less than two nor more than twenty years, upon\r\nconviction in any court of competent jurisdiction.\"\r\n\r\nTo the mind of any unprejudiced constitutional lawyer, at the present\r\nday, this act must appear as a gross {129} usurpation by Congress of\r\nthe President's military powers conferred upon him by the Constitution.\r\nThe Constitution makes the President the Commander-in-Chief of the army\r\nand navy, and gives Congress no power whatsoever over the methods or\r\nchannels by, and through, which he may issue his military commands.\r\nNeither does the Constitution give Congress any power to assign any of\r\nthe officers or troops of the army to any particular position. These\r\nare all functions of the commandership-in-chief, and, unless expressly\r\ngranted by the Constitution to some other department of the Government,\r\nbelong to the President.\r\n\r\nIt was not only a usurpation by Congress to pass such an act, but it\r\nwas a mean thing to do it as a section of an appropriation bill; and\r\nthere is no escaping the suspicion that it had a sinister purpose,\r\nnamely, to entrap the President in the commission of what Congress had\r\nmade a high misdemeanor, and open the way for his impeachment and\r\nexpulsion from office. The President signed this bill, however, in\r\norder to save the appropriations for the support of the army, although\r\nhe protested strongly against the seizure of his constitutional powers\r\nby the Congress.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The supplementary Reconstruction bill.]\r\n\r\nOn the same day that the vetoes of the Reconstruction bill and the\r\nTenure-of-Office bill were sent to Congress, this body passed a bill\r\nsupplementary to the first measure. It was in the nature of an\r\nadministrative measure for the purpose of carrying out the new plan of\r\nReconstruction. It ordered the commanding generals of the respective\r\ndistricts to cause a registration to be made before September 1st next\r\nfollowing of all male citizens of the United States, twenty-one years\r\nof age and over, resident in each county or parish in the \"State\" or\r\n\"States\" included in their respective districts, who were qualified as\r\n{130} prescribed by the Reconstruction Act to vote for delegates to a\r\nconstitutional convention, and who had taken an oath asserting\r\ncitizenship and residence, and freedom from disfranchisement on account\r\nof participation in rebellion or the commission of felony, and had\r\nsworn that they had never engaged in insurrection or rebellion against\r\nthe United States, or given aid and comfort to the enemies of the\r\nUnited States after having been members of Congress or of a \"State\"\r\nlegislature, or officers of the United States or of a \"State\" of the\r\nUnion, and that they would henceforth faithfully support the\r\nConstitution and obey the laws of the United States and encourage\r\nothers to do so.\r\n\r\nIt next made it the duty of the commanding generals to order elections,\r\nat such times after the completion of the registrations and at such\r\nplaces as they might choose, for delegates to constitutional\r\nconventions in the \"States\" comprised in their respective districts. It\r\nrequired them to give thirty days' notice of the elections, and it\r\nfixed the number of delegates to each convention at the number of\r\nmembers in the lower House of the legislature of the \"State\" concerned\r\nin the year 1860, except in the case of Virginia, where, on account of\r\nthe separation of West Virginia from the old Commonwealth, the number\r\nof deputies to the Virginia convention was made to correspond with the\r\nnumber of members in the lower House of the legislature of 1860,\r\nrepresenting the territory not included in West Virginia. The bill\r\nfurther directed the commanding generals to distribute the\r\nrepresentation in the conventions among the districts, counties and\r\nparishes of the \"States\" in accordance with the number of registered\r\nvoters in each.\r\n\r\nThe bill then provided that at the elections for delegates, the voters\r\nshould vote on the question as to {131} whether there should be a\r\nconstitutional convention or not, and that such convention should be\r\nheld only when a majority of the inscribed electors voted upon this\r\nquestion, and a majority of those voting voted in the affirmative. It\r\nthen ordered the commanding generals, in case the voters did so decide\r\nfor conventions and elect delegates thereto, to call such within sixty\r\ndays from the date of the elections, and to notify the delegates to\r\nassemble at a given time and place, and frame constitutions according\r\nto the provisions of the bill and of the former Act to which it was\r\nsupplementary, and, when framed, to submit the same to the registered\r\nvoters for ratification with a notice of thirty days.\r\n\r\nThe bill then further provided, that if, at such elections, a majority\r\nof the registered voters voted upon the question of ratification, and a\r\nmajority of those voting voted in favor of ratification, the presidents\r\nof the respective conventions should transmit copies of the respective\r\nconstitutions to the President of the United States, who should\r\ntransmit them to Congress, and that Congress should declare the\r\nrespective \"States,\" whose conventions had framed these constitutions\r\nand whose voters had adopted them, entitled to representation in\r\nCongress, provided Congress was satisfied that there had been perfectly\r\nfree elections, and that no force, fraud or intimidation had been\r\nperpetrated at them, and that the constitutions presented met the\r\napproval of a majority of the qualified electors and were in conformity\r\nwith the requirements of the Reconstruction Act.\r\n\r\nFinally, the bill put into the hands of the commanding generals the\r\nappointment of the officers of the elections, and the control of the\r\nmachinery of the elections, only requiring them to hold the elections\r\nby {132} ballot, and to proclaim the results of the elections in\r\naccordance with the returns made to them by their boards of\r\nregistration.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Congress in permanence.]\r\n\r\nCongress had passed a resolution ordering the assembly of the Fortieth\r\nCongress so soon as the Thirty-ninth expired, and in accordance\r\ntherewith the newly elected Congress opened its session on the 4th of\r\nMarch, 1867, instead of on the first Monday of the following December.\r\nThe Congress was, therefore, in position to deal at once with a veto of\r\nthe supplemental bill to the Reconstruction Act, in case one should be\r\nsent in.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The veto of the supplemental Reconstruction bill.]\r\n\r\nOn the 23d of March the veto appeared. The President argued that the\r\noath required by the bill from every person before his name could be\r\nadmitted to registration, viz., \"that he had not been disfranchised for\r\nparticipation in any rebellion or civil war against the United States,\"\r\nwas so entirely uncertain in its meaning that it would prove a most\r\nterrible means of oppression in the hands of the military officers and\r\ntheir appointed agents, and declared he could never approve of an\r\nelection law whose plain and manifest purpose was to disfranchise the\r\ngreat body of respectable white people, and create a new electorate on\r\nthe basis of universal negro suffrage. He contended that the existing\r\nconstitutions of the ten \"States\" to be re-reconstructed conformed to\r\nthe long-established standards of loyalty and Republicanism, and that\r\nthe new test of these qualities now set up by Congress, viz., universal\r\nnegro suffrage, was a gross exaggeration, and would make many of the\r\nNorthern \"States\" themselves unrepublican. The President did not\r\nexpressly say that this bill was unconstitutional, but he quite\r\ndistinctly implied it. In this, however, he was wrong, unless his\r\ndoctrine that the rebellious {133} communities remained \"States\" of the\r\nUnion throughout the rebellion, or had been reconstructed by his plan,\r\nwas true, that is, unless these communities were \"States\" of the Union\r\nat the time Congress passed this bill.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Criticism of the veto.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, from the point of view of the correct legal\r\nprinciple in regard to this subject, the principle which holds that the\r\nresult of general rebellion within a \"State\" against the Constitution\r\nand laws of the United States is the loss of the \"State\" form of local\r\ngovernment, and brings the territory and population of the former\r\n\"State\" under the exclusive jurisdiction of the central Government,\r\nCongress certainly had, and has, the power to create the electorate in\r\nsuch territory at its own discretion, Congress was referred, and is\r\nreferred, in such a case, only to its own sense of right and policy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Criticism of the Reconstruction Acts.]\r\n\r\nBut there is no question, now, that Congress did a monstrous thing, and\r\ncommitted a great political error, if not a sin, in the creation of\r\nthis new electorate. It was a great wrong to civilization to put the\r\nwhite race of the South under the domination of the negro race. The\r\nclaim that there is nothing in the color of the skin from the point of\r\nview of political ethics is a great sophism. A black skin means\r\nmembership in a race of men which has never of itself succeeded in\r\nsubjecting passion to reason, has never, therefore, created any\r\ncivilization of any kind. To put such a race of men in possession of a\r\n\"State\" government in a system of federal government is to trust them\r\nwith the development of political and legal civilization upon the most\r\nimportant subjects of human life, and to do this in communities with a\r\nlarge white population is simply to establish barbarism in power over\r\ncivilization. The supposed disloyalty, or even the actual disloyalty,\r\nof {134} the white population will not justify this. It will justify\r\nthe indefinite withholding of the \"State\" form of local government. It\r\nwill justify the throwing of a \"State\" of the Union back under the form\r\nof a Territory of the Union. It will even justify the establishment of\r\nmartial law. But it is not to be cured, nor is the welfare of the whole\r\nland, or any part of it, to be promoted, by the subjection of the white\r\nrace to the black race in politics and government. It was a great wrong\r\nto the negroes themselves. It made the white men among whom they must\r\nlive their most bitter enemies, when they most needed them for friends,\r\nand it made the negroes trifling and corrupt politicians, when they\r\nshould have been devoting themselves exclusively to the acquirement of\r\nproperty and education. It was argued, as will be well remembered, that\r\nthey could not acquire property and education without the ballot. But\r\nthis is another sophism. The mainstay of property is the courts; and\r\nunder a Territorial form of local government Congress could have\r\nestablished a system of free schools. It was not at all necessary to\r\nhave recourse to negro suffrage and negro \"State\" governments in order\r\nto secure the negroes in their personal liberty, and the possession of\r\nproperty, and to aid them in the acquirement of education.\r\n\r\nThere was another alternative, and a better one. In fact, there were\r\ntwo other conceivable ways of doing these things, either of which would\r\nhave been better than the one chosen. The one was, as has been already\r\nsuggested, to establish Territorial civil governments in the late\r\nrebellious region and maintain them there until the civil relations\r\nbetween the two races became settled and fixed. The other was to so\r\namend the Constitution of the United States, before the readmission of\r\nthe \"States\" which had renounced the \"State\" form of local {135}\r\ngovernment under the Union, as to give Congress and the national\r\njudiciary the power to define and defend the fundamental principles of\r\ncivil liberty. Neither of these methods would have demanded martial law\r\nor universal negro suffrage. It is entirely surprising, from the point\r\nof view of to-day, that one or the other of these methods or a\r\ncombination of both was not resorted to, instead of the monstrous plan\r\nthat was carried out. There is no way to explain this sufficiently,\r\nexcept upon the reflection that the passions of the men of that day had\r\nbecome so inflamed and so completely dominating that they obscured\r\nreason, drowned the voice of prudence, and even dulled the sense of\r\ndecency. There were a few who favored universal negro suffrage from an\r\nexalted and exaggerated humanitarianism, but the mass of the\r\nRepublicans sustained it as a punishment to the late rebellious whites,\r\nand as a means of establishing Republican party \"State\" governments in\r\nthe South. Many claimed, indeed, that it was the only alternative to\r\nlong-continued martial law rule, but they were either very ignorant or\r\nvery insincere.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The assignment of the commanding generals to the military\r\ndistricts created by the Reconstruction Acts.]\r\n\r\nIn prompt obedience to the requirements of the two Reconstruction Acts,\r\nthe President issued his general order through the Adjutant-General's\r\noffice, on March 11th, assigning General Schofield to the command of\r\nthe first military district, as created by these Acts, with his\r\nhead-quarters at Richmond, Virginia; General Sickles to that of the\r\nsecond, with his head-quarters at Columbia, South Carolina; General\r\nThomas to that of the third, with his head-quarters at Montgomery,\r\nAlabama; General Ord to that of the fourth, with his head-quarters at\r\nVicksburg, Mississippi; and General Sheridan to that of the fifth, with\r\nhis head-quarters at New {136} Orleans, Louisiana. On the 15th this\r\norder was so modified as to change the assignment of General Thomas\r\nfrom the command of the third district to that of the Department of the\r\nCumberland, and to substitute General Pope for him in the command of\r\nthe third district.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The re-establishment of martial law in the South.]\r\n\r\nThese officers betook themselves at once, with the forces attached to\r\ntheir several commands, to their respective stations, and assumed the\r\ngovernment of their respective districts by martial law. No opposition\r\nwhatever was made to any of them by the populations thus made subject\r\nto their despotic rule.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The President's instructions to the generals in\r\ninterpretation of the Reconstruction Acts.]\r\n\r\nVery soon, however, the generals found great difficulty in interpreting\r\nthe Reconstruction Acts, especially in respect to the oath required for\r\nenfranchisement, both as to the persons who might take it and as to its\r\nconsequences, and in respect to the powers of the boards appointed to\r\nsuperintend the elections. They applied to the President for\r\ninformation upon these points. The President submitted their\r\napplication to his Attorney-General and to his Cabinet, and with the\r\nfull concurrence of all the members thereof, except only Mr. Stanton,\r\nissued through the Adjutant-General's office in the War Department, on\r\nthe 20th of June, the following instructions:\r\n\r\nFirst: That the oath prescribed in the second Act defined all the\r\nqualifications required for suffrage, and that any person who could\r\ntake that oath should have his name entered on the list of voters; that\r\nthe boards of registration provided in that Act could not require any\r\nother, or any additional, oath from the person applying for\r\nregistration, nor \"administer an oath to any other person touching the\r\nqualification of the applicant or {137} the falsity of the oath taken\r\nby him,\" but that the person taking the oath must be registered as a\r\nvoter, and if it could be afterward proved that he had sworn falsely,\r\nhe could be punished for perjury.\r\n\r\nSecond: That an unnaturalized alien could not take the oath, but a\r\nnaturalized alien could, and that no other proof of naturalization\r\ncould be required of him.\r\n\r\nThird: That \"actual participation in rebellion or the actual commission\r\nof a felony\" did not amount to disfranchisement, but there must be a\r\nlaw made by competent authority declaring disfranchisement, or a\r\njudicial sentence inflicting it, and that no law of the United States\r\nhad declared the penalty of disfranchisement for participating in\r\nrebellion alone.\r\n\r\nFourth: That a person who had engaged in rebellion, but had not\r\ntheretofore held an office under a \"State\" or the United States, or not\r\nbeen a member of a \"State\" legislature or of Congress, and not taken,\r\nas such, an oath to support the Constitution of the United States, was\r\nnot disfranchised or disqualified from voting.\r\n\r\nFifth: That persons who were militia officers in any \"State\" prior to\r\nthe rebellion were not disfranchised by participating in the rebellion.\r\n\r\nSixth: That \"an act to fix upon the person the offence of engaging in\r\nrebellion under this law must be an overt and voluntary act, done with\r\nthe intent of aiding or furthering the common unlawful purpose,\" and\r\nthat \"a person forced into the rebel service by conscription or under a\r\nparamount authority which he could not safely disobey, and who would\r\nnot have entered such service if left to the free exercise of his own\r\nwill,\" was not disfranchised or disqualified from voting.\r\n\r\nAnd lastly: That disloyal sentiments, opinions or sympathies, or\r\nanything said or written which fell short {138} of an incitement to\r\nothers to engage in rebellion, did not disfranchise or disqualify from\r\nvoting.\r\n\r\nSome other instructions were given which were concurred in by the\r\nentire Cabinet, Mr. Stanton included, but the recital of them is not\r\nessential to this narrative. It must be added, however, that the\r\nPresident's view of the relation of the military commanders to the\r\n\"State\" governments created under his direction and with his aid was\r\none which gave these governments a more independent and permanent\r\ncharacter than the language of the Reconstruction Acts seemed to\r\nwarrant.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Congressional interpretation of the Reconstruction\r\nActs.]\r\n\r\nWhen, then, the instructions of June 20th to the generals became known,\r\nanother bill was introduced into Congress and passed which put the\r\nCongressional interpretation upon the Reconstruction Acts.\r\n\r\nIt declared that the true intent and meaning of these Acts was that the\r\ncivil governments then existing in the \"rebel States\" of Virginia,\r\nNorth Carolina, etc., were not legal \"State governments,\" and that, if\r\nthereafter they should be allowed to continue to exist at all, they\r\nmust be subject in all respects to the will of the military commanders\r\nof the respective districts, and to the paramount authority of\r\nCongress; and it provided that the generals in command of the\r\nrespective districts might suspend or remove any person from any office\r\nunder these illegal and pretended governments, and detail or appoint\r\nsome other person to discharge the duties and exercise the powers said\r\nto pertain to such office. The acts of the district commanders in\r\nregard to these things were made subject to the disapproval of the\r\nGeneral of the army, but not to that of the President, and stood until\r\nso disapproved. The same powers in regard to these matters were vested,\r\nby this bill, in the General of the army as in the district commanders,\r\n{139} but were not accorded by it to the President; and it was made the\r\nduty of the General of the army and the district commanders to remove\r\nfrom such pretended offices \"all persons who were disloyal to the\r\nUnited States, or who used their official influence in any manner to\r\nhinder, delay, prevent, or obstruct the due and proper administration\r\nof the Reconstruction Acts.\"\r\n\r\nThe bill, furthermore, provided that the boards of registration should\r\nhave the power, and that it should be their duty, to ascertain the fact\r\nas to whether a person applying for registration as a voter was\r\nentitled to registration under the Reconstruction Acts, and to refuse\r\nregistration, if in their judgment he was not, and that the fact that\r\nhe was willing to take the oath prescribed in the Reconstruction Acts,\r\nor had taken it, was not conclusive upon the registration boards in\r\nmaking their inquiries and forming their decisions. And it, finally,\r\ndeclared that the true intent and meaning of the oath prescribed in the\r\nReconstruction Acts for persons who had held office under a \"State\"\r\ngovernment or membership in a \"State\" legislature, before the\r\nrebellion, was that whether such persons were holding such positions at\r\nthe time of the commencement of the rebellion or at some time prior to\r\nthe same, and whether they had taken an oath to support the\r\nConstitution of the United States or not, they were disqualified from\r\nregistration and were disfranchised, if, after holding such positions,\r\nthey had \"engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United\r\nStates, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof\"; and it gave to\r\nthe commanders of the districts the power to extend, in their\r\ndiscretion, the time for completing the original registration of the\r\nvoters, as provided for in the Reconstruction Acts, to October 1st\r\nfollowing, and to the boards of registration the power, and imposed\r\nupon them the {140} duty, to revise, during the first five of the last\r\nfourteen days before any election under the Reconstruction Acts, the\r\nregistration lists and to strike off any name from said lists which, in\r\ntheir judgment, ought not to be there, and to add any name, which, in\r\ntheir judgment, ought to be there, and required them to disregard any\r\nExecutive pardon or amnesty as relieving the disability of any person\r\nfor registration, if such person had committed any act which without\r\nsuch pardon or amnesty would disqualify him.\r\n\r\nThis bill, it will be readily seen, was a wholesale repudiation of all\r\nthe instructions given by the President to the generals in command of\r\nthe districts from which, in the Cabinet council, Mr. Stanton had\r\ndissented. The President immediately realized this, of course, and it\r\nincreased his distrust of Stanton immensely. From that moment forward\r\nhe regarded him as the spy of Congress upon all his official acts, and\r\nhe was resolved to remove him upon the first opportunity, that is, so\r\nsoon as Congress should adjourn.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The President's veto of the bill interpreting the\r\nReconstruction Acts.]\r\n\r\nThe bill passed the Houses on the 13th of July, was presented to the\r\nPresident for his signature on the 14th, and on the 19th he returned it\r\nwith a veto message to the House of Representatives. The President\r\ncontended in his argument that this new measure was not simply an\r\ninterpretation of the existing Reconstruction Acts, but was in many\r\nrespects a large advance upon them. The existing Acts, he contended,\r\nmade the reconstructed \"State\" governments at the South subject to\r\nabsolute military authority in many important respects, but not in all\r\nrespects, while the new measure proposed to extend the despotism of the\r\nmilitary commanders over everything. Against such a measure, in time of\r\npeace, he protested as being in violation of every guaranty of {141}\r\nindividual liberty contained in the Constitution. He dwelt upon the\r\nunfitness of military officers to discharge the duties and exercise the\r\npowers pertaining naturally to civil office, and he pointed out the\r\ninconsistency, as he thought, of the declaration of Congress that the\r\nten \"State\" governments at the South were illegal with the attempt of\r\nCongress to carry on these _illegal_ \"State\" governments by \"Federal\r\nagency,\" when Congress had no power to carry on a _legal_ \"State\"\r\ngovernment through \"Federal agency\"; and he stopped, as he thought, the\r\nway of escape from this argument by pointing out that the entire\r\nlegislation of Congress down to the passage of the Reconstruction Acts\r\ndistinctly involved the recognition of the ten communities now to be\r\nput under absolute military rule in all respects as \"States\" of the\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nBut the most vigorous and unanswerable part of the message was the\r\nprotest against the robbery of the constitutional powers of the\r\nExecutive by the attempt of Congress, in this measure, to confer some\r\nof those powers upon other persons. The President expressed himself so\r\nwarmly upon this point, that the Republicans began to whisper around\r\ntheir suspicions of sinister purposes on his part, just as if such a\r\ndeclaration to Congress itself was not proof to the contrary. He said:\r\n\"Whilst I hold the chief executive authority of the United States,\r\nwhilst the obligation rests upon me to see that all the laws are\r\nfaithfully executed, I can never willingly surrender that trust or the\r\npowers given for its execution. I can never give my assent to be made\r\nresponsible for the faithful execution of laws, and at the same time\r\nsurrender that trust and the powers which accompany it to any other\r\nexecutive officer, high or low, or to any number of executive officers.\r\nIf this executive trust, vested by the Constitution in the President,\r\nis to be taken from him {142} and vested in a subordinate officer, the\r\nresponsibility will be with Congress in clothing the subordinate with\r\nunconstitutional power and with the officer who assumes its exercise.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ideas and suspicions about the meaning of the message.]\r\n\r\nThe radical Republicans interpreted this language, at once, as meaning\r\nthat the President proposed to so interfere with the execution of the\r\nReconstruction Acts as to avoid their intent and destroy their effect.\r\nAnd the talk about impeachment was again revived. The President,\r\nhowever, meant nothing of the kind, and but for exaggerated suspicion\r\nand party hatred the language of the message would have been held to\r\nmean only an appeal to Congress to desist from its unlawful attempt to\r\nrob the Executive of his constitutional powers, and to the people to\r\nelect men to Congress who would obey the principles of the Constitution\r\nin their legislative acts.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The veto overridden.]\r\n\r\nThe Houses passed the bill over the President's veto immediately, by an\r\noverwhelming majority, and almost in a spirit of derision. The next\r\nday, July 20th, Congress adjourned to the 21st of the following\r\nNovember.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The suspension of Stanton from office.]\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate relations of Mr. Stanton with the President, and with\r\nthe other members of the Cabinet were the thing which was destined to\r\nproduce the catastrophe. He had become unbearable to the President, and\r\nto the most of his colleagues. He ought in all decency to have resigned\r\nhis portfolio as Speed and Harlan and Dennison had done the year\r\nbefore. The President asked him to resign in a note of the 5th of\r\nAugust. Stanton, feeling sure of the support of the large majority in\r\nCongress, contemptuously refused. The President could now in the recess\r\nof Congress suspend him without violating the provisions of the\r\nTenure-of-Office Act, or raising the {143} question of its\r\nconstitutionality. The President at last resolved to take the matter\r\ninto his own hands and rid himself of Stanton's presence in his\r\nconfidential counsels. On the 12th of August he sent an executive order\r\nto Stanton suspending him from the office of Secretary of War, and\r\nanother to General Grant authorizing and empowering him to act as\r\nSecretary of War _ad interim_. Stanton yielded to this order under\r\nprotest. He wrote the President that he could not legally suspend him\r\nfrom office and declared that he submitted only to superior physical\r\nforce. Grant accepted the appointment, although he had, four days\r\nbefore, advised the President against disturbing Stanton. Grant entered\r\nupon the duties of the office at once, and Stanton went off to New\r\nEngland to recuperate health, spirits and courage for his battle with\r\nthe President which was bound to come unless the President should yield\r\nand take him back again, so soon as Congress should assemble.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Changes among the commanders of the military districts.]\r\n\r\nBy a series of orders issued during the same month (August) General\r\nHancock was substituted for General Sheridan in the command of the\r\nfifth military district and General Canby for General Sickles in the\r\ncommand of the second district. Both of the generals thus relieved were\r\ngreat favorites at the North, especially Sheridan. The President felt\r\nthat they were too much imbued with the military spirit to make good\r\nadministrators of civil affairs. But the people of the North saw in\r\nthese changes only the purpose of the President to place his political\r\nfriends among the army officers in command of the military districts,\r\nand through them to modify the intent of the Reconstruction Acts in the\r\ncourse of their execution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{144}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE EXECUTION OF THE RECONSTRUCTION ACTS\r\n\r\nThe Attempt to Prevent the Execution of the Reconstruction Acts in\r\nMississippi and Georgia--The Case of Mississippi vs. Johnson--The Case\r\nof Georgia vs. Stanton--The Operations of the Commanders--The\r\nRegistration--The Numbers Registered--The Change in the Electorate in\r\nthe South--The Elections--Efforts of the Commanders to Get the Vote\r\nOut--The Result of the Elections--The Character of the Convention\r\nDelegates Chosen--The Work of the Conventions--The Vote upon\r\nRatification--Fraudulent Voting and Unlawful Voting--The Recall of Pope\r\nand the Appointment of Meade in His Stead--Rejection of the\r\nConstitution in Alabama--The Statute of Congress Changing the\r\nProportion of Votes to Registration in the Ratification of a\r\nConstitution--Criticism of the Statute--Ratification in\r\nArkansas--Ratification in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia,\r\nFlorida and Louisiana--Second Attempt in Georgia to Obstruct\r\nReconstruction--Rejection of the Constitution in Mississippi.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The attempt to prevent the execution of the Reconstruction\r\nActs in Mississippi and Georgia.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The case of Mississippi vs. Johnson.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the Supreme Court of the United States had said, in the case\r\nof Kendall vs. the United States, in 1838, that so far as the\r\nPresident's power is derived from the Constitution he is beyond the\r\nreach of any other department, except in the mode prescribed by the\r\nConstitution, through the impeaching power, and had also indicated, in\r\nthe cases of the Cherokee Nation vs. the State of Georgia, in 1831, and\r\nLuther vs. Borden, in 1849, that it had no jurisdiction over political\r\nquestions, there still prevailed in many minds the idea that the Court\r\nwas the ultimate {145} interpreter of the Constitution in all cases of\r\nwhatever nature, and that no person was exempted from its jurisdiction\r\non account of official station. Under the influence of this idea, W. L.\r\nSharkey, the ex-provisional Governor of Mississippi, appointed by\r\nPresident Johnson in 1865, undertook to obtain from the Supreme Court\r\nof the United States an injunction restraining the President of the\r\nUnited States from carrying the Reconstruction Acts of March, 1867,\r\ninto effect. He was aided in this attempt by the Hon. Robert J. Walker,\r\nand their client in the case, as set up by them, was the \"State of\r\nMississippi.\" In a powerful argument, noted for both clearness and\r\nfrankness, Mr. Johnson's Attorney-General, Mr. Stanbery, demonstrated\r\nthat the President of the United States cannot be made subject to the\r\njurisdiction of any court, while in office, except only the Senate of\r\nthe United States, as the constitutional court of impeachment. The plea\r\nof Mr. Stanbery is also notable for another thing, viz.: the frank way\r\nin which he notified the Southerners that the President's opposition to\r\nthese laws ceased with their successful passage over his vetoes, and\r\nthat the President intended to execute them in spirit and letter, as it\r\nwas his sworn duty to do. The Court decided, in 1866, in the case of\r\nMississippi vs. Johnson, that \"a bill praying an injunction against the\r\nexecution of an act of Congress by the incumbent of the presidential\r\noffice cannot be received, whether it describes him as President or as\r\na citizen of a State.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The case of Georgia vs. Stanton.]\r\n\r\nUnder the delusion that this decision was based entirely upon the\r\nofficial exemption from jurisdiction of the person sought to be made\r\ndefendant, Hon. Charles J. Jenkins, Governor of Georgia, under the\r\nreconstructed constitution of 1865, undertook, as representing the\r\n\"State of Georgia,\" to obtain an injunction against {146} Stanton as\r\nSecretary of War, Grant as General of the army and Pope as commander of\r\nthe third military district, restraining them from putting the\r\nReconstruction Acts of March, 1867, into operation. Mr. Stanbery again\r\ncame forward, in the case of the State of Georgia vs. Stanton, with a\r\nmost able argument against the jurisdiction of the Court over the\r\nquestion involved, it being, as he contended, a political question pure\r\nand simple, and the Court again sustained him, deciding that it\r\npossessed no jurisdiction over the subject-matter presented in the bill\r\nfor relief.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The operations of the commanders.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The registration.]\r\n\r\nThe generals now had free hand to go ahead according, pretty much, to\r\ntheir own discretion. The law gave them, first until September, and\r\nthen until October, to complete the registration, and they themselves\r\nappointed and extended the times of registration at will. They\r\nconstituted the boards of registry chiefly of army officers, Freedmen's\r\nBureau officers, discharged Union soldiers, and negroes. Where white\r\nresidents could be found who could take the iron-clad oath, the oath\r\nprescribed by Congress July 2d, 1862, they were also used in\r\nconstituting these boards. The registration was quite successful in\r\nbringing out most of those qualified to register. The reason for this\r\nwas not ready acquiescence on the part of the whites in the\r\nReconstruction Acts, but it was the calculation that by registering and\r\nnot voting on the question of holding a convention, or on the question\r\nof constitutional ratification, one or both of these propositions might\r\nbe defeated, since the act of March 23d provided, as we have seen, that\r\na majority of the registered voters must vote in order to carry them in\r\nthe affirmative.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The numbers registered.]\r\n\r\nIn Alabama the registration reached the number of 165,813, of whom\r\n104,518 were negroes or colored. In {147} Arkansas it reached the\r\nnumber of 66,831, of whom less than half were known to be colored,\r\nalthough no exact account of the proportion was reported. In Florida it\r\nreached the number of 28,003, of whom 16,089 were colored. In Georgia\r\nit reached the number of 191,501, of whom 95,168 were colored. In\r\nLouisiana it reached the number of 129,654, of whom 84,436 were\r\ncolored. In Mississippi it reached the number of 139,690, of whom, it\r\nwas well known, a large majority were colored, although no exact\r\nfigures giving the proportions were reported. In North Carolina it\r\nreached the number of 179,653, of whom 72,932 were colored. In South\r\nCarolina it reached the number of 127,432, of whom 80,550 were colored.\r\nIn Texas it reached the number of 109,130, of whom 49,497 were colored.\r\nIn Virginia it reached the number of 225,933, of whom 105,832 were\r\ncolored.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The change in the electorate in the South.]\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that of the ten \"States\" to be reconstructed five\r\nwere to be recreated through an electorate in which the majority would\r\nbe negroes and mulattoes, about all of whom had been, three years\r\nbefore, slaves; while in the other five the majority of the\r\nconstructing electorate would be whites by a comparatively small\r\nnumber. This was a tremendous _bouleversement_ of the political society\r\nof these sections. A large majority of the old leaders were\r\ndisfranchised completely and a goodly number of the old Unionists were\r\ndeterred by social considerations from taking any part in the work,\r\nwhile negroes, \"poor white trash,\" \"carpet-baggers\" and a few\r\nself-denying respectables formed the new electorate for recreating\r\n\"State\" governments.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that Congress had the constitutional power to do this\r\nthing, on the theory, of course, that these communities were not\r\n\"States\" of the Union; {148} but it was a reckless thing, and a\r\nmonstrous thing. Anybody of common sense and common honesty could, at\r\nthe time, have foreseen some of the horrible results which were sure to\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The elections.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Efforts of the commanders to get the vote out.]\r\n\r\nSo soon as the registration was completed, the commanders ordered\r\nelections to be held and the vote to be taken, first, upon the question\r\nof convention or no convention, and, at the same time, for the choice\r\nof delegates to the conventions. The commanders did their best to get\r\nout the vote. They met every device for keeping the negroes away from\r\nthe polls and foiled it by means of their arbitrary powers, and they\r\nkept the polls open for two and three days, and in the case of Georgia,\r\nfor five days. There is no doubt that there was repeating, although the\r\nmilitary authorities exerted themselves most sincerely to prevent it.\r\nTheir purpose was not, in any case, to permit fraud, but to give every\r\nopportunity to the freedmen to vote. Their efforts were aided by the\r\nfact that the elections in the Northern \"States\" during the autumn\r\nshowed, in most quarters, large Democratic gains, and by the fact that\r\nin one of the great Northern \"States,\" Ohio, the proposition to\r\nenfranchise negroes by an amendment to the \"State\" constitution was\r\nrejected by a large popular majority. The effect of these facts was to\r\nencourage the whites in the South, who had registered with the\r\nintention of defeating the proposed reconstruction by abstention from\r\nvoting, to vote with the hope of securing a majority of the delegates\r\nto the proposed conventions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The result of the elections.]\r\n\r\nThe result was that in all the communities to be reconstructed as\r\n\"States\" a majority of the registered voters voted on the question of\r\nconvention or no convention, and a large majority of those voting voted\r\nin {149} every case for the holding of the convention. The figures were\r\nas follows: In Alabama, of the 165,813 registered voters, 96,866 voted\r\non the question of convention or no convention, and 90,283 voted for\r\nholding the convention. In Arkansas, of the 66,831 registered voters,\r\n41,134 voted on the question, and 27,576 of these voted in favor of\r\nholding the convention. In Florida, of the 28,003 registered voters,\r\n14,503 voted on the question, and of these 14,300 voted in favor of\r\nholding the convention. In Georgia, of the 191,501 registered voters,\r\n106,410 voted on the question, and of these 102,283 voted in favor of\r\nholding the convention. In Louisiana, of the 129,654 registered voters,\r\n79,089 voted on the question, and of these 75,083 voted in favor of\r\nholding the convention. In Mississippi, of the 139,690 registered\r\nvoters, 76,016 voted on the question, and of these 69,739 voted in\r\nfavor of holding the convention. In North Carolina, of the 179,653\r\nregistered voters, 125,967 voted on the question of convention or no\r\nconvention, and of these 93,006 voted for holding the convention. In\r\nSouth Carolina, of the 127,432 registered voters, 71,046 voted on the\r\nquestion, and of these 68,768 voted for holding the convention. In\r\nTexas, of the 109,130 registered voters, 56,129 voted on the question,\r\nand of these 44,689 voted for holding the convention. And in Virginia,\r\nof the 225,933 registered voters, 169,229 voted on the question, and of\r\nthese 107,342 voted for holding the convention.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The character of the Convention delegates chosen.]\r\n\r\nThe great mass of those who registered and refrained from voting were\r\nthe whites who were opposed to the Congressional Acts for\r\nReconstruction, and hence the persons voting were chiefly the newly\r\nenfranchised. This was likewise true in the voting for the delegates to\r\nthe conventions, with the result that radical men were, for the most\r\npart, {150} chosen. They were new men to the political society of the\r\nSouth. There were a few of the old Whigs among them, who had remained\r\ntrue to the Union in their sentiments during the rebellion, but the\r\nmost of them were \"carpet-baggers,\" that is adventurers or new settlers\r\nfrom the North, \"poor white trash\" and negroes. In the South Carolina\r\nconvention there were 63 negro delegates to 34 white. No such hideous\r\nbodies of men had ever been assembled before upon the soil of the\r\nUnited States for the purpose of participation in the creation of a\r\n\"State\" of the Union, and but for the control exercised over them by\r\nthe military commanders, and the co-operation between the commanders\r\nand the small conservative white element in these bodies, the result of\r\ntheir work would have been the most ghastly travesty of justice,\r\ncommon-sense, and common honesty which the republic had ever been\r\ncalled upon to witness.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The work of the conventions.]\r\n\r\nDuring the winter and spring of 1867-68 the work of these conventions\r\nwent on under the greatest extravagance and incompetence of every kind.\r\nThe constitutions which came from them provided for complete equality\r\nin civil rights and, in some cases, in advantages of a social\r\ncharacter, such as equal privileges in public conveyances, etc. They\r\nalso not only established negro suffrage, as in fact was required by\r\nthe Reconstruction Acts, but they, in most cases, disfranchised those\r\nwhites whom the proposed Fourteenth Amendment would disqualify from\r\nholding office. In Alabama, Arkansas and Louisiana they went even\r\nfurther than this and disfranchised also, in the case of the first two,\r\nall who \"had violated the rules of civilized warfare,\" and in the case\r\nof the last, all who had voted for secession, or had advocated treason\r\nagainst the United States in the press or the pulpit. It is true {151}\r\nthat in most cases ways were provided for removing these disabilities,\r\nbut they were generally connected with such self-stultifying\r\nrequirements as to make them worthless.\r\n\r\nThe restrictions upon eligibility to hold office or mandate were in\r\ngeneral the same as those imposed on the exercise of the suffrage, and\r\nin some cases they went even further, as in the cases of the\r\nMississippi and Virginia instruments, by both of which anybody who had\r\nvoluntarily participated in the rebellion, or had voluntarily given aid\r\nor comfort to those who had, was disqualified.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The vote upon ratification.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fraudulent voting and unlawful voting.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The recall of Pope and the appointment of Meade in his\r\nstead.]\r\n\r\nThe next step in the procedure was the submission of these\r\nconstitutions to the voters. The registration was effected in the same\r\nmanner as for the vote on the question of holding the conventions, and\r\nthe election of the delegates; and the elections were held, as before,\r\nunder the direction and control of the military commanders. The voting\r\nupon the question of ratification came off first in Alabama. General\r\nPope had issued orders that the votes of persons registered in one\r\nprecinct might be received in another, and that \"State\" officers and\r\nlegislative members should be elected at the same election with the\r\nvote on ratification, and by the same voters. There is no doubt that\r\nthe General only desired to secure the freedmen, who were then moving\r\nabout restlessly, in their right of suffrage under the Reconstruction\r\nActs, and to expedite the process of reconstruction so far as possible.\r\nBut he undoubtedly opened the door to fraudulent voting by offering\r\nunrivalled opportunities for repeating, and he also violated the law\r\nand practice under the Constitution of the United States in regard to\r\nthe qualified electors of \"State\" officers and legislators. Such\r\nofficers and legislators could have been constitutionally elected only\r\nby the electors {152} designated in the constitution submitted for\r\nadoption. The qualifications of the electors who vote upon the question\r\nof the adoption of the first \"State\" constitution are necessarily fixed\r\nby Congress, but Congress has no constitutional power to fix the\r\nqualifications of the electors of \"State\" officers and legislators.\r\nNeither has the constitutional convention, which frames the first\r\n\"State\" constitution any such power, for the constitution which it\r\nframes is only a proposition, and ratification by the electors\r\ndesignated by Congress is necessary to its validity. Furthermore, any\r\nresolution which it might pass ordering the election of \"State\"\r\nofficers or legislators by the electors designated by the Congressional\r\nstatute is only a proposition to those electors, which must be accepted\r\nby them by a preliminary vote before they can proceed to the election\r\nof such officers and legislators. The General certainly did not\r\nunderstand these niceties of constitutional law and practice, and his\r\ndesire to hurry up the re-establishment of civil government was rather\r\nlaudable than otherwise. The President, however, who had in his\r\nAttorney-General one of the ablest lawyers of the country, understood\r\nwell the constitutional limitations upon the General's powers and\r\nduties. He recalled the reckless commander and sent the more\r\nconservative Meade to take his place, December 28th, 1867.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rejection of the constitution in Alabama.]\r\n\r\nBefore the election came off, however, a bill was introduced into\r\nCongress, and passed the House of Representatives, and was making its\r\nway, a little more slowly, but surely, through the Senate, which\r\nauthorized the election of \"State\" officers and legislators in the\r\ncommunities suffering reconstruction at the same time that the vote\r\nshould be taken upon the ratification of the new constitutions and by\r\nthe same electors. Congress had not a whit more power to {153} do this\r\nthan the commanders, and the President knew this well enough, but he\r\ngave no instructions to Meade, and so the commander permitted the\r\nvoting for \"State\" officers and legislators at the same election that\r\nthe vote was taken upon the question of the ratification of the\r\nconstitution and by the same electors. But the registered voters\r\nrefrained from voting upon the question of ratification in sufficient\r\nnumbers to reduce the vote to several thousand less than half the\r\nregistration. The proposed constitution was thus rejected under the\r\nprovision of the Reconstruction Acts which required a vote exceeding\r\nthe half of the registration, as well as a majority of that vote, for\r\nratification. The \"State\" government chosen at this same election was\r\nthus in the air.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The statute of Congress changing the proportion of votes to\r\nregistration in the ratification of a constitution.]\r\n\r\nThe Senate now passed the House bill providing that the approval of a\r\nmajority of those voting, no matter what the proportion of the vote to\r\nthe registration might be, should be regarded as a sufficient\r\nratification of the proposed \"State\" constitutions for the communities\r\nsuffering reconstruction; and although this Act was passed more than a\r\nmonth after the vote on the constitution was taken in Alabama, and\r\nalthough, furthermore, General Meade reported that a majority of the\r\nregistered voters had not voted on the question of ratification, and\r\nthat he interpreted this to mean that a majority of the registered\r\nvoters did not want the constitution, yet Congress, as we shall see\r\nlater, applied this new law of March 11th to the Alabama election which\r\nhad taken place in the first days of the preceding February.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Criticism of the statute.]\r\n\r\nIn the original requirement that the vote to be effective must exceed\r\nhalf of the registration, Congress was still upon the ground of correct\r\nprinciple. When it left this ground it virtually accepted the principle\r\nthat republican \"State\" governments may be {154} legitimately created\r\nby a minority of the lawful voters against the will of a majority of\r\nthe lawful voters, and that, too, not by allowing that minority to\r\ndemonstrate its political superiority to the majority by greater\r\nintelligence, or shrewder management, or even by brute force, _but by\r\nthe aid of power coming from without_. Now this is not, in correct\r\npolitical science, \"State\" government in a federal system, autonomous\r\nlocal government, at all. It is provincial government in local affairs,\r\nmore or less complete as the necessity for the outside aid is more or\r\nless continuous. The Republicans had denounced the Johnson \"State\"\r\ngovernments upon the ground, among other grounds, that they were\r\nminority governments, minority governments in the vague and uncertain\r\nsense that not a majority of the adult males had been enfranchised, and\r\nnot in the clear and distinct and unmistakable sense that a minority of\r\nthe enfranchised, supported by the military power of the United States,\r\nmight impose its will upon a majority of the enfranchised. There was\r\nnothing disloyal in the registered voters of Alabama giving Congress to\r\nunderstand that a majority of them preferred the continuance of the\r\nmilitary régime, or the creation of a Territorial government for them\r\nby Congress, to the \"State\" constitution offered them. But it was utter\r\nself-stultification for Congress to take the ground that the Johnson\r\n\"State\" governments were unrepublican because they did not enfranchise\r\nall adult males of whatever race, color, or condition of mind or estate\r\nand overthrow them on that ground, and then proceed to create new\r\n\"State\" governments in their places upon the basis of a minority of the\r\nalready duly qualified and registered voters. No impartial student, at\r\nthis day, can view this terrible inconsistency in any other light than\r\nthat of a high political crime.\r\n\r\n{155} [Sidenote: Ratification in Arkansas.]\r\n\r\nWhile the Senate was proceeding with the bill, another of the Southern\r\ncommunities was rapidly approaching the date fixed for voting upon the\r\nproposed \"State\" constitution, viz., Arkansas. The bill was passed by\r\nCongress the day before the voting began in Arkansas, but it was not\r\nknown in Arkansas that it had been passed until near the close of the\r\nsecond day of the election. It could, however, be claimed that it was\r\napplicable to the case, and it certainly made all figures unnecessary\r\nexcept in regard to the actual voting. The \"State\" officers and\r\nlegislators under the constitution to be adopted were chosen at the\r\nsame time, by the Congressional electorate in Arkansas, and not by the\r\n\"State\" electorate, created by the new constitution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ratification in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia,\r\nFlorida and Louisiana.]\r\n\r\nIn the course of the next two months, April and May, voting upon the\r\nquestion of ratifying the new \"State\" constitutions took place in North\r\nand South Carolina, Georgia, Florida and Louisiana. As the\r\nCongressional Act of March 11th was in full force at this time, the\r\nresult was affirmative in all cases.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Second attempt in Georgia to obstruct Reconstruction.]\r\n\r\nDuring the Reconstruction proceedings in Georgia Governor Jenkins had\r\nrefused to issue an order to the \"State\" Treasurer to pay a sum of\r\nforty thousand dollars, on the ground that the \"State\" legislature\r\n(Johnson government) had not made any such appropriation. For this\r\nrefusal Meade removed him and the \"State\" Treasurer and Controller\r\nGeneral, and appointed military men in their places. These new officers\r\nseized the \"State\" buildings, but Jenkins succeeded in getting away\r\nwith the money in the treasury. He went to Washington and undertook to\r\ninstitute a proceeding in the Supreme Court of the United States\r\nagainst Generals Grant and {156} Meade to restrain the officers\r\nappointed by Meade from levying taxes upon the people of Georgia, and\r\nfrom collecting the same and the other income of the \"State,\" as well\r\nas from exercising other functions. The Court gave its permission to\r\nthe filing of the bill, but put off the hearing of the argument until\r\nthe next term, and before this arrived, the new constitution had been\r\nratified, and new \"State\" officers elected along with the ratification.\r\nIn the other communities mentioned no opposition to the reconstruction\r\nprocess was offered.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rejection of the Constitution in Mississippi.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the opponents of the proposed \"State\" constitution\r\nin Mississippi went into a most earnest and energetic campaign against\r\nits ratification and succeeded, at the election on June 22d, in\r\nrejecting the same by between seven and eight thousand majority. Many\r\nof the better class of negroes voted with their old masters, that is\r\nwith such of these as were allowed by the Congressional acts to\r\nregister and vote, against ratification. Those in favor of ratification\r\nclaimed that fraud was practised by their opponents, in the face of the\r\nfact that they had the elections in their own hands, and they\r\npetitioned the military authorities to put the proposed constitution,\r\nnotwithstanding its rejection at the polls, into operation. This these\r\nauthorities refused to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{157}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE ATTEMPT TO REMOVE THE PRESIDENT\r\n\r\nGrant in the War Office--The President's Message of December 3d,\r\n1867--The President's Special Message Concerning the Suspension of\r\nStanton--The Senate Resolution in Regard to the Suspension of\r\nStanton--Grant's Disobedience toward the President--The Unbearable\r\nSituation in which the President now Found Himself--The Dismissal of\r\nStanton from Office--General Thomas Appointed Secretary of War _ad\r\ninterim_--Stanton's Resistance--Thomas and the President--The Attitude\r\nof the Senate toward the Dismissal of Stanton--The Movements in the\r\nHouse of Representatives--The Arrest of General Thomas--Thomas's Second\r\nAttempt to Take Possession of the War Office--The House Resolution to\r\nImpeach the President--The Withdrawal of Stanton's Complaint against\r\nThomas--The Fear of the Republicans to Test the Tenure-of-Office Act\r\nbefore the Courts--The Managers of Impeachment--The Charges against the\r\nPresident--The President's Answer to the Complaint--The Withdrawal of\r\nMr. Black from the President's Counsel--The Contents of the President's\r\nAnswer--The Replication of the House to the President's Answer--The\r\nTrial--Conduct of the Managers--The Evidence in the Case--The\r\nArgument--The Law in the Case--Mr. Stanton's Violation of Law--The\r\nNomination of General Schofield to be Secretary of War--The Vote upon\r\nImpeachment--The Truth of the Matter--The Abdication of\r\nStanton--Schofield's Confirmation as Secretary of War and His\r\nAcceptance of the Office.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring this same period, another act in the drama of Reconstruction was\r\nbeing played, a fit companion piece to what was occurring in the\r\nunhappy communities of the South. It was the attempt to dispose of the\r\nPresident, and the presidency, by the impeachment of the President.\r\n\r\n{158} [Sidenote: Grant in the War Office.]\r\n\r\nThe history of the President's relations to Mr. Stanton, his Secretary\r\nof War, has already been given down to the suspension of Mr. Stanton in\r\nAugust of 1867, and the designation of General Grant to succeed him _ad\r\ninterim_. Grant immediately assumed the duties of the office, and Mr.\r\nStanton then regarded General Grant as a friend of the President in the\r\ncontroversy between himself and the President.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The President's Message of December 3d, 1867.]\r\n\r\nIn his annual Message to Congress, the Fortieth Congress, of December\r\n3d, 1867, the President said nothing directly in regard to his\r\nsuspension of Mr. Stanton from office. He put forward a strong\r\nargument, couched in moderate and respectful language, against the\r\npolicy and constitutionality of the Reconstruction Acts, as measures\r\nestablishing martial law in times of peace, and as doing it for the\r\npurpose of establishing negro rule over the Southern communities, and\r\nhe urged the repeal of these Acts, and the immediate admission of the\r\nRepresentatives and Senators from these communities, or \"States\" as he\r\nconsidered them, to their seats in Congress. What he said upon these\r\nsubjects is, for the most part, entirely convincing to the impartial\r\nmind, at this day, and all of it was apparently animated with true\r\npatriotism and earnest desire to promote the common weal. At the close\r\nof the argument, however, the President introduced into his Message\r\nsome ambiguous expressions which were unfortunate, to say the least,\r\nand which roused to a high degree the suspicions and the hatred already\r\nentertained against him by the radical Republicans.\r\n\r\nHe wrote as follows: \"How far the duty of the President 'to preserve,\r\nprotect, and defend the Constitution' requires him to go in opposing an\r\nunconstitutional act of Congress is a very serious and important {159}\r\nquestion, on which I have deliberated much and felt extremely anxious\r\nto reach a proper conclusion. Where an act has been passed according to\r\nthe forms of the Constitution by the supreme legislative authority, and\r\nis regularly enrolled among the public statutes of the country,\r\nExecutive resistance to it, especially in times of high party\r\nexcitement, would be likely to produce violent collision between the\r\nrespective adherents of the two branches of the Government. This would\r\nbe simply civil war, and civil war must be resorted to only as the last\r\nremedy for the worst of evils. Whatever might tend to provoke it should\r\nbe most carefully avoided. A faithful and conscientious magistrate will\r\nconcede very much to honest error, and something even to perverse\r\nmalice, before he will endanger the public peace; and he will not adopt\r\nforcible measures, or such as might lead to force, as long as those\r\nwhich are peaceable remain open to him or to his constituents. It is\r\ntrue that cases may occur in which the Executive would be compelled to\r\nstand on its rights, and maintain them regardless of all consequences.\r\nIf Congress should pass an act which is not only in palpable conflict\r\nwith the Constitution, but will certainly, if carried out, produce\r\nimmediate and irreparable injury to the organic structure of the\r\nGovernment, and if there be neither judicial remedy for the wrongs it\r\ninflicts nor power in the people to protect themselves without the\r\nofficial aid of their elected defender--if, for instance, the\r\nlegislative department should pass an act even through all the forms of\r\nlaw to abolish a co-ordinate department of the Government--in such a\r\ncase the President must take the high responsibilities of his office\r\nand save the life of the nation at all hazards. The so-called\r\nReconstruction Acts, though as plainly unconstitutional as any that can\r\nbe imagined, were not believed to be within the class last mentioned.\r\n{160} The people were not wholly disarmed of the power of self-defence.\r\nIn all the Northern 'States' they still held in their hands the sacred\r\nright of the ballot, and it was safe to believe that in due time they\r\nwould come to the rescue of their own institutions. It gives me\r\npleasure to add that the appeal to our common constituents was not\r\ntaken in vain, and that my confidence in their wisdom and virtue seems\r\nnot to have been misplaced.\" These last words referred undoubtedly to\r\nthe recent rejection, by popular vote, in a number of the most\r\nimportant Northern \"States,\" of proposed amendments to \"State\"\r\nconstitutions conferring suffrage upon negroes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The interpretation placed by the Republicans on the\r\nPresident's Message.]\r\n\r\nMost of the Republicans in Congress interpreted this whole paragraph in\r\nthe Message as a threat to violate the Reconstruction Acts, although\r\nthis was disavowed, rather indistinctly it is true, and to violate also\r\nthe Tenure-of-Office Act. It is very difficult to say what the\r\nPresident was aiming at in giving such a warning to a body already\r\nexcited against him to a high degree. It was certainly a _faux pas_ of\r\nthe worst kind, to say the least about it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The President's special Message concerning the suspension of\r\nStanton.]\r\n\r\nJust nine days later the President sent his special Message to the\r\nSenate in regard to his suspension of Mr. Stanton. The gist of it was\r\nthat mutual confidence between himself and Mr. Stanton no longer\r\nexisted, and that when he asked Mr. Stanton to resign Mr. Stanton had\r\ndeclined to do so and had strongly intimated that his reason for\r\ndeclining was his own lack of confidence in the President's patriotism\r\nand integrity. The President claimed that such an attitude, on the part\r\nof a subordinate toward his superior, was unendurable, was in fact\r\nofficial misconduct of a grave order, and he also referred to Stanton's\r\nwithholding Baird's telegram from {161} him just before the New Orleans\r\nriot. The President furthermore discussed Mr. Stanton's letter in reply\r\nto his order to him suspending him from office and commanding him to\r\nturn over the records and property of the office to General Grant. This\r\nletter contained a declaration by Mr. Stanton denying the right of the\r\nPresident, under the Constitution and laws, to suspend him from office,\r\nwithout the advice and consent of the Senate, and without legal cause,\r\nand affirming that he yielded, under protest, to the superior force\r\nwielded by the General of the Army who had been designated to succeed\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThis contention of Mr. Stanton that the President could not suspend him\r\nunder the Constitution and laws of the United States gave the President\r\nthe opportunity of saying that Mr. Stanton must be claiming the\r\nprotection of the Tenure-of-Office Act of March 2d, 1867, and of\r\nrevealing to the Senate Mr. Stanton's most decided condemnation of that\r\nAct when it was a bill before the President. The President asserted\r\nthat Mr. Stanton, as every other member of his Cabinet, advised him\r\nthat the bill was unconstitutional, in that it was a dangerous\r\nencroachment upon the President's constitutional prerogatives, and\r\nurged him to veto it. He also said that all the members of his Cabinet\r\nwho had been appointed by Mr. Lincoln--and Stanton was one of\r\nthese--appeared to be of the opinion that their tenures were not fixed\r\nor affected by the provisions of the bill. The conclusion arrived at by\r\nthe President evidently was that the Tenure-of-Office Act did not cover\r\nMr. Stanton's case, but left it under the law and practice existing\r\nbefore the passage of that measure, and that if it did cover it, the\r\nAct was unconstitutional, and was so considered by Mr. Stanton himself,\r\nand every other member of the Cabinet.\r\n\r\n{162} It is hardly credible that the President intended to recognize\r\nthe validity of the Act by sending this Message to the Senate. It is\r\ntrue that the second section of the Act provided that the President\r\nmight suspend an officer during a recess of the Senate, and designate\r\nan _ad interim_ successor, and must, within the first twenty days of\r\nthe next meeting of the Senate, report the suspension to the Senate,\r\nand it does appear, from a casual view, that the President was acting\r\nunder the authority of this provision, or rather under the duty imposed\r\nby it, in suspending instead of removing Mr. Stanton and in making this\r\nreport of Mr. Stanton's suspension to the Senate. But the President\r\ncould claim that he was proceeding under his general constitutional\r\npower and duty of suspending from office, as a power included in the\r\npower of removal, and of sending such communications as he saw fit to\r\nCongress or to either House thereof. And the fact that he disputed the\r\nconstitutionality of the Act in the Message itself is good internal\r\nevidence that he did not consider that he was in any way acting under\r\nthe authority granted to him by it, or in any way estopping himself, so\r\nto speak, from making future declarations against the constitutionality\r\nof the Act, or even from disobeying its requirements.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Senate resolution in regard to the suspension of\r\nStanton.]\r\n\r\nThe Senate, however, conceived at once that the President was acting\r\nunder the Tenure-of-Office Act, and after considerable discussion,\r\npassed a resolution, on the 13th day of January, 1868, which provided\r\nthat, \"having considered the evidence and reasons given by the\r\nPresident in his report of December 12th, 1867, for the suspension of\r\nEdwin M. Stanton from the office of Secretary of War, the Senate does\r\nnot concur in such suspension.\" The body then instructed its secretary\r\nto send copies of this resolution to the President, General {163} Grant\r\nand Mr. Stanton. It is also evident that General Grant supposed the\r\nPresident was acting under the Tenure-of-Office Act both in suspending\r\nStanton, in appointing himself _ad interim_, and in making report of\r\nthese proceedings to the Senate; for upon receiving his copy of the\r\nSenate's resolution from the secretary of the Senate, he immediately\r\nleft the room of the Secretary of War, locking the door after him and\r\ngiving the key to the Adjutant-General, and repaired to the official\r\nhead-quarters of the General of the army. Stanton manifestly regarded\r\nthe matter in the same way, for upon receiving his copy of the notice\r\nof the Senate's action, he went to the room of the Secretary of War,\r\nand resumed the duties of Secretary of War without further ceremony. He\r\ndid not even go to see Grant, but sent word over to the head-quarters\r\nof the General of the army summoning Grant to wait upon him in the\r\nSecretary's room.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Criticism of the Senate resolution.]\r\n\r\nThere is no question now in any calm and impartial mind that the Senate\r\nacted most inconsiderately, not to say wrongfully, in passing that\r\nresolution. The situation was a perfectly plain one. The President and\r\nStanton could not work together, since they had lost all confidence in\r\neach other. Common-sense and common decency required in such a case the\r\nretirement of the subordinate. The Senate itself had committed itself\r\nto this view in the discussion and votes upon the Tenure-of-Office\r\nbill, in its original form and in its final form. General Grant, the\r\nman who stood first in the confidence of the whole people, was in\r\npossession of the War Office. He had held it already nearly six months,\r\nand had in that short time improved the administration of it very\r\ngreatly. At the end of the six months, at farthest, the President was\r\nheld by the law of 1795, a law whose constitutionality {164} he did not\r\ndispute, to make a nomination to the Senate of a permanent incumbent.\r\nThe Senate would then be able to prevent the appointment of any person\r\nto the office who did not have the confidence of the Senate and the\r\ncountry. No possible harm could thus have come to the country from\r\nacquiescing in Stanton's suspension, and it is hard to see that\r\nanything but harm did come to it in not doing so. No perfectly fair and\r\nunprejudiced mind could have failed to see that then; but the radical\r\nRepublicans--and most of the Republicans in Congress at that moment\r\nwere radical, or at least intensely partisan--were bent upon attacking\r\nand destroying the President in any way they could. They were ready to\r\nlay traps for him, and then to so excite him by encroachments upon the\r\nprerogatives and the dignity of his office as to make him fall into\r\nthem. They were determined to sustain Stanton against the President,\r\nthe subordinate against his lawful superior, simply because they\r\ndespised the President. They claimed that the welfare of the country\r\ndemanded it, and most of them probably thought so, but everybody can\r\nsee the fallacy of that now, and anybody fit to be a Senator of the\r\nUnited States ought to have been able to see it then.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Criticism of General Grant's act.]\r\n\r\nIt is also a question whether General Grant did not act hastily, and\r\ninconsiderately, not to say wrongfully, in yielding the post without\r\ndispute to Mr. Stanton. The President certainly understood General\r\nGrant to promise him to hold on to the office in case the Senate should\r\nnot approve of Stanton's suspension, and thereby compel Stanton to have\r\nrecourse to the courts to regain possession, and thus secure a judicial\r\ndetermination of the constitutionality of the Tenure-of-Office Act, or\r\nto give the office back to the President before the Senate reached its\r\n{165} determination, so that he might have opportunity to put it into\r\nthe hands of a man who would be willing to incur this responsibility;\r\nand the President was able to back this understanding by the testimony\r\nof five members of his Cabinet. On the other hand, General Grant was\r\njust as sincere in his view that his remarks to the President on the\r\nsubject did not amount to a promise, and if they did, he had fulfilled\r\nit when on the 11th of January, two days before the Senate acted, he\r\nindicated to the President his unwillingness to involve himself in a\r\nlawsuit to test the constitutionality of the Tenure-of-Office Act. It\r\nis true that when he spoke with the President, on the 11th, he did not\r\noffer to resign the office, and that it was understood that he would\r\nsee the President again on the subject, and that he did not see the\r\nPresident, nor attempt to see him, before the Senate acted. But he\r\nexplained this apparent failure to keep faith by saying that he was\r\nextremely busy during the two days between the 11th and the 13th, and\r\nthat the Senate had acted much more hastily than he expected it would.\r\n\r\nThere is little doubt that General Grant thought the Senate would\r\nacquiesce in Stanton's suspension, and was taken by surprise when it\r\ndid not do so, and that until the action of the Senate on the 13th, he\r\nhad never seriously considered that any opportunity or necessity for a\r\njudicial proceeding would arise. When, then, the alternative was\r\nsuddenly presented to him of obeying the Tenure-of-Office Act, or\r\ndisputing its constitutionality by forcibly holding possession of the\r\nWar Office, he decided that it would be wrong for the General of the\r\narmy to assume the attitude of defiance to Congress, whatever a\r\ncivilian might consider his duty to be. He thought that such an act on\r\nhis part would look like a contest between the civil and military\r\npowers of the Government, and he was unwilling to provoke it.\r\n\r\n{166} [Sidenote: The President's blunder in his attitude toward Grant.]\r\n\r\nThe President blundered very seriously when he did not accept the\r\nexplanation from General Grant and drop the matter. The General was\r\nfriendly in his feelings toward the President, and when Stanton\r\nrepossessed himself of the War Office in his cavalier way, without\r\nseeking any understanding with Grant, and sent the General a rude\r\nsummons to wait upon him, the General was very naturally and properly\r\nindignant with Stanton. The way was here open for the President to make\r\na close friend of General Grant, by simply appreciating Grant's point\r\nof view in surrendering the War Office, and saying nothing more about\r\nit. But the President was not a prudent man when crossed in his\r\npurposes. He generally thought that the motives of all men who differed\r\nwith him were bad. He showed in this trait his common origin and his\r\nvulgar breeding. He thought that Grant had deceived him and made a\r\nscapegoat of him, and he resolved to have it out with him. He did not\r\nseem to understand at all that in an issue of veracity between General\r\nGrant and himself, the country would believe Grant, no matter who told\r\nthe truth, and who the lie. The utter impossibility of coming out\r\nwinner in a contest with a national hero, no matter what the merits of\r\nthe case might be, does not seem to have occurred to him at all. And so\r\nhe plunged into that unfortunate controversy with General Grant in the\r\npublic prints, which made Grant his enemy for life, at a time when he\r\nneeded most his friendship, and might have had it by the exercise of a\r\nlittle common prudence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The result of the controversy between the President and\r\nGeneral Grant.]\r\n\r\nThe outcome of this whole course of crimination and recrimination was\r\nthat the country came to the belief that the President first tried to\r\nforce the responsibility of a violation of the Tenure-of-Office Act\r\nupon the popular General of the army, and then, when the {167} General\r\nfoiled him in his purpose, undertook to impugn his honor and his\r\nintegrity, and destroy his character before the public. An impartial\r\nstudy of the facts and the correspondence will not sustain any such\r\nview now, but in the state of feeling then prevailing, no such\r\nimpartial study was possible. The President ought to have known this,\r\nand to have controlled his indignation until a more propitious time.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Grant's disobedience toward the President.]\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant's letter closing the controversy is dated February 11th.\r\nIn the interval between his quitting the War Office and this latter\r\ndate, the President instructed the General not to obey any orders from\r\nStanton until he knew they came from the President. This instruction\r\nwas given, first, verbally on January 19th. Grant demanded, on January\r\n24th, a written order from the President on the subject, and repeated\r\nthis request on the 28th. The President replied on the 29th that\r\n\"General Grant is instructed, in writing, not to obey any order from\r\nthe War Department, assumed to be issued by the direction of the\r\nPresident, unless such order is known by the General commanding the\r\narmies of the United States to have been authorized by the Executive.\"\r\nGrant responded, on January 30th, that he had been informed by the\r\nSecretary of War that he (the Secretary) had not received from the\r\nExecutive any order or instructions limiting or impairing his authority\r\nto issue orders to the army as had theretofore been his practice under\r\nthe law and the customs of the Department, and that while this\r\nauthority to the War Department was not countermanded it would be\r\nsatisfactory evidence to him (the General) that any orders issued from\r\nthe War Department by the formal direction of the President were\r\nauthorized by the Executive. This was coming very nearly up to the\r\n{168} line between obedience and disobedience on the part of the\r\nGeneral of the army toward the constitutional Commander-in-chief of the\r\narmy and navy of the United States. The General must have himself felt\r\nthat he was on rather shaky ground, for in the closing paragraph of his\r\nletter of February 11th he disclaimed any intention of disobeying \"any\r\nlegal order of the President distinctly communicated.\" But this was\r\nstill an ambiguous situation. Who was to determine whether an order of\r\nthe President to the General was legal or not? If the President, then\r\nthere was no need of qualifying the word \"order\" by the word \"legal.\"\r\nThe language used, therefore, indicates that the General considered it\r\nwithin _his_ power to decide this question. But if the subordinate can\r\ndetermine upon the legality of the orders of his superior, and disobey\r\nthem in case he considers them illegal, then farewell to all discipline\r\nin civil or military service. It is very clear from these expressions\r\nof the General that Stanton's successful insubordination was already\r\nexercising its demoralizing influence, and was confusing the minds of\r\nthose high in command in regard to the interpretation of their duties\r\nand responsibilities.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The unbearable situation in which the President now found\r\nhimself.]\r\n\r\nThe situation was utterly unbearable for the President. Here was the\r\nconstitutional Executive of the United States, the Commander-in-chief\r\nof the army and the navy, virtually excluded by one of his own\r\nsubordinates from any relation to the business of one of the most\r\nimportant departments of the Government for which he alone was\r\nresponsible, and his subordinate sustained in this attitude by the\r\nlegislative branch of the Government.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The dismissal of Stanton from office.]\r\n\r\nMatters were now rapidly approaching a crisis which could be avoided\r\nonly by the resignation of the {169} President or by the retreat of the\r\nSenate from its indefensible position. If both stood firm the clash\r\nmust follow, and that too very quickly. On the 21st (February) it came.\r\nThe President addressed an order of that date to Mr. Stanton dismissing\r\nhim from the office of Secretary of War, and another order of the same\r\ndate to General Lorenzo Thomas, Adjutant-General of the army,\r\ncommanding him to take possession of the War Office and administer its\r\naffairs _ad interim_. He, on the same date, informed the Senate of his\r\naction, and transmitted to that body a copy of the orders to Stanton\r\nand Thomas.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General Thomas appointed Secretary of War _ad interim_.]\r\n\r\nUpon receiving the order, General Thomas repaired immediately to the\r\nSecretary's room in the War Office, and handed to Mr. Stanton both of\r\nthe documents, they having been put into his hands by the President's\r\nprivate secretary. Upon reading the one addressed to himself, Mr.\r\nStanton immediately asked General Thomas whether he wished him to\r\nvacate at once or would give him time to remove his private property.\r\nThomas replied, \"act as you please.\" Stanton then read the order\r\naddressed to Thomas designating him Secretary _ad interim_, and asked\r\nThomas for a copy of it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Stanton's resistance.]\r\n\r\nThomas then left the Secretary's room and went into his old room, the\r\nAdjutant-General's room, to have a copy of the order made. He returned\r\nat once with it, and when he handed it to Mr. Stanton, the latter said:\r\n\"I do not know whether I will obey your instructions, or whether I will\r\nresist them.\" General Thomas had certified the correctness of the copy,\r\nand had signed himself Secretary of War _ad interim_. The two then went\r\ninto General Schriver's room just across the hallway, and there Stanton\r\ndeclared outright that Thomas should not issue orders as {170}\r\nSecretary of War, and that if he did he (Stanton) would countermand\r\nthem, and he then and there directed General Schriver and General\r\nTownsend, both of whom were present, to disobey any orders coming from\r\nGeneral Thomas as Secretary of War. Mr. Stanton then caused General\r\nTownsend to prepare a written order to Thomas, signed by Mr. Stanton as\r\nSecretary of War, which was as follows: \"Sir: I am informed that you\r\npresume to issue orders as Secretary of War _ad interim_. Such conduct\r\nand orders are illegal, and you are hereby commanded to abstain from\r\nissuing any orders other than in your capacity as Adjutant-General of\r\nthe army.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Thomas and the President.]\r\n\r\nGeneral Thomas then went over to the White House to see the President\r\nabout the matter. He told the President of his conversation with Mr.\r\nStanton, and repeated to him Stanton's replies verbatim. The President\r\nsimply said to him: \"Very well; go and take charge of the office and\r\nperform the duties.\" Thomas did not, however, return to the Secretary's\r\nroom in the War Office that day, and did not see Mr. Stanton again on\r\nthat day.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The attitude of the Senate toward the dismissal of Stanton.]\r\n\r\nWhile these things were occurring in the executive offices matters were\r\nseething at the other end of the avenue. The Senate was deliberating,\r\nif we may call such a stormy procedure as took place a deliberation,\r\nupon the President's communication. It very quickly passed the\r\nfollowing resolution: \"Whereas, the Senate have received and considered\r\nthe communication of the President stating that he had removed Edwin M.\r\nStanton, Secretary of War, and had designated the Adjutant-General of\r\nthe army to act as Secretary of War _ad interim_: Therefore, Resolved\r\nby the Senate of the United States, That under the Constitution and\r\nlaws of the United States the President has no power to remove {171}\r\nthe Secretary of War and designate any other officer to perform the\r\nduties of that office _ad interim_.\" A copy of this resolution was sent\r\nto the President, another copy to Mr. Stanton, and another to General\r\nThomas.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The movements in the House of Representatives.]\r\n\r\nThe excitement in the other House was still more intense and\r\nirrational. The Senate resolution had hardly passed when the radical\r\nMr. Covode presented a motion to the effect that \"Andrew Johnson,\r\nPresident of the United States, be impeached of high crimes and\r\nmisdemeanors.\" This resolution was referred to the Committee of the\r\nHouse on Reconstruction, which was, as we have seen, composed of\r\nmembers nearly all of whom were radical Republicans.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The arrest of General Thomas.]\r\n\r\nEncouraged and strengthened by these movements in the legislature, and\r\nhearing that Thomas had threatened to force his way into the office,\r\nMr. Stanton resolved to forestall all possible movements of General\r\nThomas for gaining possession of the office of Secretary of War. He\r\nprocured a warrant of arrest for the General, and on the next morning,\r\nthe morning of the 22d, the warrant was served on General Thomas just\r\nafter he had risen from his bed, and before he had taken his morning\r\nmeal. The officers who arrested him, the Marshal of the District, and\r\nhis assistant, and a constable, took the General at once before Judge\r\nCartter, the Chief Justice of the District of Columbia. On the way from\r\nthe General's residence to the court-room, the General asked the\r\nofficers to allow him to see the President, and inform the latter of\r\nhis arrest. The Marshal went with the General to the White House, and\r\nwas present at the interview between the General and the President. It\r\nlasted but a moment. The General told the President that he was under\r\narrest. The President replied that he was {172} satisfied to have the\r\ncase go into the courts, that he wanted it judicially determined. He\r\nthen directed the General to go to the Attorney-General, Mr. Stanbery.\r\nThe Marshal permitted him to call at Mr. Stanbery's apartment in his\r\nhotel, and inform the Attorney-General of his arrest. He then took him\r\nbefore Judge Cartter. Nobody was with the General before the Judge,\r\nexcept the officers who had arrested him. The Judge held him to bail in\r\nthe sum of five thousand dollars to appear on the following Wednesday\r\nmorning, the 26th. After about an hour friends of the General came in\r\nand signed his bail bond, and the General was released, the Judge\r\ninforming him that he was not suspended from any of his official\r\nfunctions. The General then went back to the White House and informed\r\nthe President of his release under bail, and the President again\r\nreplied that he wanted the case in the courts.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Thomas's second attempt to take possession of the War\r\nOffice.]\r\n\r\nFinally, the General went over to the rooms of the Secretary of War.\r\nThere he found some six or eight members of Congress with Mr. Stanton,\r\nevidently awaiting the _dénouement_. He demanded the office. Stanton\r\nordered him to his room as Adjutant-General. He refused to obey. He\r\ndemanded the office of the Secretary of War a second and a third time,\r\nand a second and a third time Stanton refused to yield it to him and\r\nordered him to his room as Adjutant-General. The General then left the\r\nroom of the Secretary of War, and went across the hall into General\r\nSchriver's room. Stanton followed him and asked him if he insisted on\r\nacting as Secretary of War. The General replied that he did, and would\r\ndemand the mails of the War Office. The two then fell into a friendly\r\nchat, General Thomas saying that he had had nothing to eat or drink\r\nthat day and requesting Mr. Stanton the next time he might have him\r\narrested not to do it before {173} breakfast, and Stanton appealing to\r\nSchriver to bring out his whiskey, which Schriver did, and the two men,\r\nThomas and Stanton, drank a little together on Stanton's invitation.\r\nWith this Thomas's attempt to get possession of the War Office seems to\r\nhave ended. On the same day the President sent to the Senate for\r\nconfirmation as Secretary of War the name of Thomas Ewing, Sr. Mr.\r\nEwing was a man of undoubted ability and of the purest loyalty. He had\r\nbeen one of Lincoln's best friends and supporters and was the\r\nfather-in-law of General Sherman; but the Senate denied that the\r\nPresident had any power to send in a nomination, that is, denied that\r\nthere was a vacancy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The House resolution to impeach the President.]\r\n\r\nOn the same day, also, the 22d, the Reconstruction Committee of the\r\nHouse, to whom the resolution for impeaching the President had been\r\nreferred, reported it back with the recommendation that it be passed,\r\nand the chairman, Mr. Thaddeus Stevens, urged that it might pass\r\nwithout debate. But the members began at once to debate it hotly, and\r\ncontinued to do so through the day and deep into the night. The\r\nfollowing day was Sunday, the 23d. The House had, therefore, one day of\r\nrecess in which to cool down. But on Monday the angry determination of\r\nthe Republican leaders was even more manifest than on the preceding\r\nSaturday. All day long the war of words went on. The reproach and the\r\nodium heaped upon the President were simply immeasurable. Read from the\r\npoint of view of to-day, and at this distance from the event, most of\r\nit appears highly extravagant, and some of it ridiculous and even\r\npuerile. Late in the afternoon the vote was reached, by application of\r\nthe previous question rule. The House resolved to impeach the President\r\nbefore the Senate by a vote of 126 to 47. All those voting in the\r\naffirmative were {174} Republicans, and all those voting in the\r\nnegative were Democrats.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The committee of the House on impeachment.]\r\n\r\nBy another strict party vote the House authorized the Speaker to\r\nappoint a committee to acquaint the Senate with its resolution to\r\nimpeach the President before that body, and another committee to draw\r\nup the articles of impeachment. The Speaker, Mr. Colfax, appointed Mr.\r\nStevens and Mr. Bingham to constitute the first committee, and Mr.\r\nBoutwell, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Bingham, Mr. Wilson, Mr. Logan, Mr. Julian\r\nand Mr. Ward to constitute the second. This committee immediately set\r\nabout its work, and on the 29th was ready to report.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The withdrawal of Stanton's complaint against Thomas.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the day for General Thomas to appear in court, February 26th,\r\narrived. By this time the General had taken legal advice, and the plan\r\nof his counsel was to refuse to give further bail, allow him thus to be\r\ncommitted to jail, then sue out a writ of Habeas Corpus from a United\r\nStates judge, and bring in this way the question of the\r\nconstitutionality of the Tenure-of-Office Act to judicial\r\ndetermination. But Judge Cartter foiled this plan, according to the\r\nword of Judge Luke P. Poland of Vermont, who drew the complaint against\r\nThomas, by declining to make any further order requiring bail, and on\r\nthe same day Mr. Stanton withdrew the complaint, and the case was thus\r\nprevented from reaching the United States courts at all.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The fear of the Republicans to test the Tenure-of-Office Act\r\nbefore the courts.]\r\n\r\nThere is little doubt that the Republicans were afraid to have the\r\nTenure-of-Office Act tested judicially. They preferred recourse to the\r\nCourt of Impeachment to settle the matter so far as President Johnson\r\nwas concerned. It is true that Stanton alleged that he brought the case\r\nagainst Thomas in order to test judicially the right of {175} Thomas to\r\nthe office of Secretary of War, and that he withdrew the complaint as\r\nsuperfluous after the House of Representatives had resolved to impeach\r\nthe President, but that may have been a mere legal form of excuse.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The managers of impeachment.]\r\n\r\nThree days after this, as we have seen, the committee charged with\r\npreparing the articles of impeachment reported to the House. They were\r\ndebated until March 3d, when they were adopted by a strict party vote,\r\nand the managers to conduct the prosecution were elected. They were\r\nMessrs. Bingham, Boutwell, Wilson, Butler, Williams, Logan and Stevens.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The charges against the President.]\r\n\r\nDisregarding the legal order and form of the eleven articles of\r\nimpeachment, we may say briefly that the charges against the President\r\nwere:\r\n\r\nFirst, that he violated the Tenure-of-Office Act in issuing an order\r\ndeposing Stanton from the office of Secretary of War, and another order\r\nappointing Thomas to the office of Secretary of War _ad interim_.\r\n\r\nSecond, that he violated the Anti-conspiracy Act of July 31, 1861, in\r\nconspiring with Thomas to expel Stanton by force from the War Office,\r\nand to seize upon the property and papers of the United States in the\r\nWar Office, and to unlawfully disburse the money appropriated for the\r\nmilitary service and the Department of War.\r\n\r\nThird, that he violated the Act of March 2, 1867, which, among other\r\nthings, directed that the military orders and instructions of the\r\nPresident and Secretary of War should be issued through the General of\r\nthe army, by attempting to induce General Emory, the commander of the\r\ntroops around Washington, to disregard this law and take his orders\r\nimmediately from the President.\r\n\r\nAnd fourthly, that he committed high misdemeanors {176} in his speeches\r\ndenouncing the Thirty-ninth Congress, and declaring it to be a Congress\r\nof only a part of the \"States.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The charges presented to the Senate.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The President's appearance entered by his counsel.]\r\n\r\nThese charges were presented by the managers of the impeachment to the\r\nSenate on March 5th, the day upon which the Senate organized itself as\r\na Court of Impeachment, by assembling under the presidency of the Chief\r\nJustice of the United States, who administered the oath to the Senators\r\nas members of the court. The court directed its sergeant-at-arms to\r\nserve its summons upon the President to appear before its bar and\r\nanswer to the charges preferred against him, and then adjourned to the\r\n13th of the month. On the 13th the court reassembled. The chief clerk\r\nread the return of the sergeant-at-arms to the writ of summons, to the\r\neffect that he had served the writ upon the President at seven o'clock\r\nP.M. of Saturday, the 7th day of the month; and the President entered\r\nhis appearance by his counsel, Henry Stanbery, Benjamin R. Curtis,\r\nJeremiah S. Black, William M. Evarts and Thomas A. R. Nelson, and asked\r\nfor forty days for the preparation of his answer to the charges. The\r\nfirst four of these men were the most noted constitutional lawyers of\r\nthe country, and the fifth was one of Mr. Johnson's loyal Tennessee\r\nfriends and his chief ally in the Union cause in Tennessee during the\r\nyears of sorest trial. Mr. Stanbery had resigned the office of\r\nAttorney-General of the United States in order to take the leading part\r\nin the defence of the President.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The President's answer to the complaint.]\r\n\r\nThe managers on the part of the House very ungenerously objected to\r\ngiving the President any time at all for the preparation of his answer\r\nfurther than what he had had since the service of the summons upon him,\r\nbut the Senate {177} resolved to give him ten days, that is until March\r\n23d. Upon the latter day the Senate resumed its sitting as a Court of\r\nImpeachment, and the President's counsel appeared with his answer to\r\nthe charges made against him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The withdrawal of Mr. Black from the President's counsel.]\r\n\r\nAn incident occurred at this point in the history of the procedure,\r\nwhich should be related, although it interrupts somewhat the thread of\r\nthe narrative. It was the disappearance of Mr. Black from among the\r\ncounsel for the President, and the appearance of Mr. Groesbeck in his\r\nplace. It was the gossip among the enemies of the President, and this\r\ngossip was sedulously spread abroad throughout the whole country by\r\nthem, that Black on examining the case had become convinced of the\r\nPresident's guilt and had retired from the case for this reason, and\r\nfor the further reason that he had become disgusted with the\r\nPresident's conduct. It did not become known until later that during\r\nthis time Judge Black was counsel for a firm composed of one Patterson\r\nand one Marguiendo, which firm claimed a guano island in the West\r\nIndies, called Alta Vela, and that one of Judge Black's colleagues in\r\nthe prosecution of the Patterson-Marguiendo claim, one J. W. Shaffer,\r\nprocured a letter of the date of the 9th of March, 1868, that is one\r\nweek after the House of Representatives had resolved to impeach the\r\nPresident, signed by General Benjamin F. Butler and approved by John A.\r\nLogan, J. A. Garfield, W. H. Koontz, J. K. Moorhead, Thaddeus Stevens,\r\nJ. G. Blaine and John A. Bingham, some of them the most bitter among\r\nthe President's enemies, which contained the statement that these\r\ngentlemen were clearly of the opinion that the citizens of the United\r\nStates had the exclusive right to the guano beds of Alta Vela island,\r\nand an expression of their {178} surprise that the President had not\r\nupheld this right by force against the claims of the Dominican\r\nGovernment to the island, and caused this letter to be placed in the\r\nhands of the President on the 16th day of March, and that on the 17th\r\nor 18th of March Judge Black had an interview with the President and\r\nurged him to send an armed vessel of the United States to Alta Vela to\r\ntake possession of the island, and that the President, viewing this\r\napproach to him at this time as an attempt to take advantage of his\r\nsituation, refused, and that on the next day, the 19th of March, Judge\r\nBlack declined to appear further as the President's counsel in the\r\nimpeachment trial.\r\n\r\nIt must have taken a good deal of self-control on the part of the\r\nPresident, in possession of all these facts, to keep them quietly to\r\nhimself for more than a month from the time of Judge Black's retirement\r\nfrom his case, while his enemies were pointing the finger of a supposed\r\ntriumphant scorn at him as being unworthy to have so honest a man as\r\nJudge Black among his counsel, and then to allow them to be given out\r\nonly under provocation from the managers of the impeachment, taunting\r\nhim with his treatment of Judge Black, and with Judge Black's\r\nwithdrawal from his case.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The contents of the President's answer.]\r\n\r\nBut to return to the President's answer to the charges against him.\r\nDisregarding again legal verbiage and order, the President answered\r\nsubstantially that Stanton's case was not affected by the\r\nTenure-of-Office Act, and that he held his office, according to the\r\nConstitution and laws of the United States, and the wording of his\r\ncommission, at the pleasure of the President; that even if Stanton's\r\ncase were covered by the Act, the President was within his right and\r\nwas not thereby committing any crime or misdemeanor at all, to so act\r\nas to make up an issue {179} before the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates, whereby the constitutionality of the Act might be tested; that\r\nthe authority given to General Thomas to act as Secretary of War _ad\r\ninterim_ was not an appointment nor an attempt to make an appointment,\r\nbut was only a designation of a person to act temporarily until an\r\nappointment could be made by and with the consent of the Senate, a\r\nthing which the President was empowered to do by the Act of February\r\n13th, 1795, still in force; that he had not entered into any conspiracy\r\nwith Thomas or anybody else to force Stanton out of the War Office, or\r\nto seize the property and papers of the United States in the War\r\nOffice, that he could not in fact do so, since Stanton was not lawfully\r\nin the War Office, and since the President of the United States was the\r\nultimate lawful custodian of the property and papers of the United\r\nStates in the War Office, but that his communications with Thomas were\r\norders from the President to a subordinate officer, to whom the\r\nPresident gave no authority to use force for their execution, and who\r\ndid not use any force in his attempts to execute them, the intention of\r\nthe President only being, if his authority should be resisted by Mr.\r\nStanton, to create an issue before the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates, and secure thereby a judicial determination of the rights and\r\npowers of the parties concerned, and not to do anything unlawful; that\r\nhe had never undertaken to induce General Emory to take his orders\r\nimmediately from himself in violation of the Act of March 2d, 1867,\r\nwhich provided that all of the military orders and instructions issuing\r\nfrom the President and the Secretary of War should pass through the\r\nhands of the General of the Army, but that he had only expressed to\r\nGeneral Emory, as he had to Congress, his conviction that the Act was\r\nin violation of the Constitution, which latter {180} conferred upon the\r\nPresident the Commandership-in-chief of the army and the navy; and\r\nfinally, that his speeches were simply the expression of his opinions\r\nas a free citizen of the Republic, which right was guaranteed to him\r\nand to every other citizen by the Constitution of the country, and\r\ncould not be made out in any way to have any of the qualities of a\r\ncrime or a misdemeanor, and that his declaration that the Thirty-ninth\r\nCongress was a Congress of only a part of the \"States\" was intended by\r\nhim in no other sense than that of an assertion that ten \"States\" of\r\nthe Union were not represented in it, all of which ought to be so\r\nrepresented when they should send loyal men to take seats therein, and\r\nthat he had never intended by this declaration to deny the validity of\r\nthe acts of the Congress or its power to originate and adopt an\r\namendment to the Constitution of the United States.\r\n\r\nAfter the filing of this answer, the counsel of the President asked the\r\nCourt of Impeachment for thirty days' time after the replication of the\r\nHouse of Representatives to this answer should be filed for the\r\npreparation of the President's case. But the managers on the part of\r\nthe House again very ungenerously opposed giving them any time at all\r\nfor this purpose. The debate over this point lasted until after the\r\nreplication of the House was filed on the following day, that is on the\r\n24th of March. The Court of Impeachment then decided to give them until\r\nMarch 30th, and ordered the trial to proceed on that day.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The replication of the House to the President's answer.]\r\n\r\nThe replication filed by the House of Representatives, on the 26th, was\r\nan exception to the answer of the President as insufficient, a denial\r\nof all the averments of the answer, a declaration of the guilt of the\r\nPresident of the high crimes and misdemeanors charged, and an offer to\r\nprove the same.\r\n\r\n{181} [Sidenote: The trial.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Conduct of the managers.]\r\n\r\nOn the 30th, the trial opened with the fierce, not to say brutal,\r\nattack of Mr. Butler on the President. During the entire course of the\r\ntrial, from the 30th of March until the 16th of May, the managers\r\nfollowed a line of conduct which no impartial student of this day can\r\nfail to condemn, and which, even in that time of hostile passion\r\nagainst the President, lost to them a large measure of popular favor.\r\nThey tried to prevail upon the Court of Impeachment to regard itself as\r\na political body instead of a court, to renounce all limitations upon\r\nits powers, and to accept common rumors against the President as good\r\nevidence of his guilt. On the other hand, they objected to the\r\nintroduction of evidence by the President to prove the purpose of his\r\nacts, and to show the advice upon which he had proceeded in their\r\ncommission. They succeeded in inducing the Court of Impeachment to\r\nrefuse to hear the President's evidence upon these points, although the\r\nChief Justice had ruled in favor of its reception. There is no doubt\r\nthat their cause was greatly weakened in the public esteem by this\r\nmanifestation of partisanship on the part of the court.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The evidence in the case.]\r\n\r\nThe evidence in the case showed no conspiracy with Thomas to do\r\nanything, and no orders to him to use any force in what he was\r\nauthorized to do, and no attempt to induce General Emory to violate any\r\nlaw or any orders received from or through the General of the Army or\r\nany other legal authority. The case, thus, rested chiefly upon the\r\nquestion as to whether the President had violated the Tenure-of-Office\r\nAct; and the transactions of the President in regard to this subject\r\nwere matters of record.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The argument.]\r\n\r\nWhen one, at this lapse of time from the events, peruses the calm,\r\ndignified, convincing and masterful arguments of the President's\r\ncounsel, and compares {182} them with the passionate, partisan\r\nharangues of the managers, it is very difficult to understand how the\r\nlatter could have made any serious impression at all. There was only a\r\nsingle point upon the law seemingly involved in the case in regard to\r\nwhich they held the better reason. That was the claim on their part\r\nthat the President had no right to violate an act of Congress for the\r\npurpose of testing its validity before the United States courts, or for\r\nany other purpose. They argued with much force that to allow the\r\nPresident the power to violate an act of Congress, or to omit to\r\nexecute an act of Congress, in order to make up an issue before the\r\ncourts upon the question of its constitutionality, would be virtually\r\nto attribute to the President the once hated royal power of suspending\r\nthe law at the pleasure of the Executive. They contended that the veto\r\npower was placed in the hands of the President for the purpose of\r\nallowing him to be heard at the proper time, and to act at the proper\r\ntime, in regard to the passage of any law, and that no other power was\r\ngiven him in relation to the subject; that after he had exhausted this\r\npower, he was bound to execute the legislation of Congress, and could\r\nnot suspend it or violate it for any purpose whatsoever; and that the\r\nconstitutionality of any of the acts of Congress could be raised before\r\nthe courts only by persons not charged with the execution of the law\r\nand having such interests affected by the act in question as would\r\nwarrant a judicial procedure.\r\n\r\nJudge Curtis was so influenced by the consideration that to claim such\r\na power for the President would give him a double veto upon all of the\r\nacts of Congress, a veto when acting as a part of the legislature in\r\nthe enactment of law, and then a purely executive veto which could be\r\novercome only by an adverse judicial decision, that he expressed his\r\ncontention on the subject in very {183} cautious language. He declared\r\nthat the President claimed no such general power as that, but he said\r\n\"when a question arises whether a particular law has cut off a power\r\nconfided to him by the people through the Constitution, and he alone\r\ncan raise that question, and he alone can cause a judicial decision to\r\ncome between the two branches of the Government to say which of them is\r\nright, and after due deliberation, with the advice of those who are his\r\nproper advisers, he settles down firmly upon the opinion that such is\r\nthe character of the law, it remains to be decided by you, Senators,\r\nwhether there is any violation of his duty when he takes the needful\r\nsteps to raise that question and have it peacefully decided.\"\r\n\r\nThe great lawyer refused thus to commit himself upon this fundamental\r\nquestion of constitutional law. And well he might, for to recognize any\r\nsuch power in the President would be to enable him to rule with such\r\narbitrariness as to upset the principles and practices of all free\r\ngovernment. The President can constitutionally defend his prerogatives\r\nwith the veto power, a power which nothing short of a two-thirds\r\nmajority of both Houses of Congress can overcome, and he has no other\r\npower of defence confided to him by the Constitution. He must execute\r\nthe laws passed over his veto upon matters which in his opinion touch\r\nhis executive prerogatives, just the same as upon all other matters,\r\nand if persons not connected with the administration of the laws do not\r\ncall such measures in question before the courts, the remedies provided\r\nby the Constitution for the people of the United States are either the\r\nelection of members of Congress who will repeal the enactments, or else\r\nthe amendment of the Constitution so as to repeal them. It was,\r\nhowever, a question whether, in showing the sole purpose of making an\r\nissue before the courts, the {184} President would not clear himself of\r\nany criminal intent. Happily his case did not require this, as was\r\ndemonstrated by his counsel and by Senators Trumbull and Fessenden in\r\ntheir opinions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The law in the case.]\r\n\r\nThe law governing the President's case was perfectly clear to anyone\r\nwho could divest himself of political prejudice and of personal\r\nhostility. It was briefly this. By an Act of the First Congress, of the\r\ndate of August 7th, 1789, Congress interpreted the Constitution as\r\ngiving the President the power to remove any officer of the United\r\nStates, except judges of the United States courts, at his discretion,\r\nas an incident of his sole executive responsibility, and in an especial\r\nsense recognized this constitutional power as belonging to the\r\nPresident in the case of the heads of the governmental departments, the\r\nmembers of the Cabinet, as they afterwards came to be called, since\r\nthese persons stood, and must stand, in a peculiarly confidential\r\nrelation to the President, as his official advisers. This\r\ninterpretation of the Constitution as to the President's power of\r\nremoval and the practice built upon it remained untouched by the\r\nCongress until the 2d of March, 1867, when, as we have seen, Congress\r\nenacted, \"that every person holding any civil office to which he has\r\nbeen appointed by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, and\r\nevery person who shall be hereafter appointed to any such office, and\r\nshall become duly qualified to act therein, is and shall be entitled to\r\nhold such office until a successor shall have been in like manner\r\nappointed and duly qualified, except as herein otherwise provided:\r\nProvided, That the Secretaries of State, of the Treasury, of War, of\r\nthe Navy, and of the Interior, the Postmaster-General, and the\r\nAttorney-General, shall hold their offices respectively for and during\r\nthe term of the President by whom they may have been {185} appointed,\r\nand one month thereafter, subject to removal by and with the advice and\r\nconsent of the Senate.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that in the Tenure-of-Office bill as it\r\noriginated in the Senate the members of the Cabinet were entirely\r\nexcepted from its operation; that the House in passing the bill\r\nincluded them; that the Senate would not agree to their inclusion; that\r\nthe bill was then sent to a conference committee; that this committee\r\ninvented the compromise contained in the proviso; that this proviso was\r\nunderstood to give to each President the power to choose his own\r\nCabinet officers once during his term, and therefore to remove any\r\nCabinet officer not originally appointed by him, but holding under a\r\ncommission from a former President, and remaining in office only by the\r\nsufferance of the existing President; that this was especially the true\r\nmeaning of the proviso in regard to those Cabinet officers then in\r\noffice, but who had been appointed and commissioned by Mr. Lincoln\r\nduring his first term to hold during the pleasure of the President; and\r\nthat it was upon this explanation of the meaning of the proviso that\r\nthe Senate voted the resolution of the conference committee.\r\n\r\nFrom all this it is entirely clear that the President had the legal\r\npower to remove Mr. Stanton, no matter whether the Tenure-of-Office Act\r\nwas constitutional or not, simply because his case was excepted by the\r\nproviso in the first article in the Act from the operation of the Act,\r\nand was left to the operation of the laws in existence at the time the\r\nAct was passed. There is little question now that that Act was not in\r\naccordance with a fair interpretation of the Constitution, but it was\r\nnot at all necessary to hold that view in order to clear the President\r\nof the accusation of having violated the Constitution and the laws of\r\nthe land.\r\n\r\n{186} The law in reference to the _ad interim_ appointment, or\r\ndesignation, of General Thomas was equally plain to the impartial eye.\r\nThe Constitution provides only for vacancies that may happen during the\r\nrecess of the Senate, and empowers the President to fill all such by\r\ngranting commissions which shall expire at the end of its next session.\r\nBy an act of May 8th, 1792, Congress empowered the President, in case\r\nof the death, sickness, or absence from the seat of government, of the\r\nSecretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, or the Secretary of\r\nWar, whether these events should occur during a session, or a recess,\r\nof the Senate, \"to authorize any person or persons, at his discretion,\r\nto perform the duties of the said respective offices until a successor\r\nbe appointed, or until such absence or inability by sickness should\r\ncease.\"\r\n\r\nAnother act of Congress of February 13th, 1795, empowered the\r\nPresident, in case of vacancy from any cause in the offices of\r\nSecretary of State, Secretary of the Treasury, or Secretary of War,\r\nhappening either during a recess or a session of the Senate, \"to\r\nauthorize any person or persons, at his discretion, to perform the\r\nduties of the said respective offices until a successor be appointed or\r\nsuch vacancy be filled,\" provided, however, that no one vacancy should\r\nbe supplied in that manner for a longer time than six months.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that neither of these statutes provided for the\r\ntemporary filling of vacancies in any of the Departments, except those\r\nof State, the Treasury, and War. In practice, however, the Presidents\r\nhave followed the analogies of the law of 1795, when it became\r\nnecessary, in their opinion, to make a temporary designation in the\r\nother Departments. On the 22d of September, 1862, President Lincoln\r\nappointed J. B. L. Skinner Postmaster-General _ad interim_. It was Mr.\r\nLincoln himself {187} who called the attention of Congress to the fact\r\nthat he had no literal legal authority for this, and who on January 2d,\r\n1863, asked Congress to extend the Act of May 8th, 1792, so as to cover\r\nthe cases of the other Departments, and empower the President to make\r\n_ad interim_ appointments to fill vacancies in these Departments\r\nhappening on account of death, sickness, or absence from the seat of\r\ngovernment. Why the President did not ask for the extension of the Act\r\nof February 13th, 1795, which covered all vacancies happening from\r\nwhatever cause, instead of the Act of 1792, which covered those only\r\nwhich might happen from death, sickness, or absence from the seat of\r\ngovernment, we do not know. We only know that in January, 1863, both\r\nthe President and Congress were greatly pressed by the exigencies of\r\nthe war, and did things generally in haste and without much\r\nconsideration. In answer to the President's suggestion, Congress passed\r\nthe Act of February 20th, 1863, extending the Act of 1792 so as to\r\ncover all the executive Departments in the cases of vacancy provided\r\nfor in that Act, viz., by cause of death, sickness, or absence from the\r\nseat of Government--adding resignation--and limiting the President,\r\nhowever, in these appointments to persons already officers in one or\r\nthe other of the Departments, and providing that no one vacancy should\r\nbe so supplied for a longer period than six months. The vacancies which\r\nmight happen from expiration of term or by removal were not at all\r\nprovided for by the Act of 1863; and as the Act of 1863 did not\r\nexpressly repeal the Act of 1795, but only declared that \"all acts and\r\nparts of acts inconsistent with this act are hereby repealed,\" the Act\r\nof 1795 remained in force as to all vacancies caused by expiration of\r\nterm or by removal, whether happening during a recess or a session of\r\nthe Senate.\r\n\r\n{188} Neither did the Tenure-of-Office Act of 1867 repeal the Act of\r\n1795 in regard to first vacancies happening among the Secretaries of\r\nDepartments by other causes than those provided for in the Act of 1863,\r\neither expressly or by implication, since these first vacancies were\r\nexpressly excepted from the operation of the Act of 1867, by the\r\nproviso attached to the first article. And even if it should be held\r\nthat the Act of 1867 did repeal that of 1795 entirely, yet, in that it\r\ndid not forbid the President to make _ad interim_ appointments in the\r\ncases where a Secretary's term expired, or a Secretary was lawfully\r\nremoved by him, the President's designation of Thomas could not be\r\nconsidered as a violation of law but only as an act without warrant of\r\nlaw, the very kind of an act committed by Mr. Lincoln in his\r\nappointment of Skinner as Postmaster-General _ad interim_ in 1862, and\r\ncommitted by other Presidents in other cases.\r\n\r\nThe managers made much of the argument that the President had\r\nrecognized the validity of the Tenure-of-Office Act in suspending\r\nStanton the preceding August, and reporting his suspension to the\r\nSenate, and in notifying the Secretary of the Treasury of the\r\nsuspension, as provided in the Act, and asserted that he was therefore\r\nestopped from denying its constitutionality. But while it can be easily\r\nshown that these acts of the President did not at all militate against\r\nhis claim that other parts of the statute were unconstitutional, still\r\nthis was not at all necessary to the President's defence, under the\r\nview here advanced of the relations between the Acts of 1867, 1863, and\r\n1795. It made no difference, under this view, whether the Act of 1867\r\nwas, or was not, constitutional and valid. In either case the President\r\nhad violated no law, either constitutional or statutory.\r\n\r\n{189} [Sidenote: Mr. Stanton's violation of law.]\r\n\r\nThe fact is that Mr. Stanton and those who abetted him were the\r\nviolators of law. Every official act which he committed after receiving\r\nthe notification from the President of his removal, on the 21st of\r\nFebruary, was a usurpation of governmental powers by a private citizen,\r\nand the gathering of armed men about him with the purpose of sustaining\r\nhim in holding on to the War Office after his dismissal by the\r\nPresident was treason. It is a question whether his official acts after\r\nthe 13th of January and down to February 21st were not also\r\nusurpations. That depends upon whether the Tenure-of-Office Act was, or\r\nwas not, constitutional, and whether, if it were, the right of a member\r\nof the Cabinet, suspended from office, to resume the functions of the\r\noffice, after disapproval of the suspension by the Senate, was made, by\r\nthe Act, to apply to such members of the Cabinet as were excepted from\r\nthe operation of the first article of the Act by the proviso to that\r\narticle. The best Republican lawyers in the Senate, Trumbull,\r\nFessenden, Grimes and Doolittle, took the view of the law in the\r\nPresident's case as here explained. They, with one other Republican,\r\nVan Winkle of West Virginia, filed, after the vote on impeachment,\r\nopinions in the case expressing substantially this view.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The nomination of General Schofield to be Secretary of War.]\r\n\r\nIt is now known that during the trial some of these men expressed to\r\none of the President's counsel the belief that Mr. Johnson could not be\r\nconvicted upon the law and evidence in the case, and that should the\r\nSenate vote to remove him, \"it would be done wholly from supposed party\r\nnecessity,\" and from fear of what the President might do in case he\r\nwere acquitted, and that they suggested to this member of the\r\nPresident's counsel the wisdom of the President's sending to the\r\nSenate, at that {190} juncture, a nomination for the Secretaryship of\r\nWar, which would allay all reasonable apprehension that the President\r\nwould, if acquitted, use the War Department for the accomplishment of\r\nany arbitrary purposes, and that they mentioned General Schofield as a\r\nman who would be satisfactory. These communications were made about the\r\n20th of April. The President was immediately informed of them, as was\r\nGeneral Schofield, and, on April 24th, the President nominated General\r\nSchofield to the Senate to be Secretary of War. Whether this move on\r\nthe part of the President influenced any Senator to vote for acquittal\r\nis unknown. It certainly served to allay popular apprehension, if the\r\ntestimony of the newspapers of the day may be taken on that point.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The vote upon impeachment.]\r\n\r\nFifty-four Senators from the twenty-seven \"States\" represented\r\nconstituted the membership of the Court of Impeachment under the\r\npresidency of the Chief Justice. The President must, therefore, have\r\nnineteen votes in order to escape conviction. Of these fifty-four, only\r\neight were Democrats. It was practically certain that all of these\r\nwould vote for acquittal. He needed, therefore, at least eleven\r\nRepublican votes in his favor. The closing of the case by the\r\nprosecution occurred on the 6th of May, and, on the 7th, the court\r\npassed the resolution to take the vote of its members upon the articles\r\nof impeachment on the 12th. On that day Mr. Chandler of Michigan\r\ninformed the court that his colleague, Mr. Howard, was too ill to\r\nappear, and asked the court to adjourn to the 16th, in order to give\r\nMr. Howard the opportunity to be present. The court agreed to this\r\nrequest. On the 16th, with all the members present, the voting began.\r\nThe last article, the eleventh, was, by an order of the court, taken\r\nfirst, and the Chief Justice {191} put the question to each Senator:\r\n\"Mr. Senator--how say you? Is the respondent Andrew Johnson, President\r\nof the United States, guilty or not guilty of a high misdemeanor, as\r\ncharged in this article?\" Thirty-five votes were cast in the\r\naffirmative, and nineteen in the negative. So soon as it was known that\r\nthe President had been acquitted upon this article, a motion was made\r\nby Mr. Williams of Oregon to adjourn the court to the 26th. After the\r\nannouncement of the vote by the Chief Justice, this motion was carried\r\nand the court adjourned to the 26th. On that day it reassembled and\r\nproceeded to vote upon the second article and then on the third, with\r\nthe same result as upon the eleventh. Whereupon Mr. Williams moved that\r\nthe Senate sitting as a Court of Impeachment adjourn _sine die_, and\r\nthe motion was carried by a vote of 34 to 16, 4 not voting. The\r\nRepublicans who voted \"not guilty\" were Messrs. Dixon of Connecticut,\r\nDoolittle of Wisconsin, Fessenden of Maine, Fowler of Tennessee, Grimes\r\nof Iowa, Henderson of Missouri, Norton of Minnesota, Patterson of\r\nTennessee, Ross of Kansas, Trumbull of Illinois, and Van Winkle of West\r\nVirginia. The country and the Republican party itself were placed under\r\nthe deepest obligation to these men for their courage and independent\r\naction. They saved the country from the direst results of the great\r\npolitical scandal of the age, and they saved the Republican party from\r\nthe commission of a deed which would have destroyed its hold upon the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The truth of the matter.]\r\n\r\nThe truth of the whole matter is that, while Mr. Johnson was an unfit\r\nperson to be President of the United States--which may be also affirmed\r\nof some others who have occupied the high place--he was utterly and\r\nentirely guiltless of the commission of any crime or misdemeanor. He\r\nwas {192} low-born and low-bred, violent in temper, obstinate, coarse,\r\nvindictive, and lacking in the sense of propriety, but he was not\r\nbehind any of his accusers in patriotism and loyalty to the country,\r\nand in his willingness to sacrifice every personal advantage for the\r\nmaintenance of the Union and the preservation of the Government. In\r\nfact, most of them were pygmies in these qualities beside him. It is\r\ntrue that he differed with them somewhat in his conception of what\r\nmeasures were for the welfare of the country and what not, but the\r\nsequel has shown that he was nearer right than they in this respect.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The abdication of Stanton.]\r\n\r\nSo soon as the Court of Impeachment pronounced its acquittal of the\r\nPresident, Mr. Stanton addressed to the President a letter announcing\r\nhis relinquishment of the War Department, and his delivery of the\r\npapers and properties thereof to General Townsend, subject to the\r\nPresident's directions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Schofield's confirmation as Secretary of War and his\r\nacceptance of the office.]\r\n\r\nThe Senate now confirmed the nomination of General Schofield to be\r\nSecretary of War. The General at once accepted the appointment and\r\nentered upon the duties of his office, and administered these duties to\r\nthe end of his term, according to his own testimony, in perfect harmony\r\nwith the President.\r\n\r\nSome of Stanton's friends have tried to make out that but for Stanton's\r\nresistance and the impeachment, and its nearness to success, Johnson\r\nwould have appointed a tool of his own to the War Office and have rode\r\nrough-shod over the laws of the land, and that he was frightened out of\r\nthis purpose, and frightened into an implied agreement with certain\r\nSenators and General Schofield that the Reconstruction laws should be\r\nexecuted as Stanton understood them, and not as the President\r\nunderstood them. There is little ground for {193} any such assumptions.\r\nThere is certainly none in the character of the men whom the President\r\nasked to take the War Office, Grant, Sherman and Ewing; and it must be\r\nremembered that through Mr. Stanbery, in the case of Mississippi vs.\r\nJohnson, he had long before announced to the Southerners that his\r\nopposition to the Reconstruction Acts ceased with his unsuccessful veto\r\nof them, and that he should execute them both in letter and in spirit.\r\nIt was Republican Senators who suggested to the President's counsel the\r\nnomination of General Schofield, a man entirely friendly with the\r\nPresident and acceptable to him. Neither the President nor the\r\nPresident's counsel approached any Senator with the proposition. It was\r\nthe Republican Senators who were frightened, rather than the President\r\nor his counsel. These Senators knew that the law and the evidence were\r\nwith the President, and that the Republican party was on trial, as much\r\nso as the President; and they knew that, if the Republican Senate\r\nshould, upon the showing made by the President's counsel of the law and\r\nthe evidence in the case, convict the President and remove him from\r\noffice, the party would stand arraigned before the people for having\r\ndestroyed the constitutional balance between the executive and the\r\nlegislature in order to gain a partisan end. They recognized the\r\ndilemma into which the hot-headed leaders of the party in the House of\r\nRepresentatives had, by their hasty impeachment procedure, brought the\r\nparty, and they were very much relieved to secure any understanding\r\nwith the President's counsel whereby the chance of averting the\r\ncatastrophe to the party, as well as to the country, might be\r\nincreased. The suspicion that Mr. Stanton was playing his part for the\r\npurpose of securing the Republican nomination for the presidency in\r\n1868, rather than from any motives of disinterested {194} patriotism,\r\nhas about as little foundation as has the theory of salutary terror,\r\nproduced by the impeachment, controlling the President's subsequent\r\nactions against his own preconceived plans and purposes. Both of these\r\nspeculations are no valid parts of the history of this great\r\ntransaction. What we have as certain facts are that the judgment was an\r\nacquittal, that it was rendered in accordance with law and evidence,\r\nand that it preserved the constitutional balance between the executive\r\nand the legislature in the governmental system of the country; and that\r\nfor this the judgment of history coincides with the judgment of the\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{195}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nRECONSTRUCTION RESUMED\r\n\r\nThe McCardle Case--The Congressional Acts Admitting the Senators- and\r\nRepresentatives-elect from the Reconstructed \"States\" to Seats in\r\nCongress--The Veto of these Bills by the President--The Vetoes\r\nOverridden--Ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment and the\r\nPresident's Proclamations Declaring Reconstruction Completed--Seward's\r\nProclamation Declaring the Ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment by\r\nthe Required Number of \"States\"--The Questions Suggested by Mr.\r\nSeward's First Proclamation--The Concurrent Resolution of Congress upon\r\nthese Questions--The Correct Procedure--The National Conventions of\r\n1868--Platform and Nominees of the Republican Party--Democratic\r\nPlatform and Nominees--The Election and the Electoral Vote--The Conduct\r\nof the President during the Campaign--Congress and the President--The\r\nPresident's Last Annual Message--The President's Amnesty Proclamation\r\nof December 25th, 1868--The President's Veto of the Bill in Regard to\r\nthe Colored Schools in the District of Columbia--The Fifteenth\r\nAmendment--Criticism of the Republican View--Johnson's Retirement from\r\nthe Presidency--The President and the Republican Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The McCardle case.]\r\n\r\nDuring the period of the impeachment trial, a case was in progress\r\nbefore the Supreme Court of the United States, which in its final\r\nsettlement was destined to deprive the President of any hope that a\r\njudicial decision in regard to the constitutionality of the\r\nReconstruction Acts could ever be attained. We have seen that in the\r\ncases of Mississippi vs. Johnson and of Georgia vs. Stanton the\r\nPresident had resisted the jurisdiction of the Court when {196} aimed\r\ndirectly at the Executive and his immediate agents. This was his duty,\r\nand he performed it sincerely and successfully. But it is not to be\r\ninferred from this that he would not have welcomed a judicial decision\r\nfrom the Supreme Court of the United States pronouncing these Acts null\r\nand void, if it could have been reached through the forms of a proper\r\ncase, one not involving the executive authority at all.\r\n\r\nSuch a case had appeared in this Court in the winter term of 1867-68,\r\nand the argument as to the jurisdiction of the Court, and the decision\r\nof this point in the affirmative, had both been made before the\r\nimpeachment trial began. One William H. McCardle, arrested and held by\r\nthe military authorities in Mississippi for trial before a military\r\ncommission on charge of having published in a newspaper, of which he\r\nwas editor, libellous and incendiary articles, petitioned the Circuit\r\nCourt of the United States for a writ of Habeas Corpus. The writ was\r\nissued, and return was made by the military commander, General A. C.\r\nGillem, admitting the arrest and detention of McCardle, but contending\r\nthat these acts were lawful. The Circuit Court, on the 25th of\r\nNovember, 1867, remanded McCardle, who had been held in custody between\r\nthe time of the return to the writ and this date by the United States\r\nmarshal, to the custody of General Gillem. McCardle then appealed from\r\nthis judgment of the Circuit Court to the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates. Upon a motion to dismiss the appeal, made by the counsel of the\r\nmilitary authorities, this Court decided that under the statute of\r\nFebruary 5th, 1867, the Supreme Court of the United States could hear\r\nthe appeal, and denied the motion to dismiss it.\r\n\r\nThe question was now before the Supreme Court upon its merits, and it\r\ninvolved the constitutionality {197} of the Reconstruction Acts. It was\r\nargued very ably, and the part of the Reconstruction Acts putting the\r\ndistricts of the South under martial law two years after the Civil War\r\nhad ended, and when the civil authority of the United States was\r\neverywhere recognized and enforced, was pretty clearly shown to have\r\nbeen a very serious stretching of its powers by Congress, if not a\r\ndistinct usurpation. The Republicans in Congress were greatly\r\nfrightened, and while the case was under advisement in the Court, they\r\nhastened to repeal the Act of February 5th, 1867, and to make the\r\nrepeal apply to appeals already taken under that Act, as well as to\r\nsuch as might be attempted in the future. The repealing bill was vetoed\r\nby the President on the 25th of March, but it was immediately repassed\r\nby the majority necessary to override the veto, repassed without the\r\nslightest regard to the President's very sound and convincing\r\nobjections. This Act of the 27th of March was intended to prevent any\r\ndecision upon the constitutionality of the Reconstruction Acts, and did\r\ndo so most effectively, but it was an abominable subterfuge on the part\r\nof Congress and a shameful abuse of its powers.\r\n\r\nAs will be remembered, seven of the ten Southern communities, viz.,\r\nNorth Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Florida, Louisiana,\r\nand Arkansas, had already before the close of the impeachment trial\r\nratified the \"State\" constitutions framed for them by the \"carpet-bag,\r\nscalawag, negro conventions\" held in each for them, had elected \"State\"\r\nofficers and legislators, and the legislature of one of them, Arkansas,\r\nhad ratified the proposed Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of\r\nthe United States, as the legislature of each of them was required to\r\ndo before it could be admitted to representation in Congress.\r\n\r\n{198} [Sidenote: The Congressional Acts admitting the Senators- and\r\nRepresentatives-elect from the reconstructed \"States\" to seats in\r\nCongress.]\r\n\r\nCongress now looked upon the work of its hands and pronounced it good,\r\nand proceeded to pass the acts, necessary in its conceit, to admit\r\nthese communities to representation in the legislative houses of the\r\nNation. First came the Act in reference to Arkansas, of the 22d of\r\nJune, 1868, since, as has been just said, the new legislature of\r\nArkansas had already ratified the proposed Fourteenth Amendment. It\r\nprovided \"that the State of Arkansas is entitled and admitted to\r\nrepresentation in Congress, as one of the States of the Union, on the\r\nfollowing fundamental condition: That the constitution of Arkansas\r\nshall never be so amended or changed as to deprive any citizen, or\r\nclass of citizens, of the United States of the right to vote who are\r\nentitled to vote by the constitution herein recognized, except as a\r\npunishment for such crimes as are now felonies at common law, whereof\r\nthey shall have been duly convicted under laws equally applicable to\r\nall the inhabitants of said State: Provided that any alteration of said\r\nconstitution prospective in its effect may be made in regard to the\r\ntime and place of residence of voters.\"\r\n\r\nThree days later, that is on the 25th, Congress provided in a single\r\nact for the admission of the Senators and Representatives from the\r\nother six reconstructed \"States\" to the national legislature in the\r\nfollowing language: \"_Be it enacted, &c._, That each of the States of\r\nNorth Carolina, South Carolina, Louisiana, Georgia, Alabama, and\r\nFlorida, shall be entitled and admitted to representation in Congress\r\nas a State of the Union when the legislature of such State shall have\r\nduly ratified the Amendment to the Constitution of the United States\r\nproposed by the Thirty-ninth Congress, and known as Article XIV., upon\r\nthe following fundamental {199} conditions: That the constitution of\r\nneither of said States shall ever be so amended or changed as to\r\ndeprive any citizen, or class of citizens, of the United States of the\r\nright to vote in said State who are entitled to vote by the\r\nconstitution thereof, herein recognized, except as a punishment for\r\nsuch crimes as are now felonies at common law, whereof they shall have\r\nbeen duly convicted under laws equally applicable to all the\r\ninhabitants of said State: _Provided_, that any alteration of said\r\nconstitutions may be made with regard to the time and place of\r\nresidence of voters.\" It was also further provided that the legislature\r\nof Georgia should, by solemn public act, declare its assent to the\r\nfundamental condition that the article of the new constitution of\r\nGeorgia prohibiting the courts within the \"State\" from entertaining any\r\nsuit against any resident of the \"State\" for any debt existing prior to\r\nJune 1st, 1865, and prohibiting the judicial and ministerial officers\r\nof the \"State\" from executing any process in reference to such debts,\r\nshould be considered and treated as null and void.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The veto of these bills by the President.]\r\n\r\nThe President had placed his veto on both of these bills. The veto of\r\nthe Arkansas bill bears the date of June 20th, and that of the other\r\nbill bears the date of June 25th. There are parts of the President's\r\nargument which are entirely convincing to any candid mind at the\r\npresent day. He pointed out that the fundamental condition imposed by\r\nCongress, in all these cases, upon the admission of Senators and\r\nRepresentatives to Congress, viz., that no change should ever be made\r\nin the suffrage qualifications provided in these \"State\" constitutions\r\nwhereby any citizen or class of citizens of the United States having\r\nthe right to vote under these constitutions should be deprived of such\r\nright, was an assumption of power by Congress to regulate a subject,\r\nwithin the \"States,\" which by the {200} existing Constitution of the\r\nUnited States belonged exclusively to the \"States,\" to each \"State\" for\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThere can be no question that the President was entirely correct in\r\nthis contention. The Fifteenth Amendment was as yet no part of the\r\nConstitution. It had not even been proposed by Congress to the\r\n\"States.\" It is very questionable whether a majority in Congress could\r\nhave been found, at that time, in favor of making such a proposition,\r\nmuch less the required extraordinary majority of two-thirds. And until\r\nthe Fifteenth Amendment had been ratified as a part of the Constitution\r\nof the United States, Congress had no power to exact such a concession,\r\nor anything like it, from any \"State\" as the price of the admission of\r\nrepresentatives from it to the Houses of the National Legislature. And\r\neven since the Fifteenth Amendment has become a part of the\r\nConstitution, the Government of the United States cannot prohibit such\r\nchanges in a \"State\" constitution, unless the deprivation of suffrage\r\nis made on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.\r\n\r\nThe President also called attention to the fact that no way was\r\nprovided in the bills whereby the \"States\" should signify their\r\nacceptance of this \"fundamental condition\" of admission to\r\nrepresentation in Congress, and that no penalty was prescribed for a\r\nviolation of the condition. Did Congress mean that, in case of any\r\nviolation of its \"fundamental condition,\" it would throw the \"State\"\r\nback under martial law, and proceed to reconstruct anew? That was a\r\nquestion which might well be asked in view of what Congress had already\r\ndone; and it was a question which was not calculated to allay\r\nuneasiness in the minds of the people in the Southern communities.\r\n\r\n{201} Finally, in the veto of the Arkansas bill, the President\r\nexpressed his very serious doubts whether the new \"State\" constitution\r\nhad been ratified by the electorate created by the Acts of Congress for\r\nthat purpose, since a section in that constitution prescribed that no\r\nperson would be allowed to vote upon the ratification of the\r\nconstitution who had not previously taken an oath to the effect \"that\r\nhe accepted the doctrine of the civil and political equality of all\r\nmen, and agreed not to attempt to deprive any person or persons, on\r\naccount of race, color, or previous condition, of any political or\r\ncivil right, privilege or immunity enjoyed by any other class of men,\"\r\nthus adding a new qualification for registration and voting to those\r\nprescribed in the Reconstruction Acts of Congress. There is no question\r\nthat the President was right about this, too. And there is no question\r\nthat this new qualification was entirely null and void, in so far as it\r\napplied to voting upon, and registering to vote upon, the ratification\r\nof the constitution itself, unless we ascribe constituent power to the\r\nconvention which framed the constitution, instead of the power of\r\ninitiation only. We know that no constitutional convention has, or then\r\nhad, any such powers in our system. It was nothing more or less than a\r\npalpable usurpation of constituent power when the convention in\r\nArkansas presumed to add this qualification to those prescribed by\r\nCongress for voting upon the ratification of the constitution itself.\r\nOf course it would have been lawful and regular for the \"State\"\r\nconstitution to make this additional requirement for voting in all\r\nfuture elections, after the constitution prescribing it should have\r\nbeen adopted by the electorate created by the Congressional Acts,\r\nalthough the requirement itself would have been unreasonable and\r\noppressive. But for the convention, a mere proposing {202} body, to\r\nordain this new qualification for voting on the question of the\r\nadoption of the constitution itself was a political outrage of the\r\nfirst order.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The vetoes overridden.]\r\n\r\nCongress was not, however, in a state of mind to listen to any\r\nsuggestions from the President, no matter how correct and important\r\nthey might be. Both Houses promptly, almost mockingly, passed the two\r\nbills over the President's vetoes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment and the President's\r\nproclamations declaring Reconstruction completed.]\r\n\r\nSuch of the legislatures created under the new \"State\" constitutions as\r\nwere not already in session were quickly summoned to assemble, and by\r\nJuly 21st all of them had ratified the proposed Fourteenth Amendment to\r\nthe Constitution of the United States, and the legislature of Georgia\r\nhad also pledged by solemn act that the repudiation article of the new\r\nconstitution should never be enforced. By July 27th the President had\r\nissued his several proclamations, as required by the Act of June 25th,\r\nannouncing the ratification of the proposed Fourteenth Amendment by\r\nthese legislatures, and consequently the admission of these \"States\" to\r\nrepresentation in Congress; and so far as the seven \"States\" of\r\nArkansas, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Florida and\r\nLouisiana were concerned the work of reconstruction was now completed.\r\nVirginia, Mississippi and Texas still remained under martial law.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Seward's proclamation declaring the ratification of the\r\nFourteenth Amendment by the required number of \"States.\"]\r\n\r\nOn the 28th day of July, Mr. Seward, the Secretary of State, issued his\r\nproclamation, declaring the ratification of the proposed Fourteenth\r\nAmendment to the Constitution of the United States by the legislatures\r\nof thirty States of the Union, and its consequent validity as a part of\r\nthe Constitution of the United States.\r\n\r\n{203} [Sidenote: The questions suggested by Mr. Seward's first\r\nproclamation.]\r\n\r\nEight days before this proclamation, that is on the 20th, Mr. Seward\r\nhad issued a proclamation declaring that the legislatures of\r\ntwenty-three States, viz., of Connecticut, New Hampshire, Tennessee,\r\nNew Jersey, Oregon, Vermont, New York, Ohio, Illinois, West Virginia,\r\nKansas, Maine, Nevada, Missouri, Indiana, Minnesota, Rhode Island,\r\nWisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Massachusetts, Nebraska and Iowa,\r\nhad ratified the proposed Fourteenth Amendment, and that six\r\n\"newly-constituted and newly-established bodies avowing themselves to\r\nbe, and acting as, the legislatures, respectively, of the States of\r\nArkansas, Florida, North Carolina, Louisiana, South Carolina, and\r\nAlabama\" had also ratified it; that the legislatures of Ohio and New\r\nJersey had subsequently passed resolutions withdrawing their\r\nratification of the Amendment; and that, if these latter resolutions of\r\nthe legislatures of Ohio and New Jersey should be disregarded, the\r\nproposed Fourteenth Amendment had been adopted by the legislatures of\r\ntwenty-nine of the thirty-seven \"States\" of the Union and had thus\r\nbecome a valid part of the Constitution of the United States.\r\n\r\nBesides the question expressed in this Proclamation, Mr. Seward\r\nindicates by his language a further question, viz., whether the six\r\n\"newly-constituted and newly-established bodies, avowing themselves to\r\nbe, and acting as, the legislatures, respectively, of the States of\r\nArkansas, Florida, North Carolina, Louisiana, South Carolina, and\r\nAlabama\" were genuine \"State\" legislatures. They were the legislatures\r\nestablished under the Reconstruction Acts of Congress, but as Congress\r\nhad refused to recognize the \"States\" for whom these bodies acted as\r\nentitled to representation in Congress, that is as \"States\" having the\r\nrights of \"States\" of the Union, until {204} after these bodies had\r\nratified the proposed Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States, it was no wonder that so good a constitutional lawyer\r\nand so logical a thinker as Mr. Seward had his doubts as to whether\r\nthese bodies were genuine \"State\" legislatures.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The concurrent resolution of Congress upon these questions.]\r\n\r\nIn order to quiet these doubts, if possible, the two Houses of Congress\r\npassed on the following day, July 21st, the following concurrent\r\nresolution: \"Whereas the legislatures of the States of Connecticut,\r\nTennessee, _New Jersey_, Oregon, Vermont, West Virginia, Kansas,\r\nMissouri, Indiana, _Ohio_, Illinois, Minnesota, New York, Wisconsin,\r\nPennsylvania, Rhode Island, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire,\r\nMassachusetts, Nebraska, Maine, Iowa, _Arkansas_, _Florida_, _North\r\nCarolina_, _Alabama_, _South Carolina_ and _Louisiana_, being\r\nthree-fourths and more of the several States of the Union, have\r\nratified the Fourteenth Article of Amendment to the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States, duly proposed by two-thirds of each House of the\r\nThirty-ninth Congress; therefore, Resolved by the Senate (the House of\r\nRepresentatives concurring), That said Fourteenth Article is hereby\r\ndeclared to be a part of the Constitution of the United States, and it\r\nshall be duly promulgated as such by the Secretary of State.\" Upon the\r\nbasis of this resolution, which decided, in so far as Congress can\r\ndecide, that the consent of the legislature of a \"State\" to a proposed\r\namendment to the Constitution of the United States cannot be withdrawn\r\nwhen once given, and that the \"newly-constituted and newly-established\r\nbodies, avowing themselves to be, and acting as, the legislatures,\r\nrespectively, of the States of Arkansas, Florida, North Carolina,\r\nLouisiana, South Carolina, and Alabama\" were genuine \"State\"\r\nlegislatures qualified to {205} vote upon the ratification of a\r\nproposed amendment to the Constitution of the United States, Mr. Seward\r\nissued his proclamation of the 28th of July, above recited. As the\r\nGeorgia Legislature ratified the proposed amendment on the 21st inst.\r\nand also gave its pledge not to allow the repudiation article in its\r\nconstitution to be enforced, Mr. Seward included Georgia in this last\r\nproclamation.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that both Mr. Seward and Congress counted all of the\r\nSouthern communities which had ever been \"States\" as being \"States,\"\r\nmaking the whole number of \"States\" thirty-seven, and the number\r\nnecessary for ratification of the amendment twenty-eight. Upon this\r\nbasis of calculation two more than the necessary number had ratified at\r\nthe date of Mr. Seward's final proclamation. It will also be seen that\r\nboth Mr. Seward and Congress, that is that both the legislative and\r\nexecutive departments of the Government, ignored the attempt of Ohio\r\nand New Jersey to withdraw their consent to the amendment, and fixed\r\nthe precedent in the constitutional practice of the United States that\r\na \"State\" legislature cannot reconsider its ratification of an\r\namendment to the Constitution of the United States at any time. This\r\nmeans, when scientifically appreciated, that the ratification of an\r\namendment to the Constitution of the United States is not an agreement\r\nbetween the \"States,\" and therefore becomes valid as to each only after\r\nthree-fourths of the \"States,\" the constitutional number necessary to\r\nmake the proposed amendment a valid part of the Constitution, shall\r\nhave ratified it, but that ratification by a \"State\" legislature, and\r\n_a fortiori_ by a convention of the people within a \"State,\" is only an\r\nindirect vote of a part of the people of the United States upon a\r\nquestion submitted to the suffrages of the whole people of the United\r\nStates. When, {206} therefore, this affirmative vote has been once\r\nofficially announced by the proper authorities within the \"State\" to\r\nthe proper authorities of the United States there is no further control\r\nover it by the authorities within the \"State.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The correct procedure.]\r\n\r\nIf, however, the votes of Ohio and New Jersey had not been counted in\r\nthe affirmative, there was still a three-fourths majority of\r\nthirty-seven \"States\" in favor of ratification. And if the ten Southern\r\ncommunities had been left out of the computation altogether, which\r\nwould have made the Union to consist, so far as that part of it erected\r\ninto \"States\" was concerned, of twenty-seven \"States,\" there would\r\nstill have been more than a three-fourths majority in favor of\r\nratification, with or without Ohio and New Jersey. The correct\r\nprocedure, from a scientific point of view, would undoubtedly have been\r\nto have computed the necessary majority upon the basis of twenty-seven\r\n\"States,\" to have included Ohio and New Jersey among the \"States\" whose\r\nlegislatures voted for ratification, and then to have admitted the ten\r\nSouthern communities as \"States\" under the Constitution of the United\r\nStates, _with the Fourteenth Amendment as an already established part\r\nof it_, concerning which they had no more to say than they had in\r\nregard to any other part of the Constitution. But, however that may be,\r\nno objection can be made to the validity of the Fourteenth Amendment on\r\nthe ground of the majority by which it was ratified. In whatever way we\r\nmay compute the whole number of \"States\" and the majority voting in the\r\naffirmative, the Amendment was lawfully ratified.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The national conventions of 1868.]\r\n\r\nDuring these movements in execution of the Reconstruction Acts, the\r\nnational party conventions for the nomination of candidates for the\r\npresidency and for the formation of platforms were held. That of the\r\n{207} Republican party assembled first, on the twenty-first day of May\r\nin Chicago, at the moment when its radical elements were filled with\r\nrage and chagrin at the failure of the impeachment of the President.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Platform and nominees of the Republican party.]\r\n\r\nIt made General Joseph R. Hawley, of Connecticut, its presiding\r\nofficer; adopted a platform, a large part of which was devoted to\r\ndenunciation of the President, to the promise of bountiful pensions,\r\nand to a twist of the British lion's tail on the subject of\r\nexpatriation; the main principles of which, however, were good faith in\r\nthe payment of the public debt with sound money, and equal suffrage by\r\nCongressional law in the Southern communities; and nominated Grant and\r\nColfax for the presidency and the vice-presidency.\r\n\r\nIn pronouncing for the guaranty of negro suffrage at the South by\r\nCongressional law, the platform attempted to steer clear of the\r\nprejudices against negro suffrage at the North by a sort of proviso,\r\nwhich read, \"While the question of suffrage in all the loyal States\r\nproperly belongs to the people of those States.\" This was certainly\r\ninconsistent, not to say hypocritical. Negro suffrage at the North\r\nwould have been a comparatively harmless thing on account of the\r\nfewness of the negroes as compared with the whites in that section, and\r\non account of the superior average intelligence of the negroes of the\r\nNorth when compared with that of those of the South. There was no sound\r\nprinciple in this article of the platform. It was a mean, shuffling bit\r\nof partisan politics. The party itself felt it to be so in the course\r\nof the campaign, and came out finally for the settlement of the whole\r\nquestion of negro suffrage upon the same basis for the whole country\r\nand by means of a constitutional amendment.\r\n\r\n{208} The nominees immediately accepted their nominations in\r\ncharacteristic letters, that of General Grant being short, crisp,\r\nmodest and ending with the now famous sentence: \"Let us have peace,\"\r\nand that of Colfax being more lengthy and wordy and containing a\r\nrhetorical defence of some of the more questionable parts of the\r\nplatform.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Democratic platform and nominees.]\r\n\r\nThe Democratic convention assembled in New York on the 4th day of July.\r\nIt was confronted at the start with the Greenback heresy, and the\r\ncandidacy of the Greenback champion for the presidency, Mr. George H.\r\nPendleton of Ohio. This heresy was in a sentence the doctrine that all\r\nthe public debt of the United States not made expressly payable in coin\r\nshould be paid in United States paper, which Congress might order to be\r\nstamped, issued, and made legal tender, to any amount it might please.\r\nThe shibboleth was, \"the same currency for the bondholder and the\r\nplough-holder.\" It had taken firm hold in Ohio, and was rapidly\r\nspreading through the valley of the Mississippi. The Eastern Democrats,\r\nhowever, looked upon it with disfavor, and were determined to defeat\r\nthe nomination of Mr. Pendleton. They were obliged, however, to accept\r\nthe platform, in so far as it related to this subject, as dictated by\r\ntheir Western compatriots. The third plank in the platform read, \"...\r\nand where the obligations of the Government do not expressly state upon\r\ntheir face, or the law under which they were issued does not provide,\r\nthat they shall be paid in coin, they ought in right and in justice to\r\nbe paid in the lawful money of the United States.\" The fifth plank also\r\nread, \"one currency for the Government and the people, the laborer and\r\nthe officeholder, the pensioner and the soldier, the producer and the\r\nbondholder.\" It is true that the {209} platform did not expressly\r\npronounce in favor of an unlimited issue of paper money with which to\r\npay the bonds, but it was generally understood that this was what was\r\nmeant. The questions then of sound money and of the faithful discharge\r\nof the public obligations were thus put in issue. The Democrats also\r\nmet squarely the Republican doctrine of Reconstruction. They demanded\r\nthe \"immediate restoration of all the States to their rights in the\r\nUnion under the Constitution, and of civil government to the American\r\npeople,\" with \"amnesty for all past political offences, and the\r\nregulation of the election franchise in the States by their citizens.\"\r\nAnd they denounced the Radical party, as they termed the Republicans,\r\n\"for its disregard of right, and the unparalleled oppression and\r\ntyranny which have marked its career,\" declared the Reconstruction Acts\r\nto be unconstitutional, revolutionary and void, and lauded President\r\nJohnson for his unflinching resistance to \"the aggressions of Congress\r\nupon the constitutional rights of the States and the people.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Weakness of the platform.]\r\n\r\nThere is no question that the platform of the Democrats, with its paper\r\nmoney doctrine, and its hostility to Reconstruction and universal\r\nsuffrage, was a shaky foundation for any party to attempt to stand upon\r\nat that juncture. Not much conscience and not much sentiment could be\r\naroused with such tenets. Conscience and sentiment were much more\r\namenable to the appeals of the Republican platform upon these points.\r\nMoreover, the tremendous popularity of the Republican candidates had to\r\nbe reckoned with. Where could the Democrats find a candidate who would\r\nboth match Grant in the popular affection and overbalance also the\r\nweakness of the platform? The New Yorkers in the convention, led by\r\nSeymour, Tilden, Schell and Kernan, {210} had their man for this\r\nemergency, but they dared not reveal at the outset their plan. They\r\nwere resolved to nominate Chief Justice Chase. They thought that\r\nChase's well-known devotion to the principles of universal suffrage and\r\nhis career as Secretary of the Treasury would satisfy the Eastern men\r\nin regard to the platform, and that his attachment to the principles of\r\ncivil government versus militarism would, in some degree at least,\r\nneutralize the popularity of the military hero. The delegates from\r\nOhio, Mr. Chase's own \"State,\" suspected the purpose of the New\r\nYorkers, and were determined to foil it. If they could not get\r\nPendleton, they were determined not to have Chase. After the first six\r\nballots without result, Pendleton, however, leading, the New Yorkers\r\nbrought forward Hendricks of Indiana, in order to break down\r\nPendleton's vote. Having succeeded in this after some six more ballots,\r\nthe name of Chase was brought before the convention by a half vote from\r\nCalifornia. The purpose was probably to feel of the convention. It was\r\nhighly successful. The announcement of the half vote was received with\r\nenthusiastic applause. Masking themselves behind Hancock, who was at\r\nthat juncture in the lead, and Hendricks, the New Yorkers now prepared\r\nto present Chase; but the Ohioans were too quick for them. They\r\nsucceeded in withdrawing Pendleton and presenting Seymour himself as\r\ntheir candidate, before the New Yorkers knew what they were about.\r\nSeymour, who was occupying the presidency of the convention, declared\r\nfrom his seat that he could not accept, but the Ohioans stuck to their\r\nnomination, and the New Yorkers had to assent. They were fairly caught\r\nin their own net.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The nominees.]\r\n\r\nSeymour finally yielded, and the convention addressed itself to the\r\nnomination of its candidate for the vice-presidency. The ex-Confederate\r\nGeneral William Preston of {211} Kentucky presented the name of the\r\nnoted Union General Francis P. Blair of Missouri for the place. The\r\nnomination was seconded by the ex-Confederate General Wade Hampton of\r\nSouth Carolina, and was made by acclamation. While General Blair was a\r\nnoted Union soldier of high ability and undoubted loyalty, he was a\r\nfierce enemy of the Reconstruction Acts of Congress, and was for this\r\nreason very popular with the ex-Confederates. In an open letter to\r\nColonel J. O. Brodhead of St. Louis, written five days before the\r\nassembly of the Democratic convention, he not only denounced the\r\nReconstruction Acts as unconstitutional, but advanced a method for\r\ngetting rid of them and their effects in case a Democratic President\r\nshould be elected. He proposed that the new President should \"declare\r\nthese Acts null and void, compel the army to undo its usurpations at\r\nthe South, disperse the carpet-bag State governments, allow the white\r\npeople to reorganize their own governments, and elect Senators and\r\nRepresentatives.\" He said, further, that the House of Representatives\r\nwould contain a majority of Democrats from the North, who would admit\r\nthe members elected to that body from the South to seats, and that the\r\nHouse with the President would exert such a pressure on the Senate as\r\nto cause the doors of that body to be opened to the members from the\r\nSouthern \"States.\" When General Blair wrote this letter he was being\r\nspoken of as a candidate for the presidency, and this letter was taken\r\nas the declaration of what he would do if elected to the position of\r\nChief Magistrate of the nation. After his nomination for the\r\nvice-presidency, in his speech and letter of acceptance, he announced\r\nthe chief issue in the contest to be the relief of the South from\r\nmartial law and negro domination. The ex-Confederates represented it\r\nthe same way at the South, and threw themselves into {212} the campaign\r\nwith great enthusiasm for Seymour and Blair.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the bland, politic and persuasive Seymour pursued a\r\nmuch more moderate and conciliatory course, and when it became evident\r\nthat General Blair's violent expressions and revolutionary purposes\r\nwere ruining the Democratic prospects at the North, he went into the\r\ncampaign personally, and by his diplomatic manners and fine oratory\r\nsucceeded in stemming the tide which, running against the Democrats\r\nfrom the moment when their platform was proclaimed, had been driven on\r\nto a flood by General Blair's indiscretions, to put it very mildly, in\r\nspeech and conduct. But while some lost ground was regained, it was\r\nevident that the hopes of the Democrats had been blasted.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The election and the electoral vote.]\r\n\r\nThe electoral votes of thirty-four \"States\" were counted, Virginia,\r\nMississippi and Texas being still regarded by Congress as\r\nunreconstructed. Of these thirty-four, eight cast their votes for\r\nSeymour and Blair. These were New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland,\r\nKentucky, Oregon, Georgia and Louisiana. The rest went for Grant and\r\nColfax. The electoral vote stood eighty for Seymour and Blair and two\r\nhundred and fourteen for Grant and Colfax. The popular vote stood two\r\nmillions seven hundred and three thousand two hundred and forty-nine\r\nfor Seymour and Blair, and three millions and twelve thousand eight\r\nhundred and thirty-three for Grant and Colfax. The exclusion of\r\nVirginia, Mississippi and Texas from the vote and the inclusion of the\r\nsuffrages of the \"carpet-baggers\" and the negroes, under the protection\r\nof the military, in the reconstructed \"States,\" had saved the day for\r\nGrant and Colfax. If the electorate of the South had been as in 1860,\r\nor probably as it was in the years of the Johnson governments, Seymour\r\nand Blair {213} would have triumphed. As it was, but for the Greenback\r\nplank in the Democratic platform and the indiscretions of General\r\nBlair, they might have triumphed. That is to say, if the Reconstruction\r\npolicy of Congress had been the sole issue, it is quite possible that\r\nthe Republicans would have lost the election, even with the most\r\npopular man in the North as their standard bearer.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The conduct of the President during the campaign.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the President had continued to ply the Congress with his\r\nvetoes and messages and to address the country with his proclamations.\r\nHe had thought that he ought to be vindicated by being nominated by the\r\nDemocrats for the presidency, and had actually received sixty-five\r\nvotes on the first ballot. His failure before the convention ought to\r\nhave taught him that he was no longer a factor to be reckoned with in\r\nthe domain of politics, and that his proper course was to execute\r\nquietly the functions of his office to the end of his term, and then\r\nretire to private life. But he seemed to think that his political\r\nopinions were still of great value, and in a very few days after the\r\nadjournment of the Democratic convention he addressed a message to\r\nCongress advising a most radical change in the structure of the\r\ngovernment by means of constitutional amendment. He therein recommended\r\nthat Congress should propose to the \"States\" so to amend the\r\nConstitution as to provide for the election of the President and\r\nVice-President by a direct vote of the people, for the ineligibility of\r\nthese officers for a second term, for the designation of the members of\r\nthe Cabinet in a certain order, beginning with the Secretary of State,\r\nas the persons to discharge the duties of the President in case of a\r\nvacancy in the presidential office by the death, resignation or removal\r\nof both the President and the Vice-President, for the election of the\r\nSenators by the direct vote of the people, {214} and for the limitation\r\nof the terms of the United States judges to a period of years. There\r\nwas sound reason for the third of these suggestions, the designation by\r\nthe Constitution of the Cabinet officers in a certain order as the\r\nsuccessors to the powers and duties of the President, when the country\r\nmight be without both a President and a Vice-President, and it has\r\nsince then been made law under the form of a statute of Congress.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Congress and the President.]\r\n\r\nBut the Congress was not then in a mood to hear anything from Mr.\r\nJohnson. Two days later, July 20th, the President vetoed the joint\r\nresolution passed by the two Houses, excluding from the electoral\r\ncollege in the coming presidential election the votes of \"States\"\r\nlately in rebellion which should not have been reorganized under the\r\nReconstruction Acts of Congress. In this veto he went over his whole\r\nargument once more against the constitutionality of these Acts and in\r\nfavor of his own method of Reconstruction. But the Congress treated the\r\nmessage with contempt and promptly repassed the resolution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The President's last annual Message.]\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of December President Johnson sent his last annual Message\r\nto Congress. It was a grave, dignified and statesmanlike document both\r\nin form and content. In it he told Congress plainly and respectfully\r\nthat its Reconstruction policy had arrayed the races against each other\r\nat the South, had impaired, if not destroyed, the kindly relations that\r\nhad previously existed between them, and had given mortal offence to\r\nthe civilized race by placing the uncivilized race in domination over\r\nit; and he urged that legislation which had produced such baleful\r\nconsequences ought to be abrogated. He also told Congress that it had\r\nseriously impaired the power of the President to exact the necessary\r\naccountability of the public officers by its Tenure-of-Office Act, and\r\nhad embarrassed {215} the Executive in the exercise of his\r\nconstitutional military functions by the Act of March 2d, 1867; and he\r\nurged the repeal of both of these measures. He also gave a most serious\r\nand startling account of the condition of the public finances, and of\r\nthe consumption of the wealth of the Nation by the bondholders,\r\nofficials and pensioners. He pointed out that the public debt, which in\r\n1860 was 64,000,000 dollars, had become 2,527,129,552 dollars; that the\r\nannual expenditure, which was, in 1860, 63,000,000 dollars, had become\r\n336,000,000 dollars and more, and that the expenditure per capita,\r\nwhich was two dollars in 1860, had become nearly ten dollars. And he\r\nsuggested the ways in which this threatening condition might be\r\nrelieved, viz., by a refunding of the bonds at a lower interest, by a\r\nspeedy resumption of specie payment, by a reduction of the army and of\r\nthe horde of Reconstruction officials in the South, and by a strict\r\naccountability of the revenue officials to their superiors and of these\r\nlatter to the President. From the point of view of sound political\r\nscience, good public policy and true patriotism all of these\r\nsuggestions were at least worth consideration, but Congress took no\r\nmore notice of them than it did of the distant murmurs of the waters of\r\nthe Potomac.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The President's amnesty proclamation of December 25th,\r\n1868.]\r\n\r\nOnly once again did the Congress break over its apparent resolve to\r\nignore the President, and that was upon the occasion of his issue of\r\nhis universal and unconditional pardon and amnesty to all persons who\r\nhad participated, either directly or indirectly, in the rebellion, with\r\nthe restoration of all their rights, privileges and immunities under\r\nthe Constitution and the laws made in pursuance thereof. The date of\r\nthis document was December 25th, 1868. On the 5th of January, 1869, the\r\nSenate called him to account for this by a {216} resolution calling\r\nupon him \"to transmit to the Senate a copy of any proclamation of\r\namnesty made by him since the last adjournment of Congress, and also to\r\ncommunicate to the Senate by what authority of law the same was made.\"\r\nThe President replied on the 18th, sending a copy of his proclamation\r\nof December 25th, 1868, and declaring that he issued it by authority of\r\nthe second section of Article second of the Constitution, which vested\r\nin the President the power to grant reprieves and pardons for offences\r\nagainst the United States, except in cases of impeachment, and in\r\naccordance with precedents established by his predecessors in office,\r\nWashington, Adams, Madison and Lincoln. The Senate did not say that he\r\nhad no right to claim any constitutional prerogative, and that he was\r\nnot worthy to act under precedents set by Washington, Adams, Madison,\r\nand Lincoln, but most of the Senators evidently so thought. The\r\nproclamation had no effect upon the qualifications for suffrage in the\r\nface of the Reconstruction Acts and the \"State\" constitutions framed\r\nand established in accordance with them. It was little more than the\r\nbull against the comet.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The President's veto of the Bill in regard to the colored\r\nschools in the District of Columbia.]\r\n\r\nAs a sort of final stroke the President vetoed the bill concerning the\r\ntransfer of the control of the colored schools in the District of\r\nColumbia, and the bill for raising the duties on imported copper and\r\ncopper ores. He gave excellent reasons for both of these vetoes, but\r\nCongress had long ceased to be guided by reason in matters which\r\nrelated to the President.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Fifteenth Amendment.]\r\n\r\nOn its side it was busy with a project which, though not intended as a\r\nblow at him particularly, was not in accordance with his view that the\r\nregulation of the suffrage within the \"States\" was, and should be, left\r\nto the \"States\" respectively, and exclusively, viz., {217} the proposed\r\nFifteenth Amendment to the Constitution. Reference has already been\r\nmade to the inconsistent doctrine, we might almost say the timorous\r\nsubterfuge, of the Republican platform on the matter of negro suffrage,\r\nand to the growing conviction on the part of the Republicans during the\r\ncampaign that this question must be settled for the entire country\r\nalike, and by a constitutional amendment. At the opening of Congress in\r\nDecember, and during the first days of the session, the proposition was\r\npresented which finally took on the form given it by the conference\r\ncommittee of the two Houses in the words: \"The right of citizens of the\r\nUnited States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United\r\nStates or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition\r\nof servitude. The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by\r\nappropriate legislation.\" It was passed by both Houses with the\r\nrequisite two-thirds majority on the 26th of February and sent to the\r\nlegislatures of the \"States\" for ratification. The Republicans had at\r\nlast come to the view that the emancipation of the freedmen involved\r\ntheir civil equality with the whites, and that such equality could not\r\nbe maintained unless they possessed the elective franchise, and that it\r\nwas cowardly for the \"States\" of the North to force negro suffrage on\r\nthe South without accepting it for themselves.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Criticism of the Republican view.]\r\n\r\nIt is certainly true that full freedom implies civil liberty and civil\r\nequality, but there was another way, and a better way, to have secured\r\nthese than by the immediate and universal suffrage of the newly\r\nemancipated in all their ignorance, immorality and poverty, and that\r\nwas by the nationalization of civil liberty, and its protection and\r\nenforcement by the United States courts. Most of the {218} Republicans\r\nbelieved, at that moment, that that had been secured by the Fourteenth\r\nAmendment; and there can be little question that a very important\r\nconsideration with such was the fear that after Reconstruction should\r\nbe accomplished, the Southern \"States\" might amend negro suffrage out\r\nof their \"State\" constitutions, and thus destroy the Republican party\r\nin these \"States,\" unless the Constitution of the United States should\r\nbe so amended as to prevent it. The most radical among them were no\r\ndoubt moved chiefly by the extravagant humanitarianism of the period,\r\nwhich had developed in their minds to the point of justifying not only\r\nthe political equality of the races, but the political superiority, at\r\nleast in loyalty to the Union, the Constitution and republican\r\ngovernment, of the uncivilized negroes over the whites of the South;\r\nbut that this conviction was not very strong among the masses of them\r\ncan be readily concluded from the fact that that party is to-day the\r\nparty which is following the European idea of the duty of civilized\r\nraces to impose their political sovereignty upon uncivilized, or half\r\ncivilized, or not fully civilized, races anywhere and everywhere in the\r\nworld. No party can, in so short a time, so completely change its\r\nfundamental principle of political ethics when it is really and\r\nconscientiously believed in by the masses of the party.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Johnson's retirement from the presidency.]\r\n\r\nThis proposed Fifteenth Amendment was not sent to the President for his\r\napproval, but went, according to custom, to the Secretary of State, to\r\nbe submitted to the \"State\" legislatures. The President was now within\r\na very few days of the end of his term. His sun had fairly set, and the\r\ndisrespect felt for him by the members of the dominant party in\r\nCongress and out of Congress was expressed in the rude and quite\r\nunprecedented refusal of General Grant to sit in the same carriage with\r\nhim in the {219} procession from the White House to the Capitol, on the\r\n4th of March, for the ceremonies of the inauguration of the new\r\nPresident. Discredited, despised, and scoffed at, as a traitor to his\r\nparty, to his political creed, and to his country, Mr. Johnson stepped\r\ndown from the high office which he had occupied during one of the two\r\nmost critical periods in American history since the establishment of\r\nthe present Constitution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The President and the Republican party.]\r\n\r\nAnd yet it is certainly true that the Republican party had left him\r\nrather than that he had left the party. This party began simply as a\r\nUnion party and an anti-slavery extension party. Mr. Johnson, an\r\noriginal Democrat, joined with the Republicans upon this basis, and he\r\nnever left it. On the other hand, when the necessities of the war for\r\nthe Union made it evident that the slaves within the Southern\r\ncommunities which had declared secession, and were engaged in\r\nrebellion, must be proclaimed free, Mr. Johnson still went with the\r\nRepublicans in the justification of this measure. And when, finally,\r\nthe war was ended and the Union was preserved, and the Republicans\r\ndecided that the legitimate outcome of the victory was the prohibition\r\nof slavery everywhere within the United States by an amendment to the\r\nConstitution, Mr. Johnson still marched with them, at the head of the\r\ncolumn. It was only when they became more and more radical in their\r\npolicy, and insisted upon transforming rather than restoring the\r\n\"States\" of the South, by placing civil rights under national\r\nprotection instead of \"State\" protection, disfranchising the whites of\r\nthe South, and enfranchising the negroes, and upon overcoming the\r\nExecutive's objections to these movements not simply by overriding the\r\nveto, but by generally subordinating the Executive to Congress--it was\r\nonly then that he {220} separated from them and fell back naturally on\r\nsuch support as he could get, which was chiefly from the Democratic\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nNo fair mind can claim that the Republicans in their quarrel with the\r\nPresident had not departed from their solemn declaration made in\r\nCongress assembled in those dark July days of 1861, just after the\r\nfirst great defeat of the Union arms, \"That this war is not waged upon\r\nour part in any spirit of oppression, nor for any purpose of conquest\r\nor subjugation, nor purpose of overthrowing or interfering with the\r\nrights or established institutions of the Southern States, but to\r\ndefend and maintain the supremacy of the Constitution, and to preserve\r\nthe Union, with all the dignity, equality, and rights of the several\r\nStates unimpaired.\" And it was upon the basis of this understanding\r\nthat the Democrats in Congress, Mr. Johnson among them, stood with the\r\nRepublicans in the prosecution of the war. It is indeed a serious\r\nquestion of political casuistry as to how far declarations of policy\r\nare binding upon a political party. They are certainly not like\r\nagreements entered into between sovereign states, and the law of\r\ndevelopment rather than the law of contract must be the constructive\r\nforce in party creed. But this, at least, must be held, viz., that a\r\nman originally not of a given political party, but acting with it upon\r\nthe basis of a given creed, cannot be accused of being an apostate from\r\nthat party if he does not continue with it when it adopts a new creed\r\nin many respects the very opposite of that given creed, except in the\r\nmost groveling sense of machine politics; and that when he and it do\r\npart company, more by its own departures from the given creed than by\r\nhis, he is certainly not on that account to be necessarily considered\r\nas a traitor to his country. The truth is, that while all men who\r\noccupy high station are {221} peculiarly subject to wanton, as well as\r\nignorant, assaults upon their purposes and their conduct, few men that\r\nhave occupied so high a station have ever been so unreasonably\r\nslandered and vilified as Andrew Johnson. His own unfortunate and\r\nirritating manners and methods will account for a good deal of the\r\nmisunderstanding of his character, but the violence of the times was\r\nthe occasion of a great deal more of it. The true Union men of\r\nTennessee will, however, never forget the hope, and encouragement, and\r\nsupport which he gave to them, when they were left in the lurch by\r\ntheir own natural leader, John Bell; and the Nation should for this, if\r\nnothing else, write his name in the book of its heroes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{222}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT GRANT AND RECONSTRUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Situation at the Moment of Grant's Accession to Power--The Georgia\r\nQuestion--The Attitude of the New President toward Reconstruction--The\r\nVirginia Case--Grant's Message to Congress of April 7th, 1869, and His\r\nProclamation of May 14th--Ratification of the Virginia Constitution and\r\nElection of \"State\" Officers under it--The Restoration of Virginia to\r\nHer Federal Relations--Ratification of the Mississippi Constitution and\r\nElection of \"State\" Officers and Legislative Members under it--The\r\nRestoration of Mississippi to Her Federal Relations--Ratification of\r\nthe Texas Constitution and Election of \"State\" Officers and Legislative\r\nMembers under it--Restoration of Texas to Her Federal Relations--Grant\r\nand the Tenure-of-Office Act--Congress and the Tenure-of-Office Act\r\nafter Grant's Accession to the Presidency--The Modification of the\r\nTenure-of-Office Act--The President's Dissatisfaction with the\r\nMeasure--The Facts in the Georgia Case--New Conditions Imposed on\r\nGeorgia--The Final Restoration of Georgia to Her Federal\r\nRelations--Negro Rule in the South from the Point of View of Political\r\nScience and Ethnical Principle.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The situation at the moment of Grant's accession to power.]\r\n\r\nAt the moment of Grant's accession to power, four of the Southern\r\ncommunities were still denied recognition as \"States\" upon the floor of\r\nCongress. Three of the four had not yet adopted \"State\" constitutions,\r\nviz.: Virginia, Mississippi and Texas; and the fourth, Georgia, the\r\nrepresentatives from which to the lower House of Congress had been\r\nadmitted in December of 1868, was still unrepresented in the Senate,\r\nfor the reason that the legislature of Georgia, after electing United\r\nStates Senators, {223} had rejected the negro members-elect of that\r\nbody on the ground that negroes were not eligible to legislative seats\r\nin Georgia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Georgia question.]\r\n\r\nWhen the news of this procedure reached Washington, the Senate held\r\nback from admitting the Senators-elect from Georgia to seats and did\r\nnot admit them during the last session of the Fortieth Congress; and at\r\nthe opening of the Forty-first Congress, on March 4th, 1869, the day of\r\nGrant's inauguration, one of the first acts of the respective Houses\r\nwas to refuse admittance to the representatives from Georgia to _either\r\nHouse_, and to refer their credentials to the Committee of each House\r\non Elections.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The attitude of the new President toward Reconstruction.]\r\n\r\nIn his inaugural Address the new President made no reference to these\r\nquestions, but he had hardly been one month in the presidential office\r\nbefore he recognized the difficulties with which his predecessor had\r\nbeen beset, and asked and almost demanded of Congress relief from them.\r\nOn the 7th day of April he addressed a message to Congress requesting\r\nthat body to provide for submitting to the voters of Virginia the\r\n\"State\" constitution drafted and adopted by a constitutional convention\r\nat Richmond nearly a year before, and recommending that \"a separate\r\nvote be taken upon such parts as might be thought expedient,\" and that\r\nthe constitution, \"_or such parts thereof as shall have been adopted by\r\nthe people,_\" should be submitted to Congress on the first Monday of\r\nthe following December, and that the officers provided for under the\r\nsaid constitution should be chosen at the same election.\r\n\r\nThe President also suggested that the constitution framed by the\r\nconvention in Mississippi and rejected by the voters might be\r\nresubmitted in the same way. The events in Mississippi culminating in\r\nthe rejection {224} of the proposed State constitution by the voters in\r\nJune of 1868 have been already related.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Virginia case.]\r\n\r\nThe case of Virginia, on the other hand, which differed in several\r\nmaterial respects from that of any of the others, has not been as yet\r\nsufficiently stated for a clear understanding of the President's\r\nmeaning in his recommendations to Congress of April 7th. It will be\r\nremembered that a loyal government of Virginia, with its seat first at\r\nWheeling and then at Alexandria, existed during the entire period of\r\nthe Civil War, and that from 1861 to 1864 Virginia, under this\r\ngovernment, had been represented in Congress, and that it was this\r\ngovernment which consented to the partition of Virginia recognized by\r\nCongress. On the 23d day of May, 1865, this government transferred\r\nitself from Alexandria to Richmond, having been recognized by President\r\nJohnson on May 9th as the true government of Virginia. The legislative\r\ndepartment of it met in session on the 20th of June following. The\r\nGovernor, Mr. Pierpont, recommended, in his message to that body, that\r\na constitutional amendment should be drafted, and proposed by it to the\r\nvoters for ratification, which would enfranchise, and qualify for\r\noffice, a much larger proportion of the people than was the case under\r\nthe revised constitution of Virginia of 1864, adopted by the loyal\r\nconvention at Alexandria. The legislature followed the Governor's\r\nadvice and proposed an amendment to the voters which granted suffrage\r\nand eligibility substantially to the old ante-bellum electorate and\r\neligibles on the condition of future loyalty to the United States. This\r\nproposition was voted on at the elections held on the 12th of October\r\nfor the choice of members of the legislature and of the lower House of\r\nCongress, and was ratified by a large majority. The election was held\r\nin every county and the result was fairly {225} representative of the\r\npeople. There was lacking but one thing more for the complete\r\nrestoration of the \"State\" to its federal relations, viz., the\r\nadmission of the Senators and Representatives from it to seats in\r\nCongress. They presented themselves at the opening of the Congressional\r\nsession on the first Monday of December following, and were excluded,\r\nalong with the Senators and Representatives from the other \"Johnson\r\nStates,\" by the Stevens resolution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Vagrant Act.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General Terry's order setting aside the Vagrant Act.]\r\n\r\nFor more than a year, however, this government continued to act as the\r\n\"State\" government of Virginia, under the limitations placed upon it by\r\nthe presence of the military of the United States, and the interference\r\nof the commanding general in behalf of the freedmen. On January 15th,\r\n1866, the legislature chosen at the October elections of the preceding\r\nyear passed the vagrant act, which defined as vagrants \"all persons\r\nwho, not having wherewith to maintain themselves and their families,\r\nlive idly and without employment, and refuse to work for the usual and\r\ncommon wages given to the laborers in the like work in the place where\r\nthey are,\" and which authorized the condemned vagrant to be hired out,\r\nand his wages applied to his own use or the use of his family, and, in\r\ncase of his running away from the hirer, to be apprehended on the\r\nwarrant of a justice and returned to the hirer, who should have one\r\nmonth of service extra, and without wages, for the interruption of the\r\nservice contracted for, and other trouble and expense, and should also\r\nhave the right, by permission of the justice, to work the returned\r\nvagrant with ball and chain, in order to prevent a repetition of his\r\nflight. On the 24th, just nine days after the passage of the act,\r\nGeneral Terry, the military commander at Richmond, issued an order\r\nsetting aside this measure as to the freedmen. He based his order on\r\nthe {226} tendency of the statute to influence employers to combine for\r\nthe purpose of lowering the wages of the freedmen to a point that would\r\npauperize them and drive them into vagrancy, and create thus the very\r\nsituation which, under the operation of the measure, would lead to a\r\nspecies of servitude worse than the old domestic slavery. He had no\r\nreliable facts of experience upon which to base his theory. It was a\r\nbit of political and economic prophecy on his part. It was sufficient,\r\nhowever, to call down maledictions from the Congress at Washington and\r\nthe people of the North upon the legislature at Richmond and the people\r\nof Virginia and of the South generally.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Virginia made a Military District.]\r\n\r\nCongress, however, gave this legislature one more opportunity to redeem\r\nitself. The proposed Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States was submitted to it for ratification in June of 1866.\r\nAfter long deliberation upon it, the legislature rejected it on the 9th\r\nof January, 1867. This act sealed the fate of that legislature.\r\nVirginia was brought, with the other Southern communities which had\r\nrejected or not adopted the proposed Amendment, under the\r\nReconstruction Acts of March, 1867, and became the first military\r\ndistrict under those Acts, with General Schofield as commander.\r\nSchofield ordered the election for delegates to a constitutional\r\nconvention, by the voters designated in the Reconstruction Acts, to be\r\nheld in November of 1867, and ordered the delegates so elected to\r\nassemble in Richmond on the 3d of the following December. These orders\r\nwere successfully executed under the supervision and control of the\r\nmilitary. Schofield himself appeared in the convention, and urged the\r\ndelegates to be moderate in the propositions for the disfranchisement\r\nand disqualification of those who had participated in rebellion. But\r\nthe delegates {227} elected under the Reconstruction Acts, and by the\r\nelectorate created through them, were not only radical, but bent upon\r\nretaliation. They would not listen to the wise counsel of Schofield,\r\nbut drafted and adopted such provisions in regard to suffrage\r\nqualifications and eligibility to office and mandate as would have put\r\nthe \"State\" government, based on such a constitution, in the hands of\r\nnegroes, \"scalawags\" and \"carpet-bag\" adventurers. The opposition to\r\nthese provisions on the part of the commander and the Administration at\r\nWashington was, however, sufficiently effective to delay indefinitely\r\nthe submission of the constitution to the voters. Near the end of the\r\nyear 1868, a conference of prominent Virginians assembled at Richmond\r\nand appointed a committee, and sent its members to Washington to\r\npetition Congress to allow the disfranchising and disqualifying\r\nclauses, and the clauses in reference to county organization, to be\r\nvoted on separately from the other parts of the proposed constitution.\r\nThis committee proceeded to Washington in January of 1869, and argued\r\ntheir case before committees of both of the Houses of Congress, and\r\nalso presented the same to the new President-elect, General Grant.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Grant's message to Congress of April 7th, 1869, and his\r\nproclamation of May 14th.]\r\n\r\nIt was in consequence of such representations and prayers, that\r\nPresident Grant sent his message of April 7th to Congress, requesting\r\nauthority to accede to the petition of the Virginians, and that\r\nCongress immediately conferred the authority upon him. Armed with this\r\nauthority, the President issued a proclamation on the 14th day of May,\r\n1869, commanding the \"State\" constitution framed for Virginia by the\r\nconvention which assembled on December 3d, 1867, at Richmond, to be\r\nsubmitted to the voters, on July 6th, 1869, for ratification or\r\nrejection, and also commanding that those {228} provisions\r\ndisqualifying persons from voting and holding office who had in any way\r\naided the rebellion against the United States should be separately\r\nsubmitted.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ratification of the Virginia Constitution.]\r\n\r\nAt the election ordered by the President, the constitution without\r\nthese clauses was ratified, and the conservative Republican candidates\r\nfor office and legislative membership were elected.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The restoration of Virginia to her Federal relations.]\r\n\r\nAt the next session of Congress, in December of 1869, the Senators and\r\nRepresentatives presented themselves for admission. Their claims were\r\nsustained by the President, who reported to Congress that Virginia had\r\nfulfilled all of the conditions required of her for readmission to her\r\nfull privileges as a member of the Union, having among other things\r\nratified by legislative acts both the Fourteenth and Fifteenth\r\nAmendments to the Constitution of the United States, and urged the\r\nadmission of the Senators and Representatives from the \"State\" to\r\nCongress. After a good deal of discussion and some wrangling, the bill\r\nfor the accomplishment of this object was passed, and, in the last days\r\nof January of 1870, Virginia was restored to her proper federal\r\nrelations, on the conditions that the constitution of the \"State\"\r\nshould never be so amended as to deprive any person enfranchised\r\ntherein of the suffrage, or any citizen or class of citizens of the\r\nUnited States of the educational rights and privileges provided\r\ntherein, or any citizen of the United States of the equal right to hold\r\noffice, on account of race, color or previous condition of servitude,\r\nor of the school rights provided in the constitution of the \"State.\"\r\nThe Congressional Act also undertook to purge the new \"State\"\r\nlegislature by requiring that every member must take an oath that he\r\nwas not disqualified by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of\r\nthe United States, or that, if he had been, he had also been {229}\r\nrelieved by the Congressional Act authorized for the case in the\r\nAmendment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ratification of the Mississippi constitution.]\r\n\r\nThe Act of Congress of April 10th empowered the President to deal with\r\nthe question of Reconstruction in Mississippi in the same manner as in\r\nVirginia. By virtue of this power, the President issued a proclamation,\r\non the 13th of July, 1869, commanding the resubmission to the voters of\r\nthe constitution adopted by the Mississippi convention, on the 15th of\r\nMay, 1868, and rejected by the voters as stated on a previous page, and\r\ndesignating the 30th day of November, 1869, as the date of the\r\nelection. As in the case of Virginia, the President ordered a separate\r\nvote to be taken upon the disfranchising and disqualifying clauses of\r\nthe constitution which prohibited any person from voting or holding\r\noffice who had given any aid or comfort to persons in rebellion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The restoration of Mississippi to her Federal relations.]\r\n\r\nThe result of the vote on the constitution was the same as in Virginia.\r\nThe constitution was ratified without these clauses; and on the 23d of\r\nFebruary, 1870, the bill for the restoration of Mississippi and the\r\nadmission of the Senators and Representatives from the \"State\" to\r\nCongress, on the same conditions as those exacted of Virginia, became\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ratification of the Texas Constitution.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Restoration of Texas to her Federal relations.]\r\n\r\nThe Act of April 10th, 1869, also invested the President with the power\r\nof ordering the submission of the constitution framed and adopted by\r\nthe convention at Austin, Texas, in June of 1868, to the voters for\r\nratification. By virtue of this authority, the President ordered a vote\r\nto be taken upon this instrument on the 30th day of November, 1869.\r\nThis proposed constitution did not contain any such disfranchising and\r\ndisqualifying clauses as those which rendered the Virginia and\r\nMississippi instruments {230} obnoxious to the intelligence of these\r\ncommunities, and the vote was, therefore, ordered to be taken upon the\r\nentire constitution at once. The result was ratification; and on the\r\n30th of March, 1870, the Congressional measure for the complete\r\nrestoration of Texas to her proper federal relations, upon the same\r\nfundamental conditions as those required of Virginia and Mississippi,\r\nbecame law.\r\n\r\nThus while the new President did not, as his predecessor had done,\r\ndispute the power of Congress to direct and control the reconstruction\r\nof the disrupted Southern communities as \"States\" of the Union, he\r\nappealed to Congress for the authority to relieve some of them still\r\nsuffering under military rule from the hard alternative of negro\r\ndomination, and when Congress gave him the power requested, he used it\r\nfor the amelioration of the situation. This was true statesmanship. If\r\nPresident Johnson had done this instead of insisting upon his\r\nconstitutional power to reconstruct, independently of Congress, these\r\ncommunities, and repeating continually his unsound, though specious,\r\narguments in support of his view, it is quite possible that he might\r\nhave maintained his influence, in some degree at least, with the\r\nRepublican majority, and at the same time, and in consequence thereof,\r\nmight have accomplished something in the interest of a true\r\nconservatism in Reconstruction. This is not, however, certain. Johnson\r\nhad none of Grant's vast popularity with the people of the North\r\nwhereby to overawe Congress, and there is no doubt, deny it as we may\r\nto conscious reflection, that down below consciousness there was a sort\r\nof distrust of a Southern Union man on the part of a large portion of\r\nthe people of the North. Mr. Johnson had to suffer under the influence\r\nof this feeling, like all others of his class, and whenever he\r\nsuggested any moderate {231} course in the treatment of former rebels,\r\nhe fell under the suspicion of masking sympathy with their sentiments\r\nunder a pretence of Unionism. He was, thus, rather an object of\r\nCongressional distrust from the first, and could probably never have\r\ndone so much as Grant succeeded in doing for conservatism in Virginia\r\nand Mississippi, even though he had recognized the power of Congress in\r\nthe work of reconstruction, and had preferred respectful requests,\r\ninstead of asserting presidential prerogatives.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Grant and the Tenure-of-Office Act.]\r\n\r\nLikewise the new President found, as soon as he began the work of\r\nadministration, that the Tenure-of-Office Act was an unendurable\r\nhindrance to the efficient discharge of his duties. None of Mr.\r\nJohnson's Secretaries, it is true, gave him any trouble by attempting\r\nto hold on to office for the one month allowed them after the\r\nexpiration of Mr. Johnson's term. The men nominated by President Grant\r\nfor his Cabinet of chiefs and advisers were immediately confirmed, and,\r\nwith one exception, inducted into office. These men were E. B.\r\nWashburne, of Illinois, as Secretary of State; A. T. Stewart, of New\r\nYork, as Secretary of the Treasury; A. E. Borie, of Pennsylvania, as\r\nSecretary of the Navy; J. D. Cox, of Ohio, as Secretary of the\r\nInterior; E. R. Hoar, of Massachusetts, as Attorney-General; and J. A.\r\nJ. Creswell, of Maryland, as Postmaster-General. No immediate\r\nnomination was made for the Secretaryship of War, and General Schofield\r\nremained for a few days at the head of the Department. The President\r\nsoon found that Mr. Stewart, being a large importer of foreign goods,\r\nwas disqualified by statute from holding the office of Secretary of the\r\nTreasury. He first suggested to the Senate the removal of the\r\ndisability by a joint resolution of Congress, and, on objection being\r\nmade to the introduction of a {232} bill repealing the disqualifying\r\nstatute, he withdrew the suggestion. Mr. Stewart then relieved the\r\nsituation by sending in his declination, and the President nominated\r\nMr. G. S. Boutwell of Massachusetts for the office, which nomination\r\nwas immediately confirmed, and Mr. Boutwell took immediate charge of\r\nthe Department. Mr. Washburne, the Secretary of State, resigned the\r\noffice within a few days, and Mr. Hamilton Fish, of New York, was\r\nnominated and appointed to succeed him. General Schofield next resigned\r\nthe War Office, and was succeeded by General John A. Rawlins of\r\nIllinois. Finally, Mr. Borie resigned in June the Secretaryship of the\r\nNavy, and was succeeded by Mr. G. M. Robeson of New Jersey. The Senate\r\nput nothing in the way of these changes. But President Grant made up\r\nhis mind in a very few days after his inauguration not to have his\r\nhands tied in regard to any of the officers for whose acts he was\r\nresponsible. He gave the Republican leaders in Congress to understand\r\nthat he would allow the existing incumbents of the offices to remain in\r\noffice, unless they should commit some such offence as would call for\r\ntheir suspension, so long as the Tenure-of-Office Act should remain on\r\nthe statute book. The Republicans were hungry for a new distribution of\r\nthe spoils. They called it a righteous desire for the \"cleaning of the\r\nAugean stables.\" Whatever it was, they were thrown into a great state\r\nof trepidation by this covert threat of the President not to clear the\r\nway for their friends.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Congress and the Tenure-of-Office Act after Grant's\r\naccession to the presidency.]\r\n\r\nOn the 9th day of March, less than a week after the accession of the\r\nnew President to power, a bill was introduced into the House of\r\nRepresentatives providing for the immediate repeal of the\r\nTenure-of-Office Act, and was passed, immediately and without debate,\r\nby a vote of 138 to 16. These 16 were naturally Republicans. {233} The\r\nDemocrats voted for the repeal on principle. When the bill reached the\r\nSenate it was sent to the Judiciary Committee. This Committee quickly\r\nreported to the Senate a substitute for the bill of the House. This\r\nsubstitute provided that the Tenure-of-Office Act should be suspended\r\nfrom operation until the next session of Congress. No more shameless\r\npiece of partisanship was ever advanced on the floor of the Senate than\r\nthis. It simply meant, suspend the Act when the Republicans wanted to\r\nget the offices, and keep it in force when they might be in danger of\r\nbeing put out. The Senate itself could not be brought to vote this\r\nproposition of its Judiciary Committee. It was withdrawn by the\r\ncommittee, and Mr. Trumbull proposed to supersede the existing law with\r\na measure which would allow the President to suspend from office\r\nwithout assigning any cause for the same to the Senate, or even\r\nreporting the suspension to the Senate, and to nominate to the Senate a\r\nperson to fill the vacancy, and in case of rejection by the Senate to\r\nnominate another person; and only when the session of the Senate should\r\ncome to a close without a ratification should the suspended officer be\r\nrestored.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The modification of the Tenure-of-Office Act.]\r\n\r\nIt was pretty clear that the President would not find any trouble with\r\nsuch a measure as this, but it seemed to the House that the Senate was\r\ntrying to cling to a certain control over the Executive, and the House\r\nrefused concurrence in the bill. The matter was finally referred to a\r\nconference committee, and this committee speedily matured and reported\r\na measure, which allowed the President, during a recess of the Senate,\r\nto suspend any civil officer appointed by and with the consent of the\r\nSenate, except judges of the United States courts, until the end of the\r\nnext session of the Senate, and to designate some other person {234} to\r\ndischarge the duties of the vacant office in the meantime, and made it\r\nthe duty of the President simply to nominate to the Senate, within\r\nthirty days from the beginning of its next session, some one to succeed\r\nto the office permanently, and in case the Senate should refuse to\r\nratify the nomination, to nominate another person. Both Houses accepted\r\nthe recommendation of the Committee and the bill agreed upon by its\r\nmembers became law April 5, 1869.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The President's dissatisfaction with the measure.]\r\n\r\nStill the President was not satisfied with it. He thought that any\r\ncontrol whatever of the Senate over dismissal from office was not\r\nwarranted by the Constitution, and he regarded the attempt of the\r\nSenate to cling to any shadow of such a power as a personal affront to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nIn his first annual Message, that of December 6th, 1869, he earnestly\r\nrecommended the total repeal of the Tenure-of-Office Acts, and declared\r\nthem both unconstitutional, and inconsistent with \"a faithful and\r\nefficient administration of the Government.\" His recommendation was\r\nprobably an effective warning to Congress against any attempt to hamper\r\nhim by claiming any power under them to control his dismissals and\r\nsuspensions, but they still remained on the statute book for nearly two\r\ndecades longer. The glaring inconsistency of a bare and bald repeal of\r\nthe Acts was too great even for the partisan Congress. It was willing\r\nto make them practically null and void, but it wanted a shadow with\r\nwhich to cover its nakedness. At any rate, the position taken by\r\nPresident Grant toward them was a complete vindication of President\r\nJohnson's views concerning them, and, in no small degree, of his deeds\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nAt the date of this Message all of the Southern communities had\r\ncompleted the acts required by Congress {235} for their restoration as\r\n\"States\" of the Union, but the result of the elections held in\r\nMississippi were not known in Washington. The President simply\r\nexpressed the hope that the constitutions submitted in these\r\ncommunities to the voters would be ratified, and \"thus close the work\r\nof Reconstruction.\" As we have seen, the elections resulted as the\r\nPresident hoped, and these communities were restored, on the basis of\r\nthe \"State\" constitutions adopted, to their proper federal relations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The facts in the Georgia case.]\r\n\r\nThe case of Georgia still remained, however, unsettled, and the\r\nPresident suggested that Congress should enact a law authorizing the\r\nGovernor of Georgia, Mr. Bullock, \"to convene the members originally\r\nelected to the legislature, requiring each member to take the oath\r\nprescribed by the Reconstruction Acts, and none to be admitted who were\r\nineligible under the third clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\" The\r\nsituation was briefly as follows: The Senators and Representatives from\r\nGeorgia had been refused admission to seats in Congress at the first\r\nsession of the Forty-first Congress which convened the 4th of March,\r\n1869, because the legislature of Georgia had expelled the colored men\r\nelected to that body as ineligible, and had rejected the proposed\r\nFifteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. It is\r\ntrue that the Senators from Georgia had been elected by the legislature\r\nbefore the colored members were expelled, and that the Representatives\r\nhad been admitted to seats in the House during the last session of the\r\nFortieth Congress, and that the ostensible reason for not admitting the\r\nmembers to the lower House of the Forty-first Congress was that they\r\nhad not been elected to the Forty-first Congress. However, Georgia had\r\nno representation in either House of Congress at the date of President\r\nGrant's first annual Message in December of 1869. {236} Her \"State\"\r\ngovernment seems, therefore, to have been considered by Congress as\r\nbeing still only provisional, despite the fact that by the Act of June\r\n25th, 1868, she had been declared entitled to admission to\r\nrepresentation in Congress upon conditions which she had subsequently\r\nfulfilled.\r\n\r\nA bill had been introduced into Congress soon after the opening of the\r\nsession beginning March 4th, 1869, dealing with the subject. It was\r\nclaimed in the preamble of this bill that the Georgia legislature had\r\nnot purged itself of disloyal members as required by the Fourteenth\r\nAmendment to the Constitution of the United States, that it had\r\nviolated the constitution of Georgia and the Constitution of the United\r\nStates and the fundamental principles of the Reconstruction Acts by\r\nexpelling the negro members for ineligibility, and that the civil\r\nauthorities in the \"State\" could not, or did not, protect the loyal\r\ncitizens in the enjoyment of their rights and liberties or even in\r\ntheir persons. The bill proposed to meet these difficulties by\r\nproviding that the Governor of Georgia should reconvene the originally\r\nelected members of the legislature, reseat the expelled negro members,\r\nand expel such members as could not swear that they were not\r\ndisqualified by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States. It may be remarked here in passing that the Fourteenth\r\nAmendment does not disqualify anybody, in express language, from being\r\na member of a \"State\" legislature. It disqualifies all persons who have\r\nengaged in rebellion after having taken an oath, as a member of\r\nCongress or of a \"State\" legislature, or as a United States or a\r\n\"State\" officer, to support the Constitution of the United States, from\r\nholding a seat in Congress or from being an officer of the United\r\nStates or of a \"State,\" _but not from holding a seat in a \"State\"\r\nlegislature_. The word officer in the public {237} jurisprudence of\r\nthis country does not include membership in a legislative body. But to\r\nreturn to the bill. It provided finally for making United States troops\r\nin Georgia subject to the Governor's call for assistance. This bill was\r\nso seriously opposed by the Democrats and the conservative Republicans\r\nthat it did not pass, and during this session Congress did nothing\r\nfurther for the restoration of Georgia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The case of White and Clements.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the conservatives in Georgia undertook to do\r\nsomething for themselves. They got up a test case in the Supreme Court\r\nof the \"State\" to determine the rights of negroes to hold office. The\r\ncase was that of White and Clements, and the office involved was a\r\ncounty court clerkship. Of course the decision was not binding upon the\r\nlegislative houses in judging of the eligibility of their members, but\r\nit was thought that it would have an influence upon their views. The\r\ncourt decided that under the new constitution of Georgia and the code\r\nof Georgia negroes could hold office, since the constitution of 1868\r\ndeclared that all persons born or naturalized in the United States and\r\nresidents in Georgia were citizens of Georgia, and the code declared\r\nthat among the rights of citizens was the right to hold office. Of\r\ncourse the legislature could abolish or amend the code. After the\r\nrendering of this decision the conservative members of the legislature\r\nrequested the Governor, Mr. Bullock, who was a radical Republican, and\r\na New Yorker by birth, to reconvene the legislature for the purpose of\r\nreseating the expelled negro members. The Governor refused, apparently\r\nnot desiring to anticipate the action of Congress in the case. The\r\nattempt of the conservatives to help themselves thus came to naught,\r\nand the unhappy community drifted on toward anarchy and violence,\r\naccording to the report now made by {238} General Terry to the\r\nPresident, who declared it to be his opinion that the United States\r\nGovernment must intervene anew in order to preserve it against that\r\nfate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: New conditions imposed on Georgia.]\r\n\r\nIt was then with a good deal of irritation that Congress came to\r\nconsider the subject of Reconstruction in Georgia again in the session\r\nof 1869-70, and the determination soon became manifest to impose\r\nadditional and harder conditions upon this community than upon the\r\nothers. Moreover, as matters appeared at that juncture, the\r\nratification of the Fifteenth Amendment by the legislature of Georgia\r\nwould be necessary to make out the required three-fourths majority. It\r\nwas in this temper, and under the pressure of this supposed necessity,\r\nthat Congress, acting promptly upon the general suggestion in the\r\nPresident's Message, passed a bill which provided that the Governor of\r\nGeorgia should forthwith summon the persons declared by the\r\nproclamation of General Meade, of the date of June 25th, 1868, to be\r\nmembers-elect of the legislature, to assemble at Atlanta; that every\r\nsuch person should take an oath or affirmation that he had never, after\r\nhaving been a member of Congress or of a \"State\" legislature, or an\r\nofficer of the United States or of a \"State\" \"engaged in insurrection\r\nor rebellion against the United States, or given any aid or comfort to\r\nits enemies, or rendered, except in consequence of direct physical\r\ncompulsion, any support or aid to any insurrection, or rebellion\r\nagainst the United States, or held any office under, or given any\r\nsupport to, any government of any kind acting in hostility to the\r\nUnited States, or levying war against the United States,\" or should\r\nmake oath or affirmation that, if he had so acted, he had been relieved\r\nby Congress from any disability attaching to such act in the manner\r\nprovided in {239} the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution; that in\r\ncase any person claiming to be a member of the legislature should fail\r\nto make such an oath or affirmation he should be excluded from a seat\r\nin the body; that no member-elect should be excluded on account of\r\nrace, color or previous condition of servitude; that, on application of\r\nthe Governor, the President should employ the military power of the\r\nUnited States to enforce the provisions of the Act; and that the\r\nlegislature of Georgia should ratify the proposed Fifteenth Amendment\r\nto the Constitution of the United States before Senators and\r\nRepresentatives from Georgia should be admitted to seats in Congress.\r\nThis bill was approved by the President on the 22d of December, 1869.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Resumption of military government in Georgia.]\r\n\r\nSo great was the opposition to Reconstruction, under these hard\r\nconditions, on the part of the white people in Georgia, that the\r\nGovernor was obliged to call for the military of the United States to\r\naid him, and finally to step aside for General Terry, who by an order\r\nfrom the President, dated January 4th, 1870, was authorized to resume\r\nthe powers in Georgia of the commander of a military district, as\r\nprovided under the Reconstruction Act of March 2d, 1867. The General\r\nfound a number of members in the legislature recognized by General\r\nMeade's proclamation who could not take either of the oaths or\r\naffirmations prescribed. These he caused to be removed from their seats\r\nin very arbitrary ways. This procedure put the Republicans in the\r\nlegislature in majority, and they filled these vacancies by admitting\r\npersons who had received the next highest number of votes to those cast\r\nfor the expelled members in the election, and who could take one or the\r\nother of the oaths or affirmations prescribed in the Act of the 22d of\r\nDecember, 1869.\r\n\r\n{240} [Sidenote: Ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment by the Georgia\r\nlegislature.]\r\n\r\nThe legislature as thus reconstructed was approved by the military\r\nauthorities, and it now proceeded to fulfil the final condition\r\nrequired of Georgia, viz., the ratification of the proposed Fifteenth\r\nAmendment to the Constitution of the United States. It also ratified\r\nthe Fourteenth Amendment. This was, from a legal point of view,\r\nentirely superfluous, since the Fourteenth Amendment was, at the\r\nmoment, already a part of the Constitution, as much so as any other\r\nArticle, and in resuming the status of a \"State\" in the Union, Georgia\r\nwas, of course, subject to all parts of the Constitution alike. The\r\nlegislature might, with equal reason, have ratified specially any other\r\npart of the Constitution. The idea seems to have been to correct any\r\npossible defects in the ratification of this amendment which the\r\nGeorgia legislature had voted on July 21st, 1868.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Further delay in the admission of representatives from\r\nGeorgia.]\r\n\r\nThis purified legislature now elected United States Senators, both of\r\nthem Republicans, of course. All these things were done in the latter\r\npart of January and the early part of February of 1870, and as the\r\nCongress was in session, there was reason to expect that Georgia would\r\nbe, at once, fully restored as a \"State\" of the Union. A bill was\r\nreported in the House of Representatives on the 25th of February from\r\nthe Committee on Reconstruction for this purpose. It was nearly\r\nidentical in its provisions and language with the Virginia and\r\nMississippi bills, but it dragged along through nearly five months of\r\ndebate and partisan wrangling before it became law. The reason of this\r\ndelay was that, on March 4th, General Butler proposed an amendment to\r\nthe bill which provided: \"That the power granted by the constitution of\r\nGeorgia to the general assembly to change the time of holding\r\nelections, and prescribe the {241} day of meeting of the general\r\nassembly, shall not be so exercised as to postpone the election of the\r\nnext general assembly beyond the Tuesday after the first Monday in\r\nNovember in the year 1872, nor shall such power ever be by any future\r\nlegislature so exercised as to extend the term of any office beyond the\r\nregular period named in said constitution; and the said general\r\nassembly shall by joint resolution consent to this condition before\r\nthis Act shall take effect.\"\r\n\r\nThis language was at once taken to mean that Congress would undertake\r\nto empower the legislature of Georgia to extend the terms of the\r\nmembers of the Georgia legislature and of the Governor, elected in\r\nApril of 1868, by two years, on the ground that the \"State\" government\r\nof Georgia was still provisional, and would so remain until the passage\r\nof this Act, and that these terms would, therefore, not really begin\r\nuntil the passage of this Act. The conservative Republicans as well as\r\nthe Democrats repudiated this interpretation of the powers of Congress\r\nto extend, or to authorize the \"State\" legislature to extend, the terms\r\nof the members of the legislature and of \"State\" officers as an\r\nunprecedented usurpation. Some of them repudiated the idea that there\r\ncould be a provisional \"State\" government, and declared that any\r\nfurther legislation in regard to the reconstruction of Georgia was\r\nunnecessary, since the Act of June 25th, 1868, had restored Georgia to\r\nher position as a \"State\" of the Union, along with North Carolina,\r\nSouth Carolina, Louisiana, Alabama, and Florida, upon certain\r\nconditions, all of which Georgia had fulfilled, just as the others had\r\ndone, and since all the others had been admitted to the enjoyment of\r\nall of their rights and privileges as \"States\" of the Union without any\r\nfurther legislation than the Act of June 25th, 1868.\r\n\r\n{242} There is no doubt that the Butler amendment meant, and was\r\nintended by its author to mean, just what was charged by the\r\nconservatives. General Butler at last acknowledged and avowed it, and\r\nattempted to justify it. But he was unable to rally a majority to\r\nsustain it, and he withdrew it in the face of an amendment offered by\r\nMr. Bingham on the 7th, which provided that nothing contained in the\r\nbill should be construed either to vacate any of the \"State\" offices in\r\nGeorgia, or to extend the terms of the present holders of them beyond\r\nthe time provided in the \"State\" constitution, or deprive the people of\r\nGeorgia of the right under their \"State\" constitution of electing\r\nmembers of their legislature in the year 1870.\r\n\r\nThis amendment was passed on the 8th of March, and the bill as thus\r\namended was passed by the House of Representatives, and sent to the\r\nSenate on the same day. It was immediately referred to the Judiciary\r\nCommittee of that body and on the next day, the 9th, it was reported\r\nback to the Senate by this committee, without amendment. The Senate now\r\nconsidered it in committee of the whole from this time to April 19th,\r\nand when it was reported to the Senate it had been changed to a bill\r\nwhich declared the existing government of Georgia to be provisional and\r\nsubject to the provisions of the Reconstruction Acts of 1867; ordered\r\nan election in Georgia on the 15th day of November, 1870, for members\r\nof the \"State\" legislature as provided for in the \"State\" constitution\r\nof 1868; ordered the assembly of this legislature on the 13th of\r\nDecember, 1870, and its organization preparatory to the admission of\r\nthe \"State\" to representation in Congress; declared that the powers and\r\nfunctions of the members of the existing legislature should cease on\r\nthe 13th day of December, 1870; and made it the duty of the {243}\r\nPresident of the United States, in case of domestic violence in any\r\nmunicipality in the \"State,\" reported to him by the legislature or\r\nGovernor of the State, to suppress by military power such domestic\r\nviolence, and \"to exercise all such powers and inflict such punishments\r\nas may by the laws, or the rules and articles of war be exercised or\r\ninflicted in case of insurrection or invasion.\" The Senate concurred in\r\nthe recommendations of the committee of the whole, and added a\r\nprovision repealing that part of the Act of March 2d, 1867, which\r\nprohibited the organizing of any militia force in Georgia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The final restoration of Georgia to her Federal relations.]\r\n\r\nIn this form and with this content the bill was returned to the House.\r\nHere it was again debated, off and on, until June 24th, when it was\r\nfinally agreed upon with the following contents: \"That the State of\r\nGeorgia having complied with the Reconstruction Acts, and the\r\nFourteenth and Fifteenth Articles of Amendment to the Constitution of\r\nthe United States having been ratified in good faith by a legal\r\nlegislature of said State, it is hereby declared that the State of\r\nGeorgia is entitled to representation in the Congress of the United\r\nStates. But nothing in this act contained shall be construed to deprive\r\nthe people of Georgia of the right to an election for members of the\r\ngeneral assembly of said State, as provided for in the constitution\r\nthereof,\" and \"That so much of the Act of March 2d, 1867, as prohibits\r\nthe organization, arming, or calling into service of the militia forces\r\nin the States of Georgia, Mississippi, Texas and Virginia be, and the\r\nsame is, hereby repealed.\"\r\n\r\nThe Senate disagreed to the bill in this form and with these contents,\r\nand asked for a conference committee. The House agreed and appointed\r\nmembers. The conference committee agreed upon the bill as {244}\r\nperfected by the House with the addition to the second section of these\r\nwords: \"And nothing in this or any other Act of Congress shall be\r\nconstrued to affect the term to which any officer has been appointed or\r\nany member of the general assembly elected, as prescribed by the\r\nconstitution of the State of Georgia.\" Both the Senate and the House\r\naccepted and concurred in the recommendations of the committee, and the\r\nbill, as thus perfected, became law on the 15th day of July, 1870. This\r\nbill terminated the era of Reconstruction legislation by Congress, and\r\nat the next session of Congress, the session of 1870-71, the Senators\r\nand Representatives from Georgia were admitted to their seats, the\r\nSenate admitting those chosen to that body in July of 1868, Messrs.\r\nHill and Miller. The attempt of Governor Bullock to prolong the terms\r\nof the members of the legislature and of the officers of the \"State\"\r\ngovernment was decidedly disapproved of by President Grant's\r\nAdministration, and an election was held for members and county\r\nofficers and for Representatives in Congress in December of 1870. The\r\nwhite residents of the \"State\" stood well together, and carried the\r\nelection by a large majority against the Republicans. So soon as the\r\nresult was known Governor Bullock, whose term had still two more years\r\nto run, abandoned his office and left the \"State,\" and Georgia was thus\r\nearly rescued from negro domination, or rather \"carpet-bag\" domination\r\nthrough negro suffrage. Her harder experiences during the years from\r\n1868 to 1870 had worked out to her advantage, in that it brought the\r\nrespectable and capable portion of her white citizens together earlier\r\nthan was the case in the other reconstructed Commonwealths similarly\r\nsituated.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Negro rule in the South from the point of view of political\r\nscience and ethnical principle.]\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of a sound political science the imposition of\r\nuniversal negro suffrage upon the {245} Southern communities, in some\r\nof which the negroes were in large majority, was one of the\r\n\"blunder-crimes\" of the century. There is something natural in the\r\nsubordination of an inferior race to a superior race, even to the point\r\nof the enslavement of the inferior race, but there is nothing natural\r\nin the opposite. It is entirely unnatural, ruinous, and utterly\r\ndemoralizing and barbarizing to both races. It is difficult to believe\r\nthat the creation of such a relation between the blacks and whites of\r\nthe South was at all within the intentions of the framers of the\r\nReconstruction Acts. They were irritated because these communities\r\nwould not accord civil equality to the freedmen, would not accept the\r\nproposed Fourteenth Amendment, and had passed acts which created a new\r\nspecies of slavery or quasi-slavery of the blacks. They thought they\r\nwere placed between the alternative of continuing military government\r\nin the South indefinitely, or giving the negro the political power with\r\nwhich to maintain his civil rights.\r\n\r\nOpposition to military government in time of peace was an ingrained\r\nprinciple of the American people, and there was a large part of people\r\nof the North, nearly all adhering to the Republican party, who believed\r\nthat manhood suffrage was the true principle of a sound political\r\nscience. And it was thought that the only way of creating \"States\" in\r\nthe South which would sustain the Republican party was by giving the\r\nnegro the suffrage. It is not surprising, then, that they adopted the\r\ncourse which they did. There was a third alternative, as has already\r\nbeen pointed out, viz., the placing of these communities under\r\nTerritorial civil government and keeping them there until the spirit of\r\nloyalty to the Nation was established and the principle and practice of\r\ncivil equality among all citizens was made thoroughly secure. {246}\r\nBut, as has been said, the idea that these communities were \"States\" of\r\nthe Union, notwithstanding their rebellion against the United States\r\nand their attempted secession from the Union, seemed to prohibit the\r\nfollowing of this course, the only true and sound course. And so these\r\nunhappy communities were given over, as sham \"States\" of the Union, to\r\nthe rule of the ignorant and vicious part of their population, to be\r\nsustained therein by the military power of the Nation, under the excuse\r\nthat that part alone was loyal.\r\n\r\nA period of darkness now settled down upon these unhappy communities\r\nblacker and more hopeless than the worst experiences of the war. The\r\nconduct of the men who now appeared upon the scene as the creators of\r\nthe new South was so tyrannic, corrupt, mean and vulgar as to repel the\r\nhistorian from attempting any detailed account of their doings, and\r\nincline him to the vaguest outline. Moreover it is most difficult to\r\nfix upon reliable facts in this period of confusion and political\r\nnight, illuminated only by the lurid gleams of passion and hatred. It\r\nis best for the North, best for the South, best for the whole country,\r\nand best for the world that this terrible mistake of the North and this\r\nterrible degradation of the South should be dealt with briefly and\r\nimpersonally, and that lessons of warning should be drawn from these\r\nexperiences, instead of multiplying criminations and recriminations in\r\nregard to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{247}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\"CARPET-BAG\" AND NEGRO DOMINATION IN THE SOUTHERN STATES BETWEEN 1868\r\nAND 1876\r\n\r\nEscape of Virginia, Georgia and Texas from Negro Rule--North Carolina's\r\nRapid Recovery from Negro Rule--The Loyal League--Origin of the K.

In this they were wise. The army\r\nofficers did not, as a rule, sympathize with the radical {248}\r\nmovements of the Republicans in Congress, and they so executed the\r\nduties imposed upon them as to cause the least suffering and\r\ninconvenience. Their rule, though exercised under a repellent title,\r\nwas in fact far milder than, and far preferable to, the civil\r\ngovernment of the adventurer and the negro. They mingled socially with\r\nthe old families, and, in many cases, married their fair daughters. The\r\ncommon soldiers from the Northern \"States\" also fraternized with their\r\nrace relatives in the South. They did not fancy the black soldiers\r\neither of the regular army or the \"State\" militia, and many were the\r\ncases in which they intervened between the defenceless ex-Confederates\r\nand the brutal blacks in blue. It is even said by men who have every\r\nopportunity to know that many of them doffed their uniforms on election\r\nday, went to the polls, and voted the Democratic ticket.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the threats of Congress, and the ever-increasing conditions\r\nimposed by that body upon the permission to resume the \"State\" status,\r\nthese three communities held out under military rule until so many of\r\ntheir leading citizens had been amnestied by Congress and made again\r\neligible to office and mandate, and until so much better provisions\r\nconcerning the enfranchisement of the ex-Confederates had been secured,\r\nas to put them in a far better position to resume \"State\" government\r\nthan was the case two years before. Moreover, these communities had\r\nlarger white than black populations. After their full restoration,\r\nconsequently, Virginia and Georgia escaped largely the suffering\r\nexperienced by most of the others, and Texas also managed to pull\r\nthrough the years from 1870 to 1874 with only about a four-fold\r\nincrease of taxation, and the creation of a debt of only about\r\n5,000,000 of dollars, when she reached the period of union of almost\r\nall her best citizens in the {249} Democratic party, which, in the\r\nelection of Richard Coke as Governor in 1874, and of a majority of the\r\nlegislative members, permanently triumphed in Texas. Mississippi also\r\nhad held back in 1868 and 1869, as we have seen, in order to secure\r\nbetter terms for the ex-Confederates in the enfranchising and\r\ndisfranchising provisions of the \"State\" constitution, and by doing so\r\nhad accomplished this result. But Mississippi was one of the three\r\nSouthern communities in which the negro population far outnumbered the\r\nwhite. Mississippi was not, for this reason chiefly, so fortunate as\r\nVirginia, Texas and Georgia. She was obliged, with South Carolina and\r\nLouisiana, to pass through the fiery furnace in order to fuse the\r\nrespectable white elements in her population into a single political\r\nparty with a well-understood and a well-determined purpose.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: North Carolina's rapid recovery from negro rule.]\r\n\r\nOf all the \"States\" included in the Congressional Act of June 25th,\r\n1868, only North Carolina had been fortunate enough to rid herself,\r\nbefore 1872, of the rule of the adventurers and their ignorant negro\r\nsupport. This happened because matters were driven to a crisis sooner\r\nhere than elsewhere. The legislature of 1868 had proceeded promptly to\r\nauthorize the issue of $25,000,000 of bonds, when the whole taxable\r\nproperty of the \"State\" was not over $125,000,000. From the first\r\nmoment the people were threatened with confiscation, and when to this\r\nwas added the legislative act, known as the Schaffner law, authorizing\r\nthe Governor to suspend civil government, and institute martial law in\r\nany part of the \"State,\" and when he actually undertook to do so in\r\nthree counties of the \"State,\" the whites came together in the election\r\nof 1870, captured the legislature and redeemed the \"State\" from the\r\nhideous tyranny with which it was threatened.\r\n\r\n{250} [Sidenote: The Loyal League.]\r\n\r\nAlready before the Reconstruction Acts were passed, the political\r\nadventurers in the South had begun organizing the negroes into secret\r\nbodies, known later as the Union or Loyal League. The members of these\r\nbodies were sworn to obey the decisions of the organization and to\r\nexecute them. The original idea seems to have been a combination for\r\nprotection against bands of lawless white people, and for mutual aid\r\nand assistance in the hard struggle for existence to which the freedmen\r\nwere now exposed. The League soon took on, however, a political\r\ncharacter, and became a sort of Republican party organization in the\r\nSouth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Origin of the K. K. K.'s.]\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to determine whether the Ku-Klux organization preceded\r\nthat of the Loyal League and provoked it or not. So far as we know,\r\nboth of them were first heard of in the year 1866. It is probable that\r\nthe Ku-Klux had its origin a little farther north than the Loyal\r\nLeague. It is said by those who profess to know most about it, that the\r\nfirst appearance of this body was in one of the southern counties of\r\nTennessee, Giles County; that it was first organized by a lot of young\r\nloafers, probably ex-Confederate soldiers, who lived in the town of\r\nPulaski, the county town of that county; and that their first purpose\r\nwas the playing of practical jokes upon the ignorant and superstitious\r\nnegroes of the neighborhood. They operated in the night-time, went\r\ndisguised, travelled on horseback, their horses being also disguised,\r\nand were oath-bound to execute the decisions of the organization, and\r\nto protect each other. Whatever may have been its origin, this body\r\nalso soon found its political usefulness. It soon proved to be a\r\npowerful means for intimidating and terrorizing the negroes, and also\r\nwhite men acting with the negroes.\r\n\r\n{251} [Sidenote: Methods of the Ku-Klux.]\r\n\r\nAfter the Reconstruction Acts were passed and put into operation, and\r\nespecially after the Southern communities were reorganized as \"States\"\r\nunder them, and the military governments gave way to the \"State\"\r\ngovernments, this organization spread all over the South, and\r\ncontributed much by its violent and unlawful methods toward wringing\r\nfinally the new \"State\" governments of the South from the hands of the\r\nnegroes and the \"carpet-baggers.\" As it extended, its methods became\r\nmore lawless and violent. Its members whipped, plundered, burned,\r\nabducted, imprisoned, tortured and murdered, for the prime purpose of\r\nkeeping the negroes from exercising suffrage and holding office. They\r\nwere protected by many respectable people who would not have\r\nparticipated personally in their nefarious work. And they had\r\nconfederates everywhere, who, upon the witness stand and in the jury\r\nbox, would perjure themselves to prevent their conviction and\r\npunishment. It was even said that there were many cases where members\r\nof these Klans were able to have themselves subpoenaed as witnesses, or\r\nsummoned as jurors, in the trials of their comrades, and that they were\r\nsworn to perjure themselves, if necessary, to clear each other. The\r\nrespectable people of the South tried to make it appear that these\r\nlawless bands were simply freebooters, such as generally infest a\r\ncountry for a time after a period of war, and had no political meaning\r\nor purpose whatsoever; and it is probably true that the Klans never\r\nwent beyond county organization, any wider bond than the county\r\norganization, or Klan, being rather the moral bond of a common purpose;\r\nbut it cannot be well questioned now that they had one purpose at least\r\nin common, and that that was a chief purpose with them all, viz., to\r\nterrorize the negro out of the exercise of his {252} newly-granted\r\nprivileges of suffrage and office-holding, and keep him in his place as\r\na menial.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The naturalness of these organizations.]\r\n\r\nThe appearance of both the Loyal Leagues and the Ku-Klux Klans in the\r\nmanner in which they appeared, and at the time when they appeared,\r\nought not to cause any surprise to the student of history. Under the\r\nreconstruction of the Southern communities as pursued before March of\r\n1867 it seemed as if the freedmen were to be left to the tender mercies\r\nof their former masters, irritated against them by the act of the North\r\nin emancipating them, and by failure in war to prevent it. It was\r\nentirely natural, not to say praiseworthy, for them to combine for the\r\ndefence of their newly found rights, and for mutual assistance in the\r\nhard battle against want which they were now obliged to wage. And it\r\nwas no less natural that they should look for the intellectual power\r\nnecessary for forming such combinations to the white men from the North\r\nwho had helped them out of their bondage, and had given them food and\r\nclothes in their hunger and nakedness.\r\n\r\nAnd, again, when by the Reconstruction Acts and the restoration of\r\nmartial law in the South under them, Congress turned the tables upon\r\nthe Southern white people, and placed the ignorant barbarians in\r\npolitical control of them, and made every open attempt to resist this\r\ncontrol a penal offence, it was also rather natural, though not\r\npraiseworthy, that men should have bound themselves together by secret\r\noaths to do anything and everything in their power to defeat this\r\nblunder-crime against civilization. Whether natural or not, it always\r\nhappens when such attempts are made, and it is always to be expected.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The opportunity for political adventurers.]\r\n\r\nBut to return to the order of the narrative. The formation of the Union\r\nLeagues in 1867 and 1868 enabled {253} the negroes to vote in these\r\nyears for delegates to the constitutional conventions required under\r\nthe Reconstruction Acts, and to vote upon the ratification of the\r\nconstitutions framed by them, and to participate in the election for\r\nthe \"State\" officers and legislative members under those constitutions,\r\nwith the help and under the direction of these organizations, and to\r\noperate the newly established \"State\" governments under the same\r\ndirection. This opened the way for the \"carpet-bag\" governments in the\r\nSouthern \"States,\" whose deeds may be now briefly narrated.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Periods in the history of negro rule.]\r\n\r\nThe landing places in this story may be placed at the years 1872, 1874,\r\nand 1876. The year 1872 is the date of the national revolt against the\r\npolicy of the Washington government in the affairs of the reconstructed\r\n\"States.\" The year 1874 is the date when some of the reconstructed\r\n\"States\" succeeded in overthrowing carpet-bag and negro rule, and the\r\nDemocrats succeeded in electing a majority of members in the lower\r\nHouse of Congress. And the year 1876 is the date of the complete\r\noverthrow of that rule and the complete establishment of the \"solid\r\nSouth\" under white Democratic government.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Act for the enforcement of the new Amendments.]\r\n\r\nBefore all of the Southern communities had been admitted to\r\nrepresentation in Congress, and before any of them except Tennessee had\r\ngotten fairly under way with their new \"State\" governments, a bill was\r\npresented in Congress to provide for the enforcement of the Fourteenth\r\nand Fifteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States. It\r\nwill be remembered that these Amendments authorized the exercise of\r\npower by the United States Government against \"State\" action only. They\r\nread: \"No _State_ shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the\r\nprivileges or immunities of a citizen of {254} the United States; nor\r\nshall any _State_ deprive any person of life, liberty, or property,\r\nwithout due process of law; nor deny to any person within its\r\njurisdiction the equal protection of the laws\"; and \"the right of\r\ncitizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged\r\nby the United States or by any _State_ on account of race, color or\r\nprevious condition of servitude.\"\r\n\r\nIt is entirely clear from this language that, in the enforcement of\r\nthese new provisions of the Constitution, the United States Government\r\nmust direct its powers against the action of the \"States,\"\r\nrespectively, through their legislators and officials, and against that\r\nonly. But in this bill which became law on the 31st of May, 1870,\r\nCongress enacted penalties not only against \"State\" officers and agents\r\nfor the violation of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, but\r\nsevere penalties against any _person_ within the \"States,\" as well as\r\nthe Territories, who should undertake to deprive by unlawful means any\r\nother person of his right to qualify and vote at any election, and\r\nagainst any _person_ who under color of any law, statute or ordinance,\r\nregulation or custom, should undertake to deprive any other person of\r\nhis civil rights and civil equality. Congress also, in this Act, vested\r\nthe jurisdiction over such cases in the United States courts and\r\nauthorized the President of the United States to enforce their\r\ndecisions by the aid of the United States army and navy if necessary.\r\nNow, while it may probably be rightly claimed that the _Thirteenth_\r\nAmendment to the Constitution, which reads: \"Neither slavery nor\r\ninvoluntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the\r\nparty shall have been duly convicted, shall exist in the United States,\r\nor in any place subject to their jurisdiction,\" empowers Congress to\r\nmake laws protecting the civil rights and civil equality of persons\r\n{255} within the \"States\" against infringement by other _persons_, and\r\nto invest the officers of the United States, both judicial and\r\nexecutive, with the power to enforce these laws, since in this\r\nAmendment the prohibition of slavery or involuntary servitude is not\r\ndirected against \"State\" action solely, but against any attempt made by\r\nanybody to create an involuntary servitude, it cannot on the other hand\r\nbe claimed, with any show of correct interpretation, that the\r\n_Fourteenth_ Amendment warrants the exercise of any such power by the\r\nUnited States Government, and it is entirely out of the question to\r\nclaim that the Fifteenth Amendment protects the right of a person,\r\nwithin a State, to vote against the attempt of another person or of\r\nother persons to infringe the same, or even against the \"State\" itself\r\nto do so, except it be on account of race, color or previous condition\r\nof servitude.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Criticism of the Act.]\r\n\r\nThere is not the slightest doubt in the mind of any good constitutional\r\nlawyer, at the present time, that Congress overstepped its\r\nconstitutional powers in that part of the Enforcement Act of May 31st,\r\n1870, which related to the exercise of the suffrage, and trenched upon\r\nthe reserved powers of the \"States.\" The excuse for it was that lawless\r\nbands of white men, the Ku-Klux Klans and the like, were intimidating\r\nthe blacks, and in the approaching elections of the autumn of 1870\r\nwould prevent them from voting. But that was a matter for the \"State\"\r\ngovernments to look out for, and the \"State\" governments in the South\r\nwere, at the time of the passage of this Act, with the exception of\r\nTennessee, in the hands of the Republicans.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The corruption in the new \"State\" governments.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the new \"State\" governments had well begun their career of\r\ncorruption, shame and vulgarity. They were plundering the treasury,\r\nincreasing the taxes, selling franchises, issuing bonds, and\r\ncelebrating {256} high carnival everywhere and all the time. The\r\ngentlemen and political leaders of the old school, and the old\r\npolitical class, of the South looked on aghast, with mingled feelings\r\nof bitter degradation and anger, and the hotspurs and desperadoes were\r\nstirred to deeds of intimidation and violence. There is little doubt\r\nthat some negroes were terrified out of exercising the suffrage in the\r\nelection of 1870. Not yet, however, had enough of the disqualified\r\nwhites been amnestied, or enough intimidation been exercised, or\r\nsufficient unity among the whites been attained, to work the overthrow\r\nof \"carpet-bag,\" negro rule. Enough, however, was threatened to\r\ninfluence the Republican Congress to proceed to more complete, if not\r\nmore extreme, measures for the protection of the negro in his civil and\r\npolitical rights, and to move the President to garrison the principal\r\npoints in the Southern \"States\" with United States soldiers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The supplemental enforcement Act.]\r\n\r\nThe Congress passed the Act of the 28th of February, 1871, which so\r\nsupplemented the Act of May 31st, 1870, as to place the whole control\r\nof the registrations and elections when and where Representatives to\r\nCongress should be chosen, in the hands of United States officers, the\r\nsupervisors, and the deputy marshals, commissioners and judges of the\r\nUnited States courts. It may be claimed that Congress, under the power\r\nto regulate the manner of holding Congressional elections vested in it\r\nby Article I., section 4, of the Constitution, was authorized to pass\r\nthis law, provided it confined the action of it to the Congressional\r\nregistration and election. But since the \"State\" elections were held at\r\nthe same time and place, and under the same control and direction as\r\nthe Congressional, it was inevitable that the control of the United\r\nStates officers would be exercised, either directly {257} or\r\nindirectly, over those also. And this was unquestionably the chief\r\npurpose of the Act, so far as its execution in the Southern \"States\"\r\nwas concerned.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The President's Message of March 23d, 1871.]\r\n\r\nBut this was not yet enough in the views of the Administration. In the\r\ntwo years of his incumbency of the Presidential office, General Grant\r\nhad fallen into the arms of the radical Republicans, who appeared to be\r\nin large majority, and the usual manoeuvering had begun for the second\r\nterm. Upon the basis of information, which turned out to be very\r\ninsufficient and unreliable, the President, on the 23d of March, 1871,\r\naddressed a message to Congress, in which he affirmed that life and\r\nproperty were insecure in some of the \"States,\" and the carrying of the\r\nmails and the collection of the revenue dangerous; that the power to\r\ncorrect these evils was not possessed by the \"State\" governments; and\r\nthat it was doubtful if the Executive of the United States, under\r\nexisting laws, had the power to meet these exigencies; and asked\r\nCongress to pass such laws as would enable him to cope with the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Ku-Klux Act of April 20th, 1871.]\r\n\r\nCongress answered this appeal with the noted, not to say notorious,\r\nKu-Klux Act of April 20th, 1871, in which Congress simply threw to the\r\nwinds the constitutional distribution of powers between the \"States\"\r\nand the United States Government in respect to civil liberty, crime and\r\npunishment, and assumed to legislate freely and without limitation for\r\nthe preservation of civil and political rights within the \"States,\" and\r\nfor the punishment of the infraction of the same by individual persons\r\nconspiring together for that end, and for the punishment of the\r\nconspiracy alone, whether the infraction or the conspiracy was executed\r\nupon, or directed against, officers of the Government or merely private\r\npersons; and {258} in which the act of a combination of private\r\nindividuals defying successfully the constituted authorities of the\r\nUnited States in a given \"State,\" or those of the \"State\" concerned,\r\nwas declared to be rebellion against the United States, upon the\r\nhappening, and during the continuance, of which the President might\r\nsuspend the privileges of the writ of Habeas Corpus within such\r\ndistricts as he, by proclamation, might designate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The unconstitutionality of the Act.]\r\n\r\nThe first part of this Act was, unquestionably, an unconstitutional\r\nencroachment upon the powers of the \"States,\" in so far as it is\r\nrelated to the protection of political rights against infraction, or\r\nagainst conspiracy for the purpose of infraction, by private persons.\r\nThe second part was probably within the powers of Congress, but it was\r\na most extreme use of its powers. The \"State\" governments in the South\r\nwere in the hands of the Republican \"carpet-baggers\" and Republican\r\nnegroes, and there is no question that the governors and legislatures\r\nof these \"States\" were quick enough to call in the aid of United States\r\ntroops long before it was necessary to do so. Moreover, the militia of\r\nthese \"States\" was composed almost entirely of negroes, and the whites\r\nwere forbidden to keep arms. Under such circumstances this Act of\r\nCongress empowering the President to establish martial law upon his own\r\nmotion in time of peace within a \"State\" when combinations of private\r\npersons had successfully defied, in any instance, the laws of the\r\n\"State\" was a very stiff measure, and unwarranted by the facts of the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Interference of the United States military power in the\r\naffairs of South Carolina.]\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the Governor of South Carolina had asked the\r\nPresident to give him United States soldiers for the protection of the\r\n\"State\" and its citizens against domestic violence, and the President\r\nhad, on the 24th of March just preceding the passage of this act,\r\nissued his proclamation commanding the persons {259} composing the\r\nunlawful combinations to disperse and retire to their abodes within\r\ntwenty days. This was the method prescribed by the Constitution for\r\nbringing the military power of the United States to the assistance of a\r\n\"State\" government whenever the \"State\" government might not be able to\r\nmaintain itself against domestic violence. There is no doubt that\r\nGeneral Scott of Ohio, whilom officer in the Union army and in the\r\nFreedmen's Bureau, the \"carpet-bag,\" radical Republican Governor of\r\nSouth Carolina, attributed the most traitorous character possible to\r\nthese combinations, exaggerated the strength and extent of them to the\r\nhighest possible degree, and called for United States troops to\r\nsuppress them at the earliest possible moment. The most trustworthy men\r\nin South Carolina affirmed then, and have continued to affirm to this\r\nday, that those combinations had no traitorous intent whatsoever, but\r\nwere simply defensive in their nature; that the wholesale pardoning of\r\ncriminals by the Governor and the vagrancy of the negroes had filled\r\nthe country with desperadoes who made life, property, and female honor\r\ninsecure; and that, as the militia was composed of the friends of these\r\nfiends, and the \"State\" government itself would not protect the white\r\ncitizens, it was absolutely necessary for the white people to create\r\nsome means of united action in self-defence and take the law into their\r\nown hands. Statements to this effect were made by one Judge Carpenter,\r\na Republican \"State\" official of South Carolina, before the\r\ninvestigating committee of Congress in 1871.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The President's proclamation of May 3d, 1871.]\r\n\r\nOn the 3d day of May following the passage of the Ku-Klux Act, the\r\nPresident issued his general proclamation warning the people that the\r\nlaw applied to the whole country, but particularly exhorting the people\r\n{260} in the newly reconstructed \"States\" to suppress all unlawful\r\ncombinations by their own voluntary efforts, and declaring, that while\r\nhe was reluctant to make use of the extraordinary powers conferred on\r\nhim by the Act, he would nevertheless do so if it should be found\r\nnecessary for securing all the citizens of the United States in \"the\r\npeaceful enjoyment of the rights guaranteed to them by the Constitution\r\nand the laws.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The President's proclamation to the people of South\r\nCarolina.]\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of the following October, the President directed his\r\nproclamation to the people of South Carolina alone, declaring that\r\nhostile combinations of persons making armed resistance to the civil\r\nauthorities of the \"State\" and the United States, in their attempt to\r\nsecure the people in their rights guaranteed by the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States and the Congressional Act of April 20th, 1871, too strong\r\nto be overcome by these authorities, existed in the counties of York,\r\nMarion, Chester, Laurens, Newberry, Fairfield, Lancaster and\r\nChesterfield, and commanding the members of these combinations to\r\ndeliver their arms and accoutrements into the hands of the United\r\nStates officers in those districts, and disperse to their abodes within\r\nfive days.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Suspension of the privileges of the writ of Habeas Corpus by\r\nthe President in certain counties of South Carolina.]\r\n\r\nAt the end of the five days of grace, the President issued a third\r\nproclamation, declaring that the members of these unlawful combinations\r\nin the places mentioned in his former proclamation had not dispersed\r\nand had not delivered up their arms and accoutrements as ordered, and\r\nsuspending the privileges of the writ of Habeas Corpus in the counties\r\nof South Carolina above designated.\r\n\r\nOn the 3d day of the following November a fourth proclamation was\r\npublished, in which the President {261} acknowledged his error in\r\nincluding the county of Marion in the list of counties in which the\r\nprivileges of the writ were suspended, but declared that the situation\r\nin Union county was such as to warrant the suspension of those\r\nprivileges in that county also, and warned the insurgents in that\r\ncounty to deliver up their arms and accoutrements and disperse to their\r\nabodes within five days. This warning not having been obeyed, according\r\nto the views of the President, a final proclamation was issued by him\r\non the 10th day of November suspending the privileges of the writ of\r\nHabeas Corpus in Union county.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Ku-Klux trials.]\r\n\r\nIn execution of the Act of April 20th, and in pursuance of these\r\nproclamations, the President now sent a strong force of United States\r\ntroops into the district composed of the nine counties mentioned, the\r\ncommanders of which arrested some five or six hundred persons, kept\r\nthem in confinement so long as they pleased, and procured the\r\narraignment of some of them before the United States courts, where a\r\nnumber of them were convicted and sentenced to fine or imprisonment or\r\nto both. Whether there was any necessity for the exercise of such\r\nharshness as this is a grave question. It was felt at the South to be\r\nan abominable outrage, and the Democrats of the North held the same\r\nopinion. More ominous than all this, however, was the fact that many\r\nleading Republicans raised their voices in disapproval of it, and of\r\nthe law which authorized it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Corruption in the \"State\" governments of the South.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: In South Carolina.]\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1872, in addition to all this, there came to the\r\nknowledge of Congress and of the people of the North the frightful and\r\nscandalous corruption of the \"State\" governments in the South. It is\r\nvery difficult to get at distinct and reliable facts upon a subject\r\nwhich officials undertake to cover up and keep shrouded in darkness.\r\n{262} But the record of these doings in South Carolina was something as\r\nfollows. The House of Representatives, the majority of the members of\r\nwhich were negroes, and the presiding officer of which was the\r\nnotorious F. J. Moses, spent ninety-five thousand dollars to refurnish\r\nits assembly hall, where the aristocrats of South Carolina had never\r\nspent over five thousand. Clocks costing six hundred dollars each,\r\nsofas two hundred dollars each, chairs at sixty dollars each, desks at\r\na hundred and twenty-five dollars each, mirrors at six hundred dollars\r\neach, cuspidors at eight dollars each--such were the items of the bill.\r\nIn the four years from 1868 to 1872, two hundred thousand dollars were\r\nexpended for furniture for the legislative chambers alone. Then came\r\nthe bills of supplies, sundries and incidentals, amounting in one\r\nsession to three hundred and fifty thousand dollars, one hundred and\r\ntwenty-five thousand of it for a free restaurant, lunch counter and\r\nbar, at which the members and their friends fared most royally, eating,\r\ndrinking and smoking, and paying not a penny therefor directly, nor\r\nindirectly, since many, if not most, of the members of that legislature\r\npaid no stiver of the taxes. Then came the printing bills, averaging\r\nmore than one hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year where ten\r\nthousand dollars would have been more than enough to pay every\r\nlegitimate expense of that kind.\r\n\r\nThen came the sale of franchises of all kinds, and the pledging of the\r\ncredit of the \"State\" in the form of bonds to aid all sorts of\r\nenterprises pretended to be set on foot, or promoted as is now said, by\r\ncombinations of legislators or officials or their friends. In 1868 the\r\n\"State\" debt was about five millions of dollars, with almost enough\r\nassets to pay it. In 1872 the assets had disappeared and the debt was\r\nmore than eighteen {263} millions, and nothing worth mentioning to show\r\nfor it. And all this when the \"State\" taxes had been raised from less\r\nthan a half million of dollars a year on a valuation of over four\r\nhundred millions to two millions of dollars a year on a valuation of\r\nless than two hundred millions of property.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: In Louisiana.]\r\n\r\nIn Louisiana, under the leadership of the brilliant young adventurer,\r\nHenry C. Warmoth of Illinois, the financial history of the \"State\" was\r\neven more scandalous. During the four years of Warmoth's governorship,\r\nfrom 1868 to 1872, the average annual expenditure of the \"State\"\r\ngovernment was about six millions of dollars, when, measured by the\r\nprevious experiences of the \"State,\" six hundred thousand dollars would\r\nhave been ample to defray all legitimate expenses. At the beginning of\r\nWarmoth's administration the debt of the \"State\" was between six and\r\nseven millions of dollars, with more than enough assets to extinguish\r\nit. At the end of the four years of his power, in 1872, the debt was\r\nnearly fifty millions of dollars, the assets had all disappeared, and\r\nthere was nothing worth mentioning to show for the one or the other.\r\n\r\nIn the counties and municipalities of both \"States\" the corruption was\r\nequally rampant, shameless, and vulgar. It is impossible to obtain\r\nexact figures in regard to it, or to estimate with any degree of\r\nexactness, or even probability, the amounts stolen and made away with.\r\nIn the other reconstructed \"States\" where the adventurers and the\r\nnegroes held sway, the \"State\" governments worked along the same lines,\r\nthough not to the same appalling extent.\r\n\r\nIt was the most soul-sickening spectacle that Americans had ever been\r\ncalled upon to behold. Every principle of the old American polity was\r\nhere reversed. In place of government by the most intelligent and {264}\r\nvirtuous part of the people for the benefit of the governed, here was\r\ngovernment by the most ignorant and vicious part of the population for\r\nthe benefit, the vulgar, materialistic, brutal benefit of the governing\r\nset.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The revolt in the Republican party.]\r\n\r\nIt is no subject of surprise or wonder that, confronted with these\r\nfrightful results of radical Republican policy and administration in\r\nthe South, such Republicans as Horace Greeley, Charles Francis Adams,\r\nLyman Trumbull, David Davis, Carl Schurz, Gratz Brown, Stanley\r\nMatthews, George Hoadly, J. R. Spaulding, George W. Julian, Horace\r\nWhite, David A. Wells, and the like, turned with disgust from the\r\nnauseating transactions and resolved to do what was in their power to\r\nput an end to it all. Even the radical, but honest, Sumner gave his\r\nadherence to the movement for a change of the Administration, as the\r\nonly way to check the terrible corruption which was creeping over the\r\nland. Sumner, it is true, had been made to feel personally the heavy\r\nhand of the Administration. He had been dropped, the preceding year,\r\nfrom the chairmanship of the Committee on Foreign Relations at the\r\nrequirement of the Administration, because he had so strongly and\r\nsuccessfully opposed the Santo Domingo policy of the President and his\r\n\"aide-de-camp.\" But he had opposed that because he saw in it\r\ncorruption, robbery and bloodshed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Liberal Republican convention of 1872.]\r\n\r\nThe Liberal Republicans were bolters, of course, from the regular\r\norganization, and there was no sufficient opportunity for them to\r\nconstruct a party organization for themselves in time for the\r\nPresidential election of 1872. A general call for the leaders among\r\nthem to meet in mass convention was issued from a \"State\" convention of\r\nLiberal {265} Republicans in Missouri, and the meeting took place at\r\nCincinnati on the 1st day of May, 1872.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Their platform.]\r\n\r\nThe platform which it presented to the people demanded the removal, at\r\nonce, of all political disabilities from the white men of the South,\r\nthe maintenance of impartial suffrage and of equal civil rights, the\r\ncessation of military rule in the South and the supremacy of civil over\r\nmilitary power, the reform of the civil service, and a speedy return to\r\nspecie payments. Many of the Liberal Republicans were inclined toward a\r\nmuch more moderate tariff policy, but out of respect for the opinions\r\nof those among them who were strong protectionists, they abandoned\r\ntheir attempt to insert any doctrine on this subject in the platform.\r\nThe protectionists were equally considerate, and so the new party went\r\nto the country uncommitted upon this very important question.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Their nominees.]\r\n\r\nIt was at first supposed that the choice of the convention for the\r\nPresidency would lay between Judge David Davis of Illinois, Charles\r\nFrancis Adams of Massachusetts and Senator Lyman Trumbull of Illinois.\r\nBut an unexpected hostility of a very bitter nature soon developed\r\nbetween the supporters of Davis and Adams, and rendered the nomination\r\nof either of them impossible. This was evident on the first ballot, on\r\nwhich Mr. Greeley, Senator Trumbull and Gratz Brown each received more\r\nvotes than Judge Davis, and together more votes than Mr. Adams. It was\r\nthus manifest that the Western men would not take Mr. Adams and the\r\nEastern men would not take Judge Davis. The compromise was quickly made\r\nupon Greeley, and Gratz Brown was put with him upon the ticket. It was\r\nan unfortunate selection. The country did not want any brilliant\r\nexperiments at the moment. It wanted to settle down to business. And it\r\nwas to be {266} foreseen that it would not be willing to make a\r\nnewspaper man President at such a juncture.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Acceptance of the Liberal Republican candidates by the\r\nDemocrats.]\r\n\r\nBut stranger than the fact that the prince of protectionists was now\r\nrunning for the presidency on a platform which ignored protection, was\r\nthe fact that the Democratic party, strengthened again by its Southern\r\nwing, now accepted the platform of the Liberal Republicans, and in\r\nconvention at Baltimore, in July following the Cincinnati meeting,\r\nnominated the Liberal Republican candidates for the presidency and the\r\nvice-presidency as its own candidates. The action of the Democrats,\r\nboth as to the platform and the candidates, was almost unanimous, and\r\nit would be ungracious to express any suspicion of its sincerity. The\r\nchange of profession on the part of the Southern Democrats was very\r\ngreat indeed, so great as to be surprising, but they had evidently come\r\nto the conclusion that it was useless to contend with the North any\r\nlonger against the civil and political rights of the freedmen, and that\r\nit was best for all concerned to accept the inevitable, and try to put\r\nthemselves in the most advantageous position possible for adjusting the\r\nrelations of their section to it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Greeley and the Democrats.]\r\n\r\nMr. Greeley was, indeed, in strange company, but the company had come\r\nto him. He had not gone to them. He welcomed their support, and became\r\ncontaminated by it in the eyes of a vast majority of the people of the\r\nNorth. His own great ambition to be President also caused him to say\r\nand to do some imprudent and undignified things. More than all, the\r\ntime had not yet come for the great change. The country was fast\r\napproaching a financial crisis, and any shock would bring it on with\r\nsuch sudden violence as to make it widespread and disastrous.\r\n\r\n{267} [Sidenote: Division in the Democratic Party.]\r\n\r\nAs the last move, the \"straight-out\" Democrats bolted the ticket in\r\nSeptember, and at a convention held in Louisville, Kentucky, nominated\r\nCharles O'Conor of New York for President, and John Quincy Adams of\r\nMassachusetts for Vice-President.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Republican platform and nominees.]\r\n\r\nThe September and October elections in Vermont, Maine, Pennsylvania,\r\nOhio, and Indiana demonstrated the hopelessness of the opposition to\r\nthe radical Republicans. They had held their convention in Philadelphia\r\nin the early part of June, had issued a platform which simply asserted\r\nthe righteousness of what they had done and the determination to\r\npersist in the course heretofore followed, and had nominated General\r\nGrant for re-election to the presidency with Senator Henry Wilson, of\r\nMassachusetts, for his running mate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Republican triumph.]\r\n\r\nIn the election, they swept all of the Northern \"States\" by heavy\r\npopular majorities, and with their election machinery in the Southern\r\n\"States\" they captured a majority of these also. In those Southern\r\n\"States\" which were free from carpet-bag negro rule the Greeley\r\nelectors were chosen, that is in Maryland, Kentucky, Missouri,\r\nTennessee, Georgia and Texas. In the North, a very large number of\r\nDemocrats had failed to go to the polls. They could hardly have elected\r\nGreeley, however, had they all voted for him. They were pretty sure of\r\nthis, and they took the opportunity of administering a rebuke to their\r\nchiefs for not nominating candidates who were members of their own\r\nparty.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The effect of the triumph of the Republicans.]\r\n\r\nWhile there is no doubt that the re-election of General Grant, and the\r\nelection of a strong Republican majority in Congress, quieted the mind\r\nof the North, there is also no doubt that they caused great {268}\r\ndiscouragement among the white people of the South, since they operated\r\nas an encouragement to the adventurers and the negroes to persevere in\r\ntheir corrupt and conscienceless management of the \"State\" governments.\r\n\r\nIn several of the reconstructed \"States\" the Democrats had made strong\r\nefforts to secure control of the \"State\" governments. The Amnesty Act\r\nof May 22d, 1872, had removed the disqualifications of the Fourteenth\r\nAmendment from all the Southern leaders, except such as had been\r\nmembers of the Thirty-sixth and Thirty-seventh Congresses, or had held\r\njudicial, military, naval, or diplomatic office under the United\r\nStates, or had been heads of departments in ministerial office. A large\r\nnumber of these leaders had thus been placed in a position to\r\nparticipate as candidates for office and legislative position in the\r\nelection, and to aid greatly in the work of rescuing their \"States\"\r\nfrom negro Republican rule. In Alabama and Louisiana they had very\r\nnearly succeeded. In Alabama they had elected the Governor and a\r\nmajority of the members to the lower house of the legislature in the\r\nautumn of 1870, and in 1872 they claimed to have elected a majority of\r\nthe members to both houses.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Events in Alabama.]\r\n\r\nIn Alabama, the Democratic members-elect of the legislature convened in\r\nthe capitol, and the Republican members-elect in the court-house. The\r\nDemocratic Governor, Lindsay, recognized the Democratic legislature,\r\nand the Democratic legislature then canvassed the votes for Governor\r\nand declared the Republican candidate, D. P. Lewis, elected. Lewis then\r\nrecognized the Republican legislature, and telegraphed to Opelika for\r\nUnited States soldiers to come to Montgomery. They arrived by the next\r\ntrain, and, backed by these, the Governor and his friends, in and {269}\r\nout of the legislature, succeeded in constituting a legislature with a\r\nsmall Republican majority in both houses; and the whites fell back\r\nagain under black rule, discouraged and exhausted by the exertions and\r\nthe failure to escape from it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Events in Louisiana.]\r\n\r\nIn Louisiana the events were far more extraordinary and violent.\r\nWarmoth's rule was approaching its end, and his Republican enemies,\r\nwhat was known as the Custom House faction, the United States\r\nofficials, were fairly panting to get at him. To foil them, he went\r\nover to the Democrats and promised to give them a fair chance to elect\r\ntheir candidate for Governor and their candidates for the legislature.\r\nFor this he expected protection from them against the Custom House\r\ngang, to whom he had denied what they had conceived to be their proper\r\nshare of the public plunder, and who, if in possession of the \"State\"\r\ngovernment, would make him answer for it. Warmoth supposed he was able\r\nwith his election machinery to give the \"State\" to the Democrats\r\nwhether the voters should do so or not. The election took place at the\r\nsame time as the presidential election, November 4th, 1872. The returns\r\nwere sent by the supervisors and commissioners of elections to Warmoth,\r\nand he delivered them to his Returning Board, consisting of himself,\r\nthe Secretary of State, F. J. Herron, and one John Lynch; the other two\r\nmembers of the Board as constituted by the legislature, by the act of\r\n1870, viz., Lieutenant-Governor Pinchback and one Anderson, being\r\ndisqualified from serving, since both of them were candidates for\r\noffice at this election. The Governor had his suspicions aroused about\r\nthe loyalty of both Herron and Lynch to him before the count took\r\nplace, and having the legal power to remove Herron, he did so at once\r\nand appointed one John Wharton, a friend upon whom he could rely, in\r\n{270} Herron's place. Lynch now refused to act with them, and Herron\r\ndenied the power of the Governor to dismiss him from the Secretaryship\r\nof State, and from his _ex officio_ membership in the Returning Board.\r\nWarmoth and Wharton proceeded, however, to supply the place of Lynch,\r\nas they might do under the law, and Herron and Lynch proceeded to\r\nsupply the place of Warmoth.\r\n\r\nThe Warmoth Board had the returns, and it was also generally felt that\r\nthe Democratic candidate for Governor, John McEnery, had been chosen by\r\nthe voters. Moreover, the right of Herron to retain the office of\r\nSecretary of State was immediately brought before the supreme court of\r\nthe \"State,\" and the court gave its decision against Herron's\r\ncontention. It seemed now certain that the Warmoth Returning Board\r\nwould declare McEnery to have been elected Governor. But the Republican\r\ncandidate, W. P. Kellogg, then a Senator from Louisiana in Congress,\r\nwas watchful and resourceful. He secured from United States District\r\nJudge Durell an injunction which forbade the Warmoth Board to do\r\nanything except in the presence of the Lynch Board, and forbade McEnery\r\nfrom claiming his election under the returns which might be given out\r\nby the Warmoth Board.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Warmoth and Durell.]\r\n\r\nWarmoth met this by a move which was equally a _coup de surprise_. The\r\nlegislature had at its last session passed a law vesting the power to\r\nselect the members of the Returning Board in the senate. The Governor\r\nhad not signed this bill, and probably never intended to sign it, since\r\nit proposed to take the control of the Board out of his hands, but it\r\nnow seemed to furnish him a way of escape from Durell's order. He\r\nhastily signed the bill and promulgated it as law, and as the senate\r\nwas not in session, proceeded to appoint the members of the new Board\r\nhimself, under the power of the Governor to make temporary appointments\r\n{271} to office when the senate was not in session. He appointed one\r\nDr. Feriet chairman of the Board, and put the election returns in his\r\nhands. This Board declared that McEnery had been elected Governor and\r\nthat the Greeley electors had been chosen. The Governor published these\r\ndecisions officially on the 5th day of December, and the affair seemed\r\nto have been closed. But to the surprise of everyone concerned, and of\r\nthe whole country, in the middle of the night following, Judge Durell\r\nissued an order to the United States Marshal, S. B. Packard, to take\r\npossession of the capitol and hold it at the pleasure of the Judge\r\nagainst all unlawful bodies attempting to convene therein. The Judge\r\nclaimed that Warmoth had committed a contempt against his court in the\r\nReturning Board proceeding, and he declared that the Lynch Board was\r\nthe legal body. His order furthermore required the commander of the\r\nUnited States troops to furnish a detachment of soldiers to sustain the\r\nUnited States marshal in taking possession of the capitol, and in\r\nenforcing the Lynch Board's canvass and decision.\r\n\r\nA more palpable outrage upon the lawful powers of a \"State\" could\r\nhardly have been conceived. The Judge had not a scintilla of authority\r\nupon which to rest his proceeding. It is claimed that he was drunk when\r\nhe made the order. But this can hardly have been true, that is he could\r\nnot have been any more than ordinarily drunk, since the order was not\r\nwithdrawn when he became ostensibly sober again, but was made the basis\r\nof a proceeding which lasted through many days, and the results of\r\nwhich were the counting in of Kellogg and of a Republican legislature\r\nby the Lynch Board, the immediate instalment of the Lynch Board\r\nlegislature, the almost immediate impeachment of Warmoth by it and his\r\nremoval from the governorship, the installation of the {272}\r\nLieutenant-Governor, the negro Pinchback, in his seat, the recognition\r\nof the Lynch Board legislature and of Pinchback by the President of the\r\nUnited States as the lawful legislature and executive of Louisiana, and\r\nthe inauguration of Kellogg as Governor at the end of the\r\nWarmoth-Pinchback term. If this was all the work of a drunken spree, it\r\nmust have been a very long one, and there must have been many\r\nparticipants in it besides the Judge.\r\n\r\nThe Warmoth Board Governor and legislature undertook to set up\r\ngovernment also, sustained as they undoubtedly were both by the law,\r\nand by public opinion in Louisiana and probably throughout the country,\r\nand partially organized a militia force. It was the fighting between\r\nthis militia and the metropolitan police in the streets of New Orleans\r\nwhich occasioned the suppression of the McEnery government at last by\r\nUnited States soldiers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The downward course between 1872 and 1874.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The elections of 1874.]\r\n\r\nFor two years more now the government of the adventurers, based on\r\nnegro support, continued in the \"States\" south of the Tennessee line,\r\nexcept Georgia. Property was decreasing in amount and value; taxes were\r\nbeing doubled; and new bond issues were being made, and the bonds sold\r\nat a great reduction upon their face value, or stolen outright. But the\r\nday of deliverance was coming. The conscience of the Nation had been\r\naroused, and in the elections of 1874 the voters throughout the country\r\ndelivered a stunning rebuke to the party responsible for the hideous\r\nsituation in the South. It is true that other issues were influential\r\nin producing the _bouleversement_ of 1874, especially the financial\r\npanic of 1873 and the corruption in the circles of the Federal\r\nAdministration itself, the Whiskey ring frauds, and the Indian agent\r\npeculations. We must also {273} remember that at this very election\r\nseveral of the Southern \"States\" relieved themselves of Republican rule\r\nand sent solid, or almost solid, Democratic delegations to Congress.\r\nBut with all proper allowance for the effect of these things, there\r\nstill remained, as the chief cause of the change of view in the North,\r\nthe revolt of the popular conscience against being any longer dragooned\r\ninto the support of the policy of the Republican party in the Southern\r\n\"States,\" and the popular disgust at the everlasting \"waving of the\r\nbloody shirt\" whenever the dominance of that party seemed anywhere\r\nthreatened. At any rate, it was a clean sweep, and from a majority of\r\ntwo-thirds in the Forty-third Congress, the Republicans found\r\nthemselves in possession of only about one-third of the seats in the\r\nLower House of the Forty-fourth Congress.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The change in Alabama, Arkansas and Texas.]\r\n\r\nMoreover, three more of the Southern \"States\" freed themselves, at this\r\ntime, from \"Black Republican\" rule. In Alabama, the respectable whites\r\nhad now about all gone into the Democratic ranks, and with the election\r\nof George S. Houston as Governor, and a legislature in large majority\r\nDemocratic, the \"State\" won at last its self-government. Likewise by a\r\nsimilar fusion of all the respectable whites into the Democratic party,\r\nA. H. Garland was elected Governor of Arkansas and a legislature with a\r\nlarge Democratic majority was chosen, and from that time forward the\r\n\"State\" government has been in the hands of its own citizens. The same\r\nresult was reached in Texas, where the union of the respectables of all\r\nparties upon the Democratic candidates elected Richard Coke Governor\r\nand a legislature of reputable white men.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The status in South Carolina in 1874.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Governor Chamberlain.]\r\n\r\nEven South Carolina very nearly escaped her thraldom, and came near to\r\nelecting a white Democrat Governor. As it was, she got a moderate\r\nRepublican for {274} Governor, Mr. D. H. Chamberlain, a Northerner\r\nindeed, but a man of great ability and undoubted honesty, who did\r\neverything in his power to redeem the \"State\" from the miserable\r\ncondition into which the errors and crimes of his predecessors had\r\nbrought it. He naturally soon found himself in conflict with some of\r\nthe leaders of his own party in the \"State\" and at Washington, and was\r\ngreatly impeded by them in carrying out his own purposes. At last, in\r\n1875, the break between him and the members of his party in the\r\nlegislature was completed by the act of the legislature in electing the\r\nnotorious F. J. Moses, Jr., and the negro, W. J. Whipper, \"State\"\r\njudges. The Governor was so incensed at this act of downright depravity\r\nthat he refused to commission the two judges-elect to the judicial\r\noffices to which they had been chosen. Whipper threatened to use force\r\nto gain possession of the office, and the Governor issued his\r\nproclamation threatening to arrest every person who should give Whipper\r\nany aid or support in this attempt as disturbers of the public peace.\r\nThe Governor triumphed and protected the \"State\" against the terrible\r\ndegradation which impended over it, but his brave attitude ruined him\r\nwith the radical and base elements of his party.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The day of complete deliverance.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The status in Mississippi in 1875.]\r\n\r\nThe day of complete deliverance was now, however, rapidly approaching.\r\nThe election of 1875 in Mississippi showed that the domination of the\r\n\"Black Republicans\" in the Southern \"State\" governments could last no\r\nlonger. Here was a \"State\" in which the negro population exceeded the\r\nwhite very largely, but in the election of 1875 the whites finally got\r\ntogether and what they could not accomplish in one way they did in\r\nanother. The whites organized themselves into rifle clubs, attended the\r\nRepublican {275} meetings and insisted upon a division of the time\r\nbetween their own speakers and the Republican speakers at these\r\nmeetings. A great deal of fraud and intimidation was practised, and\r\nsome violence was exercised, but always in such a manner as not to\r\nprovoke the calling of United States troops to the scene. The immediate\r\noccasion of these desperate movements on the part of the whites was the\r\ntreatment accorded the petition made by the taxpayers' convention of\r\nthe \"State\" to the legislature for relief from the intolerable burdens\r\nunder which the taxpayers were suffering. This petition of the 4th of\r\nJanuary, 1875, recited that between the years 1869 and 1874 the rate of\r\n\"State\" taxation had been raised from ten cents on the hundred dollars\r\nof assessed value of lands to one dollar and forty cents, and that in\r\nmany cases the increase in the rate of the county levies had been even\r\ngreater, so that the whole product of the soil was hardly sufficient to\r\npay the taxes. The negro legislature laughed at these representations,\r\nand did not deign to consider them, much less to do anything to satisfy\r\nthe frightful grievances complained of. It was now a choice between\r\ncomplete destruction and the employment of any means necessary to\r\nescape from it. There was no use in talking about observing the letter\r\nof the law at such a moment. The law was iniquitous and it was rapidly\r\ndestroying all that was left of prosperity, civilization, morality and\r\ndecency. If it would not yield, it had to be broken. The movement was\r\nsuccessful. It was really a revolution. It resulted in the election of\r\na Democratic legislature in November of 1875, the disruption of the\r\nRepublican party in the \"State,\" the framing of an impeachment against\r\nthe Republican Governor, Ames, his resignation and departure from the\r\n\"State,\" and the accession of the {276} Democrat, John M. Stone, to the\r\ngubernatorial office.\r\n\r\nIt was thus that the eventful year 1876 was introduced, and it was an\r\nearnest of the relief which was now to come to the remaining \"States\"\r\nof the South suffering under the rule of the adventurers and their\r\nnegro allies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fiat money and the resumption of specie payments.]\r\n\r\nWhile the Republican party had step by step, and almost unconsciously,\r\ninvolved itself in the support of dishonest and oppressive government\r\nat the South, it was, on the other hand, fighting the battle for\r\nfinancial honesty in the Nation at large against the fiat money heresy\r\nand the schemes of repudiation invented and supported by the national\r\nDemocracy. Its Congressional majority had passed the Refunding Acts of\r\nJuly 14th, 1870, and January 20th, 1871, for refunding the debt of the\r\nUnited States in coin bonds bearing five, four and one-half and four\r\nper centum interest. These acts authorized the issue of eighteen\r\nhundred millions of dollars in these new bonds, five hundred millions\r\npayable after ten years, and bearing five per centum interest, three\r\nhundred millions payable after fifteen years and bearing four and\r\none-half per centum interest, and one thousand millions payable after\r\nthirty years and bearing four per centum interest. By the Act of March\r\n18th, 1869, the Republican Congress had declared that all of the\r\nobligations of the United States should be paid in coin or its\r\nequivalent, unless otherwise specifically stipulated in the law\r\nauthorizing the obligation. This Act was made applicable to past, as\r\nwell as future, obligations. It rested on the principle that debts must\r\nbe paid in the best money of the country unless otherwise agreed to in\r\nthe contract. This is, of course, the sound principle both of morals\r\nand finance, and no act of Congress pronouncing {277} it would have\r\nbeen considered necessary, except for the great fact that the\r\nDemocratic party, in its campaign of 1868, had espoused the opposite\r\ndoctrine and had fought the campaign largely under that issue. The Act,\r\nhowever, might of course be repealed, and in that case the question as\r\nto whether the principal sum of the greater part of the national\r\nindebtedness should be paid in coin would be again opened, since the\r\nlaws authorizing the incurring of these obligations provided only for\r\nthe payment of the interest upon them in coin. It was in order to\r\nforestall the possibility of a repeal of the Act of March 18th, 1869,\r\nas well as in order to make a large saving in the interest charge, that\r\nthese Refunding Acts were passed.\r\n\r\nAfter the panic of 1873 had resulted in such a depression of business\r\nand depreciation of values throughout the country as to create greater\r\ndiscontent with the existing political management, and this discontent\r\nhad manifested itself so distinctly in the elections of 1874,\r\nannouncing to the Republican party that after March 5th, 1875, a\r\nDemocratic majority would prevail in the House of Representatives, it\r\nwas manifest to the Republican leaders, in Congress and out of\r\nCongress, that if anything was to be done in regard to the resumption\r\nof specie payment, anything for bringing the paper currency of the\r\nUnited States up to a coin value, it must be done speedily, and on the\r\n21st of December, 1874, Mr. Sherman reported a bill from the Finance\r\nCommittee to the Senate for this purpose, which became a law on the\r\n14th day of January following, and which provided for the redemption of\r\nthe fractional currency with silver coins of the value of ten,\r\ntwenty-five and fifty cents, so rapidly as these coins could be minted;\r\nabolished the charge of one-fifth of one per centum on the coinage of\r\ngold, making the coinage of gold at the mints of the {278} United\r\nStates free; repealed the law limiting the aggregate amount of the\r\ncirculating notes of the national banking associations, and the law for\r\nthe withdrawal of national-bank currency from, and its redistribution\r\namong, the several \"States\" and Territories; ordered the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury in issuing new circulating notes to the national banking\r\nassociations to retire United States legal tender notes to the amount\r\nof eighty per centum of such issues, until the United States legal\r\ntender notes should be reduced to three hundred millions of dollars,\r\nand after January 1st, 1879, to redeem these legal tender notes in coin\r\non their presentation at the office of the Assistant Treasurer of the\r\nUnited States in the city of New York, in sums of not less than fifty\r\ndollars; and, to enable the Secretary of the Treasury to do this,\r\nauthorized him to use any unappropriated surplus revenue which might\r\nbe, from time to time, in the Treasury, and to sell bonds of the\r\ndescription mentioned in the Act of July 14th, 1870, in such amounts as\r\nhe should find necessary to accomplish the purpose.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The inflation bill of 1874 and the veto of it by the\r\nPresident.]\r\n\r\nIt is true that the Republican majority in Congress had not taken this\r\nhigh ground concerning the public credit and sound money without some\r\nwavering. The President himself had become frightened by the panic of\r\nthe autumn of 1873, and in his annual message of December 1st following\r\nhad made recommendations that might be regarded as favorable to an\r\ninflation of the existing body of paper money. His party friends in\r\nCongress very soon produced a bill which, among other things, provided\r\nfor the increase of the United States notes and the national bank notes\r\nto the extent of about one hundred millions of dollars, and passed it.\r\nBut the President had either thought the question out more fully, or\r\nhad been in receipt of some very sound {279} advice, after he wrote the\r\nmessage of December 1st, 1873. On the 22d of April, 1874, he sent a\r\nspecial message to Congress vetoing the bill. This stand of the\r\nPresident recalled the Republicans in Congress from their economic\r\naberrations, and set them again upon the course which led to the Act of\r\nthe 14th of January, 1875.\r\n\r\nWhile at the moment this law for the resumption of specie payments in\r\nthe short period of four years, or rather less, from the time of its\r\nenactment seemed a rather hazardous, not to say desperate, move on the\r\npart of the Republicans, it soon became manifest that they could have\r\ndone nothing so calculated to strengthen the hold of the party upon the\r\nsolid and conservative men of the country as just this very thing. Many\r\nof these men who had usually voted with the Republicans disapproved of\r\nthe Southern policy of the party, and were on the point of turning\r\nagainst it. With the Resumption Act the financial policy of the\r\nRepublican party, and of the country, was dragged to the front, and the\r\nSouthern policy was forced backward, and made to constitute a less\r\nprominent issue in the campaign of 1876. This was not only wise party\r\nmanagement, but it was also a fortunate thing for the entire country.\r\nThe country was not yet in a position to endure a Democratic\r\nadministration, and, on the other hand, it was surfeited with\r\nreconstruction Republican administrations. It wanted a sound money\r\nRepublican administration, which would devote itself to the development\r\nof the economic interests of the whole people, and would let the\r\n\"State\" governments in the South have a chance to work out their own\r\nsalvation. And this was just what it got in the election of 1876, and\r\nin the administration of President Rutherford B. Hayes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{280}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 1876 AND ITS CONSEQUENCES\r\n\r\nThe Republican National Convention of 1876--The Platform--The\r\nNominees--The National Democratic Convention of 1876--The Platform--The\r\nNominees--The Campaign and the Election--The Count and the\r\nTwenty-second Joint Rule--Views in Regard to the Power to Count the\r\nElectoral Vote--The Republicans in Advantage in the Count of the\r\nVote--The Electoral Commission Bill--The Passage of the Bill--The\r\nMembers of the Commission--The Fifth Justice--Justice David Davis--The\r\nCounting of the Electoral Vote by Congress--The Double Returns from\r\nSouth Carolina, Florida, Louisiana and Oregon--The Counsel before the\r\nCommission--The Republican Position--The Democratic Position--The\r\nDecisions of the Commission--Mr. Hayes Declared President--The Truth in\r\nRegard to the Election--Mr. Hayes's Southern Policy--The Result of His\r\nPolicy--Reconciliation between the North and the South.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Republican National Convention of 1876.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The platform.]\r\n\r\nWhen the managers of the Republican party met in National nominating\r\nconvention at Cincinnati, on the 14th of June, 1876, they rightly\r\ndivined the policy which alone could lead them to victory in the\r\nelections of the following autumn. They constructed their platform in\r\nsuch a way as to place the financial issue in the foreground, with the\r\npledges of the party to uphold the public credit, and to place the\r\ncurrency of the country on a coin basis. They also declared the\r\npacification of the South to be a sacred duty, and pledged the {281}\r\nparty to a thoroughgoing reform of the civil service. Connected\r\ntherewith were, of course, the usual platitudes about the civil and\r\npolitical liberty and equality of every American citizen and of\r\neverybody else.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The nominees.]\r\n\r\nWhile there was no name before the convention commanding universal\r\npopular assent, as had been the case at the second nomination of\r\nLincoln and the two nominations of Grant, still there was one which, in\r\nso far as its possessor was known, inspired strong, if not\r\nenthusiastic, confidence. It was not pronounced in the first balloting\r\nso loudly as that of the brilliant Blaine, or the stolid Morton, or the\r\narrogant Conkling, but, as the voting continued, more and more of the\r\nballots contained it, and at last on the seventh round, it received a\r\nmajority of the votes. The choice was a wise one. Mr. Hayes had been a\r\ngood soldier, a valuable member of the National legislature, and an\r\nexcellent Governor of his native \"State,\" in which office he was\r\nserving for a third term at the time of his nomination for the\r\nPresidency. He was a man of sound sense, unimpeachable character,\r\ngenerous feeling, pleasing manners, and resolute will. There was a\r\ntendency at first on the part of the friends of some of the\r\ndisappointed aspirants to belittle his qualities, and to represent him\r\nas a weak man, and his conciliatory methods were often mistaken for\r\nweakness by those who were not his rivals or his enemies, or the\r\nfriends of his rivals or his enemies; but as history sets his character\r\nand his work in their proper perspective they both stand out more and\r\nmore strongly, and make his Administration appear to be one of the most\r\nimportant in American annals. Especially does it honor him for his\r\nearnest, faithful and successful battle for sound money and the\r\nmaintenance of the public faith, and for his determination to put an\r\nend to the support by Federal {282} bayonets of the \"carpet-bag,\" negro\r\n\"State\" governments of the South.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The National Democratic Convention of 1876.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The platform.]\r\n\r\nA fortnight after the nomination by the Republican convention of\r\nRutherford B. Hayes for President and William A. Wheeler for\r\nVice-President, the Democratic leaders met at St. Louis for the purpose\r\nof issuing the campaign creed of their party and choosing its candidate\r\nfor the chief magistracy of the Nation. The platform put forward by\r\nthem was remarkable for its length, its language of fierce\r\nvituperation, and its loud calls for reform. Its specific propositions\r\nwere the reduction of the duties on foreign imports to a revenue basis,\r\nand the repeal of the Resumption Act of 1875, on the strange ground\r\nthat it obstructed the return to specie payments.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The nominees.]\r\n\r\nTheir candidate had virtually been determined on before they met. It\r\ncould be nobody else than the popular Governor of New York, Samuel J.\r\nTilden, shrewd in business, rich, the most successful political manager\r\nNew York had produced since Van Buren, greatly heralded as the very\r\narchpriest of reform, the hope of the young men in politics; but not a\r\nstatesman in the highest sense of the word, nor a demagogue in the\r\nlowest sense of that word--a genuine American politician of the first\r\norder. He was nominated on the second ballot, and by a unanimous vote.\r\nWith him was placed as candidate for the second place the popular Mr.\r\nHendricks of Indiana. It was a strong ticket, and it was generally\r\nbelieved that it would win. Mr. Tilden himself felt sure of the\r\nelectoral votes of all the Southern \"States\" and of New York, Indiana,\r\nNew Jersey and Connecticut.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The campaign and the election.]\r\n\r\nMr. Tilden quietly managed his own campaign, while Mr. Hayes left his\r\npolitical interests in the hands of the {283} very astute chairman of\r\nthe National committee of the Republican party, Senator Chandler of\r\nMichigan. There was not much doubt on the morning following the\r\nelection, the morning of the 8th November, that the Democrats had\r\ntriumphed. Almost all of the Republican newspapers conceded it. But the\r\nRepublican managers knew that they could do what they pleased with the\r\nelectoral votes of South Carolina, Florida and Louisiana, through their\r\ncanvassing boards in these \"States,\" with the power in these boards to\r\nthrow out the returns from any place where, in their opinion, there had\r\nbeen any violence, intimidation, fraud or bribery exercised or\r\nattempted; and when the managers found that they were pretty sure of\r\nthe electoral votes of all of the Northern Commonwealths, except\r\nConnecticut, New York, New Jersey and Indiana, they simply added to the\r\none hundred and sixty-six electoral votes of which they were\r\npractically sure the nineteen votes of Louisiana, Florida and South\r\nCarolina, of which they were absolutely sure, if needed, and sent out\r\nfrom their head-quarters the positive announcement that Hayes and\r\nWheeler had been elected by a majority of one electoral vote.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The count and the twenty-second joint rule.]\r\n\r\nBut the final count of the electoral vote must be in the presence of\r\nthe two Houses of Congress assembled in one place, and the Democrats\r\nwere in majority in one of the Houses, and the twenty-second joint\r\nrule, as it was called, which had been applied since the count of the\r\nelectoral vote of 1864 for the ascertainment of the result of the\r\nreturns to Congress, ordained that the electoral vote of any \"State\"\r\nmight be thrown out by either House. If this rule should be considered\r\nas still in force, and be applied in the impending count, the\r\nDemocratic House of Representatives could reject the returns of the\r\n{284} Republican authorities in South Carolina, Florida and Louisiana,\r\nand thus secure the election of Mr. Tilden. This rule, however, was not\r\nnecessarily binding upon this Congress, as it had not been re-enacted\r\nby the Houses composing it. That is, either House could lawfully refuse\r\nto acquiesce in its further application. The Republicans now repudiated\r\nit, although it was their predecessors who had created it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Views in regard to the power to count the electoral vote.]\r\n\r\nSome of the Republicans now claimed that the Constitution vested the\r\nVice-President, or rather the President of the Senate, with the power\r\nto count the electoral votes. The language of the Constitution was, and\r\nstill is, \"the President of the Senate shall, in the presence of the\r\nSenate and House of Representatives, open all the certificates and the\r\nvotes shall then be counted.\" No President of the Senate had, however,\r\never ventured to determine whether a disputed return, in case any such\r\nhad been received by him, was to be counted, and Mr. Ferry, the\r\nPresident of the Senate, gave his Republican friends to understand that\r\nhe did not feel like assuming any such responsibility.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Republicans in advantage in the count of the vote.]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the Republicans were in decided advantage. They had the\r\nPresident of the United States to execute by force whatever they might\r\nresolve upon, and they had the President of the Senate, whose scruples\r\nthe Democrats had not discovered, and, of course, they had one House of\r\nthe Congress, the Senate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Electoral Commission Bill.]\r\n\r\nThe Democrats felt that they must make an effort to change the\r\nsituation. They, therefore, quickly seized upon a suggestion made by a\r\nRepublican member of the Judiciary Committee of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, Mr. G. W. McCrary, and voted a measure in the House\r\nfor the appointment of {285} members to a joint committee of the two\r\nHouses, which committee should immediately report a proposition for\r\ncounting the electoral votes. This was the 14th of December, 1876. The\r\nSenate agreed to this measure on the next day. Three Republicans and\r\nfour Democrats were appointed by the House, and four Republicans and\r\nthree Democrats by the Senate, and the committee so constituted\r\nreported, on the 18th of January, 1877, the famous Electoral Commission\r\nbill.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The passage of the Bill.]\r\n\r\nThe essential provisions of the bill were, first, the creation of a\r\nCommission composed of five members of the House of Representatives,\r\nfive members of the Senate, and five Justices of the Supreme Court of\r\nthe United States, the members from the House to be chosen by the\r\nHouse, the members from the Senate to be chosen by the Senate, while\r\nthe Justices of the Supreme Court from the first, third, eighth and\r\nninth circuits were designated in the bill, and they were authorized to\r\nselect a fifth from among the other members of the Court; second, the\r\nfixing of the rule that the electoral vote of any \"State\" from which\r\nonly a single return had been received should be counted unless _both_\r\nHouses should decide otherwise, and of the other rule that when more\r\nthan one return had been received from any \"State,\" the Commission\r\nshould forthwith decide which return should be counted, and this return\r\nshould be counted unless _both_ Houses should reject the decision, or\r\norder otherwise; and third, the reservation of any right existing under\r\nthe Constitution and laws to question before the courts of the United\r\nStates the titles of the persons who should be declared elected\r\nPresident and Vice-President to these respective offices. The bill was\r\nsubjected to a most thorough discussion in _both_ Houses. It passed the\r\nSenate on the 24th of January by a vote of forty-seven to seventeen.\r\nTwenty-one {286} Republicans and twenty-six Democrats voted in favor of\r\nit, and sixteen Republicans and one Democrat voted against it. It\r\npassed the House on the 26th by a vote of one hundred and ninety-one to\r\neighty-six. Thirty-three Republicans and one hundred and fifty-eight\r\nDemocrats voted for it, and sixty-eight Republicans and eighteen\r\nDemocrats voted against it. It is certainly fair, therefore, to call it\r\na Democratic measure. The President signed the bill, nevertheless, on\r\nthe 29th.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The members of the Commission.]\r\n\r\nThe Senate immediately chose Messrs. Edmunds, Frelinghuysen and Morton,\r\nRepublicans, and Messrs. Bayard and Thurman, Democrats, to represent it\r\nupon the Commission, and the House chose Messrs. Garfield and Hoar,\r\nRepublicans, and Messrs. Abbott, Hunton and Payne, Democrats. The\r\nJustices of the Supreme Court designated by the bill as members of the\r\nCommission were Messrs. Clifford, Strong, Miller and Field. Strong and\r\nMiller were understood to be Republicans, and Clifford and Field\r\nDemocrats. Upon these four the duty was imposed to select the fifth\r\nJustice.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The fifth Justice.]\r\n\r\nSince without the fifth Justice the Commission would consist of seven\r\nRepublicans and seven Democrats, it was evident that this Justice would\r\nbe the umpire in every question of disputed returns which the two\r\nHouses could not themselves settle by concurrent agreement. The\r\nresponsibility which this Justice would have to bear would be one of\r\nthe most onerous and solemn duties ever imposed upon any mortal. It\r\ncould be no less than the making of a President, and it might be the\r\ndetermination of the question whether there should be another civil\r\nwar. It was not a responsibility to be courted, but no man upon whom it\r\nmight fall could, with honor, refuse to accept it.\r\n\r\nIt was the general feeling throughout the {287} discussion of the bill\r\nthat the man who would be chosen was Judge David Davis. He had been a\r\nRepublican and a close personal friend of Lincoln, but had latterly\r\ninclined toward the Democracy, and, it was thought, had favored the\r\nelection of Mr. Tilden. He was regarded as the man of least political\r\nprejudice among a set of men of very little political prejudice. The\r\nDemocrats, however, were entirely willing to risk their cause in his\r\nhands, because they believed it was strong enough on its merits to\r\nconvince any unprejudiced mind, and there is little question that the\r\nRepublicans were afraid to risk their cause in his hands, because they\r\nknew that they must win on every point or lose altogether, and they\r\nhesitated to take such desperate chances unless whatever political\r\nprejudice might exist in the mind of the umpire should be on their\r\nside.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Justice David Davis.]\r\n\r\nBut to the apparent surprise of everybody and to the consternation of\r\nthe Democrats, Justice Davis was chosen by the Illinois legislature, on\r\nthe 25th of January, the day after the bill passed the Senate, and the\r\nday before it passed the House, United States Senator, and a few days\r\nafter the bill passed the House, he accepted the position, which act\r\ninvolved his resignation at an early day of his judicial office; and as\r\nhe was now to leave the bench and go into the political branch of the\r\nGovernment, as a Democratic Senator, elected by the Democrats of the\r\nIllinois legislature, there appeared to him an evident impropriety in\r\nhis acting on the Commission as a representative of the unpolitical\r\nbranch of the Government, and especially as that member upon whom the\r\nweightiest responsibility would fall, and who would, therefore, be\r\nexpected to act with greatest political impartiality, and with an eye\r\nsingle to public justice. Whether Justice Davis sought this election to\r\nthe senatorship at this juncture or not, {288} in order to escape the\r\ngreat responsibility that was about to fall upon him, we do not know.\r\nHe was not a particularly brave man. He was a big, fat man, a good\r\nliver, and loved his ease. Ordinarily men will not exchange the high\r\nand life-long office of a Justice of the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates for a seat in the Senate. Unless he had his eye upon the\r\nPresidency of the United States, it would be very hard to explain his\r\naction in exchanging his high judicial position for the senatorship on\r\nany other ground than his desire to escape the terrible responsibility\r\nof deciding whether Tilden or Hayes should be President. It is even\r\nmore difficult to account for the action of the Democrats in the\r\nlegislature of Illinois. They certainly did not intend to harm the\r\nchances of Mr. Tilden by this act. The Republicans might have invented\r\nsuch a scheme for disposing of the Justice, but for Democrats to have\r\nbeen concerned in any such movement is incredible. It is probable that\r\nit was simply a blunder on their part. They did not appreciate the\r\nincompatibility between the position of a Democratic Senator-elect and\r\nmembership on the Electoral Commission as a judicial representative.\r\nThey thought that as the Justice would not take his seat in the Senate\r\nuntil after the 4th of March he would remain a member of the Supreme\r\nCourt until then, and as such would be fully qualified for the place on\r\nthe Commission. The legislature at Springfield had no such delicate and\r\ndiscriminating sense of official proprieties as obtained in Washington,\r\nand throughout the more fastidious East.\r\n\r\nThe Democrats in the House of Representatives learned of the election\r\nof Justice Davis to the Senate on the morning of the day they were to\r\nvote on the passage of the Electoral Commission bill. Even they did not\r\nfully realize that it meant that the Justice {289} would not serve on\r\nthe Commission. Moreover, they had gone to such lengths with the bill\r\nthat it was too late to turn back. So far as is known the Justice did\r\nnot inform them or anybody else of his intention to accept the\r\nsenatorship, or of his scruples about being a member of the Commission,\r\nuntil after the bill became law. When he did do so, the correctness of\r\nhis position was so clear that the four Justices named in the Act\r\nimmediately selected Justice Joseph P. Bradley as the fifth judicial\r\nmember of the Commission. Bradley was a Republican, as were the other\r\nthree members of the court, Waite, Hunt and Swayne. That is, after\r\nJustice Davis was disposed of there remained only Republicans to choose\r\nfrom, and Bradley being regarded as the least partisan, and the most\r\nlearned in the law, was selected. He fully realized the vast\r\nresponsibility which had been thus unexpectedly thrust upon him, but he\r\naccepted it bravely and without flinching, and discharged it with honor\r\nand success.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The counting of the electoral vote by Congress.]\r\n\r\nThe Houses of Congress, and also the Electoral Commission, met on the\r\n1st day of February to count the electoral vote. The Democrats still\r\nfelt sure of success, since they would win the election, if successful\r\nupon a single point, while the Republicans, to be successful, must win\r\nupon every point. On the other hand, the hopes of the Republicans had\r\nbeen raised by gaining the majority of the Commission.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The double returns from South Carolina, Florida, Louisiana\r\nand Oregon.]\r\n\r\nWhen the returns were opened by the President of the Senate two sets of\r\nreturns were found from each of the four \"States,\" Florida, Louisiana,\r\nSouth Carolina, and Oregon. In the case of Florida the electors voting\r\nfor Hayes and Wheeler sent with their votes the certification of the\r\n\"State\" Canvassing Board and of the Governor to their election. The\r\ncase of South Carolina was the same. {290} In the case of Louisiana the\r\nelectors voting for Hayes and Wheeler sent with their votes the\r\ncertification of Governor Kellogg and of the \"State\" Canvassing Board\r\nacting with him to their election, and the electors voting for Tilden\r\nand Hendricks sent the certification of John McEnery, claiming to be\r\nGovernor, and the Canvassing Board acting with him, to their election.\r\n\r\nThe Oregon case was more complicated. The three Republican electors\r\nreceived the highest number of votes, as reported by the Secretary of\r\nState, who by the laws of Oregon was the \"State\" canvassing officer, to\r\nthe Governor. But one of them, Watts, held the office of postmaster in\r\na small place at the time of his election, and the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States provides that \"no Senator or Representative, or person\r\nholding any office of trust or profit under the United States, shall be\r\nappointed an elector.\" The Democratic Governor of Oregon decided in his\r\nown mind that Watts was not eligible, and made out his certification to\r\ninclude, beside the two Republican electors who were eligible, one\r\nCronin, the Democrat receiving the highest number of votes for elector,\r\nalthough the number received by him was a minority of all the votes\r\ncast for the electoral tickets. This certificate was attested by the\r\nSecretary of State, and was given to Cronin. When the day for the\r\nmeeting of the electors came around Cronin presented himself holding\r\nthe Governor's certificate, the only certificate which had been issued\r\nto the electors by Governor Grover. But in spite of the fact that he\r\nhad this technical advantage, the two Republican electors, whose names\r\nwere included in the Governor's certificate, refused to act with him,\r\nand he refused to let them have the certificate to attach to their\r\nreturn of the electoral vote to the President of the Senate of the\r\nUnited States unless they should so act. Both parties persisted {291}\r\nin their refusals. Whereupon Cronin selected one J. N. Y. Miller and\r\none John Parker to fill up the electoral college of Oregon and these\r\nthree cast two electoral votes for Hayes and Wheeler and one for Tilden\r\nand Hendricks, and, after attaching the Governor's certification to the\r\nrecord of their vote in due form, sent this return to the President of\r\nthe Senate of the United States, as required by the Constitution. At\r\nthe same time the two Republican electors, Odell and Cartwright, met to\r\ncast the electoral vote of the Commonwealth. Watts was also present. He\r\nhad resigned his office of postmaster, and now he resigned his position\r\nas elector. The other two accepted his resignation, and immediately\r\nchose him an elector. The three then cast the electoral vote of the\r\nCommonwealth for Hayes and Wheeler. As we have seen, they did not have\r\nthe certification of their election by the Governor to attach to their\r\nvotes, as required by the law of the United States, but they procured\r\nfrom the Secretary of State a certified copy of the canvass of the\r\nvotes for the electors, which showed the election of the three\r\nRepublican candidates, and sent this, and also a copy of their\r\nproceedings in accepting the resignation of Watts, and then electing\r\nhim an elector, along with their report of the vote of the electors for\r\nPresident and Vice-President, to the President of the Senate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The counsel before the Commission.]\r\n\r\nBoth the Republicans and the Democrats were represented by most able\r\ncounsel before the Electoral Commission. William M. Evarts, Stanley\r\nMatthews, E. W. Stoughton, and Samuel Shellabarger were pitted against\r\na formidable array both as to ability and numbers on the other side,\r\nJudge J. S. Black, Matthew H. Carpenter, Charles O'Conor, J. A.\r\nCampbell, Lyman Trumbull, Ashbel Green, Montgomery Blair, George\r\nHoadly, William C. Whitney, R. T. Merrick and A. P. Morse.\r\n\r\n{292} [Sidenote: The Republican position.]\r\n\r\nThe Republicans took their stand at the outset upon the principle that\r\nCongress could not go behind the returns of the \"State\" Canvassing\r\nBoard or officer, in counting the electoral vote from any \"State.\" They\r\ncontended that in the election of the President and Vice-President, the\r\nConstitution had separated the procedure into two distinct parts, and\r\nhad assigned the first part to the control of the several \"States\"\r\nexclusively, and the second part to the control of Congress\r\nexclusively; that up to the completion of the election of the electors\r\nthe exclusive control of the \"States\" respectively extended, but that\r\nall control after that point had been reached was in Congress, and that\r\nCongress had no power whatever, under the Constitution, to revise,\r\ninterfere with, or examine into, that part assigned by the Constitution\r\nto the \"States\" respectively, and, on the other hand, that Congress was\r\nbound to disregard any act of the \"States,\" or of any of the officers\r\nor agents of the \"States,\" in that part assigned exclusively by the\r\nConstitution to its own control. There is no question that this was all\r\nsound constitutional law and that the Democrats would have to abandon\r\nentirely their old \"States'\" rights doctrine and go over to the most\r\nextreme nationalism in order to combat it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Democratic position.]\r\n\r\nIt did not appear to them necessary to do this in order to win their\r\ncase. One single electoral vote from any one of the four \"States,\" from\r\nwhich double returns had been received, would elect Tilden and\r\nHendricks. It did not seem to them that the line between the powers of\r\nthe \"States\" and those of Congress over the election of the President\r\nand Vice-President could under the existing facts be drawn anywhere\r\nwithout giving them at least this one vote. If the returns as certified\r\nto by the Governors and the \"State\" canvassing officer, officers, or\r\nboards, of these four {293} \"States\" should be received and counted\r\nthey would have this one vote from Oregon. If, on the other hand, the\r\npopular vote for the electors as it came into the hands of the \"State\"\r\ncanvassing officers or boards was to be received and counted, then they\r\nwould have the electoral votes of at least Louisiana, Florida, or South\r\nCarolina, and perhaps of all of them. But the Republicans contended\r\nthat the line between \"State\" control and Congressional control was to\r\nbe drawn between the Governor's certification and the report of the\r\n\"State\" canvassing officer, officers, or board to the Governor of the\r\nresult of the vote for the electors. The certification issued by the\r\nGovernor, they held, was ordered by Congressional law and was under\r\nCongressional control, even when the \"State\" canvassing officer,\r\nofficers, or board should join with the Governor in the certification\r\nof the persons chosen electors. The report of the vote for the electors\r\nby the \"State\" canvassing officer, officers, or board to the Governor\r\nwas thus the final act under \"State\" control, was the final act in the\r\nelection of the electors. This was unquestionably sound constitutional\r\nlaw. But it would give all the electoral votes from all four of the\r\n\"States,\" from which double returns had been received, to Hayes and\r\nWheeler, and would elect them by one vote.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The decisions of the Commission.]\r\n\r\nThe view of the counsel for the Republican candidates prevailed with a\r\nmajority of the Commission. By a majority of a single vote the\r\nCommission gave all the electoral votes of the four \"States\" from which\r\ndouble returns had been received to Hayes and Wheeler, and since the\r\ndecisions of the Commission were final unless negatived by both Houses\r\nof Congress, and the Republican Senate, of course, sustained the\r\ndecisions of the Commission, there was nothing for the Democrats to do\r\nbut submit or have recourse to violence. Threats were freely expressed\r\nof having {294} Mr. Tilden take the oath of office, and then conducting\r\nhim, under the support of a large armed body, to the White House and\r\ninstalling him there. But it was observed that the Southern Democrats\r\ndid not participate in these menacing declarations, and it was soon\r\nlearned that Mr. Tilden himself would not lend himself to any such\r\ndesperate movement. Moreover, the existing President had, with his\r\nusual promptness and decision, prepared himself to meet all exigencies,\r\nand had let it be known that he would uphold the decisions to which\r\nCongress and its Commission might come by any power necessary to\r\naccomplish the result.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Hayes declared President.]\r\n\r\nIn the early morning of March 2d, the count was completed, and Hayes\r\nand Wheeler were proclaimed by the presiding officer of the Senate, Mr.\r\nFerry, elected President and Vice-President of the United States by a\r\nmajority of one electoral vote. The popular vote for the electors was\r\nabout eight millions three hundred thousand. Of this vast number the\r\nTilden electors had received the majority by about two hundred and\r\nfifty thousand, according to the Republican count, and by about three\r\nhundred thousand, according to the Democratic count. It must be\r\nremembered, however, that it is quite possible for the candidate of one\r\nparty to receive a popular majority throughout the whole country, and\r\nthe candidate of the other to receive a majority of the electoral\r\nvotes, simply because the popular vote is counted, in electing the\r\nelectors, by \"States\" and not in the aggregate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The truth in regard to the election.]\r\n\r\nThe truth in regard to the whole transaction of the election probably\r\nis that the Democrats did in some places in the South intimidate\r\nvoters; that the Republican \"State\" canvassing officers, making this a\r\njustification, or an excuse, did throw out votes that ought to have\r\nbeen counted; and that the existing law of {295} elections,\r\nadministered by Republicans, was capable of being so interpreted as to\r\ngive legal warrant to all that was done by them. A perfectly fair\r\nelection in the \"States\" of Louisiana, Florida, and South Carolina,\r\nwith the law of suffrage then obtaining, would probably have resulted\r\nin a popular majority for the Republican candidates for electors.\r\nAccepting the law of suffrage as then existing for the basis of our\r\nreasoning, it will have to be conceded that the Republicans were in the\r\nright both morally and legally, and that the title of Hayes and Wheeler\r\nto the offices of President and Vice-President was entirely sound and\r\nunimpeachable. They were inaugurated on the 5th day of March, 1877,\r\nwithout any attempt at resistance or disturbance from any quarter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Hayes's Southern policy.]\r\n\r\nDuring the counting of the electoral vote it was suspected that the\r\nfriends of Mr. Hayes were giving some assurances to the Southerners in\r\nCongress in regard to what the policy of his Administration would be\r\nconcerning the \"State\" governments in the South. The unwillingness of\r\nthe Southern Democrats to join with their party associates of the North\r\nin any revolutionary projects was attributed partly to this. While\r\nthere is no evidence that Mr. Hayes ever pledged himself to the\r\nSoutherners in regard to anything, still it is probably true that his\r\nviews concerning the unwisdom of the employment of the military power\r\nof the United States in upholding the negro-Republican \"State\"\r\ngovernments in the South were imparted to them by his friends. At any\r\nrate, he announced in his inaugural address that he considered the\r\nre-establishment of local self-government in these \"States\" to be one\r\nof the prime objects of his Administration, and he speedily withdrew\r\nthe support of the military power of the United States from the three\r\n{296} negro-Republican \"State\" governments, and left them to their own\r\nresources.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The result of his policy.]\r\n\r\nThe result was that, although the Republican candidates for Governor\r\nand for the members of the legislature in these three \"States\" received\r\nabout the same vote as the Republican presidential electors, and in\r\nJanuary of 1877 actually assumed power, the Democratic candidates\r\nousted them from the offices, and in sufficient number from the\r\nlegislative seats, and established at last Democratic white rule in all\r\nthe \"States\" of the South. In Florida the Republican, M. L. Stearns,\r\ngave way to the Democrat, George F. Drew, in the gubernatorial office;\r\nin South Carolina D. H. Chamberlain gave way to Wade Hampton, and in\r\nLouisiana, S. B. Packard gave way to Francis T. Nicholls.\r\n\r\nOrder and peace were quickly established everywhere, and the plundered\r\nand impoverished South could at last take hope and feel courage to make\r\na new effort to recover some degree of prosperity and some measure of\r\ndomestic content. For ten years the dark night of domination by the\r\nnegro and adventurer had rested upon the unhappy section, until it had\r\nbeen reduced to the very abomination of desolation. Broken in health\r\nand fortune, sick at heart, conscious of the terrible degradation which\r\nhad been imposed upon them, and politically ostracized, the better part\r\nof the white population of the South had staggered and groped through\r\nthe hideous experiences of this period, and such of them as had not\r\nperished during the awful passage had now at last been relieved of the\r\nfrightful scourge, and half dazed, as if just recovering from a\r\nterrible nightmare, found themselves again in the places of power and\r\nresponsibility. But they brought with them, as their dominant passion,\r\nundying hatred of the Republican party as the author of all their woes,\r\nand as their {297} dominant policy, the stern and unbending resolve to\r\nstand together as one man against every movement which had even the\r\nslightest tendency toward a restoration of the hated conditions from\r\nwhich they had escaped. No sane mind can wonder at \"the solid South,\"\r\nor at the Democratic South. Life, property, happiness, honor,\r\ncivilization, everything which makes existence endurable demanded that\r\nthe decent white men of the South should stand shoulder to shoulder in\r\ndefending their families, their homes and their communities from any\r\nreturn of the vile plague under which they had suffered so long and so\r\ncruelly; and human instinct determined that this should be done in\r\nconnection with that party which was hostile to the Republican party.\r\nThe differences which lead to a fair fight and the wounds which are\r\nreceived in it are easily healed, but indignities heaped upon a fallen\r\nfoe create a bitterness of heart that lasts so long as life endures.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reconciliation between the North and the South.]\r\n\r\nSlavery was a great wrong, and secession was an error and a terrible\r\nblunder, but Reconstruction was a punishment so far in excess of the\r\ncrime that it extinguished every sense of culpability upon the part of\r\nthose whom it was sought to convict and convert. More than a quarter of\r\na century has now passed since the blunder-crime of Reconstruction\r\nplayed its baleful part in alienating the two sections of the country.\r\nUntil four years ago little progress had been made in reconciling them.\r\nIt is said now that the recent war with Spain, in which men from the\r\nNorth and men from the South marched under the same banner to battle\r\nand to victory, has buried the hatchet forever between them. But they\r\nhad done this many times before, and yet it did not prevent the attempt\r\nto destroy the Union. It cannot be in this alone that the South feels\r\nincreased security against the doctrines and the {298} policies and\r\ninterferences of the Republican party with regard to the negro\r\nquestion, the great question which has made and kept the South solidly\r\nDemocratic. It is something far more significant and substantial than\r\nthis. It is to some the pleasing, though to others startling, fact,\r\nthat the Republican party, in its work of imposing the sovereignty of\r\nthe United States upon eight millions of Asiatics, has changed its\r\nviews in regard to the political relation of races and has at last\r\nvirtually accepted the ideas of the South upon that subject. The white\r\nmen of the South need now have no further fear that the Republican\r\nparty, or Republican Administrations, will ever again give themselves\r\nover to the vain imagination of the political equality of man. It is\r\nthis change of mind and heart on the part of the North in regard to\r\nthis vital question of Southern \"State\" polity which has caused the now\r\nmuch-talked-of reconciliation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{299}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL RELATIONS OF THE UNITED STATES BETWEEN 1867 AND 1877\r\n\r\nThe Purchase of Alaska--The Contention of the House of Representatives\r\nin Regard to its Power over Treaties--The Senate's Position and the\r\nCompromise--Irritation of the American People against Great\r\nBritain--The Johnson-Clarendon Treaty--President Grant's Statements in\r\nHis First Annual Message and in His Second Annual Address--Sir John\r\nRose's Mission to the United States--The Joint High Commission--The\r\nTreaty of Washington--The Alabama Claims and the Geneva\r\nConvention--Triumph of the Diplomacy of the United States--Organization\r\nof the Tribunal and Filing of the Cases--The Controversy between Mr.\r\nFish and Lord Granville--The Filing of the Counter Cases and the\r\nArgument--Obstacles--Decision of the Tribunal in Regard to National and\r\nIndirect Damages--The Decision of the Tribunal in the Case of the\r\n_Florida_--The Decision in the Case of the _Alabama_--The Decision in\r\nthe Case of the _Shenandoah_, and other Vessels--International\r\nPrinciples Settled by the Geneva Tribunal--The Northwest Boundary\r\nQuestion--The Fisheries Question--The Halifax Commission and Award--The\r\nBurlingame Treaty with China--The Attempt to Annex the Dominican\r\nRepublic to the United States--The Treaty--The Treaty before the\r\nSenate--Its Rejection--The President's Attempt to Renew\r\nNegotiations--The Committee of Inquiry--The Report of the\r\nCommittee--The Abandonment of the Scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two chief products of American diplomacy in the decade between 1867\r\nand 1877 were the purchase of Alaska, and the treaty of Washington with\r\nGreat Britain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The purchase of Alaska.]\r\n\r\nThe purchase of Alaska, the northwest corner of the North American\r\ncontinent, together with the islands {300} adjacent thereto, a vast\r\nregion of some five hundred thousand square miles in extent, inhabited\r\nchiefly by a few savage tribes, was effected by a treaty, negotiated by\r\nMr. Seward and the Russian diplomatist, Baron Stoeckl, and ratified by\r\nthe Senate of the United States on the 30th of March, 1867.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The reasons for and against the purchase.]\r\n\r\nThe proposition came from the side of Russia, and it appeared that\r\nRussia was more eager to sell than the United States was to buy. The\r\nprice agreed on was seven millions two hundred thousand dollars in\r\ngold, and most people in the United States thought, at the time, that\r\nthis great sum was being paid for nothing but a barren area of snow and\r\nice. The country was declared to be utterly worthless by some of the\r\nbest informed men in Congress, and a man of no less ability and\r\ninfluence than Mr. Shellabarger opposed the purchase on the ground that\r\nit involved an extension of territory dangerous to the existence of the\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, such men as General Banks and Mr. Stevens contended\r\nthat from the point of view of a business transaction alone it was\r\nworth the money; and Mr. Higby, of California, told his colleagues that\r\nthey were mistaken in regard to the climate of the region. The\r\nconsideration, however, which seems to have had most weight was\r\ngratitude toward Russia, whose government had manifested the most\r\nfriendly feeling for the Union in the struggle against the giant\r\nrebellion, and had even threatened interference in behalf of the Union\r\nagainst interference in behalf of the Confederacy by any other European\r\nstate. That acute observer of political opinion, Mr. Blaine, affirmed\r\nthat a like offer from any other European government would most\r\nprobably have been declined.\r\n\r\n{301} [Sidenote: A real political reason for the purchase.]\r\n\r\nIt is, however, almost certain that Mr. Seward had another very\r\nprofound reason for making the purchase, one which he could not very\r\nwell proclaim from the housetops, especially as the feeling on his\r\npart, and on the part of the Government and of the people of the North,\r\nwas most kindly toward Russia. It was this: The United States would in\r\nthis way and at a comparatively small cost rid herself forever of any\r\ndanger of Russian colonization on the North American continent, and of\r\nthe danger of any complications between Russia and Great Britain upon\r\nthis continent. This was a most important political consideration, one\r\nwhich much overbalanced the price paid for the territory and the cost\r\nof its administration.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The contention of the House of Representatives in regard to\r\nits power over treaties involving the payment of money by the United\r\nStates.]\r\n\r\nWhen the bill for making the appropriation to pay for Alaska came\r\nbefore the House of Representatives, that body raised the question of\r\nthe power of the House over treaties involving the payment of money by\r\nthe United States, by asserting in the preamble of the bill that its\r\nconsent was necessary to the validity of such treaties. It did so on\r\nthe ground that as an independent legislative body it could refuse any\r\nappropriation at its own discretion, and that as all foreign countries\r\nwere bound to know this from the wording of the Constitution, no\r\nforeign country could consider a treaty with the United States,\r\ninvolving financial obligations by the United States, as completed\r\nuntil the House of Representatives should have voted the appropriation\r\nof the amount stipulated in the agreement.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Senate's position and the compromise.]\r\n\r\nThe Senate, on the other hand, repudiated this doctrine, and rejected\r\nthe bill with the preamble containing it as it came from the House of\r\nRepresentatives. {302} The bill then went to a conference committee of\r\nthe two Houses, and this committee invented a preamble which read:\r\n\"Whereas the President has entered into a treaty with the Emperor of\r\nRussia, and the Senate thereafter gave its advice and consent to said\r\ntreaty, and whereas said stipulations cannot be carried into full force\r\nand effect, except by legislation to which the consent of both Houses\r\nof Congress is necessary; therefore be it resolved,\" etc. Both Houses\r\nadopted the bill in this form and it became law July 27th, 1868.\r\n\r\nThe contention of the House was good political science, but it is still\r\ndoubtful whether it is the constitutional law of the United States or\r\nnot. The more recent constitutions of even the European states, such as\r\nthose of Germany and France, make the consent of both houses of the\r\nlegislature necessary to the validity of all treaties involving the\r\nappropriation of money, or the assumption of any financial obligation.\r\nThis is as it should be; and the Constitution of the United States\r\nought to be so amended as to establish clearly the same principle.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Irritation of the American people against Great Britain.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Change of Ministry and Parliamentary majority in 1867.]\r\n\r\nWe have, in the preceding volume of this series, followed the history\r\nof the relations of the United States with Great Britain down to the\r\nclose of the rebellion, and have referred to the general irritation on\r\nthe part of the loyal people of the United States against the British\r\ngovernment for its attitude in regard to the acts of its subjects in\r\nfurnishing warships and munitions to the Confederates. There were many\r\nwho favored turning the great military power with which the United\r\nStates emerged from the Civil War against Great Britain, and forcing a\r\nsettlement of those difficulties by the trial of arms; but Seward\r\nremained in the direction of the foreign affairs of the Union, and he\r\nhad had enough of war. Moreover, he {303} foresaw a change of\r\ngovernment in Great Britain, and with it he hoped for a change of\r\nsentiment on the part of the new government on the international\r\nquestion. This event happened in consequence of the parliamentary\r\nelection of 1867. The Minister of Foreign Affairs in Mr. Gladstone's\r\ncabinet was first Lord Stanley, and then the Earl of Clarendon, both of\r\nthem very different in character from Lord John Russell. From the\r\noutset each of them manifested a sincere desire to reach an amicable\r\nsettlement of all differences with the United States. The trouble at\r\nthis juncture seems to have been the extravagance of the claims of the\r\nUnited States. Mr. Adams, whose patience had become much worn, talked\r\nabout private damages, national damages and an apology. The British\r\nMinisters thought this too preposterous to be seriously meant.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Johnson-Clarendon treaty.]\r\n\r\nBefore, however, the discussion had fairly begun Mr. Adams returned to\r\nthe United States, and Mr. Reverdy Johnson was sent out to the British\r\nCourt. Mr. Johnson yielded much of the ground assumed by Mr. Adams in\r\nreference to claims for national injury, and in January of 1869\r\nconcluded an agreement with the Earl of Clarendon for submitting to\r\narbitration the claims for direct damage to property rights.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: President Grant's statement in his first Annual Message.]\r\n\r\nThe Senate of the United States promptly rejected the treaty with much\r\nfeeling, because it did not contain proper provision, in its view, for\r\nthe reparation of wrongs to the Nation. The feeling among the people of\r\nboth countries ran so high that the Governments deemed it wise to\r\ncease, for a time, negotiations upon the subject. The new President,\r\nGrant, in his Message of December 6th, 1869, described the situation in\r\nthe following language:\r\n\r\n{304} \"Toward the close of the last Administration a convention was\r\nsigned in London for the settlement of all outstanding claims between\r\nGreat Britain and the United States, which failed to receive the advice\r\nand consent of the Senate to its ratification. The time and the\r\ncircumstances attending the negotiation of that treaty were unfavorable\r\nto its acceptance by the people of the United States, and its\r\nprovisions were wholly inadequate for the settlement of the grave\r\nwrongs that had been sustained by this Government, as well as by its\r\ncitizens. The injuries resulting to the United States by reason of the\r\ncourse adopted by Great Britain during our late Civil War in the\r\nincreased rates of insurance, in the diminution of exports and imports\r\nand other obstructions to domestic industry and production, in its\r\neffect upon the foreign commerce of the country, in the decrease and\r\ntransfer to Great Britain of our commercial marine, in the prolongation\r\nof the war and the increased cost, both in treasure and lives, of its\r\nsuppression, could not be adjusted and satisfied as ordinary commercial\r\nclaims which continually arise among commercial nations; and yet the\r\nconvention treated them as such ordinary claims, from which they differ\r\nmore widely in the gravity of their character than in the magnitude of\r\ntheir amount, great even as is that difference. Not a word was found in\r\nthe treaty, and not an inference could be drawn from it, to remove the\r\nsense of the unfriendliness of the course of Great Britain in our\r\nstruggle for existence, which had so deeply and universally impressed\r\nitself upon the people of this country. Believing that a convention\r\nthus misconceived in its scope and inadequate in its provisions would\r\nnot have produced the hearty, cordial settlement of pending questions,\r\nwhich alone is consistent with the relations which I desire to have\r\nfirmly established {305} between the United States and Great Britain, I\r\nregarded the action of the Senate in rejecting the treaty to have been\r\nwisely taken in the interests of peace and as a necessary step in the\r\ndirection of a perfect and cordial friendship between the two\r\ncountries. A sensitive people, conscious of their power, are more at\r\nease under a great wrong wholly unatoned than under the restraint of a\r\nsettlement which satisfies neither their ideas of justice nor their\r\ngrave sense of the grievance they have sustained. The rejection of the\r\ntreaty was followed by a state of public feeling on both sides which I\r\nthought not favorable to an immediate attempt at renewed negotiations.\r\nI accordingly so instructed the Minister of the United States to Great\r\nBritain, and found that my views in this regard were shared by Her\r\nMajesty's Ministers. I hope that the time may soon arrive when the two\r\nGovernments can approach the solution of this momentous question with\r\nan appreciation of what is due to the rights, dignity and honor of\r\neach, and with the determination not only to remove the causes of\r\ncomplaint in the past, but to lay the foundation of a broad principle\r\nof public law which will prevent future differences and tend to firm\r\nand continued peace and friendship.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The President's statement in his second annual message.]\r\n\r\nFor another year things drifted, and the views of the two Governments\r\nseemed to be getting wider apart, when President Grant wrote in his\r\nMessage of December 5th, 1870:\r\n\r\n\"I regret to say that no conclusion has been reached for the adjustment\r\nof the claims against Great Britain growing out of the course adopted\r\nby that Government during the Rebellion. The Cabinet of London, so far\r\nas its views have been expressed, does not appear to be willing to\r\nconcede that Her Majesty's Government was guilty of any negligence, or\r\ndid or permitted any act during the War {306} by which the United\r\nStates has just cause of complaint. Our firm and unalterable\r\nconvictions are directly the reverse. I therefore recommend to Congress\r\nto authorize the appointment of a commission to take proof of the\r\namount and the ownership of these several claims, on notice to the\r\nrepresentative of Her Majesty at Washington, and that authority be\r\ngiven for the settlement of these claims by the United States, so that\r\nthe Government shall have the ownership of the private claims, as well\r\nas the responsible control of all the demands against Great Britain. It\r\ncannot be necessary to add that whenever Her Majesty's Government shall\r\nentertain a desire for a full and friendly adjustment of these claims\r\nthe United States will enter upon their consideration with an earnest\r\ndesire for a conclusion consistent with the honor and dignity of both\r\nnations.\"\r\n\r\nThis was what is now called \"a twist of the lion's tail.\" It was\r\nsomething of a twist, although it was accompanied with the offer of the\r\nolive branch, instead of the sword. It was effective, even more\r\neffective for the conciliatory tone of the final paragraph. Moreover,\r\nwith the German armies encamped around Paris and throughout France, the\r\naffairs of Continental Europe were too unsettled and precarious for\r\nGreat Britain to run the risk of any serious complications with the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sir John Rose's mission to the United States.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Joint High Commission.]\r\n\r\nAccepting the President's message as an invitation to renew\r\nnegotiations, the British Government, at the beginning of the next year\r\n(1871), sent Sir John Rose to Washington to sound the President in\r\nregard to the matter. The President greeted his advances with great\r\ncordiality, and on the 26th of the month (January), Sir Edward\r\nThornton, the British Minister to the United States, formally proposed\r\nto the Hon. Hamilton Fish, the Secretary of State, the appointment of a\r\nJoint High {307} Commission, to consist of five persons representing\r\neach Government, to sit at Washington, for the purpose of settling the\r\nquestions between the two Governments relative to Great Britain's North\r\nAmerican possessions. Mr. Fish immediately expressed the willingness of\r\nhis Government to enter upon the negotiation, provided the differences\r\ngrowing out of the events of the Civil War should be included among the\r\nsubjects to be considered. The British Government accepted Mr. Fish's\r\nproviso, and the respective Governments proceeded to appoint the\r\nmembers of the Commission. President Grant designated Hamilton Fish,\r\nEbenezer R. Hoar, Justice Samuel Nelson, Robert C. Schenck and George\r\nH. Williams. Her Majesty selected Earl de Grey and Ripon, Sir John\r\nMacdonald, Sir Stafford Northcote, Sir Edward Thornton and Professor\r\nMountague Bernard. These eminent gentlemen proceeded immediately upon\r\ntheir momentous undertaking, and on the 8th of May (1871) concluded the\r\ntreaty between the two Governments, known as the Treaty of Washington,\r\nwhich was duly ratified, and on the 4th of July proclaimed to the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Treaty of Washington.]\r\n\r\nThe first eleven articles of this agreement relate to the claims for\r\ndamages arising from the incidents of the Civil War, known as the\r\nAlabama Claims. This was the subject of transcendent importance in the\r\nTreaty; this was the subject which was, by these articles, referred to\r\nthe Court of Arbitration to sit at Geneva.\r\n\r\nThey contain, in the first place, an expression of regret for the\r\nescape of the Confederate vessels from British ports and for the\r\ndepredations committed by them.\r\n\r\nThey provide, secondly, for a tribunal of arbitration, composed of five\r\nmembers, one of whom should be {308} named by the President of the\r\nUnited States, one by Her Britannic Majesty, one by the King of Italy,\r\none by the President of the Swiss Confederation, and one by the Emperor\r\nof Brazil; and, in case either of these last three mentioned should\r\nfail to name an arbitrator, they provide that one should be named by\r\nthe King of Sweden and Norway; and finally, that one agent should be\r\nnamed by each of the high contracting parties to represent it generally\r\nin all matters connected with the arbitration.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Alabama claims and the Geneva convention.]\r\n\r\nThey provide, in the third place, that \"the Arbitrators shall meet at\r\nGeneva, in Switzerland, at the earliest convenient day after they shall\r\nhave been named, and shall proceed impartially carefully to examine and\r\ndecide all questions that shall be laid before them on the part of the\r\nGovernments of the United States and Her Britannic Majesty\r\nrespectively,\" and that \"all questions considered by the Tribunal,\r\nincluding the final award, shall be decided by a majority of all the\r\narbitrators.\"\r\n\r\nThey provide, in the fourth place, that each of the two high\r\ncontracting parties should deliver his written or printed case,\r\ntogether with all the evidence in support of it, to each of the\r\narbitrators and to the agent of the other party, as soon as possible\r\nafter the organization of the Tribunal, and within a period not\r\nexceeding six months from the 17th of June, 1871; that within four\r\nmonths after the delivery on both sides of the case, each party might\r\nput in a counter case, with additional evidence, in reply to the case\r\nof the other party; that the arbitrators might extend the time, under\r\ncertain circumstances, for delivering the counter case; that \"within\r\ntwo months after the expiration of the time limited for the delivery of\r\nthe counter case on both sides,\" the agent of each party should deliver\r\nto each of {309} the arbitrators \"and to the agent of the other party a\r\nwritten or printed argument showing the points and referring to the\r\nevidence upon which his Government relies\"; and that the arbitrators\r\nmight require further argument by counsel, giving to each party an\r\nequal chance to be heard.\r\n\r\nThey provide, in the fifth place, that the Tribunal should consider the\r\ncase of each vessel separately; that it might, however, award a gross\r\nsum, or that in case it did not award a sum in gross, the high\r\ncontracting parties should appoint two members of a board of assessors,\r\nand request the Italian Minister at Washington to appoint a third,\r\nwhich board should determine the amounts due in the cases in which the\r\narbitrators had pronounced responsibility.\r\n\r\nThey provide, in the sixth place, that in deciding the matters\r\nsubmitted the arbitrators should be governed by the following rules:\r\n\r\n\"A neutral government is bound, first, to use diligence to prevent the\r\nfitting out, arming, or equipping, within its jurisdiction, of any\r\nvessel which it has reasonable ground to believe is intended to cruise\r\nor to carry on war against a Power with which it is at peace; and also\r\nto use like diligence to prevent the departure from its jurisdiction of\r\nany vessel intended to cruise or carry on war as above, such vessel\r\nhaving been specially adapted, in whole or in part, within such\r\njurisdiction, to warlike use. Secondly, not to permit or suffer either\r\nbelligerent to make use of its ports or waters as the base of naval\r\noperations against the other, or for the purpose of the renewal or\r\naugmentation of military supplies or arms, or the recruitment of men.\r\nThirdly, to exercise due diligence in its own ports and waters, and, as\r\nto all persons within its jurisdiction, to prevent any violation of the\r\nforegoing obligations and duties.\"\r\n\r\n{310} They provide, in the seventh place, that the high contracting\r\nparties would \"agree to observe these rules as between themselves in\r\nthe future, and to bring them to the knowledge of other maritime\r\npowers, and to invite them to accede to them.\"\r\n\r\nAnd they provide, finally, that the result of the proceedings of the\r\nTribunal and the Board of Assessors, in case such board should be\r\nappointed, should be accepted as a final settlement of all the claims\r\nknown as the Alabama Claims, and should be a bar to any further\r\nproceedings in regard to them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Triumph of the diplomacy of the United States.]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the Government of the United States had in this\r\nTreaty substantially won all of the points for which it had contended.\r\nThe Queen's Government had apologized. It had agreed that the general\r\nprinciples of international law in regard to the duties of neutrals\r\ntoward belligerents should take precedence over municipal statutes, and\r\nshould not be limited by municipal statutes. And it had agreed that the\r\nTribunal of Arbitration should decide _all questions_ laid before it by\r\nthe Governments of the United States and of Her Britannic Majesty\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\nIt is true that Her Majesty's Government qualified its acceptance of\r\nthe rules to be applied in determining its responsibility by inserting\r\nan explanation in the Treaty of the following tenor: \"Her Britannic\r\nMajesty has commanded her High Commissioners and Plenipotentiaries to\r\ndeclare that Her Majesty's Government cannot assent to the foregoing\r\nrules as a statement of principles of international law which were in\r\nforce at the time when the claims mentioned in Article I. arose, but\r\nthat Her Majesty's Government, in order to evince its desire of\r\nstrengthening the friendly relations between the two countries and of\r\nmaking satisfactory provision for the {311} future, agrees that, in\r\ndeciding the questions between the two countries arising out of those\r\nclaims, the Arbitrators should assume that Her Majesty's Government had\r\nundertaken to act upon the principles set forth in these rules.\"\r\n\r\nAnd it is also true that, while, according to the letter of the Treaty,\r\nthe United States Government was left unfettered as to the character of\r\nthe claims which it might lay before the Arbitrators, Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment had been led to expect more moderation in this respect than\r\nthe popular sentiment in the United States seemed to indicate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The arbitrators, agents and counsel.]\r\n\r\nThe two Governments and the high personages invited by them proceeded\r\nin due time to appoint the Arbitrators. The President of the United\r\nStates appointed Mr. Charles Francis Adams; Her Majesty named Chief\r\nJustice Alexander Cockburn; the Italian King designated Count Frederic\r\nSclopis; the President of the Swiss Confederation designated Mr. Jacob\r\nStaempfli, and the Emperor of Brazil named the Baron d'Itajubá.\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States also appointed Mr. J. C. Bancroft\r\nDavis as the agent of the United States before the Tribunal, and Mr.\r\nCaleb Cushing, Mr. William M. Evarts and Mr. Morrison R. Waite as\r\ncounsel.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty's Government also appointed Lord Tenterden as the agent of\r\nGreat Britain before the Tribunal, and Sir Roundell Palmer as chief\r\ncounsel.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Organization of the Tribunal and filing of the cases.]\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of December, 1871, the Arbitrators organized the Tribunal\r\nat Geneva with Count Frederic Sclopis in the chair as presiding\r\nofficer, and with Mr. Alexander Favrot as secretary. The printed case\r\nof each of the high contracting parties was filed immediately by the\r\nagent of each, and the Tribunal ordered the counter cases to be filed\r\n{312} on or before the 15th day of the following April. The Tribunal\r\nthen adjourned to June 15th following, unless sooner called together by\r\nthe secretary.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The controversy between Mr. Fish and Lord Granville.]\r\n\r\nThe contents of the case of the United States became immediately known\r\nto the British Ministers, but not for some weeks to the British people.\r\nThe Ministers were not apparently disturbed in mind about it, although\r\nthey discovered at once that it contained claims for national damages\r\nand indirect damages as well as for direct damages to individuals; but\r\nas soon as the newspapers got hold of this fact, they raised a\r\ntremendous hue and cry, and accused those who had prepared the case of\r\ntaking an unfair advantage of the wording of the treaty. The Minister\r\nof the United States in London, General Schenck, informed Mr. Fish by\r\ncable of the agitation in London over the subject and of the demand of\r\nthe newspapers that the claim for national and indirect damages should\r\nbe withdrawn. Mr. Fish replied firmly that \"there must be no withdrawal\r\nof any part of the claim presented.\" At this moment the session of\r\nParliament opened and the Queen's speech contained a criticism of the\r\nextravagance of the claims of the United States in the case submitted\r\nto the Tribunal. The matter was warmly debated in Parliament, and on\r\nFebruary 3d the British Foreign Minister, Lord Granville, opened a\r\ndiplomatic discussion with Mr. Fish upon the subject. Mr. Fish,\r\nhowever, held his ground with great courage and ability, insisting that\r\nthe claims of every character should be disposed of by the Tribunal in\r\norder to remove them from the domain of further controversy and in\r\norder to establish perfect harmony in the relations of the two\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The filing of the counter cases and the argument.]\r\n\r\nBefore this discussion terminated the day arrived for the filing of the\r\ncounter cases. They were both {313} promptly filed with a reservation\r\nof all rights by each of the high contracting parties. The diplomatic\r\ndiscussion culminated in an attempt to make a supplemental treaty,\r\nwhich should provide that the Government of the United States should\r\nwithdraw its claims for national losses and indirect losses, on the\r\ncondition that no such losses should be claimed by either Government in\r\nthe future. But the day arrived for the filing of the arguments before\r\nanything was effected. The agent of the United States filed his\r\nargument on the day fixed, the 15th of June, but the British agent only\r\nfiled a statement setting forth the differences between the two\r\nGovernments in the interpretation of the Treaty in respect to claims\r\nfor national and indirect damages, and the late negotiations and\r\ndiscussions between the two Governments concerning these differences.\r\nThe British agent also expressed the hope that, if time were given,\r\nthese negotiations would prove fruitful, and asked the Arbitrators to\r\nadjourn for eight months.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Obstacles.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Decision of the Tribunal in regard to national and indirect\r\ndamages.]\r\n\r\nIt looked as if the work of the commissioners, who had framed the\r\nTreaty, and of the Arbitrators, who had now given six months of their\r\ntime to its execution, would go for naught, and that the Governments\r\nand the people of the two countries would be thrown back into the\r\nrelations existing during the years 1869 and 1870, with intensified\r\nfeelings of hostility. The Arbitrators realized the seriousness of the\r\nsituation and did not yield to the request of the British agent. They\r\nadjourned to the 19th of the month, that is for four days only, in\r\norder to deliberate upon the proposition. When they reassembled on the\r\n19th the President of the Tribunal announced that the Arbitrators had\r\ndecided to inform the two high contracting parties, at that {314}\r\njuncture, that the Arbitrators did not consider the claims for national\r\nand indirect damages to be a good foundation in international law \"for\r\nan award of compensation or computation of damages between nations;\"\r\nbut were unanimously of the opinion that such claims should \"be wholly\r\nexcluded from the consideration of the Tribunal in making its award,\r\neven if there were no disagreement between the two Governments as to\r\nthe competency of the Tribunal to decide them.\" The President said\r\nfurther, that the Arbitrators made this announcement in order that the\r\nGovernment of the United States might consider if it would adopt some\r\ncourse in reference to these claims, which would relieve the Tribunal\r\nfrom deciding upon the request of the British agent for an adjournment.\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States was duly informed of this\r\nannouncement by the Tribunal, and, upon the advice of the learned\r\ncounsel for the United States, he instructed the agent of the United\r\nStates to make the following reply to the Tribunal:\r\n\r\n\"The declaration made by the Tribunal, individually and collectively,\r\nrespecting the claims presented by the United States for the award of\r\nthe Tribunal for, first, the losses in the transfer of the American\r\ncommercial marine to the British flag, second, the enhanced payment of\r\ninsurance, and, third, the prolongation of the war and the addition of\r\na large sum to the cost of the war and the suppression of the\r\nRebellion, is accepted by the President of the United States as\r\ndeterminative of their judgment upon the important question of public\r\nlaw involved.\"\r\n\r\nThis reply was read to the Tribunal on the 25th of June, and on the\r\n27th the British agent, under instructions from his Government,\r\nwithdrew his request for an adjournment and filed his argument.\r\n\r\n{315} It was supposed by the Americans that the whole case on both\r\nsides was now in, and that, unless the Arbitrators should require\r\nfurther argument or statement in reference to specific points, the\r\nTribunal would now proceed to make its decisions. But the British\r\ncounsel and the British agent immediately petitioned the Tribunal to be\r\nallowed to prepare and present another argument, and to have six weeks'\r\ntime in which to do it, and even the member of the Tribunal appointed\r\nby the British Government exerted himself to secure this delay and this\r\nnew opportunity for the British agent and his counsel. The Tribunal\r\nfelt, however, that it was in possession of the evidence and the\r\nargument necessary for determining the question before it, and refused\r\nthe request.\r\n\r\nThe Tribunal now adjourned to the 15th of July, in order to give its\r\nmembers time and opportunity to study the cases. On the 15th, the\r\narbitrators reassembled and invited the agent and counsel of each of\r\nthe high contracting parties to sit with them in their conferences. To\r\nall others, however, the doors were closed. They spent some two days\r\ndiscussing the order of the procedure which they should follow, and\r\nfinally adopted the order proposed by Mr. Staempfli, and also indicated\r\nin the Treaty itself, which was to take up the case of each vessel\r\nseparately, and allow each Arbitrator to express a provisional opinion\r\nupon it, which opinion, however, should not be conclusive even on the\r\nArbitrator himself who gave it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The decision of the Tribunal in the case of the _Florida_.]\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of the month (July), the Tribunal proceeded to take up the\r\ncase of the _Florida_ and to hear the opinions of the Arbitrators upon\r\nit. Four of the five Arbitrators were of the opinion that the British\r\nGovernment had failed to exercise due diligence in the discharge of its\r\nneutral duties toward the United States in this case. Sir Alexander\r\n{316} Cockburn alone disagreed with this view. The four also held that\r\nthe tenders of the _Florida_ should follow the lot of their principal.\r\nThe reading of the opinion in the case of the _Florida_ was finished on\r\nthe 22d, and the Tribunal adjourned to the 25th.\r\n\r\nUpon the reassembly of the arbitrators, Baron d'Itajubá called on the\r\nBritish counsel for a statement or an argument on the questions of due\r\ndiligence, and of the effect of commissions held by Confederate war\r\nvessels which had entered British ports, and of the legitimacy of coal\r\nsupplies to Confederate vessels in British ports. Of course the counsel\r\nof the United States would be permitted to reply.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The decision in the case of the _Alabama_.]\r\n\r\nThe Tribunal approved the proposition, and then proceeded to the case\r\nof the _Alabama_. The Arbitrators agreed unanimously in their views of\r\nthis case, holding the Government of Great Britain guilty of a lack of\r\ndue diligence. The case of the tender to the _Alabama_ was viewed in\r\nthe same light.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The decision in the case of the _Shenandoah_, and other\r\nvessels.]\r\n\r\nThe Tribunal then took up the case of the _Shenandoah_. The Arbitrators\r\nwere unanimously of the opinion in this case that the British\r\nGovernment had not failed in due diligence anterior to the time when\r\nthe vessel entered the port of Melbourne. On the other hand, three of\r\nthe Arbitrators, Count Sclopis, Mr. Adams and Mr. Staempfli, held that\r\nthe British Government was responsible for all the acts of this vessel\r\ncommitted after leaving Melbourne.\r\n\r\nIn regard to all the other vessels mentioned in the case of the United\r\nStates, excepting only the _Retribution_, the Arbitrators were\r\nunanimous in the opinion that the British Government had not failed in\r\ndue diligence in the discharge of its duties as a neutral, and in\r\nregard {317} to the _Retribution_ three of the five Arbitrators held\r\nthe like opinion. After hearing the additional arguments called for,\r\nthe Tribunal closed the doors on the 26th of August, and, without the\r\npresence even of agents or counsel, deliberated upon the momentous\r\nquestions submitted to it. On the 9th of September the decision was\r\nadopted. The Tribunal then adjourned to the 14th, upon which day the\r\ndecision was to be proclaimed to the world.\r\n\r\nThe public session of the Tribunal on the 14th was a solemn and an\r\nimposing affair with nothing to mar the satisfaction of those who\r\nparticipated in it, except the discourtesy of Sir Alexander Cockburn,\r\nwho not only kept the assembly waiting for his appearance long past the\r\nappointed hour, but departed with unseemly haste at the close of the\r\nvaledictory pronounced by the president, Count Sclopis.\r\n\r\nThe award followed the line of the opinions already recited. It\r\nconvicted the British Government of a lack of due diligence in the\r\ndischarge of its neutral duties in the cases of the _Alabama_ and the\r\n_Florida_ and their respective tenders, and also in the case of the\r\n_Shenandoah_ from the time she left the port of Melbourne, but\r\nexonerated it in all other cases.\r\n\r\nThe award also repeated the decision announced by Count Sclopis, on the\r\n19th of June, excluding the claims for national and indirect damages,\r\nand then fixed the amount due to the United States from Great Britain\r\nin the gross sum of \"fifteen millions five hundred thousand dollars in\r\ngold, as the indemnity to be paid by Great Britain to the United States\r\nfor the satisfaction of all the claims referred to the consideration of\r\nthe Tribunal.\" Sir Alexander Cockburn refused to sign the award, and\r\nfiled a statement of his reasons for his dissent. The other four\r\nmembers of the Tribunal signed {318} it, and as the majority rule had\r\nbeen provided for in the Treaty, both of the high contracting parties\r\nwere duly bound, and so regarded themselves.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: International principles settled by the Geneva Tribunal.]\r\n\r\nAs to principles decided by the entire procedure of the commissioners\r\nand of their Governments in the formation of the Treaty, and of the\r\nArbitrators in making the award, we may say, first, that all questions\r\nof damages resulting from the lack of due diligence on the part of a\r\nneutral in the fulfilment of the duties of neutrality were regarded as\r\nproper subjects for arbitration, and that the determination of the\r\nquestion whether the claims presented, or any of them, are a good\r\nfoundation for an award of compensation was also regarded as a proper\r\nquestion for arbitration; second, that due diligence to be exercised by\r\nneutral governments is diligence \"in exact proportion to the risks to\r\nwhich either of the belligerents may be exposed from a failure to\r\nfulfil the obligations of neutrality on their part\"; third, that the\r\nfact that a commission was only subsequently given by a belligerent to\r\na vessel constructed, equipped or armed for the belligerent in the port\r\nof the neutral does not heal the violation of the duties of neutrality\r\nby the neutral in not using due diligence to prevent such construction,\r\nequipment or armament in its ports; fourth, that the privilege of\r\nex-territoriality accorded to vessels of war can never be appealed to\r\nfor the protection of acts done in violation of neutrality; fifth, that\r\nno neutral can excuse itself from the due discharge of the duties of\r\nneutrality on account of imperfections in its own laws and government;\r\nand sixth, that the cost to the belligerent of pursuing vessels, which\r\nhave been enabled to operate against the belligerent on account of the\r\ndereliction of the neutral, and all indirect loss resulting therefrom,\r\ndo not constitute a \"good foundation for an {319} award of compensation\r\nor computation of damages between nations.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Northwest boundary question.]\r\n\r\nTwo other questions of great importance were placed in course of\r\nsolution by the Treaty of Washington. One was the contention between\r\nthe two high contracting parties concerning the boundary line between\r\nthe United States and British Columbia from the point where the\r\nforty-ninth parallel of north latitude intersects the middle of the\r\nchannel which separates the continent from Vancouver's Island to the\r\nPacific Ocean. The contention on the part of Great Britain was that\r\nthis line should run, according to the stipulations of the Treaty of\r\nJune 15th, 1846, through the Rosario Straits, and on the part of the\r\nUnited States that it should run through the Canal de Haro. The high\r\ncontracting parties agreed, in the thirty-fourth article of the Treaty\r\nof Washington, to submit this question to the arbitration and award of\r\nHis Majesty the German Emperor, whose decision thereon should be final\r\nand without appeal. The German Emperor, William I., accepted this duty;\r\nand on the 21st of October, 1872, announced his award, upholding the\r\ncontention of the United States.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Fisheries question.]\r\n\r\nThe other question was that which related to the common rights of\r\nfishing to be enjoyed by the citizens and subjects of the two high\r\ncontracting parties along the Atlantic coast. The eighteenth article of\r\nthe Treaty provided that the inhabitants of the United States should\r\nhave for the term of twelve years, in common with the subjects of Her\r\nBritannic Majesty, the right to take sea fish \"of every kind, except\r\nshell-fish, on the sea-coasts and shores, and in the bays, harbors, and\r\ncreeks, of the Provinces of Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick, and\r\nthe colony of Prince Edward's Island, and of the several islands {320}\r\nthereunto adjacent, without being restricted to any distance from the\r\nshore, with permission to land upon the said coasts and shores and\r\nislands, and also upon the Magdalen Islands, for the purpose of drying\r\ntheir nets and curing their fish.\" By article nineteenth the same right\r\nwas accorded to British subjects, in common with the citizens of the\r\nUnited States, along \"the eastern sea-coasts and shores of the United\r\nStates north of the thirty-ninth parallel of north latitude, and on the\r\nshores of the several islands adjacent thereunto, and in the bays,\r\nharbors and creeks of the said sea-coasts and shores of the United\r\nStates and of the said islands.\" Finally, by article twenty-first free\r\ntrade between Canada and Prince Edward's Island and the United States\r\nin the produce of their respective sea-fisheries was established.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Halifax commission and award.]\r\n\r\nThe contention on the part of Great Britain in regard to this subject\r\nwas that the rights and privileges accorded to the citizens of the\r\nUnited States by these articles were more valuable than those conceded\r\nto the subjects of Great Britain by the United States, and that a sum\r\nof money should be paid to Great Britain by the United States in offset\r\nthereof. The United States denied the British assumption, and the two\r\nhigh contracting parties agreed, in the twenty-third article of the\r\nTreaty, to leave this matter to the arbitration and award of three\r\ncommissioners, one to be appointed by the President of the United\r\nStates, one by Her Britannic Majesty, and a third by the President and\r\nthe Queen conjointly, provided they could agree upon a person within\r\nthree months from the date when the Treaty should take effect and, if\r\nnot, then by the Austro-Hungarian Ambassador at the Court of St. James.\r\n\r\nThe President named, as the representative of the United States, the\r\nHon. Ensign H. Kellogg. The Queen {321} appointed, as her\r\nrepresentative, Sir Alexander T. Galt. And the two high contracting\r\nparties not being able to agree upon the third member of the\r\ncommission, the Austro-Hungarian Ambassador to the Queen named Maurice\r\nDelfosse, the Belgian Minister Plenipotentiary to the United States.\r\nDelfosse had been proposed by the British Government to the Government\r\nof the United States as the third commissioner, and the President had\r\nobjected to him as being the representative of a country whose\r\ninterests were too nearly allied with those of Great Britain. It was\r\nnaturally understood by the President that this had disposed of\r\nDelfosse, and the Government at Washington was taken by surprise when\r\nthe Austro-Hungarian Ambassador at London, Count Beust, made it\r\nmanifest that he should name Mr. Delfosse. Mr. Fish, the Secretary of\r\nState, with true diplomatic instinct, immediately accommodated himself,\r\nhowever, to the situation, and congratulated Delfosse upon his\r\nappointment. Count Beust announced the choice of Delfosse on the 2d of\r\nMarch, 1877, nearly six years after the Washington Treaty was\r\nnegotiated and signed, during which period the fisheries of\r\nNewfoundland were brought under the same agreements as those of Canada,\r\nPrince Edward's Island, and the United States above the thirty-ninth\r\nparallel. The Commission finally met at Halifax in the latter half of\r\nthe year 1877 and on November 23d, 1877, made its award, sustaining by\r\na vote of two to one the contention of Great Britain, and adjudging\r\nthat the United States Government should pay the Government of Great\r\nBritain the sum of five millions five hundred thousand dollars in gold.\r\n\r\nThe representative of the United States, Mr. Kellogg, dissented from\r\nthe decision; and it was felt in the United States that the Government\r\nhad been overreached in the matter. Considerable delay in the {322}\r\npayment of the amount thus resulted, and some controversy over it with\r\nGreat Britain occurred. But finally, on November 21st, 1878, the draft\r\nfor the amount was delivered to the British Government by Mr. Welsh,\r\nthe Minister of the United States at the Court of St. James.\r\n\r\nTwo other events of an international character happened within the\r\ndecade between 1867 and 1877 to which brief reference should be made,\r\nviz., the Chinese Treaty of 1868, and the strong and persistent attempt\r\nof President Grant to bring Santo Domingo under the sovereignty of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Burlingame Treaty with China.]\r\n\r\nIn 1861 Anson Burlingame, a citizen of the United States and a resident\r\nof Massachusetts, was sent as Minister of the United States to China.\r\nHe was a diplomatist of much skill, and he succeeded in making such a\r\ndeep impression upon the Emperor of China that the latter, on his\r\nresignation as Minister of the United States to China in 1867, made him\r\nEnvoy Extraordinary from China to the United States and the European\r\nstates for the purpose of securing treaties of amity and commerce\r\nbetween China and the states of the civilized world. He came\r\nimmediately to the United States and negotiated with Mr. Seward, the\r\nSecretary of State of the United States, the Treaty of July 28th, 1868,\r\nwhereby freedom of emigration and immigration between China and the\r\nUnited States was established, upon the principle of the \"inherent and\r\ninalienable right of man to change his home and allegiance\" expressly\r\nsubscribed to by the United States and China in the Treaty; the\r\nresidence of Chinese consuls in the ports of the United States, with\r\nthe same privileges and immunities as the British and Russian consuls\r\nenjoyed in said ports, was agreed to; and freedom of religion for\r\ncitizens of {323} the United States in China, and Chinese converts to\r\nthe Christian religion in China, and for Chinese subjects in the United\r\nStates, was mutually pledged. This Treaty was heralded at the time as\r\nbeing an immense advance in bringing China into close sympathy with\r\nmodern civilization. But very soon the \"labor element,\" as it assumes\r\nto call itself, in the United States, began to find fault with the\r\nliberal provisions upon the subject of emigration and immigration, and\r\nhas succeeded in forcing the Government of the United States back from\r\nits ideal position to the old ground of national exclusiveness. The\r\nexample set by the United States has been accepted by the Chinese\r\nGovernment as a justification of its old methods, and as an excuse for\r\ndropping back into them in great measure.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The attempt to annex the Dominican Republic to the United\r\nStates.]\r\n\r\nAt the moment of General Grant's accession to the presidency there was\r\ncivil commotion in the Dominican Republic. Buenaventura Baez was the\r\nlegal President of the Republic, but he had lost the support of a very\r\nlarge proportion of the population, who were following a leader named\r\nCabral. Cabral and his party were so strong that Baez feared the\r\noverthrow of his government, and sought to avert it by proposing\r\nannexation to the United States.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Treaty.]\r\n\r\nIn July of 1869, President Grant sent General Orville E. Babcock to\r\nSanto Domingo with written instructions from the Secretary of State,\r\nMr. Fish, to inquire into the political situation there and into the\r\nvalue and resources of the country. Babcock, terming himself\r\naide-de-camp to the President of the United States, succeeded somehow\r\nor other in so impressing his importance and authority upon the willing\r\nBaez and his confederates as to move them to sign a treaty for the\r\nannexation of the Dominican Republic to the United States. It appears\r\nthat he pledged the {324} President of the United States to use\r\nprivately all his influence with the members of Congress for the\r\nratification of the Treaty.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Treaty before the Senate.]\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of January, 1870, President Grant sent this proposed Treaty\r\nto the Senate for ratification. He must have thought that there would\r\nbe no difficulty in securing for it the approval of that body, for his\r\nmessage was only three lines in length and contained no argument. It\r\nwas referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and it soon became\r\nmanifest that a serious opposition to ratification was developing\r\nitself. The President now procured from the Dominican representative at\r\nWashington an agreement to an extension of the time for ratification,\r\nand in communicating this to the Senate on May 31st he went into an\r\nargument in support of the proposed treaty. He said, among other\r\nthings, that the acquisition of this country would cut off one hundred\r\nmillions of dollars' worth of the imports of the United States and\r\nlargely increase its exports, and would thus enable the United States\r\nto extinguish its large debt abroad; that it would give the United\r\nStates military command of the entrance to the Caribbean Sea and \"the\r\nIsthmus transit of commerce\"; and that it was necessary in order to\r\nmaintain the Monroe Doctrine. He declared that the inhabitants of Santo\r\nDomingo yearned \"for the protection of our free institutions and laws,\r\nand our progress and civilization.\" And he affirmed that he had\r\ninformation that a European Power was standing ready to offer two\r\nmillions of dollars for the possession of Samana Bay alone. It would be\r\ndifficult to find another message of a President of the United States\r\nwhich contained an equal amount of such extravagant nonsense.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Its rejection.]\r\n\r\nThe Committee on Foreign Affairs thoroughly sifted the subject, and\r\nrecommended that the proposed Treaty {325} be not ratified, and the\r\nSenate, despite the influence of the Administration, sustained the\r\nCommittee. This action of the Senate occurred on the 30th of June. The\r\nPresident was surprised, mortified and indignant. He was especially\r\nangry with the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Senator\r\nSumner, and was from that moment determined to oust Sumner from that\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The President's attempt to renew negotiations.]\r\n\r\nIn his next annual message, that of December 5th, 1870, he took up the\r\nmatter again, went over all of his old arguments expressed in even more\r\nextravagant language than before, and added the prophecy that if the\r\nUnited States did not take Santo Domingo, European nations would\r\nacquire the Bay of Samana and create there a great commercial city to\r\nwhich the United States would become tributary without receiving\r\ncorresponding benefits, and that then the folly of the rejection of so\r\ngreat a prize by the United States would be recognized. He then asked\r\nCongress to authorize him to appoint a commission to negotiate a treaty\r\nwith the authorities of Santo Domingo for its annexation to the United\r\nStates, and suggested that the treaty so negotiated might be ratified\r\nby a joint resolution of the two Houses of Congress, instead of by the\r\nSenate alone.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Committee of Inquiry.]\r\n\r\nThese recommendations and suggestions and the language in which they\r\nwere expressed were felt to be most exasperating by those Senators and\r\nRepresentatives who opposed the President's scheme, and the President's\r\nsupporters saw quickly that Congress would not sanction any such\r\nmeasure as he proposed. In place of it, Senator Morton, of Indiana,\r\noffered in the Senate a resolution to empower the President to appoint\r\na commission, composed of three persons, to go to Santo Domingo and\r\ninquire into the {326} political situation and the resources of the\r\ncountry. This resolution finally passed under strong opposition, and\r\nthe House of Representatives concurred in it with the proviso, which\r\nthe Senate accepted, that the resolution should not be construed as\r\ncommitting Congress in any manner or degree to the policy of annexing\r\nSanto Domingo to the United States.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The report of the commissioners.]\r\n\r\nThe President appointed as commissioners Benjamin F. Wade, Andrew D.\r\nWhite and Samuel G. Howe. These gentlemen proceeded to Santo Domingo,\r\nmade their inquiries, and furnished the President with a report\r\nsustaining his views and recommendations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The abandonment of the scheme.]\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of April, 1871, the President submitted this report to\r\nCongress, accompanied by a message which contained a justification of\r\nhis own conduct in the whole matter, and an attack upon those who\r\nopposed his policy of annexation, especially upon Senator Sumner. It\r\nwas a very undignified, not to say puerile, document, and ought never\r\nto have been written, much less sent. It revealed, however, the fact\r\nthat the President understood at last that he must abandon his pet\r\nscheme. He did it, however, with a very bad grace, and in his last\r\nannual message he repeated for the third time his old arguments in\r\nfavor of his miserable project, \"not,\" he said, \"as a recommendation\r\nfor a renewal of the subject of annexation,\" but in vindication of his\r\nconduct in regard to it. It is needless to add that none of his fearful\r\npredictions about European occupation of Santo Domingo, in case the\r\nUnited States should fail to seize it, and the destruction of the\r\nMonroe Doctrine, have come to pass. On the other hand, the Monroe\r\nDoctrine has attained an almost monstrous growth which at times appears\r\nas likely to threaten as to preserve the peace of the two {327}\r\nAmericas, and the poor little Dominican Republic, which was incapable\r\nof self-government, still exists and seems to be bettering its\r\ncondition by its own efforts, while the great European city in the Bay\r\nof Samana, to which the United States was to become tributary, has not\r\neven the substance of a mirage in the waters upon which the vast\r\nmarines of the world were to ride in approaching its docks and\r\nlandings. Such has been the fulfilment of the prophecy upon which was\r\nbased the supposed necessity of expansion beyond the seas!\r\n\r\n{328}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{329}\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nAbbott, Josiah G., on electoral commission, 286\r\n\r\nAdams, Charles Francis, joins liberal republicans, 264;\r\n  candidate for presidential nomination, 265;\r\n  returns from England, 303;\r\n  at Geneva arbitration, 311, 316\r\n\r\nAdams, John Q., nominated for vice-presidency, 267\r\n\r\nAlabama, in Lincoln's proclamation, 11;\r\n  electoral vote of 1864 rejected, 22;\r\n  reconstruction in, 37;\r\n  convention and election in, 38;\r\n  vote on thirteenth amendment, 55;\r\n  in the reconstruction bill, 112;\r\n  registration in, 146;\r\n  election in, 149;\r\n  disfranchisements in, 150;\r\n  voting on constitution, 151, 153, 197;\r\n  act on admission of members from, 198;\r\n  reconstruction declared complete, 202;\r\n  ratifies fourteenth amendment, 203, 204;\r\n  republicans get control in, 268, 269;\r\n  change in character of government, 273\r\n\r\n_Alabama_, the, case of, 316, 317\r\n\r\n_Alabama_ claims, 307, 308, 316, 317\r\n\r\nAlaska, purchase of, 299-302\r\n\r\nAlexandria, Va., Pierpont government at, 13, 224\r\n\r\nAlta Vela, matter of claim to, 177, 178\r\n\r\nAmes, Adelbert, resigns as governor of Mississippi, 275\r\n\r\nAnderson, T.
