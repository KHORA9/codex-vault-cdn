The work will\r\nbe published next year under the auspices of the Cartier Centenary\r\nCommittee in connection with the great commemorative celebration of the\r\none hundredth anniversary of Cartier's birth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR GEORGE ETIENNE CARTIER\r\n\r\nHis Work for Canada and His Services to Montreal.\r\n\r\n(AN ADDRESS DELIVERED BY MR. JOHN BOYD BEFORE THE\r\nCANADIAN CLUB OF MONTREAL, APRIL 7th, 1913.)\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Chairman and Gentlemen:\r\n\r\nThe subject of the address which I have the privilege of delivering\r\nto-day is \"Sir George Etienne Cartier, His Work for Canada and His\r\nServices to Montreal.\"\r\n\r\nLet me at the outset, Mr. Chairman, express my deep appreciation of the\r\nhonor the Executive of the Canadian Club has done me in inviting me to\r\naddress the members of this important and representative organization.\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1892, through the efforts of Mr. Charles R. McCullough of\r\nHamilton, the first Canadian Club was organized, a movement was\r\ninaugurated of the utmost importance to the Dominion. Every important\r\ncentre throughout the country now has its Canadian Club, and these\r\norganizations, or as they have been well termed, these \"universities\r\nof the people\" now numbering nearly one hundred, are doing a splendid\r\nwork in fostering a spirit of patriotism and in creating that national\r\nsentiment which is so essential to Canada's welfare. The Canadian Club\r\nof Montreal, composed as it is of the most representative citizens of\r\nthe commercial metropolis, has ever been foremost in this great work,\r\nand it is indeed a privilege to have the opportunity of addressing such\r\na gathering.\r\n\r\nWhat more appropriate subject, Mr. Chairman, could be found for an\r\naddress before a Canadian Club, than the career of one of our great\r\nnation-builders, of one who helped to lay the foundations of Canadian\r\nnationality and of the Dominion's greatness?\r\n\r\nIt is not my intention, Mr. Chairman, nor would time permit on this\r\noccasion, to deal exhaustively with the life and achievements of Sir\r\nGeorge Etienne Cartier. That is now engaging my attention in another\r\nform, and when the Memorial History of the Life and Times of George\r\nEtienne Cartier shall appear, it will, I trust be found to be at\r\nleast an exhaustive review of a great career and of one of the most\r\nmemorable periods of Canadian history. On this occasion, owing to the\r\nlimited time at my disposal, I shall content myself with reviewing\r\nsuccinctly Cartier's public career and achievements, dwelling briefly\r\non the lessons of his life with special emphasis upon the great work\r\nthat he did for Canada in general and the eminent services which he\r\nrendered to the City of Montreal in particular.\r\n\r\nI shall take it for granted, Gentleman, that you are all conversant\r\nwith the main facts of Cartier's career, from his birth at St. Antoine\r\non the Richelieu River on September 6th, 1814, until his entrance to\r\npublic life at the age of 34 in 1848, from that date until he became\r\nPrime Minister of United Canada in 1858, and from that until his death\r\nin 1873 when he held the portfolio of Minister of Militia and Defence\r\nin the Dominion Government.\r\n\r\nCartier's public career covered a period of some twenty-five years,\r\nthat is to say from 1848 to 1873. What fruitful efforts, what\r\nherculanean labors, what great achievements, what struggles, defeats\r\nand triumphs were crowded within the compass of that career! The period\r\nwhich it covered was one of the most remarkable, if not the most\r\nremarkable, in the whole range of Canadian history. It was a period\r\nwhich witnessed many great constitutional changes, many transformations\r\nof parties, many fierce political struggles. It saw the beginning and\r\nthe end of the Union, it marked the triumph of the long struggle for\r\nresponsible government, it witnessed the birth of Confederation. It was\r\na period fecund of great events and momentous developments, it was also\r\na period rendered notable by the long succession of great statesmen\r\nwhose names must forever be illustrious in Canadian history.\r\n\r\nDuring all of that period Cartier played an active part and at times\r\noccupied a pre-eminent position.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of his career, Cartier was a zealous reformer. In his\r\nyouth like so many other ardent spirits of the time he came under the\r\ninfluence of Louis Joseph Papineau, when that great French Canadian\r\ntribune, with his incomparable eloquence, was thundering against those\r\nadministrative abuses which were directly responsible for the troubles\r\nof the period. Nor was Papineau alone in his opposition to what Cartier\r\ndescribed as the action of a minority which sought to dominate the\r\nmajority and exploit the government in its own interests. Papineau,\r\nit should be remembered had the support of leading English-speaking\r\nCanadians, such as the distinguished Wolfred Nelson, afterwards Mayor\r\nof Montreal; in fact it is a noteworthy historical feature that some\r\nof the leading figures in the struggle for responsible government\r\nin Lower Canada were English-speaking. Cartier's participation in\r\nthe rising of 1837 was due to the ardor and impetuosity of youth and\r\nthe sincere convictions he held that the prevailing evils called for\r\ndrastic measures. His experience convinced him of the folly of an\r\nappeal to arms; he realized that the remedy for existing evils must be\r\nsought, not through armed resistance to the constituted authorities,\r\nbut through constitutional agitation and legislative action. He became\r\na staunch supporter of LaFontaine's policy, and one of his earliest\r\ncampaign speeches was made in advocacy of the principle of ministerial\r\nresponsibility during the crisis resulting from the resignation of\r\nthe LaFontaine-Baldwin Government in 1844. In 1848, when Cartier\r\nfirst entered Parliament, the struggle for responsible government,\r\nthanks to the efforts of those two great statesmen, Louis Hypolite\r\nLaFontaine and Robert Baldwin, whose names will forever be held in the\r\nhighest honor by all Canadians, had been fought and won. When justice\r\nhad been secured and existing abuses remedied by the granting of\r\nresponsible government, Cartier became, and ever afterwards continued\r\nto be one of the warmest supporters and most zealous champions of\r\nBritish institutions, a strong advocate of the maintenance of British\r\nconnection and a passionate lover of the British flag.\r\n\r\nCartier was the destined successor of LaFontaine in the great work of\r\nreconstruction, pacification, and conciliation, and when LaFontaine\r\nretired in 1851, and was followed a few years later by that other\r\neminent French-Canadian statesman, Auguste Norbert Morin, Cartier's\r\npath to the leadership of his native province was clear. For years he\r\nwas the undisputed leader: his voice, as has been well said, was the\r\nvoice of Quebec.\r\n\r\nThe struggle for responsible government having been won, an era of\r\nmarked industrial expansion and development followed under the Union.\r\nIt was an era of railway building, of canal construction, of the\r\nestablishment of great public works. Cartier, owing to his practical\r\nqualities, his great business abilities, his mastery of details, and\r\nhis administrative capacities, was eminently qualified to obtain\r\na leading position during such a period. He achieved distinction\r\nas a reformer, as an able administrator, as a legislator, and as a\r\nconstructive statesman. His name is attached to some of the most\r\nimportant Acts of a period prolific of important legislation. It\r\nis sufficient to mention in this connection such measures as the\r\nconstruction of the Montreal and Portland Railway, the decentralization\r\nof the judiciary, the codification of the civil laws and of civil\r\nprocedure, the modification of the criminal law, the Municipal Act of\r\nLower Canada, the Act relating to registration offices, the abolition\r\nof the seigniorial tenure, the choice of Ottawa as the Capital of\r\nCanada, the construction of the Grand Trunk Railway and the Victoria\r\nBridge, the organization of the educational system of Lower Canada, the\r\nimprovement and deepening of the St. Lawrence, the building of canals,\r\nthe union of the provinces of British North America, the acquisition\r\nof the North-West Territories, the construction of the Intercolonial\r\nRailway, the establishment of the Province of Manitoba, the admission\r\nof British Columbia into Confederation, the establishment of the\r\nmilitia system and the initiation of the Canadian Pacific Railway.\r\n\r\nIt would not be in accordance with that absolute truth which is\r\ndemanded of history, to even infer that to Cartier alone is due the\r\ncredit for the passage of all of these great measures. Many eminent\r\nmen contributed by their efforts to their achievement. But to Cartier\r\nmay fairly be adjudged the merit without detracting from the merits\r\nof others, of having taken an active part in the achievement of all\r\nof these important measures, of having devoted his great energies and\r\nabilities to their accomplishment, and of having played a determining\r\npart in the achievement of some of them. Some of these measures\r\nwere of material benefit to the progress of the country. The legal\r\nreforms for which Cartier is entitled to the sole credit, constitute\r\nin themselves a monument to his wise statesmanship. Other measures\r\nin which he played a determining part, such as Confederation, were\r\nof an epoch-making character, in connection with Canada's national\r\ndevelopment and well-being. As an eminent French-Canadian writer, the\r\nlate Senator Tassé, has well remarked, more than one of these measures\r\nwould have been sufficient to immortalize Cartier. He was, to use\r\nSenator Tassé's words, at one and the same time a legislator, a founder\r\nof constitutions, a peaceful conqueror.\r\n\r\n\r\nCartier and Confederation\r\n\r\nThe greatest work in which Cartier participated, and in which it\r\nis freely acknowledged he played a determining part, was of course\r\nthe establishment of Confederation. The idea of a union of all the\r\nprovinces of British North America did not originate with Cartier,\r\nany more than it originated with Macdonald, Tupper, Tilley, Brown or\r\nthe other great Fathers of Confederation. Proposals to that effect\r\nhad been made long before, and the idea was one that had arisen\r\nin many minds as a desirable consummation and as a remedy for the\r\nchaotic conditions which then prevailed. But the idea was one that was\r\nheartily supported by Cartier from a very early period, and to the\r\nCartier-Macdonald Government of which he became the head in 1858 as\r\nPrime Minister of United Canada must be given the credit of having\r\ntaken the first practical steps to bring about Confederation. One of\r\nthe items of that government's programme was the union of the British\r\nNorth American provinces, and soon after the close of the session\r\nof 1858, a delegation composed of three members of the Government,\r\nCartier himself, A. T. Galt, and John Rose went to England to press\r\nthe matter upon the Imperial Government. A memorandum submitted to the\r\nImperial authorities and signed by Cartier, Galt and Rose urged the\r\nImperial Government to take steps to have a meeting of delegates from\r\nall the British North American provinces to consider the question of\r\nConfederation and to report upon it.\r\n\r\nThough the steps taken in 1858 had no immediate result, the fact\r\nremains that the Government of which Cartier was the head, was the\r\nfirst to take up the question of the union of the British North\r\nAmerican provinces, that, as the lamented Thomas D'Arcy McGee remarked\r\nin his great speech during the Confederation debate \"the first real\r\nstage of the success of Confederation, the thing that gave importance\r\nto the theory in men's minds, was the memorandum of 1858, signed by\r\nCartier, Galt and Rose. The recommendation in that memorandum\" said\r\nMcGee, \"laid dormant until revived by the Constitutional Committee\r\nwhich led to the coalition, which led to the Quebec Conference, which\r\nled to the draft of the Constitution now on our table, and which\" added\r\nMcGee with assurance \"will lead, I am fain to believe, to the union\r\nof all these provinces,\"--an assurance, which was not long afterwards\r\nhappily fulfilled.\r\n\r\nCartier was the leader of the Quebec wing of the Coalition Ministry.\r\nHe was a delegate to the Charlottetown Conference, as well as a member\r\nof the Quebec Conference. He took a leading part in the Confederation\r\ndebates, ably defending the measure against the attacks made upon it.\r\nWith Macdonald, Brown and Galt he was deputed after the scheme had\r\nbeen adopted by the Legislature to go to England to confer with Her\r\nMajesty's Government; he was also one of the delegates who sat in\r\nConference from the 4th to the 24th December, 1866, at the Westminster\r\nPalace Hotel in London, and at which a series of 69 resolutions, based\r\non those of the Quebec Conference, were finally passed. The sittings\r\nof that famous conference were renewed early in January of 1867, a\r\nseries of draft bills were drawn up, and revised by the Imperial law\r\nofficers, a bill was submitted to the Imperial Parliament in February,\r\nand on March 29th, under the title of the British North America Act,\r\nit received the royal assent. A royal proclamation issued from Windsor\r\nCastle on May 22nd, 1867, appointed July 1st as the date upon which the\r\nAct should come into force, and the following first of July witnessed\r\nthe birth of what the Governor-General, Lord Monck, well designated as\r\n\"a new nationality\".\r\n\r\nThe men who assembled at Quebec on October 10th, 1864, to devise means\r\nfor bringing about the union of the British North American provinces,\r\nhad momentous problems to solve, but they were all men of the most\r\nardent patriotism, of the broadest views, and with a firm determination\r\nto carry to a successful issue the great work with which they had\r\nbeen entrusted. How they succeeded in their task we all know. It has\r\nbeen well remarked by one of the biographers of Sir John A. Macdonald\r\nthat there are three men besides Macdonald who in the establishment\r\nof Confederation and in securing the large results which followed\r\nfrom that epoch-making measure, demand special mention. Those men\r\nwere George Etienne Cartier, Charles Tupper, and Leonard Tilley.[1]\r\nJustice demands that George Brown should also be named amongst the\r\ngreat Fathers of Confederation, for without the co-operation of that\r\neminent Liberal statesman it is questionable whether Confederation\r\nunder the circumstances could have been effected at that time. It\r\nwas George Brown who made the proposals which rendered the coalition\r\nministry possible, and by sinking all party considerations and personal\r\ndifferences in a grave crisis of his country's history, he performed a\r\nsignal act of patriotism, which entitles his name to a high place on\r\nCanada's roll of honor. It was in fact a striking lesson in patriotism\r\nand in devotion to country, to find men like Macdonald and Cartier on\r\nthe one hand, and Brown on the other, forgetting all past differences\r\nand even bitter personal animosities, and sitting at the same council\r\nboard to devise means by which the public interests might be served\r\nat a most critical juncture. Nor, amongst the leading Fathers of\r\nConfederation must Sir A. T. Galt be forgotten, for that distinguished\r\nstatesman was a most zealous advocate of Confederation, holding that\r\nunless a union was effected, the provinces would inevitably drift\r\ninto the United States. During the parliamentary session of 1858 he\r\nstrongly advocated the federal union of all the British North American\r\nprovinces, and as has been justly said, the resolutions which Galt then\r\nmoved in favor of such a union, entitle him to a high place amongst the\r\npromoters of Confederation[2].\r\n\r\nOf the thirty-two statesmen who assembled at Quebec in 1864 and framed\r\nthe Quebec resolutions which formed the basis of Confederation, but one\r\nsurvives to-day, and the Cartier Centenary movement has the privilege\r\nof having that great statesman whose name will forever be linked with\r\nthe names of Macdonald and Cartier, as its patron. Still hale and\r\nhearty in his 92nd year, Sir Charles Tupper enjoys the veneration\r\nand esteem of all Canadians. It has been justly said by Sir John A.\r\nMacdonald's biographer, that in the \"reconciliation of Nova Scotia to\r\nConfederation; in carrying out a great expensive and hazardous railway\r\npolicy; in the establishment of a national fiscal system; in making\r\nCanadian expansion compatible with complete allegiance to the Empire,\r\nthe aid which Macdonald received from Sir Charles Tupper, can scarcely\r\nbe exaggerated. In him great natural ability and power as a platform\r\nspeaker were united with a splendid optimism about his country, a\r\ncourage that feared nothing, and a resoluteness of purpose which\r\ndespised any obstacles with which he could be confronted.\"[3]\r\n\r\nIt is not minimizing the services of any of the other illustrious\r\nFathers of Confederation, to say that Cartier played a leading, in\r\nfact a determining part, in the achievement of that measure. His great\r\ncolleagues have generously testified to the pre-eminent services which\r\nhe rendered at that time.\r\n\r\n\"Cartier was as bold as a lion. He was just the man I wanted: but for\r\nhim Confederation should not have been carried,\" was the emphatic\r\ndeclaration made by Sir John A. Macdonald on the day when he unveiled\r\nthe statue of his great colleague at Ottawa.\r\n\r\nSir Charles Tupper's tribute is equally eloquent and emphatic. \"I have\r\nno hesitation,\" he says, \"in saying that without Cartier there would\r\nhave been no Confederation, and therefore Canada owes him a debt that\r\ncan never be repaid.\"\r\n\r\nDr Parkin in his life of Sir John A. Macdonald, in the \"Makers of\r\nCanada\" series, also pays a just tribute to Cartier for his work in\r\nconnection with Confederation when he says: \"Without Cartier's loyal\r\nhelp, it would scarcely have been possible, when the effort for union\r\ncame, to allay the anxiety of the French-Canadians lest they should be\r\nswallowed up, and their individuality be lost in the large proposed\r\nconfederacy.\"\r\n\r\nCartier's position at that time, it must be remembered, was an\r\nextremely difficult one, in fact, it is the difficulties which he\r\nthen encountered and the manner in which he triumphed over them, that\r\nentitled him to all the more credit. \"Never did a French-Canadian\r\nstatesman\" as an eminent French-Canadian writer has remarked, \"have to\r\nface a greater responsibility than that which Cartier assumed the day\r\nwhen he had the alternative of accepting or refusing Confederation.\r\nNeither Papineau nor LaFontaine had to place in the balance such grave\r\nissues. Their role was reduced to demanding liberty for Canadians.\r\nCartier had to choose between a problematical future and a recognized\r\nstate of affairs, with well defined advantages. Would as many\r\nguarantees be found in the edifice which was to be constructed? By\r\naccepting the confederation of the provinces, was it not leaving the\r\ncertain for the uncertain? Such were the questions which agitated minds\r\nanxiously weighed.\"[4]\r\n\r\nThere was strong opposition to Confederation in Quebec as well as\r\nin other provinces. Cartier had to face the powerful attacks of\r\nredoubtable and able antagonists who maintained that Confederation\r\nwould be detrimental to the interests of the French-Canadians. His\r\ncontention was that with general interests entrusted to a central\r\ngovernment and local interests to local legislatures, the rights of\r\nthe French-Canadians would be amply safeguarded. Cartier maintained\r\nhis position in the face of the most determined opposition and even\r\nagainst bitter personal attacks. He had his vindication when in the\r\nelections of 1867 the people of Quebec returned him to Parliament with\r\na triumphant following.\r\n\r\nAnd has not the course of events since Confederation vindicated the\r\nposition which Cartier then took? The French-Canadians have not only\r\nenjoyed the fullest freedom in the direction of provincial affairs,\r\nbut they have played a large and important part in the public life\r\nof Canada, a French-Canadian has occupied the exalted position of\r\nPrime Minister of the Dominion, and no matter whether they agree\r\nwith his policy or not, all fair-minded Canadians must admit that\r\nSir Wilfrid Laurier personally filled that great office with the\r\nutmost distinction, with credit to himself and to his country. Under\r\nConfederation there has been friction at times due in most cases to\r\ndemagogic appeals to popular passion and racial feeling, but the sound\r\ncommon sense of the mass of the people has always asserted itself,\r\nand the governmental and legislative machinery has been found elastic\r\nenough to meet ever increasing demands.\r\n\r\nA notable tribute was recently paid to Cartier and the other great\r\nFathers of Confederation by that distinguished British statesman,\r\ndiplomat, and author, Right Hon. James Bryce, when in addressing this\r\nClub a few weeks ago he said: \"Not less remarkable than your material\r\nprogress has been the growth of your constitutional government,\r\nalthough in its early days there were not wanting people to show that\r\nCanada could never be a great nation. Your federal system has worked\r\non the whole with wonderful success and with little friction. It has\r\nworked perhaps better than anywhere else in the world; I think the\r\nonly example of equal success is that of Switzerland. You have had the\r\ngreat problem of two races living side by side, of peoples different in\r\nrace and language, whom the federal system was designed to unite, while\r\nthe federation of districts so dissimilar as the province of British\r\nColumbia, the prairies, and the Maritime Provinces shows that as far\r\nas adaptation to local conditions is concerned the federal system has\r\nbeen an unqualified success. And this success is a tribute to the\r\ncapacity of the men who have governed as well as to those who framed\r\nthe constitution.\"\r\n\r\nThe successful working of the federal system in Canada to which Mr.\r\nBryce bore testimony, is another striking proof of the wise and\r\nfar-sighted statesmanship of Cartier and the other public men who\r\nframed our constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Great Measures\r\n\r\nConfederation having been accomplished, Cartier's energies were\r\ndirected to measures for the strengthening and defence of the national\r\nfabric. He was largely instrumental in determining the route of the\r\nIntercolonial Railway, and in having that road, which it is admitted\r\nhas been a most important factor in consolidating the Dominion,\r\ncompleted. One of the most important measures of Cartier's public\r\ncareer, was undoubtedly the one which, as Minister of Militia and\r\nDefence, he presented to Parliament on March 31st, 1868, and which\r\nprovided for the organization of the Canadian Militia, a measure that\r\nis the basis of our whole militia system.\r\n\r\nConfederation, as you know, originally included only the four provinces\r\nof Quebec, Ontario, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. It was the desire\r\nof Cartier, as it was that of Macdonald, to see established a united\r\nCanada, stretching from the Atlantic to the Pacific, a great maritime\r\nas well as land power with the furthest east united to the furthest\r\nwest by a great transcontinental railway system. When the union of\r\nthe four provinces had been accomplished, Cartier was steadfast in\r\nhis efforts to secure the accomplishment of the larger idea. He fully\r\nrealized the possibilities of the great West and the importance of\r\nsecuring for the Dominion that vast territory, the development of which\r\nhas been the marvel of the past quarter of a century. Largely through\r\nhis efforts, the great western territory now forming the Provinces\r\nof Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, was secured from the Hudson's\r\nBay Company on most advantageous terms. When we realize that this\r\nimmensely rich territory, the \"granary of the Empire\" was acquired\r\nfor the Dominion for the insignificant sum of $1,500,000, largely\r\nthrough the negotiations which Cartier conducted in England, some idea\r\nof the importance of the services he rendered in that connection,\r\nmay be formed. Cartier also framed the bill creating the Province of\r\nManitoba, which he presented and had passed at the session of 1871.\r\nOnly one thing was needed to round out Confederation, and that was\r\nthe admission of British Columbia. In the negotiations which resulted\r\nin the admission of that great Province into the Dominion, Cartier\r\nplayed a leading part, and it was he, who on November 28th, 1871,\r\npresented the bill to Parliament providing that British Columbia should\r\nbecome a portion of the Dominion. On that occasion Cartier hailed the\r\nrealization of his dream of a united Canada extending from ocean to\r\nocean, with pardonable pride.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot close my explanations,\" he declared, \"without impressing\r\non the honorable members the greatness of the work. This young\r\nConfederation is on the point of extending over the whole northern\r\nportion of the continent, and when we consider that it took our\r\nneighbors sixty years to extend to the Pacific, where will be found\r\nin the history of the world anything comparable to our marvellous\r\nprosperity? I have always maintained that a nation to be great must\r\nhave maritime power. We possess maritime power in a high degree. Our\r\nunion with the maritime provinces gives us a seaboard on the east, and\r\nnow our union with British Columbia will give us a seaboard on the\r\nwest.\"\r\n\r\nWith the admission of British Columbia to Confederation, the dream\r\nof Cartier and of Macdonald, of a united Canada extending from ocean\r\nto ocean, was realized. But one thing more was required to bind the\r\nscattered provinces firmly together-a great transcontinental railway.\r\nCartier was one of the strongest advocates of such an undertaking,\r\nand to him belongs the glory of having had passed the first charter\r\nfor the Canadian Pacific Railway. One of the terms of the union of\r\nBritish Columbia with Canada under the Act presented by Cartier, was\r\nthe construction of such a road. It is related that the delegates of\r\nBritish Columbia during the negotiations urged upon Cartier that a\r\nrailway should be built across the Prairies to the foot of the Rockies,\r\nand that a colonization road should be laid out from the foot of the\r\nRockies to the Coast. \"No,\" replied Cartier, \"that will not do; ask for\r\na railway the whole way and you will get it.\" Some leading public men\r\nof the time thought that Cartier was willing to undertake too great\r\nan obligation, but events have more than justified his optimism. At\r\nthe session of 1872, Cartier presented resolutions providing for the\r\nconstruction of the Canadian Pacific. After a remarkable debate, a\r\nbill based on the resolutions was adopted, and Cartier, springing to\r\nhis feet, gave utterance amidst loud cheers to the expression which has\r\nbecome historic: \"All aboard for the West.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the last great triumph of his public career. He did not live to\r\nsee the realization of his dream, for it was not until thirteen years\r\nafterwards, that is to say, on November 7th, 1885, that the last spike\r\nof the main line of the Canadian Pacific Railway was driven by Sir\r\nDonald Smith, now Lord Strathcona, at Craigellachie, a small village\r\nof British Columbia, and on July 24th, 1886, Cartier's great colleague\r\nand fellow-worker for a united Canada, Sir John A. Macdonald personally\r\nreached the Pacific by rail from Ottawa.\r\n\r\nThough Cartier did not live to see the completion of the gigantic\r\nundertaking which meant so much for Canada, it is one of his chief\r\nmerits that he was one of its initiators and strongest supporters, and\r\nthat he foresaw and foretold its great future.\r\n\r\n\"Before very long\", he declared, addressing Parliament, \"the English\r\ntraveller who lands at Halifax will be able in five or six days to\r\ncover half of the continent inhabited by British subjects.\"\r\n\r\nHow Cartier's prophecy has been fulfilled we all know. The traveller\r\nlanding to-day at Halifax can reach Victoria by means of the Canadian\r\nPacific in less than six days. The Canadian Pacific Railway Company has\r\nbecome one of the greatest corporations in the world, operating not\r\nonly a great transcontinental railway, and a chain of palatial hotels,\r\nbut also possessing magnificent fleets on the Atlantic and the Pacific,\r\nwith its vessels now encircling the globe. It has progressed stage by\r\nstage until under the able direction of its present distinguished head,\r\nSir Thomas Shaughnessy, it has attained the greatest position in its\r\nhistory. The company's expansion has in fact been one of the marvels\r\nof history, and with the continued development of the Dominion, its\r\nachievements, great as they have been, will undoubtedly be surpassed\r\nin the future. Cartier, by his strenuous advocacy of the construction\r\nof the road in days when faith in the future was at a discount, gave\r\nanother evidence of his great foresight as well as of his faith in the\r\nfuture of the Dominion which he did so much to establish.\r\n\r\n\r\nCartier and Macdonald\r\n\r\nNo review of Cartier's career, however summary, would be complete\r\nwithout some reference to the alliance that existed between him and\r\nthat other great Canadian statesman, Sir John A. Macdonald, an alliance\r\nwhich was for a long period a most important factor in the public\r\nlife of Canada. In his great painting \"The Fathers of Confederation,\"\r\nthe artist Harris most appropriately places Macdonald and Cartier\r\nconspicuously in the centre of the group, and the names of those two\r\ngreat statesmen must forever be linked in connection with that epoch\r\nmaking measure.\r\n\r\nMacdonald and Cartier began their public careers within a few years\r\nof each other, Macdonald being first returned to Parliament in 1844,\r\nwhile Cartier became a member in 1848. The two men first became\r\nclosely associated as members of the same Government, the MacNab-Taché\r\nMinistry, formed in 1855, in which ministry Macdonald held the\r\nportfolio of Attorney-General for Upper Canada while Cartier was\r\nProvincial Secretary, the first public office he held. From that time\r\nuntil the day of Cartier's death, the association between the two\r\nmen remained practically unbroken. Their alliance, as has been well\r\nsaid, was based on equal consideration for the rightful claims of both\r\nnationalities.\r\n\r\nEach of the two men had qualities not possessed by the other.\r\nMacdonald had a magnetic personality, he was a consummate tactician,\r\nan incomparable leader of men. He had that genius which enables its\r\npossessor to seize and make the most of an opportunity. He had that\r\nquality so indispensable in a great leader of gaining the loyal and\r\ndevoted support of men of widely different characters and temperaments.\r\nMacdonald in short combined the grasp of a statesman with the arts of a\r\npolitician. Cartier excelled as an administrator, he was a tireless and\r\nindefatigable worker who never spared himself and who expected others\r\nto follow his example. He studied and analyzed all subjects which he\r\nhad to handle to the very bottom, and when he came to discuss them he\r\nhad a complete mastery of all the details. He was strong, nay, even\r\ndogmatic, in his convictions; once his mind was made up he pursued\r\nthe path he had marked out for himself with persistent determination,\r\nheedless of all obstacles in his way. To his followers his word was\r\nlaw, and he exacted from them an unswerving obedience. His energy was\r\nprodigious: he deserved the designation given to him by Gladstone when\r\nthat great statesman said that Cartier was \"_un homme qui semble être\r\nlégion_\",--a man who was a legion in himself. Cartier's was essentially\r\na strong and determined character.\r\n\r\nIt was of course impossible that men of such different temperaments as\r\nMacdonald and Cartier and representing often such divergent interests,\r\nshould not have their differences sometimes, but whatever differences\r\nthey may have had never interfered with the high personal esteem and\r\nregard they entertained for each other.\r\n\r\nAt a great banquet given in his honor by the Bar of Toronto on February\r\n8th, 1866, Macdonald took occasion to pay a warm and generous tribute\r\nto his French-Canadian colleague who was one of the guests of honor.\r\n\r\n\"I wish to say,\" declared Macdonald, \"that Hon. Mr. Cartier has a right\r\nto share in the honors which I am receiving to-night, because I have\r\nnever made an appeal to him or to the Lower Canadians in vain. There\r\nis not in the whole of Canada a heart more devoted to his friends. If\r\nI have succeeded in introducing the institutions of Great Britain, it\r\nis due in great part, to my friend, who has never permitted under his\r\nadministration that the bonds which attach us to England should be\r\nweakened.\"\r\n\r\nCartier was equally generous in appreciation of his great colleague.\r\nSpeaking at a banquet tendered Macdonald by the citizens of Kingston on\r\nSeptember 6th, 1866, Cartier said:\r\n\r\n\"Kingston is indeed a favored city, for it has for its representative\r\na statesman who has never yet been surpassed in Canada, and who\r\nprobably never will be in the future. I have had the happiness of being\r\nassociated with the member for Kingston in my public career, and of\r\nhaving formed with him an alliance which has already lasted longer\r\nthan all alliances of this kind in Canada. The success which we have\r\nobtained together has been due to the fact that we have repelled all\r\nsectional feelings and sought what might benefit Canada as a whole.\"\r\n\r\nThat was the keynote of the Cartier-Macdonald alliance, the\r\nsubordination of all sectional and racial feeling to the welfare of\r\nCanada as a whole. Cartier throughout his long public career was\r\nessentially a peacemaker, who always strove to promote a better feeling\r\nbetween the two races. A striking testimony to the success of his\r\nefforts in that direction was given on one occasion in Parliament when\r\nMr. Benjamin, a leading Ontario member, declared: \"I cannot refrain\r\nfrom acknowledging that Mr. Cartier has done more to unite the two\r\nraces and to re-establish harmony between them, than any other member\r\nof the House.\"\r\n\r\nWell shall it always be for the Dominion, if its public men, no matter\r\nto what political party they may belong, always adhere to the sane\r\nand true principles upon which the Macdonald-Cartier alliance was\r\nbased--mutual toleration and good-will, respect for the rights of all,\r\nthe co-operation of races, the safeguarding of Canada's autonomy, and\r\nthe development of Canadian nationality. The Macdonald-Cartier alliance\r\nin fact symbolized that union which should always exist between\r\nEnglish-speaking and French-speaking Canadians. And why should there\r\nnot be union? What matters it whether we speak different languages or\r\nworship at different altars, if we always remember that we are all\r\nCanadians, mutually interested in the welfare and aggrandizement of our\r\ncommon country. That was the spirit which actuated both Cartier and\r\nMacdonald during their long association, and it will be well if such a\r\nspirit always prevails in the Dominion. It is only, in fact, upon such\r\na basis that the permanence of Confederation, of which Macdonald and\r\nCartier were the principal architects, can be assured.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor Canadian Nationality\r\n\r\nThe aim of Macdonald, Cartier, and the other great Fathers of\r\nConfederation, was to establish broad and deep the foundations of a\r\nCanadian nationality, based on the broadest principles of justice,\r\ntolerance, and equal rights. All their public utterances during\r\nthe Confederation negotiations, testify to this fact. Macdonald's\r\nconception was that as the Dominion progressed it would become, to use\r\nhis own words, year by year less a case of dependence on our part, and\r\nof overwhelming protection on the part of the Mother Country, and more\r\na case of healthy and cordial alliance, that instead of looking upon\r\nus as a merely dependent colony, England would have in us a friendly\r\nnation--a subordinate but still a powerful people--to stand by her in\r\nNorth America in peace or war.\r\n\r\nIt is given to some men to have a vision that foresees the future\r\nand enables them to provide for momentous developments. Both Cartier\r\nand Macdonald were such men. It is in fact the supreme merit of\r\nCartier that whilst always standing firmly for the rights of his\r\nFrench-Canadian compatriots, his vision was not confined to the\r\nProvince of Quebec. If any one does, Cartier deserves the distinction\r\nof being known as a great Canadian. There was nothing narrow or\r\nprovincial in his views. His idea was a united Canada, stretching\r\nfrom ocean to ocean, in which men of all races, languages and creeds\r\nshould work together as brethren for the welfare and advancement of\r\ntheir common country. Cartier's desire was that his French-Canadian\r\ncompatriots should not confine their attention to the Province of\r\nQuebec, but should take their full share in the life of the Dominion,\r\nthat they should above all rejoice in the name \"Canadian,\" be proud of\r\nthe great Dominion and work for its welfare in co-operation with their\r\nEnglish-speaking fellow countrymen.\r\n\r\n\"Objection is made to our project,\" says Cartier, in his great speech\r\nduring the Confederation debates, \"because of the words 'a new\r\nnationality'. But if we unite we will form a political nationality\r\nindependent of the national origin and religion of individuals. Some\r\nhave regretted that we have a distinction of races and have expressed\r\nthe hope that in time this diversity will disappear. The idea of a\r\nfusion of all races is utopian, it is an impossibility. Distinctions\r\nof this character will always exist, diversity is the order of the\r\nphysical, moral and political worlds. As to the objection that we\r\ncannot form a great nation because Lower Canada is principally French\r\nand Catholic, Upper Canada English and Protestant, and the Maritime\r\nProvinces mixed, it is futile in the extreme.\r\n\r\n\"Take for example the United Kingdom, inhabited as it is by three great\r\nraces. Has the diversity of races been an obstacle to the progress and\r\nthe welfare of Great Britain? Have not the three races united by their\r\ncombined qualities, their energy and their courage, contributed to the\r\nglory of the Empire, to its laws of wise, to its success on land, on\r\nsea, and in commerce?\r\n\r\n\"In our Confederation there will be Catholics and Protestants,\r\nEnglish, French, Irish and Scotch, and each by its efforts and success\r\nwill add to the prosperity of the Dominion, to the glory of a new\r\nConfederation. We are of different races, not to quarrel, but to work\r\ntogether for our common welfare. We cannot by law make the differences\r\nof race disappear, but I am convinced that the Anglo-Canadian and the\r\nFrench-Canadian will appreciate the advantages of their position. Set\r\nside by side like a great family, their contact will produce a happy\r\nspirit of emulation. The diversity of race will in fact, believe me,\r\ncontribute to the common prosperity.\"\r\n\r\nWhat words of wisdom! What a spirit of true patriotism, of justice\r\nand of toleration they breathe! If Cartier in fact had never made any\r\nother utterance than this, it would be sufficient to stamp him as a\r\ntrue patriot and wise statesman. It will be well for Canada if such are\r\nalways the guiding principles of its national life.\r\n\r\nWhile the idea of Macdonald and Cartier and the other great Fathers\r\nof Confederation was, as has been said, to establish a Canadian\r\nnationality, none the less was it their intention to perpetuate British\r\ninstitutions on the North American continent, to establish, to use\r\nMacdonald's expression, a friendly nation, enjoying, it is true, the\r\nmost complete autonomy, but at the same time in alliance with Great\r\nBritain and the other portions of the Empire. No stronger believer\r\nin British institutions as the repository of freedom; no more ardent\r\nadmirer of the British flag as the symbol of justice and liberty could\r\nbe found than Cartier. In all his utterances during the Confederation,\r\ndebates, he took special pains to emphasize that Confederation was\r\nintended not to weaken, but to strengthen, the ties between the\r\nDominion, Great Britain and the other portions of the Empire.\r\n\"Confederation,\" he said, in one of his speeches on the measure, \"has\r\nfor its first reason our common affection for British institutions, its\r\nobject is to assure by all possible guarantees, their maintenance in\r\nthe future.\"\r\n\r\nFor the British flag Cartier on all occasions expressed a passionate\r\ndevotion.\r\n\r\n\"The Canadian people,\" he said at a great banquet given in his honor in\r\nLondon in 1869, \"desires to remain faithful to the old flag of Great\r\nBritain, that flag which waves over all seas, which tyranny has never\r\nbeen able to overcome, that flag which symbolizes true liberty\".\r\n\r\nThese words expressed Cartier's deep and earnest conviction. During\r\nhis several visits to Great Britain, he was deeply impressed by\r\nthe greatness of British institutions. On those occasions he was\r\nthe recipient of signal marks of honor; he was the personal guest\r\nof Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle for some time, and he received\r\nmarked attention from Gladstone, Lord Lytton, and other distinguished\r\nBritish statesmen. His services in connection with the establishment\r\nof Confederation, as you know, were recognized by the conferring of a\r\nbaronetcy upon him by Queen Victoria.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARTIER'S WORK FOR MONTREAL\r\n\r\nHaving reviewed the great work which Cartier did for Canada in general,\r\npermit me to emphasize the eminent services which he rendered to\r\nMontreal. It is doubtful whether many Montrealers of the present\r\ngeneration fully realize the importance of Cartier's services to this\r\ncity, and for that reason this portion of his career should be of\r\nspecial interest to citizens of this great metropolis.\r\n\r\nFrom 1861 until 1872, Cartier was one of the representatives of\r\nMontreal, first in the Parliament of United Canada, and afterwards\r\nin the House of Commons. During a portion of that period, he also\r\nrepresented Montreal-East in the Quebec Legislature under the system\r\nof dual representation which prevailed for some time following the\r\nestablishment of Confederation. Montreal's interests were always dear\r\nto Cartier's heart, and throughout his long public career he zealously\r\nstrove to promote the welfare and development of this city.\r\n\r\nReference has already been made to the interest which Cartier showed\r\nfrom the outset of his career in railway construction. He realized that\r\nin order that Montreal might attain an unrivalled position, it would\r\nbe necessary that railway communications should be established, that\r\nthe St. Lawrence channel should be deepened, and that canals should be\r\nconstructed and improved. One of the earliest of his speeches of which\r\nwe have record was delivered at a great mass-meeting of the citizens\r\nof Montreal, held in 1846, on the Champ de Mars, to promote the\r\nconstruction of the Montreal & Portland Railway to connect Montreal and\r\nPortland. Cartier on that occasion declared that such an undertaking\r\nwas a truly national work. Alluding to the fact that property in such\r\ncities as Buffalo, Boston, New York, Philadelphia and Baltimore, which\r\nhad become great railway terminals, had as a result greatly increased\r\nin value, he declared that the same thing would happen in the case of\r\nMontreal if adequate railway facilities were established.\r\n\r\n\"The prosperity of Montreal,\" he said, \"depends upon its position as\r\nthe great emporium for the commerce of the West, and we can only assure\r\nthat prosperity by better means of transport from the waters of the\r\nWest to the Atlantic by our canals and railways.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he became a member of Parliament Cartier continued his agitation\r\nfor adequate railway facilities, and one of the first speeches he\r\ndelivered in the legislature of United Canada, February 15th, 1849, was\r\nin advocacy of the completion of the Montreal & Portland Railway.\r\n\r\n\"There is no time to lose in the completion of the road,\" said Cartier\r\non that occasion, \"if we wish to assure for ourselves the commerce of\r\nthe West. All the cities of the Atlantic Coast are disputing for that\r\ncommerce.\"\r\n\r\nReferring to the efforts being made by New York, Philadelphia,\r\nBaltimore, and other American cities to capture this commerce, Cartier\r\nsaid: \"In seeing the efforts that an intelligent population is making,\r\nwe cannot doubt the importance of the trade of the lakes which they\r\ncovet and the profits which will result. Now, we may secure the greater\r\npart of that trade by constructing this road as soon as possible.\"\r\n\r\nAt another great mass meeting of the citizens of Montreal, held at the\r\nBonsecours Market on July 31st, 1849, at which resolutions were adopted\r\nfavoring the completion of the Montreal & Portland Railway, on motion\r\nof Cartier, seconded by John Rose, it was resolved that the city should\r\ntake shares in the company. Cartier on that occasion made a fervent\r\nappeal that the interests of Montreal should be considered.\r\n\r\n\"I do not fear to say,\" he declared, \"that Montreal will be recreant\r\nto its best interests, and will be the most backward of cities if it\r\nneglects the means that is offered it to reclaim a prosperity which\r\nis now leaving it. I appeal to the large proprietors, to the small\r\nproprietors who make the prosperity of the large ones, and to the\r\nindustrial and working classes which make the prosperity of both. We\r\nhave an exceptional chance to attract foreign capital. The city has\r\nonly to guarantee a bagatelle compared to the enormous debts contracted\r\nby the smaller cities of the United States to attract capital which\r\npasses through the hands of tradesmen and workingmen, to relieve trade\r\nwhich is languishing. It is an advantage which will be enjoyed even\r\nbefore the work is completed.\"\r\n\r\nCartier pointed out that New York had contracted a debt of $25,000,000\r\nto provide proper railway facilities, as it had sufficient faith in\r\nitself and in the spirit of enterprise of its citizens to discount the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n\"The time has come,\" said Cartier, addressing the citizens of Montreal,\r\n\"to belie your reputation as apathetic men without energy and without a\r\nspirit of enterprise. Let those terms cease to be applied to the name\r\n'Canadian'. This great meeting is one of the first to be held in a city\r\nof the British Provinces to encourage an enterprise of this importance.\r\nIt is proper that the example should come from Montreal, the commercial\r\nhead of British America. It should show itself worthy of its position.\r\nLet us arouse ourselves, let us agitate.\"\r\n\r\nCartier had the vision to foresee the great future in store for\r\nMontreal, if adequate transportation facilities were provided.\r\n\r\n\"Montreal,\" he prophetically declared on the same occasion, \"is\r\ndestined to become the great emporium for the West. Without railways\r\nand canals it will be impossible for it to attain the glorious position\r\nwhich will make it one of the principal cities of the continent.\"\r\n\r\nLargely as the result of Cartier's persistent efforts, the Montreal\r\n& Portland Railway which for a long time was the only outlet during\r\nthe winter for Canadian produce, destined for Europe, was completed,\r\nand inaugurated in 1851, being subsequently absorbed by the Grand\r\nTrunk Railway Company. Before the completion of this road, it must be\r\nremembered that there were only some seventy miles of railway in all\r\nCanada, the first road, the Laprairie and St. John's having been opened\r\nonly a few years before, that is to say on July 21st, 1836. When we\r\nconsider that to-day the total mileage of railways in Canada is 35,000\r\nmiles, that last year our combined railways built 1,970 miles of new\r\nrailway, on which was spent $30,000,000, and that the programme for\r\nthis year provides for 2,700 miles of new track, costing $41,000,000,\r\nsome idea may be obtained of the advance that has been made. Cartier\r\ndeserves the credit of having been one of the first to realize the\r\nimportance of railway construction in connection with the development\r\nof the country and of having been one of the strongest supporters of\r\na forward policy in this respect--a policy to which we owe the three\r\nsplendid railway systems we have to-day--the Canadian Pacific, the\r\nGrand Trunk, and the work of those two great railway men, Sir William\r\nMackenzie and Sir Donald Mann--the Canadian Northern.\r\n\r\nOne of Cartier's chief claims to honor is that it was he who secured\r\nthe incorporation of the Grand Trunk Railway Company, which has done so\r\nmuch for the development of Canada in general, and the City of Montreal\r\nin particular. Cartier always took the greatest pride in that fact. In\r\na speech delivered in the legislature he declared that he regarded the\r\nconstruction of the Grand Trunk as the greatest benefit that had ever\r\nbeen conferred on the country. \"I had charge of the Act which created\r\nthe Grand Trunk Railway,\" he added, \"and I am prouder of that than of\r\nany other action of my life.\" The Grand Trunk at the outset of its\r\nhistory had many difficulties, financial and otherwise, to encounter,\r\nand it was due to Cartier's efforts in a large measure, that the\r\ncompany was able to tide over these difficulties and that its success\r\nwas assured.\r\n\r\nReviewing his public career at a great banquet given in his honor by\r\nthe citizens of Montreal, on October 30th, 1866, on the eve of his\r\ndeparture for London as one of the Confederation delegates, Cartier\r\nreferring to the efforts he had made on behalf of the Grand Trunk\r\nsaid: \"In 1852-53, encouraged by the Hincks-Morin Ministry, I asked\r\nfor the incorporation of the Grand Trunk Railway Company, and I had it\r\nvoted despite the most furious opposition. I also had the construction\r\nof the Victoria Bridge voted. You will recall the prejudices there\r\nwere against that measure. It was a work which would produce floods\r\nin Montreal, it was a means to divert commerce towards Portland. But\r\nthe prejudice, against these great measures were soon dissipated, it\r\nwas only a passing tempest. It was so, too, for the Grand Trunk and\r\nthe Victoria Bridge. The Grand Trunk and the Victoria Bridge have\r\nflooded Montreal with an abundance of prosperity. What would Montreal\r\nbe without the Grand Trunk? It has assured for us the commerce of the\r\nWest.\"\r\n\r\nAddressing the electors of Montreal-East when seeking re-election in\r\n1867, Cartier, referring to the construction of the Victoria Bridge,\r\nsaid: \"You know that there existed considerable jealousy or rivalry\r\nbetween Quebec and Montreal, and that the two cities sought at the same\r\ntime to secure the possession of a bridge across the river. I will not\r\nstop to discuss the advantages of such a bridge. Thanks to my efforts\r\nI am proud to be able to say Montreal finally secured it. Montreal\r\nhas the Victoria Bridge. The results you know. Our city since then has\r\nhad a considerable development which Confederation, I am certain, will\r\nincrease.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the important factor that the Grand Trunk Railway\r\nCompany has been in the development of Eastern Canada, and what its\r\nassociate company, the Grand Trunk Pacific, will be in the opening up\r\nand development of rich new districts in the West, it will be realized\r\nthat Cartier in the part he played in the creation and assistance of\r\nthis great railway system, rendered another most important service to\r\nCanada.\r\n\r\nSt. Lawrence navigation and the advancement of the Port of Montreal\r\nfound in Cartier a steadfast advocate, and the Allan Line which was\r\nthe pioneer in ocean navigation via the St. Lawrence, secured from him\r\nthe heartiest encouragement and support. Speaking in the Legislative\r\nAssembly in 1860, in favor of a proposal to increase the mail subsidy\r\nto the Allans, Cartier warmly supported means to increase navigation by\r\nthe St. Lawrence. It was humiliating, he declared, to see nearly all\r\nour imports arriving by the steamships, the railways, and the canals\r\nof the United States. \"Let us rise,\" he said, \"to the height of the\r\nchanges wrought by progress, for we are at the beginning of a new era\r\nwhich will eclipse anything we have yet seen.\" The improvement of the\r\nharbor and port of Montreal always found in Cartier a zealous advocate,\r\nas he fully realized how important it was for Montreal's progress and\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\nCartier persistently advocated the enlargement of the canals, so as to\r\ndivert the commerce of the West from American ports to this port, and\r\nthus benefit the City of Montreal. In a speech on the deepening of Lake\r\nSt. Peter, delivered in the Parliament of United Canada on May 11th,\r\n1860, he said: \"Up to the present all our debt has been contracted\r\nfor the execution of very important public works--the Welland Canal,\r\nthe St. Lawrence Canal, the Rideau Canal, the Lachine Canal, etc. But\r\nwe have not yet attained our object, which is to divert the commerce\r\nof the great lakes from the American routes to the St. Lawrence. This\r\ncommerce continues to pass by New York and Pennsylvania, and all that\r\nwe see is the traffic destined for Ogdensburg and Oswego. What means\r\nshould be taken to remedy this condition of affairs? We have come to\r\nthe conclusion to abolish all tolls on the canals, and to make the St.\r\nLawrence route perfectly free from the ocean to the great lakes.\"\r\n\r\nIn reply to a remark by George Brown that the measure seemed to be\r\ndesigned to attract the commerce of the West to Montreal, to the\r\ndetriment of Upper Canada, Cartier said: \"I do not see why it should\r\nbe apprehended that Montreal will secure so many advantages from this\r\namelioration. This city is at the head of navigation, and is the\r\nprincipal centre of commerce; it is inspired by the spirit of progress,\r\nand I believe that in place of jealousy, all should be proud of its\r\nsuccess. Whatever they can do, they can never prevent its being the\r\nmost important city of the country, and from becoming a rival of the\r\ngreat American cities.\"\r\n\r\nReference has been made to the prominent part that Cartier took in\r\nadvocating the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway; and in\r\ndesiring to see the accomplishment of that great undertaking, he had\r\nan eye to the interests of Montreal. In a speech to the electors of\r\nMontreal-East on August 8th, 1872, he promised that Montreal would\r\nbe the principal terminus of that great road. \"I have,\" he said, to\r\nthe citizens of Montreal on that occasion, \"devoted all my efforts to\r\nfurther your interests and I have always desired that Montreal should\r\nhave the lion's share.\"\r\n\r\nThe mercantile and business interests always found in Cartier a\r\nfriend, in fact had he not been a public man, it is likely that his\r\ninclinations would have made him a great business man.\r\n\r\n\"Merchants,\" he said, speaking at a dinner tendered him by the\r\nmerchants of Quebec, on December 23rd, 1869, \"contribute greatly to the\r\nprogress of the country. Without the English merchants, England could\r\nnot have kept its possessions in the world. Like Rome she would have\r\nlost her Colonies soon after their conquest. But the English merchant\r\nwas the means of forming bonds between the new possessions of the\r\nEmpire. I respect the interests of those here present. Those interests\r\nhave greatly contributed to render Canada prosperous. Those who devote\r\nthemselves to commerce form in every country one of the most important\r\nclasses of society.\"\r\n\r\nCartier's efforts on behalf of the mercantile interests of Montreal,\r\nand his faith in the future of this city never wavered, and he\r\npredicted its great expansion in wealth and population.\r\n\r\n\"Our city,\" he said, addressing the electors of Montreal-East in 1867,\r\n\"now counts 150,000 souls. In twenty years under Confederation, I\r\npredict that it will have more than 250,000 inhabitants.\"\r\n\r\nHow Cartier's faith in Montreal has been justified, we all know. What\r\nwas at the time he spoke a town of 150,000 people, has become a great\r\nmetropolis of over 600,000 souls, and it is destined to have before\r\nmany years a population of over one million people. As Montrealers we\r\nare all, as we have a right to be, proud of the great position which\r\nthe city has attained, and of the still greater future which awaits it.\r\nLet us, in its day of greatness not forgot those, like Cartier, who in\r\nthe days of small things foresaw the great future before Montreal and\r\ngave their best efforts to promote its interests.\r\n\r\nTo the very end of his public career, Cartier's interest in the welfare\r\nof Montreal and his efforts to promote its advancement continued. His\r\nown words conveyed but the simple truth when he said in one of his last\r\naddresses, to his fellow citizens: \"I frankly avow that all that my\r\nheart inspires, all that my knowledge and experience furnish, have been\r\ndevoted to the welfare and prosperity of my compatriots in general and\r\nof Montreal in particular.\"\r\n\r\nLike many other statesmen, Cartier experienced the vicissitudes, as\r\nwell as the triumphs, of public life. His last appeal to the electors\r\nof Montreal, made when he was practically a dying man, resulted, owing\r\nto a combination of circumstances, in his crushing defeat. He was\r\ngreeted not with bouquets but with stones, from people of a city for\r\nwhich he had worked so hard, and for the advancement of which he had\r\ndone so much. Another seat was found for him in Provencher, Manitoba,\r\nbut his public career was over. In an effort to secure the restoration\r\nof his health he went to England, but the hope was vain: the incessant\r\nlabors of a long public career had broken down a naturally robust\r\nconstitution, and the great statesman passed away in London, England,\r\non May 23rd, 1873. His last thoughts were for his beloved country.\r\n\r\n\"Say to his friends in Canada,\" wrote one of his daughters in a\r\ntouching letter announcing his death to a friend in Montreal, \"say to\r\nhis friends in Canada that he loved his country to the last, that his\r\nonly desire was to return. Two days before his death he had all the\r\nCanadian newspapers read to him. Even his enemies, I hope, will not\r\nrefuse to admit that before all he loved his country.\"\r\n\r\nThe national mourning that followed the announcement of his death, the\r\nenconiums pronounced by the newspapers of all shades of opinion, the\r\neulogies delivered in Parliament, the scene of his labors for so many\r\nyears, and the imposing public funeral that was given his remains in\r\nMontreal, all bore eloquent testimony to the fact that the Canadian\r\npeople, regardless of party, recognized that in his death Canada had\r\nindeed lost one who before all had loved his country. His remains rest\r\nbeneath the soil of Mount Royal, which overlooks the city that he loved\r\nso well, and for the interests of which he worked so hard.\r\n\r\n\r\nLessons of Cartier's Life\r\n\r\nWhat were the lessons of Cartier's life? They may be summed up in the\r\nthree words--patriotism, duty, and tolerance. He loved his country and\r\nsought to promote its interests, he wore himself out in the discharge\r\nof his public duties, he was a man of the broadest views and the utmost\r\ntolerance. As Sir Adolphe Routhier has well remarked, to most public\r\nmen public life is a career, but for Cartier it was an apostolate,\r\na patriotic mission, and to fulfill that mission he sacrificed\r\neverything, even the modest fortune of which his family had need.[5]\r\n\r\nA French-Canadian and proud of his origin, a Roman Catholic and true\r\nto his faith, strong in his convictions, Cartier at the same time was\r\na man of generous sympathies, of broad views, and great tolerance. His\r\ncharity was broad enough to include men of all races, languages, and\r\ncreeds. \"My policy, and I think it best,\" he said on one occasion,\r\n\"is respect for the rights of all.\" Actuated by that spirit he stood\r\nfirmly on all occasions where there was justification for the rights\r\nof minorities, whether French or English, Catholic or Protestant. At\r\nthe time of Confederation, for instance, some fear was expressed that\r\nthe interests of the Protestant minority of Quebec would be jeopardized\r\nunder the new constitution. Cartier pledged his word that nothing of\r\nthe kind would happen. \"I have already had occasion to proclaim in\r\nParliament,\" he said, addressing the citizens of Montreal, \"that the\r\nProtestant minority of Lower Canada have nothing to fear from the\r\nProvincial Legislature under Confederation. My word is given, and I\r\nrepeat that nothing will be done of a nature to injure the principles\r\nand the rights of that minority.\"\r\n\r\nCartier's pledge, it is needless to say, has been sacredly kept.\r\n\r\nOn the same occasion, Cartier showed his largeness of views by\r\ndeclaring: \"You know that I am a Catholic. I love my religion,\r\nbelieving it the best, but whilst proudly declaring myself a Catholic,\r\nI believe it my duty as a public man to respect the sincerity and the\r\nreligious convictions of others. I am also a French-Canadian. I love my\r\nrace. I of course have for it a predilection which is assuredly only\r\nnatural, but as a public man and as a citizen, I also love others.\"\r\nSuch were Cartier's guiding principles throughout life.\r\n\r\nCartier, like all other human beings, had his faults, as well as\r\nhis virtues, his public career was not without its mistakes, but\r\nnobody ever questioned his ardent love for his country, his absolute\r\nsincerity, his high sense of honor, his personal honesty and integrity,\r\nhis fearless energy, and the firmness with which he always stood for\r\nhis convictions. His motto \"_Franc Et Sans Dol_\"--\"Frank And Without\r\nDeceit,\" well describes the character of the man.\r\n\r\nDid time permit, Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, a great deal more\r\nmight be said of Cartier and his works. But has not sufficient been\r\nsaid to justify the contention that Cartier was a great Canadian, a\r\nnation-builder in the truest sense of that term, one whose memory\r\nis entitled to lasting honor from all Canadians? Does not the\r\nsummary record of his career, which has been given, amply justify\r\nthe declaration of the great Lord Dufferin that Cartier's name must\r\nforever be indissolubly incorporated with the most eventful and most\r\nglorious epoch of his country's history, commencing as it did with his\r\nentrance into political life and culminating in that consolidation of\r\nthe Provinces to which his genius, courage and ability so materially\r\ncontributed.\r\n\r\nMacdonald, Cartier, Tupper, Tilley, Brown, Galt, and the other great\r\nFathers of Confederation builded better even than they knew. As the\r\nresult of their wise statesmanship and patriotic efforts, Canada\r\nto-day stands a young giant amongst the peoples of the world. Under\r\nConfederation there has been witnessed a marvellous expansion and an\r\nunprecedented prosperity. We have to-day, to use the words of one of\r\nthe most patriotic of our national poets, John Daniel Logan,--we have\r\nto-day a land:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Blessed with youth and strength, with health and peace.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd great as is the position of the Dominion at present, it is\r\ninsignificant to what it will be if Canadians are only true to the\r\nteachings of the Fathers, if they all work together for the common\r\nwelfare, if they are true to the national interests of the Dominion,\r\nand guard their great heritage against all influences of an insidious\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n\r\nHonor Cartier's Memory\r\n\r\nCanadians do well to honor the memories of those great men who laid\r\nbroad and deep the foundations of Canadian nationality, and who\r\naccomplished great works for the welfare of the Dominion. In the\r\nleading cities of Canada, stately monuments attest the recognition of a\r\ngrateful people of the services of that great Father of Confederation,\r\nand that illustrious Canadian statesman, Sir John A. Macdonald. Brown\r\nand Tilley, too, have their monuments. Sir Charles Tupper is still\r\nhappily with us in person, and I am sure that we all trust that his\r\nlife may long be spared. His name will always be remembered as that of\r\none of the leading Fathers of Confederation and one of our greatest\r\nstatesmen.\r\n\r\nDoes not justice demand that fitting honor should be done to that other\r\ngreat Father of Confederation, Sir George Etienne Cartier, by the\r\nerection of a memorial in the city which he represented in Parliament\r\nfor so many years, and for whose interests he strove so zealously?\r\n\r\nWhen in November, 1910, at a meeting held at the St. Jean Baptiste\r\nMarket Hall in this city, it was proposed by Mr. E. W. Villeneuve, now\r\npresident of the Cartier Centenary Committee, whom we have with us\r\nto-day, that the centenary of Cartier's birth should be appropriately\r\ncommemorated and that steps should be taken for the erection of a\r\nmonument to his memory, the proposal was enthusiastically taken up.\r\nSince then the movement has assumed not only a national but an Empire\r\nscope, and representatives of every portion of the Empire will be\r\npresent at the commemorative celebration next year. The movement, it\r\nmay be mentioned is absolutely non-partisan in character, it being\r\nrecognized that Cartier's memory is a national possession. The Prime\r\nMinister of the Dominion, Right Hon. R. L. Borden; the leader of the\r\nLiberal Party, Sir Wilfrid Laurier; the Prime Minister of the Province\r\nof Quebec, Sir Lomer Gouin; the Prime Ministers of all the Provinces;\r\nleading Liberals as well as Conservatives, throughout the Dominion,\r\nhave united to render homage to the memory of one who did so much\r\nfor Canada. Thanks to the co-operation and support of the Dominion\r\nGovernment and the Governments of all the Provinces, the erection of\r\na splendid memorial, which will stand on one of the slopes of Mount\r\nRoyal, and the first stone of which will be laid by His Royal Highness\r\nthe Duke of Connaught, on September 1st next, is now practically\r\nassured. The memorial, the work of the eminent Canadian sculptor, Mr.\r\nG. W. Hill, will not only serve to honor and perpetuate Cartier's\r\nmemory, but will also commemorate the establishment of Confederation,\r\nin which he played such a conspicuous part. In addition to the imposing\r\nstatue of Cartier the memorial will bear statues representing every one\r\nof the nine provinces of the Dominion, the whole symbolical of that\r\nUnited Canada, which was one of Cartier's cherished dreams.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the unveiling of the memorial, it is proposed to\r\nhold a series of commemorative celebrations, and it is confidently\r\nexpected that the citizens of Montreal, ever alive as they are to the\r\ninterests and reputation of the commercial metropolis, will give their\r\nhearty support and co-operation in making the celebration worthy not\r\nonly of the memory of the great statesman, but also of the leading city\r\nof the Dominion, with which he was so closely identified.\r\n\r\nAnd when, Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, on the 6th of September of\r\nnext year, the one hundredth anniversary of Cartier's birth, amidst\r\nthe plaudits of hundreds of thousands of Canadians of all origins,\r\ncreeds, and political leanings, the veil shall be removed from the\r\nmagnificent memorial which shall stand on one of the commanding slopes\r\nof Mount Royal, testifying to the grateful recognition of the whole\r\nDominion, justice shall have been done to the memory of one who loved\r\nhis country, who accomplished great works for its benefit, whose heart\r\nwas ever stirred by that feeling of ardent devotion to his native land\r\nwhich he himself expressed in those burning words of patriotism:\r\n\r\n\"_O Canada, Mon Pays, Mes Amours!_\"[6]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nO CANADA, MY OWN BELOVED LAND![7]\r\n\r\nFrom the French \"O CANADA, MON PAYS, MES AMOURS,\" of Sir George Etienne\r\nCartier.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY JOHN BOYD\r\n\r\nFor the Cartier Centenary.\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"One's own land is best of all,\"\r\n       So an ancient adage says;\r\n     To sing it is the poet's call,\r\n       Mine be to sing my fair land's praise.\r\n     Strangers behold with envious eyes\r\n       St. Lawrence's tide so swift and grand,\r\n     But the Canadian proudly cries,\r\n       O Canada, my own beloved land!\r\n\r\n     Rivers and streams in myriad maze\r\n       Meander through our fertile plains,\r\n     Midst many a lofty mountain's haze,\r\n       What vast expanse the vision chains!\r\n     Vales, hills and rapids, forest brakes--\r\n       What panorama near so grand!\r\n     Who doth not love thy limpid lakes,\r\n       O Canada, my own beloved land!\r\n\r\n     Each season of the passing year,\r\n       In turn, attractions hath to bless.\r\n     Spring like an ardent wooer, dear,\r\n       Besports fair flowers and verdant dress;\r\n     Summer anon prepares to wrest\r\n       The harvest rare with joyful hand;\r\n     In Fall and Winter, feast and jest.\r\n       O Canada, my own beloved land!\r\n\r\n     Canadians, like their sires of old\r\n       Revel in song and gaily live,\r\n     Mild, gentle, free, not overbold,\r\n       Polite and gallant, welcome give.\r\n     Patriots, to country ever leal,\r\n       They, foes of slavery, staunchly stand;\r\n     Their watchword is the peace and weal\r\n       Of Canada, their beloved land.\r\n\r\n     Each country vaunts its damsels fair,\r\n       (I quite agree with truth they boast)\r\n     But our Canadian girls must share\r\n       The witching charm of beauty's host,\r\n     So lovely they and so sincere,\r\n       With that French charm of magic wand,\r\n     Coquettish just to make them dear.\r\n       O Canada, my own beloved land!\r\n\r\n     O my country, thou art blest,\r\n       Favoured of all the nations now!\r\n     But the stranger's vile behest\r\n       Would the seeds of discord sow.\r\n     May thy brave sons for thy sake\r\n       Join to help thee, hand in hand,\r\n     For thy great day doth e'en now break,\r\n       O Canada, my own beloved land!\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Dr. Parkin--Life of Sir John A.

Cartier was for some time secretary of the St. Jean Baptiste\r\nAssociation which was founded by Ludger Duvernay in 1834, and it was\r\nat the first celebration of St. Jean Baptiste day held in Montreal in\r\n1835, that the song was sung for the first time by Cartier himself.\r\n\r\nAs the result of the indefatigable efforts of the president of the\r\nCartier Centenary Committee, Mr. E.

A brilliant success is assured for the Centenary\r\ncelebration, and the splendid memorial which will stand on one of the\r\nslopes of Mount Royal will forever commemorate the illustrious career\r\nof Cartier and the great work of Canadian Confederation with which he\r\nwas prominently identified.",
