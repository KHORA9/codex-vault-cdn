To\r\nthis end, the several measures are divided under three heads, namely,\r\nthose dealing with moral, with political and with industrial issues.\r\nInstead of scattering on all the measures introduced, or even a\r\nconsiderable part of them, the principal issue of each group, that which\r\nmeant the most to The People, and upon which the machine centered its\r\nefforts, has been selected for detailed consideration. On the score of\r\nthe moral issues, the Anti-Racetrack Gambling bill has been taken as the\r\nmost important; while the Direct Primary bill is dealt with as the chief\r\npolitical issue, and the railroad regulation measures as involving the\r\nchief industrial issue. The story of the fight over these bills is the\r\nstory of the session of 1909. The events attending the passage of the\r\nAnti-Racetrack Gambling bill, the amendment of the Direct Primary bill,\r\nand the defeat of the Stetson Railroad Regulation bill, with the\r\nattending incident of the passage of the Wright Railroad bill, show, as\r\nnothing else can, how the machine controls and manipulates a\r\nLegislature - and such is the purpose of this little volume.\r\n\r\nThe efforts of justice-loving men to simplify the criminal codes, to the\r\nend that rich and poor alike may have equal opportunity in the trial\r\ncourts - not in theory alone but in fact - and the successful efforts of the\r\nmachine to block this reform, have made detailed consideration of the\r\ndefeat of the Commonwealth Club bills and the passage of the Wheelan\r\nbills, and the so-called Change of Venue bill timely. And the story of\r\nthese measures illustrates again how the machine element defeats the\r\npurpose of The People, and overrides what are the constitutional\r\nrights - and should be rights in fact - of every American citizen.\r\n\r\nMeasures which involved no particular contest between the good\r\ngovernment and the machine forces - measures patched up by interested\r\nparties and slipped through the Legislature without opposition and\r\ngenerally without comment - although many of them of great importance, are\r\nnot touched upon. The histories of those selected for consideration show\r\nthe machine, or if you like, the system, at its work of passing\r\nundesirable measures, and of blocking the passage of good measures. If\r\nthe Story of the Session of the California Legislature of 1909 assist\r\nthe citizens of California to understand how this is done; if it give\r\nthem that knowledge of the weakness, the strength, the purposes, and the\r\naffiliations of the Senators and Assemblymen who sat in the Legislature\r\nof 1909, a knowledge of which the machine managers have had heretofore a\r\nmonopoly; if it point the way for a new method of publicity to crush\r\ncorruption and to promote reform - a way which others better prepared for\r\nthe work than I, may, in California and even in other States, follow - the\r\nlabor of preparing this volume for the press will have been justified.\r\n\r\nFranklin Hichborn.\r\n\r\nSanta Clara, Cal., July 4, 1909.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBreaking Ground.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Reform Element had a Majority in Both Senate and Assembly,\r\nGood Bills Were Defeated, and Vicious Measures Passed - Three Reasons for\r\nThis: (1) Reform Element Was Without Plan of Action, (2) Was Without\r\nOrganization; (3) The Machine Was Permitted to Organize Both Senate and\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe personnel of the California Legislature of 1909, was, all things\r\nconsidered, better than that of any other Legislature that has assembled\r\nin California in a decade or more. There were, to be sure, in both\r\nSenate and Assembly men who were constantly on the wrong side of every\r\nquestion affecting the moral, political or industrial well-being of the\r\nState, but a majority of each House labored for the passage of good\r\nlaws, laws which would not only silence and satisfy constituents, but\r\nprove effective and accomplish the purpose for which they had been\r\ndrawn. Just as earnestly as they worked for the passage of good laws, a\r\nmajority of the members of the Senate as well as a majority of the\r\nmembers of the Assembly opposed the passage of vicious measures, and of\r\nmeasures ostensibly introduced to work needed reform but drawn in such a\r\nmanner as to be, from a practical standpoint, ineffective.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, regardless of the purpose of this majority, the so-called\r\n\"Change of Venue\" [1] bill was passed, and the \"Judicial Column\" bill,\r\nintended to take the Judiciary out of politics, was denied passage. The\r\ninfamous \"Wheelan bills,\" aimed at the complication of the Grand jury\r\nsystem, went through both Houses, while the Commonwealth Club bills,\r\ndrawn to simplify the methods of criminal procedure, were held up and\r\neventually defeated. The ineffective Wright Railroad Regulation bill\r\nbecame a law, while the Stetson Railroad measure effective as finally\r\namended - was rejected. The provision in the Direct Primary bill for the\r\nselection of United States Senators by State-wide vote was stricken out,\r\nand the meaningless advisory, district vote plan substituted.\r\n\r\nCertainly, the accomplishment of the Legislature does not line with the\r\npurpose of a majority of its members. The voter is naturally asking why\r\nthe majority in both Houses standing for good legislation and opposing\r\nbad, accomplished so little; how it was that a minority, at practically\r\nevery turn, defeated a majority.\r\n\r\nThere were three principal reasons for this outcome.\r\n\r\n(1) The machine, as its name indicates, is a definite organization, with\r\nrecognized leaders. The anti-machine element was without organization or\r\nrecognized leaders.\r\n\r\n(2) The reform-advocating majority, except in the anti-racetrack\r\ngambling fight, was without definite plan of action. The majority was,\r\nfor example, for the passage of a direct primary law that would, first,\r\ntake the control of politics out of the hands of political bosses big\r\nand little, and, second, give the people of California the privilege of\r\nnaming their United States Senators, a privilege already enjoyed by the\r\npeople of the more progressive States of the Union. But the reform\r\nelement knew little or nothing of the details of direct primary\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\nThey were equally unprepared on other reform issues. They recognized the\r\nnecessity of passing an effective railroad regulation law, for example,\r\nbut had little or no conception of what the provisions of the measure\r\nshould be. They recognized that the criminal laws cannot be impartially\r\nenforced against rich and poor alike until the methods of criminal\r\nprocedure be simplified, put on a common sense basis. But even here they\r\nhad no definite policy and when told by machine claquers that the\r\nproposed reforms were revolutionary, even the most insistent of the\r\nreform element were content to let the simplifying amendments to the\r\ncodes die in committees or on the files.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the machine element, even before a member had reached\r\nSacramento, had their work for the session carefully outlined. This\r\nsession the bulk of the machine's work was negative; that is to say,\r\nwith a majority in both houses opposed to machine policies, the machine\r\nrecognized the difficulties of passing bad laws except by trick - and\r\nspent the session in amending good measures into ineffectiveness, or,\r\nwhere they could, in preventing their passage. Down to a comma the\r\nmachine leaders knew what they wanted for a direct primary law, for an\r\nanti-racetrack gambling law, for a railroad regulation law. From the\r\nhour the Legislature opened until the gavels fell at the moment of\r\nadjournment the machine element labored intelligently and constantly,\r\nand as an organized working unit, to carry its ends. There were no false\r\nplays; no waste of time or energy; every move was calculated. By\r\npersistent hammering the organized machine minority was able to wear its\r\nunorganized opponents out.[2]\r\n\r\n(3) The third reason for the failure of the reform majority is found in\r\nthe fact that the minority was permitted to organize both Senate and\r\nAssembly. In the Assembly the machine element named the Speaker without\r\nserious opposition. The Speaker named the Assembly committees. It\r\ndeveloped at the test that the important committees of the Assembly\r\nwere, generally speaking, controlled by the machine.\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant-Governor is, under the State Constitution, presiding\r\nofficer of the Senate, under the title of President of the Senate. But\r\nthe Senators elect the President pro tem., who, in the absence of the\r\nPresident, has the same power as the President. The reform element,\r\nalthough in the majority, permitted the election of Senator Edward I.\r\nWolfe as President pro tem. Wolfe was admittedly leader of the machine\r\nelement in the Senate. At critical times during the session, the fact\r\nthat both the President and President pro tem. of the Senate were\r\nfriendly to machine interests gave the machine great advantage over its\r\nanti-machine opponents.[3]\r\n\r\nThe reform majority in the Senate made the further mistake of leaving\r\nthe appointment of the Senate committees in the hands of\r\nLieutenant-Governor Warren Porter. Governor Porter flaunts his machine\r\naffiliations; is evidently proud of his political connections; indeed,\r\nin an address delivered before the students of the University of\r\nCalifornia, Porter advised his hearers to be \"performers\" in politics\r\nrather than \"reformers.\" It was not at all surprising, then, that the\r\nSenate committees were appointed, not in the interest of the reform\r\nelement, but of the machine. And yet, the reform element, being in the\r\nmajority, could have taken the appointment of the committees out of\r\nPorter's hands. In the concluding chapter it will be shown there is\r\nample precedent for such a course. But the reform element let the\r\nopportunity pass, and Warren Porter named the committees. Thus in both\r\nSenate and Assembly the strategic committee positions were permitted to\r\nfall into machine hands.\r\n\r\nThe importance of this on legislation can scarcely be over-estimated.\r\nUnder the system in vogue in California, the real work of a legislative\r\nsession is done in committee. When a bill is introduced in either House,\r\nit is at once referred to a committee. Until the committee reports on\r\nthe measure no further action can be taken. Thus a committee can prevent\r\nthe passage of a bill by deliberately neglecting to report it back to\r\nthe main body.\r\n\r\nWhen a measure passes either Senate or Assembly, it goes to the other\r\nHouse, and is once again referred to a committee. Again does the fate of\r\nthe bill hang on committee action. Thus, every measure before it can\r\npass the Legislature must, in the ordinary course of legislation, pass\r\nthe scrutiny of two legislative committees, either one of which may\r\ndelay its passage or even deny Senate or Assembly, or both, opportunity\r\nto act upon it.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, one of the rules of the Assembly of 1909 required that all\r\nbills referred to committees should be reported back within ten days,\r\nwhile the Senate rules provided that committees must act on bills\r\nreferred to them as soon as \"practicable,\" with the further provision\r\nthat a majority vote of the Senate could compel a report on a bill at\r\nany time. But these rules were employed to little advantage. In the\r\nAssembly, for example, the Commonwealth Club bills, referred to the\r\nJudiciary Committee on January 15, were not acted upon by the committee\r\nat all. These bills, in spite of the ten days' rule, remained in the\r\ncommittee sixty-seven days. The Direct primary bill was held up in the\r\nSenate Committee on Election Laws from January 8 until February 16, and\r\nat that late day came out of the committee with practically unfavorable\r\nrecommendation. It was noticeable that few, if any, important reform\r\nmeasures were given favorable recommendation by a Senate committee. Thus\r\nthe Anti-Racetrack Gambling bill, the Direct Primary bill, the Local\r\nOption bill, received the stamp of Senate committee disapproval. They\r\nwere returned to the Senate with the recommendation that they do not\r\npass. The same is largely true of the action of the Assembly\r\nCommittees.[4]\r\n\r\nIf machine-controlled committees could delay action on reform measures,\r\nthey could at the same time expedite the passage of bills which the\r\nmachine element favored, or which had been amended to the machine's\r\nliking. Thus the Change of Venue bill, which reached the Senate on March\r\n15, was returned from the Senate Judiciary Committee the day following,\r\nMarch 16, with the recommendation that it \"do pass.\" The Wheelan bills\r\nreached the Senate on March 17, and were at once referred to the\r\nJudiciary Committee. The Judiciary Committee that very day reported them\r\nback with favorable recommendation. Had they been delayed in the\r\ncommittee even 48 hours, their final passage would have been improbable.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, the Judiciary Committee was the one Senate committee\r\nwhose members President Porter did not name. Following a time-honored\r\ncustom, every attorney at law in the Senate was made a member of the\r\ncommittee. It so happened that ten of the nineteen lawyers in the Senate\r\nwere on the side of reform as against machine policies, eight generally\r\nvoted with the machine, while the nineteenth gave evidence of being in a\r\nstate of chronic doubt. This gave the reform element a majority of the\r\nSenate Judiciary Committee. But President Porter had the naming of the\r\nchairman of the committee, and the order of the rank of its members. The\r\nLieutenant-Governor's fine discrimination is shown by the fact that the\r\nChairman of the Committee and the four ranking members were counted on\r\nthe side of the machine.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly committees acted quite as expeditiously on measures which\r\nhad passed the Senate in a form satisfactory to machine interests. Thus,\r\nthe Wright Railroad Regulation bill, which reached the Assembly on March\r\n12, was reported back to the Assembly by the Assembly Committee on\r\nCommon Carriers the day following, March 13.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the reform majority unquestionably weakened its\r\nposition by permitting the machine minority to organize the Legislature.\r\nThis phase of the problem which confronts the State will be dealt with\r\nin the concluding chapter.\r\n\r\n[1] One of the best witnesses to the viciousness of this measure is\r\nGovernor Gillett, surely an unprejudiced observer. In giving his reasons\r\nfor vetoing the bill, Governor Gillett said:\r\n\r\n\"I have several reasons for saying that I will veto the bill. One reason\r\nis that I have always been opposed to it. When I was in the Senate in\r\n1897 I was against it and again in 1899 I fought it in the Judiciary\r\nCommittee. Two years ago I ignored another such measure that had passed\r\nthrough the Legislature, so that I would not be living up to my policy\r\nof the past if I should sign this bill.\"\r\n\r\n\"But even if I had never had the opportunity to record my opposition on\r\nthese different occasions, I should have vetoed the bill anyway, because\r\nit is a vicious bill. The bill is not a change of venue bill in the\r\nstrict sense of the word. It simply gives the man on trial the right to\r\ndisqualify the Judge on the ground of bias on the slightest pretext.\"\r\n\r\n\"The worst feature about the bill is that it grants this right to the\r\naccused after the jury has been secured. Why, if the defendant didn't\r\nlike the adverse rulings of the Judge he could easily claim bias and the\r\nlaw would upheld his demand for another Judge. Think of how that would\r\noperate in the Calhoun trial in San Francisco. Such a law would cost the\r\nState thousands of dollars. It's vicious and I will not sign it.\"\r\n\r\n[2] Most suggestively shown in the amendment of the Direct Primary bill.\r\n\r\n[3] The seriousness of the mistake made by the reform element in\r\nacquiescing in Wolfe's election, was emphasized at the time of the\r\ndeadlock in the Senate over the Direct Primary bill. The President of\r\nthe Senate, Lieutenant-Governor Porter - and in his absence the\r\nPresident pro tem., Wolfe, - was charged with the duty of calling the\r\nSenate to order. Inasmuch as it did not suit the machine's interests\r\nthat the Senate should be called to order, the Senators were obliged to\r\nsit in idleness for hours at a time, while the machine leaders and\r\nlobbyists were working openly on the floor of the Senate to force\r\ncertain of the pro-primary Senators to join the machine forces. Had\r\nthe President pro tem. been one of the group of Senators who were\r\nopposing the machine he would have called the Senate to order, thus\r\npermitting the regular work of the session to proceed. See Chapter 10,\r\n\"Fight on Assembly Amendments.\"\r\n\r\n[4] The action of the Assembly Committee on Public Morals on the\r\nAnti-Racetrack Gambling bill was a notable exception to this. See\r\nchapters 6 and 7.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOrganization of the Senate.\r\n\r\nAnti-Machine Republicans, Led Into a Caucus Trap, Surrendered the\r\nAppointment of President Pro Tem., Secretary and Sergeant-at-Arms to the\r\nMachine - Machine Given the Selection of the Standing Committees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the light of the events of the session, the division between the\r\nmachine or \"organization\" and anti-machine forces in the Senate for\r\npurposes of organization may be regarded as follows:\r\n\r\nAnti-machine - Anthony[5], Bell, Birdsall, Black, Boynton, Burnett[5],\r\nCutten, Estudillo, Hurd[5], Roseberry, Rush, Stetson, Strobridge,\r\nThompson, Walker (labeled Republicans), Caminetti, Campbell, Cartwright,\r\nHolohan, Miller, Sanford (labeled Democrats) - 21.\r\n\r\nMachine - Hare, Kennedy (labeled -Democrats), Bates, Bills, Finn,\r\nHartman, Leavitt, Lewis, Martinelli, McCartney, Reily, Savage, Weed,\r\nWillis, Wolfe, Wright (labeled Republicans) - 16.\r\n\r\nDoubtful - Curtin (Democrat).\r\n\r\nSeekers of the winning side - Price and Welch (labeled Republicans).\r\n\r\nCurtin is put down as doubtful because, justly or unjustly, he was at\r\nthe opening of the session so regarded. But Curtin's record shows that\r\ngenerally speaking from the beginning to the end of the session he voted\r\nwith the anti-machine element. Had the anti-machine forces made a\r\ndetermined effort to organize the Senate and demonstrated a strength of\r\ntwenty-one votes, which would have been enough to organize,. Curtin\r\nwould certainly have been with them. The same is true of Welch, and it\r\nis probably true of Price. This would have given the anti-machine forces\r\nfrom twenty-two to twenty-four votes, a safe margin to have permitted\r\nthem to organize the Senate to carry out anti-machine policies.\r\n\r\nThe machine claquers will no doubt point gleefully to the fact that when\r\nthe test on the Railroad Regulation bills came, Anthony, Burnett,\r\nEstudillo, Hurd and Walker strayed from the anti-machine fold. This\r\nobjection would have more weight had there ever been an anti-machine\r\nfold. As a matter of fact, the anti-machine element in the Senate from\r\nthe day the session opened until it closed was unorganized, and without\r\nleaders or detailed plan of action.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly Estudillo and Burnett strayed on the railroad regulation\r\nquestion, but they did so believing the absolute rate provided in the\r\nStetson bill to be unconstitutional. All this will be brought out in the\r\nchapters on railroad regulation measures, but in passing, it may be said\r\nthat Burnett, in the closing hours of the session, stated on the floor\r\nof the Senate that he had voted against the Stetson bill and for the\r\nWright bill on the understanding that a constitutional amendment would\r\nbe passed setting at rest all question of the constitutionality of the\r\nabsolute rate. The machine leaders misled Senator Burnett. Machine votes\r\ndefeated the amendment.\r\n\r\nAnthony, Estudillo and Walker stood out against the machine in the\r\ndirect primary fight which followed the defeat of the Stetson bill, and\r\nbefore the fight was over, Burnett had returned to the anti-machine\r\nforces.\r\n\r\nThe case of Senator Hurd is not at all creditable to the machine. But\r\nHurd's instincts and sympathies are not those of Gus Hartman, Hare,\r\nWolfe and Leavitt. Had the anti-machine forces had even semblance of\r\norganization there would have been no straying, and the accomplishment\r\nof the legislative session of 1909 would have been more satisfactory to\r\nthe best citizenship of the State.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the anti-machine forces, without leaders and without\r\norganization, stuck together so well as they did is one of the most\r\nextraordinary and at the same time encouraging features of the session.\r\n\r\nAlthough the anti-machine forces numbered a majority of the Senate,\r\nnevertheless a bare majority of the regular Republican Senators - those\r\nwho were eligible to admittance to the Republican caucus - were with the\r\nmachine. The division in the Republican caucus, counting Welch and Price\r\nwith the machine element, was on machine and anti-machine lines as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nAnti-machine - Anthony, Birdsall, Black, Boynton, Burnett, Cutten,\r\nEstudillo, Hurd, Roseberry, Rush, Stetson, Strobridge, Thompson, Walker\r\n- 14.\r\n\r\nMachine - Bates, Pills, Finn, Hartman, Leavitt, Lewis, Martinelli,\r\nMcCartney, Price, Reily, Savage, Weed, Welch, Willis, Wolfe, Wright -\r\n16.\r\n\r\nBy time-honored custom it has become a rule for the majority[5a] in the\r\nSenate - and the same holds in the Assembly - to meet in caucus to\r\ndecide upon the details of organization. This is done on the theory that\r\nthe House should be so organized as to permit the majority to carry out\r\nits policies as expeditiously and with as little friction as possible.\r\nBy the unwritten rule of the caucus, the majority governs and each\r\nmember who attends the caucus is bound in honor to vote - regardless of\r\nhis individual views or wishes - on the floor of the Senate or Assembly,\r\nas the majority of the caucus decides. Thus, by going into caucus with\r\nthe sixteen machine Senators, the fourteen anti-machine Senators were\r\nplaced in a position where they were, under caucus rule, compelled to\r\nvote on the floor of the Senate as the sixteen machine Senators\r\ndictated. This gave the machine on the floor of the Senate thirty votes\r\nout of forty on questions affecting organization, and permitted it to\r\nname the President pro tem., the Secretary of the Senate, the\r\nSergeant-at-Arms, and gave it filial voice in the appointment of the\r\nvarious attaches.\r\n\r\nHad the line of division in the Senate been Republican and Democratic,\r\nthe Republicans in the Senate might very properly have caucused. But\r\ninasmuch as the machine Republicans stood during the entire session for\r\none set of policies, and the anti-machine Republicans for another, the\r\ncaucus was at best an incongruous affair. Especially is this true when\r\nit is considered that the anti-machine Republicans immediately after\r\nthey had left the caucus united with the anti-machine Democrats in a\r\nthree-months contest with the united machine Democrats and machine\r\nRepublicans. But having surrendered the organization of the Senate to\r\nthe machine, the anti-machine Senators, although in the majority, fought\r\nunder a handicap, finally lost the weaker of their supporters[6], and in\r\nthe end went down in defeat. Had the real majority, rather than the\r\nartificial majority, of the Senate caucused on organization, that is to\r\nsay, had the anti-machine Republicans and the anti-machine Democrats\r\ncaucused, and organized to carry out the policies for which they stood\r\nand for which they fought together during the entire session, the\r\nRepublican-Democratic-machine element would have been defeated at every\r\nturn. But no such policy governed, and the anti-machine Republicans\r\nwaddled after precedent into the caucus trap that had been set for them.\r\nLater on in the session the anti-machine Republicans and anti-machine\r\nDemocrats did go into caucus together, and by doing so won the hardest\r\nfought fight of the session.[7]\r\n\r\nIn the Republican Senate caucus on organization, the machine Senators,\r\nunder the crafty leadership of Wolfe and Leavitt, worked their unhappy\r\nanti-machine associates much as a playful cat, with a sense of humor,\r\ntoys with a mouse. As the cat lets the mouse think that it has escaped,\r\nthe machine let the anti-machine forces think they were organizing the\r\ncaucus. Leavitt had been leader of the Republican caucus at previous\r\nsessions but he suffered \"overwhelming defeat\" at the hands of a\r\n\"reformer.\" The \"reformer\" in question was Senator Wright, who had been\r\nwell advertised as the father of the reform Direct Primary law. Before\r\nthe session closed, the anti-machine element was to learn just the sort\r\nof \"reformer\" Wright is. Wright, however, in the interest of \"harmony,\"\r\nwas nominated for caucus leadership by Senator Wolfe. Leavitt's name was\r\nnot even mentioned. The unanimous vote went to Senator Wright, who was\r\nduly declared elected Chairman of the Senate Republican caucus for the\r\nThirty-eighth Session of the California Legislature.\r\n\r\nThe reformers were also permitted to name the Secretary of the caucus.\r\nThis time a genuine anti-machine Senator was selected, A. E. Boynton.\r\n\r\nAnd then came a question which brought out the gleam of the machine's\r\nteeth. Senator Boynton moved that Senator Bell, of Pasadena, be admitted\r\nto the caucus. Somewhat to the discomfiture of the reformers, Bell was\r\nnot admitted.\r\n\r\nSenator Bell's case is a suggestive one. He is a Republican, having been\r\nelected from one of the strongest Republican districts of the State, the\r\nThirty-sixth Senatorial District, which takes in Pasadena. But Senator\r\nBell was not named by the machine; in fact, he was elected as protest\r\nagainst machine methods. The Pasadena Republicans tolerated machine\r\ndomination as long as they could. Then, in 1906, they induced Bell to\r\nrun against the \"regular\" machine nominee for the State Senate. Bell ran\r\nas an independent Republican. He overwhelmingly defeated his machine\r\nopponent. Arrived at Sacramento at the session of 1907, he applied for\r\nadmittance to the Republican caucus.\r\n\r\nThere was ample precedent for his admittance, but curiously enough no\r\nanti-machine Republican who had defeated a machine Republican had ever\r\nbeen admitted to caucus privileges. In 1902, however, Charles M.\r\nShortridge, having failed to receive the nomination for the state Senate\r\nfrom Santa Clara County, ran as an independent candidate against the\r\nregular Republican nominee. The machine supported Shortridge's\r\ncandidacy, and by most questionable methods succeeded in defeating the\r\nregular Republican. But Shortridge was admitted to the Senate caucus of\r\n1903 without question. Senator Bell, however, was denied admittance to\r\nthe Republican Senate caucus of 1907, on the grounds that he had\r\ndefeated a regularly nominated Republican. Shortridge had defeated a\r\nregularly nominated Republican. But Shortridge stood for machine\r\npolicies; Bell stands opposed to machine policies. The machine's policy\r\nis to keep the caucuses of the dominant party in the Legislature as much\r\na close corporation as possible. So in 1907, Bell's application was\r\nrejected. Bell, throughout the session, opposed machine policies. Both\r\nfor the session of 1907 and of 1909, Senator Bell's record is absolutely\r\nclean. The machine does not approve such men, nor want them to\r\nparticipate in party caucuses.\r\n\r\nSenator Bell, who had, although refused admittance to his party caucus,\r\ndone very well in 1907, did not propose to apply for admission to the\r\ncaucus of 1909. But the reform element in the Senate insisted upon\r\npresenting his name. From machine sources it was intimated to Senator\r\nBell that if he would make his peace with Walter Parker, the Southern\r\nPacific lobbyist who acts as machine leader south of the Tehachepi, no\r\nopposition would be offered his admission to the caucus. Bell rejected\r\nthe offer with characteristic promptness. So the anti-machine Senators,\r\nsince they had \"organized the caucus,\" proceeded to admit Bell in the\r\nface of machine opposition.\r\n\r\nBut the inexperienced political mouse discovered that it was not out of\r\nthe reach of the claws of the experienced political cat. Boynton's\r\nmotion to admit Bell to the caucus was lost by a vote of 16 to 14.\r\n\r\nHad the reform element been organized, however, Bell would have been\r\nadmitted to the caucus. Three Senators, Reily, Savage and Welch, who\r\nordinarily voted with the machine, because of personal friendship voted\r\nto admit Bell to the caucus. But their votes were offset by those of\r\nBurnett, Estudillo and Hurd.[8] The vote was as follows:\r\n\r\nTo admit Bell to the caucus - Anthony, Birdsall, Black, Boynton, Cutten,\r\nReily, Roseberry, Rush, Savage, Stetson, Strobridge, Thompson, Walker,\r\nWelch - 14.\r\n\r\nAgainst admitting Bell to the caucus - Bates, Bills, Burnett, Estudillo,\r\nFinn, Hartman, Hurd, Leavitt, Lewis, Martinelli, McCartney, Price, Weed,\r\nWillis, Wolfe, Wright - 16.\r\n\r\nThe Bell matter out of the way, the real work of organizing the Senate\r\nwas taken up. Curiously enough, the only contest came over the election\r\nof the Chaplain of the Senate; the naming of the President pro tem., of\r\nthe Secretary of the Senate and of the Sergeant-at-Arms was not opposed.\r\nSenator Price moved that Lewis A. Hilborn be the caucus nominee for\r\nSecretary of the Senate, and J. Louis Martin for Sergeant-at-Arms. His\r\nmotion carried unanimously. Price also nominated Senator Wolfe for\r\nPresident pro tem. Not an anti-machine Senator protested. Wolfe was\r\naccordingly declared the caucus nominee, with the thirty Senators\r\npresent, machine and anti-machine, obligated to vote for him on the\r\nfloor of the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe election of a Chaplain was then taken up and several candidates\r\nnominated for the office. Rev. Father H. H. Wyman being finally\r\nselected, which, of course, was equivalent to election.\r\n\r\nThe caucus was held at 9 o'clock of the morning of January 4. At noon of\r\nthe same day a second caucus was held at which it was decided that the\r\ndivision of patronage[8a] should be on the following basis: That $18 a\r\nday should be set aside for the Secretary, Sergeant-at-Arms and\r\nChaplain; that the Lieutenant-Governor should be allowed $22 a day, and\r\neach of the thirty caucus Senators $15 a day. This practically concluded\r\nRepublican caucusing for the session. At previous sessions the\r\nRepublicans caucused practically every day. But before the session of\r\n1909 had advanced far, the real line that divided the Senators, the line\r\nthat separated the machine from the anti-machine members, had become so\r\npronounced that caucuses of machine and anti-machine Republicans became\r\nimpracticable. Senator Wright, toward the end of the session, made\r\nfrantic efforts to get the caucus together; but he failed. The caucus on\r\norganization was about all that the anti-machine Republicans could\r\nstand.\r\n\r\nAs they had left the election of the officers of the Senate to the\r\nmachine, the anti-machine element left the appointing of the Senate\r\ncommittees to the machine Lieutenant-Governor.[9]\r\n\r\nHow well the machine, given the appointment of the committees, fortified\r\nitself is shown by consideration of practically any one of the\r\ncommittees. A few examples will suffice.\r\n\r\nThere were, for example, three great issues before the Legislature;\r\nnamely, the Anti-Racetrack Gambling bill, a moral issue; the Direct\r\nPrimary bill, a political issue; and the Railroad Regulation bills, a\r\ncommercial issue.\r\n\r\nThe Anti-Gambling bill was to come before the Public Morals Committee,\r\nand the machine took good care that not an anti-machine Senator should\r\nbe given a place on that committee. The committee consisted of Weed,\r\nWolfe, Leavitt, Savage (labeled Republicans), Kennedy (labeled\r\nDemocrat), all machine men. The committee reported back the\r\nAnti-Gambling bill under pressure, with the recommendation that it \"do\r\nnot pass.\" Public opinion was such at the time that Savage and Kennedy\r\ndid not vote for the unfavorable recommendation. But Weed, Wolfe and\r\nLeavitt, a majority of the committee, stood out against the bill until\r\nthe last.\r\n\r\nThe Direct Primary bill was to be considered by the Election Laws\r\nCommittee and the machine took good care to keep hand upon that\r\ncommittee. The committee was made up of seven machine and two\r\nanti-machine Senators, as follows:\r\n\r\nMachine Senators - Leavitt, Hartman, Wolfe, Savage, Wright (labeled\r\nRepublicans), Kennedy and Hare (labeled Democrats).\r\n\r\nEvery one of the seven opposed the State-wide plan for the selection of\r\nUnited States Senators.\r\n\r\nThe anti-machine Senators on the committee were Estudillo and Stetson.\r\n\r\nIt is an open secret that the machine expected to control Estudillo\r\nthrough Walter Parker, the Southern Pacific political agent. Its failure\r\nbrought some confusion upon machine circles. Thus, the machine really\r\nthought when it picked the Committee on Election Laws that it controlled\r\neight of the nine members.\r\n\r\nThe Railroad Regulation measures were to be passed upon by the Committee\r\non Corporations. The machine took care to be in control of that\r\ncommittee. It consisted of eleven members. Seven of the eleven, if\r\nBurnett who voted with the machine on this issue be counted with them,\r\nwere machine, one was \"band wagon[10], which is a trifle worse than\r\nmachine, and three anti-machine, as follows:\r\n\r\nMachine - Bates, Wright, McCartney, Burnett, Bills, Finn (labeled\r\nRepublicans), Kennedy (labeled Democrat).\r\n\r\nBand wagon - Welch.\r\n\r\nAnti-machine - Walker, Roseberry (labeled Republicans), and Miller\r\n(labeled Democrat).\r\n\r\nBut here again the machine was more generous than it intended to be. It\r\nfigured on controlling Walker. But in the committee Walker stood out\r\nmanfully for the Stetson bill and against the Wright bill. On the floor\r\nof the Senate, however, Walker made his one slip of the session, by\r\nvoting for the Wright bill and against the Stetson bill.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to continue consideration of the committees. Enough\r\nhas been said to show how thoroughly the machine minority, given the\r\nappointment of the committees, strengthened itself in the Senate by\r\nseizing every strategic position. Indeed, the machine fortified itself\r\nwith such far-seeing intelligence, that one marvels that the\r\nanti-machine majority was able to offer even temporarily effective\r\nopposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[5] Anthony's vote was in the majority of cases cast on the side of the\r\nmachine. But the determined stand that he took on the Direct Primary\r\nbill issue, demonstrated that Anthony, had the anti-machine forces\r\nmaintained any sort of organization, or had they had definite plan of\r\naction, would have been found consistently on the side of good\r\ngovernment. Burnett was unquestionably misled by the machine leaders.\r\nNeither Burnett nor Anthony can be justly classed with Hartman, Wolfe,\r\nLeavitt, Bills, etc., etc. Hurd, who toward the end of the session voted\r\nconstantly with the machine, and is considered hopeless by many\r\nobservers, nevertheless took active part in the anti-machine caucus on\r\nthe Direct Primary bill, and, had the organization of the Senate been in\r\nthe hands of the anti-machine element, the writer firmly believes, would\r\nhave continued with the reform forces. At any rate, he was available for\r\nany anti-machine movement that might have been started to organize the\r\nSenate. Hurd, like Burnett, will have his opportunity in 1911. Both\r\nSenators hold over.\r\n\r\n[5a] In this instance, the Republican Senators. The Senate minority was\r\nmade up of the Democratic Senators, if we make the division on party\r\nlines. But as a matter of fact, when it came to the real business of the\r\nsession, the Senate did not divide on party lines. The actual division\r\nwas between the machine and the anti-machine Senators. Thus the real\r\nmajority consisted of anti-machine Senators, and the minority of the\r\nSenators controlled by the machine.\r\n\r\n[6] Hurd's case illustrates this very well.\r\n\r\n[7] See chapter nine - Machine defeated in the Senate.\r\n\r\n[8] Burnett of San Francisco, voted against Bell on partisan grounds,\r\nand inability to grasp the situation. Estudillo's vote was inconsistent\r\nwith the majority which he cast during the session, while Hurd's was\r\ninconsistent with those which he cast up to the time of his vote with\r\nthe machine forces against the Stetson bill.\r\n\r\n[8a] Up to the session of 1909, the members of the Legislature fixed the\r\namount of patronage. At the session of 1907, the payroll of the officers\r\nand attaches of the Assembly alone ran up to nearly $10,000 a week, or\r\nmore than $1300 a day. But in 1908, the People adopted a constitutional\r\namendment limiting the amount of patronage, the money to be expended for\r\nlegislative officers and attaches, to $500 a day for each House. This\r\ncut the Patronage down something more than one-half, which gave the\r\nSenators and Assemblymen who divided it great concern.\r\n\r\nThe development of the patronage scandal during the last decade is\r\ninteresting. At the session of 1901 the Assembly patronage ran about\r\n$580 a day the Senate patronage about $610. This was only $80 a day more\r\nin the Assembly, and $110 more in the Senate than the limit now fixed by\r\nthe Constitution.\r\n\r\nIn 1903, the patronage in the Assembly totaled $6312.50 a week, more\r\nthan $900 a day. In the Senate it was $5612.50, or $800 a day.\r\n\r\nThe increase continued in 1905. in that year Assembly Patronage totaled\r\n$7956.50 a week, or $1135 a day, while the Senate patronage was $6002.50\r\na week, or $857 a day.\r\n\r\nThe climax came in 1907, when the Assembly patronage went to $9660.50 a\r\nweek, or $1350 a day, and the Senate patronage to to $6893.50 a week, or\r\n$985 a day. What it would have been in 1909 had there been no\r\nConstitutional restriction placed upon it, is a matter for speculation.\r\n\r\n[9] See concluding chapter as to how this could have been avoided.\r\n\r\n[10] The term \"band wagon\" was applied during the session to those\r\nmembers who were in the habit of joining the winning side at the last\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOrganization of the Assembly.\r\n\r\nIndependent Movement to Resist the Machine's Program Failed - Reform\r\nElement Rallied and Rejected Rules Prepared by Committee Appointed by\r\nStanton, Which Would Have Placed Majority at Mercy of the\r\nMachine-Controlled Minority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe machine-free members of the Lower House at least did better than the\r\nreformers in the Senate; they made an attempt to organize the Assembly\r\nindependent of the machine. The effort was, however, as uncertain as\r\nthat of a nestling taking its first lesson in flying. Nothing came of\r\nthe venture; but it indicates what may be done in future.\r\n\r\nThe organization of the Assembly hinges on the election of the Speaker.\r\nThe machine ordinarily picks the Speaker before the November elections,\r\nso his election need not stir up any particular enthusiasm. But there is\r\nalways something of a contest started - for the sake of appearances,\r\nprobably.\r\n\r\nThis year the machine had picked Phil Stanton, of Los Angeles, for the\r\njob, but Bob Beardslee, of Stockton, was permitted to give Stanton \"a\r\nrun.\"\r\n\r\nThe San Francisco newspapers along in November and December recorded the\r\npolitical ripple of the contest, but the fight was a dead affair, and\r\nnobody enthused. The play came to a tame ending when Beardslee nominated\r\nStanton for the Speaker's job and got the Chairmanship of the important\r\nCommittee on Ways and Means for being good, or taking program, however\r\none may view it.\r\n\r\nBut at one time a real fight for the Speakership threatened. Assemblyman\r\nDrew, of Fresno, and other stanch anti-machine men, conceived the\r\nradical notion that it was idiotic for them to sit around like lambs\r\nwaiting to have their throats cut, while the machine organized the\r\nHouse. They accordingly decided to take a hand in the organization of\r\nthe Assembly themselves by refusing to vote for any man for Speaker who\r\nwas known to be under the influence of the machine.\r\n\r\nForty-one votes are required to elect the Speaker. The reformers figured\r\non the nineteen Democratic members as with them. The Lincoln-Roosevelt\r\nLeague had elected Assemblymen from several counties, including Alameda.\r\nThese were naturally counted on. Other reputable Republican members were\r\nexpected to join the movement in numbers sufficient to secure the\r\nnecessary forty-one votes.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the leaders of this departure from the regular rules of\r\nthe political game should have commended itself to every good citizen.\r\nTheir idea was to organize the Assembly, not for self-advancement, or\r\nthe promotion of special privileges as the machine leaders do year after\r\nyear, but that good bills might be passed and bad bills defeated; that\r\nthe waste of the public funds might be stopped; that worthy citizenship\r\nmight be placed above predatory partisanship. And yet, they were\r\ncompelled to proceed with the utmost caution; were discouraged at every\r\nturn, and abused like pickpockets, even by those upon whom they depended\r\nfor support. Gradually it dawned upon them that not a few of the\r\nDemocratic members were not in sympathy with reform legislation. But\r\nmore discouraging still was the fact that certain Republicans elected to\r\nthe Assembly by the Lincoln-Roosevelt faction of the party were as\r\nlittle to be depended upon. By consulting the tables \"B\" and \"C\" of\r\nAssembly votes in the appendix, it will be seen that Democrats like\r\nBaxter, Collum, Hopkins, O'Neil and Wheelan, and Lincoln-Roosevelt\r\nRepublicans like Mott, Pulcifer and Feeley, as a general thing voted\r\nwith the machine Republicans. There were, to be sure, Democrats like\r\nGillis, Johnson of Placer, Juilliard, Maher, Mendenhall, Polsley,\r\nPreston, Wilson, Odom and Stuckenbruck, who were against the machine on\r\nevery issue, but the record shows the utter foolishness of regarding\r\neither party free of machine influences. Without being able to\r\nunderstand just how it was, Mr. Drew and his associates failed to secure\r\nthe encouragement for their independent movement which they expected.\r\nThe stealthy move upon the Speaker's chair was found in some\r\nunaccountable way to be blocked. Then some cautious soul suggested that\r\nif they should fail the machine would hold up the appropriation bills of\r\nthose identified with the movement. That settled it. The attempt to\r\nelect as Speaker some member free of machine influence ended right\r\nthere. The reformers skurried for cover.\r\n\r\nThe part which the appropriation bills play in the enactment of bad laws\r\nis one of the least understood of a legislative session. Each session\r\nmoney must be appropriated by legislative enactment for the maintenance\r\nand enlargement, where necessary, of the various State institutions,\r\nsuch as hospitals for the insane, reform schools, normal schools, and\r\nthe like. These institutions are not local at all, but State. But the\r\nSenators and Assemblymen from the counties in which they are situated\r\nare, by custom, charged with the responsibility of securing the\r\nappropriations necessary for their support. The San Jose Normal School,\r\nfor example, and the Agnew Asylum for the Insane, are situated in Santa\r\nClara County. They are no more Santa Clara County institutions than they\r\nare Del Norte or San Diego institutions, but the Senators and\r\nAssemblymen from Santa Clara County are held responsible for the passage\r\nof the appropriation bills affecting them. Too often, the ability of the\r\nAssemblyman or Senator is measured, not by his real work in the\r\nLegislature, but by the size of the appropriations which he manages to\r\nsecure for his district. Under the present system by which the machine\r\norganizes the Legislature, it is in a position to defeat or materially\r\nreduce practically any appropriation bill. The member of the Legislature\r\nwho would oppose the machine thus finds himself between the constituents\r\nat home, who demand that he secure generous appropriations for his\r\ndistrict, and the machine, which he understands very well requires\r\nsupport of its policies as one of the prices of the constituent-demanded\r\nappropriations. Thus those who would have opposed the machine in the\r\norganization of the Assembly realized that failure would probably mean a\r\nhammering of their appropriation bills, which would result in their\r\npolitical undoing at home. So the independent movement to organize the\r\nAssembly came to a sorry ending.\r\n\r\nStanton was elected Speaker without opposition. The \"defeated\" Beardslee\r\nplaced him in nomination. Complete harmony prevailed. Stanton started\r\nproceedings by appointing the Committee on Rules. This committee was\r\ncharged with drafting rules for the government of the Assembly during\r\nthe session. It was made up of Assemblymen Johnston of Contra Costa,\r\nTransue, Johnson of Sacramento, Beardslee and Stanton.\r\n\r\nWithout the people knowing much about what is going on, the rules\r\ngoverning legislative bodies are being amended from time to time, so\r\nthat the power of influencing legislation is being taken out of the\r\nhands of the duly elected representatives of the people and placed with\r\npresiding officers and important committees. The \"system,\" or the\r\nmachine, call it what you may, finds it easier to control presiding\r\nofficers and committees appointed by presiding officers, than to control\r\nLegislatures. This stealthy advance upon the liberties of the people,\r\nseems to have reached its climax at Washington, where the independent\r\nmembers of both parties are in open revolt against \"Cannonism.\" But\r\n\"Cannonism\" is not confined to the National Congress alone; in a small\r\nway it has its hold on the California Legislature. The rules prepared by\r\nSpeaker Stanton's committee were well calculated to give \"Cannonism\" a\r\nstronger hold in California, which would have influenced not only the\r\nsession of 1909 but, as a precedent, many sessions to come.[11] The\r\nproposed rules in saddling \"Cannonism\" upon the Assembly were well\r\ncalculated to strengthen the machine's grip upon the Legislature.\r\n\r\nThe departure from the rules of 1907 was most radical. Under the rules\r\nthat governed the Assembly in 1907, committees were required to report\r\non each bill referred to them within ten days after the measure had been\r\nsubmitted.\r\n\r\nThe rules proposed by the committee provided that the report should be\r\nmade as soon as \"practicable.\"\r\n\r\nThe rules of 1907 provided that a mere majority could recall a bill from\r\ncommittee.\r\n\r\nUnder the proposed rules a two-thirds vote would have been necessary.\r\n\r\nUnder the rules of 1907 a measure could be advanced on the files at the\r\nrequest of its author.\r\n\r\nUnder the committee's rules unanimous consent of the Assembly was made\r\nnecessary for such advancement.\r\n\r\nThe proposed rules would have enabled the machine forces to smother in\r\ncommittee any measure the machine wished to defeat. A two-thirds vote\r\nwould have been necessary to suspend the rules to have a bill recalled\r\nfrom committee, that is to say, the votes of fifty-four Assemblymen.\r\nTwenty-seven Assemblymen could then have held the measure in committee\r\nuntil the session closed.\r\n\r\nHad the committee-prepared rules been adopted, the probabilities are\r\nthat the battleground of the session would have been transferred from\r\nthe Senate Chamber to the Assembly.\r\n\r\nBut the proposed rules were not adopted. A fight against adopting the\r\ncommittee's report was started by Drew of Fresno. Mr. Drew introduced a\r\nresolution rejecting the rules submitted by the committee, and\r\nsubstituting the rules of 1907, to govern the session of 1909. Johnson\r\nof Sacramento led the defense that rallied to the committee's report.\r\nBut Johnson's wit failed against the argument which Drew, Callan,\r\nPreston, Young and Cattell offered. The gentlemen denounced the rules\r\nwhich the committee had offered as \"vicious, despotic and gagging.\"\r\nDrew's resolution was adopted by a vote of 41 to 32, the committee's\r\nreport rejected and the rules of 1907 accepted for the session of\r\n1909[12]. It was a decided victory for the anti-machine forces, and\r\nbrought gloom to the scheming machine leaders. But it developed later\r\nthat not a few who had voted for the Drew resolution were safely\r\nmachine; while many who had voted against it were anti-machine, but had\r\nvoted against the resolution under misapprehension of just what it stood\r\nfor[13].\r\n\r\nAlthough the reform majority in the Assembly could prevent the adoption\r\nof the \"gag rules,\" it could not, after it had failed to elect the\r\nSpeaker, govern the appointment of the committees. By and large, the\r\nAssembly committees were controlled as were the Senate committees by\r\nmachine standbys. The Election Laws Committee, which was to pass upon\r\nthe Direct Primary bill, was safely in machine hands. Grove L. Johnson,\r\nas Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, herded the young lawyers thereon\r\nlike so many sheep. Johnson was in effect the committee.\r\n\r\nThe Committee on Corporations and the Committee on Common Carriers,\r\nbefore which railroad regulation bills might come, were safely in\r\nmajority for the machine.\r\n\r\nOne apparent exception to the rule was the Committee on Public Morals,\r\nwhich gave the Anti-Gambling bill its start toward passage. But this\r\ncommittee, which did so much to secure the passage of the Anti-Gambling\r\nbill, held up the Local Option bill at Speaker Stanton's request, until\r\nthe last week of the session, thus making its passage in the Assembly\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nA curious mistake was made by the machine, when Telfer of San Jose was\r\nmade Chairman of the Committee on Contingent Expenses. Telfer is not\r\nonly anti-machine, but possessed of a non-political honesty which proved\r\nvery distressing to the machine before the session was over.\r\n\r\nTelfer as Chairman of the committee refused to \"O. K.\" extravagant\r\ncharges for the materials furnished the Assembly. As a result, bills for\r\nhire of typewriters had to be reduced, pencils counted and other\r\nastonishing reductions made.\r\n\r\nTelfer saved the State several hundred dollars, but caused many a\r\nheartache. Telfer's appointment to a committee which he made important,\r\nshows that the machine element as well as the anti-machine sometimes\r\nmakes mistakes. But in spite of its minor mistakes, in spite of the\r\nanti-machine majority, so admirably did the machine organize the\r\nAssembly for its purposes, that in the closing days of the session not\r\nonly were vicious measures passed without much difficulty, but the\r\nAssembly was made the graveyard of good bills[14].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[11] If ever the People of California secure control of the State\r\nLegislature through machine-free representatives with the courage to\r\ndare and the ability to do, one of the most important pieces of work\r\nwill be to sweep aside the mass of precedent which the machine has for\r\nyears been gradually embodying into the rules of Senate and Assembly.\r\nWhat is needed is a set of rules that shall promote the expression of\r\nthe wishes of the majority. The curse of technicality does not hamper\r\nthe Judiciary alone; it hampers the legislative branch of government as\r\nwell. Note Wolfe's ability to deadlock the Senate after the Assembly\r\nAmendments to the Direct Primary bill had been rejected. Chapter XI.\r\n\r\n[12] The vote by which this was done was as follows:\r\n\r\nFor the Drew resolution and against the committee rules: Assemblymen\r\nBlack, Bohnett, Callan, Cattell, Cogswell, Collum, Costar, Cronin, Drew,\r\nFlint, Gibbons, Hammon, Hanlon, Hayes, Hewitt, Hinkle, Hopkins, Irwin,\r\nJohnson of Placer, Juilliard, Lightner, Maher, Melrose, Mendenhall,\r\nOdom, Otis, O'Neil, Polsley, Preston, Rech, Rutherford, Sackett, Silver,\r\nStuckenbruck, Telfer, Wagner, Webber, Wheelan, Whitney, Wilson and\r\nYoung. - 41.\r\n\r\nAgainst the Drew resolution and for the committee rules: Assemblymen\r\nBarndollar, Beardslee, Beban, Coghlan, Collier, Cullen, Dean, Feeley,\r\nFlavelle, Fleisher, Gerdes, Greer, Griffiths, Hans, Hawk, Holmquist,\r\nJohnson of Sacramento, Johnson of San Diego, Johnston, Leeds, Macauley,\r\nMcClelland, McManus, Moore, Mott, Nelson, Perine, Pugh, Pulcifer,\r\nSchmitt, Stanton, Transue - 32.\r\n\r\n[13] A gentleman who for a number of years has been identified with the\r\nreform element in the Assembly, writes of this feature of the machine's\r\nhold on the Legislature as follows: \"One of the principal difficulties\r\nwith the Legislature as it is now constituted and has been for many\r\nyears past, is that the machine or organization always endeavors to\r\nsecure the election of young men who haven't very fixed opinions and who\r\nare easily influenced; not knowing the machine tactics and the real\r\nobject behind the legislation they do not seem to see the necessity for\r\nstanding firm and for that reason are often led into voting for or\r\nagainst measures which they would not were they more familiar with the\r\ntricks of the machine men. A new grist of legislators is what the\r\norganization is always looking for. They want a certain number of old\r\n\"stand-bys\" who will do their dirty work for a mere pittance or some\r\npaltry reward, real or anticipated, and with these men to influence and\r\ncontrol the younger members their purpose is easily, accomplished.\"\r\n\r\n[14] See Passage of Wheelan Bills, chapter XVII; Passage of Change of\r\nVenue bill, chapter XVI. Examples of good bills defeated in the Assembly\r\nin the closing days of the session were the Judicial Column bill, and\r\nthe Holohan measure removing the party circle from the election ballot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Machine in Control.\r\n\r\nDeliberately Held Up Measures in Committees Until the Close of the\r\nSession, When Senate and Assembly Were Forced to Take Snap Judgment on\r\nHundreds of Measures - In the Confusion Thus Created, Good Bills Were\r\nDefeated and Bad Ones Passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Legislature organized, the machine and anti-machine forces settled\r\ndown to the work of the session. The situation was unique. The\r\nanti-machine element had a comfortable majority in the Assembly and at\r\nleast a bare majority in the Senate. But the machine controlled the\r\ncommittees of both Houses, had selected the presiding officers, and had\r\ndictated the selection of the majority of the attaches. When, for\r\nexample, it was suggested that in the event of a close vote in the\r\nSenate on the Anti-Racetrack Gambling bill, it might be found necessary\r\nto send the Sergeant-at-Arms after Senators who might attempt to dodge\r\nthe vote, not a single attache of the Sergeant-at-Arms' office could be\r\nnamed who was in sympathy with the movement against the gamblers.\r\nIncidentally, however, it was discovered that the clerk of the important\r\nSenate Enrolling and Engrossing Committee had been an employee at Frank\r\nDaroux's notorious Sausalito poolrooms. These were disquieting\r\ndiscoveries for the reform element.\r\n\r\nAlthough the machine controlled the strategic positions of the\r\norganization of the Legislature, it was still in the minority in each\r\nHouse. This meant that the machine could not, in open fight, pass a\r\nvicious or undesirable measure, or put through any of its schemes. The\r\nmachine's course soon became apparent. If the machine could not put laws\r\non the statute books to its liking, it could block the passage of good\r\nmeasures. Having crafty leaders in both Senate and Assembly, and, above\r\nall, controlling the committees, the machine was admirably prepared to\r\ndo this. By employing delaying tactics which would have done credit to a\r\nspecialist in criminal defense, the machine devoted the first two months\r\nof the session to the blocking of legislation.\r\n\r\nThe methods employed were very simple. As soon as a bill was introduced\r\nit was referred to a committee of the House in which it originated. The\r\ncommittee would hold the measure until the reform element gave\r\nindications of protesting[15]. The bill would then be returned. If\r\npossible it would be further delayed by amendment on second or third\r\nreading. If finally passed by the House of its origin, it would be sent\r\nto the other House, where it would be referred to a committee. In the\r\nmajority of cases the committee could hold it indefinitely. In such\r\ncases as the committees were forced to report on measures that had\r\npassed the other House, the measure would be amended, which necessitated\r\nits being reprinted, and again acted upon by the House of its\r\norigin[16], all of which made for delay.\r\n\r\nBut it must not be thought that the Senate and Assembly were left in\r\nidleness during the first two months of the session. Such is by no means\r\nthe case; Senators and Assemblymen never worked harder. The machine\r\nleaders during the first month of the session craftily kept the members\r\nwrangling in committees. During the second month the Senate was kept\r\nworking day and night passing comparatively unimportant Senate bills,\r\nand the Assembly working as hard passing Assembly bills; but the Senate\r\npassed very few Assembly bills and the Assembly very few Senate bills.\r\nAs a measure must pass both Houses to become a law, few bills were sent\r\nto the Governor for his approval. Thus during the first two months of\r\nthe session many bills passed in one house or the other, but pitifully\r\nfew passed the Legislature.\r\n\r\nThe reform element, working sixteen hours a day not unlike so many mice\r\nin a wheel, were apparently in complete ignorance of the situation which\r\nthey were creating. Senators whose bills had passed the Senate began to\r\ncomplain that they could not get the measures out of the Assembly\r\ncommittee; Assemblymen whose measures had passed the Assembly were as\r\nloud in their charges that their bills were being held up in Senate\r\ncommittees. The machine actually turned this early dissatisfaction to\r\nits advantage. Soon it was being announced on the floor of the Assembly:\r\n\"If Senate committees will not act on Assembly bills, then the Assembly\r\ncommittees will not act on Senate bills.\" The Senate made the same\r\nthreats as to Assembly bills. So, for about a week, Senate committees\r\nopenly slighted Assembly bills, while Assembly committees in retaliation\r\nslighted Senate bills. The situation was very amusing; it was, too,\r\nhighly satisfactory to the machine.\r\n\r\nAbout the first week in March - the Legislature adjourned March 24 - the\r\nanti-machine members awoke to the fact that in spite of their day and\r\nnight sessions, little had been accomplished. The further disquieting\r\ndiscovery was made that the bulk of the Assembly bills which had passed\r\nthe Assembly were being held in Senate committees, while the Senate\r\nbills which had passed the Senate, were apparently anchored in Assembly\r\ncommittees, and that the machine controlled the committees. The reform\r\nmembers of each House had good cause for alarm. Every Senator and\r\nAssemblyman has his \"pet\" measures. The reform Senators and Assemblymen\r\nfound that to get their bills out of committees they would have to treat\r\nwith the machine. Such a Senator or Assemblyman, with his constituents\r\nclamoring for the passage of a bill held up in a machine-controlled\r\ncommittee, had some claim to pardon if he turned suddenly attentive to\r\nthe machine olive branch. And the machine, by the way, always has the\r\nolive branch out. Stand in with us, is their constant advance, and we\r\nwill see you through.\r\n\r\nAs a result of these delaying tactics, literally hundreds of bills which\r\nhad needlessly been held up in committees were forced upon the\r\nconsideration of the Senate during the last three weeks of the session.\r\nEach House made records of passing more than 100 bills a day. There was\r\nlittle pretense of reading the measures as required by the State\r\nConstitution. The clerk at the desk mumbled over their titles; they were\r\nvoted upon and became laws. In the rush to get through, as will be shown\r\nby example in other chapters, Senators and Assemblymen voted for\r\nmeasures to which they were openly opposed. The machine minority was\r\nmerely reaping the benefits of a situation which the cleverness of its\r\nleaders had created.\r\n\r\nAlthough machine-advocated and unimportant measures could be passed in\r\nsuch a situation, bills which the machine opposed could not be[17].\r\nMachine-opposed measures were either held up in committees until their\r\npassage was out of the question, or they were denied consideration in\r\nSenate or Assembly, or their advocates worn out by the tactics of the\r\nmachine leaders. Senate Bill 220, which removed the party circle from\r\nthe election ballot, passed in the Senate after a bitter contest, was\r\nheld up in the Assembly until five days before adjournment, and then\r\ndenied a second reading. Boynton's Senate Bill 249, providing for the\r\narrangement of judicial candidates on the ballot without designation of\r\nparty affiliations, intended to take the Judiciary out of politics,\r\nwhich after a long contest passed the Senate, was held up in the\r\nAssembly until the day before adjournment, when it was denied passage.\r\nThis bill was introduced in the Senate on January 12. So popular was it,\r\nsuch was the demand for its passage, that it was not openly opposed. It\r\nwas finally defeated on March 23, the day before adjournment. Thus two\r\nmonths and eleven days were required to wear out its advocates.\r\n\r\nAbout March 1, the machine began to crowd the anti-machine element for\r\nearly adjournment. At that time not far from 2000 bills were recorded in\r\nthe Senate and Assembly histories. The action had the effect of a good\r\nstiff push to a man sliding down hill; the anti-machine forces had the\r\nvotes to prevent adjournment but the machine's adjournment plans added\r\nconsiderably to anti-machine discomfiture. Senator Wolfe actually gave\r\nnotice that on Friday, March 5, he would move that the Legislature\r\nadjourn on March 13. This would have given a fortnight for consideration\r\nof nearly 2000 bills. At the time of Wolfe's motion, there were pending\r\nthe Direct Primary bill, the Railroad Regulation bills, the Commonwealth\r\nClub bills, the Islais Creek Harbor bills, and scores of other important\r\nmeasures, the passage of which had unnecessarily - albeit most cleverly\r\n- been delayed.\r\n\r\nAs a result of clever manipulation, dating from the first day of the\r\nsession, the machine was thus in the closing days, in spite of the\r\nmajority against it, able to pass, amend or defeat measures, pretty much\r\nas its leaders desired. The anti-machine forces, Republican and\r\nDemocratic, were during those last days, merely reaping the harvest\r\nwhich they had sown when they permitted the Democratic-Republican\r\nmachine to take the organization of the Legislature out of their hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[15] The Senate Committee on Election Laws, for example, held the Direct\r\nPrimary bill for thirty-eight days, and finally reported it back so\r\namended that it had to be rewritten. See chapters VI and VII on efforts\r\nof the machine to hold the Anti-Racetrack Gambling bill in committee.\r\n\r\n[16] It was stated on the floor of the Assembly, that were the Ten\r\nCommandments to be adopted by the Assembly, the Senate would find some\r\nexcuse for amending them.\r\n\r\n[17] The most astonishing example of this was furnished by the passage\r\nof the Change of Venue bill in the Senate. See chapter XVI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nElection of United States Senator.\r\n\r\nOpposition to Perkins Overcome by the Dead Weight of the Machine\r\n- Movement Against His Re-election Failed for Want of Leadership\r\n- Proceedings Without Warmth or Enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo funeral was ever attended by greater somberness than was the\r\nre-election of George C. Perkins to the United States Senate, January\r\n12-13, 1909. The nominating speeches were made without enthusiasm; not a\r\ncheer greeted Senator or Assemblyman charged with the task of putting\r\nthe aged Senator in nomination. Pulcifer of Alameda, who made the\r\nnominating speech in the Assembly, was received with icy calmness. Even\r\nwhen the Alamedan referred to the veteran Senator as \"one whose hair has\r\ngrown white and whose eyes have grown dim in the service of his\r\ncountry,\" not so much as a ripple of applause stirred the chamber. When\r\nthe speaker concluded his review of the Senator's life and political\r\ncareer, the incipient murmur of approval which somebody started died\r\naway for want of vitality.\r\n\r\nIn the Senate, the task of nominating Perkins fell to Stetson of\r\nAlameda. But Stetson's nominating speech was received with no more\r\nenthusiasm than was that of the shifty Pulcifer. The \"system,\" the\r\n\"organization,\" the \"machine,\" have it as you will, returned George C.\r\nPerkins to the United States Senate. The people of California had no\r\nvoice in it, nor, for that matter, the Legislature, although the\r\nmajority of the Legislature was opposed to the machine. In carrying out\r\nthe ignoble part prepared for them - prepared for them by the \"machine\"\r\nwhich a majority of them opposed - the members of Senate and Assembly\r\nwent through the forms prescribed without a hand clap and without a\r\ncheer.\r\n\r\nBut it must not be thought that the re-election of Senator Perkins was\r\nwithout opposition. Indeed, it met with the same sort of honest but\r\nineffective resistance that attended the election of Stanton to the\r\nSpeakership of the Lower House. And like the campaign against Stanton\r\nthe opposition to Perkins got nowhere because of the lack of leadership,\r\norganization and plan of action on the part of the resisting\r\nlegislators.\r\n\r\nThe machine had been preparing for Perkins' re-election for months; but\r\nthe opposition to Perkins made no move until after the November\r\nelections.\r\n\r\nThe first outward sign of opposition came from Assemblyman E. J. Callan\r\nof the Thirty-ninth District, the fighting reform district of San\r\nFrancisco. Callan, three or four weeks before the Legislature convened,\r\nfell into a trap which the wily Alameda County politician had set some\r\ntime previous. Perkins had long before invited criticism of his\r\n\"record,\" which meant his votes on issues that had been passed upon by\r\nthe United States Senate. As a matter of fact, such votes mean little,\r\nfor the misplaced \"courtesy of the Senate,\" under which schemers betray\r\nthe people, makes it possible for even recognized \"reformers\" to be\r\nforced to vote against most desirable measures. The other fellows of the\r\nPerkins stripe when brought to book on their \"record\" can always give in\r\ndefense: 'Why, your reformer, Senator So and So, did the same thing.' To\r\nbe sure, a La Follette does kick over the traces once in a while, in\r\nwhich event he usually votes alone, while the solemn victims of\r\n\"courtesy\" vote against him according to Senatorial custom, not to use\r\nthe more expressive word, stupidity.\r\n\r\nThus, when Perkins craftily invited his opponents to attack him on his\r\nrecord, they dodged the trap gingerly, all save Callan. Callan didn't\r\nwalk, he rushed into it, sending a scathing letter to Perkins on that\r\ngentleman's Senatorial record. Perkins' reply and explanation came as a\r\ncounter blow. The fire was tempered out of Callan's letter. Callan had\r\npermitted Perkins to select the fighting ground, and Perkins had\r\nexhibited admirable judgment.\r\n\r\nThe attack on Perkins had better been made on his attitude toward the\r\nshipping interests of California - the development of the isthmian route\r\nto New York, for example; on his attitude toward the machine, whose\r\nstrangle-hold upon the State is locked with federal patronage; on his\r\nattitude toward the so-called \"Roosevelt policies\"; on his attitude\r\ntoward the Roosevelt administration, upon which he hung with the dead\r\nweight of crafty, persistent obstruction. There were plenty of\r\nvulnerable points in the Perkins armor, but naturally in selecting the\r\npoint of attack, Perkins carefully avoided them. So Callan's bolt\r\nrebounded harmlessly, to the astonishment of the various well-meaning\r\nreformers, and the intense satisfaction of the machine, whose somewhat\r\nanxious leaders recognized full well that Callan's discomfiture would\r\ndiscourage attacks from other possibly effective sources.\r\n\r\nThe next move against Perkins came the week before the Legislature\r\nconvened. A number of anti-machine Republicans met at San Francisco to\r\ncanvass the situation, and formulate a plan to defeat Perkins if\r\npossible. It was found that on joint Senate and Assembly ballot, the\r\nDemocrats would have twenty-nine votes and the Republicans ninety-one.\r\nSixty-one votes are required for the election of a Senator. The\r\nRepublicans at the meeting considered these twenty-nine votes as with\r\nthem in the selection of an anti-machine Republican for Perkins' place.\r\nThe anti-machine Republicans thus in revolt against the machine,\r\nthemselves numbered twenty Senators and Assemblymen, which made\r\nforty-nine votes against Perkins. In addition, an even dozen Republican\r\nSenators and Assemblymen were counted upon as willing to vote against\r\nPerkins if his defeat could be shown to be certain. This would have\r\ngiven the anti-Perkins element sixty-one votes, just enough to elect.\r\nFor one of their number to fail, meant a deadlock; for two, if\r\nRepublicans, to fail meant Perkins' election. It was a slender chance,\r\nbut the possibility of success kept the movement alive until the hour of\r\nthe Senatorial caucus.\r\n\r\nThose who were promoting the movement were not at the time aware that\r\nsix of the Democratic Assemblymen and one of the Democratic Senators\r\nwere governed by such high conceptions of their duties as citizens and\r\nresponsibilities as legislators, that they were to cast their votes in\r\nthe Senatorial election for a San Francisco saloon keeper, on the ground\r\nthat he is a \"good fellow\" and had \"spent money liberally for the\r\nparty.\" This of itself made the defeat of Perkins impossible.\r\n\r\nThe anti-Perkins forces were also handicapped by the fact that they had\r\nno candidate. The machine had been craftily booming Perkins for years;\r\nthe reformers had boomed nobody[19]. They were, then, without material\r\nfor a positive fight; all they could do was negative, which is always\r\nconfession of weakness. In addition, aside from the Bulletin, there was\r\nno San Francisco publication that could be counted upon to back their\r\nmovement. The Call was openly supporting Perkins. The movement against\r\nPerkins, while it admittedly represented the attitude of the majority of\r\nthe electors of the State, and the feeling of a safe majority of both\r\nHouses of the Legislature, was without one element of real strength[20].\r\n\r\nUnder the United States Revised Statutes, the Legislature was called\r\nupon, to proceed on the second Tuesday after organization, to elect\r\nSenator Perkins' successor. As the Legislature had organized on January\r\n4, the second Tuesday fell on January 12. The call for the Republican\r\ncaucus to go through the form of selecting a candidate for the Senate,\r\nwas circulated the third and fourth days of the session. The Republican\r\nSenators all signed it, not a few of them with the non-resistance of a\r\nwretch in the hands of a hangman.\r\n\r\nMore opposition developed in the Assembly. Callan and three or four\r\nothers kept up their resistance to the last, but when the caucus\r\nassembled on Friday evening, January 8, all the Republican Senators and\r\nAssemblymen who could do so were in attendance[21].\r\n\r\nThe caucus was of course hopelessly programmed for Perkins.\r\nNevertheless, the better element of the party endeavored to secure some\r\nexpression from Senator Perkins as to his attitude toward the Western\r\ntransportation problem. This led to a heated debate which kept the\r\ncaucus in session until a late hour. The debate turned on the celebrated\r\nBristow letter.\r\n\r\nFor years, the Southern Pacific Railroad Company has been able to\r\nprevent effective water competition by way of the Isthmus of Panama. The\r\nGovernment has a line of steamers running from New York to the Isthmus,\r\nand a railroad line across the Isthmus. With an additional line of\r\nsteamers running from San Francisco to Panama, the Government would have\r\na through line from San Francisco to New York. This would give genuine\r\ncompetition with the Southern Pacific system, and free the State from\r\nthe grasp of the transportation monopoly.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1907, Hon. J. L. Bristow, now United States Senator from\r\nKansas, was appointed a Special Panama Railroad Commissioner, to\r\ninvestigate the necessity and feasibility of putting on the Pacific\r\nline. Mr. Bristow, in a report that fairly sizzled with criticism of\r\nSouthern Pacific and Pacific Mail Steamship Company methods, recommended\r\nthat the government line be established. When Pacific freight rates were\r\narbitrarily raised just before the Legislature convened, shippers of the\r\nState appealed, not to Senator Perkins or to Senator Flint, but to\r\nSenator Bristow from interior Kansas, asking that he concern himself\r\nwith having government steamers put on the San Francisco-Panama route.\r\nBristow replied that he would do what he could, that he was receiving\r\nmany letters from Western shippers who favored the plan, but that the\r\nchief difficulty in the way was the opposition of the California\r\ndelegation in the Senate.\r\n\r\nThis Bristow letter caused all the trouble at the Perkins caucus. The\r\nsuggestion was made that Perkins owed it to the State to explain the\r\ncharges brought against him by the Senator from Kansas. A resolution was\r\naccordingly introduced providing that a telegram be sent Senator Perkins\r\ncalling upon him to state whether the charge made by Senator Bristow\r\nwere true.\r\n\r\nImmediately the pro-Perkins people assumed the dignified position that\r\nsuch a telegram would be an insult to the venerable Senator from\r\nCalifornia. Nobody seems to have taken the trouble to state that the\r\nBristow charges were untrue, but that the requesting of the Senator to\r\nanswer them would be an insult to that dignitary was made subject of the\r\nwarmest oratory. So warm was it, that the opposition to Perkins melted\r\naway like wax - or putty, if putty melts - until but five members of the\r\ncaucus had the courage to vote to ask Perkins to declare himself on the\r\ntransportation problem. Callan of San Francisco voted for it, so did\r\nDrew of Fresno, so did Young of Berkeley and two others. But 77 members\r\nof the caucus voted against the resolution. Senator Perkins was\r\npermitted to maintain a dignified silence on the Bristow charges. After\r\nthe vote on the resolution, Assemblyman Callan left the caucus.\r\n\r\nBut even with the Republican caucus nomination, Perkins did not receive\r\nthe entire Republican vote. In the Assembly, Callan voted for Chester\r\nRowell of Fresno, and Sackett for Thomas R. Bard of Ventura. Fifty-six\r\nof the Assembly votes, however, were cast for Perkins.\r\n\r\nIn the Senate, Perkins received thirty-two votes. The thirty regular\r\nRepublicans voted for him, as did Senator Bell, the\r\nIndependent-Republican, and Senator Caminetti, Democrat. Senator\r\nCaminetti voted for Perkins because Caminetti regarded Perkins, as\r\nnearly as could be determined, the choice of the electors to whom\r\nCaminetti owed his election. Caminetti believes that the United States\r\nSenator should be selected by the people of the State. The nearest he\r\ncould get to this was to ascertain the wishes of the people of his\r\ndistrict. He was convinced that the people of his district wished to see\r\nPerkins re-elected. So, regardless of partisan considerations, Caminetti\r\nthe Democrat voted for Perkins the Republican. Caminetti's explanation\r\nof his vote is worthy of the most careful consideration[22].\r\n\r\nThe regular candidate of the minority for the Democratic complimentary\r\nvote was J. O. Davis, a gentleman of the highest character. But eight of\r\nthe Democratic members voted against him. Seven of the eight,\r\nAssemblymen Black, Collum, Hopkins, Lightner, O'Neil and Wheelan and\r\nSenator Hare voted for Harry P. Flannery, a San Francisco saloon-keeper;\r\nthe eighth, Senator Kennedy, voted for William H. Langdon. Six\r\nDemocratic Senators and thirteen Democratic Assemblymen voted for Mr.\r\nDavis. They were: Senators Campbell, Cartwright, Curtin, Holohan,\r\nMiller, and Sanford; Assemblymen Baxter, Gibbons, Gillis, Irwin, Johnson\r\nof Placer, Juilliard, Maher, Mendenhall, Odom, Polsley, Preston,\r\nStuckenbruck and Webber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[19] It is interesting to note that when a good citizen gives effective\r\nresistance to the machine, that the machine invariably starts the cry -\r\n\"He is a candidate for the United States Senate.\" The open candidacy -\r\nand liberal advertising - of a machine man for the Federal Senatorship\r\ncauses no adverse comment. For an anti-machine man to so aspire - or the\r\nsuspicion in machine breasts that he so aspires - is heralded as\r\nevidence of his complete unworthy and irresponsibility.\r\n\r\n[20] But when the machine Republicans of a State unite with Democrats to\r\nelect a machine man to the Federal Senate, no such difficulties attend\r\nthem. Note the election by a coalition of machine Republicans and\r\nmachine Democrats in Illinois of \"Billy\" Lorimer, the notorious \"blond\r\nboss\" of the stockyards, to the United States Senate.\r\n\r\n[21] Senator Bell, although a Republican, was excluded because he would\r\nnot make his peace with Walter Parker, the Southern Pacific boss of the\r\npolitical district lying south of Tehachepi. See Chapter 11,\r\nOrganization of the Senate.\r\n\r\n[22] Caminetti's explanation of his vote, as printed in the Senate\r\nJournal, is in full as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. President: During the campaign of 1906, in the Tenth Senatorial\r\nDistrict, resulting in my election as Senator, I made the question of\r\n'The election of United States Senators by direct vote of the people'\r\none of the leading issues upon which I asked the suffrage of the people.\r\nI then pledged myself in all my speeches and in the press, to endeavor\r\nto secure the passage of a law by the Legislature in case of my election\r\nhaving that object in view, and in case of failure in the effort I would\r\nnevertheless follow that principle and vote for the choice of a majority\r\nof the qualified electors of that district in the selection of a Senator\r\nduring my term of off cue.\r\n\r\n\"The last session of the Legislature failed to enact the necessary\r\nlegislation on the subject, but the people of my district have\r\nnevertheless plainly indicated to me that Hon. George C. Perkins was at\r\nthe last election, and now is, their choice for the United States\r\nSenatorship.\r\n\r\n\"Under these circumstances I feel in honor bound by my pledges to the\r\npeople of the Tenth Senatorial District, to record the choice of a\r\nmajority of the qualified electors thereof for Hon. George C. Perkins\r\nfor United States Senator, hoping in so doing that it will never again\r\nbe necessary for a member of the Legislature to vote the choice of the\r\npeople of his district in this, or any other, indirect way, but that\r\nthis Legislature will rise superior to partisanship and give to the\r\npeople hereafter an opportunity, under suitable laws, to vote directly\r\nfor candidates for that office. Should this Legislature fail in this\r\nhigh duty to the public, I trust that the people, in whom all power\r\nresides, will hereafter take up this matter in the way the people of the\r\nTenth Senatorial District did two years ago, and thus be able in all\r\nlegislative districts of the State to record their choice for the\r\nexalted office of United States Senator.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI.\r\n\r\nThe Anti-Racetrack Gambling Bill.\r\n\r\nSupporters of the Measure Knew What They Wanted, Drew a Bill to Meet the\r\nRequirements of the Situation and Refused to Compromise with the Machine\r\nElement - Suggestive Series of \"Errors\" Attended Its Passage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the three principal reform measures considered by the Legislature of\r\n1909 - the Direct Primary bill, the Railroad Regulation bill and the\r\nAnti-Racetrack Gambling bill - the last named was the only one to\r\nbecome a law untrimmed of its effective features. The Anti-Racetrack\r\nGambling bill passed the Assembly, passed the Senate and was signed by\r\nthe Governor precisely as it had been introduced; there was not so much\r\nas the change of a comma allowed. The result is an anti-gambling law on\r\nCalifornia statute books which if it work as well as it has in other\r\nStates will prevent bookmaking and pool-selling, thus relieving horse\r\nracing of the incubus which has made the sport of kings\r\ndisreputable[23].\r\n\r\nSince the reform element succeeded in passing the Anti-Racetrack\r\nGambling bill without amendment, there is widespread opinion that there\r\nwas no opposition to its passage. As a matter of fact, nothing is\r\nfarther from the truth. Before a legislator reached Sacramento, the\r\npro-gambling lobby was on the ground, and continued its hold-up process\r\nuntil the Assembly, by a vote of 67 to 10, passed the measure, and by a\r\nvote of 57 to 19 refused to grant it reconsideration.\r\n\r\nThe writer remembers his first poll of the Senate on the anti-gambling\r\nissue, when only nineteen Senators could be safely counted for it[24];\r\ntwenty-one were necessary for its passage. To be sure, a number of the\r\nSenators not included in the list of the nineteen who were from the\r\nbeginning safe for the measure, were pledged to vote for an anti-pool\r\nselling bill, but this did not necessarily mean the effective\r\nWalker-Otis bill which had been drawn to prevent pool selling and\r\nbookmaking. Not a few unquestionably figured on voting for a bill that\r\nwould place them on record as against racetrack gambling, but do\r\nracetrack gambling little or no harm.\r\n\r\nThese uncertain ones were blocked in their plan of action because the\r\nproponents of the Anti-Gambling bill knew just what they wanted to do,\r\nnamely, close up poolrooms and bookmakers' booths. They took the most\r\neffective way to close them up, namely, adapted to California\r\nConstitution and criminal practice, the Hughes anti-gambling law, the\r\nadoption of which Governor Hughes forced in New York, and which in New\r\nYork State had proved most effective.\r\n\r\nThe bill was drawn carefully and its backers in the Legislature and out\r\nof the Legislature let it be known that no amendment, not so much as to\r\nchange a comma, would be tolerated. The measure was introduced in the\r\nSenate by Walker of Santa Clara, and in the Assembly by Otis of Alameda.\r\nIt was known as the Walker-Otis bill.\r\n\r\nThis determined stand for the passage of the measure just as it had been\r\ndrawn thoroughly alarmed the gambling lobby. \"Reformers\" who would not\r\n\"compromise\" proved a new experience. The machine never compromises\r\nuntil it is whipped. Accordingly, when public opinion demanded action on\r\nthe Walker-Otis bill, the machine Senators began to talk of compromise.\r\nIn fact, up to the hour of the vote on the bill in the Senate, Senator\r\nWolfe did not stop whining compromise. In his speech against the passage\r\nof the bill, just before the final vote was taken he insisted: \"There\r\nshould have been a compromise measure agreed upon, a bill for which we\r\nall could have voted.\"\r\n\r\nThe moment before Wolfe had been warning the Senate that to pass the\r\nWalker-Otis bill would tend to wreck the Republican party in California.\r\nJust what the Walker-Otis bill had to do with Republican policies Mr.\r\nWolfe would no doubt have difficulty in answering. But the measure did\r\nhave much to do with machine policies. The machine had prevented the\r\npassage of the Anti-Gambling bill two years before, and was prepared to\r\nprevent the enactment of an effective anti-gambling law at the session\r\nof 1909. Senator Wolfe undoubtedly fell into the common error of\r\nmistaking the machine for the Republican party.\r\n\r\nHowever, the spirit of no compromise which gave Senator Wolfe so much\r\nconcern saved the Walker-Otis bill, and has given California an\r\neffective law. The lesson of the incident is that if effective laws are\r\nto be placed on the statute books, there can be no compromise with the\r\nmachine. There was compromise with the machine in the direct primary\r\nissue, with the result that the Direct Primary law is in many respects a\r\nsham. But that is another story to be told in another chapter. The\r\nanti-machine element did not compromise with the machine on the\r\nWalker-Otis bill, with the result that an effective law was passed.\r\n\r\n From the beginning, the anti-gambling element let it be known that no\r\nsuggestion of compromise would be entertained. They announced boldly\r\nthat if the machine succeeded in amending the measure, they, the\r\nanti-gambling Senators and Assemblymen, would work to prevent the\r\npassage of the amended bill. The position of these members of the\r\nLegislature who did not propose to be sidetracked by machine trickery is\r\nwell illustrated by an interview with Senator Walker, which appeared in\r\nthe Sacramento Bee on January 19.\r\n\r\n\"If the Hughes bill can not pass the California Legislature in the form\r\nthat it was passed in New York,\" said Senator Walker, \"I shall vote\r\nagainst the compromise or the amended bill. The people of California\r\nhave made clear their desire that an effective anti-gambling law, such\r\nas New York enjoys, be placed on the statute books. To substitute\r\nanything else would be betrayal.\"[25]\r\n\r\nSo there was no compromise with the machine on the Walker-Otis bill, and\r\nthe people were not betrayed, as they were to be later in the passage of\r\nthe Direct Primary bill and the, Railroad Regulation bill, where there\r\nwas compromise with the machine.\r\n\r\nWhen the machine found there was to be no compromise, a curious series\r\nof mishaps became the lot of the Walker-Otis bill, particularly in the\r\nSenate. The measure, when introduced, was, in the ordinary course of\r\nlegislation, referred to the Senate Committee on Public Morals. But it\r\ndid not reach that committee until several days after its introduction.\r\nWhen the discovery was made that it had not reached the committee, a\r\nsensation budded but never bloomed. The facts, however, were brought out\r\nthat the measure had been reposing in the pocket of a clerk instead of\r\ngoing to the committee. This \"error\" was corrected, and the bill turned\r\nover to its proper custodians.\r\n\r\nThen came the discovery that the bill had not been properly printed;\r\nthree words had been left out of the printed bill in the State printer's\r\noffice. This \"error,\" as soon as discovered by Senator Walker, was\r\ncorrected. It was declared to be \"trivial.\" But the \"trivial\"\r\ntypographical and clerical errors in the Direct Primary bill in the\r\nfinal count gave the machine its opportunity to amend the measure to\r\nmachine liking. The writer has no doubt in his own mind that the machine\r\naimed to delay the passage of the Walker-Otis bill until the end of the\r\nsession, as it did the Direct Primary bill, and then amend it to suit\r\nmachine purposes or defeat it altogether.\r\n\r\nError even attended the recording of the passage of the bill. After a\r\nmeasure has passed the Senate, its title must be read and approved, and\r\nan order made transmitting it to the Assembly, all of which must be\r\nrecorded in the Senate journal. The printed Senate journal of February\r\n4, however, the day the bill was passed, merely recorded the passage of\r\nthe bill. Nothing appeared about its title having been read, or that it\r\nhad been transmitted to the Assembly. Walker discovered this \"error,\"\r\nand a hasty inspection of the original minutes followed. The original\r\nminutes contained the proper record as follows: \"Title read and\r\napproved. Bill ordered transmitted to the Assembly.\" But the two\r\nsentences had been omitted from the printed journal. The patient Walker\r\nhad the correction made. None of these irregularities, however, resulted\r\nin serious delay. Those behind the measure watched their opponents\r\nclosely, refused utterly to treat them with the \"courtesy due Senators,\"\r\nin fact, acted under the assumption that the gambling element would stop\r\nat nothing to defeat the bill. This watchfulness is an important\r\nalthough comparatively minor reason why the bill was passed.\r\n\r\nThen came the machine's move to pass \"an anti gambling bill\" as a\r\nsubstitute for the Walker-Otis measure. Martinelli in the Senate and\r\nButler in the Assembly had introduced an Anti-Pool Selling, Anti-Book\r\nMaking bill. The measure had much to commend it but was by no means so\r\neffective as the Walker-Otis bill. As a last straw, the gambling element\r\ngrasped at the Martinelli-Butler bill, and threw their influence on the\r\nside of its passage. But here they again met with the uncompromising\r\nresistance of the reform element. There was nothing left for the machine\r\nto do but make its fight on the floor of Senate and of Assembly. And the\r\nfight came on in a way and with a suddenness which brought consternation\r\nupon the machine forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[23] The Walker-Otis bill is in full as follows:\r\n\r\nSection 1. A new section is hereby added to the Penal Code to be known\r\nas Section three hundred and thirty-seven a thereof and to read as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\naye. Every person, who engages in pool selling or bookmaking at any time\r\nor place; or who keeps or occupies any room, shed, tenement, tent,\r\nbooth, or building, float or vessel, or any part thereof, or who\r\noccupies any place or stand of any kind, upon any public or private\r\ngrounds within this State, with books, papers, apparatus or\r\nparaphernalia, for the purpose of recording or registering bets or\r\nwagers, or of selling pools, or who records or registers bets or wagers,\r\nor sells pools, upon the result of any trial or contest of skill, speed\r\nor power of endurance, of man or beast or between men or beasts, or upon\r\nthe result of any lot, chance, casualty, unknown or contingent event\r\nwhatsoever; or who receives, registers, records or forwards, or purports\r\nor pretends to receive, register, record or forward, in any manner\r\nwhatsoever, any money, thing or consideration of value, bet or wagered,\r\nor offered for the purpose of being bet or wagered, by or for any other\r\nperson, or sells pools, upon any such result; or who, being the owner,\r\nlessee, or occupant of any room, shed, tenement, tent, booth or\r\nbuilding, float or vessel, or part thereof, or of any grounds within\r\nthis State, knowingly permits the same to be used or occupied for any of\r\nthese purposes, or therein keeps, exhibits or employs any device or\r\napparatus for the purpose of recording or registering such bets or\r\nwagers, or the selling of such pools, or becomes the custodian or\r\ndepositary for gain, hire or reward of any money, property or thing of\r\nvalue, staked, wagered or pledged, or to be wagered or pledged upon any\r\nsuch result; or who aids, assists or abets in any manner in any of the\r\nsaid acts, which are hereby forbidden, is punishable by imprisonment in\r\na county jail or State prison for a period of not less than thirty days\r\nand not exceeding one year.\r\n\r\n[24] Had not the people of the Twenty-ninth and Thirty-first Senatorial\r\nDistricts revolted against the machine at the general election of 1908,\r\nthe Walker-Otis bill would probably have been defeated in the Senate. In\r\nthe chapter dealing with the passage of the Miller-Drew Reciprocal\r\nDemurrage bill, it will be shown how the Democratic Senators Holohan and\r\nCampbell were elected in the Republican Twenty-ninth and Thirty-first\r\nSenatorial Districts, not because they were Democrats, but because the\r\nRepublicans of those districts, recognizing the real issue before the\r\nState - the machine against the anti-machine element - voted for Holohan\r\nand Campbell, knowing them to be for good government and a \"square deal\"\r\nfor all. Holohan and Campbell were from the beginning foremost in their\r\nsupport of the Anti-Racetrack Gambling bill. To be sure, at the final\r\nvote, only seven Senators voted against the measure. But it is generally\r\nconceded that when the session opened, the gamblers had nineteen\r\nSenators who could have been prevailed upon to vote against an effective\r\nanti-gambling bill. Had machine men sat in the seats occupied by Holohan\r\nand Campbell, the gamblers would have had twenty-one votes in the\r\nSenate, and the Walker-Otis bill would have been defeated.\r\n\r\n[25] Much of the credit for this determined stand is due Earl H. Webb,\r\npresident of the Anti-Racetrack Gambling League, who managed the fight\r\nfor effective anti-racetrack gambling legislation not only during the\r\nsession of the Legislature, but before the Legislature convened. Mr.\r\nWebb first convinced himself that the Walker-Otis bill would stop pool\r\nselling and bookmaking; and that the measure would stand the test of\r\nhonest interpretation by the courts. Then he made his fight for it. To\r\nMr. Webb, more than to any other one person, is due the credit for its\r\npassage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VII.\r\n\r\nPassage of the Walker-Otis Bill.\r\n\r\nAnti-Machine Element Forced the Issue and Compelled Early Action on the\r\nMeasure - Evidence That Machine Planned to Defeat or Amend the Bill by\r\nDelaying Its Passage Until Toward the End of the Session.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs one looks back over the exciting first five weeks of the session,\r\nwhen the Walker-Otis bill was under consideration, it is plain that the\r\nmachine would have preferred to have made its initial fight in the\r\nSenate. If defeated in the Senate, the enemies of the measure could have\r\njockeyed for delay, prevented the passage of the measure until the\r\nclosing hours of the session, and then killed it or forced its\r\nsupporters to accept amendments.\r\n\r\nBut the initial fight did not come in the Senate. The Assembly was the\r\nbattle-ground. The reason for this lies principally in the fact that\r\nwhile Assemblyman W. B. Griffiths, of Napa, raises fast horses, he is not\r\na gambler, and is as much opposed to the bookmaking, pool-selling\r\nfeatures of the track as Senator Walker himself. Griffiths was made\r\nchairman of the Assembly Committee on Public Morals. While this\r\ncommittee has sundry sins to answer for, nevertheless it made an\r\nastonishingly clean record on the Walker-Otis bill. On January 18, less\r\nthan three weeks after the Legislature had assembled, Chairman Griffiths\r\ncalled his committee together to take up the Walker-Otis bill.\r\n\r\nOf the nine members of the committee, seven were present, Mott and\r\nMendenhall alone failing to answer to their names. Those present were:\r\nGriffiths, Cattell, Young, Dean, Perine, Fleisher and Wilson. The seven\r\nmembers went through the bill paragraph by paragraph and decided\r\nunanimously to recommend it for passage.\r\n\r\nHad a dynamite bomb been set off under the Emeryville gambling\r\nestablishment, greater consternation could scarcely have seized upon the\r\npro-gambling element. The gamblers realized that the committee's prompt\r\naction threatened the machine's plan to delay action on the measure\r\nuntil the closing days of the session. For the moment all interest\r\ncentered in Mott and Mendenhall, the two members of the committee who\r\nhad been absent when the measure had been considered. Twenty-four hours\r\ndeveloped the fact that Mendenhall sanctioned the action of his seven\r\nassociates. This made eight of the nine committeemen for the bill. But\r\nthe ninth member, Assemblyman Mott of Alameda County, was very much\r\noffended at what the committee had done.\r\n\r\nAssemblyman Mott was elected as a Lincoln-Roosevelt League member.\r\nProbably the Lincoln-Roosevelt League does not like to be reminded of\r\nthat unfortunate fact. But the lesson of Mr. Mott is so necessary for\r\nthe Lincoln-Roosevelt League and all other reform movements that the\r\nconspicuous part which Mott played against reform policies cannot be too\r\nmuch insisted upon. To be sure, Mr. Mott voted for the bill when it was\r\nup for passage - the Lincoln-Roosevelt Republican platform of his county\r\npledged him to it. But there is a deal of difference between supporting\r\na measure and voting for it[26].\r\n\r\nMott was very much offended at what the committee had done and demanded\r\nthat another meeting be held. Such a meeting, to accommodate Mr. Mott,\r\nwas held - held in the office of Speaker Phil Stanton; held behind\r\nclosed doors; held with Jerk Burke, Southern Pacific lobbyist, safely\r\nentrenched across the hall from Speaker Stanton's office in the back\r\noffice of Sergeant-at-Arms Stafford[27].\r\n\r\nBut Mott failed to change the position of his eight associates. The\r\nfurther consideration of the measure by the committee which he demanded\r\nwas denied. He accordingly took the fight for reconsideration to the\r\nfloor of the Assembly. The fact that eight of the committee were against\r\nhim, apparently had no weight at all with Mr. Mott.\r\n\r\nFailing to force the committee to reconsider its action in recommending\r\nthat the bill pass, Mott told his troubles to the Assembly. In the\r\nAssembly Mott moved that the measure be re-referred to the Committee on\r\nPublic Morals, eight members of which had joined in recommending that it\r\n\"do pass.\"\r\n\r\nThe motion was lost by a vote of 53 to 23. This was recognized as the\r\ntest vote in the Assembly on the Anti Racetrack Gambling bill. That the\r\nopponents of the bill failed to make a better showing fairly paralyzed\r\nthe pro-gambling lobby. Mott, chagrined and discomfited, retired in\r\nconfusion[28].\r\n\r\nAssemblyman Gibbons managed at this point to tie the bill up for another\r\nday, by giving notice that on the day following, he would move that the\r\nvote by which the bill was refused reference to the Committee on Public\r\nMorals be reconsidered. The day following Mr. Gibbons made his motion\r\nbut was voted down, thirty Assemblymen supporting and forty-eight\r\nopposing him[29].\r\n\r\nThe Gibbons motion having been disposed of, Assemblyman Butler moved to\r\namend the measure, by substituting for it the Martinelli-Butler bill.\r\nBut again did the anti-gambling element force the issue. The motion was\r\nlost by a vote of 23 to 52.\r\n\r\nOther proposed amendments having been voted down, Mr. Otis moved that\r\nthe bill be put on its passage the next day, January 21. This was a\r\nfinal blow at the machine's purpose to delay the passage of the bill as\r\nlong as possible, and was met with determined opposition. But the motion\r\nprevailed by a vote of 44 to 32.\r\n\r\nThe bill was on the following day put upon its final passage. The writer\r\nconsiders the real test vote on the bill was cast on Mott's motion to\r\nrefer the measure back to the Committee on Public Morals. The vote on\r\nthe passage of the measure counts for little under the circumstances.\r\nSixty-seven Assemblymen voted for it; only ten - and every one of them\r\nfrom San Francisco - voted against it.\r\n\r\nBy consulting the table showing the six votes on this bill - Table \"D\"\r\nof the appendix - it will be seen that eleven of the twenty-three\r\nAssemblymen who voted for Mott's motion to refer the measure back to the\r\nCommittee on Public Morals voted for its final passage. Two, Baxter and\r\nSchmitt, who had voted for the Mott resolution, were absent when the\r\nfinal vote on the bill was taken, leaving only ten who had voted for the\r\nMott resolution to vote against the bill. The eleven who had voted for\r\nMott's motion, but who switched to safety when the vote on the bill's\r\npassage came, were: Beardslee, Greer, Johnson of Sacramento[30], Johnson\r\nof San Diego, Johnston of Contra Costa, Moore, Mott, Nelson, Odom,\r\nWagner, Webber - 11.\r\n\r\nThere was just one more parliamentary move by which the Walker-Otis bill\r\ncould be delayed in the Assembly, to give notice of a motion to\r\nreconsider the vote by which the measure had been passed. Grove L.\r\nJohnson came to the rescue with the notice. This tied the bill up for\r\nanother twenty-four hours. On the 2nd Johnson made his motion to\r\nreconsider but was defeated by a vote of nineteen to fifty-seven.\r\n\r\nThe table of the six votes on the Walker-Otis bill shows at a glance who\r\nvoted consistently for the measure on all of the numerous roll calls;\r\nwho voted consistently against it; and who were pulled backward and\r\nforward, voting one moment to satisfy the public demand that the bill be\r\npassed, and the next on the side of the gambling interests[31].\r\n\r\nPublic opinion was running high for the passage of the Walker-Otis bill\r\nby the time the measure reached the Senate, after passing the Assembly,\r\nbut the bill might still have been held up in the Senate committee[32]\r\nhad it not been for the ridiculous attack which Tom Williams, president\r\nof the California jockey Club, made upon all who supported the measure,\r\nor all who Williams thought supported it.\r\n\r\nThe occasion was a public hearing before the Senate Committee on Public\r\nMorals, at which Williams was asked to present the side of the opponents\r\nof the bill. The crowd that filled the Senate chamber expected from\r\nWilliams some reasons why the measure should be denied passage, but it\r\nwas disappointed.\r\n\r\nInstead of giving reasons in support of his position, Williams\r\nintroduced the methods of the barroom into the Senate chamber. He\r\ndramatically gave Rev. Frank K. Baker, of Sacramento, the lie, under\r\nconditions which stamped Williams as a bully and a coward. His\r\nuncalled-for attack on Dr. Baker would have killed his argument, but not\r\ncontent with this, he made probably the most astounding attack on the\r\nProtestant clergy of the country ever heard in California, certainly the\r\nmost astonishing ever heard in the Senate chamber of the State[33].\r\n\r\nThe racetrack man's tirade did not give the reasons for continuance of\r\ngambling, which the people expected to hear from him.  Finally, when\r\nWilliams was swamped by questions which his insolence and tactlessness\r\nhad provoked, Senator Frank Leavitt came to his rescue by moving\r\nadjournment. Leavitt's motion prevailed, but not until Williams had\r\neffectively settled the fate of the Walker-Otis bill.\r\n\r\nThe Committee on Public Morals reported the bill back the next day with\r\nthe recommendation that it do not pass. The recommendation was that of\r\nWeed, Wolfe and Leavitt. While Kennedy and Savage failed to vote for the\r\nrecommendation, they made no minority report. But even with the\r\nunfavorable report, the measure passed the Senate by a vote of 33 to 7.\r\nIn the eleventh hour, uncertain Senators like Welch joined the winning\r\nside, but the showing made by the gamblers was, all things considered,\r\nbetter than could have been expected[34].\r\n\r\nIn the Senate and Assembly, out of a total vote of 120, the gambling\r\nelement, which had year after year succeeded in preventing the passage\r\nof an anti-racetrack gambling bill, commanded on the measure's final\r\npassage but seventeen votes. The incident illustrates what aroused\r\npublic opinion, when it finds expression in a definite plan of action,\r\ncan compel.\r\n\r\nBut even with the measure's final passage, the delays that attended it\r\ncontinued. It passed the Senate on Thursday, February 4. By the\r\nfollowing Saturday, the measure had been correctly engrossed, but could\r\nnot go to the Governor until it had received the signature of Speaker\r\nStanton of the Assembly. Stanton was out of town. As a result, it was\r\nFebruary 10, six days after it had passed the Senate, before it went to\r\nthe Governor. Governor Gillett took nine days to sign it, the Senate\r\nHistory showing that it was approved on February 19. Because of the\r\ndelays the gamblers were enabled to complete their season at the\r\nEmeryville track.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[26] Of the six votes taken in the Assembly on the Walker-Otis bill\r\nissue, Mott in effect voted four times against the immediate passage of\r\nthe measure. See Table \"D.\"\r\n\r\n[27] It was Jerk Burke's first appearance at the capital for the\r\nsession. The danger which threatened the gambling element brought to the\r\ncapital every machine lobbyist within reach, from Frank Daroux down. It\r\nwas an anxious hour for the machine.\r\n\r\n[28] This first test vote in the Assembly on the Walker-Otis bill was as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nFor Mott's motion, and in effect against the bill: Baxter, Beardslee,\r\nBeban, Black, Coghlan, Collum, Cullen, Greer, Hopkins, Johnson of\r\nSacramento (Grove L.), Johnson of San Diego, Johnston of Contra Costa,\r\nMacauley, McManus, Moore, Mott, Nelson, Odom, O'Neil, Pugh, Schmitt,\r\nWagner, Webber. - 23.\r\n\r\nAgainst Mott's motion, and in effect for the bill: Barndollar, Bratty,\r\nBohnett, Butler, Callan, Cattell, Collier, Costar, Cronin, Dean, Drew,\r\nFlavelle, Fleisher, Flint, Gerdes, Gibbons, Gillis, Griffiths, Hammon,\r\nHanlon, Hans. Hawk, Hayes, Hewitt, Hinkle, Holmquist, Irwin, Johnson of\r\nPlacer, Juilliard, Kiwi, Leeds, Lightner, Maher, McClellan, Melrose,\r\nMendenhall, Otis, Perine, Polsley, Preston, Pulcifer, Rech, Rutherford,\r\nSackett, Silver, Stanton, Stuckenbruck, Telfer, Transue, Whitney,\r\nWilson, Wylie, Young - 53.\r\n\r\n[29] The several votes taken on the Walker-Otis bill will be found In\r\nthe table \"D\" of the appendix.\r\n\r\n[30] Johnson of Sacramento voted for the bill to give notice that he\r\nwould the next day move for its reconsideration. Reconsideration can be\r\nsecured only by a member voting with the majority. Had Johnson voted\r\nagainst the bill he could not have secured its reconsideration.\r\n\r\n[31] Attention is called to the vote on reconsideration of Assemblyman\r\nFeeley, of Alameda, another Lincoln-Roosevelt member Mr. Feeley was\r\nabsent when the vote on Mott's motion was taken. But Mr. Feeley voted\r\nfor the bill when it was on final passage, thus keeping his record\r\nstraight. But Mr. Feeley hastened to vote for reconsideration of the\r\nmeasure.\r\n\r\nMr. Feeley, like Mr. Mott, was nominated by the Lincoln-Roosevelt League\r\nbecause he could be elected. Mr. Feeley furnishes another example of the\r\nfolly of which reformers are sometimes guilty, of nominating men whose\r\nbest recommendation seems to be that they can be elected. To be elected\r\nis very important, to be sure; but if a man when elected to the\r\nLegislature is to vote against reform policies, why should the\r\nanti-machine element nominate him, thereby losing all the chance they,\r\nmight have had of electing a man who would be in sympathy with their\r\nendeavors?\r\n\r\n[32] In 1907, a measure similar to the Walker-Otis bill was killed in\r\nthis way. It passed the Assembly and was in the Senate referred to the\r\nSenate Committee on Public Morals. The committee refused to report it\r\nback to the Senate, and friends of the measure could not secure enough\r\nvotes on the floor of the Senate to compel the committee to act. The\r\ncommittee (1907) consisted of Senators Irish, Leavitt, Lynch, Wolfe and\r\nKennedy. Irish and Lynch did not sit in the Senate of 1909, and could\r\nnot be reappointed to the committee. But Lieutenant- Governor Porter\r\ndistinguished himself by reappointing to the committee Wolfe, Leavitt\r\nand Kennedy. Weed and Savage were added to take the places left vacant\r\nby Irish and Lynch. Weed in 1907 voted with Leavitt, Wolfe and Kennedy\r\nagainst compelling the committee to release the Anti-Racetrack Gambling\r\nbill. Senator Savage (1907) voted for the bill's release, but Senator\r\nSavage at the opening of the session of 1909, was at least counted as\r\nopposed to the Walker-Otis bill. The gambling element had no complaint\r\nto make of the Committee on Public Morals which Lieutenant- Governor\r\nPorter had appointed.\r\n\r\n[33] Williams was not the only gambler who injured the gamblers' cause\r\nthat night. Frank Daroux, keeper of the notorious Sausalito poolrooms,\r\ninterrupted A. J. Treat, of Sausalito, who was speaking for the\r\nWalker-Otis bill, to demand of him how it is that at the polls the\r\ngamblers of that city invariably defeat the anti-gambling element.\r\n\r\n\"You will remember, Mr. Daroux,\" came back Treat, \"that at the last\r\ngeneral election you and I discussed that question?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\n\"And I asked you why you were in politics?\" continued Treat.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Daroux.\r\n\r\n\"And you told me,\" insisted Treat, \"that you were in politics for\r\nprinciple.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" admitted the pool seller.\r\n\r\n\"And I asked you how you spelt it then; and I ask you how you spell it\r\nnow?\"\r\n\r\nThe crowd that packed the Senate Chamber, even the scores of racetrack\r\ntouts that had been rushed to Sacramento to give weight to the side of\r\nthe gamblers, went wild at this. Treat was cheered to the echo. Daroux\r\nslunk back into his seat silenced and was not heard from again the whole\r\nevening.\r\n\r\n[34] The vote was as follows:\r\n\r\nFor the bill: Anthony, Bates, Bell, Bills, Birdsall, Black, Boynton,\r\nBurnett, Caminetti, Campbell, Cartwright, Curtin, Cutten, Estudillo,\r\nHolohan, Hurd, Kennedy, Lewis, Martinelli, McCartney, Miller, Price,\r\nRoseberry, Rush, Sanford, Savage, Stetson, Strobridge, Thompson, Walker,\r\nWelch, Willis, Wright - 33.\r\n\r\nAgainst the bill: Finn, Hare, Hartman, Leavitt, Reily, Weed, Wolfe - 7.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VIII.\r\n\r\nThe Direct Primary Bill.\r\n\r\nParallel Between It and the Walker-Otis Bill - Attempt to Placate the\r\nMachine Weakened Position of Its Supporters - Most Serious Criticism\r\nCame from Advocates of the Direct Primary Idea - What the Original\r\nMeasure Provided - Machine's Plan of Campaign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe parallel between the Walker-Otis Anti-Racetrack Gambling bill and\r\nthe Wright-Stanton Direct Primary bill furnishes the most suggestive\r\nfeature of the Legislative session. Each was based on a demand of a\r\nlarge majority of the people of the State for the correction of an\r\nabuse; the one to prevent the prostitution of the race-course in the\r\ninterest of the gambling element; the second to prevent the domination\r\nin public affairs of the corrupt, corporation-backed political boss.\r\n\r\nEach had been discussed in the public prints for months previous to the\r\nconvening of the Legislature, and each had been made in the popular view\r\nof affairs a sort of test by which the Legislature was to be judged.\r\n\r\nEach had the support of not only the better element of electors, but the\r\nbetter element of each House of the Legislature. Each had the determined\r\nsecret opposition, and so far as it dared, the open opposition of the\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\nThe campaign which the machine planned against the bills was practically\r\nthe same in each instance - to amend the measures into a condition of\r\nineffectiveness, and then pass them as sop to The People. This would\r\nhave given The People a Direct Primary law without a direct primary; an\r\nAnti-Gambling law that would neither close poolrooms nor interfere with\r\nbookmaking.\r\n\r\nAnd here the parallel ends.\r\n\r\nThe proponents of the Anti-Gambling bill introduced an Anti-Gambling\r\nmeasure, showed that it was the best that could be drawn, and let it be\r\nknown that they (the supporters of the measure) would, if it were\r\namended by the machine, vote against it.\r\n\r\nThe proponents of the Direct Primary bill, on the other hand, seemed\r\npossessed of the notion that they must placate the machine if any Direct\r\nPrimary bill were to be passed.\r\n\r\nThe backers of the Anti-Gambling bill treated the machine leaders as\r\nrecognized enemies of the measure, with whom there could be no\r\ncompromise. The backers of the Direct Primary bill treated the machine\r\nleaders as friends and allies, inviting them to offer suggestion and\r\nadvice.\r\n\r\nThe results of the two campaigns speak for the effectiveness of the two\r\nmethods. The Anti-Gambling element put through an effective\r\nAnti-Gambling bill, refusing to compromise on so much as the change of a\r\ncomma. But in the case of the Direct Primary bill, the machine not only\r\nhad the last word, but in the feature of the nomination of United States\r\nSenators, the real bone of contention, amended the measure very much to\r\nits liking.\r\n\r\nLong before the Legislature convened it was common talk at San Francisco\r\nthat the backers of the Direct Primary bill were willing to accept any\r\nsort of a bill, so long as a direct primary measure be passed. Inasmuch\r\nas it is quite possible that a legislative enactment called Direct\r\nPrimary law may be a trifle worse than no Direct Primary law at all, the\r\njelly-fish attitude of the leaders in the movement caused no little\r\nunfavorable comment.\r\n\r\nIt did not seem to occur to the self-constituted leaders that their\r\nproper course was to draw up the most effective measure possible, let\r\nits effectiveness be known to the people - as was done in the case of\r\nthe Anti-Gambling bill - and insist that the Legislature go on record\r\nfor or against it.\r\n\r\nInstead, they endeavored to satisfy everybody, apparently attempted to\r\ncome to a compromise understanding with the machine, or at least to\r\nplease machine leaders. Their theory seemed to be that if the measure\r\nwere not made too effective, the machine would not seriously oppose its\r\npassage, thus insuring a glorious and at the same time, easy victory.\r\n\r\nHowever unwarranted this assumption from appearances may be, such\r\nhidebound machine men as Wolfe and Leavitt were consulted and flattered,\r\napparently with the idea that although they had been abused like\r\npickpockets on previous occasions, they could be won over to the Direct\r\nPrimary cause.\r\n\r\nThe stupidity of this policy was shown at the end of the session, when\r\nWolfe and Leavitt dictated the terms under which the Direct Primary bill\r\nshould pass. Had the supporters of the Anti-Gambling bill pursued the\r\nsame policy, and treated the machine leaders as possible friends instead\r\nof recognized enemies, Wolfe, Leavitt and the other machine leaders\r\nwould unquestionably have dictated the provisions of the Anti-Gambling\r\nbill, and have forced that compromise which Wolfe in his speech on the\r\nWalker-Otis bill regretted so bitterly had not been made.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Direct Primary is primarily to take away from the\r\npolitical bosses the monopoly which the convention system gives them in\r\nnaming candidates for office, and to place such nomination in the hands\r\nof The People. To this end, under the Direct Primary laws that have of\r\nrecent years been adopted, the boss-controlled convention is done away\r\nwith, and the candidate for office nominated by the direct vote of The\r\nPeople.\r\n\r\nThe play of the machine was to make the direct nomination difficult and\r\nimpracticable and, if possible, entirely ineffective. The real\r\nsupporters of the Direct Primary idea aimed to make the nomination as\r\nsimple as possible, and easily attained, that genuine expression of the\r\nchoice of the electors could be secured.\r\n\r\nBut instead of aiming at simplicity and direct methods, the Direct\r\nPrimary bill, introduced in the Senate by Wright and in the Assembly by\r\nStanton[35], threw a confusing mass of partisan detail about the\r\nselection of the primary candidate. It was made practically impossible\r\nfor an independent citizen believing in the principles of a given party,\r\nbut withholding his right to exercise the citizen's judgment at the\r\npolls, to become a primary candidate. Throughout, the measure made it\r\nsmooth sailing for the mere partisan and extremely hard for independent\r\nRepublican or independent Democrat to secure party nomination[35a].\r\n\r\nFor example, the candidate for party nomination, was, according to the\r\nterms of the bill, required not only to set forth the name of the party\r\nunder which he might seek nomination, but to make affidavit \"that he\r\naffiliated with said party at the last preceding general election, and\r\neither that he did not vote thereat, or voted for a majority of the\r\ncandidates of said party at said next preceding general election, and\r\nintends to so vote at the ensuing election.\"\r\n\r\nThus, no citizen who had not supported the majority of his party\r\ncandidates at the previous election, and who was unwilling to take an\r\noath before their nomination, to support a majority of the candidates at\r\nthe next ensuing election, was to be eligible for primary nomination to\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nBut this, and similar unfortunate provisions were practically lost sight\r\nof in the fight made over the provisions for the nomination of United\r\nStates Senators, and remained in the measure as it was finally enacted\r\ninto law.\r\n\r\nIt may be, as the machine element contends, that provision for the\r\nnomination of United States Senators has no place in a Direct Primary\r\nlaw, but the fact remains that The People have inseparably linked with\r\nthe direct primary idea the selection of United States Senators by\r\ndirect vote.\r\n\r\nThe Federal laws provide that United States Senators shall be elected by\r\nthe Legislature. But in States where Direct Primary laws have been\r\nadopted, provisions have been made by which the names of candidates for\r\nthe United States Senate are placed on the primary ballot the same as\r\nthe name of any other candidate for a State office. The same Direct\r\nPrimary laws give candidates for the Legislature opportunity to pledge\r\nthemselves to accept The People's decision, and as members of the\r\nLegislature to cast their votes for such candidate for the United States\r\nSenate as The People may have named.\r\n\r\nThe Legislature is thus made to abide by The People's will in electing\r\nUnited States Senators, precisely as the Electoral College is made to\r\nabide by The People's will in the election of the President.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, no candidate for the Legislature need take the pledge if he\r\ndoes not care to do so, but it is recognized that where it is possible\r\nfor the voter to express a choice for United States Senator, the\r\nlegislative candidate who fails to pledge himself to respect The\r\nPeople's choice would stand slim chances of election.\r\n\r\nThe Direct Primary law adopted by Oregon[35b] represents the highest\r\ndevelopment of the plan for popular selection of United States Senators.\r\nIn that State the candidate for the United States Senate is nominated\r\nthe same as any other candidate, the names of each successful primary\r\nnominee going on the regular ballot the same as that of any candidate\r\nfor State office.\r\n\r\nThe Senatorial candidate who receives the highest number of votes is\r\nnot, of course, elected to the United States Senate, but candidates to\r\nthe Legislature are given opportunity to pledge themselves to respect\r\nthe wishes of the voters and elect to the Senate the candidate who is\r\nthus endorsed. The Legislative candidate may sign such a pledge, or he\r\nmay sign a statement that he will regard the popular vote for United\r\nStates Senator as merely advisory and not binding.\r\n\r\nBut it is noticeable that in Oregon and other States where such\r\nwholesome direct primary measures have become laws the legislative\r\ncandidate signs the pledge to abide by the mandate of the electors.\r\n\r\nUnquestionably The People of California expected some such provision in\r\nthe California Direct Primary law. Unfortunately, however, Senator\r\nWright, who had charge of the bill, is not at all in sympathy with the\r\nOregon plan. It is claimed that the framers of the bill were as little\r\nin sympathy with the Oregon plan as Senator Wright himself. At any rate,\r\nthe bill, as a sort of compromise, gave the electors opportunity to\r\nexpress their choice for United States Senator within party lines. The\r\ncandidate for the Legislature was to be given opportunity to pledge\r\nhimself to abide, not by the selection of the electors of the State, but\r\nby the selection of the electors of his party[36].\r\n\r\nThe name of a candidate for the United States Senate did not, under the\r\noriginal Wright-Stanton bill, go on the final ticket. His choice was\r\nconfined to the primaries and was at best to be regarded only by the\r\nlegislators of his own political faith. The People of California were\r\nnot to be given a direct vote in the selection of United States\r\nSenators, as are The People of Oregon.\r\n\r\nIf the framers of the Wright-Stanton Primary bill thought that their\r\ncompromise on the United States Senator feature of the measure would\r\nplacate the machine, they were much disappointed. The machine fought the\r\narrangement for popular selection of United States Senators within party\r\nlines as positively as it would have combated the Oregon plan itself.\r\n\r\nUnder either plan, the machine recognized there was always danger that\r\nthe selection of a United States Senator would actually be made by The\r\nPeople. This would mean loss to the machine of Federal patronage, and\r\nFederal patronage is the sure rock upon which the machine in California\r\nis founded. Indeed, had either plan been incorporated into law, the\r\nre-election of Senator Frank Flint would have been made practically\r\nimpossible. So the machine fought the Wright-Stanton plan as stubbornly\r\nas it would have opposed the Oregon plan.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the best supporters of the Direct Primary idea were\r\nmuch disappointed that the Oregon plan had not been incorporated into\r\nthe bill. Not a few of them grew lukewarm in their support of the\r\nmeasure. The extreme partisanship of its provisions and the failure to\r\nprovide for popular selection of United States Senators hurt the measure\r\nwith its friends, and failed to placate its enemies. From the beginning\r\nthe most effective arguments against the bill were found in the bill\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThis was demonstrated at the public hearing, held January 26th, to\r\nconsider the various provisions of the measure. The principal speakers\r\nwere Hiram Johnson and Judge John F. Davis.\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson dealt with the Direct Primary in a general way. He spoke of\r\nit in its relation to practical politics, showing that an effective\r\nDirect Primary would place this Government of ours back into the hands\r\nof The People. That is what was wanted. Every point Johnson made was\r\nreceived with applause from the crowd that packed the Senate Chamber.\r\nAnd when Johnson concluded with an appeal for \"a Direct Primary law that\r\nshall be a Direct Primary law in substance and not in form alone,\" he\r\nwas cheered to the echo.\r\n\r\nJudge Davis was not so fortunate in his text as was Mr. Johnson. Davis\r\nwas there to discuss the details of the bill. He had scarcely begun\r\nbefore he found himself between a cross fire of questions from those on\r\nthe one side who wanted an effective measure passed and on the other\r\nfrom those who wanted no Direct Primary at all. The opponents of the\r\nDirect Primary scored few points; the believers in the measure did.\r\n\r\nTo save himself from a ridiculous position, Davis had to evade the\r\nquestion whether he would rather see an able and effective Democrat\r\nelected to the United States Senate than a vicious and corrupt\r\nRepublican. He failed as miserably in attempting to justify the extreme\r\npartisan features of the bill. And the questions which Judge Davis could\r\nnot answer came from men who wanted to see an effective Direct Primary\r\nmeasure enacted, not from the opponents of the Direct Primary theory.\r\n\r\nOf course this dissatisfaction of the advocates of an effective law\r\nencouraged the machine to action. The measure was deliberately left with\r\nthe Committee on Election Laws. The Anti-Gambling bill had passed both\r\nHouses by February 4th, one month after the session had opened. But on\r\nthat date, the Committee had just begun consideration of the measure. To\r\nbe sure, the Election Laws Committee had been stacked against the Direct\r\nPrimary bill, but the Public Morals Committee had been stacked against\r\nthe Anti-Gambling bill as well. But the opponents of racetrack gambling\r\nwere satisfied with the Walker-Otis bill, while the proponents of the\r\nDirect Primary for California were by no means satisfied with the\r\nWright-Stanton bill.\r\n\r\nSo the machine dared do with the Direct Primary bill what it did not\r\ndare do with the Anti-Gambling bill. The Walker-Otis bill had a standing\r\nwhich the Wright-Stanton bill did not have.\r\n\r\nThat the Committee on Election Laws did not act early in the session on\r\nthe Direct Primary bill was not because of the purpose of Senator\r\nEstudillo, Chairman of the Committee. Time after time did Estudillo call\r\nmeetings for consideration of the bill, and repeatedly, he found only\r\nhimself, and Senators Stetson and Wright in attendance. Finally, in\r\nFebruary, Senator Estudillo succeeded in getting his committee together\r\nfor consideration of the all-important measure.\r\n\r\nThat the machine proposed to make the bill inoperative was recognized\r\nfrom the moment the committee was called to order. The manner in which\r\nthis was to be done developed as rapidly. The machine's plan was as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n(1) As to candidates:\r\n\r\nThe machine proposed to amend the bill so that either a majority or a\r\nhigh plurality vote should be required to nominate candidates at the\r\nprimary election. In the event of no candidate for a given office\r\nreceiving a majority or the required plurality, the nomination was to be\r\nmade by a nominating convention as under the old convention system. With\r\nsuch a provision it would have been easy for the machine to introduce a\r\nlarge number of candidates at the primaries, thus making it\r\nimpracticable for any one of them to receive a majority or even a high\r\nplurality vote. This would have thrown nominations into a convention.\r\nThus, while the State would have had a Direct Primary law, it would have\r\nbeen practically impossible to nominate a candidate under its\r\nprovisions.\r\n\r\n(2) As to United States Senators:\r\n\r\nTo deny The People a voice in the election of United States Senators,\r\nthe machine had two plans:\r\n\r\n(A) To cut all provisions for the election of United States Senators out\r\nof the bill.\r\n\r\n(B) Failing in this, to amend the bill so that candidates for the\r\nLegislature would be required to regard the choice of the electors of\r\ntheir several districts as advisory. The vote was in no way to be held\r\nbinding, nor was a legislative candidate to be required to sign a pledge\r\nto regard in any way the wishes of the electors. Under this arrangement\r\nthere could be as high as 100 candidates for the United States Senate\r\nendorsed at a single election - eighty from Assembly, twenty from\r\nSenatorial districts. The effect would be, of course, the endorsement of\r\nat least several candidates, with the result that the Legislature would\r\nin the end be left to choose as under the present system. Thus, while\r\nthe State would have a law which apparently gave The People a voice in\r\nthe naming of Federal Senators, there would be no change whatever in the\r\nmanner in which the Federal Senators were nominated and elected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[35] In addition to the Wright-Stanton bill, Senator Roseberry\r\nintroduced a measure providing for a postal primary. In the appendix\r\nwill be found Senator Roseberry's views on the postal primary plan.\r\n\r\n[35a] The writer has been reliably informed that this concession was made\r\nto the machine before a member of the Legislature reached Sacramento.\r\n\r\n[35b] Senator Caminetti introduced a separate bill providing the Oregon\r\nplan for the popular choice of United States Senators. He was requested\r\nnot to press its passage BECAUSE IT MIGHT INJURE THE CHANCES OF PASSAGE\r\nOF THE DIRECT PRIMARY BILL. The machine claquers is never at a loss for\r\nan excuse for the defeat of a meritorious measure.\r\n\r\n[36] The original Wright-Stanton bill provided two pledges, which the\r\ncandidate for the Legislature was given opportunity to sign. The first\r\npledge bound him to abide by the choice of the electors of his party for\r\nUnited States Senator. It read as follows:\r\n\r\n\"I further declare to The People of California and to The People of the\r\n.......... (Senatorial or Assembly) District that during my term of\r\noffice, without regard to my individual preference, I will always vote\r\nfor that candidate for United States Senator in Congress who shall have\r\nreceived for that office the highest number of votes cast by my party at\r\nthe September primary election next preceding the election of a Senator\r\nin Congress.\"\r\n\r\nIf the legislative candidate did not care to sign this pledge, he was\r\ngiven the alternative of signing the following:\r\n\r\n\"I further declare to The People of California and to The People of the\r\n... (Senatorial or Assembly) District that during my term of office I shall\r\nconsider the vote of The People at any primary election for United\r\nStates Senator as nothing more than a recommendation, which I shall be\r\nat liberty wholly to disregard, if I see fit.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IX.\r\n\r\nMachine Defeated in the Senate.\r\n\r\nReform Forces, Regardless of Party, Unite to Secure the Passage of an\r\nEffective Direct Primary Law-Agree on a Compromise Measure and Succeed\r\nin Forcing It Through the Senate - Machine Badly Beaten.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSenator Leroy A. Wright of San Diego introduced the Direct Primary bill\r\nin the Senate on January 17th, and during the month that it slumbered in\r\nthe Senate Committee on Election Laws there was no reason to believe\r\nthat Senator Wright was not in sympathy with the provisions of the\r\nmeasure. On February 1st, however, Senator Wright made the astonishing\r\nconfession before the Committee on Election Laws that he was not in\r\nsympathy with that provision of his bill which gave legislative\r\ncandidates opportunity to pledge themselves to abide by the choice of\r\nthe electors of the State for United States Senator. From that moment\r\nbegan Senator Wright's fight against his own bill, which finally landed\r\nhim in the camp of Leavitt, Wolfe and the other machine Senators.\r\n\r\nAt the meeting of the Senate Committee on Election Laws, held February\r\n1st, the solid six on the Committee, Leavitt, Wolfe, Savage, Hartman,\r\nKennedy and Hare, had voted two amendments into the bill which rendered\r\nit absolutely useless for practical purposes.\r\n\r\nThe first amendment provided that a majority instead of a plurality vote\r\nshould nominate, a provision as unconstitutional as impracticable. The\r\nsecond amendment cut out of the measure all provision for popular vote\r\nfor United States Senators.\r\n\r\nThis decided action on the part of the machine had brought consternation\r\nupon Estudillo and Stetson who wanted to see an effective measure\r\npassed. Wright in this crisis took the floor to state his position.\r\n\r\n\"For my part,\" said Wright, \"I would never sign a pledge to vote for the\r\ncandidate for United States Senator in Congress who shall have received\r\nfor that office the highest number of votes cast by my party. I do\r\nbelieve, however, that the people of this State demand a partisan Direct\r\nPrimary law. But I think that the people of Oregon recognize that they\r\nhave made a mistake in going so far as they have. Under the pledge\r\nrequired of candidates for the Legislature in the measure before us (the\r\nWright bill) a member of the Legislature might find himself compelled to\r\nvote for a candidate whom the voters of his district opposed. I opposed\r\nthis provision when the bill was drawn, but my objection was overruled.\r\nI now stand for the bill as it has been introduced.\"\r\n\r\nWolfe, Leavitt and the rest of the machine Senators grinned exultantly\r\nas Wright stated that he did not approve the provisions of his own bill.\r\nBut the faces of Estudillo and of Stetson, who had been looking upon\r\nWright as their leader in the pro-primary fight, fell. To employ the\r\nfamous expression of Speaker Stanton of the Assembly, they felt the\r\nground slipping from under their feet. There was a sensation of farther\r\nslipping, when Wright, author of the measure, pro-primary leader and\r\nCall-heralded reformer, offered an amendment as substitute for popular\r\nState-wide choice for United States Senator, by making the vote for\r\nUnited States Senator advisory only[37].\r\n\r\nThe grin of satisfaction on the faces of the machine Senators broadened\r\nas Wright read his amendment while the faces of Estudillo and Stetson\r\ngrew blanker. But the machine Senators were in no hurry. Things were\r\ncoming their way; there was no reason for them to rush matters. So they\r\nlazily took twenty-four hours to think it over. Then they bluntly\r\nrejected Wright's compromise, the solid six, Wolfe, Leavitt, Savage,\r\nHartman, Kennedy and Hare voting against its acceptance.\r\n\r\nEstudillo and Stetson voted to accept the compromise. They explained\r\ntheir votes. Their explanations showed their earnestness in working for\r\nthe best Direct Primary measure that could be passed - which indicates\r\nwhat might have been done under other leadership - and a loyalty to\r\nWright, the accepted leader in the Direct Primary fight, which, to say\r\nthe least, was misplaced.\r\n\r\n\"With this amendment,\" said Senator Stetson, in explaining his vote,\r\n\"the bill is not one-half so strong as it was before. I do not like it.\r\nBut I must train with one side or with the other, and for that reason\r\nshall vote for Senator Wright's substitute.\"\r\n\r\nSenator Estudillo stated that he voted for the amendment against his\r\nbetter judgment.\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe in your amendment, Senator Wright,\" said Estudillo,\r\nturning to that gentleman. \"I don't think it amounts to anything. I vote\r\nwith you against my better judgment. I do not believe that this\r\namendment will give The People what they want - an opportunity to vote\r\ndirectly for candidates for the United States Senate. My opinion is that\r\nwe should pass a good bill or no bill at all. I shall, however, yield to\r\nSenator Wright, who is the recognized leader in this Direct Primary\r\nfight, and vote for his amendment.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then the six machine members rejected the amendment.\r\n\r\nThere wasn't much left of the Direct Primary bill. The measure was, on\r\nFebruary 16th, two weeks after the application of the committee's\r\npruning knife, reported back to the Senate with all reference to\r\nelection of United States Senators stricken from it, and the\r\nunconstitutional and impracticable majority vote required for the\r\nnomination of candidates for office, instead of the constitutional and\r\npractical plurality vote, as originally provided in the bill.\r\n\r\nThe fact should not be lost sight of that the two Senators on the\r\nCommittee on Election Laws who led the fight against the Direct Primary\r\nbill, Leavitt and Wolfe, in the Committee on Public Morals led the fight\r\nagainst the Anti-Gambling bill. Nor should it be forgotten that two of\r\ntheir most docile followers in the Committee on Election Laws, Kennedy\r\nand Hare, are \"Democrats.\" There was no partisanship shown in the ranks\r\nof the opponents of the Direct Primary bill; machine Democrats and\r\nmachine Republicans united for its defeat. But when anti-machine\r\nRepublican and anti-machine Democrats united for its passage, Wolfe and\r\nLeavitt were shocked beyond measure.\r\n\r\nMachine Senators denounced the anti-machine Republicans as mongrels,\r\nenemies of the Republican party, and insisted that if the anti-machine\r\nRepublicans persisted in continuing with the anti-machine Democrats to\r\nsecure the passage of an effective Direct Primary law, the Republican\r\nparty in California would go to smash.\r\n\r\nThe arrogant course of the machine members of the Election Laws\r\nCommittee, had at least one good effect it drove the anti-machine\r\nRepublicans and the anti machine Democrats together as a matter of\r\nself-defense. The anti-machine Republicans and Democrats saw the machine\r\nDemocrats and Republicans united to defeat the passage of an effective\r\nDirect Primary measure. So the anti-machine Republicans and Democrats\r\norganized that they might successfully combat the organized machine\r\nDemocrats and Republicans. For the first time in the history of the\r\nCalifornia Legislature, so far as the writer knows, the Senate divided\r\non the only practical line of division for the enactment of good\r\nmeasures and the defeat of bad ones - with the anti-machine Senators on\r\none side and the machine Senators on the other.\r\n\r\nThe \"band-wagon\" Senators of the Welch variety, and the doubtful\r\nSenators, were left for the moment to herd by themselves.\r\n\r\nThe anti-machine forces held meetings - caucuses if you like - to decide\r\nupon the course to be pursued. They numbered at first twenty members,\r\nfifteen Republicans and five Democrats. The Republicans were Bell,\r\nBirdsall, Black, Boynton, Burnett, Cutten, Estudillo, Hurd, Price,\r\nRoseberry, Stetson, Strobridge, Thompson, Walker and Wright; the\r\nDemocrats, Caminetti, Campbell, Cartwright, Miller and Holohan. George\r\nVan Smith, of the San Francisco Call, credited with being an expert on\r\nDirect Primary legislation, was admitted to the deliberations of the\r\ntwenty.\r\n\r\nSenator Price, however, became alarmed at the irregularity of\r\nanti-machine Republicans meeting with anti machine Democrats, gathered\r\nhis virtuous partisan skirts about him and fled in dismay.\r\n\r\nSenator Caminetti also left the meeting. Caminetti is a strong advocate\r\nof the Oregon plan for the election of United States Senators. When\r\nCaminetti found Senator Wright, the accepted leader of the pro-primary\r\nforces, opposed not only to the Oregon plan, but to any plan that would\r\ngive electors a State-wide vote for United States Senators, he refused\r\nto go to Wright's assistance. Later on, however, when Wright went to\r\nCaminetti pleading for support, Caminetti agreed to abide by the\r\ndecisions of the anti-machine caucus. Curiously enough, after the\r\nmachine had worn the anti-machine forces out, Caminetti was the only\r\nSenator who refused to accept the machine's amendments to the bill which\r\nthe anti-machine caucus had agreed upon.\r\n\r\nWith Price and Caminetti out, the anti-machine forces were reduced to\r\neighteen Senators, although it was known that Rush sympathized with the\r\nmovement but was not present because he had been unavoidably detained.\r\n\r\nThe eighteen organized by electing Senator Estudillo chairman, and\r\nSenator Boynton secretary. Senator Wright made a short address in which\r\nhe virtually threw up his hands. He told what the Wolfe-Leavitt element\r\nhad done with the bill in committee, and stated that unless the\r\nanti-machine forces got together, the machine would amend the measure\r\ninto ineffectiveness. Following Wright's address the anti-machine\r\nSenators considered the original Wright-Stanton bill under three heads:\r\n\r\n(1) Shall a mere plurality, or a majority, or a high plurality be\r\nrequired to nominate at a primary election?\r\n\r\n(2) Shall the partisan features be eliminated from the measure?\r\n\r\n(3) Shall the provisions of the measure be extended to the election of\r\nUnited States Senators?\r\n\r\nThe first question was brought up on Stetson's motion that a twenty-five\r\nper cent plurality be required to nominate. The machine aimed to fix the\r\nplurality at forty per cent, but even the twenty-five per cent\r\ncompromise was denied. The motion received but four votes, in its favor.\r\n\r\nThen came discussion of the clause quoted in the previous chapter, which\r\nrequires of each primary candidate that he make affidavit that he\r\nsupported his party ticket at the previous election, and proposes to\r\nsupport it at the coming election. It was understood by all who had any\r\nthing to do with the Direct Primary bill that the clause made it\r\nimpossible for a primary candidate to run on two primary tickets.\r\nCartwright moved that the clause be stricken from the bill. The motion\r\nwas lost by a vote of 14 to 4. Senators like Black of Santa Clara voted\r\nagainst the motion in the interest of harmony, although personally they\r\nfavored the elimination of all partisan features.\r\n\r\nThe question of primary nomination of candidates for the United States\r\nSenate was then taken up. Senator Wright moved that the vote for\r\nSenators be advisory only, and that it be by Assembly and Senatorial\r\ndistricts instead of State-wide, as the original bill provided. The vote\r\nwas as follows:\r\n\r\nFor Wright's motion - Burnett, Wright - 2.\r\n\r\nAgainst Wright's motion - Bell, Birdsall, Black, Boynton, Cartwright,\r\nCutten, Holohan, Miller, Roseberry, Stetson, Strobridge, Walker - 12.\r\n\r\nExcused from voting - Campbell, Estudillo, Hurd, Thompson.\r\n\r\nA scene of great confusion followed. Campbell, who had refused to vote\r\nbecause he insisted upon the Oregon plan of electing United States\r\nSenators by direct vote of The People, insisted that the provision be\r\nincorporated into the bill. He refused to be bound by any plan that\r\nwould restrict the election within party lines. So they blocked Campbell\r\nin one corner of the room with a table, and reasoned with him.\r\nTwenty-one votes were required to pass the Direct Primary bill in the\r\nSenate. At that time counting Rush, who was not present at the caucus,\r\nthe anti-machine forces had only nineteen. They could not afford to lose\r\neven one of their number.\r\n\r\nAbove the confusion, Senator Holohan managed to make his voice heard.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"I would like to have the Oregon plan incorporated\r\ninto this bill, But that seems to be impracticable at this time.\r\nEventually, I am sure California will adopt the Oregon plan of naming\r\nthe United States Senator, which to my way of thinking is the most\r\ncommon sense, the fairest, the most American plan. But if we are to pass\r\na Direct Primary measure at the present session, we must reach a basis\r\nof compromise. Let us now get together and stand together on a measure\r\nupon which we can all agree. Let us pledge ourselves to abide by the\r\ndecision of this meeting, and stand or fall by the bill which we have\r\nagreed upon.\"\r\n\r\nHolohan's counsel prevailed. The Senators present pledged themselves to\r\nabide by the decision of the meeting and to stand or fall by the bill\r\nwhich they had agreed upon. And Senator Leroy A. Wright was among them\r\nand was bound in honor as every Senator present was bound in honor to\r\nstand by the bill which had been agreed upon.\r\n\r\nThe uniting of the anti-machine Senators to fight the combined machine\r\nDemocrats and Republicans called down upon the anti-machine element the\r\ndenunciation of the machine press. The Catkins newspapers, for example,\r\nsputtered their condemnation of Republican Senators who would unite with\r\nDemocratic Senators in \"rump caucus.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand the San Francisco Call, at that time warmly supporting\r\nthe anti-machine movement in the Senate, was extreme in denouncing\r\nLieutenant-Governor Porter, presiding officer of the Senate, Leavitt,\r\nWolfe, and all others who were opposing the passage of the Direct\r\nPrimary measure as it had originally been introduced by Wright, and as\r\nit had been agreed upon in the reform caucus[38].\r\n\r\nThe fight in the Senate came on the second reading of the bill February\r\n18th. On the 16th, however, the setting for the contest had been fixed\r\nby the majority of the Committee on Election Laws, which reported with\r\nfavorable recommendation the measure as the Committee had cut it to\r\npieces. The minority of the Committee, Estudillo, Stetson and Wright,\r\nreported back the bill agreed upon by the non-partisan caucus of\r\nanti-machine Senators.\r\n\r\nBut the fight did not come over either report. When the bill came up on\r\nthe 18th for second reading and amendment, Senator McCartney, on behalf\r\nof the machine forces, introduced a resolution over which the contest\r\nwaged. McCartney's resolution provided that the bill should be so\r\namended that the primary vote for United States Senator should be by\r\ndistricts and advisory only, and that for county and local offices a\r\nvote of 25 per cent and for State offices a vote of 40 per cent should\r\nnominate[39].\r\n\r\nThe debate was over this resolution. The motion for its adoption was\r\ndefeated by a vote of twenty-seven against to thirteen for[40].\r\n\r\nIncidentally, the debate settled one of the most important questions\r\naffecting the bill, namely, the percentage of votes to be required for\r\nprimary nominations. The machine, to render the measure inoperative, was\r\ncontending for a majority or at least a high plurality vote, while the\r\nanti-machine element was contending for a mere plurality. The debate\r\ndeveloped the fact, that any provision for other than a mere plurality\r\nvote would be unconstitutional. This service was performed by Senator\r\nCutten of Humboldt[41]. Senator Cutten's clear presentation of this much\r\ndiscussed point, settled the vote percentage question right there. When\r\nthe measure was under consideration by the Assembly Election Laws\r\nCommittee, Grove L. Johnson did suggest that a 40 per cent plurality be\r\nrequired to nominate. But no serious attempt was made so to amend the\r\nbill, after Cutten's speech, and the defeat of the McCartney amendment.\r\n\r\nNaturally, the anti-machine forces felt warmly encouraged by this\r\ncomplete defeat of the machine. The San Francisco Call, the recognized\r\nadvocate of the Direct Primary bill, the next day, February 19th, said\r\nof the outcome:\r\n\r\n      \"Twenty-seven Senators at Sacramento stood true to their party\r\n      pledges, and voiced the will of the people in their votes on the\r\n      Direct Primary bill yesterday. Thirteen other Senators wrote into\r\n      the record conclusive proof of their unfitness for the offices they\r\n      hold, when they voted against the Wright-Stanton bill, and for the\r\n      corrupt political machine which is the Southern Pacific Railroad.\r\n      Every man of these thirteen confessed corruptionists knew what he\r\n      was doing, knew whose will he was putting above The People's. Every\r\n      one of these thirteen betrayers of the public weal has written the\r\n      epitaph of his political tombstone.\"\r\n\r\nThe Call was as generous in its praise of the anti-machine Democrats and\r\nRepublicans as it was bitter against the machine Senators who had\r\nendeavored to force the McCartney amendment into the bill. While that\r\npaper printed the names of the thirteen in bold, black type on the first\r\npage under the heading, \"These Men Voted for the Machine,\" in type just\r\nas bold and just as black it printed in an honor column the names of the\r\ntwenty-seven who had voted against the McCartney amendment, under the\r\nheading, \"These Men Voted for the People.\"\r\n\r\nSaid the Call in its admirable report of the defeat of the McCartney\r\namendment, of the original nineteen anti-machine Senators who had\r\norganized to resist the machine:\r\n\r\n      \"Genuine manhood has been on tap at every conference of the\r\n      independents. They have not squabbled for partisan advantage. They\r\n      have worked together to give The People an honest and genuine\r\n      Direct Primary measure. Senator Wright won a brilliant fight. He\r\n      won it with and through the earnest co-operation of the unbossed\r\n      Democrats and Republicans.\"\r\n\r\nSaid the Call of the measure itself in its issue of February 18th - the\r\nday of the defeat of the machine Senators:\r\n\r\n      \"The Direct Primary bill is The People's bill. Such men as Dooling,\r\n      Wright, Stanton, Davis and Cartwright made it. There is no honest\r\n      argument against it, there will be no honest Senators against it.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the view of the Call on February 18. Few were willing to\r\nbelieve on that date that within a month the Call would have thrown its\r\ninfluence on the side of Leavitt and Wolfe and Warren Porter in an\r\nattempt to force part of the McCartney amendment into the Direct Primary\r\nbill. It did not seem possible then that within a month the Call would\r\nbe denouncing, ridiculing and misrepresenting Senators whose efforts had\r\nresulted in the defeat of the McCartney amendment because of the refusal\r\nof these anti-machine Senators to join with the machine Senators whom\r\nthey had once defeated, and accept the amendment which they had once\r\nrejected. It did not then seem possible that on March 18th the Call\r\nwould be behind the thirteen \"betrayers of the public weal,\" itself\r\nbetraying the Senators whose \"genuine manhood\" had on February 18\r\nappealed to its editors so strongly.\r\n\r\nBut such was to be. And, too, the combination of Calkins Syndicate,\r\nLieutenant-Governor Porter, Senator Leroy A. Wright, the San Francisco\r\nCall and the thirteen \"betrayers of the public weal\" proved too much for\r\nthe little band of anti-machine Senators. And what is more, backed by\r\nthe Call, the machine leaders finally amended the Direct Primary bill,\r\nwhich on February 18th the Call had stated very positively no honest\r\nSenator would be against.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[37] Wright's amendment had been carefully typewritten before the\r\nmeeting. It read as follows,\r\n\r\n\"Party candidates for the office of United States Senator shall have\r\ntheir name placed on the official primary election ballots of their\r\nrespective parties in the manner herein provided for State Office,\r\nprovided, however, that the vote for candidate for United States Senator\r\nshall be an advisory vote for the purpose of ascertaining the sentiment\r\nof the voters in their respective parties.\"\r\n\r\n[38] On February 17th the Call said of Senator Eddie Wolfe's opposition\r\nto the bill:\r\n\r\n\"The fight (Direct Primary) promises to be both spirited and bitter.\r\nEddie Wolfe of San Francisco, picked by the machine to make its fight\r\nfor the garroting of the Direct Primary bill, by the injection of a\r\nmajority nominating clause, has served notice that he proposes to tear\r\nthe reformers to pieces.\"\r\n\r\nOf Leavitt and other machine Senators, the Call on the same date said:\r\n\r\n\"Leavitt, who bossed the fight against the Otis-Walker bill, will\r\nfurnish the brains for the fight against the Direct Primary bill, and\r\nevery one of the seven who voted against the Otis-Walker bill, are more\r\nor less frankly against the primary bill. Savage, who did not vote\r\nagainst the Walker-Otis bill because his vote would have done no good,\r\nand Hartman and Hare, who did vote against the Otis-Walker bill, have\r\ngone on record against honest direct Primaries, as members of the\r\nmajority of the Senate Committee on Election Laws. Savage is frank\r\nenough to admit that he is opposed to any direct primary law.\"\r\n\r\n[39] The McCartney resolution was in full-as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That Senate Bill No. 3, and all pending amendments thereto,\r\nbe and the same is hereby referred to the Committee on Elections and\r\nElection Laws, with the following instructions:\r\n\r\n\"1. Amend the bill so as to give an advisory vote by districts on United\r\nStates Senators.\"\r\n\r\n\"2. Amend the bill by providing for a percentage of votes before\r\nnomination by direct vote of the people, as follows: If the highest\r\ncandidate for any county or local office receive less than 25 per cent\r\nof the vote of his party, and if the highest candidate for a State\r\noffice receive less than 40 per cent of the vote of his party, that the\r\nnomination shall be referred to a convention of delegates elected at the\r\nsame time that candidates are voted on by direct vote.\"\r\n\r\n\"3. Amend the bill by providing that the convention aforesaid shall\r\nprepare the platform of the party and perfect party organization.\"\r\n\r\n[40] The vote in full was as follows:\r\n\r\nAgainst the McCartney amendment and in effect for the bill agreed upon\r\nby the anti-machine Senators: Anthony, Bell, Birdsall, Black, Boynton,\r\nBurnett, Caminetti, Campbell, Cartwright, Curtin, Cutten, Estudillo,\r\nHolohan, Hurd, Lewis, Martinelli, Miller, Price, Roseberry, Rush,\r\nSanford, Stetson, Strobridge, Thompson, Walker, Welch, Wright - 27.\r\n\r\nFor the McCartney amendment and in effect against the bill agreed upon\r\nby the anti-machine Senators: Bates, Bills, Finn, Hare, Hartman,\r\nKennedy, Leavitt, McCartney, Reily, Savage, Weed, Willis, Wolfe - 13.\r\n\r\n[41] Cutten showed that Section 13, Article XX of the State Constitution\r\nprovides that \"a plurality of the votes given at any election shall\r\nconstitute a choice where not otherwise directed in this Constitution.\"\r\n\r\nSenator Cutten then proceeded to demonstrate that a primary election is\r\nan election within the meaning of the terms used. The Supreme Court of\r\nIndiana has so declared, and, coming nearer home, Cutten showed that the\r\nCalifornia Supreme Court has so held also.\r\n\r\nIn The People vs. Cavanaugh, 112 California, the Supreme Court held that\r\nany primary election that should become mandatory becomes an election\r\nand only those primaries that may be optional with a party as to whether\r\nor not they should be held, are not elections.\r\n\r\nThe Wright-Stanton bill and the Direct Primary amendment to the\r\nConstitution make the direct primaries mandatory, nor is there anything\r\nin the State Constitution providing that anything other than a plurality\r\nvote shall be required to nominate. For the Legislature to have yielded\r\nto the machine's demand that a majority or high plurality vote be\r\nrequired to nominate and inserted such a provision in the Direct Primary\r\nbill, would have been to render that measure unconstitutional, for under\r\nthe plain provisions of the Constitution only a plurality vote can be\r\nrequired to nominate.\r\n\r\nWere a majority or even high percentage plurality vote required to\r\nnominate, the Direct Primary law would have been made unconstitutional,\r\nbecause:\r\n\r\n1. A plurality might not be equal to the percentage or majority.\r\n\r\n2. A percentage or majority contemplates a convention to nominate in\r\ncase the candidate does not receive the percentage or majority, and a\r\nconvention, the best authorities hold, is prohibited under the\r\nconstitutional amendment providing for the primary election.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter X.\r\n\r\nFight Over Assembly Amendments.\r\n\r\nMachine Succeeds in Amending the Direct Primary Bill in the Assembly -\r\nAssemblyman Pulcifer at Critical Moment Votes with the Machine - Senate,\r\nAlthough Held Up By Machine Element for a Week, Refuses to Concur in\r\nAssembly's Action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe machine Senators, having failed to amend the Direct Primary bill on\r\nits second reading, apparently accepted their whipping, and allowed the\r\nmeasure to go through third reading and final passage without\r\nopposition[42].\r\n\r\nTwenty-seven Senators at the final roll call voted for it; not one vote\r\nwas cast against it. Even Leavitt and Wolfe voted for it. The\r\nanti-machine Senators had won \"a glorious victory.\"\r\n\r\nBut the victory was one tempered with grave misgivings on the part of\r\ncareful observers of machine trickery. The fact that the bill as it had\r\npassed the Senate contained several serious clerical and typographical\r\nerrors, and that its title was unsatisfactory if not defective, worried\r\nthe genuine supporters of the bill not a little. The bill had been\r\nloosely drawn to begin with, and as originally introduced contained most\r\nunfortunate clerical errors, which bobbed up at most inopportune times.\r\n\r\nAt every stage of its passage in the Senate such errors were uncovered,\r\nand after it had passed second reading, no less than eight serious\r\nerrors were discovered to be still in the bill. The only way these\r\nerrors could be corrected was by amendment.\r\n\r\nThe errors were called to the attention of Senator Wright and of George\r\nVan Smith of the Call, who were urged to have them corrected in the\r\nSenate that the bill might go to the Assembly letter perfect, and\r\nwithout necessity of amendment[43]. But both Van Smith and Wright were\r\nof the opinion that time would be gained by leaving the Assembly to make\r\nthe corrections.\r\n\r\nThe bill as it finally passed the Senate was a defective bill, the\r\ndefects of which could be corrected in the Assembly only by amendment.\r\nIn the end the fate of the measure was made to hinge on these clerical\r\nand typographical defects.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly Committee on Election Laws had been stacked against the\r\npassage of a Direct Primary bill, precisely as the Senate Committee had\r\nbeen. At the first meeting held by the Committee to consider the\r\nmeasure, it became evident that the majority of the Committee would, if\r\nit could, put the McCartney amendments, which had been defeated in the\r\nSenate, into the bill.\r\n\r\nLeeds, Chairman of the Committee, moved that the primary vote for United\r\nStates Senator be made advisory and by districts only, while Grove L.\r\nJohnson, in spite of the fact that such a provision is impracticable and\r\nunconstitutional, stated that he wished a provision in the bill\r\nrequiring a 40 per cent plurality to nominate, instead of a mere\r\nplurality.\r\n\r\nLeeds and Johnson, taken together, stood for precisely what the machine\r\nhad stood for in the Senate, namely, an advisory, district vote for\r\nUnited States Senators and a 40 per cent plurality vote to nominate.\r\n\r\nSpeaker Stanton, although not a member of the Committee, was present at\r\nthe meeting, and although he had introduced the bill in the Assembly,\r\nannounced that he was for so amending the measure that the vote for\r\nUnited States Senator should be made merely advisory and by districts.\r\nThis was pretty strong intimation that there was trouble ahead for the\r\nDirect Primary bill. Stanton was in effect throwing down his own bill.\r\n\r\nAfter several meetings, the Committee adopted amendments providing for\r\nthe Leeds - suggested advisory district vote for United States Senators,\r\nproviding for correction of the clerical and typographical errors, and\r\nproviding an oath from primary candidates that they would abide by the\r\nplatform of their party to be adopted after their nomination. This last\r\namendment was defeated in the Assembly.\r\n\r\nThe only real opposition in the Committee to the machine's plan to make\r\nthe primary vote for United States Senators advisory only and by\r\ndistrict, came from Assemblymen Hinkle of San Diego and Drew of Fresno.\r\nDrew was ill most of the time and could not attend the meetings. The\r\nbrunt of the fight for a State-wide vote for United States Senators,\r\ntherefore, fell on Hinkle.\r\n\r\nHe fought well.\r\n\r\nEvery effort was made to pull him down. He was told that his bills would\r\nbe \"killed.\"\r\n\r\nHe was deliberately misrepresented in papers which were endeavoring to\r\nforce into the bill the advisory district vote amendment, which, as\r\nintroduced in the Senate by McCartney, had been rejected by the\r\nanti-machine Senators. Leavitt and Wolfe and Warren Porter were for the\r\namendment, but the anti-machine Senators continued against it as they\r\nhad on February 18th, the day of their \"glorious victory\" over the\r\nmachine in the Direct Primary fight.\r\n\r\nBut, astonishing as it may seem, the San Francisco Call[44], which up to\r\nthe passage of the bill in the Senate had fought the machine Senators so\r\nvaliantly, was giving indication of siding with Wolfe and Leavitt. In\r\nits issue of March 6th, the Call stated that Hinkle was alone of the\r\nAssembly Committee battling for the bill as it passed the Senate. In\r\nanother sentence the Call said: \"Leeds, Rech, Hinkle and Pugh voted for\r\nthe advisory vote amendments.\"\r\n\r\nThat sentence was shown about the Capitol, and on it was based the story\r\nthat Hinkle had \"fallen down,\" and would vote with the machine. All this\r\nadded to the confusion of the situation.\r\n\r\nBut Hinkle had not \"fallen down.\" He was in the fight just as hard as\r\never, and with Assemblyman Bohnett organized the reform element in the\r\nAssembly to fight the machine amendments.\r\n\r\nThose who were endeavoring to force the advisory district plan for\r\nnomination of Senators into the bill took the most astonishing methods\r\nto force it upon the anti-machine Senators. For example, the San\r\nFrancisco Call of March 4th said of it:\r\n\r\n\t\"The amendments proposed by Leeds and supported by Stanton are not even\r\nremotely related to the McCartney proposition, which was voted down in\r\nthe Senate.\"\r\n\r\nThe Call's statement was easily disproved, but it unquestionably\r\nconfused the anti-machine legislators, who were insisting upon retaining\r\nthe provision for State-wide vote for Senators in the bill[45].\r\n\r\nAnd then came the cry that those who were opposing the Leeds-McCartney\r\namendment were enemies of the Direct Primary, for the Assembly, it was\r\nalleged, was overwhelmingly in favor of the amendment, and would not\r\npass the bill without it. Jere Burke, John C. Lynch, and other patriots\r\nof their ilk were most insistent in expression of this fear. But such\r\nmen as Bohnett, Hinkle, Drew and other recognized anti-machine leaders\r\nin the Assembly were not to be bluffed in this way. They stood firmly\r\nfor the passage of the bill as it had passed the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe fight on the floor of the Assembly came over Leeds' motion to amend\r\nthe bill by making the vote for United States Senator advisory only and\r\nby districts. The vote on Leeds' motion was 37 to 37. The \"overwhelming\r\nmajority\" favoring the amendment, in spite of the use of every pull at\r\nthe command of the machine, had not materialized. As a majority vote was\r\nnecessary to read the amendment into the bill, a moment more and Speaker\r\nStanton would have been forced to declare the amendment lost. This would\r\nhave meant final defeat for the machine, and the Direct Primary bill as\r\nit had passed the Senate would have gone to final passage.\r\n\r\nAt this critical moment in the bill's history, however, Assemblyman\r\nPulcifer[46], the Lincoln-Roosevelt League member from Alameda county,\r\ngot into action. He had voted against the amendment. But with his vote\r\nreally meaning defeat for the machine element, he promptly changed his\r\nvote from no to aye. This made the vote 38 for the amendment and 36\r\nagainst it. The amendment which the anti-machine Senators had fought so\r\nvaliantly and so effectively was finally read into the bill[47].\r\n\r\nThe amendments necessary to correct the typographical and clerical\r\nerrors which had been permitted to remain in the bill as it passed the\r\nSenate, together with a number of ridiculous amendments - which were\r\nfinally rejected by both Houses - were then adopted, and the bill sent\r\nto the Senate[48].\r\n\r\nThe fact developed almost immediately that if the Senate refused to\r\nconcur in the Assembly amendment forcing the advisory district vote into\r\nthe bill the Assembly would recede from the amendment. As a matter of\r\nfact Assemblyman Collum, who voted for the amendment March 9th, voted on\r\nMarch 22d to recede from it. Had the anti-machine forces in the Assembly\r\nbeen held together, as they could have been had the question of receding\r\nbeen put up to them fairly, few other changes with Collum's would have\r\nbeen sufficient to assure success for the anti-machine forces.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of the situation in the Assembly, Senator Wright, who was\r\nby this time working openly with Wolfe, Leavitt and Warren Porter to\r\nsecure the adoption of the Leeds amendment (which as the McCartney\r\namendment the Senate had already rejected), was insisting that the\r\nAssembly would not recede, and that unless the Senate concurred with the\r\nAssembly amendment, nothing could save the Direct Primary bill from\r\nbeing cut to pieces in Free Conference Committee.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the Senate by a vote of 19 against to 20 for concurrence,\r\ndid refuse to concur, 21 votes being necessary for concurrence.\r\n\r\nSenator Stetson was absent when the vote was taken, being ill at his\r\nhome in Alameda county. Had he been present he would have voted against\r\nconcurrence in the amendments. This would have made the vote 20 to 20.\r\n\r\nOriginally, on February 18th, twenty-seven Senators had voted against\r\nthe Leeds-McCartney amendment, but when Senator Wright switched to the\r\nmachine, Senators Hurd and Burnett wobbled along after him. The four\r\nband-wagon Senators, Lewis, Martinelli, Price and Welch, tagged along\r\nafter them. This made the vote:\r\n\r\nAgainst concurrence in the amendment and for the bill as it passed the\r\nSenate - Anthony, Bell, Birdsall, Black, Boynton, Caminetti, Campbell,\r\nCartwright, Curtin, Cutten, Estudillo, Holohan, Miller, Roseberry, Rush,\r\nSanford, Strobridge, Thompson, Walker - 19.\r\n\r\nFor concurrence in the amendment and against the bill as it originally\r\npassed the Senate - Bates, Bills, Burnett, Finn, Hare, Hartman, Hurd,\r\nKennedy, Leavitt, Lewis, Martinelli, McCartney, Price, Reily, Savage,\r\nWeed, Welch, Willis, Wolfe, Wright - 20.\r\n\r\nEvery one of the thirteen Senators who opposed the bill when it was\r\nfirst before the Senate, voted to concur. Wright, Welch, Price,\r\nMartinelli, Lewis, Burnett and Hurd joining them, made their number\r\ntwenty.\r\n\r\nUnder the rules which govern the Senate, in the event of a tie vote, all\r\nthe Senators voting, the President of the Senate, in this case Warren\r\nPorter, has the casting vote.\r\n\r\nHad Senator Stetson been present, he would have voted with the\r\nanti-machine Senators. This would have made the vote 20 to 20. Warren\r\nPorter would then have had the deciding vote. He would have voted to\r\nconcur. Senator Stetson's illness temporarily saved the Direct Primary\r\nbill.\r\n\r\nIn the ordinary course of legislative business, the Senate having\r\nrefused to concur in the Assembly amendment, the bill would have gone\r\nback to the Assembly, the Assembly would have receded from the\r\namendment, and the machine's defeat would have been final. But the\r\nquick-witted Wolfe saw a way to prevent such action. He promptly moved\r\nthat the Senate reconsider the vote by which it had refused to concur in\r\nthe Assembly amendment. Wolfe commanded twenty votes of the Senators\r\npresent, the anti-machine element nineteen. Wolfe required, however,\r\ntwenty-one to compel reconsideration. But when the question came up,\r\nWolfe still lacked the one vote necessary for reconsideration, the\r\nanti-machine element was still without the necessary twenty votes to tie\r\nthe Senate, thus giving Warren Porter the deciding vote. Wolfe, however,\r\nwith his twenty votes, postponed consideration of his motion to\r\nreconsider the vote by which the Senate had refused to concur. A\r\nsomewhat extraordinary parliamentary situation, to say the least. But it\r\nanswered the machine's purpose. For a week[49a] the machine was able to\r\nhold the Senate in deadlock. All business was practically suspended. For\r\nhours the reform Senators were compelled to sit in their seats waiting\r\nthe pleasure of President Porter and President Pro Tem. Wolfe to call\r\nthe Senate to order. The folly of permitting the machine to organize the\r\nSenate was forced home to every good-government man present. The machine\r\nbecause it controlled the Senate organization could and did arrogantly\r\noverride the rights of the Senate, giving the ultimatum that no business\r\nshould be transacted until the anti-machine Senators had concurred in\r\nthe machine amendments to the Direct Primary bill.\r\n\r\nThe machine's play was to bully, bluff or beg one of the anti-machine\r\nSenators to desert to the machine, which would have given the machine\r\ntwenty-one votes, enough for concurrence, or, failing in this, to force\r\nthe attendance of Senator Stetson, which would have tied the Senate,\r\nthus giving Warren Porter the deciding vote. But before Senator Stetson,\r\npale and plainly on the verge of breakdown, could be brought to\r\nSacramento, Senator Black became very ill and was obliged to go to his\r\nhome at Palo Alto. Thus when Stetson returned, the vote stood 20 to 19,\r\nprecisely where it had been before. Performer Porter was still denied\r\nthe privilege of casting the deciding vote. For once the machine found\r\nitself squarely against a stone wall, with the sympathy of the public\r\nstrongly against its creatures and methods. Night after night as the\r\nfight went on, the Senate gallery was packed with interested spectators,\r\nwho cheered the anti-machine Senators to the echo. There were no cheers\r\nfor the machine, but on one occasion at least the machine was hissed,\r\nwhen one of its creatures attempted an attack on Senator Black.\r\n\r\nNever did the machine work harder to switch anti-machine Senators to its\r\nside. Jere Burke had characteristic corner conferences, Johnny Lynch\r\nlabored with anti-machine Senators openly on the floor of the Senate\r\nchamber, as did Warren Porter. From a southern county came the Chairman\r\nof the Republican County Committee to tell his Senator who was voting\r\nwith the anti-machine element what a mistake he was making. P. H.\r\nMcCarthy \"happened in\" and worked with George Van Smith of the Call and\r\nEddie Wolfe in the fruitless attempt made to \"pull down\" Senator\r\nAnthony[49]. Anti-machine Senators found their pet bills being held up\r\nin Assembly Committees.\r\n\r\nBut the nineteen anti-machine members stood firm, in spite of the fact\r\nthat Senator Wright, who had originally led them, and George Van Smith,\r\nof the Call, who had originally advised them, and the Call, which had\r\noriginally backed them, were all working on the side of Leavitt and\r\nWolfe and Porter and the thirteen Senators of whom the Call had said on\r\nFebruary 19, when they had voted for the amendment which they were still\r\nsupporting, \"Every man of these thirteen confessed corruptionists knew\r\nwhat he was doing - knew whose will he was putting above The People's\r\nwill. Every one of these thirteen betrayers of the public weal has\r\nwritten the epitaph of his political tombstone.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then the machine forces attacked Senator Black. Although Senator\r\nBlack was lying ill at his home at Palo Alto, the Call on March 18\r\nstated that he was in hiding in Sacramento.\r\n\r\nThe Call on the same date expressed its deep regret for and its utter\r\ncondemnation of, the \"asinine filibuster, designed to prevent a tie vote\r\nwhich would be decided by the Lieutenant-Governor, Warren Porter, in\r\nfavor of concurrence in the Assembly amendment to the Direct Primary\r\nbill.\"\r\n\r\nOn February 18 the Call had objected very strenuously to Porter's\r\nattitude toward the Direct Primary bill. The Call on that date said:\r\n\r\n      \"To-day the wolves (a pet name for the machine Senators), urged by\r\n      their masters, will make their last stand in the Senate against a\r\n      people determined to be free. Warren Porter, the Lieutenant-Governor\r\n      of the fatted soul, who professes all the virtues and practices all\r\n      political evil, will be the whipper-in.\"\r\n\r\nOne month later, March 18, the Call was complaining bitterly that the\r\nanti-machine Senators would not permit the same \"Lieutenant-Governor of\r\nthe fatted soul\" to whip them into line for the amendment to the Direct\r\nPrimary bill, which they had rejected on February 18, and for which the\r\nCall had praised them generously. The Call's special representative at\r\nSacramento, George Nan Smith, was by this time working openly with\r\nPorter, Wolfe, Leavitt, Hartman, Lynch and Burke to compel Senate\r\nconcurrence in the Assembly amendments, while Senators Boynton, Black,\r\nMiller, Campbell, Holohan, Stetson and the other anti-machine Senators\r\nwhom the Call had formerly backed in their efforts against the machine,\r\nhad become \"pin-head politicians,\" in the columns of the Call, intent\r\nupon defeat of the Direct Primary bill.\r\n\r\nThe Call's extraordinary change and outrageous condemnation of the\r\nanti-machine Senators of course brought its protest. The people of Palo\r\nAlto met in mass meeting on March 21st, and adopted resolutions\r\ncondemning the Call's course[50]. Senator Black from his sick bed wrote\r\na letter showing the Call's insincerity and breach of faith with the\r\npro-primary Senators[51]. The paper was bitterly denounced on the floor\r\nof the Senate.\r\n\r\nBut throughout the State the newspapers which stand for good government,\r\nand incidentally for an effective direct primary law, were firm in their\r\nsupport of the anti-machine Senators. Just before Senator Black was\r\ntaken ill, for example, at the time when Senator Stetson was unable to\r\nbe at the capital, the Sacramento Star, in an editorial article under\r\nthe heading, \"Illness a Blessing,\" cleverly put in a nutshell what the\r\npeople were thinking and the reform press was saying. \"We do not desire\r\nto wish Senator Stetson any bad luck,\" said The Star, \"but if his slight\r\nindisposition should continue for a few days, or, in lieu of that, if\r\nsome other solon of the same faith as regards the Primary bill can only\r\ncontract some minor ailment, there will be more joy than sorrow among\r\nthe people who want something approaching a real direct primary.\"[52]\r\n\r\nMatters were brought to a climax when the performers through Senator\r\nWeed - who was, by the way, Chairman of the Committee on Public Morals,\r\nwhich reported adversely on the Walker-Otis bill-introduced a\r\nresolution, authorizing the Sergeant-at-Arms to bring Senator Black to\r\nSacramento, even though a special engine and coach be chartered for the\r\npurpose[53]. The resolution brought forth indignant protest from the\r\nanti-machine Senators, and a telegram from Senator Black to Warren\r\nPorter, denouncing the unwarranted proceedings[54]. Nevertheless, Doctor\r\nDouglass W. Montgomery of San Francisco, in spite of the fact that four\r\nreputable physicians, Dr. Howard Black, Dr. H. B. Reynolds, Dr. J. C.\r\nSpencer and Dr. R. L. Wilbur, had certified that Senator black's\r\nphysical condition did not permit of his being removed to Sacramento,\r\nwent to Palo Alto with the Sergeant-at-Arms to investigate the sick\r\nSenator. Montgomery's investigations seem to have been confined to the\r\noutside of Senator Black's house[55]. At any rate he did not see Senator\r\nBlack. The performance was given its sordid feature by Montgomery\r\ncharging the Senate $400 for his services.\r\n\r\nThe Montgomery incident demonstrated clearly that the machine was\r\nwhipped[56]. Senator Wolfe accordingly on Monday, March 22, after\r\nholding the Senate in deadlock more than a week, moved that the vote\r\nwhereby the Senate had refused to concur in the Assembly amendment to\r\nthe Direct Primary bill, be reconsidered. This, the Senate as a matter\r\nof courtesy, at Senator Wolfe's request, did. It then refused to concur\r\nin the Assembly's objectionable amendment. For the second time, the\r\nSenate went on record against the machine's advisory district-vote plan\r\nfor the election of United States Senators. For the second time the\r\nanti-machine element in the Senate, in its efforts to secure the passage\r\nof an effective direct primary measure, had, fighting fair, and in the\r\nopen, and above board always, defeated the machine. The machine\r\nthereupon met the anti-machine element with a trick that completely\r\nturned the tables, a trick by which the anti-machine forces were\r\ndefeated, and the machine element placed in a position to amend the bill\r\nas it might see fit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[42] Senator Wolfe, on the day of his defeat in the Senate, told the\r\nwriter that he would offer no further opposition to the passage of the\r\nbill.\r\n\r\n[43] Charles R. Detrick of Palo Alto, for example, called the attention\r\nof both Wright and Van Smith to the errors, and offered his services for\r\ntheir correction, but his offer was declined.\r\n\r\n[44] The Call's course is all the more reprehensible from the fact that\r\nit had for two years been declaring for an effective Direct Primary law,\r\nand, indeed, assumed all the credit for the agitation for the reform.\r\n\r\n[45] The Leeds amendment, which the Call stated was in no way related to\r\nthe McCartney amendment, read as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Party candidates for the office of United States Senator shall have\r\ntheir names placed on the official primary election ballots of their\r\nrespective parties in the manner herein provided for State officers,\r\nprovided, however, that the vote for candidates for United States\r\nSenator shall be an advisory vote for the purpose of ascertaining the\r\nsentiment of the voters of the respective Senatorial and Assembly\r\nDistricts in the respective parties.\"\r\n\r\nThe McCartney amendment of that section of the bill dealing with the\r\nnomination of Senators read:\r\n\r\n\"Amend the bill so as to give an advisory vote by districts on United\r\nStates Senators.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the Leeds amendment and the McCartney amendment\r\nwere not remotely, but very closely related; were, in effect, the same.\r\n\r\n[46] A similar example of Pulcifer's trickiness attended the defeat in\r\nthe Assembly of Boynton's Senate bill providing for a nonpartisan column\r\non the election ballot for candidates for the Judiciary. The measure had\r\nthe backing of the reform element, and passed the Senate with but little\r\nopposition. At that time it would have had even easier sailing in the\r\nAssembly. But the machine succeeded in preventing action on the measure\r\nIn the Assembly until a few hours before adjournment. In the rush of the\r\nclose of the session, the measure, it is alleged, was made subject of\r\npretty vicious trading. But when it came to a showdown thirty-five votes\r\nwere cast for the measure and twenty-nine against. Six more votes would\r\nhave passed it. Had there been full attendance the bill would have been\r\npassed. A call of the House was ordered to compel such attendance, but\r\nwas finally discontinued, by Pulcifer, who had voted for the bill,\r\nvoting for discontinuance, thus tying the vote. This gave Speaker\r\nStanton an opportunity to end proceedings under the call of the House,\r\nby casting the deciding vote against continuance. Stanton, with\r\nPulcifer's assistance, thus cast what was practically the deciding vote\r\nthat killed the bill. Had the call of the House been continued until all\r\nthe Assemblymen were brought in, the measure would probably have been\r\npassed.\r\n\r\n[47] The vote in full was as follows:\r\n\r\nFor the amendment and against the bill as it had passed the Senate:\r\nBarndollar, Beatty, Beban, Black, Butler, Coghlan, Collier, Collum,\r\nCronin, Cullen, Feeley, Greer, Hammon, Hanlon, Hans, Hawk, Grove L.\r\nJohnson, Johnson of San Diego, Johnston of Contra Costa, Leeds,\r\nLightner, Macauley, McClellan, McManus, Melrose, Mott, Nelson, O'Neil,\r\nPerine, Pugh, Pulcifer, Rech, Rutherford, Schmitt, Stanton, Transue,\r\nWagner, Wheelan - 38.\r\n\r\nAgainst the amendment and for the bill as it passed the Senate:\r\nBeardslee, Bohnett, Callan, Cattell, Cogswell, Costar, Dean, Drew,\r\nFlint, Gerdes, Gibbons, Gillis, Griffiths, Hayes, Hewitt, Hinkle,\r\nHolmquist, Irwin, Johnson of Placer, Juilliard, Kehoe, Maher,\r\nMendenhall, Moore, Odom, Otis, Polsley, Preston, Sackett, Silver,\r\nStuckenbruck, Telfer, Whitney, Wilson, Wyllie, Young - 36.\r\n\r\n[48] When a bill passed by the Senate is amended in the Assembly the\r\nmeasure goes back to the Senate. If the Senate concur in the amendments,\r\nthat settles the matter. But if the Senate refuse to concur, then the\r\nbill goes back to the Assembly, where that body may recede from its\r\namendments or refuse to recede.\r\n\r\nIf the Assembly recede, the measure goes to the Governor just as it\r\npassed the Senate. If the Assembly refuse to recede, the measure is\r\nreferred to a conference committee of six, three appointed by the\r\nSpeaker of the Assembly and three by the President of the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe Conference Committee may consider only the amendments adopted by the\r\nAssembly. If the Conference Committee fail to agree, or if either Senate\r\nor Assembly reject its report, then the bill goes to a Committee on Free\r\nConference. The Committee on Free Conference is permitted to make any\r\namendment it sees fit. If its report be rejected by either Senate or\r\nAssembly, the bill gets no further; is dead, without possibility of\r\nresurrection.\r\n\r\nSuch was the maze of technicality into which Lincoln-Roosevelt Leaguer\r\nPulcifer threw the Direct Primary bill when he changed his vote from no\r\nto aye on the Leeds amendment.\r\n\r\n[49a] The postponements were made from hour to hour. The reform Senators\r\nwould be informed that the matter would be taken up at eleven o'clock in\r\nthe forenoon. At that hour, the machine would postpone consideration\r\nuntil three o'clock in the afternoon. At three o'clock, further\r\npostponement would be ordered until eight o'clock. At eight o'clock\r\nthere would be postponement until the next morning. Twenty-one votes\r\nwere necessary for concurrence in the Assembly Amendments, but a\r\nmajority of those voting was sufficient to secure postponement. The\r\nmachine on this issue controlled twenty votes, one short of enough for\r\nconcurrence, but one more than the nineteen controlled by the\r\nanti-machine element, and hence enough to postpone from hour to hour\r\nconsideration of Wolfe's motion.\r\n\r\n[49] It is very amusing less than three months later to see those\r\npartners of the Direct Primary fight, P. H. McCarthy and the San\r\nFrancisco Call, in fierce political conflict at San Francisco.\r\n\r\n[50] The resolutions adopted at Palo Alto read: \"Resolved, That we note\r\nwith disapproval the changed attitude of the San Francisco Call upon the\r\nDirect Primary bill, and its attempt to discredit Senator Black and\r\nother friends of good government in the Legislature.\"\r\n\r\n[51] Senator Black's letter covered the situation fully. It was\r\naddressed to the press of the State, and was as follows: \"No decent\r\nprimary law would have been possible but for the combination of thirteen\r\nRepublicans and seven Democrats in the Senate who have stood together\r\nthroughout this whole fight. Senator Wright and the 'Call' were\r\npowerless in the contest until these twenty Senators got behind them.\r\n\r\n\"One of the conditions of this combination was a State-wide vote on\r\nUnited States Senator, and the 'Call' fought with us against Senators\r\nWolfe and Leavitt on this proposition. Immediately after the bill left\r\nthe Senate and got into the Assembly the 'Call' began to display a lack\r\nof interest in the primary fight. If it had maintained its attitude in\r\nfavor of the original bill these amendments never would have been\r\nproposed by the Assembly.\"\r\n\r\n\"When the question of concurring in the Assembly amendments comes up, we\r\nfind the 'Call' and Senator Wright deserting the men who made the\r\nprimary fight in the Senate and going over to the camp of the 'push'\r\npoliticians, who have always favored the district plan of nominating\r\nUnited States Senators.\"\r\n\r\n\"I take issue with the 'Call' when it says: 'As a matter of fact, the\r\nwhole question of the United States Senatorship is of little importance\r\nto the people of California,' etc.\"\r\n\r\n\"The United States Senatorship is the most important office to be filled\r\nby the people of California under the provisions of the proposed Direct\r\nPrimary law. The so-called district plan for nominating United States\r\nSenators is worse than a makeshift. it provides for no pledge on the\r\npart of candidates and would be purely a straw vote, binding on nobody.\"\r\n\r\n\"The stubborn fact remains that the 'Call,' after leading in the fight\r\nfor an honest Direct Primary law for two years and a half, has deserted\r\nthe cause of the people at the most critical moment of the struggle.\"\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"MARSHALL BLACK.\"\r\n\r\n[52] The Star's clever editorial article is worth preserving. It was in\r\nfull as follows: \"There are times, it appears, when the illness of a\r\nstatesman is good for the people. We do not desire to wish Senator\r\nStetson any bad luck, but if his slight indisposition should continue\r\nfor a few days, or, in lieu of that, if some other solon of the same\r\nfaith as regards the Primary bill, can only contract some minor ailment,\r\nthere will be more joy than sorrow among the people who want something\r\napproaching a real direct primary.\r\n\r\n\"As explained in The Star's news columns, had Senator Stetson not been\r\nill, a tie vote on the proposition to concur with the Assembly in\r\namending the primary bill, presumably in the interest of Senator Frank\r\nFlint and generally to machine advantage, would have occurred. And then\r\n- it's unkind to say such things - any person with a grain of sense\r\nwould know that Mr. 'Performing' Porter, our honored and distinguished\r\nLieutenant-Governor, would break the tie by casting his vote for the\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\n\"The evident intention of Senators who stand for the Wright bill in its\r\noriginal form, which is a start toward a real direct primary (and that\r\ndoesn't include Senator Wright, more's the pity) to dodge the\r\npossibility of the tie vote by absenting themselves without leave is\r\nregrettable - regrettable only because it is necessary. Their action,\r\nwith the aim of serving the best interests of the people, is highly\r\nhonorable compared with the tactics of the powers that be, even unto the\r\nGovernor himself, who have been trying every means to club legislators\r\ninto line to stand by the 'organization' and defeat the will of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\"It's hard to be very sorry just now over Senator Stetson's illness, but\r\nhe deserves a vote of thanks for contracting that cold. And another for\r\nbeing on the right side.\"\r\n\r\n[53] The Weed resolution reads as follows: \"Resolved, By the Senate of\r\nthe State of California, That the President of the Senate be and he is\r\nhereby authorized to instruct the Sergeant-at-Arms to Proceed at once to\r\nPalo Alto with a competent physician, to be named by the President of\r\nthe Senate, for the purpose of ascertaining whether it is safe for\r\nSenator Black to proceed at once to Sacramento, to attend as a member of\r\nthe Senate the thirty-eighth session of the California Legislature, and\r\n\r\n\"Be it further resolved, That in the event that such examination results\r\nin disclosing a state of health wherein it will be safe for Senator\r\nBlack to be present, then the Sergeant-at-Arms shall bring him at once\r\nto Sacramento and, if necessary, to secure an engine and coach for that\r\npurpose.\"\r\n\r\n[54] Black's answering telegram was in full as follows: \"I beg to inform\r\nyou (Lieutenant-Governor Porter) and through you the Senate of\r\nCalifornia that I regard the resolutions adopted last Saturday in\r\nreference to my absence, as discourteous, as a reflection on my honor\r\nand integrity and as proposing an infringement on my privileges and\r\nrights as a Senator and citizen. I have, therefore declined to see the\r\npersons sent here under that resolution, and shall continue to decline\r\nto see them until my physicians inform me that I can with safety return\r\nto Sacramento.\r\n\r\n\"Ample evidence of my physical condition has been presented to your\r\nrepresentatives by four reputable physicians, and these physicians have\r\nfurnished and will furnish evidence of my condition from time to time as\r\nrequested by you or by the Senate.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"MARSHALL BLACK.\"\r\n\r\n[55] Dr. Montgomery's $400 report will be found in the appendix.\r\n\r\n[56] The schemes resorted to to get Black back to Sacramento are almost\r\nbeyond belief. It was even intimated to him that his bills would be held\r\nup if he did not return. The following telegram scarcely requires\r\ncomment:\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSacramento Cal Mch 20-09\r\nHon. Marshall Black,\r\n\r\nPalo Alto, Cal.\r\n\r\nYour bill to issue bonds for general improvement fund before me. I would\r\nlike to have you here to explain its provisions and the necessity for\r\nit.\r\n12-50Pm\t\t\t\t\tJ. N. GILLETT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XI.\r\n\r\nMachine Amends Direct Primary Bill[57].\r\n\r\nBy Trick Prevents Senate From Concurring in Amendments to Correct\r\nClerical and Typographical Errors, Thus Creating a Situation Which Threw\r\nthe Measure Into a Committee on Free Conference With Power to Amend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a very good rule to be sure that your rattlesnake is dead before\r\nplacing yourself in a position to be bitten. The reform Senators\r\nneglected this rule, with the result that after they had the machine\r\nelement whipped on the direct primary issue, they placed themselves in\r\na position where the \"performers\" struck at them viciously, and snatched\r\nvictory from them.\r\n\r\nAs was shown in a previous chapter, the Direct Primary bill, after it\r\nhad originally passed the Senate in the face of machine opposition, was\r\nallowed to go to the Assembly containing several serious clerical and\r\ntypographical errors. The Assembly corrected these errors by a series of\r\nten amendments. It was necessary for the Senate to concur in these\r\namendments to get the bill into proper form. The amendments added in the\r\nAssembly to which the anti-machine Senators took exception, were seven\r\nin number and dealt principally with the changing of the method of\r\nelecting United States Senators, from the plan of State-wide vote, to\r\nthat of district, advisory vote. The seven were known as the \"vicious\r\namendments\"; the ten correcting the typographical errors were called the\r\n\"necessary amendments.\" There is no good reason why the ten necessary\r\namendments should not have been made before the bill was first sent to\r\nthe Assembly. But they were not, and the errors which were thus left in\r\nthe bill served the machine most advantageously when the final fight\r\ncame. After Wolfe had given up hope of compelling the reform Senators to\r\nconcur in the vicious amendments read into the bill in the Assembly, his\r\nplay was to bring about a situation by which the bill would be thrown\r\ninto a Committee on Free Conference. The committee would be appointed by\r\nPresident Porter of the Senate, and by Speaker Stanton of the Assembly.\r\nSuch a committee would, of course, be in sympathy with machine policies,\r\nand could be counted upon to amend the bill to the machine's liking.\r\nThere is little doubt that the machine leaders in the Senate and the\r\nmachine leaders in the Assembly acted in conjunction in the proceedings\r\nwhich followed Senator Wolfe's action in abandoning his efforts to force\r\nthe anti-machine Senators to support the so called vicious Assembly\r\namendments.\r\n\r\nWolfe's first move was to ask as a matter of courtesy that the Senate\r\nadopt his motion to reconsider the vote by which it had the week before\r\nrefused to concur in the Assembly amendment. This request the reform\r\nelement granted, purely as a matter of courtesy. Wolfe then edged up a\r\nstep nearer.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had he received the courtesy of reconsideration than both he\r\nand Leavitt were to the fore with a suggestion that the Senate should\r\nrefuse to concur in all the amendments and let them be threshed out in\r\nthe Assembly. The purpose of the two machine leaders was apparent.\r\n\r\nHad the Senate concurred in the ten Assembly amendments made necessary\r\nto correct typographical errors, and refused to concur in the seven\r\nobjectionable amendments, all that would have been necessary would have\r\nbeen for the Assembly to recede from its objectionable amendments. But\r\nif Wolfe could so engineer matters that the Senate would refuse to\r\nconcur in all the amendments, then it would be necessary for the\r\nAssembly to recede from all its amendments, including those intended to\r\ncorrect typographical errors, or send the bill to a conference\r\ncommittee, to be selected by Stanton and Porter. From a Committee on\r\nConference to a Committee on Free Conference, also to be appointed by\r\nStanton and Porter, and with full power to amend the bill to its liking,\r\nwas but a step. The Committee on Free Conference was Wolfe's aim. He\r\neventually got it.\r\n\r\nBoynton and Walker were quick to see the trend of Wolfe's requests,\r\nhowever, and Walker moved to vote on the seven vicious amendments on one\r\nroll call, and on the ten correcting the typographical and clerical\r\nerrors on a second.\r\n\r\nAs a substitute Wolfe moved that the seventeen amendments be passed upon\r\nunder one roll call.\r\n\r\nAt first Senators Cutten and Stetson apparently could not see the trend\r\nof Wolfe's scheming. In the debate that ensued Wolfe pretended\r\nindignation that his motives were being questioned.\r\n\r\nThere was very good reason for questioning Senator Wolfe's motives, but\r\nCutten and Stetson and even Walker assured Wolfe that no reflection upon\r\nhim was intended. What these men should have done was to have denounced\r\nWolfe right there as a trickster and made no bones about it. But on the\r\nabsurd assumption that a member of the State Senate is necessarily a\r\ngentleman, the much deserved denunciation did not come.\r\n\r\nHowever, Wolfe's motion did not prevail and the amendments were taken up\r\none by one. Six of the seven vicious amendments were rejected, the first\r\nof the six by a vote of 19 to 20.\r\n\r\nThis brought the Senate to the amendments intended to correct\r\ntypographical and clerical errors. And here the vote switched. The\r\nreformers had up to this time been voting to reject the amendments,\r\nbecause the amendments were objectionable, while the programmers in the\r\nfirst instance voted for concurrence. But when it came to amendments\r\nintended to correct typographical and clerical errors only, Wolfe and\r\nhis following, with the exception of Burnett, who refused to stand for\r\nany such dastardly piece of work, voted to refuse to concur in the\r\namendments, while the anti-machine Senators, of course, voted to concur\r\nin them.\r\n\r\nBurnett, voting with the anti-machine element, gave them twenty votes,\r\nleaving Wolfe and his following only nineteen. But twenty-one votes were\r\nnecessary for concurrence. The machine, while it could not force the\r\nSenate to concur in the vicious amendments, could prevent the Senate's\r\nconcurrence in the amendments to correct the clerical and typographical\r\nerrors. The bill was accordingly sent back to the Assembly with the\r\ntypographical and clerical amendments still in dispute.\r\n\r\nEven before the bill had reached the Assembly, Senator Frank Leavitt and\r\nGeorge Van Smith of The Call were on the floor of that body, fighting to\r\nprevent the Assembly receding from its amendments.\r\n\r\nWhen the Assembly grasped the fact that the Senate had refused to concur\r\nin the amendments necessary for correction of typographical errors,\r\nthose who were working for an effective Direct Primary bill were thrown\r\ninto the greatest confusion. Speaker Stanton's rulings which followed,\r\nwere not calculated to relieve the situation. Speaking from the desk,\r\nStanton said:\r\n\r\n\"If you recede from some of these amendments and not from others where\r\nwill your bill be? It will be dead. The only thing that you can do to\r\nsave the Direct Primary bill now is to recede from all the amendments\r\nand let the typographical errors remain in the bill, or refuse to recede\r\nfrom any of the amendments and let the bill go into conference. If you\r\nrecede from some of the amendments and not from others, your bill is\r\ndead. We cannot send this bill back to the Senate saying that the\r\nAssembly has receded from some of the amendments and not from others.\"\r\n\r\nAssemblymen Preston, Bohnett and others who were standing for an\r\neffective measure, were amazed at the position which Stanton had taken.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot for the life of me,\" said Preston, \"see why we cannot recede\r\nfrom part of the amendments and refuse to recede from the others. Some\r\nof these amendments are really necessary for the good of the bill.\r\nOthers should be rejected. Give me fifteen minutes and I will guarantee\r\nto dig up authorities which will show us the course to be pursued.\"\r\n\r\nAssemblyman Bohnett confessed himself unable to understand why the\r\nAssembly could not send part of the amendments to conference and not the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nBy this time matters had got so warm in the Assembly that Senator\r\nLeavitt found it necessary to lend dignity to the occasion by taking his\r\nseat at the side of Speaker Stanton, whom he engaged in conversation.\r\nThe conference was, of course, carried on in whispers.\r\n\r\nAssemblymen Young, Bohnett and others, finding that it would be\r\nimpossible under the assumption of the Speaker to refuse to recede from\r\npart of the amendments while receding from the others, advised the good\r\ngovernment members to refuse to recede from all the amendments, and pass\r\nthe bill, typographical errors and all.\r\n\r\nIt was demanded of Bohnett if this would not lead to the practical\r\ndefeat of the measure. Bohnett insisted that it would not; that the\r\ntypographical errors, while deplorable, did not materially affect the\r\nbill.\r\n\r\nHowever, many of the better element of the Assembly did not dare to take\r\nthe risk, and the motion to recede was lost by a vote of 29 to 42[51].\r\n\r\nAssemblymen who unquestionably stood for a good bill voted against\r\nreceding. Had the vicious amendments alone been under consideration,\r\nthey would have voted to recede. Among these were such men as\r\nAssemblyman Drew of Fresno. The Assembly, having refused to recede from\r\nits amendments, the bill went to a Committee on Conference, appointed by\r\nSpeaker Stanton and President Porter. The machine had gained its point.\r\n\r\nThe Conference Committee consisted of Senators Wolfe, Leavitt and\r\nWright, and Assemblymen Leeds, Johnson of Sacramento, and Hewitt. Of the\r\nCommittee, Hewitt[59] was the only member who favored a Statewide vote\r\nfor United States Senator, and opposed the advisory district vote. The\r\ncommittee had scarcely been missed from Senate and Assembly chambers\r\nbefore it was back to report that no agreement could be reached.\r\n\r\nThe same members were thereupon appointed as a Committee on Free\r\nConference, which gave them power to amend the bill. As a Committee on\r\nFree Conference they recommended the advisory district vote plan for the\r\nnomination of United States Senators[60].\r\n\r\nSenator Wolfe, having got the bill in shape to his liking, with a suave\r\nsmirk upon his face, stated that he trusted that all the Senators\r\npresent would vote for the measure.\r\n\r\n\"Not on your life,\" came Caminetti's protest.\r\n\r\nAnd Caminetti did not vote for the Free Conference Committee's report.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of Caminetti's protest, both Senate and Assembly adopted\r\nthe Conference Committee's report. They had to do so or defeat the bill\r\nentirely. Caminetti was the only Senator who voted against it. The\r\nmachine, after a fight of nearly two months, in which it was twice\r\ndefeated in the Senate, and escaped defeat in the Assembly by only one\r\nvote, that of Pulcifer, had carried its point, had succeeded in denying\r\nthe people of California the privilege of casting a practical,\r\nState-wide vote for United States Senators.\r\n\r\nWhat the anti-machine Senators[61] thought of the outcome is best\r\nexpressed in the little speech which Senator Stetson made his\r\nfellow-Senators in explaining his vote to accept the report of the\r\nCommittee on Free Conference.\r\n\r\n\"Before voting on this matter,\" said Stetson, \"lest any one in the\r\nfuture may think that I have been passed something and didn't know it, I\r\nwish to explain my vote, and wish to say that this permission accorded a\r\ncandidate to go on record to support that candidate for United States\r\nSenate, who shall have the endorsement of the greatest number of\r\ndistricts, comes from nobody and goes to nobody. It means nothing -\r\nmere words - idle words. The only way in which a candidate could have\r\nbeen pledged would have been to provide a pledge or instructions to the\r\nLegislature. The words 'shall be permitted' mean nothing and get\r\nnowhere. I shall vote for this report, not because I want to, but\r\nbecause I have to if we are at this session to have any Direct Primary\r\nlaw at all.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[57] The plain citizen will marvel at the lengths to which the machine\r\nwent to prevent a provision being incorporated into the Direct Primary\r\nbill for the selection by State-wide vote of United States Senators. The\r\nplain citizen does not, however, look upon a United States Senator\r\nthrough the same eyes as the machine. To the plain citizen that United\r\nStates Senator is desirable who represents policies beneficial to his\r\ncountry and his State; to the machine that United States Senator is\r\ndesirable who will in effect turn his Federal patronage over to the\r\nmachine. The election of United States Senators by State-wide vote would\r\ntake their appointment out of machine hands, which would mean loss to\r\nthe machine of Federal patronage. For this reason the almost\r\nunbelievable lengths to which the machine went to prevent the provision\r\nfor State-wide vote for the election of United States Senators being\r\nincorporated into the Direct Primary bill.\r\n\r\n[58] The vote was as follows:\r\n\r\nAyes: Messrs. Bohnett, Callan, Cattell, Cogswell, Collum, Costar,\r\nFlavelle, Gerdes, Gibbons, Gillis, Hinkle, Holmquist, Irwin, Johnson of\r\nPlacer, Juilliard, Kehoe, Maher, Mendenhall, Odom, Otis, Polsley,\r\nPreston, Sackett, Stuckenbruck, Telfer, Whitney, Wilson, Wyllie and\r\nYoung - 29.\r\n\r\nNoes: Messrs.

Senators Campbell,\r\nHolohan and Miller sent to the Secretary's desk the following\r\nexplanation of their votes: \"We voted for the Direct Primary bill\r\nbecause it seems to be the best law that can be obtained under existing\r\npolitical conditions. We are opposed to many of the features of this\r\nbill, and believe that the people at the first opportunity will instruct\r\ntheir representatives in the Legislature to radically amend the same in\r\nmany particulars, notably in regard to the election of United States\r\nSenators, and the provisions that prevent the endorsement of a candidate\r\nby a political party or organization other than the one that first\r\nnominated such candidate.\"\r\n\r\nA second protest, signed by Senators Curtin, Cartwright and Sanford, was\r\nalso printed in the Journal. It reads as follows: \"We voted to adopt the\r\nreport of the Committee on Free Conference on Senate Bill No. 3, not\r\nbecause we believe it to be what is desired by the people of this State,\r\nbut because we believe it to be the only bill that can be adopted at\r\nthis late hour, as the Legislature is about to adjourn.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XII.\r\n\r\nThe Railroad Regulation Issue.\r\n\r\nRecent Increase in Freight Tariff Had Brought About a Condition Which\r\nRequired Action - Senate Divided Into Supporters of an Effective and\r\nSupporters of an Ineffective Measure - Manipulation by Which Measures\r\nWere Placed in Hands of a Machine-Controlled Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome one has very well said that the real test of a Legislature is its\r\naction on railroad measures. The Legislature of 1909, if estimated by\r\nthis standard would not appear to advantage. But to condemn the\r\nLegislature of 1909 for its failure to give the State an effective\r\nrailroad regulation law, is to condemn every Legislature that has sat in\r\nCalifornia since the present State Constitution went into effect thirty\r\nyears ago. The Constitution empowers the Legislature to pass effective\r\nrailroad regulation measures, but up to the session of 1909, the\r\nmachine, or system, or organization - one name is as fragrant as another\r\n- had prevented the passage, if we exclude the ineffective Act of 1880,\r\nof any railroad regulation law at all. The machine has ever moved\r\nagainst the interests of the people and in the interest of its\r\ndominating factor and at the same time its chief beneficiary, the\r\nSouthern Pacific Railroad Company. It has so manipulated the nomination\r\nand election of Railroad Commissioners as to keep in that office men\r\nutterly dominated by railroad influences.\r\n\r\nWith weak and corrupt men as Railroad Commissioners, and\r\nmachine-dominated Legislatures which have neglected to pass laws which\r\nwould have made the Commission effective, or even provide funds for the\r\nCommission to carry on its work, even had the Commissioners been so\r\ninclined, California has been left helpless to oppose any extortion\r\nwhich the railroad might see fit to exact. The system of charging all\r\nthat the traffic will bear has governed utterly. For this the Southern\r\nPacific Company can thank, and the People of California condemn, the\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\nThe cost to the people has been enormous. It was pretty conclusively\r\nshown at the Legislative investigation into the cause of recent advance\r\nof freight rates, that upwards of $10,000,000[62] a year has in this one\r\ninstance been added to the freight charges exacted from the people of\r\nthe Pacific Coast. The added burden falls upon the Pacific Coast\r\nmanufacturer, merchant, farmer, fruit grower, consumer. All from the\r\nhighest to the lowest help pay the tribute. Thirty years is a long\r\nperiod, and the arm of the railroad tribute-taker far-reaching. The vast\r\nsums which, unrestricted, the Southern Pacific has been able to exact\r\nrun into enormous totals. From a dollar and cent standpoint, it has paid\r\nthe Southern Pacific Company to control the machine.\r\n\r\nBut the railroad's absolute domination of the State could not continue\r\nforever without protest that would eventually force a hearing. This\r\nprotest came toward the close of 1908. The increase in freight rates\r\nmade just before the Legislature of 1909 convened emphasized the\r\nnecessity for the enactment of a law that should galvanize the Railroad\r\nCommission into activity; ensure the enforcement of constitutional\r\nprovisions for the protection of the public against dominant\r\ntransportation companies; in a word, provide effective railroad\r\nregulation.\r\n\r\nGovernor Gillett in his biennial message to the Legislature, and\r\nAttorney General Webb in his biennial report gave expression to this\r\naroused public sentiment.\r\n\r\nGeneral Webb, after reviewing railroad conditions in California, on page\r\n13 of his report says: \"It is thus apparent that the shippers of the\r\nState are practically helpless.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe,\" continues the Attorney General, \"that this review of the\r\nsituation will show the imperative necessity of prompt legislation on\r\nthis subject, and under the Constitution of this State, the Legislature\r\nhas ample authority to enact the required legislation.\"\r\n\r\nGovernor Gillett, in his biennial message, takes practically the same\r\nstand as does Attorney General Webb.\r\n\r\n\"Our State,\" says the Governor on page 12 of his message, \"has not kept\r\npace with the majority of the States of the Union in the enactment of\r\nlaws regulating railroads in their business as common carriers.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can virtually promise you,\" said General Webb at a meeting of the\r\nSenate Committee on Corporations, held on the evening of January 25th,\r\n\"that in the event of this (the Stetson Railroad Regulation bill)\r\nbecoming a law, and the Railroad Commission refusing or neglecting to\r\nact under its provisions, the Governor will call the Legislature\r\ntogether in extraordinary session for their impeachment.\"[63]\r\n\r\nThere was no question of the aroused public sentiment in favor of the\r\npassage of a railroad regulation measure. Even before the Legislature\r\nconvened it became evident that some sort of a measure would have to be\r\npassed; even the railroad lobby saw that. The Legislature accordingly\r\ndivided on the question. As the fight was carried on in the Senate - the\r\nAssembly in the rush of the closing hours of the session merely putting\r\nits \"O. K.\" on what the Senate had done - the division in the Senate\r\nalone will be considered. The division in that body was:\r\n\r\n(1) The minority, made up of the out and out machine Republicans and\r\nDemocrats, who were prepared to pass a measure which under the name\r\nrailroad regulation would leave the railroads practically independent of\r\neffective State supervision.\r\n\r\n(2) The majority, which stood for the passage of an effective law.\r\n\r\nThe minority had the best captains in the Senate and was backed by the\r\nmachine lobby made up principally of Southern Pacific attorneys.\r\n\r\nThe majority was poor in generals. But it had the backing of the\r\nshippers of - the State, who sent able counsel to Sacramento to present\r\nthe shippers' side.\r\n\r\nAnd in the end the machine minority wore out and defeated the majority.\r\nA comparatively effective railroad regulation bill was rejected and an\r\nineffective measure passed.\r\n\r\nThree railroad regulation measures were introduced in the Senate, their\r\nauthors being Campbell, Stetson, and Wright.\r\n\r\nThe Campbell bill had much to commend it, but was rejected without much\r\nconsideration by either side. Campbell was not in the program of either\r\nrailroad or shippers. But before the session was over Campbell had made\r\nhimself felt. He had, too, introduced a Constitutional Amendment for the\r\ncorrection of railroad abuses, which was to figure later on, but his\r\nbill was scarcely considered. The attorney for the shippers, in speaking\r\nbefore the Senate Committee on Corporations, confessed that he had not\r\nread the Campbell bill.\r\n\r\nThe attorney for the Southern Pacific Company, however, attempted to\r\nsplit the anti-machine forces by praising the Campbell bill, and setting\r\nthe anti-machine Senators to disputing over the relative merits of the\r\nCampbell and Stetson bills. But nothing came of this graceful little\r\ncoup. Campbell and his followers were too sensible to be caught by any\r\nsuch trickery. They gave their loyal support to the Stetson bill, and\r\nthe Campbell bill was allowed to die in the Senate Judiciary Committee.\r\nThis narrowed the fight down to the Stetson bill and the Wright bill.\r\n\r\nThe Stetson bill had been prepared in the office of Attorney General\r\nWebb, and at the instigation of Governor Gillett. As originally\r\nintroduced it contained certain defects, which were afterwards\r\ncorrected, but such Senators as Cutten, Caminetti, Black, Campbell,\r\nMiller, Cartwright, Bell and Thompson, admitted that the measure could\r\nbe made the basis of as effective a law as could be prepared under the\r\npresent constitutional provisions for the regulation of transportation\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\nThe original measure was particularly weak in the section providing for\r\ndemurrage charges. This was finally corrected by the passage of a\r\nseparate reciprocal demurrage bill, which had been introduced by Miller.\r\nAnother weakness in the Stetson bill as originally introduced was that\r\nthe Railroad Commission was made a sort of barrier between the Courts\r\nand those who had grievances against the transportation companies. This\r\nobjection was corrected by amendments.\r\n\r\nNumerous other amendments adopted from time to time made the Stetson\r\nbill probably as effective as a California railroad regulation law can\r\nbe made, under the Constitutional provision which places extraordinary\r\npowers in the hands of the State Board of Railroad Commissioners.\r\n\r\nJust where the Wright bill originated nobody seems to know for\r\ncertainty. But Senator Wright introduced it. Senator Wright was well\r\nselected for the job. For two years he had been groomed as the reformer\r\nwho would introduce the State-saving Direct Primary Bill. So a railroad\r\nregulation measure introduced by Senator Wright might at least be\r\ncalculated to bear the stamp of respectability.\r\n\r\nLike the Stetson bill, the Wright bill was based on the constitutional\r\nprovisions which make the State Board of Railroad Commissioners the\r\ncenter of railroad regulation in California. And here the parallel ends.\r\n\r\nComparison of the two measures is not at all to the advantage of the\r\nWright bill.\r\n\r\nThe Stetson bill provided fine and imprisonment as penalty for\r\ninfringement of its provisions; the Wright bill provided fine only.\r\n\r\nThe Stetson bill had a definite anti-pass provision; the Wright bill as\r\noriginally introduced had no such provision.\r\n\r\nThe Stetson bill authorized not only the Attorney-General, but the\r\nDistrict Attorney of any county of the State to proceed to enforce its\r\nprovisions; the Wright bill granted the Attorney-General alone such\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nThe Stetson bill required the Railroad Commissioners to meet at least\r\nonce in every two weeks; the Wright bill provided that such meetings\r\nshould be held monthly.\r\n\r\nThe Stetson bill gave the Railroad Commissioners authority to make\r\nphysical valuation of railroad properties; the Wright bill contained no\r\nsuch provision.\r\n\r\nThe Stetson bill recognized all discriminations to be unjust; the Wright\r\nbill provided that no interference should be instituted unless the\r\ndiscriminations complained of were shown to be unjust.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, the Stetson bill provided that the State Board of Railroad\r\nCommissioners should have power to fix absolute rates, thus insuring\r\nstability of rate schedules, while the Wright bill provided that the\r\nCommissioners should fix maximum rates only, thus permitting the famous\r\n\"fluidity\" of schedules advocated by machine lobby and Southern Pacific\r\nattorneys.\r\n\r\nThe contest between the supporters of the Wright and the supporters of\r\nthe Stetson bill, finally narrowed down to the question of providing for\r\nabsolute or maximum rates.\r\n\r\nThe provision for the maximum rate in Senator Wright's bill, authorized\r\nthe railroad regulating Commission to fix the highest charge which a\r\nrailroad may exact from a shipper. This is called the maximum rate. The\r\ntransportation company is authorized to lower the rate at will, but it\r\ncannot charge a rate beyond the maximum as fixed by the Commission. This\r\nleaves the railroads to fix a sliding schedule of rates, so long as they\r\ndo not exceed the maximum. It gives the railroads the advantage of that\r\n\"fluidity\" of schedules, which railroad attorneys insist is necessary\r\nfor railroad prosperity.\r\n\r\nThe maximum rate is provided in the Interstate Commerce Act, but the\r\nInterstate Commerce Commissioners, finding it impracticable, have for\r\nyears been clamoring for Congress to authorize the fixing of absolute\r\nrates. The cry of the Interstate Commerce Commission has been taken up\r\nby the shipping interests, and from one end of the country to the other\r\nthere is growing demand that authority be placed somewhere to make\r\nrailroad rates, when fixed by a regulating Commission, absolute.\r\n\r\nThe absolute rate, or the fixed rate as it is better called, which was\r\nprovided in the Stetson bill, can neither be lowered nor raised by the\r\nrailroads. Once fixed by the regulating Commission, it must remain until\r\nthe Commission grants permission for its change. The railroads cannot\r\nlower it any more than they can raise it.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of the absolute rate are many. In the first place, where\r\nthe absolute rate is established, there can be no discrimination,\r\nbecause the rate is known, it can neither be raised nor lowered, and the\r\nrailroads have no opportunity to favor one shipper at the expense of\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, the shipper is guaranteed a stability of rate\r\nschedules which is deemed necessary for settled business conditions. The\r\nmerchant, for example, includes transportation charges in the cost price\r\nof the goods in which he deals. But if the transportation charges on the\r\nsame class of goods are subject to frequent change, the merchant can\r\nnever tell when his competitor is to be given the advantage of a sudden\r\nlowering in freight rates. This uncertainty unsettles business. The\r\nmerchant holds that transportation rates should be just as stable as\r\ntariff rates. On this account, the merchant advocates fixed rates and\r\nstability of schedules as against maximum rates and constantly shifting\r\nschedules.\r\n\r\nThe supporters of the Stetson bill, then, backed the shipping and\r\nmerchant classes; while the supporters of the Wright bill backed the\r\ncontentions of the transportation companies.\r\n\r\nThe Campbell and the Stetson bills had been originally referred to the\r\nSenate Judiciary Committee, while the Wright bill had been referred to\r\nthe Senate Committee on Corporations. For the first few weeks of the\r\nsession, no particular note had been taken of the Wright bill, attention\r\nbeing centered on the amendment of the Stetson bill.\r\n\r\nThings were going swimmingly with the Stetson bill, when the machine\r\nlobby awoke to the fact that something was wrong in the Senate. There\r\nwas at least some indication that the Senate would pass an effective\r\nrailroad regulation measure.\r\n\r\nAnd then, before the advocates of the Stetson measure could tell exactly\r\nwhat was happening, the railroad regulation measures were taken from the\r\nJudiciary Committee and placed in the hands of the Committee on\r\nCorporations.\r\n\r\nA glance at the personnel of the two Committees at least suggests why\r\nthis was done.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Judiciary Committee were Willis, Wolfe, Wright,\r\nMcCartney, Savage, Boynton, Anthony, Burnett, Cutten, Estudillo,\r\nMartinelli, Roseberry, Stetson, Thompson, Curtin, Cartwright, Caminetti,\r\nMiller, Campbell.\r\n\r\nThe nine Senators whose names are printed in Italics, when the issue\r\ncame to vote on the floor of the Senate, voted against the Stetson bill\r\nand for the Wright bill; nine of the ten whose names are printed in\r\nordinary letters voted for the Stetson bill and against the Wright bill.\r\nThe tenth, Roseberry, was absent, but when he found that the vote had\r\nbeen taken, stated that had he been present he would have voted for the\r\nStetson bill and against the Wright bill.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Estudillo, who finally voted for the Wright bill, did not\r\napprove the measure and voted for it because he feared the absolute rate\r\nfeature of the Stetson bill to be unconstitutional.\r\n\r\nThus at the time the Stetson and the Campbell bills were taken from the\r\nJudiciary Committee, the Committee was regarded as standing:\r\n\r\nFor the Wright bill - 8.\r\n\r\nAgainst the Wright bill - 11.\r\n\r\nFor the Stetson bill - 11.\r\n\r\nAgainst the Stetson bill - 8.\r\n\r\nIt was certainly not in the interest of the Stetson bill that the\r\nmeasure was taken from the Judiciary Committee and sent to the Committee\r\non Corporations.\r\n\r\nA glance at the personnel of the Committee on Corporations reveals a\r\nsignificant state of affairs. The Committee consisted of the following\r\nSenators: Bates, Welch, Wright, McCartney, Burnett, Bills, Walker,\r\nRoseberry, Finn, Miller, Kennedy.\r\n\r\nWhen the test came on the floor of the Senate, the nine of the eleven\r\nSenators whose names are printed in italics voted for the Wright bill\r\nand against the Stetson bill. The two members whose names are printed in\r\nordinary letters, voted for the Stetson bill, and against the Wright\r\nbill.\r\n\r\nThe line-up of the Committee on Corporations, when the measures were\r\ntaken from the Judiciary Committee and sent to the Committee on\r\nCorporations, was then:\r\n\r\nFor the Wright Bill - 9.\r\n\r\nAgainst the Wright Bill - 2.\r\n\r\nFor the Stetson Bill - 2.\r\n\r\nAgainst the Stetson Bill - 9.\r\n\r\nThe change was certainly not made in the interest of the Stetson bill.\r\n\r\nThe incident stirred up Campbell and other anti-machine Senators to the\r\nfighting pitch. An arrangement was made, however, by which the measures\r\nwere to be sent back to the Judiciary Committee after the Committee on\r\nCorporations got through with them that the Judiciary Committee might\r\npass upon their constitutionality. The arrangement had two effects - it\r\nsilenced the unquieting protest of the anti-machine Senators, and it\r\ndelayed consideration of the bills. But, as the sequel showed, the\r\narrangement did not help the Stetson bill in the least.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[62] The testimony was that of George J. Bradley, traffic manager of the\r\nMerchants' and Manufacturers' Traffic Association of Sacramento. It was\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\nIt is estimated on conservative figures that the increase in eastbound\r\nCalifornia products, or Pacific Coast products, I should correctly say,\r\nwhich is composed of canned fruits, canned vegetables and canned salmon,\r\nof which there are several million cases, go from the North Pacific\r\ncoast through either San Francisco or through the North Pacific coast,\r\nthe minimum being forty thousand pounds to the car, and the increase\r\nbeing ten cents per hundred pounds, means forty dollars a car increase.\r\nNow, taking the number of cars of all those products that are shipped,\r\nit amounted to about - and leather and other products - it amounted to\r\nabout four million dollars eastbound. Now, when the question of\r\nwestbound comes out, of course, it is practically impossible for any man\r\nto say just exactly what that increase will mean in dollars and cents,\r\nand the only way, therefore, to arrive at it is to take the percentage\r\nof proportion now in their westbound tariff, which is composed of about\r\nbetween eight hundred and a thousand items. They have raised the rates\r\nfrom 10 to 25 cents on over two hundred articles, all of which move in\r\nquantities; in other words, the process by which the tariff has been\r\namended has been that in every instance where there was a commodity\r\nmoving in quantities the rate has been advanced; wherever there was no\r\nmovement and they wished to encourage a movement, they reduced the rate.\r\nNow, you take the five transcontinental lines that operate on the\r\nPacific Coast, namely, the Northern Pacific and the Great Northern on\r\nthe north and the Canadian Pacific; the Southern Pacific and the Santa\r\nFe and the San Pedro and Los Angeles on the south, give you six trunk\r\nlines operating on the Pacific Coast. If you will take their gross\r\nearnings, which amount to over four hundred millions, segregate that by\r\nallowing fifty per cent of that to passenger service, which is a very\r\nconservative estimate, because the passenger service does not amount to\r\nthat, leaves two hundred million dollars of gross freight earnings. Take\r\nfive per cent of that for terminal business, and business is based on\r\nterminal rates from the coast, plus the local back, because the rate, of\r\ncourse, is felt everywhere, the rates to the interior points are made on\r\nthe terminal rate, plus the local back. Take five per cent of that and\r\ntheir increase in every instance has been 10 per cent, and in some cases\r\n16 2/3 and 20 per cent; but take a very liberal conservative estimate\r\nand put it at five per cent and you have ten million dollars; now, split\r\nthat in two and take two and a half per cent of it and you have got five\r\nmillions of dollars. Now, that and your four million dollars on\r\neastbound freight and you have nine millions of dollars increase in\r\nfreight rates, and I believe that that is a conservative estimate. I\r\ndon't see how you could get at it any closer, because every man, it\r\ndoesn't make any difference where he is, every man that buys pays that\r\nten to twenty per cent increase.\r\n\r\n[63] Senator Caminetti on February 12 introduced a concurrent resolution\r\ncalling for the removal of the present Board of Railroad Commissioners\r\nfrom office. The Committee on Corporations  reported adversely, and on\r\nMarch 15th the resolution was finally rejected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIII.\r\n\r\nMachine Defeats the Stetson Bill.\r\n\r\nSouthern Pacific Attorney Succeeds in Clouding the Issue - Railroad\r\nClaquers Active in Advocating the Maximum Rate, Which Was Designated as\r\nLittle Better Than No Rate At All - No Fight Over the Bill in the\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving succeeded in transferring the railroad regulation measures from\r\nthe Senate Judiciary Committee, the majority of whose members were\r\nanti-machine, to the Committee on Corporations, the majority of whose\r\nmembers were machine, the machine proceeded to discredit the Stetson\r\nbill, by making it appear that the State Constitution by implication\r\nprohibits the fixing of absolute railroad rates, and provides that the\r\nRailroad Commissioners may fix maximum rates only. Peter F. Dunne was\r\nbrought to Sacramento to make this argument before the Senate Committee\r\non Corporations.\r\n\r\nDunne, in his address, showed greater ability than integrity. When he\r\nhad finished, even the anti-machine members of the Committee were\r\ncompletely befuddled. Walker, one of the members of the Committee who is\r\nnot a lawyer, groped in utter darkness thereafter, until he finally\r\nstumbled into the arms of Eddie Wolfe and Frank Leavitt and Jere Burke,\r\nwhen the final vote on the railroad bills was taken. It was Walker's\r\nonly stumble of the session. But for his unfortunate vote against the\r\nStetson bill and for the Wright bill, Walker would have made an\r\nexceptionally clean record.\r\n\r\nNot only did Dunne befog the lay Senators of the Committee, he shook the\r\nfaith of men like Miller and Roseberry - both lawyers - on the\r\nconstitutionality of the absolute rate. Miller recognizes that the\r\nabsolute rate is the only practical rate; but until the end of the\r\nsession he was not prepared to say that it could be constitutionally\r\nestablished. Dunne certainly did a good job. To be sure, his address was\r\na mass of misrepresentations, but of misrepresentations cunningly put.\r\nHe shattered the implicit faith of the anti-machine Senators in the\r\nabsolute rate. And that was what he had been sent to Sacramento to do.\r\nThe evil that Dunne did lived long after he had left the capital.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, neither the term \"absolute rate\" nor \"maximum rate\"\r\nappears in the State Constitution.\r\n\r\nArticle XII, Section 22, of the Constitution, provides that the Railroad\r\nCommissioners \"shall have the power and it shall be their duty to\r\nestablish rates of charges for the transportation of passengers and\r\nfreight by railroad or other transportation companies.\"\r\n\r\nFurther on in the same section, it is provided that \"any railroad\r\ncorporation or transportation company which shall fail or refuse to\r\nconform to such rates as shall be established by such Commissioners, or\r\nshall charge rates in excess thereof, * * * shall be fined not exceeding\r\n$20,000 for each offense.\"\r\n\r\nThe dispute between those who stood for maximum rates - that is to say,\r\nthe members of the machine lobby, the machine Senators, the Southern\r\nPacific attorneys and those who wanted absolute rates - namely, the\r\nanti-machine Senators and the attorneys representing large shipping\r\ninterests - waxed hot over the words in the above quotation which are\r\nprinted in Italics.\r\n\r\nThe advocates of the absolute rate held, with at least apparent reason,\r\nthat the words \"fail to conform to such rates\" mean just what the\r\ndictionaries say they do: That the railroad charging a rate in excess of\r\nthat fixed by the Railroad Commissioners, or a rate less than that fixed\r\nby the Commissioners, is not conforming to the rates. Such, at least,\r\nseems reasonable construction of a very simple phrase.\r\n\r\nBut not so, insisted the railroad lobby. That aggregation of patriots\r\nskimmed over the words \"fail to conform to such rates,\" and saw only,\r\n\"or shall charge in excess thereof.\" Inasmuch, the pro-railroad element\r\nheld, as the Constitution says that the railroads shall not charge in\r\nexcess of the rates fixed by the Railroad Commissioners, the railroads\r\nare at liberty to reduce the rates as fixed by the Commissioners at\r\nwill. In other words, according to the pro-railroad element, the\r\nConstitution authorizes the fixing of maximum rates only.\r\n\r\nThe pro-railroad claquers even went so far as to claim that the Supreme\r\nCourt has decided that the maximum rate is the only rate that can be\r\nfixed under the State Constitution. They referred the doubtful to the\r\nnotorious decision in the Fresno passenger rate case known as the Edson\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\nBut no question of maximum rates was involved in the Edson case. To be\r\nsure, Chief Justice Beatty took occasion to say in his opinion in that\r\ncase that his understanding had been that the State Constitution\r\nprovides for the maximum rate. But this had no place in the decision,\r\nwas purely dictum, and is so regarded.\r\n\r\nAttorney-General Webb has an ingenious but very plausible explanation of\r\nJudge Beatty's much-discussed observation. General Webb points out that\r\nprevious to the adoption of the present State Constitution - 1879 -\r\nJustice Beatty had been engaged in the active practice of the law in\r\nthis State. Up to the time of the adoption of the Constitution of 1879\r\nthe maximum rate had prevailed in California. About that time, Judge\r\nBeatty went to Nevada and was absent from the State for several years.\r\nReturning to California, after the State Constitution had been adopted,\r\nJudge Beatty found no case in which the duties of the Railroad\r\nCommissioners had been involved, until the Edson case came up.\r\n\r\n\"I am of the opinion,\" said General Webb in discussing this point, \"that\r\nwhen the Chief justice spoke of the maximum rate in the Edson case he\r\nwas governed by mental impressions received previous to 1879, when the\r\nmaximum rate was indeed the rule in California.\"\r\n\r\nAll this was a very pretty theory. To the common-sense mind \"conform to\r\nthe rates fixed\" might mean conform to them; the normal man might be\r\nunable to dig out of the Constitution any prohibition of absolute rates.\r\nBut the confusion caused by the raising of the question got the Stetson\r\nbill very much in the air.\r\n\r\nDuring all the discussion, however, the Wright bill was not considered\r\nat all. Nobody was thinking of the Wright bill - that is to say, nobody\r\noutside of those scheming for its passage. Like a mongrel duck's egg\r\nunder a respectable hen, it was left to incubate undisturbed, to\r\nsurprise everybody at the hatching.\r\n\r\nFinding themselves unable to clear away the doubt which raising the\r\nquestion of the constitutionality of the absolute rate had created, the\r\nanti-machine Senators and the attorneys of the shippers finally, after\r\nthe Wright bill had been forced into prominence, put the case something\r\nlike this:\r\n\r\n\"If the Courts decide that the maximum rate only is constitutional, then\r\nthe Wright bill, which provides for the maximum rate, will be\r\nconstitutional, and the greater part of the Stetson bill will also be\r\nconstitutional.\r\n\r\n\"But if the Courts decide that an absolute rate is the only rate\r\njustified under the Constitution, then the Wright bill will be\r\nunconstitutional and all the Stetson bill constitutional.\"\r\n\r\nThis somewhat loose argument unquestionably kept certain Senators who\r\nrecognized the impracticability of the maximum rate, but feared for the\r\nconstitutionality of the absolute rate, in line for the Stetson bill.\r\n\r\nWith the situation thus confused, all was in readiness to bring the\r\nWright bill before the public. This was done on February 17th. Up to\r\nthat date the writer honestly believes that not two minutes had been\r\ndevoted to public discussion of this measure, although the Stetson bill\r\nhad been discussed paragraph by paragraph, line by line, every word\r\nweighed carefully.\r\n\r\nThe ceremony of giving the Wright bill prominence took place behind the\r\nclosed doors of an executive session of the Senate Committee on\r\nCorporations. These executive sessions, by the way, are seldom held when\r\nthe best interests of the public are to be conserved. The proceedings\r\nwere evidently pre-arranged. Senator Wright opened by moving that the\r\npolicy of the Committee should be that the Railroad Regulation measure\r\nto receive favorable consideration from the Committee must provide for\r\nthe maximum rate.\r\n\r\nThe vote was as prompt as it was decisive. Senator Wright's motion\r\ncarried by a vote of 7 to 3. The vote was as follows:\r\n\r\nFor the maximum rate - Bates, Welch, Wright, McCartney, Bills, Finn,\r\nKennedy.\r\n\r\nAgainst the maximum rate - Walker, Roseberry, Miller.\r\n\r\nBurnett, the eleventh member of the Committee, was absent.\r\n\r\nGradually it dawned upon Walker, Miller and Roseberry that this meant\r\nthe favorable recommendation of the Wright bill. The next moment that\r\nfact was hammered into them by the Committee deciding by the same vote,\r\n7 to 3, to recommend that the Stetson bill do not pass; and that the\r\nWright bill do pass.\r\n\r\nThe machine had won the opening skirmish in the railroad regulation\r\ncontroversy. Incidentally it had come out in the open squarely for the\r\nWright bill. From that moment the machine Senators labored openly for\r\nthe passage of the measure. However, the machine was not yet out of the\r\nwoods with its Railroad Regulation bill. The Senate Judiciary Committee\r\nhad still to pass upon it, and the majority of the Judiciary Committee\r\nwas anti-machine.\r\n\r\nWright followed the same course in the Judiciary Committee as he had\r\ntaken in the Committee on Corporations, namely, moved that it be the\r\nsense of the Committee that the Railroad Regulation bill to be favorably\r\nconsidered by the Committee should provide for the maximum rate.\r\n\r\nWright's motion was, however, lost by a vote of 8 to 10. The Committee\r\nnot only rejected the maximum rate, but endorsed the absolute rate, thus\r\nreversing the Committee on Corporations. The vote by which this was done\r\nwas as follows:\r\n\r\nAgainst the maximum rate, against the Wright bill and for the Stetson\r\nbill - Campbell, Cutten, Miller, Stetson, Thompson, Caminetti, Boynton,\r\nRoseberry, Curtin and Cartwright - 10.\r\n\r\nFor the maximum rate, for the Wright bill and against the Stetson bill -\r\nAnthony, Martinelli, McCartney, Wright, Willis, Wolfe, Burnett and\r\nEstudillo - 8.\r\n\r\nAbsent - Savage - 1.\r\n\r\nThus the Stetson bill after two months of machine effort against it,\r\nwent to the floor of the Senate from the Judiciary Committee with the\r\nrecommendation that it \"do pass.\" Of the forty Senators, nineteen were\r\nlawyers, and every one of the nineteen was a member of the Senate\r\nJudiciary Committee. Thus the majority of the lawyers of the Senate, in\r\nspite of the confusion which the machine claquers had created, were\r\nwilling to take their chances on the constitutionality of the Stetson\r\nbill.\r\n\r\nBut in fairness it must be admitted that members of the Judiciary\r\nCommittee who voted for the absolute rate provision of the Stetson bill\r\nwere still in the befuddled condition in which Peter F. Dunne's\r\nsophistry had left them. Senator Miller, for example, in explaining his\r\nvote for the absolute rate, said:\r\n\r\n\"I take this stand, not that I am convinced that the Supreme Court will\r\ndecide the absolute rate to be constitutional; I fear that it may not.\r\nBut the maximum rate is little better than no rate at all. I wish the\r\nabsolute rate provided in this bill, that the Supreme Court may be given\r\nopportunity to pass upon it.\"\r\n\r\nSenator Roseberry, who voted for the absolute rate, confessed himself as\r\nmuch at sea as was Senator Miller. Senator Estudillo, who voted for the\r\nmaximum rate, insisted that he had not been able to make up his mind\r\nwhich should be adopted.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Senator Cutten, himself a lawyer and a close student\r\nof the legal questions involved, stated that while he had thought\r\noriginally that the maximum rate is the only constitutional rate that\r\ncan be fixed, he had been forced to come to the conclusion that the\r\nabsolute rate alone is constitutional.\r\n\r\nBut in the end the Wright bill and not the Stetson bill passed the\r\nSenate. It passed after a day of debate in which the issue became\r\nclouded, if anything, worse than at any stage of the proceedings.\r\nLeavitt and Wolfe, with Wright chipping in with a me-too word now and\r\nthen, led the debate in favor of the Wright bill. Senators Stetson,\r\nBoynton, Cutten, Roseberry and Miller led the fight for the Stetson\r\nbill. Significant enough was the fact that the line-up of Senate leaders\r\nwas precisely the same as that in the fight which the machine carried on\r\nagainst the Direct Primary bill.\r\n\r\nMiller's argument in favor of the Stetson bill showed the confusion\r\nunder which the advocates of effective railroad regulation were\r\nlaboring:\r\n\r\n\"If we adopt the Wright bill,\" said Miller, \"the railroads will be\r\nsatisfied and never dispute it in the Courts. Whereas, by the adoption\r\nof the Stetson bill the railroads will almost be compelled to appeal to\r\nthe Courts, and then we shall have a quick decision on the question in\r\nwhich we are all interested. If the Courts sustain the Stetson bill, we\r\nshall have a law that will do all we want for the present.\"[64]\r\n\r\nThe debate on the measures was on a motion by Stetson that the Stetson\r\nbill be substituted for the Wright bill. In this Stetson made a serious\r\nmistake. He staked his whole bill on one issue, that of absolute or\r\nmaximum rates. On all other points, the Stetson bill was better than the\r\nWright bill. It was a mistake in policy for Stetson to stake the fate of\r\nhis measure on a single issue.\r\n\r\nStetson's motion was lost by a vote of 16 to 22; the Stetson bill was\r\naccordingly not substituted for the Wright bill, and the Wright bill,\r\nwhich had come from the Judiciary Committee with a minority report back\r\nof it, went to third reading and final passage.\r\n\r\nThe vote by which Stetson's motion was defeated, was as follows:\r\n\r\nTo substitute the Stetson bill for the Wright bill - Bell, Birdsall,\r\nBlack, Boynton, Caminetti, Campbell, Cartwright, Curtin, Cutten,\r\nHolohan, Lewis, Miller, Sanford, Stetson, Strobridge, Thompson - 16.\r\n\r\nAgainst substituting the Stetson bill for the Wright bill - Anthony,\r\nBates, Bills, Burnett, Estudillo, Finn, Hare, Hartman, Hurd, Kennedy,\r\nLeavitt, Martinelli, McCartney, Price, Reily, Savage, Walker, Weed,\r\nWelch, Willis, Wolfe, Wright - 22.\r\n\r\nSenators Roseberry and Rush were absent from the room when the vote was\r\ntaken but both were for the Stetson bill, which would have made the vote\r\n22 to 18 in favor of the Wright bill.\r\n\r\nThe twenty Senators whose names are printed in Italics are the twenty\r\nwho voted with Leavitt and Wolfe to maintain the deadlock on the Direct\r\nPrimary bill that the measure might be so amended that the electors of\r\nCalifornia would be denied a practical, State-wide vote for United\r\nStates Senators. But one of the twenty, Lewis, voted for the Stetson\r\nbill, while nineteen of them voted for the Wright bill.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, only three of the Senators, Estudillo, Anthony and\r\nWalker, who stood out for an honest Direct Primary law, voted against\r\nthe Stetson bill and for the Wright bill. Walker had supported the\r\nStetson bill in the Committee on Corporations, but stumbled into the\r\nmachine ranks when it came to final vote. Had the anti-machine had an\r\norganization, such as the machine Democrats and Republicans maintained,\r\nWalker's blunder could have been prevented. Probably, too, Estudillo and\r\nAnthony would have remained with the anti-machine forces[65]. This would\r\nhave given the Stetson bill twenty-one votes, and assured its passage.\r\n\r\nAnother vote that should have been saved to the reformers was that of\r\nBurnett. Burnett was clearly tricked into voting for the Wright bill.\r\nWhen the Stetson bill received the favorable recommendation of the\r\nSenate Judiciary Committee, machine claquers filled the air with the\r\nindefinite promise that in the event of the Wright bill becoming a law,\r\na constitutional amendment would be adopted, by which all ambiguity in\r\nthe State Constitution on the question of maximum and absolute rates\r\nwould be removed. The amendment was then pending before the Senate\r\nJudiciary Committee, which finally reported it favorably.\r\n\r\nAfter the Wright bill had been passed, the amendment was defeated by\r\nmachine votes, as will be shown in the next chapter.\r\n\r\nIn the closing days of the session, when Burnett was urging that steps\r\nbe taken for investigation into the increase of freight rates, he called\r\nattention to the fate of that railroad-regulation amendment.\r\n\r\n\"I was led to vote as I did for the Railroad Regulation bill,\" he said,\r\n\"on the understanding that that constitutional amendment would be\r\nadopted. As you know, it was defeated. My attitude on the regulation\r\nbill would have been very different had I known that the amendment was\r\nto be rejected.\"\r\n\r\nThe Wright bill met with practically no opposition in the Assembly,\r\nbeing rushed through the Lower House in the closing hours of the\r\nsession. Had the Stetson bill passed the Senate, the machine would have\r\ntried to block and amend it in the Assembly as was done with the Direct\r\nPrimary bill, but the measure would probably have been passed.\r\n\r\nHad the anti-machine forces in the Senate been organized, the Stetson,\r\nand not the Wright bill, would have passed that body. Without\r\norganization, or even definite policy, in the face of organized machine\r\nopposition, it is astonishing - and at the same time most encouraging -\r\nthat eighteen of the forty Senators stood by the Stetson bill to the\r\nend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[64] The question to which Senator Miller referred was: Has the\r\nLegislature power under the Constitution to authorize the Railroad\r\nCommissioners to fix the absolute rate? a question upon which the\r\nmachine does not propose the Supreme Court shall be required to pass.\r\n\r\n[65] Walker and Estudillo were bitterly condemned for their vote for the\r\nWright bill. Incidentally, the writer has been roundly criticized for\r\noffering the excuse in their behalf that these two men indicated by\r\ntheir attitude on other measures throughout the session that they would\r\nhave continued with the reform element in the matter of railroad\r\nregulation, had the anti-machine Senators been organized to give\r\neffective resistance to the machine. Perhaps the sanest of this\r\ncriticism, certainly the most reasonable, is from a gentleman who was a\r\nclose observer of the work of the session. He says:\r\n\r\n\"The course of the railroad rate bill from my point of view looked\r\nsomewhat different in many details, at any rate, from your account of\r\nit. I cannot bring myself to think that it was defeated by any chance at\r\nthe hands of a friendly Legislature. I think that what chances there\r\nwere were mostly added to the number of votes the bill got and that the\r\nattitude of men like Walker and Estudillo on that bill was fundamental\r\nand to have been expected from the start. Of course what you say about\r\nthe woeful lack of organization amongst the individual men was only too\r\napparent. That phenomenon reaches back still deeper and is based upon\r\nthe quality of human nature which exerts itself more persistently and\r\nmore energetically and with soldier-like rhythm of compact organization\r\nwhen private selfish interests are involved, than when the general\r\ninterest and somewhat vague uncentered end of public welfare is\r\nconcerned.\"\r\n\r\nBut in spite of this very reasonable view, from a very reasonable\r\ngentleman, the fact remains that in the Committee on Corporations,\r\nWalker stood out against the machine on this very issue, and that in the\r\ndirect primary fight both Walker and Estudillo stood out against the\r\nmachine to the end. Had the anti-machine element been organized, the\r\nStetson bill and not the Wright bill would in all probability have been\r\npassed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIV.\r\n\r\nRailroad Measures.\r\n\r\nConstitutional Amendment to Clear the Way for an Effective Railroad\r\nRegulation Bill Defeated - Rate Investigation Delayed Until Too Late for\r\nEffectiveness - Resolution to Continue Investigation Defeated -\r\nReciprocal Demurrage Bill Becomes a Law - \"Error\" in the Full Crew Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe anti-machine members of the Legislature had not proceeded far in\r\ntheir efforts to pass an effective railroad regulation law, before they\r\nbecame convinced that at best only a make-shift measure is possible,\r\nuntil certain alleged ambiguities of those sections of the State\r\nConstitution prescribing the powers and duties of the State Board of\r\nRailroad Commissioners have been removed. Where, to the common sense\r\nmind, no ambiguities exist, machine claquers and Southern Pacific\r\nattorneys can read them into the Constitution very easily, as in the\r\ndispute as to whether the absolute or the minimum rate is\r\nconstitutional.\r\n\r\nAdvised by the attorneys representing the shipping interests, the\r\nanti-machine members undertook to simplify the language of the sections\r\nin dispute, so that a wayfaring man though a Judge on the bench or a\r\nmachine legislator need not err in the construction thereof.\r\n\r\nEarly in the session, Senator Campbell had introduced a constitutional\r\namendment to that end. The amendment went to the Judiciary Committee on\r\nJanuary 14th. The majority of the committee, openly against the machine,\r\nfavored the submission to the people of such an amendment. But it was\r\nnot until February 22d that the amendment - or rather a substitute for\r\nit - was reported back to the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe day following, February 23d, Senator Campbell had the measure\r\nre-referred to the committee, that an amendment better calculated to\r\nmeet the needs of the State might be prepared. The committee took until\r\nMarch 5th to make its report. The anti-machine Senators on the committee\r\nhad to fight for every inch of the way toward securing a report upon an\r\neffective amendment. This, however, they finally succeeded in doing. The\r\nsecond substitute amendment smoothed out the ambiguities and the alleged\r\nambiguities of the Constitution, of which the machine legislators made\r\nso much during the session, and of which it is feared the courts may\r\nmake much later on. For the long list of constitutional powers and\r\nduties of the Railroad Commissioners, which are so worded as to confuse\r\nthe legal mind, the framers of the amendment substituted the following:\r\n\r\n\"The Commission (Railroad) and each of its members shall have such\r\npowers and perform such duties as are now or may hereafter be provided\r\nfor by law.\" Under that simple permission there could have been no\r\nquestion of the authority of the Legislature to empower the Railroad\r\nCommissioners to fix a system of absolute rates. Section 23, Article\r\nXII., of the Constitution, which at least confused the lawyers employed\r\nby the railroads to prevent the passage of the Stetson bill, was\r\nrepealed entirely. The adoption of the amendment, would, had it been\r\napproved by the people at the general election of 1910, have removed\r\nevery impediment which railroad attorneys claim to be in the way of an\r\neffective railroad regulation law for California.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough the machine Senators who had been so much exercised\r\nover the alleged ambiguities of the Constitution when the Stetson bill\r\nwas under consideration were found opposed to the submission of the\r\namendment to the people. Every Senator who voted against the amendment\r\nhad voted against the Stetson bill and had voted for the Wright bill.\r\nBurnett, who had been led to believe when he voted for the Wright bill\r\nthat the amendment would be submitted to the people, voted for the\r\namendment. Walker also switched back from the machine. Wright and\r\nMcCartney, who had voted against the Stetson bill, also went on record\r\nfor the amendment. The remaining fourteen Senators who voted for it, to\r\na man, had voted for the Stetson bill and against the passage of the\r\nWright bill. But a two-thirds vote of the Senate was required for the\r\namendment's adoption. This meant twenty-seven votes. The amendment was\r\ndefeated, the vote being nineteen for submission of the measure to the\r\npeople, and sixteen against[66].\r\n\r\nThis ended all hope of a model railroad regulation law for California\r\nuntil 1913, for the Constitution must be amended before such a law can\r\nbe realized. If a satisfactory amendment be adopted in 1911, it must\r\nbefore going into effect be ratified by the people. This ratification\r\nwould come in 1912. The Legislature of 1913 would then be able to\r\nproceed with the passage of the model statute.\r\n\r\nAn attempt to investigate the causes and the necessity of the arbitrary\r\nincrease in transcontinental freight rates failed as completely as did\r\nthe attempted amendment of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nEarly in the session, on January 18, to be exact, Senator Caminetti\r\nintroduced a resolution which directed the Senate Committee on Federal\r\nRelations to inquire into the cause of the increase in freight rates,\r\nand to report its findings to the Senate. Two days later Caminetti\r\nintroduced a second and companion resolution, which provided that\r\ninvestigation should be made into the causes for the increase in express\r\ncharges. On Senator Leavitt's motion this last resolution was made a\r\nspecial order for January 22, when the first resolution was to come up.\r\nThe Senate on the 22d re-referred the resolutions back to the committee.\r\n\r\nThe Senate Committee on Federal Relations was, by Caminetti's clever;\r\ntactics in having the resolutions go to that body, forced into a\r\nprominence which evidently worried the machine. It consisted of Burnett,\r\nBlack and Sanford. Black, Republican, and Sanford, Democrat, were\r\nworking openly against the machine. Burnett, while he managed to land on\r\nthe machine side of things at critical points in the progress of the\r\nsession, was by no means a machine coolie. Had it been known that the\r\nCommittee on Federal Relations was to be charged with an investigation\r\ninto railroad affairs, a very different committee would unquestionably\r\nhave been appointed. The machine's problem was to correct the blunder\r\nmade when the anti-machine forces were given a majority on what had\r\nbecome a committee charged with the handling of an important railroad\r\nissue. The ease with which the blunder was corrected speaks volumes for\r\nthe machine's resourcefulness.\r\n\r\nThe air at the capitol suddenly became permeated with the idea that a\r\ncommittee of three was altogether too small to conduct so important an\r\ninvestigation as that proposed in the Caminetti resolutions. Accordingly\r\nthe Committee on Federal Relations very readily recommended, when it\r\nreported the resolutions back to the Senate with the recommendation that\r\nthe investigation be held, that two Senators be added to the committee,\r\nmaking it a committee of five. Had the machine observed the unwritten\r\nrules of Senatorial courtesy[67], which machine Senators insist upon so\r\nloudly, the anti-machine element would have been safe enough in doing\r\nthis. Senatorial courtesy required that the author of the resolutions,\r\nCaminetti, be made one of the two additional members. This would have\r\ngiven the anti-machine element at least three members of the enlarged\r\ncommittee, a condition which did not line with machine purposes at all.\r\nSo Senatorial courtesy was thrown to the winds, Senator Caminetti was\r\nignored, and Senators Wolfe and Bills were named as the additional\r\nmembers of the committee. The machine seldom blunders, but when it does,\r\nusually covers its blunders with astonishing directness and dispatch. A\r\nglance at the records made by Senators Wolfe and Bills, which will be\r\nfound in Table \"A\" of the Appendix, will show the truth of this\r\nstatement.\r\n\r\nThe machine's next move was to delay the investigation. For one reason\r\nand another the investigation was delayed. Finally, on February 19,\r\nCaminetti gave notice that on the following Tuesday, he would move that\r\nthe committee be discharged and a second committee ordered to carry out\r\nthe instructions contained in the resolutions. This declaration of war\r\nstirred the machine to action - machine action. Assurances were given\r\nthat the investigation would be held, but it was March 12, almost two\r\nmonths after the resolution had been introduced, and only twelve days\r\nbefore adjournment, before the committee placed its first witness on the\r\nstand.\r\n\r\nAt that time the Senate was in the midst of the Direct Primary fight,\r\nand in addition, the machine after months of planning was sending\r\nliterally hundreds of measures into Senate and Assembly for final\r\naction. There was no time nor were the members of the committee in a\r\ncondition to conduct the investigation which the anti-machine element\r\nhad contemplated. But hurried hearings were held, and a mass of evidence\r\nof railroad and express company extortion brought into the open. The\r\ninterested reader will find the testimony printed in the Senate journal\r\nof March 23, 1909.\r\n\r\nMen of the standing of Edwin Bonnheim[68], treasurer and manager of\r\nWeinstock, Lubin & Co.; Russell D. Carpenter, auditor of Hale Brothers,\r\nInc.; J. O. Bracken, manager of the California Commercial Association;\r\nC. H. Bentley of the California Fruit Canners Association; all testified\r\nthat the increase in express and freight charges has worked great\r\nhardship upon the State. They showed that in the final analysis the\r\nconsumer pays the increased charges. Furthermore, testimony was produced\r\nwhich at least indicated that the transportation companies, if\r\neconomically not to say honestly managed, would receive fair returns on\r\ntheir legitimate investments, were even lower freight rates to be\r\ncharged than those exacted prior to the increase of 1908. It was also\r\nshown that the State of California could institute and conduct an\r\nexamination into railroad affairs before the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission[69]. It was clear to all that thorough investigation under\r\nthe Caminetti resolutions would prove of enormous benefit to the State.\r\nThat the committee could do little or nothing in the short time\r\nremaining before adjournment was also recognized. Burnett had come out\r\nfor thorough investigation, giving the anti-machine forces a majority of\r\nthe committee. Witness after witness representing the large shippers and\r\nimporters of the State urged that the investigation be carried on even\r\nafter the Legislature had adjourned. Burnett as chairman of the\r\ncommittee was urging this course, but it was March 23, the day before\r\nadjournment, before he could get his committee report ready, and filed\r\nwith the Senate, as basis for a resolution to continue the investigation\r\nafter the Legislature had adjourned. There were but eleven dependable\r\nanti-machine Senators in addition to Burnett who were within reach of\r\nthe capitol. But the machine had a safe majority within call. Burnett's\r\nresolution was defeated, the investigation denied, by a vote of twelve\r\nfor to sixteen against[70].\r\n\r\nBut two important railroad measures were finally passed by the\r\nLegislature. The first of these was the \"Full Crew bill,\" which required\r\nadequate manning of railroad trains. After being held-up as long as the\r\nmachine dared, the bill was finally passed. But the \"Full Crew bill\" met\r\nwith one of those unfortunate \"errors\"[71] which played such important\r\nparts in the passage of the Anti-Gambling bill and the Direct Primary\r\nbill. When the Legislature had adjourned this error was discovered, and\r\nGovernor Gillett refused to sign the bill because of it.\r\n\r\nThe second important railroad measure passed was the Reciprocal\r\nDemurrage bill, introduced in the Senate by Miller, and in the Assembly\r\nby Drew. As finally passed the bill provides that railroad companies\r\nwhich fail to supply shippers with cars when proper requisition has been\r\nmade for them, shall pay the injured shipper demurrage at the rate of $5\r\nper car per day. On the other hand, shippers who fail to load or unload\r\ncars after a stated time, are required to pay the railroad $6 daily as\r\ndemurrage. The extra dollar which the shippers are required to pay the\r\nrailroads is exacted to compensate the railroads for rental of the car.\r\n\r\nSimilar laws up to the time of the passage of the Miller-Drew bill had\r\nbeen adopted by seventeen States of the Union, including Oregon and\r\nTexas. During the recent car shortage, it is alleged that empty cars\r\nneeded in California, were sent into Oregon and into Texas, that the\r\nrailroads might escape the demurrage charges exacted in those two\r\nStates. California, without a demurrage law, was helpless. At the\r\nsession of 1907, however, the machine, in complete control of the\r\nSenate, defeated a reciprocal demurrage bill. To be sure the demurrage\r\nwas higher in the measure proposed in 1907 than in that passed at the\r\nsession of 1909, but it was the principle of demurrage, not its amount,\r\nthat the machine was against in 1907. In 1909, however, not a Senator\r\nvoted against the bill. And in this connection there is a story told\r\nwhich unquestionably had its bearing upon the fate of the Reciprocal\r\nDemurrage bill at the 1909 session. The story deals with a political\r\nadventure in the life of one Henry Lynch.\r\n\r\nMr. Lynch voted against reciprocal demurrage in 1907. He voted neither\r\nfor nor against reciprocal demurrage in 1909, for he was not at\r\nSacramento to vote. Mr. Lynch was not at Sacramento to vote in 1909, for\r\none reason at least, because he did vote against reciprocal demurrage in\r\n1907.\r\n\r\nMr. Lynch hailed from the Thirty-first Senatorial District, which takes\r\nin San Benito and San Luis Obispo counties. These counties are intensely\r\nRepublican; they are also farming communities. And since the one-time\r\nSenator Lynch voted against the Reciprocal Demurrage bill, the farmers\r\nhave seen tons upon tons of their products rot in the fields because\r\nthey could not get cars to move their crops.\r\n\r\nBut while the farmers of San Luis Obispo and San Benito counties were\r\nwatching their products rot for want of cars to move them, it is alleged\r\nthat cars were being sent from California to Oregon to meet the\r\nrequisitions of Oregon shippers. Oregon had a reciprocal demurrage law\r\non her statute books; California had not.\r\n\r\nSenator Lynch's vote against the Reciprocal Demurrage bill was made a\r\nsort of issue in San Benito and San Luis Obispo counties at the election\r\nof 1908. A. E. Campbell, Democrat, was running against Mr. Lynch,\r\nRepublican, for the State Senate. Right or wrong - the reader may judge\r\nwhich - the farmers of the two counties credited the defeat of the\r\nReciprocal Demurrage bill not to the Republican Party, but to the\r\nRepublican machine, or better described perhaps as the\r\nRepublican-Democratic machine, that dominates the State, a machine\r\nwhich the people of California are just now engaged in smashing.\r\n\r\nBeing good Republicans, the people of Mr. Lynch's district gave Mr. Taft\r\na plurality of more than 1,700; remembering the defeat of the Reciprocal\r\nDemurrage bill, they gave Mr. Campbell, Democratic candidate for the\r\nSenate, a plurality of 416. The fact that a United States Senator was to\r\nbe elected didn't influence the Republicans of San Luis Obispo County at\r\nall. They elected a Democrat to the State Senate because they knew him\r\nto be free from machine domination - a machine maintained for the\r\npurpose of defeating good measures, such as the Reciprocal Demurrage\r\nbill, and furthering the passage of bad ones.\r\n\r\nBut the influence of Lynch's vote against the Reciprocal Demurrage bill\r\nwas not confined to San Luis Obispo and San Benito Counties. It spread\r\nover into the adjoining Twenty-ninth District, which takes in Santa Cruz\r\nand San Mateo Counties. These counties are also intensely Republican.\r\nThey gave Taft a plurality of 2,799. But they gave the Democratic\r\ncandidate for the State Senate, James B. Holohan, a plurality of 677.\r\nHolohan ran 3,476 votes ahead of his ticket in a district where only\r\n9,483 votes were cast for State Senator. Holohan was known to be free of\r\nmachine influences. He could be counted upon to vote for a Reciprocal\r\nDemurrage bill without first consulting the Southern Pacific's political\r\nagent, Jere Burke. And the Republican whose place he took in the Senate\r\nhad voted against the Reciprocal Demurrage bill of 1907.\r\n\r\nThe election of Holohan and Campbell unquestionably had its influence on\r\nthe passage of the Demurrage, bill. Not a member of the Senate cast his\r\nvote against it, although several of the Senators who had voted against\r\nthe bill two years before, sat in the Senate of 1909. Among these were\r\nten Senators who, during the session of 1909, were conspicuously on the\r\nwrong side of most questions. They were Senators Bates, Hartman,\r\nLeavitt, McCartney, Reily, Savage, Weed, Willis, Wolfe and Wright. The\r\nten, for example, constituted half the twenty Senators who opposed the\r\nplan to give The People State-wide popular vote in the selection of\r\nUnited States Senators. Only seven Senators voted against the\r\nAnti-Racetrack Gambling bill. Five of the seven - Hartman, Leavitt,\r\nReily, Weed and Wolfe - had voted against reciprocal demurrage in 1907.\r\nBut there was a harkening to the demand of The People in 1909, which had\r\nbeen wanting two years before. Seven of these ten Senators, who voted\r\nagainst reciprocal demurrage in 1907 - Bates, Hartman, McCartney,\r\nSavage, Willis, Wolfe and Wright - voted for reciprocal demurrage in\r\n1909. Three of them - Leavitt, Reily and Weed - did not vote at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[66] The vote was as follows:\r\n\r\nFor the amendment: Bell, Birdsall, Boynton, Burnett, Caminetti,\r\nCampbell, Cartwright, Curtin, Cutten, Holohan, McCartney, Miller,\r\nRoseberry, Rush, Strobridge, Sanford, Thompson, Walker, Wright - 19.\r\n\r\nAgainst the amendment: Anthony, Bills, Estudillo, Finn, Hartman, Hurd,\r\nKennedy, Leavitt, Lewis, Price, Reily, Savage, Weed, Welch, Willis,\r\nWolfe - 16.\r\n\r\n[67] Machine Senators habitually exact the utmost consideration and\r\ncourtesy from the anti-machine Senators, and habitually repay it with\r\ndeceit and trickery. The curious feature of this is that the\r\nanti-machine Senators continue to extend the courtesy and continue to be\r\ntricked and imposed upon. A shutting off of \"Senatorial courtesy\" would\r\ngo far toward solving the problem of machine domination of the\r\nLegislature.\r\n\r\n[68] Mr. Bonnheim testified that prior to the new schedule of express\r\nrates enforced between New York and the city of San Francisco, the rate\r\nwas $8.00 per hundred for shipments of from 10,000 to 20,000 pounds;\r\n$9.00 per hundred for 5,000 to 10,000 pounds; $10.00 per hundred for\r\n2,000 to 5,000 pounds; $11.00 per hundred from 1,000 to 2,000 pounds.\r\nand $12.00 from 500 to 1,000 pounds; $13.50 from 100 to 500 pounds.\r\n\r\nThat the withdrawal of the bulk rates in December, 1908, resulted in an\r\nadvance of 35 per cent by the withdrawal of the 2,000 pound rate, and an\r\nadvance of 50 per cent by the withdrawal of the 5,000 pound rate; an\r\nadvance of 66 3/4 per cent by the withdrawal of the 10,000 pound rate,\r\nand that the withdrawal of the 20,000 pound rate amounted to an advance\r\nof 92 8/10 per cent.\r\n\r\n[69] Senator Cartwright actually introduced a resolution calling upon\r\nthe Attorney-General to institute proceedings before the Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission:\r\n\r\nTo determine whether existing rates are reasonable or unreasonable.\r\n\r\nTo ascertain, fix and establish a reasonable schedule of freight rates,\r\nand to enforce the same.\r\n\r\nTo determine whether or not any existing rate is discriminatory.\r\n\r\nAnd to prevent further discrimination between persons or places.\r\n\r\nThe resolution carried an appropriation of $25,000 to ensure competent\r\nlegal and expert assistance.\r\n\r\nThe resolution was introduced on February 4. It went first to the\r\nCommittee on Federal Relations, then to the Judiciary Committee, then to\r\nthe Committee on Finance, from which it emerged March 1 with the\r\nrecommendation that it be adopted. On March 2 it was sent back to the\r\nCommittee on Finance and was never heard from again. The enormous\r\nbenefit to the State if such an investigation could be honestly and\r\neffectively carried on, will be recognized.\r\n\r\n[70] The vote was as follows:\r\n\r\nFor the resolution: Bell, Birdsall, Boynton, Burnett, Caminetti, Cutten,\r\nEstudillo, Holohan, Roseberry, Rush, Sanford, Thompson - 12.\r\n\r\nAgainst the resolution: Anthony, Bates, Bills, Finn, Hartman, Hurd,\r\nKennedy, Leavitt, Lewis, Martinelli, Reily, Savage, Weed, Willis, Wolfe,\r\nWright - 16.\r\n\r\n[71] E. F. Mitchell, Executive Secretary to Governor Gillett, makes the\r\nfollowing statement regarding this particular error:\r\n\r\nThe electric companies which run interurban trains, also claimed that\r\nthe bill, as prepared, applied to them, and would place upon them an\r\nunnecessary burden and expense.\r\n\r\n\"There is no doubt that section three of the act applies to motor cars\r\nand electric cars. The language is very plain. Section one of the bill\r\ndescribes passenger trains, section two refers to freight trains, and\r\nsection three says \"all other trains not propelled by steam\r\nlocomotives.\" Now, there are only two classes of cars that are not\r\npropelled by steam locomotives, and those are motor and electric cars.\r\nIn the Governor's opinion, an error was made in endeavoring to amend it,\r\nso it would not apply to motor cars and electric cars. The amendment was\r\nprepared, and we had here in the office, during the argument on the\r\nbill, the original committee amendments proposed. The amendment was to\r\nbe made after the word \"train\" on the second line and had this amendment\r\nbeen made as contemplated, it would have excluded motor cars and\r\nelectric cars, but instead of having been made on line two, as expected,\r\nit was carried into line three, where it gave the bill an entirely\r\ndifferent meaning, It was one of those unfortunate things that crept\r\ninto legislation through an oversight of somebody, which could have been\r\nreadily corrected if the bill had been watched. The insertion of this\r\namendment in the wrong place, instead of excluding motor cars and\r\nelectric cars, as intended, included them. This error was not discovered\r\nuntil the bill came up before the Governor for consideration.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XV.\r\n\r\nDefeat of the Commonwealth Club Bills.\r\n\r\nDrawn By Committees of the Ablest San Francisco Attorneys Not Under\r\nRetainer of Prison-Dodging Captains of Industry - Measures Not Allowed\r\nto Reach Senate or Assembly, but Killed in Committees - Grove L.\r\nJohnson's Keen Opposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe graft prosecution at San Francisco not only brought the fact\r\nsquarely before the public that large corporations sometimes catch the\r\neasiest way to achieve their purposes by bribing public officials, but\r\nthat it is a deal easier to pass a camel through the eye of a needle\r\nthan a millionaire offender through the legal cobwebs of technicality to\r\na cell at San Quentin or Folsom[72].\r\n\r\nThat the technical defense in criminal cases was subject to grave abuses\r\nhad been generally recognized. But it took the graft cases at San\r\nFrancisco to fairly rub this unpleasant fact into the law-abiding\r\nelement. Because for the first time in the practice of criminal law in\r\nCalifornia, unlimited wealth was available to employ the best legal\r\ntalent to defend men under indictment.\r\n\r\nThe defending lawyers took advantage of every technicality. They\r\nemphasized the most trivial of them. Gradually it began to dawn upon The\r\nPeople that here were legal refuges, based upon the most absurd of\r\ntechnicalities, the sweeping away of which would in no way injure the\r\nsubstantial rights of a person charged with crime, refuges which were\r\navailable to the rich man but denied to the poor or moderately\r\nwell-to-do.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, any person accused could make his technical defense if he\r\nhad the means to employ the necessary counsel. But in face of the\r\nastonishing performances going on in the courts at San Francisco, it\r\nsoon became apparent to the thoughtful, that no man, whose fortune was\r\nexpressed in terms of less than five ciphers could make such a defense.\r\n\r\nThus the unpalatable truth was forced home, that we have in California a\r\ntechnical defense available for the rich man charged with crime, which\r\nis in effect denied even those of the so-called middle classes.\r\n\r\nWith this conviction came demand of reform of the criminal laws to\r\nensure:\r\n\r\n(1) A prompt trial of an accused person on the merits of the case.\r\n\r\n(2) A prompt judgment in the case of a verdict of guilty.\r\n\r\n(3) A prompt hearing of the case in the Court of Appeal.\r\n\r\nThe machine was, of course, against any such \"wicked innovations,\" as\r\nAssemblyman Grove L. Johnson would have called them.\r\n\r\nHowever, at San Francisco, three considerable bodies, the Bar\r\nAssociation, the Commonwealth Club and the Citizens' League of Justice,\r\ntook the matter up, and for months had the ablest lawyers of the State -\r\nat any rate the ablest not retained for the defense of capitalists under\r\nindictment - at work wrestling with the problem of simplifying the\r\ncriminal codes and doing away so far as possible with technical defense,\r\nexcept in such cases as the substantial rights of the defendant might be\r\ninvolved.\r\n\r\nA committee consisting of J. C. McKinstry, J. J. Dwyer, Lester H.\r\nJacobs, Oscar Cushing and Warren Olney Jr. was appointed for this\r\npurpose by the Citizens' League of Justice. The Commonwealth Club\r\nappointed Beverly L. Hodghead, Orrin K. McMurray, Alex. G. Eells,\r\nFairfax H. Wheelan, Sidney V. Smith, Lester H. Jacobs and Joseph\r\nHutchinson. One would go far before finding more representative or more\r\npublic-spirited bodies of citizens, or more able exponents of the law.\r\n\r\nThe labors of the several committees resulted in what may in a broad way\r\nbe regarded as two sets of bills being prepared.\r\n\r\nThe first, known as the Commonwealth Club bills, were sixty-five in\r\nnumber, and were introduced in the Senate by Campbell, and in the\r\nAssembly by Butler. The second set was known as the Bar Association\r\nbills. They were introduced in the Senate by Burnett. They were nine in\r\nnumber, and while apparently covering much of the ground of the\r\nCommonwealth Club bills, were in no respects so complete as to method or\r\ndetail. The Bar Association bills pin-pricked an abuse; the Commonwealth\r\nClub bills drove the knife in deep.\r\n\r\nThe sixty-five Commonwealth Club bills were readily divided into three\r\ngroups, those dealing with Grand Juries and indictments, with trial\r\njuries and verdicts, and with appeals to the higher courts.\r\n\r\nThe general purpose of the measures dealing with Grand Juries was to\r\nmake those bodies purely accusatory, to make their findings conclusive\r\nand not subject to attack. The basis of the proposed amendments and\r\nadditions to the laws governing Grand Juries was that Grand Juries are\r\nprimarily required to investigate secret offenses, and should be\r\nregarded as purely accusatory bodies. On this theory the Commonwealth\r\nClub bills made the indictment of a Grand Jury as binding as the action\r\nof a committing magistrate who holds a defendant to answer. Had the\r\nCommonwealth Club bills become laws there would have been no more\r\nplacing of Grand Jurors on trial for having found indictments against\r\npersons able to employ crafty criminal lawyers.\r\n\r\nBut lest the defendant under investigation might be wronged, the\r\nCommonwealth Club measures so amended the codes that a Grand Juror in\r\nany way biased against the defendant was required to absent himself from\r\nthe Grand Jury room when the defendant's case was under consideration.\r\nUnder the proposed laws each Grand Juror was required to take oath \"not\r\nto participate in the inquiry as to any matter or affecting any person\r\nas to which or whom he is biased or could not vote freely either way\r\nthat the evidence presented would in justice require him to vote.\"\r\n\r\nThe Commonwealth Club amendments regarding trial juries dealt with the\r\nproblem in the same broad spirit. The chief object sought was to avoid\r\nthe trying of citizens called for jury service[73]. The proposed laws\r\nobviated this by leaving it with the Judge to determine the\r\nqualifications of the juror, that is to say, the examination of jurors\r\nin criminal cases was to have been taken out of the hands of the lawyers\r\nand required of the Judge. To compensate the defendant for whatever\r\nsubstantial disadvantage he might suffer, the number of his peremptory\r\nchallenges was materially increased.\r\n\r\nTo prevent the setting aside of judgments on trifling technicalities,\r\nthe proposed amendments provided that the Judge should fix the legality\r\nof the jury panel by general order, after which challenges could not\r\napply to the whole panel, although they still held as to individual\r\njurors.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important of the provisions regarding trial jurors was\r\nthat the reading of mere newspaper reports of a case should not\r\ndisqualify a trial juror, unless it were shown that the newspaper\r\narticle purported to be a true copy of the official testimony.\r\n\r\nThe fact that under the present law the term \"reasonable doubt\" is not\r\ngiven legal definition paves the way for frequent miscarriages of\r\njustice. The Judge is required to define the term for the jury. The\r\ndefendant may take exception to the definition, thus paving the way for\r\ntechnical defense in the upper Courts. The Commonwealth Club bills\r\ndefined \"reasonable doubt\" to be, \"that state of the case which, after\r\nthe entire comparison and consideration of all the evidence in the\r\ncause, leaves the minds of the jurors in that condition that they cannot\r\nsay they feel an abiding conviction to a moral certainty of the truth of\r\nthe charge.\"\r\n\r\nAmendments were also proposed to the law governing instructions to\r\njuries. Under the present rule, each side presents a long list of\r\ninstructions for the Judge to give to the jury. If the Judge refuse to\r\ngive the instructions as requested, objections to his refusal can be\r\ntaken and made basis for a technical defense[73a]. Under the proposed\r\namendments objection could be made only to such instructions as were\r\ngiven, not to those which were not presented to the jury.\r\n\r\nIn none of those proposed amendments could the substantial rights of the\r\ndefendant be said to be encroached upon. But the proposed laws did clear\r\naway a mass of technicalities which has kept many a scamp out of jail.\r\n\r\nThe proposed amendments dealing with appeals in criminal cases aimed at\r\nprompt judgment and sentence after conviction, prompt appeal and\r\nconclusion of the case.\r\n\r\nTo this end, the measures provided that upon conviction the defendant\r\nmust be sentenced forthwith, and if appeals were taken, taken on the\r\njudgment. Instead of the cumbersome bill of exceptions, which required\r\nweeks and sometimes months to prepare, it was provided that the entire\r\ntestimony given at the trial, together with the complete minutes of the\r\nproceedings, should be sent to the higher tribunal. This would place\r\nbefore the Appellate and Supreme Courts all the facts and testimony\r\nwhich the Lower Court had considered. This feature of the Commonwealth\r\nClub bills was also covered by the measures which had been prepared by\r\nthe Bar Association.\r\n\r\nUnder the proposed Commonwealth Club amendments, the defendant was not\r\npermitted to appeal on questions referring to the trial jury panels or\r\nthe Grand jury, nor on any error not affecting his substantial rights.\r\nError in an immaterial issue, or of not sufficient importance to affect\r\nthe substantial rights of the defendant, was not, under the provisions\r\nof the Commonwealth Club bills, to be held ground for reversal.\r\n\r\n\"We believe,\" said the Committee which drew up the Commonwealth Club\r\nbills, \"that what we have proposed is in no way revolutionary and\r\ndeprives the accused person of no substantial right. The amendments\r\nproposed are merely designed to make the present law more effective, to\r\nrelieve the Courts from the necessity of considering trivial matters and\r\nto aid in determining more promptly whether a person accused of crime is\r\ninnocent or guilty.\"\r\n\r\nThe bills as introduced in the Assembly were referred to the Assembly\r\nJudiciary Committee. In the Senate, the bills went to the Senate\r\nJudiciary Committee.\r\n\r\nThe promoters of the Commonwealth Club bills made the mistake of\r\ntreating the machine Senators and Assemblymen as men who could be won\r\nover with reason and plain statement. Instead of fighting for their\r\nbills and demanding their passage, the agents of the club were willing\r\nto listen courteously to suggestions from tricksters intent upon the\r\ndefeat of the measures, who were only playing for time.\r\n\r\nCarroll Cook was at Sacramento lobbying against the bills, as were\r\nothers of that gentleman's view of affairs. Cook actually appeared\r\nbefore the Assembly Judiciary Committee on invitation of one of its\r\nmembers. The courtesy shown him by Grove L. Johnson, chairman of the\r\nCommittee, was touching or nauseating, as one might view it. Johnson,\r\nwho was in effect the Committee, took occasion on the day of Cook's\r\nappearance to denounce the measures as revolutionary, unconstitutional,\r\nvicious.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that sixty-three of the sixty-five bills as\r\nintroduced in the Assembly never got beyond Johnson's Committee. They\r\ndied right there. The two exceptions got out of the Committee in the\r\nclosing days of the session, one on March 10th, the other on March 20th.\r\nThey were reported out with the recommendation that they do pass. It was\r\nthen too late to take any action on them. They died on the Assembly\r\nfile.\r\n\r\nThose who were making a fight for the measures were kept running between\r\nthe Judiciary Committee of the Assembly and that of the Senate. The\r\nSenate Committee, while a majority of its members were against the\r\nmachine, was led by men who were not at all in sympathy with any plan\r\nthat was calculated to clear away legal cobwebs. On the pretext that the\r\nreforms proposed were covered by the Bar Association bills, or that the\r\nmeasures were duplicated by other bills, or that they were loosely\r\ndrawn, on any pretext, in fact, the Senate Committee recommended that\r\nfifty-two of the sixty-five measures be withdrawn. And they were\r\nwithdrawn. Of the thirteen remaining, seven stuck in the Committee, died\r\nthere; five, just before the session closed, were referred back to the\r\nSenate with the recommendation that they do not pass. They didn't. Of\r\nthe sixty-five bills, the Senate Committee gave only one favorable\r\nrecommendation. This lone recipient of Committee approval got back to\r\nthe Senate on March 5th. It died on the files.\r\n\r\nSuch was the fate of the measures prepared under the direction of the\r\nCommonwealth Club for reform of the methods of indictment, trial and\r\nappeal in criminal cases. The Bar Association bills received somewhat\r\nbetter treatment.\r\n\r\nOf the nine so-called Bar Association bills, eight passed the Senate;\r\nthe other died in the Senate Judiciary Committee. Of the eight which got\r\nthrough the Senate, two were defeated in the Assembly, while six passed\r\nthat body and went to the Governor.\r\n\r\nFour of the six Bar Association bills which passed dealt with the repeal\r\nof those sections of the code which provide for bills of exceptions in\r\ncriminal cases and substituted the plan, described in considering the\r\nCommonwealth Club bills, of providing the higher Court with complete\r\nrecord of the testimony and the proceedings in the trial Court.\r\n\r\nOne of the two remaining measures requires sentence to be imposed upon a\r\nconvicted felon in not less than two nor more than five days after the\r\nverdict or plea of guilty, with the right reserved for the Court of\r\nextending the time to ten days. The sixth measure defines \"a motion in\r\narrest of judgment.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the outcome of the effort made by reputable lawyers and public\r\nspirited laymen to eliminate quackery from the practice of the criminal\r\nlaw. But measures calculated to make the practice of the criminal law\r\neven more involved and technical than it is were granted more\r\nconsideration. Many of them passed both houses. How they were passed and\r\nwhat they are will be considered in another chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[72] No sooner had the indictments been returned in the San Francisco\r\ncases than the validity of the indicting Grand Jury was attacked. For\r\nmonths that issue occupied the attention of the Courts. One by one the\r\nmembers of the Grand Jury were dragged into Court, and in effect placed\r\non trial that technical disqualification if such existed might be\r\nestablished. The greater part of a day was, for example, consumed in\r\nthrashing over the question whether one or three motions had been made\r\nin nominating the stenographer to the Grand Jury.\r\n\r\nThen came appeals to the higher Courts which occupied more months and\r\nall but endless labor and expense.\r\n\r\nWhen the attacks on the Grand Jury had been met and disposed of, and the\r\ndefendants brought to the trial Court, the Prosecution found its labors\r\nscarcely begun. Every trial juror was placed on trial. Weeks and even\r\nmonths were required, because of technical objections, to secure a trial\r\njury.\r\n\r\nJust before the Legislature convened, Abe Ruef, had, as example, been\r\nconvicted by a jury in the securing of which the metropolis of the State\r\nhad been raked as with a fine-tooth comb for talesmen who were not\r\ntechnically disqualified to serve. Thousands were available who would\r\nhave given the defendant a fair trial, but in all San Francisco very few\r\ncould be found who were not because of one technical reason or another\r\ndisqualified.\r\n\r\nAfter conviction came the defendant's appeal, in which the Most trivial\r\nreasons were accepted for freeing the defendant whose technical defense\r\nhad failed him in the lower Courts. Former Mayor Schmitz of San\r\nFrancisco, after conviction of extortion, and Abe Ruef, after having\r\npleaded guilty to the charge, were given their freedom under\r\ncircumstances which, to put it mildly, shocked the whole State.\r\n\r\n[73] A prominent San Francisco attorney told the writer recently that\r\n\"the criminal lawyer too often questions a talesman needlessly, not so\r\nmuch to disqualify him, as to get technical error into the record.\"\r\n\r\n[73a] It was on a technicality of this kind that the District Court of\r\nAppeals found excuse for reversal of the judgment in the case of Louis\r\nGlass, convicted of bribing a member of the San Francisco Board of\r\nSupervisors. E. J. Zimmer, the auditor of the Pacific States Telephone\r\nCompany, of which Glass was an official, refused to testify at Glass'\r\ntrial. The trial court refused to instruct the jury to disregard the\r\nrefusal. The Appellate Court held this to be a fatal error.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVI.\r\n\r\nHow the Change of Venue Bill Was Passed.\r\n\r\nSlipped Through the Assembly Without Serious Opposition in Closing Days\r\nof the Session - Passed by Trick in the Senate Although a Majority of\r\nThat Body Were Opposed to Its Passage - Typical Case of Machine\r\n\"Generalship.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiven the presiding officers of the Senate and Assembly and the\r\nappointment of the Committees of both bodies, the machine minority in\r\nthe Legislature had comparatively little difficulty in preventing the\r\npassage of desirable measures. Thus, the Commonwealth Club bills to\r\nsimplify and expedite proceedings in criminal cases, or, if you like, to\r\nprevent quackery in the practice of the criminal law, were, by clever\r\nmanipulation, defeated, although if fairly presented to Senate and\r\nAssembly they undoubtedly would have become laws[74].\r\n\r\nBut when it came to passing vicious measures in the face of the\r\nopposition of the unorganized majority of both Houses, the machine had a\r\nharder job on its hands. A majority vote of each House is required for\r\nthe passage of a measure. To get through its bills, then, the machine\r\nhad to create a situation in which vicious measures could be rushed\r\nthrough without the unorganized reformers knowing what was being done.\r\nBy preventing action on a large majority of the measures pending before\r\nthe Legislature until the end of the session, such a situation was\r\ncreated. In the confusion of the closing days of the session, not only\r\nwere good bills denied passage, but vicious bills, in spite of the\r\nopposition of a majority of the Legislature, were passed. Some normally\r\nanti-machine members in such a situation become worn out, get\r\ndiscouraged and vote for machine policies to secure machine support for\r\nmeasures, the passage of which their constituents at home are demanding.\r\nOthers, in the confusion of a whirlwind close of the session, vote for\r\nmeasures which they have no time to read, and which they cannot\r\nunderstand. Thus, even with a majority of Senate and Assembly against\r\nmachine policies, the clever machine leaders often slip through measures\r\nwhich could not be passed early in the session, when the members have\r\nopportunity to study the bills upon which they are called upon to act,\r\nand before the ranks of the reform element have been broken.\r\n\r\nThis was very well illustrated at the Session of 1909 by the passage of\r\nthe so-called Change of Venue bill[74a]. This measure was introduced in\r\nthe Assembly by Grove L. Johnson. Under its provisions a person charged\r\nwith crime would have been permitted upon his whim or caprice to allege\r\nbias and disqualify the Judge before whom he was to be tried. The\r\nLegislature of 1907 was admittedly controlled by the machine, but even\r\nthe Legislature of 1907 did not dare pass the Change of Venue bill. The\r\nreform Legislature of 1909, however, did pass it. The manner in which it\r\nwas passed is a lesson in machine methods. To the credit of Governor\r\nGillett let it be said, however, that he vetoed the measure[75].\r\n\r\nGrove L. Johnson having introduced the bill, it was referred to\r\nJohnson's committee, the Judiciary Committee of the Assembly. The\r\nCommittee held it until February 5, when it was referred back to the\r\nAssembly with the recommendation that it \"do pass.\" On March 13, eleven\r\ndays before adjournment, it passed the Assembly, by a vote of 42 to 15,\r\n41 votes being required for its passage. Assemblymen like Drew, Telfer,\r\nWilson and Stuckenbruck, men who fought the machine and machine policies\r\nfrom the beginning to the end of the session, voted for the bill. The\r\nnegative vote of any two of them would have defeated it[76].\r\n\r\nThe passage in the Assembly of an important reform measure as late as\r\nMarch 13, would have meant its defeat in the Senate. Though in the\r\nmajority the anti-machine Senators could not have forced a reform\r\nmeasure through the machine-controlled committees, machine-controlled\r\neven when a majority of a committee was anti-machine[77]. Measures of\r\nthe Change of Venue bill stamp, however, had a clear way. The Change of\r\nVenue bill was on March 15 referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee.\r\nOn March 16, twenty-four hours after, the Committee returned the bill\r\nwith the recommendation that it do pass. On March 19, with twenty-two\r\nSenators opposed to its passage, and eighteen favoring it, with\r\ntwenty-one votes necessary for its passage, the bill passed the Senate.\r\nThis apparently impossible feat was, in the last two weeks of the\r\nsession, a comparatively easy task for the machine.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, Senator Black, who opposed the bill, was ill at his home\r\nat Palo Alto. This left twenty-one Senators against the measure and\r\neighteen for. The line-up was as follows:\r\n\r\nFor the Change of Venue bill - Anthony, Bates, Bills, Finn, Hare,\r\nHartman, Hurd, Leavitt, Martinelli, McCartney, Price, Reily, Savage,\r\nWeed, Welch, Willis, Wolfe, Wright - 18.\r\n\r\nAgainst the Change of Venue bill - Bell, Birdsall, Boynton,\r\nBurnett[76a], Caminetti, Campbell, Cartwright, Curtin, Cutten,\r\nEstudillo, Holohan, Lewis, Kennedy, Miller, Roseberry, Rush, Sanford,\r\nStetson, Strobridge, Thompson, Walker - 21.\r\n\r\nOn the face of it, the outlook for the passage of the Change of Venue\r\nbill in the Senate was not good. The machine, however, planned to pass\r\nthe bill on March 19.\r\n\r\nThe machine leaders went at the job systematically. When the Senators\r\ntook their seats that Friday morning, they found that at Senator Bates'\r\nrequest, Assembly Bill 6 (the Change of Venue bill) had been put on the\r\nSpecial Urgency File. The Special Urgency File was to be considered at 8\r\no'clock Friday evening. Senator Bates stated in an interview that he had\r\nplaced Assembly Bill No. 6 on the Special Urgency File \"at the request\r\nof a fellow Senator.\" Who the fellow Senator was, Bates refused to say.\r\nBates insisted, however, that he knew nothing about Assembly Bill No, 6,\r\nand could give no reason why it should be made a matter of \"special\r\nurgency.\" Senator Bates has since the Legislature adjourned been given a\r\nposition of trust in the United States Mint.\r\n\r\nWith the Change of Venue bill on the Special Urgency File, the next step\r\nwas to get it considered at the moment most favorable for machine\r\npurposes. Along about 11 o'clock in the forenoon - the reader should\r\nkeep in mind that in the ordinary course of the Senate's work the\r\nSpecial Urgency File would not have been considered until 8 o'clock that\r\nevening - Senator Wolfe moved that the Special Urgency File be taken up\r\nout of order. But before the Change of Venue bill could be reached,\r\nSenator Wright, who favored the passage of the measure, was found to be\r\nabsent from the Senate chamber. On Senator McCartney's motion, the\r\nChange of Venue bill was temporarily passed on file. With the constant\r\ncoming and going of Senators, there was no time while the file was under\r\nconsideration, that the eighteen Senators counted on to vote in a solid\r\nblock for the bill, were all present. The Senate concluded consideration\r\nof the Special Urgency File, and still the Change of Venue bill had not\r\nbeen taken up. The Senate then took up the second reading of Assembly\r\nbills, and then the Special File of Appropriation bills. A communication\r\nfrom Dr. Howard Black and Dr. Harry D. Reynolds was read setting forth\r\nthat Senator Black was too ill to leave Palo Alto. Bills were passed and\r\nbills were withdrawn. Senator Strobridge reported that Senate Bill No.\r\n862 had been correctly engrossed. And through it all the machine was\r\nwatching for the favorable moment to force the passage of the Change of\r\nVenue bill.\r\n\r\nThe moment came just before noon. Like the snap of a trap Leavitt asked\r\nfor unanimous consent to take up Assembly Bill No. 6, out of order. The\r\nanti-machine Senators are never guilty of discourteous treatment of a\r\nfellow Senator. They granted the request.\r\n\r\nSenator Wright vouched for the bill. He stated that it was a good bill\r\nand should be made a law. Senator Wolfe spoke for it, in fact led the\r\ndebate to secure its passage. On the other hand, Senator Boynton very\r\npointedly told Senator Wright that the bill was not a good measure and\r\nshould not be passed \"Judges of the Supreme Court tell me,\" said\r\nBoynton, \"that this is a bad bill.\"\r\n\r\nSenator Cutten made a strong speech against the bill, which he denounced\r\nas bad in principle. Holohan stated that if the measure became a law it\r\nwould give a bunco steerer a chance to disqualify every decent Judge in\r\nthe State. Roseberry denounced the measure as vicious.\r\n\r\nWhen the vote was taken, every Senator who supported it was in his seat,\r\nbut Burnett, Estudillo and Rush were absent. This would have made the\r\nvote 18 to 18, the backers of the measure requiring three more\r\naffirmative votes for its passage. But Miller and Lewis were led to vote\r\nfor the measure, which made 20 votes for the bill and 16 against it. At\r\nthis point the bill lacked one vote of passage. Estudillo was, however,\r\nbrought in under call of the Senate, and under what amounted to\r\nmisrepresentation, voted for the measure. This passed the bill by a vote\r\nof 21 to 18. Boynton changed his vote from no to aye, to give notice\r\nthat on the next legislative day he would move to reconsider the vote by\r\nwhich the bill had been passed. But before he could give notice the\r\nSenate took its noon recess. Boynton under the rules had all day in\r\nwhich to notify the Senate of his intention, but to make assurance\r\ndoubly sure, he told the clerk at the desk not to send the bill to the\r\nAssembly for he would as soon as the Senate re-convened, give notice of\r\nhis motion to reconsider.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, when the Senate reconvened, Boynton found that the bill\r\nhad been rushed over to the Assembly, \"to save time,\" according to the\r\nexcuse given.\r\n\r\nSenator Boynton insisted that the bill be returned from the Assembly.\r\nWolfe asked Boynton \"as a matter of Senatorial courtesy,\" to permit the\r\nvote on the bill to be taken on a motion to have it returned from the\r\nAssembly. This request was so ludicrous, in view of the treatment that\r\nhad been accorded Boynton, that it provoked a smile. Boynton refused to\r\nbe \"courteous,\" the bill was returned from the Assembly and regularly\r\nreconsidered the next day.\r\n\r\nWith 21 votes against the measure, there seemed little doubt that it\r\nwould be reconsidered and defeated. Twenty-one votes were necessary for\r\nreconsideration. Lewis and Miller had thought better of their vote of\r\nFriday and were prepared to vote against the bill. Estudillo,\r\nunderstanding the measure thoroughly, was anxious to set himself right\r\nin the record by voting against it. These, with Burnett and Rush, gave\r\ntwenty-one votes, enough to force reconsideration and to defeat the\r\nbill.\r\n\r\nBut there was a weak link in the combination,Kennedy. Senator Kennedy\r\nvoted throughout the session consistently with the Wolfe-Leavitt\r\nelement, but he voted against the Change of Venue bill. When Saturday\r\nmorning came, however, Kennedy could not be found. When reconsideration\r\nof the bill came up, Burnett and Rush were out in the hallway. Miller\r\nand Lewis voted to reconsider, which made the vote eighteen to eighteen.\r\nTwenty-one votes were necessary for reconsideration. With Kennedy,\r\nBurnett and Rush, reconsideration could be forced and the bill defeated.\r\nThe only way the absent Senators could be reached was through a call of\r\nthe Senate, which required a majority vote of those present. A motion\r\nfor a call of the Senate was defeated by a vote of eighteen to\r\neighteen[78].\r\n\r\nThis was the real test vote on the Change of Venue bill. It will be seen\r\nthat Miller and Lewis and Estudillo, who had voted for the bill the day\r\nbefore, voted for a call of the Senate. They would, on reconsideration,\r\nhave voted against the bill, and its passage on reconsideration would\r\nhave been impossible. Had Kennedy or Rush or Burnett been present, the\r\nmotion for a call of the Senate would have prevailed, the vote on the\r\nChange of Venue bill been reconsidered, and the measure defeated.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later, when Kennedy's vote was necessary to enable the\r\nmachine to continue the deadlock on the Direct Primary bill, Kennedy\r\nturned up to do his part in that not very creditable performance.\r\n\r\nIn this way did the machine element secure the passage of the Change of\r\nVenue bill. It was a question of good generalship, or, if you like,\r\ntrickery. Perhaps trickery is the better name for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[74] Black's Senate bill, 1,144, came very near being defeated in the\r\nAssembly by similar \"good generalship.\" The measure in effect prohibits\r\nthe sale of intoxicating liquors within a mile and a half of Stanford\r\nUniversity. Assemblyman Bohnett was in charge of the bill.\r\n\r\nBohnett, the day that the bill was to come up, was called from the room\r\nto attend a committee meeting. Immediately did the Assembly show\r\nastonishing activity in consideration of the file. So fast did they go\r\nthat the Stanford bill seemed destined to be reached while Bohnett was\r\nout of the room. Had it been reached with Bohnett away it could have\r\nbeen dropped to the bottom of the file, where it would have been lost,\r\nso far as the session of the Legislature of 1909 was concerned.\r\n\r\nCharles R. Detrick, of Palo Alto, happened to go to the Assembly chamber\r\nat this critical moment and took in the situation at a glance. He\r\naccordingly hunted up Bohnett, who got back to the Assembly chamber\r\nbefore the bill could be reached on file. For once \"good generalship\"\r\nhad failed at the legislative session of 1909.\r\n\r\n[74a] In 1907, the Change of Venue bill was slipped through the\r\nAssembly, but in a form not to affect the San Francisco graft cases. In\r\nthe Senate, however, it was amended to apply to Ruef, Schmitz and their\r\nassociates. The exposure of this turn raised such a storm that the bill\r\nwas not brought to vote. However, on the night before adjournment, the\r\nmeasure was slipped through the Senate as an amendment tacked on another\r\nbill. But the trick was discovered in the Assembly and defeated.\r\n\r\n[75] Governor Gillett's reasons for vetoing the bill are set forth in\r\nfootnote 1, Chapter 1.\r\n\r\n[76] The Assembly vote on the change of venue bill was as follows:\r\n\r\nFor the Change of Venue bill - Barndollar, Beatty, Black, Cattell,\r\nCoghlan, Collier, Collum, Cronin, Drew, Feeley, Flint, Gibbons,\r\nGriffiths, Hammon, Hans, Hawk, Hayes, Hewitt, Hinkle, Holmquist, Johnson\r\nof Sacramento, Johnson of San Diego, Juilliard, Lightner, Macauley,\r\nMaher, McClellan, McManus, Melrose, Mendenhall, Moore, Mott, Pugh, Rech,\r\nSchmitt, Silver, Stuckenbruck, Telfer, Transue, Wagner, Wheelan, and\r\nWilson - 42.\r\n\r\nAgainst the Change of Venue bill - Baxter, Bohnett, Butler, Callan,\r\nCogswell, Dean, Gerdes, Gillis, Kehoe, Otis, Polsley, Preston, Sackett,\r\nWhitney, and Young - 15.\r\n\r\n[77] The Senate Judiciary Committee for example.\r\n\r\n[76a] The Senators whose names are printed in italics became involved in\r\nthe confusion which led to the passage of the measure.\r\n\r\n[78] The vote was as follows:\r\n\r\nFor the call of the Senate - Bell, Birdsall, Boynton, Caminetti,\r\nCampbell, Cartwright, Curtin, Cutten, Estudillo, Holohan, Lewis, Miller,\r\nRoseberry, Sanford, Stetson, Strobridge, Thompson, Walker - 18.\r\n\r\nAgainst the call of the Senate - Anthony, Bates, Bills, Finn, Hare,\r\nHartman, Hurd, Leavitt, Martinelli, McCartney, Price, Reily, Savage,\r\nWeed, Welch, Willis, Wolfe, Wright - 18.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVII.\r\n\r\nPassage of the Wheelan Bills.\r\n\r\nMeasures Extended Abuses Which the Commonwealth Club Bills Had Been\r\nDrawn to Prevent - Went Through Both Houses Without the Members\r\nThoroughly Understanding Their Significance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe so-called Wheelan bills were passed in much the same way as was the\r\nChange of Venue bill. These measures will perhaps be better understood\r\nin comparison with certain of the Commonwealth Club bills which were\r\nconsidered in a previous chapter.\r\n\r\nAmong the Commonwealth bills was one which denied a defendant under\r\nindictment a copy of the testimony taken in the Grand Jury room. The\r\nmeasure was drawn on the theory that Grand Juries deal principally with\r\nsecret offenses, and that the testimony had better be brought out before\r\nthe trial Court. One object of the proposed law was to prevent the\r\ndefendant giving out testimony with the deliberate object of prejudicing\r\nthe entire community against him, and thus increasing the difficulty of\r\ngetting petty juries to try him.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, there are instances, as when Abe Ruef was before the Grand\r\nJury at San Francisco, when the ends of justice require that the\r\ntestimony given shall be kept secret. But, in spite of these and other\r\nconsiderations, the measure in question was allowed to die in Committee.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand two bills requiring that transcript of such testimony\r\nbe given the defendant passed both Senate and Assembly. They were\r\nintroduced by Wheelan of San Francisco.\r\n\r\nSection 925 of the Penal Code, as it stood up to the time of the opening\r\nof the session, provided that \"the Grand Jury whenever criminal causes\r\nare being investigated before them, on demand of the District Attorney\r\nmust appoint a competent stenographic reporter to be sworn and to report\r\nthe testimony that may be given in such causes in shorthand, and reduce\r\nthe same upon request of the District Attorney to long hand or\r\ntypewriting.\" It was thus left with the District Attorney to say whether\r\nthe stenographic reporter should be present, and whether his notes\r\nshould be transcribed.\r\n\r\nThe first of the Wheelan bills, Assembly bill 221[79], amended the law\r\nby cutting out the words in italics \"on demand of the District Attorney\"\r\nand \"upon request of the District Attorney,\" making it mandatory upon\r\nthe Grand Jury to have the reporter in attendance.\r\n\r\nFurther on in the section and in Assembly bill 222[79], it was provided\r\nthat a true copy of the testimony thus taken should be given the\r\ndefendant at the time of his arraignment.\r\n\r\nThese two measures passed both Senate and Assembly.\r\n\r\nAssembly bill 223[79], also introduced by Wheelan, provided another\r\ncause for the setting aside of an indictment by the Court in which the\r\ndefendant is arraigned, upon such defendant's motion. The Commonwealth\r\nbills aimed to prevent technical attacks upon indictments. The third of\r\nthe Wheelan bills - No. 223 - opened the way for further technical\r\nattacks, by providing that the Court must set aside the indictment \"when\r\nit appears from the testimony taken before the Grand jury that the\r\ndefendant has been indicted upon a criminal charge without reasonable or\r\nprobable cause.\"\r\n\r\nThis measure passed both Houses. It opened the way for review before the\r\nCourt of the testimony taken in the Grand jury room, and endless\r\ntechnical objections, all of which by clever counsel can be employed to\r\ndelay the case being brought before a trial jury, and in the end perhaps\r\nwear out the prosecution, thus preventing the case being tried on its\r\nmerits. With that section in the law two years ago, it is a question\r\nwhether the defendants in the graft prosecution at San Francisco would\r\never have been brought to trial.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that while the Commonwealth Club bills aimed to decrease\r\nthe opportunities for technical defense of men charged with crime, and\r\nthus permit the cases being tried on their merits, the Wheelan bills\r\nincreased opportunity for technical objection.\r\n\r\nThe history of the passage of the Wheelan bills is practically the same\r\nin each instance.\r\n\r\nThe three bills were introduced by Mr. Wheelan on January 11th, and\r\nreferred to the Assembly Judiciary Committee. The Committee, which\r\npigeon-holed sixty-three of the Commonwealth Club bills, and reported\r\nback the two remaining too late for passage, had better treatment in\r\nstore for the Wheelan measures. They were reported back to the Assembly\r\non March 6th, at a time when the Assembly was fairly swamped with\r\npending measures. On March 17th, in the midst of a mass of legislation,\r\nthey were slipped through the Assembly without many of the members\r\napparently knowing what they were. The Assembly journal of that date\r\nshows that such men as Bohnett, Callan, Cattell, Cogswell, Flint,\r\nGerdes, Gibbons, Gillis, Hayes, Hewitt, Hinkle, Johnson of Placer,\r\nJuilliard, Kehoe, Mendenhall, Polsley, Stuckenbruck, Telfer, Whitney,\r\nWilson and Wyllie, who ordinarily voted for good measures and against\r\nbad ones, voted for the Wheelan bills.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of Bill No. 223, not one vote was cast against the\r\nmeasures. The vote on Bill No. 223 was the last taken. Gillis, who had\r\nvoted for the two others, appears to have awakened to the fact that\r\nsomething was wrong. At any rate, he voted against Bill 223.\r\n\r\nHis was the only vote cast against any of the three bills in the lower\r\nHouse, They appear to have gone through the Assembly without thorough\r\nappreciation of their significance. At any rate, there were members\r\nenough present, who were usually against bad measures, to have prevented\r\nthe Wheelan bills securing the forty-one votes necessary for their\r\npassage.\r\n\r\nA reform measure passing the Assembly on March 17th would have had no\r\nchance whatever in the Senate. The Wheelan bills were more fortunate.\r\n\r\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee, before which the Commonwealth Club bills\r\nhad dragged along for weeks, received the Wheelan bills on March 17th,\r\nthe day they passed the Assembly, and the same day, March 17th, reported\r\nthem back to the Senate with the recommendation that they do pass. On\r\nMarch 18th the measures were read the second time in the Senate, and on\r\nMarch 20th, three days after they had passed the Assembly, the Senate\r\npassed them.\r\n\r\nSuch is the difference in action on machine-favored bills and bills\r\nwhich the machine does not favor. Incidentally, it may be said that at\r\nthe time the Wheelan bills were before the Senate, the machine had that\r\nbody tied up in the fight on the Direct Primary bill.\r\n\r\nThe reform element - at the mercy of the Senate organization - was\r\ncompelled to devote its whole attention to the Direct Primary bill. The\r\nmachine was thus left to run committees and Senate at its own free will.\r\nIt was an admirable situation from the machine standpoint.\r\n\r\nBut by the time the Wheelan bills had been hastened to the floor of the\r\nSenate, the reform Senators apparently awoke to the fact that some sort\r\nof a job was on the way. When the bills came up for final passage,\r\nhowever, the anti-machine Senators were apparently as much at a loss\r\nconcerning them as the anti-machine Assemblymen had been.\r\n\r\nBill number 221 came up first, and even Senator Bell, the staunchest\r\nopponent of bad laws of them all, voted for it. With Senator Bell voted\r\nCaminetti, Estudillo, Rush, Thompson and Walker, who were ordinarily\r\nagainst the passage of bad bills. As the measure received but\r\ntwenty-three votes, any three of these by voting no could have defeated\r\nit.\r\n\r\nPrice, who had voted for the bill, gave notice, at the request of a\r\nfellow Senator, that on the next legislative day he would move to\r\nreconsider the vote by which the bill had been passed.\r\n\r\nBefore taking up Assembly bill 222, companion bill to 221, the Senate\r\npassed three measures and considered several others. By the time\r\nAssembly bill 222 was reached, Senator Bell had got his bearings, and\r\nvoted against it. Caminetti had also found himself, and although\r\nCaminetti voted for the measure, he gave notice, that on the next\r\nlegislative day he would move for its reconsideration.\r\n\r\nThe third of the bills, No. 223, followed 222, and Walker, who had voted\r\nfor the two other bills, voted \"no.\" The bill was passed by twenty-three\r\nvotes, Cutten voting \"aye\" for the purpose of giving notice to\r\nreconsider.\r\n\r\nThe motions to reconsider were voted upon on the afternoon of Monday,\r\nMarch 22, the day of the final fight on the Direct Primary bill in both\r\nSenate and Assembly. Nobody was thinking of much of anything else that\r\nday. In every instance reconsideration was denied[80]. The vote by which\r\nthey had passed the Senate stood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[79] Governor Gillett signed Assembly bills Nos. 221 and 222. They are\r\nnow the law of the State. Assembly bill No. 223 he did not sign. It did\r\nnot, therefore, become a law.\r\n\r\n[80] The Assembly history of March 23, fails to record that the motions\r\nto reconsider were made on the three Wheelan bills. In an article\r\nconcerning these bills which the writer prepared for the Sacramento Bee,\r\ngoverned by the official record of the measures, the History of the\r\nHouse in which they originated, he stated that motions for their\r\nreconsideration were not made. The Senate Journal of March 22, however,\r\npages 23 and 26, shows that these motions were made, and in all three\r\ncases defeated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVIII.\r\n\r\nDefeat of the Local Option Bill.\r\n\r\nPeculiar Arrangement by Which the Bill Was Sidetracked in the Assembly -\r\nStanton Promised That It Should Pass the Lower House If It Passed the\r\nSenate - How It Was Smothered in the Upper House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause there is no particular reason why California should not have a\r\nLocal Option law, in the face of popular demand for it, a large number\r\nof very worthy citizens assumed that one would be passed. The fact seems\r\nto have been lost sight of that the tenderloin element opposes such\r\nlegislation, and that the management of the so-called liquor interests\r\norganized as the \"Royal Arch,\" takes a shortsighted view of Local Option\r\nprovisions. The machine was thus interested. Its representatives in\r\nSenate and Assembly did not propose that any Local Option bill should\r\npass. So the Local Option bill was smothered. The smothering process\r\nmost suggestively indicates how such things can be done.\r\n\r\nThe measure was introduced in the Assembly by Wyllie and in the Senate\r\nby Estudillo. In the face of the popular demand for the passage of such\r\na bill, and the exasperation of a no small portion of the voters of the\r\nState, at the mistake - or trick - by which in 1907 the only measure\r\nresembling a Local Option law was rubbed off the statute books, it was\r\nnot good policy to fight the bill in the open. So the machine proceeded\r\nto do covertly what would have been \"poor politics\" to do openly[81].\r\n\r\nThe same bill having been introduced both in Senate and Assembly, the\r\nfirst step was to tie up either the Assembly or the Senate measure, so\r\nthat the whole crafty campaign against the bill's passage could be\r\nconfined to one House. The way in which this was done was simplicity\r\nitself. The Wyllie bill, as introduced in the Assembly was, at the\r\nrequest of Speaker Stanton, held up in the Assembly Committee on Public\r\nMorals. Most plausible reason was given for this course. It was pointed\r\nout that since the Assembly had gone on record before the Senate on the\r\nanti-gambling bill, on women's suffrage[80a] and other \"moral\" issues,\r\nit was unfair to compel the lower House to go on record before the\r\nSenate on the Local Option bill. Speaker Stanton assured the proponents\r\nof the measure that if it passed the Senate, it should pass the\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\nStanton accordingly recognized that the Assembly, given an opportunity,\r\nwould pass the bill. Had it passed the Assembly before the middle of\r\nFebruary, it would unquestionably have passed the Senate. But the\r\nproponents of the measure consented to the plan to make the Senate act\r\nfirst. The fight for the passage of the bill accordingly took place in\r\nthe Senate.\r\n\r\nBefore taking up the Senate measure introduced by Estudillo, the Wyllie\r\nbill may as well be disposed of. It was introduced in the Assembly\r\nJanuary 8th, and was sent to the Committee on Public Morals. There it\r\nlay until March 13th, two months and five days, when the proponents of\r\nthe measure, realizing that they were being tricked, made their protest\r\nso loud that the measure was reported by the Committee, but without\r\nrecommendation. There was no time then to pass the bill, and on March\r\n15th it was withdrawn by its author.\r\n\r\nThe Estudillo bill, as it was known on the Senate side of the Capitol,\r\nhad a more eventful history. Introduced in the Senate on January 8th, it\r\nhad gone to the famous Committee on Election Laws, which had been\r\nstacked for the defeat of the Direct Primary bill. Estudillo was, to be\r\nsure, Chairman of the Committee, but a lamb herding lions never had a\r\nharder job on its hands than did Estudillo. He could not get his\r\ncommittee together to consider the well-backed Direct Primary bill, let\r\nalone the worthy but not politically supported local option measure.\r\n\r\nAlong about the middle of February, however, Estudillo succeeded in\r\ngetting the committee to act. By a vote of four to four the committee\r\nrefused to recommend the Local Option bill for passage. Senator Stetson,\r\nwho favored the passage of the measure, to compel committee action and\r\nget the bill before the Senate, thereupon moved that the bill be\r\nreferred back to the Senate with recommendation that it do not pass.\r\nSenator Stetson's motion prevailed.\r\n\r\nThus, the measure went back to the Senate with a majority committee\r\nreport that it do not pass. But in spite of this adverse report, the\r\nSenate passed the measure on second reading and sent it to engrossment\r\nand third reading. It looked very much just then as though the bill\r\nwould pass the Senate.\r\n\r\nBut the resourceful machine had other plans. When the measure came up\r\nfor final passage on February 24th, instead of being voted upon, and\r\npassed or defeated, it was amended.\r\n\r\nTo amend a bill on third reading exasperates those who are supporting it\r\nas nothing else can. The bill must, when thus amended, be reprinted and\r\nre-engrossed before it can be passed. The delays thus caused very often\r\nresult in the defeat of the measure.\r\n\r\nBut the reprinted and re-engrossed Local Option bill got back to the\r\nSenate on February 26th, and its supporters could think of no other\r\npossible excuse for delaying its passage.\r\n\r\nBut the machine could, and did. On Senator Wolfe's motion - the reader\r\nwill no doubt remember that Senator Wolfe led the fight against the\r\nDirect Primary bill, against the Anti-Gambling bill and against the\r\neffective Stetson Railroad Regulation bill - on Senator Wolfe's motion\r\nthe Local Option bill, instead of being put on its final passage, was\r\nsent to the Senate Judiciary Committee.\r\n\r\nAt that time, the closing days of February, the Judiciary Committee was\r\nfairly swamped with important measures. The Railroad Regulation bills,\r\nthe Initiative Amendment, the measures providing for the simplification\r\nof methods of criminal procedure and other bills of scarcely less\r\nimportance were pending before that committee. Prompt action on the\r\nLocal Option bill was out of the question. And, although a majority of\r\nthe committee favored the passage of the bill, the minority which was\r\nagainst it took precious good care that no undue haste should attend its\r\nconsideration. Estudillo was in constant attendance upon the committee,\r\nbut to little purpose. It was not until March 4th that the committee\r\nacted. The action was, of course, recommendation that the bill do pass.\r\n\r\nThe bill had been amended from time to time, but as it was finally\r\napproved by the Judiciary Committee was a reasonably effective measure.\r\nIt provided that on a petition signed by 25 per cent of the electors of\r\nany city, or town, or county, the question of license or no license must\r\nbe put on the regular election ballot. If a majority of the electors\r\nvoted against the issuing of liquor licenses in any city or town or\r\ntownship, the governing body could no longer issue saloon licenses.\r\nOutside incorporated cities and towns, the basis of prohibition was made\r\nthe township, although the vote was to be taken throughout the county.\r\n\r\nAfter the measure had been returned from the Judiciary Committee of the\r\nSenate, Estudillo fought manfully to have it considered. He finally\r\nsucceeded, on March 8th, in having the bill made a special order, that\r\nis to say, he arranged that the Senate should consider it at 8 o'clock\r\nof Thursday, March 11th.\r\n\r\nBut when Thursday came it developed that Senators Stetson and Boynton\r\ncould not be present that evening, and they asked Estudillo to have the\r\nvote on the measure postponed until noon of the next day, Friday. This\r\nEstudillo attempted to do. The thing was done with other bills every\r\nday. Had Wolfe made the request, for example, or even Estudillo on any\r\nother measure than the Local Option bill, the request would have been\r\ngranted without thought or comment. But on Wolfe's objection Estudillo's\r\nrequest was denied. The machine saw its opportunity and succeeded in\r\nhaving consideration of the bill postponed until the following Monday,\r\nMarch 15th. This meant the defeat of the bill. Even had it passed the\r\nSenate on that date, filibustering tactics would have defeated it in the\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the backers of the measure - although pleaded with by\r\nweak-kneed Senators to withdraw the bill - insisted upon a vote being\r\ntaken, when the measure came up on March 15th. This decision compelled\r\nWolfe to make his famous \"Fate of the Republican Party\" speech, in which\r\nhe predicted that if the Local Option bill became a law, utter wreck\r\nwould come upon the Republican party in California. Birdsall, Caminetti,\r\nHolohan, Rush, Sanford and Strobridge, whose votes were ordinarily\r\nrecorded against the machine Senators, voted against the bill, as did\r\nAnthony and Curtin. Wright voted for the measure, but otherwise those\r\nwho had voted against the Walker-Otis Anti-Gambling bill, against a\r\nState-wide vote for United States Senators, against the Stetson Railroad\r\nRegulation bill, in a word, those whom for the want of a better term we\r\ncall machine Senators, voted solidly against the Local Option bill[82].\r\n\r\nThe final showing for the Local Option bill was not a good one, but in\r\nspite of it, many in touch with conditions in the Senate held that had\r\nthe vote been taken in the middle of February instead of the middle of\r\nMarch, the bill would have had a good chance for passage. After the\r\ndelay of ten weeks from the time of its introduction until the final\r\nvote upon it, there was no chance at all for it to become a law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[81] Up to the legislative session of 1907, the County Government Act\r\nprovided that the Supervisors of a county could submit any question -\r\nincluding the matter of regulating the liquor traffic - to the voters\r\nfor the purpose of ascertaining their opinion upon the issue. There was,\r\nhowever, no way to compel the Supervisors to take the action that might\r\nbe thus decided upon by popular vote. The Supervisors could act upon the\r\nvote or ignore it, as they saw fit.\r\n\r\nThe Legislature of 1907 transferred the County Government Act to the\r\nCodes. For some reason, either by intention or oversight, the section\r\nwhich permitted Supervisors to submit questions to the people for an\r\nadvisory vote was omitted. It has been held that this action of the\r\nLegislature repealed the section by implication. It is held, therefore,\r\nthat no law is upon the Statute books by which the people may be\r\npermitted to vote even in an advisory capacity upon any question of\r\npolice regulation or public policy.\r\n\r\n[80a] A fine example of a lightning switch of plan on the part of the\r\nmachine came in the fight on the Women's Suffrage Amendment. The\r\ntenderloin and liquor interests in general are opposed to the submission\r\nof this amendment to the people, which means, of course, that the\r\nmachine is against it. To submit the amendment to the people, fifty-four\r\nvotes are required in the Assembly and twenty-seven in the Senate. This\r\nyear, the program was to let the amendment pass the Assembly and defeat\r\nit in the Senate. Assemblymen were allowed to pledge themselves to its\r\nsupport until there were fifty-eight Assemblymen down to vote for it.\r\nGrove L. Johnson had introduced the measure in the Assembly, and its\r\nadoption by that body seemed assured.\r\n\r\nBut the Anti-Racetrack Gambling bill got in the way of Woman's Suffrage\r\nin a most curious manner. When the passage of this anti-gambling bill\r\nbecame a certainty, that branch of the group of tenderloin Senators\r\nwhose interests were wrapped up in racetrack gambling, became \"very\r\nsore.\" In their disgruntlement they decided to give reform full swing,\r\nand put the Woman's Suffrage Amendment through the Senate. This attitude\r\nseriously alarmed the safe, sane and respectable leaders of the machine,\r\nwho see all sorts of trouble for the machine if women are given the\r\nballot. So to prevent its tenderloin associates in the Senate doing\r\nanything rash, the machine decided rather late in the day to defeat the\r\namendment in the Assembly.\r\n\r\nWhen this decision was reached, and the order to carry it into effect\r\ngiven, the machine Assemblymen who had agreed to vote for the amendment\r\ncoolly forgot their pledges. Instead of fifty-eight votes, only\r\nthirty-nine were cast for the amendment.\r\n\r\nGrove L. Johnson, who had introduced it, and who pretended to support\r\nit, agreed to move for its reconsideration. When the hour for the motion\r\nfor reconsideration came, Johnson huddled up in his seat, looking\r\nneither to right or left, let the opportunity pass.\r\n\r\nThe vote by which the amendment was defeated was as follows:\r\n\r\nFor the amendment: Barndollar, Bohnett, Butler, Callan, Cattell,\r\nCoghlan, Cogswell, Collum, Costar, Cronin, Drew, Gibbons, Gillis, Hayes,\r\nHewitt, Hinkle, Holmquist, Hopkins, Johnson of Sacramento, Johnson of\r\nSan Diego, Johnson of Placer, Juilliard, Kehoe, Maher, Melrose,\r\nMendenhall, Otis, O'Neil, Polsley, Pulcifer, Sackett, Silver,\r\nStuckenbruck, Telfer, Webber, Wheelan, Wilson, Wyllie, Young - 39.\r\n\r\nAgainst the amendment: Baxter, Beardslee, Beatty, Beban, Collier,\r\nCullen, Dean, Feeley, Flavelle, Fleisher, Flint, Gerdes, Greer,\r\nGriffiths, Hammon, Hanlon, Hans, Hawk, Johnston of Contra Costa, Leeds,\r\nLightner, Macaulay, McClellan, McManus, Moore, Mott, Nelson, Odom,\r\nPreston, Pugh, Rech, Rutherford, Schmitt, Stanton, Transue, Wagner,\r\nWhitney - 37.\r\n\r\n[82] The vote on the local option bill was as follows:\r\n\r\nFor the bill - Bell, Black, Boynton, Campbell, Cartwright, Cutten,\r\nEstudillo, Miller, Roseberry, Thompson, Walker, Wright - 12.\r\n\r\nAgainst the bill - Anthony, Bills, Birdsall, Burnett, Caminetti, Curtin,\r\nFinn, Hare, Hartman, Holohan, Hurd, Kennedy, Leavitt, Lewis, Martinelli,\r\nMcCartney, Price, Reily, Rush, Sanford, Strobridge, Weed, Welch, Willis,\r\nWolfe - 25.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIX.\r\n\r\nDefeat of the Initiative Amendment.\r\n\r\nAs in the Case of Other Reform Measures It Was Held Back Until Near the\r\nClose of the Session - Principle Adopted by Many California\r\nMunicipalities - Machine Thoroughly Aroused to Its Importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA most estimable old lady once tried with indifferent success to hold\r\nback the incoming tide of the Atlantic with a broom. As one watches the\r\nefforts of the machine, through such agents as Gus Hartman, Eddie Wolfe\r\nand Frank Leavitt, to stem the reform movement which is sweeping the\r\ncountry, he is strongly reminded of the old lady's endeavor.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, the machine, at the legislative session of 1909, by trick\r\nand clever manipulation succeeded in preventing any very effective\r\nreform legislation going on the Statute books. But nevertheless the\r\nmachine was compelled in response to the popular demand to permit the\r\npassage of a direct primary law, however inadequate and disappointing it\r\nmay prove to be, and a railroad regulation law, however ineffective.\r\n\r\nThe machine's success was not on the whole so much in its permanent\r\ndefeat of good measures as in delaying their adoption. The machine,\r\nexcept in the case of the race-track gamblers, could and did put off the\r\nday of the people's reckoning with machine-protected interests, but on\r\ndesperately small margins at times, and under conditions which point\r\nplainly to the machine's ultimate undoing.\r\n\r\nA bull once attempted to stop a freight train with his head. The train\r\nwas brought to a standstill and the animal driven off the track. A short\r\ntime later the bull tried the same experiment with an express train. The\r\ntrain did not stop, nor was it seriously delayed.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the reform movement is to place the government of Nation,\r\nState and city back into the hands of the people. To this end States and\r\nmunicipalities throughout the country are trying the direct primary\r\nsystem of nominating candidates for office, extending the principle of\r\nlocal option, establishing the Initiative, the Referendum and the\r\nRecall, and experimenting, often with admirable success, sometimes with\r\ndiscouraging failure, with other \"wicked innovations,\" as Assemblyman\r\nGrove L. Johnson would call them.\r\n\r\nWithout the machine fully appreciating what has been going on,\r\nCalifornia has for a decade or more been pushing rapidly to the fore in\r\nthe promotion of these reforms. In this State the reform policies have\r\nfound their best expression in recently adopted municipal charters.\r\nThese charters must be ratified by the Legislature, but up to the\r\nsession just closed their ratification - \"wicked innovations and all\"\r\n- has met with no particular opposition.\r\n\r\nThus we find most of the modern charters of California municipalities\r\ncontaining provisions for really effective primary nominations by the\r\npeople[83], for the initiation of laws, for the referendum, even for the\r\nrecall from office of corrupt officials, which have placed in the hands\r\nof the people of the cities a club over the machine which has proved\r\nmost effective.\r\n\r\nBut the machine is now fully alive to what such provisions as the\r\ninitiative and the recall mean. When, for example, the machine in\r\ncontrol of the City Council attempted to deny the Western Pacific right\r\nof way through the City of Sacramento, the people resorted to the\r\ncharter provision granting them the Initiative, and by their direct vote\r\nawarded the right of way.\r\n\r\nEven while the Legislature was in session, one of the machine's most\r\neffective workers, Walter Parker, could not be present at his post at\r\nSacramento, because he was required at Los Angeles, where, because of\r\nthe \"recall,\" the machine was in a peck of trouble.\r\n\r\nThe people of that city were employing the recall provision of their\r\ncharter against the machine Mayor trapped in corruption. Although the\r\nthen Mayor is a \"Democrat\" and Parker a \"Republican,\" Parker's presence\r\nwas required at Los Angeles to back the machine's efforts to hold the\r\nMayor in his job.\r\n\r\nSo Parker could not be at Sacramento, where the machine really needed\r\nhim. The machine leaders did not think it possible that a real Mayor -\r\nespecially a machine Mayor - could be dismissed from office through such\r\na \"fool innovation\" as the recall. But that's what, in spite of machine\r\nefforts, happened at Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nThese experiences and others like them, forced it upon the understanding\r\nof machine leaders that the initiative, recall and similar\r\n\"innovations,\" have a business end; that they put altogether too much\r\npower into the hands of the people for the machine's safety.\r\n\r\nUp to the session of 1909 there had been practically no opposition to\r\nthe ratification of charters adopted by the several municipalities. But\r\nthis year the machine leader in the Senate, Wolfe, let it be known that\r\nhe would henceforth oppose \"freak charters,\" \"freak charters\" to Senator\r\nWolfe being those of the initiative-referendum-recall order.\r\n\r\nSeveral municipalities - Berkeley, San Diego, Palo Alto, Santa Barbara,\r\nSan Bernardino, Richmond, Los Angeles, Pasadena and Oakland - had either\r\nsent new charters or important amendments to existing charters to the\r\nLegislature for ratification. Many of the charters and amendments came\r\ndecidedly under Wolfe's ideas of \"freak.\" But there are some extremes to\r\nwhich the machine dare not go, and it did not dare to go on record as\r\nagainst popular municipal government. Wolfe and his associates could and\r\ndid grumble, but they did not dare refuse the several charters and\r\ncharter amendments ratification.\r\n\r\nSo they let the charters and charter amendments go by them and braced\r\nthemselves against granting Statewide initiative.\r\n\r\nThat issue came up in the form of a proposed amendment to the State\r\nConstitution introduced by Senator Black, which gave the people of the\r\nState the power enjoyed by the people of Oregon and of the more advanced\r\nCalifornia municipalities, the power to initiate laws.\r\n\r\nBlack's amendment provided that on petition of eight per cent of the\r\nelectors of the State proposing a law or Constitutional amendment, such\r\nlaw or amendment must be submitted to a vote of the people at the next\r\ngeneral election, precisely as Constitutional amendments are now\r\nsubmitted. If the proposed law or amendment received a majority vote it\r\nwas to become a law of the State, independent of Legislative action. In\r\na word, the people of California, had the amendment carried, would have\r\nbeen able to initiate the laws which govern them.\r\n\r\nNaturally, the machine, always on thin ice at best, thoroughly aroused\r\nto what the initiative means, opposed any such \"wicked innovation.\"\r\n\r\nIn its opposition, the machine was backed by that extreme conservatism,\r\nwhich, while sincere enough, forever hangs on the coattails of progress;\r\nthe conservatism which even in New England as late as 1860 drew back its\r\nrespectable skirts from abolition; the conservatism which, dragged\r\nprotesting over a crisis, never fails to assume for itself all the\r\ncredit for what has been accomplished. Thus the machine had some very\r\nrespectable assistance in its efforts against the Initiative Amendment,\r\nthe measure which more than any other before the Legislature was\r\ncalculated to take the government of California out of machine\r\nhands[84].\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the amendment had strong backing. It had been drawn\r\nup at the instance of the Direct Legislation League, which numbers among\r\nits members many of the foremost bankers, capitalists, educators and\r\npublic men of the State - Rudolph Spreckels, Francis J. Heney, James D.\r\nPhelan, of San Francisco, and Dr. John R. Haynes of Los Angeles, and\r\nothers fully as prominent being among the League's most active\r\nsupporters.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the amendment had the endorsement of the State Grange, of,\r\nthe Labor Unions, of the State, county and municipal Democratic\r\nconventions, and of many of the municipal and county Republican\r\nconventions.\r\n\r\nBut there were plenty of reasons given why the amendment should not be\r\nsubmitted to the people. Perhaps the most amusing came from Senator\r\nWright, of Direct Primary and Railroad Regulation notoriety. Senator\r\nWright held that inasmuch as the Direct Primary will result in the\r\nelection of high-class legislators, the initiative will not be\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nBut the two principal objections raised to the initiative were that:\r\n\r\n1. It would lead to a flood of bills being submitted to the people.\r\n\r\n2. That the people would not take sufficient interest in the proposed\r\nlaws to consider them carefully.\r\n\r\nBoth these objections were readily answered by the proponents of the\r\namendment, who gave the experience of States in which the initiative has\r\nbeen tried.\r\n\r\nOregon, for example, adopted the initiative in 1902. In 1904 but two\r\nproposed laws were introduced under it; in 1906, five; and in 1908,\r\nnineteen. Inasmuch as in 1908 California voted upon twenty-one\r\nconstitutional amendments and statutes which had been submitted by the\r\nLegislature of 1907, it will be seen that Oregon was not particularly\r\nsubmerged by a flood of elector-initiated legislation.\r\n\r\nIn Canton Berne, Switzerland, where for half a century all the laws have\r\nbeen adopted by the initiative system, the average of laws proposed has\r\nbeen only two and a half a year.\r\n\r\nAs to the second objection, it was easily shown that in Oregon the\r\nkeenest interest is taken in the measures proposed through the\r\ninitiative. Some were shown to have been adopted by enormous majorities;\r\nothers to have been rejected by majorities as large.\r\n\r\nThus the objections to the amendment were easily disposed of.\r\n\r\nTheir arguments answered, the opponents of the amendment schemed to\r\nprevent its consideration until the closing days of the session or\r\nprevent consideration entirely.\r\n\r\nIn the Assembly, the amendment had been introduced by Drew of Fresno. It\r\nwas referred to the Committee on Constitutional Amendments, where it was\r\nsmothered to death. Although referred to the committee on January 11,\r\nthe committee took no action upon it. Coghlan of San Francisco was\r\nchairman of the committee; associated with him were Legislators of the\r\ntypes of Johnson of Sacramento, McClelland and Baxter. In vain those\r\nadvocating the adoption of the amendment urged the committee to act.\r\nMeetings were indeed arranged, at which the proponents of the reform\r\nwould be present, but the committeemen would fail to attend.\r\n\r\nA less exasperating, but no less effective fight was carried on in the\r\nSenate.\r\n\r\nOn the Senate side, the amendment introduced by Black went to the\r\nJudiciary Committee. This committee was made up of the nineteen lawyers\r\nin the Senate, every lawyer going on the committee. But Warren Porter\r\nnamed the order of their rank, and the chairman and the four ranking\r\nmembers of the committee voted eternally with the Wolfe-Leavitt faction.\r\nOn a straight vote the majority of the committee was against the\r\nmachine, as was shown in the fight for an effective railroad regulation\r\nbill. But when it came to getting results in the Senate Judiciary\r\nCommittee, craft and leadership, as has been shown in previous chapters,\r\nnot infrequently overcame numbers.\r\n\r\nOn February 16, the reform element of the committee insisted that action\r\nbe taken on the amendment. Chairman Willis was reluctant to put the\r\nquestion. Few machine members of the committee were in attendance. The\r\nanti-machine members were insistent. Willis was finally forced to put\r\nthe question, and the amendment, after the percentage of voters required\r\nto sign a petition for the initiation of a law had been raised from\r\neight to twelve per cent, was favorably reported back to the Senate.\r\n\r\nBut Senator Willis was able to do on the floor of the Senate what he had\r\nbeen unable to do in the committee, namely, secure further delay. He\r\nprotested to the Senate at the \"snap judgment\" of his committee, with\r\nthe result that it was re-referred to that body. The committee, however,\r\nfor the second time sent it back to the Senate with the recommendation\r\nthat it be adopted.\r\n\r\nThen followed a series of delays in the Senate, so that the measure was\r\nnot brought to vote until March 11th.\r\n\r\nFor the adoption of a Constitutional amendment, a two-thirds vote -\r\ntwenty-seven - is required in the Senate. The proponents of the\r\namendment had good reason to believe that that number of Senators would\r\nvote for its adoption. The Senators counted upon to vote for the\r\namendment were: Anthony, Bell, Birdsall, Black, Boynton, Caminetti,\r\nCampbell, Cutten, Estudillo, Hare, Kennedy, McCartney, Reily, Roseberry,\r\nRush, Sanford, Stetson, Thompson, Walker, Welch - 20, who actually voted\r\nfor the amendment; Finn, Strobridge, Cartwright and Holohan, who were\r\nabsent when the vote was taken, but who were pledged to the reform;\r\nLewis, Bills, Curtin and Miller, who were counted on the side of the\r\namendment until it came to a vote. This made twenty-eight votes, one\r\nmore than enough for adoption.\r\n\r\nKennedy, Reily, Welch, Finn and Hare, usually against reform\r\nlegislation, were counted for the Initiative because of convention\r\nobligations which could not well be ignored. Lewis, McCartney and Bills\r\nwere counted for it because of their alleged promise of its support;\r\nCurtin and Miller because the Democratic State Convention had endorsed\r\nthe Initiative, and for the further reason that Curtin and Miller were\r\nordinarily for reform legislation.\r\n\r\nBut on the vote, the unfortunate Hare, Kennedy, Reily, McCartney and\r\nWelch remained true to their obligations, while Curtin and Miller\r\ndisappointed those who had expected their support. The negative vote of\r\nBills and Lewis did not cause much disappointment, for little else was\r\nto have been expected, and anyway, the negative votes of Curtin and\r\nMiller were enough to defeat the amendment.\r\n\r\nCurtin and Miller, in spite of their party's endorsement of the policy,\r\nexpressed themselves as \"scandalized\" at such an idea as the Initiative.\r\nBut as good men as Miller and Curtin were scandalized at the idea of\r\nabolition in 1860, only to become the most earnest supporters of the\r\nEmancipation Proclamation three years later.\r\n\r\nReform waves, like the Atlantic Ocean, are not kept back with brooms -\r\nor Gus Hartmans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[83] For example the charters of Los Angeles and of Berkeley. The\r\nBerkeley charter is a model in this respect. It provides that any\r\nqualified citizen may become a candidate for municipal office, by\r\npetition of twenty-five electors, AND IN NO OTHER WAY. The party tag is\r\nthus done away with. At the election, if a candidate receive a majority\r\nof the votes he is declared elected. If no candidate receive a majority,\r\nthen a second election is held at which the two candidates receiving the\r\nhighest pluralities become candidates, the names of all other candidates\r\nwho participated at the first election are dropped. The candidate at the\r\nsecond election who receives the majority is declared elected. A\r\nmovement is on foot to have a similar provision incorporated into the\r\nSan Francisco charter.\r\n\r\n[84] \"As a source of public education upon which free government must\r\nalways rest, as a means of conservative progress, upon which the\r\ncontinued life of all nations depends, as a check upon paternalism and\r\nrich gifts calculated to lull to sleep the love of freedom, as the key\r\nthat may be used to open the door to equal opportunity, the Initiative\r\nis fundamentally more important than all other proposed reforms put\r\ntogether. \" - Arthur Twining Hadley, LL. D., in \"The Constitutional\r\nPosition of Property in America.\"\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note, that nearly a quarter of a century ago. Bryce\r\nin his American Commonwealth, pointed out that this country could not\r\nwithout the initiation of laws by The People enjoy the fruits of its\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XX.\r\n\r\nDefeat of the Anti-Japanese Bills[86].\r\n\r\nStir Storm in the Assembly, But All the Bills Were Finally Defeated -\r\nGrove L. Johnson Denounces Action of Governor Gillett and President\r\nRoosevelt - Speaker Stanton Places Himself in a Very Embarrassing\r\nPosition - His Effective Speech Becomes a Joke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Japanese problem under the bludgeoning of the big stick in the\r\nskilled hands of President Roosevelt, and free application of the\r\norganization switch in the hands of Governor Gillett, was kept fairly\r\nwell under control during the entire session. That the problem is real\r\nwas demonstrated by the numerous resolutions and alien-regulation bills\r\nwhich were introduced in both Houses. The Assembly, however, was the\r\nscene of the final defeat of the anti-Japanese element. There the\r\nlegislative campaign against the Japanese was fought out, and there it\r\nwas lost.\r\n\r\nThe contest in the Assembly narrowed down to three measures, Assembly\r\nBill 78, introduced by Drew of Fresno, known as the \"Alien Land Bill\";\r\nAssembly Bill 14, known as the \"Anti-Japanese School Bill,\" and Assembly\r\nBill 32, known as the \"Municipal Segregation Bill,\" both introduced by\r\nJohnson of Sacramento. The final defeat of these bills settled the\r\nJapanese question so far as the legislative session of 1909 was\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nDrew's Alien Land bill was by far the most important of the three. It\r\nwas in effect a copy of the alien land law at present in force in the\r\nState of Illinois, and generally known as the \"Illinois Law.\" Under its\r\nprovisions an alien acquiring title to lands situate in this State, was\r\ngiven five years in which to become a citizen of the United States;\r\nfailing to become a citizen, he was required to dispose of his holdings\r\nto a citizen; failing so to do, the necessary machinery was provided for\r\nthe District Attorney of the county in which the land was situated to\r\ndispose of it, and turn the proceeds of the sale over to the alien\r\nowner. Ample protection was provided for alien minors who might possess\r\nor might become possessed of California real property. Furthermore,\r\nunder the provisions of the law, the leasing of land to aliens for a\r\nlonger period than one year was prohibited.\r\n\r\nThough the word, \"Japanese,\" did not appear, the bill's introduction was\r\na shot which if not heard round the world, at least reached Washington\r\non the East and Tokio on the West. Finally, on January 25, Governor\r\nGillett made the Alien bills pending before the Legislature subject of a\r\nspecial message to Senate and Assembly, in which he urged the\r\nLegislature to do nothing that would disrupt the pleasant relations\r\nexisting between America and Japan, and recommended that an\r\nappropriation be made to enable the Labor Commissioner to take a census\r\nshowing the number of Japanese now in the State, with such other\r\ninformation regarding them as could be used in making a proper report to\r\nthe President and Congress[87a].\r\n\r\nGovernor Gillett in the paragraph of his message[87] which dealt with\r\nthe Alien Land bill, stated that the measure might be amended so that\r\nits passage would not embarrass the Federal Government. Mr. Drew\r\npromptly sent the Governor a note, inquiring \"how amended.\" The Governor\r\nreplied[88], stating that, in his judgment the best possible law that\r\ncould be passed on the question of alien ownership of land would be the\r\nlaw which had been adopted by Oklahoma. Furthermore, the Governor\r\nexpressed the opinion that such a law would be satisfactory to President\r\nRoosevelt and Secretary Root.\r\n\r\nMr. Drew was quick to act on the suggestion. He not only yielded to the\r\nGovernor's wishes[89], but in the teeth of the severest opposition from\r\nthe San Francisco delegation, forced delay of the passage of his bill\r\nuntil the Oklahoma law could be substituted for that taken from the\r\nIllinois Statutes.\r\n\r\nThe substitute measure provided that \"no alien shall acquire title or\r\nown land in the State of California,\" but the provisions of the act\r\nfurther provided that the law \"shall not apply to lands now owned in\r\nthis State by aliens so long as they are held by their present owners.\"\r\n\r\nThe substitute measure was introduced on February 1st; it came up for\r\npassage on February 3rd. In the two days which elapsed between the\r\nintroduction and final action on the bill, the high State authorities\r\ndecided to oppose it. Speaker Phil Stanton employed his influence\r\nagainst it; one by one its supports who could \"be reached\" were \"pulled\r\ndown.\" Drew found himself at the final with slight following. The bill\r\nwas defeated by the decisive vote of 28 to 48. Mott gave notice of\r\nmotion to reconsider, but the next day reconsideration was denied.\r\n\r\nThe day following the defeat of the Alien Land bill, February 4th, the\r\n\"Anti-Japanese School Bill\" and the \"Municipal Segregation Bill\" came up\r\nfor final action. There was also Assembly Bill 15, classed as an\r\nanti-Japanese measure, which came up on the same day. It, as in the case\r\nof the two others, had been introduced by Johnson of Sacramento, by far\r\nthe ablest parliamentarian in the Legislature. Drew had used facts and\r\nfigures when arguing for his alien land bills; Johnson seasoned his\r\nstatistics with a sarcasm[90] as peppery as one of Mr. Roosevelt's\r\ningenuous opinions on \"nature fakers.\" But while Mr. Johnson entertained\r\nwith his wit and his invective, he failed to overcome the tremendous\r\ninfluence, State and Federal, that had been brought to bear against his\r\nbills. Assembly Bill 15, denying aliens the right to serve as directors\r\non California corporations, was defeated by a vote of 15 for to 53\r\nagainst. Assembly Bill 32, the \"Municipal Segregation Bill,\"[91] was\r\ndefeated by the close vote of 39 for to 35 against, 41 votes being\r\nrequired for its passage.\r\n\r\nAnd then the Assembly took another tack, and by a vote of 45 to 29,\r\npassed Assembly Bill 14, the Anti-Japanese School bill. Leeds changed\r\nhis vote from no to aye to give notice that he would the next\r\nlegislative day move to reconsider the vote by which the bill had been\r\npassed. The Assembly then adjourned. The day had been eventful. A more\r\neventful was to follow.\r\n\r\nThe passage of Assembly Bill 14, after the defeat of the other so-called\r\nanti-Japanese measures, brought a characteristic telegram from President\r\nRoosevelt to Governor Gillett. \"This (Assembly Bill 14) is the most\r\noffensive bill of them all,\" telegraphed the President, \"and in my\r\njudgment is clearly unconstitutional, and we should at once have to test\r\nit in the courts. Can it not be stopped in the Legislature or by veto?\"\r\n\r\nGovernor Gillett incorporated that telegram in a message which he sent\r\nto Senate and Assembly the next day. \"A telegram so forcible as this,\"\r\nsaid the Governor, \"from the President of the United States, is entitled\r\nto full consideration, and demands that no hasty or ill-considered\r\naction be taken by this State which may involve the whole country. It\r\nseems to me that it is time to lay sentiment and personal opinion and\r\nconsiderations aside and take a broad and unprejudiced view of the\r\nimportant question involved in the proposed legislation, and in a calm\r\nand dispassionate manner pass upon them, keeping in mind not only the\r\ninterests of our State, but of the Nation as well, and the duty we owe\r\nto it in observing the treaties entered into by it with a friendly\r\npower.\"\r\n\r\n\"I trust,\" concluded the Governor, \"that no action will be taken which\r\nwill violate any treaty made by our country or in any manner question\r\nits good faith. I most respectfully submit this message to you with the\r\nfull hope and belief that when final action shall be taken nothing will\r\nbe done which can be the subject of criticism by the people of this\r\nNation, and that no law will be enacted which will be in contravention\r\nof the Constitution or any treaty of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nThe Governor's message was not at all well received[92]; in fact,\r\nGovernor and message were denounced by both Republican and Democratic\r\nAssemblymen.\r\n\r\n From the hour that the bill had been passed, the Governor had been in\r\nconsultation with his lieutenants in the Assembly. Speaker Stanton made\r\ncanvass of the situation. But little headway was made. That\r\nreconsideration would be denied was evident. Leeds, to save the\r\nsituation, moved that reconsideration be postponed until February 10th.\r\nAn amendment was made that it be re-referred to the Judiciary Committee.\r\nIt was on this amended motion that the issue was fought out.\r\n\r\n\"I know what you want,\" declared Johnson of Sacramento in his opening\r\nspeech, \"and you know it. You want to bury this bill. You want time to\r\nhold another caucus on the question and decide what you will do. You\r\nwant time to take another canvass of this Assembly.\"\r\n\r\nHad the question been put when Johnson had concluded, reconsideration\r\nwould unquestionably have been denied. In the emergency, Speaker Stanton\r\nleft his desk and took the floor to plead for delay. For once in his\r\nlife, at least, Phil Stanton was impressive. He did not say much, - and\r\nas the sequel showed he had little to say - but there was a suggestion\r\nof thundering guns and sacked cities and marching armies in his words,\r\nthat caused the listening statesmen to follow him with unstatesmen-like\r\nuneasiness.\r\n\r\n\"It was not my intention,\" said Stanton, \"to take the floor unless we\r\nwere confronted by some grave crisis. Such a crisis is, in my opinion,\r\nupon us. I not only believe it, but I know it. But my lips are sealed.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would that I could tell you what I know, but I cannot for the\r\npresent. But I can tell you that we are treading upon dangerous ground.\r\nI can feel it slipping from under my feet.\"\r\n\r\n\"In my judgment this matter should be postponed. I believe that further\r\ninformation will, within a few days, be given you.\"\r\n\r\nThe psychological moment had come in the history of Assembly Bill 14.\r\nAll eyes were turned on Johnson of Sacramento. It was for him to say\r\nwhether the postponement asked should be granted. Had Johnson said \"no,\"\r\nsuch was the attitude of the Assembly at that moment, reconsideration of\r\nthe measure would unquestionably have been denied, and Assembly Bill 14\r\ndeclared passed by the House of its origin.\r\n\r\nBut Johnson did not say \"no.\"[93] Instead, he entered upon a rambling\r\nexcuse for advocating acquiescence in Stanton's request for delay. He\r\nrambled on that he believed that Governor Gillett had been indiscreet;\r\nthat he (Johnson) did not propose to be dictated to by a \"fanatical\r\nPresident eternally seeking the limelight.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" concluded Johnson, \"I have listened to the words of our Speaker,\r\nand I see that he is profoundly moved. For this reason I am willing that\r\nthe bill go over until Wednesday, but out of respect to our Speaker, and\r\nfor no one else on earth.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Johnson sat down, one could have heard a pin drop. Not a dissenting\r\nvoice was heard. Further consideration of the measure was postponed\r\nuntil February 10.\r\n\r\nThe day preceding final action on the bill was given over to conferences\r\nand caucuses. The Democrats caucused and agreed to stand as a unit for\r\nthe bill. Grove L. Johnson's immediate followers rallied to its support.\r\nOn the other hand, a conference of those opposing the measure was held\r\nin Governor Gillett's office. Grove L. Johnson is alleged to have been\r\ncalled to the carpet. He was asked to withdraw his support of the\r\nmeasure. Johnson is quoted as replying:\r\n\r\n      \"Show me why I should not support it. Give me the reasons, the facts\r\n      and figures, why Roosevelt has any right to interfere with this\r\n      measure. I want something definite. I have heard these suppositions\r\n      and insinuations for years and years. Let me know, gentlemen, what\r\n      information you have confided to you that should induce me to\r\n      withdraw my support and bow to the telegram from Roosevelt.\"\r\n\r\nThe hour for reconsideration of the bill, 11 a. m. of February 10,\r\narrived with the situation practically unchanged. Assemblyman Transue,\r\nStanton's right hand man in the fight against the bill, presented an\r\nelaborate resolution, laboriously prepared by the opponents of the\r\nmeasure, setting forth why it should be defeated[94]. In it the right of\r\nthe State to pass such school-regulating laws as it may see fit was\r\naffirmed, and the constitutionality of the pending measure alleged, but\r\nthe Assembly was urged to do nothing to disturb the relations existing\r\nbetween this Government and a friendly power. The resolution did not\r\nstrengthen the position of the opponents of the bill in the least. In\r\nfact, several of their number were estranged. So worked up had the\r\nAssemblymen become, that Beardslee of San Joaquin moved that Transue's\r\nresolution be considered in executive session, but the motion was lost.\r\nThe resolution was later withdrawn.\r\n\r\nThe debate turned principally on demands from the supporters of the\r\nbill, that Speaker Stanton tell why he had felt \"the ground slipping\r\nfrom under his feet\" in his speech of six days before. But Stanton\r\nwouldn't or couldn't tell. He leaned on his gavel through it all looking\r\nvery foolish indeed.\r\n\r\nThese speeches of denunciation pleased the supporters of the bill\r\nimmensely, but the luxury of denouncing Stanton defeated the bill. Had\r\nthe vote been taken at the forenoon session, reconsideration would\r\nundoubtedly have been denied. But so much time was taken in making\r\nStanton feel foolish, that the hour of recess arrived, and the Assembly\r\nscattered until two o'clock.\r\n\r\nThis brief respite gave the opponents of the measure a last opportunity.\r\nThey improved it by bringing over to their side enough members of the\r\nSan Francisco delegation to win reconsideration, and the measure's\r\ndefeat. When the Assembly re-convened after the noon recess, the members\r\nby a vote of 43 to 34 granted the bill reconsideration, and by a vote of\r\n37 ayes to 41 noes defeated it[95].\r\n\r\nAlthough the Senate escaped the sensational scenes that attended the\r\nsuppression of the Japanese problem in the Assembly, nevertheless\r\nJapanese bills and resolutions, with attending debates, made their\r\nappearance there. Caminetti, for example, introduced a duplicate of the\r\nJohnson anti-Japanese School bill, which was referred to the Senate\r\nCommittee on Education and never heard from again.\r\n\r\nSenate Bill No. 492, introduced by Senator Anthony, made more trouble.\r\nThis measure gave the people of the State an opportunity to express\r\nthemselves at the polls on the Japanese question. The Committee on\r\nLabor, Capital and Immigration recommended the measure for passage, and\r\nit was finally forced to a vote, being defeated by twelve votes for and\r\ntwenty-two against[96].\r\n\r\nA series of Senate anti-Japanese resolutions which were finally included\r\nin Senate joint Resolution No. 6[97], almost led to a riot in the\r\nAssembly. After a deal of pulling and hauling in the Senate the\r\nresolution was finally adopted and went to the Assembly. In the\r\nAssembly, Speaker Stanton, as \"a select committee of one,\" took the\r\nresolution under his protection. The indications being that the \"select\r\ncommittee of one\" would fail to report, a storm was started by an attack\r\non Stanton's authority to be a \"select committee of one\" at all. The\r\nassailants were repulsed. Nevertheless, \"the select committee of one,\"\r\nafter holding the measure a week, recommended that it be referred to the\r\nCommittee on Federal Relations. The measure was finally adopted and went\r\nto the Governor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[86] The Assembly vote on the four principal Japanese issues will be\r\nfound in Table I of the Appendix.\r\n\r\n[87a] A bill providing funds for such a census was introduced and became\r\na law.\r\n\r\n[87] The paragraph in Governor Gillett's message which deals with the\r\nAlien Land bill, read as follows:\r\n\r\n\"If you believe the general policy of this State and its future\r\ndevelopment demands that all aliens, that is, citizens of other\r\ncountries, should be discouraged in making investments here, and that no\r\nalien should be permitted to become the owner in fee simple of any lands\r\nwithin this State - agricultural, grazing or mineral, or of any city\r\nproperty for the purposes of trade, commerce or manufacturing - then\r\nenact a law forbidding the same, but see to it that it affects the\r\nsubjects of all nations alike, and that under its provisions the\r\ncitizens of Japan shall have equal privileges with those of England\r\nand other favored nations; otherwise you might create a situation which\r\nmay prove to be embarrassing to the Federal Government. Mr. Drew's bill\r\nmight be so amended, but in its present form it clearly, as no doubt was\r\nintended, discriminates against the citizens of China and Japan. Whether\r\nany bill should pass at this time which will discourage foreign capital\r\nfrom seeking investments in our State is a most serious question and one\r\nnot lightly to be considered. But that is a question I leave for you to\r\nsolve.\"\r\n\r\n[88] The Governor's letter was in full as follows:\r\n\r\nHon. A. M. Drew: Your little note was received.\r\n\r\n\"I am inclined to think that the best possible law that can be passed on\r\nthe question of alien ownership of land would be the law adopted by\r\nOklahoma. You will find it in the session laws of the State of Oklahoma,\r\n1907 and 1908. The book is on file in the State Library. The Act is on\r\npage 481.\r\n\r\n\"I would strike out of the first line the words 'who is not a citizen of\r\nthe United States,' because that is useless. No alien is a citizen of\r\nthe United States, and cannot be.\r\n\r\n\"Then I notice the second line of Section 3, instead of having 'devise,'\r\nthe word is 'device.' I suppose this must be a typographical error.\r\n\r\n\"To this bill might be added the last section of your bill, extending\r\nthe time in which leases can be given - so many years on agricultural\r\nproperty and so many years on city property. I think one year is rather\r\nshort; inasmuch as this would apply to all aliens alike, I would be\r\nreasonable as to the length of time for which leases should be granted.\r\n\r\n\"I am also of the opinion that President Roosevelt and Secretary Root\r\nwould agree that this bill would be all right - in fact, I have\r\ntelegrams from them which would indicate such to be the fact. Of course,\r\nthe question whether or not it would be policy to pass an alien law in\r\nthis State is something that the Legislature would have to consider, but\r\nif such a law is to pass, as I say, I am inclined to believe that one\r\nlike the Oklahoma law would probably be the best.\"\r\n\r\n[89] Assemblyman Drew's reply to the Governor's letter suggesting that\r\nthe Oklahoma law be substituted for the original bill, was as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Your esteemed favor of the 26th inst., is before me, and I can assure\r\nyou that I appreciate the spirit in which you have considered the Alien\r\nLand bill, presented by myself in the Assembly. I am strictly in accord\r\nwith the changes you suggest. The words 'who is not a citizen of the\r\nUnited States' are surplusage and could easily have been left out, but\r\nthey are found in both the Illinois and Oklahoma laws. I am glad the\r\nPresident takes the view of the matter that he does, and you may rest\r\nassured that I will work in harmony with yourself. However, I deem it\r\nadvisable that some law should be enacted at this session of the\r\nLegislature. I think it will be wisdom on our part to take this step,\r\nand surely our neighbor, Japan, cannot complain so long as the bill is\r\napplicable to all aliens alike. I will submit to you a draft of the\r\namended bill as soon as I can get it in shape.\"\r\n\r\n[90] Johnson addressed himself directly to President Roosevelt and\r\nGovernor Gillett. The following paragraphs are taken at random from his\r\nspeech:\r\n\r\n\"I expect some member of the Assembly to introduce a bill here, the\r\nfirst section of which shall read: 'Before any legislation is enacted it\r\nshall bear the approval of James N. Gillett and President Roosevelt and\r\nif it is denied, the bill shall be withdrawn.' \"\r\n\r\n\"Some of you think legislation is like patent medicine. It must bear on\r\nthe bill, the label: 'None genuine without the note, This is a good\r\nbill, James N. Gillett.' \"\r\n\r\n\"What right have we, mere Assemblymen, to have an opinion on any matter?\r\nWhy should we, who were sent here by the people for the sake of\r\nconvenience and formality, have any independence in our thought? What\r\nright have we to do anything but listen in awe and reverence to the\r\nwords of wisdom that drop from the tongues of Governor James N. Gillett\r\nand Theodore Roosevelt?\r\n\r\n\"Of course we must surrender our individual opinion, and bow to the\r\nsuperior intellects of the 'Imperial Power,' which Mr. Beardslee loves\r\nso well. Since we must vote, as a matter of course, what right have we\r\nto vote otherwise than as the distinguished Governor and President say\r\nin their infinite certainty?\"\r\n\r\nJohnson complained bitterly of the interference of the President with\r\nthe State and of the Governor with the Legislature.\r\n\r\n\"I have,\" said Johnson, \"all respect for the intellect of James N.\r\nGillett, Governor of California, and for his superior, President\r\nRoosevelt. But I am sent into this Chamber by my constituents and not by\r\nGovernor James N. Gillett. I have been returned here again and again,\r\nand not because I bowed to the authority of James N. Gillett. I am here\r\nfor the good of my people, the people who supported me, and who expect\r\nme to support them. I know more about the Japanese than Governor Gillett\r\nand President Roosevelt put together. I am not responsible to either of\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am responsible to the mothers and fathers of Sacramento County who\r\nhave their little daughters sitting side by side in the school rooms\r\nwith matured Japs, with their base minds, their lascivious thoughts,\r\nmultiplied by their race and strengthened by their mode of life.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am here to protect the children of these parents. To do all that I\r\ncan to keep any Asiatic man from mingling in the same school with the\r\ndaughters of our people. You know the results of such a condition; you\r\nknow how far it will go, and I have seen Japanese 25 years old sitting\r\nin the seats next to the pure maids of California. I shuddered then and\r\nI shudder now, the same as any other parent will shudder to think of\r\nsuch a condition.\"\r\n\r\n[91] The purpose of the Municipal Segregation bill, as set forth in its\r\ntitle, was \"to confer power upon municipalities to protect the health,\r\nmorals and peace of their inhabitants by restricting undesirable,\r\nimproper and unhealthy persons and persons whose practices are dangerous\r\nto public morals and health and peace to certain prescribed limits, and\r\nprescribing a punishment for a violation of this Act.\"\r\n\r\nThe bill in full was as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Section 1. Whenever in the opinion of the governing body of any\r\nmunicipality the presence of undesirable, improper and unhealthy\r\npersons, or the presence of persons whose practices are dangerous to\r\npublic morals and health and peace is deemed to exist in the said\r\nmunicipality and to be dangerous to the public morals and health and\r\npeace of said municipality and its inhabitants, the said governing body\r\nis hereby empowered to so declare by ordinance and is hereby empowered\r\nand authorized to prescribe by ordinance the district and limits within\r\nwhich said persons shall reside in said municipality, and thereafter it\r\nshall be unlawful for any person of the class so declared to reside in\r\nany other portion of said municipality than within the said district and\r\nlimits so fixed.\r\n\r\n\"See. 2. A violation of the provisions of this Act shall be deemed a\r\nmisdemeanor and shall be punished as such.\"\r\n\r\n[92] \"Never before have I heard of a time,\" said Assemblyman Cronin,\r\n\"when a Governor has sent such a message to a Legislature. I am\r\nresponsible to my constituents for my actions on this floor and I resent\r\nsuch interference. I hold the Governor's action to be indiscreet. He has\r\nno more right to send such a message to this House than have we to\r\ndictate to the Supreme Court a policy on any action pending before it,\r\non the ground that the best interests of the State depend upon their\r\nregarding our Instructions.\r\n\r\n\"Can we dictate to the Governor the course that is to be pursued in an\r\nexecutive matter? Let us stand by our guns.\"\r\n\r\n\"If the men change their votes on account of this fanciful talk from the\r\nPresident and the Governor,\" said Johnson of Sacramento, \"I shall\r\ncertainly be pained and surprised. They do not know the conditions as I\r\nknow them. We have a right to protect our State, and it will not\r\ninterfere with any international relations, and they know it. Their\r\nspecious argument will not change my vote one bit. I know what The\r\nPeople want - what I want. I know influence has been brought to bear. It\r\nwill be further brought to bear. Now I trust this vote will not suffer\r\nby you men changing your minds for such groundless reasons.\"\r\n\r\n\"Since yesterday,\" said Assemblyman Gibbons, \"I have changed my views. I\r\nthought there were three departments in this Government, but I find I\r\nwas mistaken. I recognize the error of my youthful belief. I know now\r\nthat the Legislative and the Executive are one, or, rather, that the\r\nExecutive is the Legislative.\"\r\n\r\n[93] The question has been asked - was Johnson sincere in his advocacy\r\nof the Anti-Japanese measures? The writer does not presume to answer;\r\nthe workings of Grove L. Johnson's mind and conscience are, for the\r\nwriter at least, too intricate for analysis. But Grove L. Johnson voted\r\nfor anti-racetrack gambling bills for years, spoke for them and fought\r\nfor them as keenly as he did for the Anti-Japanese bills, always on the\r\nlosing side. But when an anti-racetrack gambling bill was before the\r\nAssembly with some prospect of passage, Grove L. Johnson was found the\r\nleader of those opposed to its passage. In the case in point, to Grove\r\nL. Johnson, and not President Roosevelt or Governor Gillett, or even\r\nPhil Stanton, is due the credit for postponement of consideration of\r\nAssembly Bill 14, a postponement which meant its defeat.\r\n\r\n[94] The Transue resolution will be found in full In the appendix.\r\n\r\n[95] Speaker Stanton very modestly took much credit for the defeat of\r\nthe bill. The following telegram was on its way to Washington almost\r\nbefore the vote had been announced:\r\n\r\n\"Sacramento, February 10.-Theodore Roosevelt, White House Washington, D.\r\nC. - The Assembly just reconsidered and refused passage of the Japanese\r\nSchool bill. My congratulations.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tP. A. STANTON.\"\r\n\r\nThe reply was as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Washington, February 10.-Hon. P. A. Stanton, Speaker of the Assembly,\r\nSacramento, Cal. - Accept my heartiest thanks and congratulations for\r\nthe great service you have rendered on behalf of The People of the\r\nUnited States. I thank the people of California and their\r\nrepresentatives in the Legislature.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTHEODORE ROOSEVELT.\"\r\n\r\nA further telegram was sent to Governor Gillett:\r\n\r\n\"Washington, February 10. - To Governor J. N. Gillett, Sacramento Cal. -\r\nAccept my heartiest congratulations. All good Americans appreciate what\r\nyou have done. Pray extend my congratulations individually to all who\r\nhave aided you. I feel that the way in which California has done what\r\nwas right for the Nation makes it more than ever obligatory on the\r\nNation in every way to safeguard the interests of California. All that I\r\npersonally can do toward this end, whether in public or private life,\r\nshall most certainly be done.\r\n\tTHEODORE ROOSEVELT.\"\r\n\r\n[96] The vote on Senate Bill 492 was as follows:\r\n\r\nFor the bill - Anthony, Black, Burnett, Caminetti, Campbell, Cartwright,\r\nFinn, Hartman, Holohan, Reily, Sanford, and Welch - 12.\r\n\r\nAgainst the bill - Bates, Bell, Bills, Birdsall, Boynton, Curtin,\r\nCutten, Hurd, Leavitt, Lewis, Martinelli, McCartney, Miller, Price,\r\nRush, Savage, Strobridge, Thompson, Walker, Weed, Willis, and Wright -\r\n22.\r\n\r\nAbsentees - Estudillo, Hare, Kennedy, Roseberry, Stetson, and Wolfe - 6.\r\n\r\n[97] Senate Joint Resolution No. 6, which, as finally adopted, was a\r\ncommittee substitute for Senate Joint Resolution Nos. 6, 7, 11 and 17.\r\nIt follows:\r\n\r\nWhereas, The progress, happiness, and prosperity of the people of a\r\nnation depend upon a homogeneous population;\r\n\r\nWhereas, The influx from overpopulated nations of Asia of people who are\r\nunsuited for American citizenship or for assimilation with the Caucasian\r\nrace, has resulted and will result in lowering the American standard of\r\nlife and the dignity and wage-earning capacity of American labor;\r\n\r\nWhereas, The exclusion of Chinese laborers under the existing exclusion\r\nlaws of the United States has tended to preserve the economic and social\r\nwelfare of the people;\r\n\r\nWhereas, We view with alarm any proposed repeal of such exclusion laws\r\nand the substituting therefor of general laws;\r\n\r\nWhereas, The interest of California can best be safeguarded by the\r\nretention of said exclusion laws, and by extending their terms and\r\nprovisions to other Asiatic people;\r\n\r\nWhereas, The people of the Eastern states, and the United States\r\ngenerally, have an erroneous impression as to the real sentiment of the\r\npeople of the Pacific Coast relative to the Asiatic question;\r\n\r\nWhereas, We think it right and proper that the people of this country\r\nshould be advised as to our true position on that question; therefore,\r\nbe it\r\n\r\nResolved, by the Senate and Assembly jointly, That we respectfully urge\r\nthe Congress of the United States to maintain intact the present Chinese\r\nexclusion laws and instead of taking any action looking to the repeal of\r\nsaid exclusion laws, to extend the terms and provisions thereof so as to\r\napply to and include all Asiatics;\r\n\r\nResolved, That our Senators be instructed and Representatives in\r\nCongress requested to use all honorable means to carry out the foregoing\r\nrecommendation and requests;\r\n\r\nResolved, That the Governor of California be, and he is, directed to\r\ntransmit a certified copy of these resolutions to the President and\r\nSpeaker, respectively, of the Senate and House of Representatives of the\r\nUnited States, and to each of our Senators and Representatives in\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nThe resolution was adopted in the Senate by the following vote:\r\n\r\nAyes - Senators Anthony, Bates, Bills, Birdsall, Black, Boynton,\r\nBurnett, Caminetti, Campbell, Cartwright, Curtin, Cutten, Finn, Hare,\r\nHartman, Holohan, Kennedy, Leavitt, Lewis, McCartney, Miller, Reily,\r\nRush, Sanford, Savage, Walker, Welch, and Wolfe - 28.\r\n\r\nNoes - Senators Bell, Price, Roseberry, Stetson, Thompson, Weed, and\r\nWillis - 7.\r\n\r\nThe resolution was adopted in the Assembly on March 23. There was no\r\ncall for the ayes and noes, and no record was made of the vote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXI.\r\n\r\nThe Rule Against Lobbying.\r\n\r\nScandals of the Session of 1907 and the Dread of Pinkerton Detectives\r\nLed to a Rule Under Which Machine Lobbyists Could Work with Perfect\r\nSafety, While Advocates of Reform Measures Could Be Barred From Both\r\nSenate and Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the principal scandals of the Legislative session of 1907 was the\r\nopenness with which machine lobbyists invaded Senate and Assembly\r\nchamber. They went so far as to move from member to member during\r\nroll-calls, giving Senator or Assemblyman, as the case might be, a\r\nproprietary tap on the shoulder, to direct his vote.\r\n\r\nWord of the scandal got as far away from Sacramento as San Luis Obispo\r\nCounty, where A. E. Campbell became a candidate for the Senate against\r\nH. W. Lynch, largely on the machine issue. Campbell pledged himself ,to\r\ndenounce such lobbyists as Jere Burke, the Southern Pacific attorney, if\r\nthey appeared on the floor of the Senate, and to have them ejected from\r\nthe chamber.\r\n\r\nWhen Campbell reached Sacramento he let it be known that such would be\r\nhis policy. Campbell is thickset and shaggy of eyebrow; his beard shows\r\nblack on his face two hours after shaving. He has all the earmarks of a\r\nborn fighter. He didn't look good to the machine, and his words didn't\r\nsound good. Incidentally, Jere Burke discreetly kept out of the Senate\r\nchamber while the Senate was in session.\r\n\r\nAnother thing which gave machine members of both Houses, as well as\r\nmachine hangers-on, much concern, was the rumor started along in\r\nDecember that certain public-spirited citizens of Los Angeles and San\r\nFrancisco would maintain at the Capital during the session a lobby to\r\nprotect the interests of the people, just as the machine lobby looks\r\nafter the well-being of machine-protected corporations and individuals.\r\n\r\nThis rumor caused great distress. It had all sorts of versions. One\r\nstory was that a corps of Pinkertons would be employed to look for bugs\r\nin bills, boodle in sacks, and boodle-itching palms. Another account had\r\nit that the supervision was to be carried on by the San Francisco graft\r\nprosecution, and that Burns men would be in constant attendance. A\r\nreport, started early in the session, that a Burns detective had secured\r\na job as Assembly clerk almost threw that body into hysterics.\r\n\r\nCampbell's threats and the anti-machine lobby rumors seem to have had\r\ntheir effect upon the Committee on Rules of each House. At any rate,\r\nboth Senate and Assembly adopted rules that no person engaged in\r\npresenting any business to the Legislature or its Committees should be\r\npermitted to do business with a member while the House to which the\r\nmember belonged was in session. Persons transgressing this rule were to\r\nbe removed from the floor of the House in which the offense was\r\ncommitted, and kept out during the remainder of the session.\r\n\r\nThe rule was employed in one instance only. George Baker Anderson, of\r\nThe People's Legislative Bureau, was ruled out of the Assembly, and, in\r\neffect, out of the Senate Chamber. Jere Burke kept away from both, but\r\nit was probably Campbell's threat more than the rule that influenced\r\nBurke. With these two exceptions, the lobbyists had pretty much the run\r\nof both chambers. It should be said, however, that while none of those\r\nlobbyists were threatened with expulsion from the floor of either House\r\nfor advocating machine-backed measures and policies, persons advocating\r\nreform measures were threatened with the anti-lobbying rules. But\r\nAnderson was the only one to suffer because of them.\r\n\r\nThe curious feature of Anderson's case was that nobody seems to have\r\nbeen able to discover that he ever did any lobbying, or asked a member\r\nof either body to support or oppose any measure or policy, or that he\r\neven so much as spoke to a legislator while the House to which the\r\nlegislator belonged was in session.\r\n\r\nAnderson was in charge of a Legislative Bureau, one purpose of which was\r\nto keep the newspapers of the State which were not represented by\r\ncorrespondents at the Capital, informed of the votes on the various\r\nmeasures, and other items of importance or interest. Somebody early in\r\nthe session called the bureau a \"lobby,\" and somebody else improved the\r\ntitle by calling it \"People's Lobby.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then certain Senators and Assemblymen awoke to the startling\r\ndiscovery that in the Legislative Bureau, presided over by Anderson, was\r\nthe People's Lobby that was to employ Pinkerton's or Burns' men to watch\r\nthe Legislature. Anderson was a marked man from that moment.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough this theory of Anderson's purpose didn't anger a single\r\nmember of Senate or Assembly who, during the nearly three months that\r\nfollowed, voted against machine-advocated measures, and for measures\r\nwhich the machine opposed. Assemblymen of the type of Bohnett, Hinkle,\r\nCattell, Callan and Drew, Senators like Bell, Black, Campbell and\r\nHolohan either treated the Pinkerton story as a joke or thought that a\r\nlittle Pinkerton watchfulness might be a pretty good proposition, all\r\nthings considered.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, many of the Senators and Assemblymen who were in\r\nconstant opposition to reform policies, were very much exercised that\r\nanybody should have the audacity to have a watch kept upon the\r\nLegislature. This intense feeling found perhaps its best expression in\r\nAssemblyman McManus' denunciation of Anderson, when the question of\r\nhaving Anderson \"investigated\" was before the Assembly.\r\n\r\n\"It is a sad state of affairs,\" said McManus, \"if a band of Pinkertons\r\nare here to follow the members up. We aren't everyday street-car\r\nconductors. We don't have to have spotters to watch us.\"\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the most astonishing feature of the whole astonishing\r\nAnderson incident is that nobody was ever able to connect him with a\r\ndetective of any stripe whatsoever, Burns, Pinkerton, or unclassified.\r\nBut this did not prevent his being ruled off the floor of the Assembly,\r\nand, in effect, of the Senate.\r\n\r\nAs the most amazing rumors about Anderson - many started as jokes[98] -\r\nmultiplied, the indignation of certain Assemblymen and Senators\r\nincreased. Matters came to a climax when Anderson sent a number of\r\nletters to members who had been absent from the chamber when the first\r\nvote was taken on the Walker-Otis Anti-Gambling bill, asking them if\r\nthey would be willing to give the reasons for their absence.\r\n\r\nThe difference in the effect of the letters was astonishing. Assemblyman\r\nPrescott F. Cogswell, who had been favored with one of them, stated on\r\nthe floor of the Assembly that he had been glad of the opportunity to\r\nmake known the cause of his absence when the vote was taken. On the\r\nother hand, Assemblyman Wheelan, who had received a duplicate of the\r\nletter which Cogswell had welcomed, was very much cast down. Wheelan,\r\narising to a question of personal privilege, read the letter, and wanted\r\nto know if he hadn't been \"insulted[99].\"\r\n\r\nAssemblyman Beardslee hastened to assure Mr. Wheelan that he had been.\r\nFurthermore, Beardslee thumped his ample chest a thump, and announced:\r\n\r\n\"I, too, am insulted, for my brother has been insulted, and who insults\r\nmy brother, insults me.\"\r\n\r\nThat seemed to settle it. The Committee on Rules was instructed to\r\ninvestigate the letter incident.\r\n\r\nThe Committee on Rules consisted of Johnston of Contra Costa, Transue,\r\nGrove L. Johnson, Beardslee and Stanton, the Committee, by the way, of\r\n\"gag rules\" notoriety. The investigation was held behind closed doors.\r\n\r\nAnderson was asked about the letter and his purpose in writing it, to\r\nall of which he replied directly and without hesitation. And then came\r\nthe burning question of the hour:\r\n\r\n\"How many Pinkertons are there in your employ in Sacramento, Mr.\r\nAnderson?\" asked Johnson.\r\n\r\nAnderson refused to answer the question. His wiser course would perhaps\r\nhave been to answer truthfully, \"None at all,\" and end the joke. But\r\nthat was Anderson's business. He declined to answer.\r\n\r\nAnderson's refusal to answer was solemnly reported by the committee back\r\nto the Assembly. Some members when the report was read laughed, others\r\nwere made very serious indeed. It was finally decided that the\r\ninvestigation of Anderson should be turned over to the Judiciary\r\nCommittee, of which Grove L. Johnson was chairman.\r\n\r\nThe Judiciary Committee was solemnly authorized to send for persons and\r\npapers, and administer oaths. While the investigation was pending,\r\nAnderson was denied admittance to the Assembly chamber. As the press\r\nbadge, admitting Anderson to both Assembly and Senate chambers had been\r\ntaken from him, he was unable to enter the Senate chamber either.\r\n\r\nAnd the Assembly Judiciary Committee failed to investigate. Although\r\nAnderson demanded that he be given a hearing, and the matter settled,\r\none way or the other, the Judiciary Committee would not and did not act.\r\nUnder the Assembly resolution ordering the investigation, however,\r\nAnderson was for nearly two months barred from both the Assembly and\r\nSenate chambers. The session closed without the investigation being\r\nheld.\r\n\r\nIt may be said in this connection that neither in the State Statutes,\r\nnor in the rules of either Senate or Assembly, is there a word which\r\nprohibits the employing of detectives at a Legislative session. Even\r\nthough Johnson's committee had investigated Anderson's case, and\r\ndiscovered that he was really employing detectives, it is difficult to\r\nsee how his punishment could have been justified. The incident is\r\ncertainly one of the most extraordinary of the session - of any\r\nLegislative session ever held in this State, in fact.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting point in the Anderson case was that when pinned\r\ndown for a reason for excluding him from the Assembly chamber, the\r\noffended Assemblyman would invariably reply that he was excluded under\r\nthe rule which prohibited lobbying.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, however, lobbying, in spite of the rule, continued on\r\nthe floors of both Houses even during sessions.\r\n\r\nWhen the Islais Creek Harbor bill was under consideration in the\r\nAssembly, for example, Carroll Cook, and others interested in the defeat\r\nof the measure as it had passed the Senate, appeared openly on the floor\r\nand in the lobby of the Assembly, even when the debate was going on, and\r\nworked for amendment of the measure to suit their aims. All this\r\nresulted in the greatest confusion. But Speaker Stanton seemed\r\nabsolutely unable to cope with the situation. The lobbying and the\r\nconfusion continued in spite of Stanton's efforts to enforce something\r\nof the appearance of order.\r\n\r\nSuch scenes were often duplicated in the Senate. When the fight over the\r\nDirect Primary bill had the Senate by the ears, Johnnie Lynch, George\r\nVan Smith, even President of the Senate Warren Porter, exerted\r\nthemselves to compel concurrence in the machine-backed Assembly\r\namendments. This was done in the Senate chamber, when the Senate was in\r\nsession, and Johnnie Lynch and Van Smith in particular were conspicuous\r\nin the work in behalf of the machine's policy.\r\n\r\nBut it was noticeable, that those who advocated reform policies took no\r\nsuch liberties on the floor of either House. They knew better. The\r\ndanger involved for the lobbyist for reform measures was emphasized the\r\nnight the measure prohibiting the sale of intoxicants within a mile and\r\na half of Stanford University passed the Assembly.\r\n\r\nCharles R. Detrick of Palo Alto, during the call of the House ordered on\r\naccount of the Stanford bill, was discussing the merits of the measure\r\nwith Assemblyman Bohnett, who was leading the fight for its passage. It\r\nwas not a case of lobbying at all, for both men were for the bill,\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Assemblyman Schmitt[99a], who overheard Detrick mention\r\nthe measure, warned the Stanford man, that if he (Detrick) did not cease\r\nhis \"lobbying\" for the bill that he (Schmitt) would have him (Detrick)\r\nexcluded from the chamber.\r\n\r\nSenator Walker, although a member of the Senate, had much the same\r\nexperience. Walker was discussing the Stanford bill with a friend, when\r\none of the opponents of the measure threatened him with expulsion from\r\nthe floor of the Assembly if he did not desist.\r\n\r\nAnd even while these threats were being made against the proponents of\r\nthe bill, opponents of the measure were working openly on the floor of\r\nthe Assembly chamber against its passage. No suggestion was made that\r\nthe rule prohibiting lobbying be enforced against them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[98] A party of newspapermen were in Anderson's office one evening, when\r\ntwo or three machine men came in. With a wink to Anderson one of the\r\nnewspapermen asked - \"The head of your detective bureau is that keen\r\nlooking young fellow, with reddish brown hair and brown eyes, is he not,\r\nAnderson?\" Anderson joined in the Joke and nodded. One of the machine\r\nmen left the room immediately. Within an hour, a hunt was being made\r\nfrom one end of Sacramento to the other, for a \"keen-looking young man\r\nwith reddish brown hair and brown eyes.\"\r\n\r\n[99] The communication which insulted Wheelan read as follows:\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Albert P. Wheelan,\r\n     Member of Assembly.\r\n\r\nDear Sir: -\r\n\r\nThe People's Legislative Bureau, organized chiefly for the collection\r\nand dissemination of accurate information regarding legislation, and the\r\nattitude of members of the Legislature thereon, notes that you are\r\nrecorded as having been absent when the roll was called on the motion to\r\nrefer the Anti-Racetrack Gambling bill back to the committee.\r\n\r\nAs our record is intended to be permanent, and will be placed in the\r\nhands of all the newspapers and civic organizations throughout the\r\nState, we wish to ask if you have any objection to furnishing us the\r\nreason for your absence, so that we may enter it upon our record.\r\nRespectfully yours,\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGEORGE B. ANDERSON,\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSecretary.\r\n\r\n[99a] This is the same Schmitt who objected so strenuously to professors\r\nof the State University being identified with reform movements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXII.\r\n\r\nThe Machine Lobbyist At Work.\r\n\r\nHow, Jere Burke Arrayed the County Officials of the State Against Two\r\nBeneficial Measures - How the Power of the Southern Pacific Was Employed\r\nAgainst a California Enterprise - Danger Which Constantly Menaces\r\nLegitimate Enterprises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe problem of drawing the line between legitimate and reprehensible\r\nlobbying has perplexed wiser men than sat in the California Legislature\r\nof 1909.\r\n\r\nOn the side of the lobbyist it may be said there seems no good reason\r\nwhy a citizen or representative of a corporation which is interested in\r\npending legislation should not appear at the Capitol and in a legitimate\r\nway present his case to the members of the Legislature. In fact, the\r\ntheory of committee consideration of measures introduced in Senate or\r\nAssembly, is based on the principle that it is the citizen's right to be\r\nheard on any matter that may be pending before the Legislature. The\r\ncitizen cannot be heard before either the Senate or Assembly; he can,\r\nhowever, present his case to the committee the decision of which carries\r\nweight with that branch of the Legislature for which it acts. No one can\r\nobject, for example, that Mr. P. F. Dunne appeared before the Senate\r\nCommittee on Corporations, when the Railroad Regulation bill was under\r\nconsideration, to present the railroad's side. Mr. Dunne appeared openly\r\nand aboveboard, and although he sought deliberately to misrepresent the\r\nsituation to the Committee, nevertheless to object to his visiting\r\nSacramento, or even to the work which he did while there, would be\r\nforced and far-fetched.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, Mr. Seth Mann, representing the shippers of California,\r\nappeared before the Committee and presented the side of the shippers.\r\nMr. Mann spoke for the shippers precisely as Mr. Dunne spoke for the\r\nrailroads. Mr. Mann, however, did not stoop to misrepresentation and\r\ndeception.\r\n\r\nBut if Mr. Dunne for the railroads or Mr. Mann for the shippers had\r\ndeparted from openly-presented argument to buttonhole Senators or\r\nAssemblymen to tell them they must vote for or against a given measure,\r\nor look out for trouble, immediately would he be open to criticism. If\r\neither went during roll call from Legislator to Legislator to tell the\r\nmembers how they were to vote, again would he be justly criticized. Or\r\nhad Mr. Dunne employed the influence of the great corporation which he\r\nrepresents to defeat or pass a measure in which his company can have no\r\nlegitimate interest, again would there be good reason for complaint. Mr.\r\nDunne could very properly - while acting as agent of the Southern\r\nPacific Railroad Company - urge in a legitimate way the corporation's\r\nobjections to the Demurrage bill, to the Full Crew bill, to the Railroad\r\nRegulation bill, or any other measure affecting common carriers. But for\r\nMr. Dunne to have employed the influence of his position as political\r\nrepresentative of a common carrier to force the passage of the Change of\r\nVenue bill for example, or defeat an effective Direct Primary bill, or\r\nthe Party Circle bill, or the Judicial Column bill, would have been most\r\nreprehensible, for the Southern Pacific Company can have no legitimate\r\ninterest in any of these measures.\r\n\r\nSo far as the writer knows, Mr. Dunne did not concern himself with any\r\nmeasure, except those in which his company was legitimately interested.\r\nBut paid servants of the Southern Pacific Company were at Sacramento\r\nthroughout the entire session, and managed to have their fingers in\r\nabout all that was going on. The most conspicuous of them was Mr. J. T.\r\nBurke, more familiarly known as \"Jere\" Burke.\r\n\r\nA fair sample of Burke's methods - and Burke is merely typical of the\r\nobjectionable lobbyist - is found in the campaign which was carried on\r\nagainst Senate Bills 1229 and 1230. Had these measures become laws, it\r\nwould have been possible for county assessors to discover property,\r\nowned principally by public service corporations, which at present\r\nescapes taxation. It is estimated that the total taxable value of this\r\nuntaxed property is $100,000,000. It is not taxed because assessors have\r\nno means of reaching it. Mr. Burke's company could have no legitimate\r\ninterest in Senate Bills 1229 and 1230. This statement is made, of\r\ncourse, on the assumption that the officials of the Southern Pacific\r\nCompany aim to make honest returns to the tax collector. But to return\r\nto Senate Bills 1229 and 1230, and Burke's connection with them.\r\n\r\nThe two measures were intended to amend sections of the Codes relating\r\nto the assessment of property. Section 3681 of the Political Code\r\nprovides that \"during the session of the Board (of Supervisors sitting\r\nas a Board of Equalization) it may direct the Assessor to assess any\r\ntaxable property that has escaped assessment, or to add to the amount,\r\nnumber and quality of property, when a false or incompetent list has\r\nbeen rendered.\"\r\n\r\nUnder this section, as it at present reads, the Supervisors may direct\r\nthe Assessor to assess property that may have escaped assessment, but\r\nthere is no machinery provided by which the property may be discovered.\r\nSenate Bill 1229 provided the machinery by which the unassessed property\r\nmight be discovered, by adding to the section quoted above: \"And the\r\nBoard (the Supervisors sitting as a Board of Equalization) may employ\r\nlegal or other assistance in discovering any taxable property that has\r\nescaped assessment in the performance of their duties under this\r\nsection.\"\r\n\r\nSenate Bill 1230, the companion bill, provided that the Supervisors may\r\nsubpena witnesses in all matters pending before them when sitting as a\r\nBoard of Equalization. Under the present law, they can compel attendance\r\nof witnesses only upon the particular point under consideration.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of the amendments was generally admitted. The task of the\r\nAssessor is at best no easy one. Through his deputies he must list all\r\nthe property in his county - that he can find.\r\n\r\nThe holdings of the small property owners are in sight, and, down to the\r\nlast chicken, go on the assessment roll.\r\n\r\nThe property of the large corporation is not so readily discovered and\r\n$100,000,000 worth of it, according to conservative estimate, escapes\r\nassessment. The Assessors, with comparatively small force of deputies,\r\nhave no way to force its assessment.\r\n\r\nThe Board of Supervisors, sitting as a Board of Equalization, may know\r\nthat the unassessed property is in existence, but has no way to reach\r\nit. The Board may, under section 3681 of the Political Code quoted\r\nabove, direct the Assessor to assess it, but the law stops there. There\r\nis no machinery provided for the discovery of the property. Senate Bills\r\n1229 and 1230 provided the machinery. They were introduced by Senator\r\nSanford of Mendocino. Before their significance was appreciated by\r\nSouthern Pacific lobbyists, the Senate Judiciary Committee had\r\nrecommended them for passage.\r\n\r\nWhen Burke did grasp the significance of the measures, he demanded of\r\nSanford that they be withdrawn. The argument which Burke advanced\r\nagainst them was in effect as follows:\r\n\r\n\"These bills are the most un-American propositions I ever heard of,\"\r\nsaid Burke. \"They make of the Boards of Supervisors inquisitorial\r\nbodies. The corporations have property which they prefer to conceal.\r\nThey prefer arbitrary assessments. They do not care to make returns to\r\nthe Assessor. The passage of these bills would compel them to make\r\nreturns.\"\r\n\r\nIn other words, the corporations, if Jere Burke, their legislative\r\nrepresentative, reflects their sentiments, prefer that the Assessors\r\ncontinue to guess at the value of their properties. If the guess be too\r\nhigh, the corporations can compel reductions; if the guess be too low,\r\nthey rest content. But, however the corporations may approve the\r\nguessing method of assessment, it has not proved equable, has not been\r\nfair to the farmer, the merchant and the householder, who under oath\r\nmake honest returns to the Assessor.\r\n\r\nBurke's argument, however, failed to move Sanford. The Senator from\r\nMendocino refused to withdraw the bills. And then a curious thing\r\nhappened. The members of the Senate were, within three days after\r\nSanford had refused to withdraw the bills, fairly swamped with telegrams\r\nand letters from County Assessors and County Supervisors, protesting\r\nagainst the passage of the bills, on the ground that their passage would\r\nbe a reflection upon the County Assessors of the State. Many who thus\r\ntelegraphed or wrote, stated that they had not seen the bills but added\r\nin effect, \"We understand that they are bad bills and should be\r\ndefeated.\"\r\n\r\nOf course, there was no evidence that Burke or his agents had instigated\r\nthe telegrams. But there was a shrewd suspicion that such was the case.\r\nSanford's answer to the Supervisors and Assessors was most effective. He\r\nmailed them copies of the Sacramento Bee which set forth the actual\r\npurpose of the bills, and copies of the bills themselves. Immediately\r\nAssessors and Supervisors who had wired their Senators to oppose the\r\nbills, sent telegrams withdrawing their opposition.\r\n\r\nIn passing it may be said that neither bill passed the Senate. Bill No.\r\n1229 passed second reading, but was amended on third reading, March 11,\r\nand was not heard of again. Bill No. 1230 passed second reading, but was\r\nnot read the third time. There are other ways to kill good bills than to\r\nbluff their authors into withdrawing them, or by stirring up State-wide\r\nantagonism to them. The incident shows, however, the State-wide\r\nramifications of the machine. Within three days it was possible for the\r\nmachine to create the impression from one end of the State to the other,\r\nthat Senate Bills 1229 and 1230 were bad bills, measures casting\r\nreflection upon the County Assessors. Only the prompt action of Senator\r\nSanford dispelled this impression. It also demonstrates the powerful\r\nbacking behind the machine agents kept at Sacramento during a\r\nLegislative session.\r\n\r\nIt is bad enough when the far-reaching influence of the machine is\r\nemployed to defeat measures which provide the machinery to enable public\r\nofficials to enforce the law, against beneficiaries of the system, but\r\nwhen one of the agents employs this influence to promote his personal\r\ninterests in a matter in which the particular corporation which he\r\nrepresents can have no interest whatever, particular emphasis is given\r\nthe evils of the machine domination and reprehensible lobbying. To\r\nillustrate:\r\n\r\nA peculiar situation which has developed at Owens Lake in Inyo County,\r\nmade it necessary and proper that slight amendment be made to the law of\r\neminent domain. The water of Owens Lake is heavily charged with soda.\r\nSome years ago, the Inyo Development Company was organized to recover\r\nthis soda. The company invested $200,000 in establishing a soda-ash\r\nplant at the lakeside. This does not include the cost of building a\r\nrailroad from the Lake to Mound House, Nevada, a distance of about 400\r\nmiles. The investment proved a success. The company harvests as high as\r\n10,000 tons of soda ash a year. As the product is worth as high as $30 a\r\nton at San Francisco, the enterprise adds an important industry to the\r\ndeveloped resources of the State. The method of recovering the soda is\r\nsimple. The water is drawn from the lake into vats, where it is left to\r\nevaporate. The soda is then recovered.\r\n\r\nOwing to the fact that the waters of Owens Lake are constantly receding,\r\na considerable strip of land has, during recent years, been uncovered\r\nbetween the company's holdings near the lake. and the water. The water\r\nfrom which the soda is reclaimed has to be piped over this land.\r\n\r\nRecently former employees of the Inyo Development Company took up the\r\nland lying between the company's property and the lake, and under the\r\nname of the Natural Soda Products Company, propose to go into the\r\nbusiness of manufacturing soda ash on their own account.\r\n\r\nNot long since the new company began to complain of the old company's\r\npipe, which crosses the new company's land. The old company saw that it\r\nhad trouble ahead unless it could condemn a strip of the recently\r\nreclaimed land for a pipe line. It was found, however, that there is no\r\nlaw in California by which this could be done. Under the law of eminent\r\ndomain land could be condemned for almost any other purpose than to\r\nestablish a pipe line to carry water not to be used for irrigation or\r\ndomestic purposes. An attempt was therefore made to have the law\r\ngoverning eminent domain amended so as to read that land could be\r\ncondemned \"for oil pipe lines and pipe lines for conducting the waters\r\nof any lake which are not fit for irrigation or domestic purposes, and\r\nwhich contain soda or other minerals' or chemical substances in\r\nsolution, and also pumps and machinery for raising the same and forcing\r\nthe same through such pipes.\"\r\n\r\nThis amendment was included in Senate Bill 797, and in the companion\r\nAssembly Bill 815. Senate Bill 797 passed the Senate and was referred to\r\nthe Judiciary Committee of the Assembly, where the amendment providing\r\nfor the soda water pipe line was added. This bill received a favorable\r\nrecommendation from the Assembly Judiciary Committee and was returned to\r\nthe Assembly. And then a very mysterious thing happened. Without\r\napparent reason the bill was referred to the Assembly Committee on\r\nCorporations. Provision for soda water pipe lines, so far as the\r\nAssembly was concerned, came to a sudden ending.\r\n\r\nAt the time Senate Bill 797 was undergoing suppression in the Assembly,\r\nthe companion bill, Assembly Bill 815, was pending before the Senate\r\nJudiciary Committee. The measure was amended to make possible the\r\ncondemnation of land for a soda water pipe line. Chairman Willis of the\r\nCommittee expressed himself as satisfied with the amendment. And as\r\namended, the bill was referred back to the Senate with the\r\nrecommendation that it do pass as amended. Two days later, however,\r\nSenator Willis stated on the floor of the Senate that he had information\r\nfrom Inyo County which convinced him that the amendment was not\r\ndesirable, and should be excluded from the bill. He stated that the\r\ncounty officials of Inyo County opposed the amendment, and for that\r\nreason suggested that the amendment be dropped. He stated that the\r\nAssembly would refuse to concur in the amendment even though the bill\r\nwere passed with it. Mr. Willis' wishes were respected and the bill\r\nre-amended. Provisions for condemning land for soda water pipe lines\r\ncame to as dead a stop in the Senate as in the Assembly. The next\r\ndevelopment in this comparatively unimportant incident of the session,\r\nwas the discovery that Mr. J. T. Burke of Berkeley, member of the\r\nSouthern Pacific law department, the Jere Burke of Southern Pacific\r\nlobbying, is one of the directors of the Natural Soda Products Company,\r\nwhich owns the land over which the Inyo Development Company would build\r\na pipe line, a pipe line upon which the future prosperity of the Inyo\r\nDevelopment Company largely rests. Burke was alleged to have opposed the\r\namendment - and so far as the writer knows the charge was never denied -\r\nand with having brought about the defeat of the amendment. In other\r\nwords, Mr. Burke is charged with throwing the full weight of the\r\ninfluence of the large corporation (the Southern Pacific Railroad\r\nCompany, which he represents) on the side of a small corporation in\r\nwhich he is a director, and against a third corporation, which has large\r\ninterests at stake. And the citizen who stands for fair play should not\r\nlose sight of the fact that Mr. Burke's corporation, the Southern\r\nPacific Railroad Company, is the principal factor in the machine which\r\nworks against good government, fair play, the \"square deal\" in business\r\nand politics which President Roosevelt insisted upon. The Inyo\r\nDevelopment Company failed in its perfectly legitimate purpose because\r\narrayed against it was in effect the political influence of the Southern\r\nPacific Railroad Company, the tenderloin, and all the other elements\r\nthat go to make up the political machine in California. And the fact\r\nshould not be lost sight of that no other independent enterprise in\r\nCalifornia, even where it has, as has the Inyo Development Company,\r\nhundreds of thousands of dollars invested, is immune against similar\r\nexperiences.\r\n\r\nEarly in the session when the lobbying question was, because of the\r\nexcitement over Anderson, decidedly prominent, Sanford in the Senate and\r\nCallan in the Assembly introduced bills requiring lobbyists who appear\r\nat the Capitol during a legislative session to register their names, the\r\nnames of their employers and the amount and nature of their compensation.\r\nAt the close of the session they were, under the terms of the measures,\r\nrequired to file a detailed statement of their expenditures.\r\n\r\nHad these measures become laws they might have proved very embarrassing\r\nto certain gentlemen who were very well received by the machine element\r\nin both Senate and Assembly chamber.\r\n\r\nBut they didn't become laws.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly bill went to the Assembly Judiciary Committee, which held\r\nit two months, finally, on March 16th, reporting it to the Assembly\r\nwithout recommendation. On March 19th, the measure was refused passage.\r\n\r\nThe Senate bill went to the Senate Judiciary Committee. The Committee\r\nreferred it back to the Senate with the recommendation that it do not\r\npass. On January 29th, it, too, was defeated.\r\n\r\nThe lobbying problem, like Jere Burke, continues with us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXIII.\r\n\r\nInfluence of the San Francisco Delegation.\r\n\r\nCasts Nearly Twenty-five Per Cent of the Vote in Each House - Majority\r\nInvariably Found on the Side of the Machine - Opposed Passage of the\r\nWalker-Otis Bill - Instrumental in Amending the Direct Primary Law -\r\nDefeated Local Option Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe popular idea that the State outside San Francisco is not concerned\r\nabout political conditions at the metropolis is not borne out by the\r\nrecord of the legislative session of 1909. The San Francisco delegations\r\nin Senate and Assembly had, as they always have had and will have for\r\nmany a year to come, the deciding voice in practically all important\r\nissues.\r\n\r\nSan Francisco elects within one of 25 per cent of the members of the\r\nState Senate, and within two of 25 per cent of the Assembly. In other\r\nwords, nine of the forty Senators come from San Francisco, and eighteen\r\nof the eighty Assemblymen. The nine San Francisco Senators and the\r\neighteen San Francisco Assemblymen join with the outside members in\r\nmaking laws not for San Francisco alone, but for the entire State. Their\r\nnumbers give them decided advantage. The character of the laws passed at\r\na legislative session almost invariably bears the stamp of the character\r\nof the San Francisco delegation. The character of the delegation depends\r\nupon political conditions at San Francisco. The whole State, then, is\r\nconcerned in the efforts of the best citizenship of the metropolis to\r\noust from power the corrupt element that has so long dominated San\r\nFrancisco politics.\r\n\r\nThe record of the San Francisco delegation at the session of 1909, while\r\nbetter in the Assembly than in the Senate, is not one for San Francisco\r\n- or the State for that matter - to enthuse over. The votes on test\r\nquestions of the eighteen members of the Assembly and of the nine\r\nmembers of the Senate, will be found set forth in tables in the\r\nappendix.\r\n\r\nThe table showing the votes of the nine San Francisco Senators covers\r\nsixteen roll calls, on which the San Francisco Senators cast 128 votes,\r\nninety-nine of which were in support of machine policies and only\r\ntwenty-nine against. Thus the nine Senators averaged on sixteen roll\r\ncalls, eleven votes for the machine and three votes against. Had the San\r\nFrancisco Senators broken even on the issues involved; that is to say,\r\nhad sixty-four of the 128 votes been cast for the machine, and\r\nsixty-four against the machine, and the sixty-four anti-machine votes\r\nbeen evenly distributed among the several issues, the machine would have\r\nbeen defeated on every issue coming before the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly showing is not quite so overwhelmingly machine as that of\r\nthe Senate, but it is bad enough. Eleven roll calls are considered. On\r\nthese the eighteen San Francisco Assemblymen cast a total of 165 votes,\r\nof which 108 were for machine policies and fifty-seven against. Thus,\r\neven in the Assembly, the vote was approximately 2 to 1 in favor of the\r\nmachine. Of the fifty-seven anti-machine votes, eleven were cast by\r\nCallan, who made an absolutely clean record, nine by Gerdes and seven by\r\nLightner, a total of twenty-seven for the three. Deducted from the total\r\nof anti-machine votes, this leaves only thirty anti-machine votes for\r\nthe remaining fifteen members of the delegation. Or to put it the other\r\nway, Callan, Gerdes and Lightner cast among them only four machine\r\nvotes, which leaves 104 machine votes cast by the other fifteen San\r\nFrancisco members.\r\n\r\nOn the individual issues the San Francisco Senators and Assemblymen made\r\nas bad a showing as does their vote in the aggregate. The passage of the\r\nWalker-Otis Racetrack Gambling bill for example demonstrates that the\r\npoolsellers had little hold upon the legislators of any community of the\r\nState outside of San Francisco. In the Senate but seven votes were cast\r\nagainst the bill. Five of the seven came from the San Francisco\r\ndelegation - Finn, Hare, Hartman, Reily and Wolfe. The two remaining\r\ncame from Alameda and Shasta-Siskiyou Counties. Leavitt, representing\r\nAlameda, and Weed, representing Shasta and Siskiyou, voted with the five\r\nSan Francisco Senators against suppressing bookmaking and pool-selling.\r\n\r\nThe record of the San Francisco Assembly delegation on the anti-gambling\r\nmeasure is scarcely less suggestive. Before the Walker-Otis bill could\r\npass the Assembly the proponents of the measure had to win six fights,\r\nas is shown by the table giving the several votes taken in the Assembly\r\non the Walker-Otis bill. The three most important of the six were:\r\n\r\n1. To prevent the bill being referred back to the Committee on Public\r\nMorals.\r\n\r\n2. To pass the measure on third reading without amendment.\r\n\r\n3. To prevent reconsideration of the vote by which the bill had been\r\npassed.\r\n\r\nIn the first fight twenty-three Assemblymen voted to refer the bill back\r\nto the Committee. Of these twelve - more than one-half - were from San\r\nFrancisco.\r\n\r\nThe day of the second fight, only ten Assemblymen voted on the side of\r\nthe gamblers. Every one of the ten was from San Francisco.\r\n\r\nIn the third fight, on the motion to reconsider, nineteen Assemblymen\r\nvoted for reconsideration. Of these, ten, more than fifty per cent, were\r\nfrom San Francisco.\r\n\r\nOr, to put it in a lump, in the three most important fights over the\r\nWalker-Otis bill in the Assembly, in the aggregate fifty-two votes were\r\ncast against the measure. Of these, thirty-two were from San Francisco\r\nAssemblymen. Only twenty were from outside San Francisco.\r\n\r\nThe universal demand throughout the State for the passage of an\r\nanti-pool selling measure offset the influence and the vote of the San\r\nFrancisco delegation in both Senate and Assembly. But in the issues more\r\ninvolved, where the lines were more closely drawn, San Francisco\r\npractically made the laws for the whole State. This could be\r\ndemonstrated by many instances. The most striking perhaps are shown by\r\nthe histories of the Direct Primary measure and the Railroad Regulation\r\nbills.\r\n\r\nWhen the first fight over the Direct Primary bill came up in the Senate,\r\nit will be remembered, the anti-machine forces defeated the machine by a\r\nvote of twenty-seven to thirteen. Of the thirteen Senators who voted to\r\namend the bill to the liking of Wolfe and Leavitt, six - almost fifty\r\nper cent - were from San Francisco. They were Finn, Hare, Hartman,\r\nKennedy, Reily, Wolfe.\r\n\r\nWhen the machine element had succeeded in amending the Direct Primary\r\nmeasure to its liking in the Assembly and there came a new alignment on\r\nthe bill in the Senate, eight of the nine San Francisco Senators voted\r\nwith Wolfe and Leavitt for the amendments, which denied the people of\r\nCalifornia State-wide vote on candidates for the United States Senate.\r\nOne San Francisco Senator only, Anthony, voted with the better element\r\nin the Senate, against the amendments.\r\n\r\nHad only two of the nine Senators from San Francisco voted for the bill\r\nin its original form, the measure would have been passed by a vote of\r\ntwenty-one to nineteen without the machine amendments.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the San Francisco members in shaping the Direct Primary\r\nlaw was even more forcibly illustrated in the Assembly. Of the eighteen\r\nSan Francisco Assemblymen, fifteen voted for the Assembly amendments,\r\ntwo, Callan and Gerdes, voted against them, and Hopkins is not recorded\r\nas voting.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that the amendments were read into the bill by a\r\nvote of thirty-six to thirty-eight. Had the San Francisco delegation\r\ndivided even on this vote, had nine voted for the amendments and nine\r\nagainst, the vote would have been forty-three against putting them in\r\nthe bill, and thirty-two for, the bill would not have been amended in\r\nthe Assembly; it would have become a law in the same shape that it had\r\noriginally passed the Senate. It is noticeable that in an Assembly of\r\neighty members, only twenty-three of the Assemblymen who voted for the\r\nAssembly amendments to the Direct Primary bill were from outside San\r\nFrancisco. In the Senate eight of the twenty Senators who voted for the\r\namendments were from San Francisco, only twelve were from outside that\r\ncity. Thus, out of 120 members in the Legislature, ninety-three of whom\r\nwere from outside San Francisco, only thirty-five from districts outside\r\nthe metropolis voted for the Assembly, or machine amendments to the\r\nDirect Primary bill. But twenty-three of the twenty-seven San Francisco\r\nSenators and Assemblymen did vote for them, and only three of the San\r\nFrancisco members voted against them.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the people of California who live outside San\r\nFrancisco are decidedly interested in the character of Senators and\r\nAssemblymen whom that city sends to the Legislature.\r\n\r\nThe people of San Francisco are, of course, as much concerned over\r\nreasonable regulation of the transportation companies as Californians\r\nliving outside that city. But the San Francisco Senators were a unit in\r\ntheir opposition to the passage of an effective railroad regulation\r\nmeasure.\r\n\r\nThe fight over the railroad regulation came in the Senate. The final\r\nline-up showed eighteen Senators for the effective Stetson bill and\r\nagainst the ineffective Wright bill; while twenty-two Senators were\r\nagainst the Stetson bill and for the Wright bill. The Wright bill was\r\naccordingly passed. Every one of the nine San Francisco Senators voted\r\nfor the Wright bill. Only thirteen Senators who voted for the Wright\r\nbill were from outside San Francisco.\r\n\r\nIn a word, the proponents of the Stetson bill were from the start\r\nhandicapped by a solid delegation of nine from San Francisco which they\r\ncould not overcome. Had three of the nine San Francisco Senators been\r\nfor the Stetson bill, that measure would now be the law of California.\r\n\r\nThe transportation issue was fought out in the Assembly over the Sanford\r\nSenate resolution endorsing Bristow's plan to establish a line of\r\nGovernment steamers between San Francisco and Panama. The fruit growers\r\nof Southern California are particularly interested in this project. The\r\nAssembly, however, amended all reference to the Bristow report and all\r\ncriticism of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company and the railroads out of\r\nthe resolution.\r\n\r\nOf the eighteen San Francisco Assemblymen only one, Callan, voted\r\nagainst the amendments; fourteen - Beatty, Beban, Coghlan, Collum,\r\nCullen, Hopkins, Lightner, Macauley, McManus, Nelson, O'Neil, Pugh,\r\nPerine and Wheelan - voted for the amendments, while three - Black,\r\nGerdes and Schmitt - did not vote at all.\r\n\r\nThe Local Option bill was also killed by San Francisco votes. This\r\nmeasure was strongly backed by the rural districts. The various\r\ncounties, particularly those engaged in farming, dairying and fruit\r\ngrowing, sent representatives to the Legislature instructed to vote for\r\nLocal Option. The issue in all ways concerned the country districts\r\nrather than the large cities. But the votes of the San Francisco\r\nSenators defeated the Local Option bill.\r\n\r\nThe first fight over the Local Option bill came when in the ordinary\r\ncourse of events it reached third reading. Instead of letting a vote be\r\ntaken on the measure, Wolfe moved that it be referred to the Judiciary\r\nCommittee. This was clearly a move against the passage of the bill, for\r\nit meant delay which might prove fatal. But Wolfe's motion prevailed by\r\na vote of twenty to fifteen. The nine San Francisco Senators voted to\r\nrefer the bill to the committee, only eleven Senators from outside San\r\nFrancisco voted with them.\r\n\r\nThe nine members from San Francisco continued consistent in their\r\nopposition to the measure. When the Local Option bill did come to a vote\r\ntheir nine votes were cast against it.\r\n\r\nThe people of Del Norte county and the people of San Diego county are\r\ndenied the privilege of voting \"Wet or dry\" because of the opposition to\r\nthe Local Option bill of the solid San Francisco delegation in the\r\nSenate. It will be seen that the people of these distant counties are\r\ndecidedly interested in political conditions in San Francisco, for in a\r\nlarge way the character of the San Francisco delegation in the\r\nLegislature is unmistakably reflected in the laws which are passed for\r\nthe government of the entire State.\r\n\r\nTaken as a whole, the San Francisco delegation in Senate and Assembly\r\nwere nothing for that city to be proud of, and at a critical moment San\r\nFrancisco came near paying dearly for her Hartmans, Hares, Macauleys and\r\nMcManuses. But for the intervention of the country members the Islais\r\nCreek bond project would have been defeated.\r\n\r\nThe improvement calls for the purchase of sixty-three water blocks at\r\nIslais Creek to be converted into an inland harbor. The future\r\ndevelopment of San Francisco depends largely upon this improvement. But\r\nprivate interests demanded that nineteen of the sixty-three blocks be\r\nexcluded from the plan, which would have rendered the whole project\r\nimpracticable. When the fight came on, San Francisco Senators and\r\nAssemblymen opposed the purchase of the sixty-three blocks.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, Senator Wolfe, as member of the State Harbors Committee,\r\nhad signed a report which recommended that forty-four blocks only be\r\npurchased. But Wolfe afterwards insisted that he had signed the report\r\nnot knowing what he was doing.\r\n\r\nWhen the fight for the improvement came up in the Senate, only two\r\nSenators, Hartman and Reily, both of San Francisco, opposed the project.\r\nThey were in the end ignominiously defeated, every Senator present\r\nvoting against them. But both Hartman and Reily did the best they knew\r\nhow to defeat the purchase of the area necessary for the improvement.\r\n\r\nThe San Francisco delegation in its opposition to the Islais Creek\r\nproject had better success in the Assembly. Nine San Francisco\r\nAssemblymen, Beban, Black, Cullen, Lightner, Macauley, McManus, O'Neil,\r\nPerine and Wheelan, united against the measure as it had passed the\r\nSenate. They succeeded in throwing doubt upon the necessity of the\r\npurchase of sixty-three blocks, and finally won twenty-two outside\r\nmembers over to their way of thinking. Had it not been for the efforts\r\nof Assemblymen Callan, Beatty and Nelson of San Francisco, backed by the\r\nLos Angeles delegation, the Islais Creek Harbor project would\r\nunquestionably have been defeated in the Assembly, solely because of the\r\nopposition of nine San Francisco Assemblymen.\r\n\r\nBut there is plenty of evidence of improved political conditions at San\r\nFrancisco. An anti-machine Board of Supervisors is standing out manfully\r\nagainst the demands of machine-protected interests. The District\r\nAttorney's office is, indeed, pressing representatives of those\r\ninterests pretty close to the doors of the penitentiary, although the\r\nDistrict Attorney is handicapped by laws for which San Francisco is\r\nlargely responsible, because of the character of the men whom session\r\nafter session she has sent to the Legislature.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, enough to warrant the belief that San Francisco will\r\nimprove the character of the Assembly and Senate delegation. Upon such\r\nimprovement, the well-being of the whole State largely depends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXIV.\r\n\r\nAttacks On And Defense of the Fish Commission\r\n\r\nFast Becoming a Powerful Political Factor - Enormous Fund Which It\r\nExpends Practically Without Check. - Legislative Investigation Blocked -\r\nScheme to Give Commissioners Salary Fails.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWithout the general public realizing just what is going on, the machine\r\nis, in the State Fish and Game Commission, building up an adjunct which\r\nseems destined to play an important part in any fight that may be\r\ncarried on by the independent electors to break the machine's\r\nstrangle-hold upon the State. Naturally the machine element in the\r\nLegislature was prepared always to rally to the defense of the\r\nCommission, and the defense was necessary, for the Commission is\r\nvulnerable, and was attacked at many points.\r\n\r\nThe Commission is perhaps the most extraordinary institution in the\r\nState. At its head is General George Stone, one-time chairman of the\r\nRepublican State Central Committee. At its tail is Jake Steppacher,\r\nanother one-time potent politician who has passed the days of his\r\nusefulness. Between Stone at the lead and Steppacher at the tail, is an\r\nastonishing array of formerly prominent politicians, as well as\r\npoliticians who are decidedly in the present. In fact, the Fish and Game\r\nCommission is fast becoming one of the most potent adjuncts to the State\r\npolitical machine, that strictly non-partisan organization which guards\r\nthe interests of the tenderloin, the Southern Pacific Railroad Company,\r\nthe racetrack gamblers, their associates and allies, and which rather\r\npresumptuously assumes to be the Republican Party of California.\r\n\r\nOne of the features of the session of 1909 was the keen little fight of\r\nthe anti-machine members of the Legislature to restore the Fish and Game\r\nCommission to its one-time simplicity, legitimacy and usefulness, and\r\nthe efforts of the machine members to prevent this.\r\n\r\nUp to two years ago, under the name of Fish Commission, the now Fish and\r\nGame Commission did most admirable work on an allowance of about\r\n$50,000. So far as the writer can ascertain, the Commission's income up\r\nto 1907 never exceeded $54,000 in any one year; usually it was a trifle\r\nunder $50,000.\r\n\r\nBut in 1907 a tax of $1 a year was imposed upon all citizens of\r\nCalifornia who wished to go hunting. Citizens of other States, wishing\r\nto hunt in California, are under the same law taxed $10 a year, while\r\nforeigners are taxed $25. The law provides that the income thus raised\r\nbe turned over to the Fish Commission.\r\n\r\nThe first year that the law was in force, the Commission received\r\n$116,579 on account of it. This, with moneys received from State\r\nappropriations, fines collected and the like, swelled the Commission's\r\nincome for that year, the fiscal year ending June 30, 1908, to\r\n$184,467.70, an increase of more that $130,000 from the previous fiscal\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nFor the fiscal year ending June 30, 1908, the cost of conducting the\r\nGovernor's office, including the Governor's salary, the salaries of his\r\nsecretaries and clerks, stationery, postage stamps, secret service,\r\neverything in a word in connection with the office, was $32,377.\r\n\r\nIn the same way the expense of conducting the State Controller's office\r\nwas $23,417; of the State Treasurer's office, $16,751 ; of the Attorney\r\nGeneral's office, $33,082; of the Surveyor General's office, $20,679; of\r\nthe State Superintendent of Schools' office, $22,380.\r\n\r\nBut the General Stone captained - or perhaps generaled - Fish Commission\r\nhad for that year a modest bit of $184,467. The Fish Commission then,\r\nfor the fiscal year ending June 30, 1908, cost California almost six\r\ntimes as much as did the Governor's office, eight times as much as did\r\nthe Controller's office, eleven times as much as did the State\r\nTreasurer's office, almost six times as much as did the Attorney\r\nGeneral's office, more than nine times as much as the Surveyor General's\r\noffice, and eight times as much as did the State Department of Public\r\nInstruction. And let it be borne in mind that this does not include the\r\nsums which the various counties paid for game wardens and for local\r\nprotection of game, the best protection, by the way, and the most\r\npractical.\r\n\r\nThe $184,467, did not go to the counties. It went exclusively to General\r\nStone's Commission. It will be seen that General Stone's Commission has\r\na very good thing of it.\r\n\r\nAnother surprising feature of the Stone-Generaled Commission is that\r\nthere is little check upon its expenditures. If the Governor wishes to\r\nraise the salary of his secretary or one of his stenographers he must\r\nappeal to the Legislature for permission. The State Controller, the\r\nState Treasurer, the Secretary of State, the State superintendent of\r\nSchools, and so on down the list Of State officials, are powerless to\r\nincrease the salary of an assistant or of a clerk, or of an office boy,\r\nwithout legislative sanction.\r\n\r\nBut not so General Stone's Commission. The Commission is left to do\r\npretty much as it pleases with its income. So, recently, without saying\r\na word to anybody, it increased the salary of one of its deputies\r\n(Vogelsang) from $200 to $300 a month. Three hundred dollars a month is\r\n$3600 a year. Up to this year the salary of the State Controller, of the\r\nSecretary of State, of the State Treasurer, of the Surveyor General, of\r\nthe Superintendent of Public Instruction, etc., was only $3,000 a year.\r\nSo it will be seen that one of General Stone's Deputies was drawing $600\r\na year more salary from the State than the elected State officials.\r\n\r\nJake Steppacher and other politicians, finding easy berths in the\r\nCommission, were also granted generous salary increases.\r\n\r\nBut in ways other than generous increase in the salaries of its deputies\r\nhas the Fish Commission shown its kingly independence. The law provides\r\nthat each State official and Commission shall, biennially, in the\r\nSeptember before the Legislature convenes, file with the Governor a\r\nreport of its activities and expenditures. This enables the Governor to\r\nmake such recommendations as he may deem necessary in his message to the\r\nLegislature. The Controller, Attorney General, in fact all the State\r\nofficials and departments, observed the law last September with but one\r\nexception. The Fish Commission, costing the State from six to eleven\r\ntimes more money that the State departments, did not file a report with\r\nthe Governor.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the Commission had filed no report in September, the\r\ngenerous increase in salaries of its deputies, alleged instances of\r\narbitrary conduct of its representatives, resulted in a resolution being\r\nintroduced by Assemblyman Harry Polsley, demanding that the Commission\r\nbe made the subject of legislative inquiry.\r\n\r\nThe resolution was referred to the Assembly Committee on Fish and Game,\r\na committee notoriously in sympathy with the Commission. The Committee\r\nheld a sort of preliminary hearing which resulted in a general\r\nwhitewashing[100]. Polsley made out what was generally regarded as a\r\nprima facie case against the Commission, but the Committee did not\r\nchoose to consider it such, and so the investigation got no\r\nfurther[100a].\r\n\r\nBut it was noticeable after the \"preliminary hearing\" that the advocates\r\nof the Fish Commission measures did not show up so sprightly confident\r\nof their passage as before. Polsley's efforts were by no means lost.\r\nMany measures intended to strengthen the already gigantically strong\r\nCommission failed of passage, or had their viciousness amended out of\r\nthem, which, had it not been for Polsley's efforts, might have become\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\nThe most important of these was Senate Bill 741. The measure as\r\noriginally introduced by Senator Willis provided that \"every person in\r\nthe State of California, who hunts, pursues or kills any of the wild\r\nbirds or animals, excepting predatory birds or animals, or fishes for\r\nor catches with hook and line any of the protected fish of this State,\r\nwithout first procuring a license therefor, as provided in this Act,\r\nis guilty of a misdemeanor.\"\r\n\r\nHad the act become a law as introduced, not only those who hunt, but\r\nthose who fish, would have been obliged to pay one dollar for a license.\r\nThus, if a family of father, mother and three children wanted to go\r\nfishing, they would first have had to pay five dollars for the\r\nprivilege.\r\n\r\nThe writer has it from a gentleman who has made careful study of the\r\nFish Commission and its ways that the licensing of amateur fishers would\r\nhave increased the income of the Fish and Game Commission $150,000 a\r\nyear. This, with the income already enjoyed by the Commission of\r\n$184,000 a year, would have swelled its annual income to more than\r\n$330,000. This sum is $90,000 more than it cost to maintain the Stockton\r\nHospital for the Insane for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1908;\r\n$125,000 more than the maintenance of the Agnews Asylum for that year;\r\n$122,000 more than the cost of the maintenance of the Folsom State\r\nPrison. The Fish and Game Commission was scarcely modest in its\r\ndemands[101].\r\n\r\nNaturally, the backers of the Fish and Game Commission made a hard fight\r\nfor the measure's passage. But in spite of their efforts they could not\r\nedge it through the Senate until March 3d. In the Assembly, the measure\r\nmet genuine opposition.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly Committee on Fish and Game of course recommended it for\r\npassage, and on March 15th, after a hot fight, it actually passed the\r\nAssembly. But Cattell gave notice of reconsideration. Incidentally,\r\nGovernor Gillett let it be known that he would veto any measure that\r\nrequired amateur fishermen to pay license. This was a damper upon the\r\nFish Commission crowd. When Cattell called the bill up for\r\nreconsideration it was reconsidered and defeated. However, Leeds\r\naccepted an amendment which struck out the clause which provided that\r\namateur fishermen must pay a license tax. On Leeds' motion the next day,\r\nthe amended bill was reconsidered and passed.\r\n\r\nThe three Fish and Game Commissioners serve without salary. Their\r\ncompensation comes from the pleasure of disbursing upwards of $200,000 a\r\nyear, what political prestige there may be in it, and rather generous\r\nexpense money[102]. But a bill was introduced to give each Commissioner\r\na salary of $3,000 a year. The measure did not become law, for which the\r\nwriter believes much credit is due Assemblymen Polsley of Red Bluff. The\r\nState was thus saved $9,000 a year. General Stone and his associates are\r\njust that amount out of pocket. They have, however, given no indication\r\nof resigning their offices because the salary has been denied them.\r\n\r\nBut if the Fish and Game Commission was unsuccessful in increasing its\r\nrevenue and putting through other measures from the standpoint of its\r\nmembers advantageous, its opponents were quite as unsuccessful in their\r\nattacks upon the Commission. Like the panther cat that guards her young,\r\nthe agents of the Commission fought to retain the advantages which they\r\nhad secured in 1907, and were generally successful.\r\n\r\nThe chief of the attacks was that of Assemblyman Polsley, author of\r\nAssembly Bill 433. This bill wasn't very long, contained less than five\r\nlines, in fact, and just forty-three words, but its passage would have\r\nsaved the people of California more than $100,000 a year, or almost as\r\nmuch as it costs the State to run the Governor's office, the\r\nController's office, the State Treasurer's office and the office of\r\nState Superintendent of Schools combined. Assembly Bill 433 repealed the\r\nlaw of 1907, under which hunters are required to pay the Fish and Game\r\nCommission for the privilege of going hunting. The bill was introduced\r\nJanuary 15th. It was referred to the notorious Assembly Committee on\r\nFish and Game. There it was held until March 10th. It was then referred\r\nback to the Assembly with the recommendation that it \"do not pass.\" That\r\nsettled Assembly Bill 433.\r\n\r\nAnother measure which caused the agents of the Fish Commission much\r\nworry was introduced in the Assembly by Preston and in the Senate by\r\nSanford. This bill provided that $50,000 should be paid out of the Fish\r\nand Game Commission fund each year to be used in paying bounties for\r\nexterminating coyotes. This would have left the Commission only about\r\n$130,000 a year. Naturally, the agents of the Commission resented the\r\nraid on their funds. The measure was referred to the Assembly Committee\r\non Fish and Game. This was on January 18th. And it never was heard of\r\nafter.\r\n\r\nThe companion Senate measure, introduced by Sanford, got further, but\r\nnot much. The Senate Committee reported it \"without recommendation.\" But\r\neven so, it passed second reading and went to engrossment and third\r\nreading. There it languished. On March 18th it was withdrawn by its\r\nauthor.\r\n\r\nAnother measure which gave the Commissioners a deal of worry was one\r\nintroduced by Johnson of Placer, which provided that to each hunter who\r\ntook fifty blue jay heads to the County's Clerk's office should be\r\nissued a hunter's license free. It was thought that this would encourage\r\nboys to kill blue jays for the hunter's license prize, value one dollar.\r\nBut General Stone could not see it that way.\r\n\r\n  \"If this bill becomes a law,\" said General Stone, \"we shall have to\r\nretrench somewhere.\"\r\n\r\nThe bill didn't become a law, and the Fish and Game Commission was\r\nsaved.\r\n\r\nBut the most \"unkindest cut of all\" came when the Assembly attempted to\r\nbreak into that sacred Fish and Game Commission fund by way of\r\nresolution. The Assembly actually adopted a resolution calling for a\r\nCommission to be appointed by the Governor for the purpose of\r\nascertaining the feasibility of dividing the State into game districts,\r\nand generously providing $5,000 out of the Fish Commission fund for that\r\npurpose. Naturally the agents of the Fish Commission were scandalized at\r\nthis proposed reckless expenditure of moneys from their fund by somebody\r\nelse. But they were powerless. The resolution went through.\r\n\r\nRather late in the session the Assembly discovered that under the law it\r\ncannot \"resolute\" money out of any fund other than the Assembly\r\ncontingent fund. The resolution was not, therefore, worth the paper it\r\nwas printed on. Once again the sacred Fish Commission fund was saved.\r\n\r\nBut the Assembly could switch money out of the fund by legislative\r\nenactment, and a bill covering the same ground as the resolution was\r\nintroduced without delay.\r\n\r\nThe measure passed the Assembly but did not reach the Senate until March\r\n22d, two days before adjournment. That was very late for such a measure,\r\nbut a heroic effort was made to secure its passage.\r\n\r\nOn Estudillo's motion, an attempt was made to suspend the State\r\nConstitution, declare the bill a matter of special urgency, and pass it\r\nforthwith. But the motion failed. Again did the Fish Commission escape a\r\nraid on its fund.\r\n\r\nSenator Walker and Assemblyman Rutherford introduced measures providing\r\nfor a distribution of the fund with counties, which at any rate looked\r\npretty good to the counties, although the agents of the Fish Commission\r\nwere not pleased at all.\r\n\r\nThe bills provided that one-half of the moneys collected from the sale\r\nof hunters' licenses, and on account of fines for infringement of the\r\nState game laws, should be paid to the counties in which collected, and\r\nthe balance go to the Fish Commission fund.\r\n\r\nWalker's bill was introduced on January 8th. It went to the Senate\r\nCommittee on Fish and Game and was never heard of after.\r\n\r\nRutherford's bill was introduced on January 15th. It went to the\r\nAssembly Committee on Fish and Game. Like the Walker bill, the\r\nRutherford bill was lost in committee oblivion.\r\n\r\nSuch, from the standpoint of the more important bills to increase and to\r\ndecrease the Fish Commission fund, was the record of fish and game\r\nlegislation. The Fish and Game Commission - and its overgrown fund - is\r\nstill with us. But it might have been infinitely worse. Bad little boys\r\nwho play hookey from Sunday-school to go fishing, for example, might\r\nhave - in addition to the other frightful penalties imposed on them -\r\nbeen compelled to pay a license tax of $1 for the privilege.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[100] That the Fish and Game Committee would whitewash the Commission\r\nwas recognized from the first. Even members of the machine who stand for\r\ngenuine game protection objected to this committee making the\r\ninvestigation. When the motion was made to refer the resolution to this\r\ncommittee, Assemblyman Greer of Sacramento, took the floor to protest:\r\n\r\n\"It is useless to refer the matter to the Committee on Fish and Game,\"\r\nsaid Greer, \"for we all know what that committee will do. We'll get no\r\naction there. Let it go to some committee that will give it\r\nconsideration.\"\r\n\r\n[100a] The Fish and Game Commission was very bitter against Polsley and\r\nall who approved his course. Because of the incident, Game Warden Welch\r\nof Santa Cruz County lost his position. Welch was a county official,\r\npaid by the county. The Commission complained that he had written a\r\nletter to Polsley commending the Assemblyman for his effort to secure a\r\nreport 'from the Commission. Santa Cruz County receives a monthly\r\nstipend from the Commission toward the support of the Brookdale\r\nhatchery. The writer is reliably informed that one of the Commissioners\r\nstated that the Commission would do nothing for Santa Cruz County so\r\nlong as \"that man Welch\" remained in office. Welch was removed by the\r\nSupervisors. Welch has a national-wide reputation as a game warden, and\r\nsuch papers as the \"Forest and Stream,\" New York, and \"Sports Afield,\"\r\nChicago, have joined the California press in denunciation of his\r\ndismissal.\r\n\r\nAs these pages are going through the press, word comes from Santa Cruz\r\nthat Welch has been reinstated by Judge Lucas F. Smith of the Superior\r\nCourt of Santa Cruz County.\r\n\r\nIn summarizing his findings, Judge Smith holds that the local Board of\r\nSupervisors exceeded its legal power in declaring vacant the office of\r\nvoluntary warden, which Welch held; exceeded its legal authority in\r\nremoving Welch without specific charges being prepared, notice served on\r\nhim and an opportunity given for a hearing.\r\n\r\n[101] All sorts of estimates have been made of the income that would\r\nhave been enjoyed by the Fish and Game Commission, had this bill become\r\na law. The lowest that the writer knows of, made by a disinterested\r\nperson, places the increase at $50,000 a year.\r\n\r\n[102] Some of the commission's expense accounts on file with the State\r\nController are curiosities. For example, General Stone when he is on\r\ncommission business taxes the fund $1 for breakfast, $1 for lunch, $1\r\nfor dinner. It thus costs the Commission three annual hunter's licenses\r\nto feed General Stone for a day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXV.\r\n\r\nThe Rewarding of the Faithful.\r\n\r\nSenators and Assemblymen Whose Votes Were Cast Against Reform Measures\r\nGiven State and Federal Positions in Some Instances, in Others Appointed\r\nto Holdover Committees or Sent on Trips at the Expense of the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe machine has many ways of rewarding the faithful who persist until\r\nthe end. The faithful member of Senate or Assembly may be rewarded by a\r\nFederal appointment (Senator Bates has just been graciously recognized\r\nin this way[102a]) or he may be given a State job (witness Senator Price\r\nor Assemblyman Beardslee) ; or he may be put on a legislative hold-over\r\ncommittee to investigate something, or to represent the State at\r\nsomething, or to prepare some kind of a bill to be introduced at the\r\nnext session of the Legislature.\r\n\r\nThis last is perhaps the most genteel method of reward. It entails\r\nlittle work, gives the beneficiary a certain distinction and pays very\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nNine Senators were rewarded in this way in the closing hours of the\r\nsession of 1909. There might have been ten, but that prince of\r\n\"bandwagon\" Senators, Welch, had to be rewarded twice, so but nine got\r\nholdover committeeships. They are Wolfe, Welch, Wright, Willis, Leavitt,\r\nBills (labeled Republicans), Kennedy, Hare and Curtin (labeled\r\nDemocrats). The names of the nine are not unfamiliar. With the exception\r\nof that of Curtin, their votes during the session were consistently cast\r\non the side of the machine. For them to be rewarded came as a matter of\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nThe machine will continue to reward such men until the people take the\r\nLegislature out of machine hands. But that is another story.\r\n\r\nThe Legislative Holdover Committee is about as useless a thing as can be\r\nimagined. This is very well illustrated by the State's experience with\r\nthe so-called Harbors Committee, appointed by the Legislature of 1907 to\r\ninquire into harbor conditions throughout the State.\r\n\r\nThe committee consisted of three Senators and three Assemblymen. The\r\nSenators managed to incur expenses of $2,524.20. Assemblymen were more\r\nmodest. Their expenses were only $1,851.80, making a total expense\r\ncharge for the committee of $4,376.\r\n\r\nBut the $4,376 covers the committee's expenses only, does not provide\r\ncompensation for the committeemen. A bill appropriating $6,000 for that\r\npurpose was introduced at the session of 1909. This gave the\r\ncommitteemen $1,000 each for their services. It made the investigation\r\ncost the State $10,376[102b].\r\n\r\nThe Harbors Committee - or somebody or something else, the writer is not\r\nsure which - prepared an elaborate report of the committee's findings.\r\nBut owing to a surprising blunder that involved Senator Wolfe most\r\ncuriously, the report was not filed until March 23, the day before the\r\nLegislature adjourned. The report was ordered printed in the journal,\r\nbut it did not appear in the journal of the 23rd, which was circulated\r\non the morning of the 24th. Instead, was a note to the effect that it\r\nwould appear in the corrected journal. So, few knew that it had been\r\nfiled at all, and it went unnoticed by the daily press.\r\n\r\nBut the details of the report[102c] were known to the general public\r\nlong before it was filed with the Senate, and its provisions made\r\nSenator Wolfe appear to exceptional disadvantage. Wolfe was a member of\r\nthe Harbors Committee, as was Senator Wright. Among the recommendations\r\nset forth in the report as originally prepared, was one that forty-four\r\nblocks only of land be purchased by the State for the improvement of the\r\nSan Francisco Harbor at Islais Creek, instead of the sixty-three blocks\r\nnecessary for practical harbor development.\r\n\r\nSenator Wolfe was a warm advocate of the sixty-three block plan which is\r\nthe only practical plan, by the way, and shows that Senator Wolfe can\r\nland on the right side of things occasionally. But it was very\r\ndiscouraging for Senator Wolfe to be confronted with the unfiled report\r\nof his own Harbors Committee, endorsed by his own signature as\r\ncommitteeman, in which the purchase of only forty-four blocks was urged.\r\n\r\nSenator Wolfe's defense was ingenious. He stated that he had signed the\r\nreport as a matter of courtesy, not really knowing what it contained.\r\nThe incident illustrates the value to the State of such legislative\r\ninvestigations.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of the curious history of Wolfe's Harbors Committee, he was\r\ngiven another holdover committee in 1909. The Senate - on Wolfe's motion\r\n- adopted a resolution setting aside $5,000 to meet the expenses of a\r\nholdover committee to consist of three members to investigate the cause\r\nof recent advances in the cost of foodstuffs. Senators Wolfe, Welch and\r\nHare are honored with the appointments. Lieutenant-Governor Porter\r\nappointed.\r\n\r\nSenator Wolfe, from the machine standpoint, certainly earned the\r\ndistinction thus thrust upon him, and his share of the money. Senator\r\nWolfe was not in good health during the session, but in spite of his\r\nindisposition he managed to be present in the Senate Chamber, where\r\noften, pale, haggard and plainly on the verge of breakdown, he fought\r\nvaliantly against the reform measures which were aimed at the prestige\r\nof the State machine, and the domination of the tenderloin, the Southern\r\nPacific Railroad, the racetrack gamblers and allied interests in State\r\npolitics.\r\n\r\nWolfe led the fight against the Walker-Otis Anti-Gambling bill, against\r\nthe Local Option bill, against the effective Stetson Railroad Regulation\r\nbill, against the Direct Primary bill, against admitting Senator Bell of\r\nPasadena to the Republican caucus, against the bill to prohibit the sale\r\nof intoxicants within a mile and a half of Stanford University, against\r\nthe initiative amendment to the Constitution, against the amendment to\r\nthe Constitution to correct ambiguities as to the powers and duties of\r\nthe State Railroad Commission, and against Burnett's resolution for the\r\ninvestigation of the cause of the increase in freight rates and express\r\ncharges. Senator Wolfe also led the fight for the passage of the Change\r\nof Venue bill.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, Senator Wolfe's stock argument, used in most of the\r\nopposition to reform measures, was to the effect that if such measures\r\nbecame laws, the Republican party in California would be undermined.\r\nSenator Wolfe's argument had great weight with Republicans like Leavitt\r\nand Weed and Democrats like Hare and Kennedy. For the \"good of the\r\nRepublican party,\" these gentlemen generally voted as Senator Wolfe\r\ndictated.\r\n\r\nSenator Welch, the second member of the Pure Food Committee, is at least\r\nentitled to gracious consideration at the hands of the Wolfe-Leavitt\r\nelement. Senator Welch was one of the twenty-seven Call-heralded heroes\r\nwho defeated the Wolfe-Leavitt element in the first fight on the Direct\r\nPrimary bill in the Senate. And Senator Welch was one of the seven\r\nheroes who \"flopped\" to the Wolfe-Leavitt side when the psychological\r\nmoment came. Welch's one vote in the final struggle would have decided\r\nthe Direct Primary fight for the side of the reform element. But when\r\nthe reform element needed Welch he was found snugly quartered with Wolfe\r\nand Leavitt.\r\n\r\nWelch voted for the Walker-Otis bill, but he was one of the last members\r\nof the Senate to be counted for that measure. Indeed, Welch caught the\r\nrear of the bandwagon on that issue just in time.\r\n\r\nOn railroad issues Welch's record is as good as the Southern Pacific\r\nRailroad could wish. He voted against the adoption of the practical\r\nabsolute rate, and for the impracticable maximum rate; he voted for the\r\nineffective Wright bill and against the effective Stetson bill. He voted\r\nagainst the Constitutional Amendment simplyfying the wording of the\r\nConstitution in those sections which prescribe the powers and duties of\r\nthe Railroad Commissioners.\r\n\r\nSo Senator Welch had his appointment to the Food Investigation Committee\r\ndue him. He was also made member of the Legislative Committee to\r\nrepresent the State at the Alaska-Yukon Exposition, of which more later.\r\nThus Senator Welch rounded out the session very satisfactorily to\r\nSenator Welch and to the machine, if not to the State of California.\r\n\r\nSenator Hare is down in the legislative records as a Democrat. He voted\r\non most measures consistently under the lead of Wolfe and Leavitt. His\r\nappointment need not, therefore, cause surprise.\r\n\r\nWhen the Direct Primary bill was before the Senate Committee on Election\r\nLaws, Hare's vote was with those of Wolfe and Leavitt to make the\r\nmeasure as ineffective as possible. Hare was among the thirteen\r\nunworthies who voted against the measure when the first fight was made\r\nfor it on the floor of the Senate; he was among the twenty who finally,\r\nunder Wolfe's leadership, held the measure up in the Senate until by\r\ntrick it could be amended to the machine's liking. Hare was one of the\r\nseven Senators who voted against the Walker-Otis Anti-Gambling bill. He\r\nwas one of those who voted for the passage of the Change of Venue bill.\r\n\r\nOn railroad measures Hare voted against the Stetson bill and for the\r\nWright bill, against the absolute rate and for the maximum rate. He\r\nvoted against the amendment to the Constitution to clear up the alleged\r\nambiguity regarding the powers and duties of the Railroad Commissioners.\r\n\r\nLack of space prevents continuance of the review of Hare's votes. But\r\nenough has been said to show that this \"Democrat\" was entitled to the\r\nhonor at the hands of the Performer, Republican Lieutenant Governor\r\nWarren Porter, of appointment to the Holdover Committee which, under the\r\nleadership of Senator Eddie Wolfe, will investigate the cause of the\r\nincrease in the price of foodstuffs.\r\n\r\nBut a far more desirable appointment was to the committee which is to\r\nrepresent the State at the Alaska-Yukon Pacific Exposition. By\r\nconcurrent resolution the Senate and Assembly decided that seven\r\nSenators, seven Assemblymen, one Lieutenant Governor (Warren Porter) and\r\none Governor (Gillett) should attend the exposition at the State's\r\nexpense. For this purpose $7,000 of the State's money has been provided.\r\n\r\nThe seven Senators appointed by Performer Porter are Wright, Willis,\r\nWelch, Leavitt, Bills, Kennedy, Curtin.\r\n\r\nThe seven Assemblymen appointed by Speaker Stanton are Transue,\r\nBeardslee, Leeds, Hewitt, McManus, McClellan and Schimtt.\r\n\r\nThe records of the Senators thus honored show them worthy the machine's\r\nconsideration. Their votes on the banner measures before the Legislature\r\nlast winter were as follows:\r\n\r\nAgainst the Walker-Otis bill, to prohibit poolselling and bookmaking\r\n(Anti-Gambling bill)  - Leavitt - 1.\r\n\r\nFor the Walker-Otis bill-Bills, Curtin, Kennedy, Willis, Welch, Wright -\r\n6.\r\n\r\nOnly seven Senators voted against the Walker-Otis bill. Of the seven\r\nLeavitt is given the Alaska trip; Wolfe and Hare are put on the Food\r\nInvestigation Committee. Thus of nine Senators who got on holdover\r\ncommittees three were among the seven who voted in the interest of the\r\ngambling element.\r\n\r\nThe records made by the State Senators who will attend the exposition at\r\nthe State's expense in the Direct Primary fight are quite as suggestive.\r\nWhen the first attempt was made in the Senate to force the machine\r\namendments into the bill, February 18, the seven Senators voted as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nFor the machine's amendments - Bills, Kennedy, Leavitt, Willis.\r\n\r\nAgainst the machine's amendments - Curtin, Welch, Wright.\r\n\r\nThirteen Senators on February 18 voted for the machine's amendments. Of\r\ntheir number Hare and Wolfe are on the Food Investigation Committee;\r\nBills, Kennedy, Leavitt and Willis are to attend the exposition at the\r\nState's expense. Thus six of the thirteen have been rewarded.\r\n\r\nThe machine, having failed to amend the Direct Primary bill in the\r\nSenate, amended it in the Assembly. When the measure was returned to the\r\nSenate, six of the seven Senators who will attend the exposition voted\r\nto concur in the Assembly amendments. They were, Bills, Kennedy,\r\nLeavitt, Welch, Willis and Wright. Only one of the seven voted against\r\nthe machine amendments, Curtin.\r\n\r\nThe records of the seven favored, trip-taking Senators on railroad\r\nregulation measures are as follows:\r\n\r\nFor the Wright bill, against the Stetson bill; for the maximum rate,\r\nagainst the absolute rate - Leavitt, Welch, Willis, Wright, Bills,\r\nKennedy - 6.\r\n\r\nAgainst the Wright bill, for the Stetson bill, against the maximum rate,\r\nfor the absolute rate - Curtin - 1.\r\n\r\nAgainst the constitutional amendment to make clear the powers and duties\r\nof Railroad Commissioners - Bills, Kennedy, Leavitt, Welch, Willis - 5.\r\n\r\nFor the amendment - Curtin, Wright - 2.\r\n\r\nAgainst the Burnett resolution calling for an investigation of the cause\r\nfor an increase in freight rates - Bills, Kennedy, Leavitt, Willis,\r\nWright - 5.\r\n\r\nFor the resolution - 0.\r\n\r\nAbsent or not voting - Curtin, Welch - 2.\r\n\r\nThe records of the seven on the Local Option bill and the Change of\r\nVenue bill are:\r\n\r\nAgainst Local Option - Leavitt, Welch, Willis, Bills, Curtin, Kennedy -\r\n6.\r\n\r\nFor Local Option - Wright - 1.\r\n\r\nFor the Change of Venue bill - Bills, Leavitt, Welch, Willis, Wright -\r\n5.\r\n\r\nAgainst the Change of Venue bill - Curtin, Kennedy - 2.\r\n\r\nKennedy, to be sure, voted against the Change of Venue bill when that\r\nmeasure passed the Senate. But Senator Kennedy was unaccountably absent\r\nthe next morning when the Change of Venue bill was taken up on a motion\r\nfor reconsideration. Because of Kennedy's absence, the motion to\r\nreconsider the measure was lost, and its defeat prevented. Senator\r\nKennedy is scarcely entitled to credit for being recorded on the right\r\nside of this measure.\r\n\r\nNine Senators are included in the two hold-over committees which are\r\nunder consideration. As Wolfe and Hare invariably voted with Leavitt, it\r\nwill be seen that eight of the nine voted against the Stetson bill and\r\nfor the Wright bill; seven of the nine voted against the Constitutional\r\namendment to make plain the constitutional powers and duties of the\r\nRailroad Commissioners; seven of the nine voted against investigating\r\nthe cause of increase in freight and express rates to the Pacific Coast;\r\neight of the nine voted against local option; seven voted for the Change\r\nof Venue bill, and one of the two others as good as voted for it,\r\nalthough on record against the measure.\r\n\r\nAs Republican Senators Bell, Birdsall, Black, Boynton, Cutten,\r\nRoseberry, Rush, Stetson, Strobridge and Thompson, who were invariably\r\non the right side of things, look upon the records of the \"Democrats\"\r\nand \"Republicans\" included among the nine favored receivers of plums,\r\nthey can scarcely be blamed for demanding with the discouraged little\r\nboy - What's the use of being good, anyhow?\r\n\r\nAnd as the Democratic Senators, Caminetti, Campbell, Cartwright,\r\nHolohan, Miller and Sanford, who worked with the anti-machine\r\nRepublicans for the passage of good laws and the defeat of bad ones look\r\nupon the favored Hare and Kennedy they cannot be blamed if the same\r\nquestion occurs to them also.\r\n\r\nThe indications are that the Senators who were thus overlooked will have\r\n\"to wait for theirs,\" until The People of California, and not the\r\nmachine, award the prizes for faithful public service.\r\n\r\nOf the seven Assemblymen who will attend the Alaska-Yukon Exposition,\r\none, Hewitt, voted against the machine on every important issue that\r\ncame up. The other six are a spotted lot.\r\n\r\nThe six - Beardslee, Leeds, McManus, McClellan, Schmitt and Transue -\r\nvoted for the famous \"gag rules\" which the Assembly rejected by a vote\r\nof 41 to 32. Indeed, Beardslee and Transue were on the Committee on\r\nRules which the Assembly, when it rejected the Committee's rules,\r\nrepudiated.\r\n\r\nIn the fight for the passage of the Walker-Otis Anti-Gambling bill, two\r\nof the six, Leeds and Transue, managed to keep their records straight.\r\nOn the six roll-calls taken on the measure before it passed the\r\nAssembly, Beardslee voted five times against the bill and once for it;\r\nMcManus voted six times against it; Schmitt voted five times against it,\r\non one roll-call he did not vote; while McClellan voted four times for\r\nit and twice against.\r\n\r\nFive of the six, Beardslee, Leeds, McManus, McClellan and Schmitt voted\r\nagainst forcing out of the Committee on Federal Relations the Sanford\r\nresolution, which called for a government line of steamers from Panama\r\nto San Francisco. The five voted for the Johnson amendments to the\r\nresolutions, which cut out all criticizing reference to the\r\nrate-boosting combinations between the great transportation companies.\r\nTransue was absent when the vote to force the resolution out of\r\ncommittee was taken. But he was present to vote for the Johnson\r\namendments.\r\n\r\nFive of the six, Leeds, McManus, McClellan, Schmitt and Transue, voted\r\nfor the machine amendments to the Direct Primary bill, which were read\r\ninto that measure in the Assembly, and which resulted in the Senate\r\ndeadlock over the measure. Beardslee voted against the amendments.\r\n\r\nFive of the six - Beardslee, Leeds, McManus, McClellan and Transue -\r\nvoted against the Holohan bill to remove the party circle from the\r\nelection ballot. Schmitt did not vote on this measure.\r\n\r\nAssemblyman Hewitt will, at the Alaska-Yukon, find himself in\r\ndistinguished company. From the Wolfe-Leavitt-Johnson standpoint, he is\r\nthe only one of his associates who cannot be said to have earned the\r\npreferment thrust upon him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[102a] As these forms are going through the press, word comes that\r\nSenator Willis has been made Assistant United States District Attorney\r\nat Los Angeles. See Willis' record, Table \"A\" of the appendix.\r\n\r\n[102b] The State Constitution provides no method of compensation for\r\nsuch services. The providing of this compensation, therefore, becomes a\r\nmatter of great delicacy. It is done, under a decision of the Supreme\r\nCourt that that tribunal cannot go back of a legislative Act, but must\r\nabide by the wording of the Act. The appropriation bills to compensate\r\nthe members for their services on hold-over Committees are worded to\r\nmeet the opinion of the courts. The money is invariably appropriated \"to\r\npay the claim of,\" etc. The Legislature is, according to the courts, the\r\nsole Judge of whether the alleged claim is a claim and not a petition\r\nfor a gift. The \"to -pay- the-claim-of\" bills never fail to pull down\r\nthe money.\r\n\r\n[102c] The report as originally drawn, and as it was signed by Senator\r\nWolfe and his associates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXVI.\r\n\r\nThe Holdover Senators.\r\n\r\nEleven of Them May Be Counted Upon to Vote Against the Machine at the\r\nSession of 1911, Two Are Doubtful, One Will Probably Vote with the\r\nMajority, While Six May Be Counted Upon to Support Machine Policies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwenty of the 120 members who sat in the Legislature of 1909 - half of\r\nthe forty Senators - hold over and will serve in the Legislature of\r\n1911. The twenty constitute the strength with which the machine and the\r\nanti-machine forces will enter the field in the struggle for control of\r\nthe Legislature two years hence.\r\n\r\nThe machine has, long before this, taken stock of those twenty holdover\r\nSenators. Machine agents unquestionably know what the holdover members\r\nowe and to whom indebted; know their family history; know the church to\r\nwhich they belong, their lodges, their likes, their dislikes and their\r\nprejudices; know how they can be \"reached\" if vulnerable; know how they\r\ncan be \"kept in line\" if already tarred with the machine brush.\r\n\r\nBut the plain citizen, not within the charmed circle of machine\r\nprotection, is not concerning himself much about these holdovers. He\r\nscarcely knows their names. It is safe to say that not 2 per cent of the\r\nvoters of California could off-hand name the twenty holdover members of\r\nthe Upper House of the Legislature.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the machine is posted, and the citizen is not. And here\r\nis the secret of much of the machine's success. In its campaign for\r\ncontrol of affairs, the machine knows to a nicety just what to expect\r\nfrom men in public life; the plain citizen is without such information.\r\n\r\nIn the Appendix will be found a table, \"Table H,\" showing the votes of\r\nthe twenty holdover Senators on sixteen roll calls. Representative\r\ncitizens, all standing for good government, may differ as to the\r\ndesirability or undesirability of several of the measures included in\r\nthe list. But by and large the average normal citizen will hold that\r\ncertain of the sixteen measures are desirable and others undesirable.\r\nThus all would probably agree that the Change of Venue bill is\r\nundesirable legislation, and declare the Walker-Otis Anti-Racetrack\r\nGambling measure to be desirable, although they might honestly differ on\r\nthe Local Option bill.\r\n\r\nOn the sixteen roll calls the twenty holdover Senators cast 283 votes.\r\nOf the 283, 164 are recorded against what the normal citizen would\r\nregard as bad measures, or for what the normal citizen would regard as\r\ngood measures. In other words, speaking broadly, 164 of the 283 votes\r\nwere cast against machine policies. Only 119 were cast with the machine.\r\nIn other words, over the whole session, on what may be fairly considered\r\nthe most important roll calls taken in the Senate, the holdover Senators\r\ncast 164 votes against the machine and only 119 votes for the machine.\r\nThis isn't a bad showing to start with.\r\n\r\nThe showing is strengthened by the fact that ninety-two of the 119\r\nmachine votes were cast by eight Senators, Finn, Wolfe, Bills,\r\nMartinelli, Hurd, Hare, Lewis and Welch. Senator Finn of San Francisco\r\nheads the list with fifteen of these negative votes. On one occasion\r\nSenator Finn didn't vote. After Finn comes Wolfe, also from San\r\nFrancisco, with thirteen of the ninety-two negative or machine votes to\r\nhis credit or his discredit; Bills of Sacramento and Martinelli of Marin\r\nfollow with twelve each; Hurd of Los Angeles with eleven; Hare of San\r\nFrancisco and Lewis of San Joaquin with ten each, and Welch of San\r\nFrancisco with nine.\r\n\r\nThis leaves twenty-seven machine votes to be divided among twelve of the\r\nholdover Senators, about two votes on an average each.\r\n\r\nBurnett is credited with seven of the twenty-seven, which reduces the\r\nnumber to twenty for eleven Senators. Of the twenty votes, seven were\r\ncast in the two ballots taken on the Local Option issue, again the bill;\r\nand eight were cast in two ballots against the Holohan bill to remove\r\nthe party circle from the election ballot.\r\n\r\nThus, excluding the votes on local option, and on the Party Circle bill,\r\non twelve important ballots, eleven of the holdover Senators cast only\r\nfive votes for machine policies.\r\n\r\nThe eleven are Birdsall, Campbell, Cutten, Estudillo, Holohan,\r\nRoseberry, Rush, Stetson, Strobridge, Thompson and Walker.\r\n\r\nThese eleven Senators, as judged by their performances at the session\r\njust closed, may be depended upon to vote for good bills and against bad\r\nones at the session of 1911.\r\n\r\nTo this list should be added the name of Burnett. Burnett got off wrong\r\non the Stetson Railroad Regulation bill, and managed to land with the\r\nWolfe element in the direct primary fight. But there is good reason to\r\nbelieve that Burnett was very sick of his company before the session\r\nclosed. The probabilities are that Senator Burnett feels more at home\r\nwith Senators Stetson, Strobridge, Thompson and Cutten than with Hare,\r\nFinn and Wolfe.\r\n\r\nSenator Hurd is another holdover who started out very well, but went\r\nbadly astray after the vote on the Railroad Regulation bills. Like\r\nBurnett, Hurd showed signs toward the end of the session of feeling\r\nhimself in uncongenial company. There is reason to believe that Hurd at\r\nthe next session will be found voting with the\r\nThompson-Stetson-Strobridge element.\r\n\r\nSenator Welch will be found voting with the majority. This reduces the\r\nnumber of holdover Senators who can be counted upon to accept Wolfe's\r\nleadership, machine Senators, if you like, to six. The line-up of the\r\ntwenty holdovers, then, would on this basis be as follows:\r\n\r\nAnti-machine - Birdsall, Cutten, Estudillo, Roseberry, Rush, Stetson,\r\nStrobridge, Thompson, Walker (Republicans), Campbell, Holohan\r\n(Democrats) - 11.\r\n\r\nDoubtful - Burnett, Hurd (Republicans)  - 2.\r\n\r\nWith the majority - Welch (Republican) - 1.\r\n\r\nMachine - Bills, Finn, Lewis[103], Martinelli, Wolfe (Republicans), Hare\r\n(Democrat) - 6.\r\n\r\nOn this basis the anti-machine element will start with all the advantage\r\nin the struggle for control of the Senate in 1911. If Burnett and Hurd\r\nvote with the eleven anti-machine Senators, it will be necessary to\r\nelect only eight anti-machine Senators that the reform element may\r\ncontrol the Senate. This will mean twenty-two votes for the reform\r\nelement, for Welch, if he is to be judged by past performances, will be\r\nfound with the majority.\r\n\r\n From present indications, four important fights will be made at the\r\nLegislative session of 1911.\r\n\r\n(1) To pass an effective railroad regulation measure and to amend those\r\nsections of the State Constitution which prescribe the duties and powers\r\nof the Railroad Commissioners.\r\n\r\n(2) To amend the Direct Primary law passed at the session just closed to\r\nmeet with the popular demand for an effective measure.\r\n\r\n(3) To grant local option to the counties.\r\n\r\n(4) To adopt an amendment to the State Constitution granting the\r\ninitiative to the electors of the State.\r\n\r\nSignificantly enough, the line-up of the holdover Senators in the Direct\r\nPrimary deadlock of the last session was nine to eleven, the eleven\r\nSenators who divide but five machine votes between them standing out\r\nagainst Wolfe and Leavitt for an effective provision for the selection\r\nof United States Senators by State-wide vote, while the six machine\r\nSenators, the \"bandwagon\" Senator and the two doubtfuls, voted with\r\nWolfe and Leavitt.\r\n\r\nBut the probabilities are that in the event of the anti-machine element\r\ncontrolling the Senate of 1911, Burnett, Hurd, Lewis, Martinelli and\r\nWelch would join with the reform forces to make necessary amendments to\r\nthe measure. When the Direct Primary bill was first before the Senate,\r\nthese five Senators united with the Good Government forces and assisted\r\nin defeating the machine's amendment. When the bill was amended in the\r\nAssembly, however, the five flopped to the machine side. Indeed, only\r\nfour of the twenty holdover Senators voted for the machine's amendments\r\nto the Direct Primary bill when the measure was first passed upon by the\r\nSenate. They were Bills, Finn, Hare and Wolfe.\r\n\r\nThe holdover Senators made their poorest showing on the railroad\r\nmeasures. When the test came on the Stetson bill the twenty holdovers\r\nsplit even, ten being for the effective Stetson bill, ten for the\r\nineffective Wright bill. The line-up was as follows:\r\n\r\nFor the Stetson bill - Birdsall, Campbell, Cutten, Holohan, Lewis,\r\nRoseberry, Rush, Stetson, Strobridge, Thompson - 10.\r\n\r\nFor the Wright bill - Bills, Burnett, Estudillo, Finn, Hare, Hurd,\r\nMartinelli, Walker, Welch, Wolfe - 10.\r\n\r\nLewis, who usually voted with the performers, voted for the Stetson\r\nbill. But the reform forces lost two votes, those of Walker and\r\nEstudillo. On another vote on the same issue, however, Burnett,\r\nEstudillo and Walker would probably be found with the anti-machine\r\nforces supporting an effective measure. This would make the vote of the\r\nholdover Senators, thirteen for effective railroad regulation, and seven\r\nfor a measure of the Wright law variety.\r\n\r\nThe holdovers made a good showing on the Initiative amendment, eleven\r\nvoting for it and five against it, four not voting at all. The vote was\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\nFor the Initiative - Birdsall, Campbell, Cutten, Estudillo, Hare,\r\nRoseberry, Rush, Stetson, Thompson, Walker, Welch - 11.\r\n\r\nAgainst the Initiative - Bills, Hurd, Lewis, Martinelli, Wolfe - 5.\r\n\r\nNot voting - Burnett, Finn, Holohan, Strobridge - 4.\r\n\r\nOf the four who did not vote, three, Burnett, Holohan and Strobridge,\r\nwould have voted for the amendment. Finn would probably have voted\r\nagainst it. This would have made the vote fourteen to six in the\r\namendment's favor. It will be seen that those who would have the\r\ninitiative granted the people, have a good start for the next session.\r\n\r\nThe outlook for local option is not so reassuring. Of the holdover\r\nSenators who ordinarily were for measures which give the people a voice\r\nin the management of public affairs, Birdsall, Holohan, Rush and\r\nStrobridge were unalterably opposed to the local option idea. The six\r\nmachine Senators, of course, opposed it, which with the votes of\r\nBurnett, Welch and Hurd placed thirteen of the twenty holdover Senators\r\nagainst the measure.\r\n\r\nSix of the holdovers voted for the Local Option bill - Campbell, Cutten,\r\nEstudillo, Roseberry, Thompson and Walker.\r\n\r\nStetson was absent and did not vote. He, however, favored the bill. His\r\nvote would have made it 13 to 7. Thus on the vote on their bill at the\r\nlast session, the local option forces have seven of the holdover\r\nSenators with them, and thirteen against.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, seventeen of the holdover Senators voted for the\r\nWalker-Otis Anti-Racetrack Gambling bill, while only three, Finn, Hare\r\nand Wolfe, voted against it. Thus on the moral issue, as well as the\r\npolitical and the industrial, the anti-machine element is stronger in\r\nthe holdover delegation in the Senate than is the machine. It rests with\r\nthe good citizenship of California to maintain its advantage by electing\r\nto the Senate in 1910, men who will stand with the majority of the\r\nholdover members for the passage of good and the defeat of vicious\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[103] Lewis voted with the anti-machine element in the Railroad\r\nRegulation fight, one of the most severe tests of the session. Persons\r\nwho know Lewis well stated that he will, if the anti-machine forces be\r\neffectively organized at the session of 1911, be found against the\r\nmachine. It is \"up to Senator Lewis.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXVII.\r\n\r\nThe Retiring Senators.\r\n\r\nOf the Twenty Whose Terms of Office Will Have Expired, the Machine Loses\r\nEleven, the Anti-Machine Element Seven - Two Who Voted With the Machine\r\non Occasion Were Usually on the Side of Good Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwenty of the forty Senators who sat in the Legislature of 1909, must,\r\nif they sit in the Legislature of 1911, be re-elected at the general\r\nelections in November 1910. They are: Senators Anthony of San Francisco,\r\nBates of Alameda, Bell of Pasadena, Black of Santa Clara, Boynton of\r\nYuba, Caminetti of Amador, Cartwright of Fresno, Curtin of Tuolumne,\r\nHartman of San Francisco, Kennedy of San Francisco, Leavitt of Alameda,\r\nMcCartney of Los Angeles, Miller of Kern, Price of Sonoma, Reily of San\r\nFrancisco, Sanford of Mendocino, Savage of Los Angeles, Weed of\r\nSiskiyou, Willis of San Bernardino and Wright of San Diego.\r\n\r\nBy consulting Table A of the Appendix, it will be seen that on sixteen\r\nroll calls the forty members of the Senate of 1909 voted 570 times. Of\r\nthe 570 votes 311 were cast against what are regarded as machine\r\npolicies; 259 for such policies. Of the 311 anti-machine votes, 164 were\r\ncast by holdover Senators, and were considered in the last chapter,\r\nwhile 147 were cast by Senators whose successors will be elected in\r\n1910. Thus it will be seen, that on this basis, more desirable Senators\r\nwill hold over than those whose terms of office will have expired before\r\nthe next Legislature convenes.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of the machine votes the result is as satisfactory. On the\r\nsixteen roll calls, 259 machine votes were cast. Of these 140 were cast\r\nby the retiring Senators, and only 119 by those who will hold over, and\r\nwho will sit in the Legislature of 1911. So, on the whole, the machine\r\nloses and the people gain in the retirement of the twenty Senators.\r\n\r\nIn point of numbers the result is as satisfactory. The machine will lose\r\neleven Senators: Bates, Hartman, Kennedy, Leavitt, McCartney, Price,\r\nReily, Savage, Weed, Willis and Wright; while the anti-machine forces\r\nwill lose only seven who can be counted constantly for reform policies:\r\nBell, Black, Boynton, Caminetti, Cartwright, Miller and Sanford.\r\n\r\nThis leaves only Anthony and Curtin to be accounted for. Both these men\r\nstood out against the machine's amendments to the Direct Primary bill,\r\nAnthony in particular standing against the severest pressure that could\r\nbe brought to compel him to vote against the interests of his\r\nconstituents and of the State. But Anthony could not be moved. On the\r\nrailroad measures, however, Anthony voted with the machine. But he voted\r\nfor the Walker-Otis bill, and, generally speaking, for all measures\r\nwhich made for political reforms. With any sort of organization of the\r\nreform forces, Anthony could be counted upon as safe for reform. His\r\nrecord on the Direct Primary bill certainly entitles him to the highest\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nCurtin also was as a general thing with the reform element. He voted,\r\nhowever, against the bill to do away with the party circle and he voted\r\nagainst the Local Option bill, but in so doing he merely followed the\r\nlead of such men as Birdsall, who, while out and out against the\r\nmachine, were at the same time against local option and lukewarm on\r\nballot reform. Birdsall, however, finally voted for the bill to remove\r\nthe party circle from the election ballot, although he had on the first\r\nballot voted against the bill. Curtin did not, however, change his vote.\r\nBut Curtin did vote against the Initiative Amendment. On the other hand,\r\nCurtin's record on the Direct Primary bill, on the Railroad Regulation\r\nbills, and on the Anti-Gambling bill is all that could be desired.\r\n\r\nWhile the retirement of all the Senators who do not hold over would\r\nstrengthen the reform element in the Senate, nevertheless the State can\r\nill afford to lose the services of the seven who stood out so valiantly\r\nagainst machine policies. Senator Bell heads the list, with Caminetti,\r\nBlack, Boynton and Sanford close seconds.\r\n\r\nSenator Bell not only made the best record made in the Senate of 1909,\r\nbut he made the best record of the Senate of 1907. Conscientious, fully\r\nawake to the responsibilities of his position, alive to the tricks of\r\nthe machine leaders, in constant attendance, Senator Bell proved himself\r\nduring the two sessions that he has served in the Senate, a power for\r\ngood government. His absence from the session of 1911 would be a loss to\r\nthe State.\r\n\r\nSenators Black and Boynton at the session of 1909 made records quite as\r\ngood as that made by Senator Bell. On the sixteen roll calls taken as\r\ntests of the standing of the several Senators, Black voted but once\r\nagainst reform policies. On the first ballot on the Party Circle bill he\r\nvoted against the measure, but the day following, corrected his mistake\r\nby voting for the measure. Boynton voted to return the Local Option bill\r\nto the Judiciary Committee, but at the final test his vote was recorded\r\nfor the bill[103a]. Thus neither of the two Senators can be said to have\r\nvoted with the machine even on comparatively unimportant issues.\r\n\r\nSenator Caminetti probably gave the machine more worry during the\r\nsession than any other one Senator. Caminetti has, a way of saying out\r\nloud what his anti-machine associates are thinking, which is not at all\r\npopular with the machine. True to principle, he, a Democrat, voted for\r\nUnited States Senator Perkins because, from Caminetti's view-point, no\r\nother candidate came so near to being the popular choice of the people\r\nas Perkins, and Caminetti holds that the people and not the Legislature\r\nshould select the United States Senator. The machine was glad of\r\nCaminetti's vote for Perkins, but was not at all pleased with the\r\ndeparture of a Democrat voting for a Republican. Caminetti's course\r\ncontinued in by all the members of the Legislature, and the machine\r\nwould lose its monopoly of Federal Senator-making.\r\n\r\nCaminetti's record is admirable. To be sure, he opposed Local Option,\r\nbut he fought as few others fought for an effective Direct Primary law,\r\nfor effective railroad regulation, in fact for practically all the\r\nreform policies which the anti-machine forces advocated and the machine\r\nopposed. Senator Sanford also voted for and worked for reform policies.\r\nLike Caminetti, however, he opposed the Local Option bill and voted\r\nagainst it. Senator Miller, on the other hand, supported the Local\r\nOption bill, but slipped more seriously than did either Caminetti or\r\nSanford, by voting with the machine Senators against the Initiative\r\namendment. Miller's work for effective railroad regulation and for an\r\neffective Direct Primary law, won him the deserved admiration and\r\nconfidence of the better element of the Legislature. Senator Cartwright\r\nvoted but twelve times on the sixteen roll calls, but the twelve\r\nincluded the votes on the Direct Primary issues, on railroad regulation,\r\nand on all the moral issues considered. And each time, Senator\r\nCartwright's vote was cast on the side of good government.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, the machine side, Senator Bates distinguished himself\r\nbut once during the session. It was Senator Bates who, to oblige a\r\nfriend, had the notorious Change of Venue bill placed on the Special\r\nUrgency File, thus making the passage of the bill possible. Senator\r\nBates' vote and influence - such as it was - were thrown in the balance\r\nagainst giving the people of California a State-wide vote - the only\r\npractical vote - for United States Senators. He voted against the\r\neffective Stetson bill; he voted for the ineffective Railroad Regulation\r\nbill. In fact, aside from the Walker-Otis bill, Bates was on the machine\r\nside of practically every issue[104].\r\n\r\nSenator Hartman was during the session a mere machine vote. He was\r\nalways on hand, always voted, and voted with the machine. It was Senator\r\nHartman who named an employee of the notorious Sausalito gambling rooms\r\nfor an important committee clerkship. So far as the writer can recall,\r\nHartman made but two speeches during the session; one against the\r\nWalker-Otis Anti-Gambling bill, one against the Islais Creek Harbor\r\nbill, the passage of which meant so much for San Francisco, the city, by\r\nthe way, responsible for Hartman's presence at Sacramento.\r\n\r\nOn the sixteen roll calls under consideration, Hartman voted sixteen\r\ntimes for machine policies. As a vote, Hartman is a valuable machine\r\nasset; otherwise a nonentity.\r\n\r\nThose who have read the previous chapters have already formed their\r\nopinion of the advisability of returning to the Senate, Kennedy, the\r\nhero of the passage of the Change of Venue bill; McCartney, the author\r\nof the famous amendment to the Direct Primary bill; Weed, who introduced\r\nthe resolution to drag Senator Black from his sick bed at Palo Alto;\r\nReily, who with Senator Hartman, alone of all the Senate stood out\r\nagainst the passage of the Islais Creek Harbor bills; Willis, who as\r\nChairman of the Judiciary Committee, backed such measures as the Change\r\nof Venue bill, and opposed such measures as the Commonwealth Club bills;\r\nSavage, who in committee and out of it, opposed the State-wide vote plan\r\nfor nominating United States Senators, and Senator Price.\r\n\r\nPrice did not distinguish himself particularly. On the sixteen roll\r\ncalls included in Table A, his vote was recorded against the machine as\r\nmany as four times. But there were ten Senators who did even worse.\r\nHowever, a story of the closing days of the session is quite\r\ncharacteristic of Senator Price.\r\n\r\nAn important roll call was on - if the writer remembers correctly, it\r\nwas on Burnett's motion to continue the investigation into the causes of\r\nthe increase of freight and express rates. Price was present, but did\r\nnot answer to the call of his name. The advocates of the resolution\r\ninsisted that all vote, and demanded a call of the Senate. The doors\r\nwere ordered closed, at which order Price made a run for the door.\r\nCaminetti saw the move, understood it and started to intercept the\r\nfleeing Senator. But if Caminetti were quick, Price was quicker.\r\nCaminetti missed his grab at Price, and so chased that gentleman to the\r\ndoor of the Senate chamber. The assistant Sergeant-at-Arms at the door\r\nwas just swinging it closed as Price shot through. The determined\r\nCaminetti made a last grab at Price's coattails, but too late. The\r\nmassive doors banged closed, with Price, coattails and all, on the\r\noutside, and the balked Caminetti on the inside. Price didn't vote on\r\nthat roll call.\r\n\r\nThe failure to return Leavitt to the Senate will be a decided loss for\r\nthe machine, one hard to offset. Next to Wolfe, Leavitt was by far the\r\nablest floor leader in the Senate. The brute force of the man, his\r\ngrossness, his indifference to public opinion, made him an ideal\r\nmachine leader. Leavitt's return from Alameda seems extremely doubtful.\r\nHis district takes in the notorious gambling community, Emeryville,\r\nwhich will be purged of the thug element that has dominated it, by the\r\nenforcement of the Walker-Otis law. With the loss of this portion of\r\nhis constituency, Senator Leavitt's chance of re-election from\r\nEmeryville appears slim indeed.\r\n\r\nBut, according to rather persistent rumor, Senator Leavitt may be\r\nreturned to the Senate, not from Alameda, but from the Siskiyou-Shasta\r\nDistrict, the district represented by Weed. Leavitt has property up\r\nthere, and the story runs that he will be a candidate from that part of\r\nthe State. The voters of Shasta and Siskiyou, however, may conclude that\r\nthey have something to say about it.\r\n\r\nSenator Wright, the last of the Senators whose terms will have expired\r\nbefore the next session of the Legislature convenes, is being mentioned\r\nas a \"reform candidate\" for Governor. The idea seems to be that he will\r\nrun on his record made at the session of 1909. If this be true, he may\r\nnot be a candidate for re-election to the Senate. Senator Wright's\r\nrecord as a State Senator has already been treated at length.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[103a] Senator Boynton was a consistent supporter of the Local Option\r\nbill from the beginning to the end of the session. He held, however,\r\nthat the bill as originally drawn was not in proper form, and explained\r\nthat he voted to have the bill returned to the committee that\r\namendments, which he deemed necessary, could be made.\r\n\r\n[104] Since the Legislature adjourned Senator Bates has been given a\r\nlucrative position in the United States Mint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXVIII.\r\n\r\nConclusion.\r\n\r\nEvents of the Session of 1909 Show That Before Any Effective Reform Can\r\nBe Brought About in California, Good Government Republicans and\r\nDemocrats Must Unite to Organize Senate and Assembly - Appointment of\r\nSenate Committees May Be Taken Out of the Hands of the\r\nLieutenant-Governor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the opening chapter it was stated that the machine element in the\r\nLegislature of 1909, although in the minority, defeated the purposes of\r\nthe reform majority, because of three principal reasons:\r\n\r\n(1) The reform element was without organization.\r\n\r\n(2) The reform members had, except in the anti-racetrack gambling fight,\r\nno definite plan of action.\r\n\r\n(3) The reform members of both Houses permitted the machine to name\r\npresiding officers and appoint committees.\r\n\r\nThis third reason must appeal to those who have read the foregoing pages\r\nas the most important of all. The story of every machine success, in\r\nface of opposition, is that of advantage gained through the moral\r\nsupport given by the presiding officers[105], or of co-operation of\r\ncommittees, or of both. But, unfortunately, a stupid partisanship - a\r\npartisanship which the machine finds far more potent than bribe money -\r\nmakes this cause of machine success more difficult to overcome than\r\neither of the others. Already a movement is on foot, the details of\r\nwhich the writer is not at liberty to make public, that will unite the\r\nreform element of the next Legislature into a working body, from the day\r\nnominations are made. Steps to this end were taken before the last\r\nLegislature adjourned. In the same way, the work of bringing reform\r\nissues before the public - reform of the ballot laws, amendment of the\r\nDirect Primary law, the simplification of the mode of criminal procedure\r\n- is being taken up in the same effective, commonsense way as was the\r\nAnti-Racetrack Gambling bill. But here the progress of the commonsense\r\nelement of machine opposition seems to halt. In spite of their\r\nexperience of the last session, Democrats and Republicans who stand for\r\ngood government hesitate at the suggestion of non-partisan organization\r\nof Senate and Assembly. The writer has shown in the foregoing chapters\r\nthat the machine Republicans and the machine Democrats were for\r\npractical purposes a unit in the organization of the Legislature of\r\n1909. Why, then, should not the anti-machine Republicans and the\r\nanti-machine Democrats unite for purposes of organization, just as they\r\nunited, at the session of 1909, to oppose vicious measures and to work\r\nfor the passage of good bills? That is a question which has never been\r\nsatisfactorily answered. It leads us, however, to the question of the\r\nreal line of division in Senate and Assembly, and, for that matter, in\r\nState politics[106].\r\n\r\nThat the real division is no longer between political parties, or even\r\nbetween party factions, is apparent to the observer who has given the\r\nquestion any attention at all.\r\n\r\nNot once, for example, did the California Legislature of 1909 divide on\r\na party question; nor did it have to deal with any problem that had not\r\nat one time or another been endorsed by both parties. Both Democrats and\r\nRepublicans in either State or county platforms had declared for the\r\npassage of an Anti-Racetrack Gambling law, for an effective Direct\r\nPrimary law, for an effective Railroad Regulation law, for the\r\nsubmission to the people of a Constitutional Amendment granting the\r\npeople the privilege of initiating laws. In the same way, county\r\nconventions of both parties - and county conventions are the closest to\r\nthe people and most representative of them - had declared for local\r\noption, for the election of United States Senators by direct vote of the\r\npeople, for amendments to the codes that should simplify proceedings in\r\ncriminal cases, for effective railroad regulation. Estimating the\r\npurposes of the two parties by their county and State platforms, none of\r\nthese reforms can be regarded as any more Democratic than Republican,\r\nand these were the issues with which the Legislature of 1909 was called\r\nupon to deal.\r\n\r\nA glance at the tables of votes in the appendix will show that the\r\nAssemblymen and the Senators who voted against the Anti-Racetrack\r\nGambling bill, generally speaking, voted against the effective Stetson\r\nRailroad Regulation bill and for the ineffective Wright bill, opposed\r\nthe provision in the Direct Primary bill giving the people an effective\r\npart in the selection of United States Senators, supported the passage\r\nof the Change of Venue bill, opposed the passage of the Local Option\r\nbill, opposed the submission of the Initiative amendment to the electors\r\nof the State. This negative element, opposed to policies which the\r\nnormal citizen regards as making for the State's best interests, has in\r\nthese pages been called the machine[107].\r\n\r\nAs has been shown in these pages, the interests of the several\r\nbeneficiaries of the system are in effect pooled; one element helps the\r\nother. The managers of the several elements, the political agents, if\r\nyou like, of the tenderloin, Southern Pacific, racetrack, and\r\npublic-service monopolies generally; in a word, all who seek to evade\r\nthe law or to secure undue special privileges or to continue secure in\r\nthe possession of such privileges already secured, recognize that they\r\nmust hang together or submit to a reckoning with the public, which must\r\nnecessarily result in the breaking of the particular monopoly which each\r\nenjoys, be it in transportation, nickel-in-the-slot graft, or traffic in\r\nthe bodies of young women. Should the political bureau of the Southern\r\nPacific Railroad Company, for example, lose the support of the\r\ntenderloin, or of the racetrack gamblers, or of any other powerful group\r\nof its political associates, the corporation could no longer continue\r\nits strangle-hold upon the State. But none of its associates would dare\r\nthus offend. Such is the machine, which, in the name of a protective\r\ntariff, \"sound money,\" Abraham Lincoln, or Theodore Roosevelt, has\r\norganized the Legislature of California for sixteen years. Previous to\r\n1895, there were California Legislatures organized in the name of Thomas\r\nJefferson. But the machine has not taken the name of Thomas Jefferson in\r\nvain in California for many years[108].\r\n\r\nNevertheless, although acting under the name Republican, the machine is\r\nquite as dependent upon \"Democrats\" as upon \"Republicans,\" and as\r\ndependent upon either as upon the tenderloin, the brewery trust or the\r\nracetrack gambling element. It monopolizes neither party, but it divides\r\nboth parties. Or it may be described as a canker that has eaten into\r\nboth, diseased both, rendered both unwholesome, until a condition exists\r\nin the dominating parties that requires that the uncorrupted element of\r\nboth unite to cut the diseased portion away[109].\r\n\r\nAs the machine divides the parties, so did it divide the Republican and\r\nDemocratic delegations in the Senate and the Assembly of the California\r\nLegislature of 1909. Hare and Kennedy, for example, Democratic Senators,\r\nvoted constantly with Wolfe and Leavitt, Republican Senators, for\r\nmachine policies. Nor was the opposition restricted to party lines.\r\nBlack and Boynton and Cutten, Republican Senators, were found voting\r\nconstantly with Campbell and Holohan, Democratic Senators, against the\r\nmachine. Between Black and Wolfe, Republicans, there was nothing in\r\ncommon during the entire session; nor was there anything in common\r\nbetween Campbell and Kennedy, Democrats. On practically every important\r\nissue, however, Kennedy, Democrat, and Wolfe, Republican, made common\r\ncause, while Black, Republican, and Campbell, Democrat, opposed them.\r\n\r\nThe same comparisons could be made in the Assembly, where such Democrats\r\nas Wheelan and Baxter were found with Mott and Coghlan, Republicans,\r\nsupporting machine policies, while opposed to them were anti-machine\r\nRepublicans of the character of Bohnett and Callan, and anti-machine\r\nDemocrats like Polsley and Mendenhall.\r\n\r\nThus, for practical purposes, the Legislature can not be divided on\r\nparty lines. The only practical line of division is between the machine\r\nelement, and the anti-machine element. Such, at the session of 1909, was\r\nthe division on every important issue; such will it be at the\r\nlegislative session of 1911. Why should not the same division govern the\r\norganization of Senate and Assembly?\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the machine disregards party lines even in\r\norganizing. In making up its committees it considers fealty to machine\r\ninterests above party name. For example, Hare and Kennedy were the\r\nDemocratic Senators who this year affiliated with the machine. Kennedy\r\nwas appointed to practically every important committee, at least to\r\nthose before which important fights were to be made. Thus we find him on\r\nthe Committee on Commerce and Navigation, Contingent Expenses, Elections\r\nand Election Laws, Prisons and Reformatories, and Public Morals, Hare\r\nwas appointed to the Committee on Commerce and Navigation, Elections and\r\nElection Laws, Labor, Capital and Immigration, Municipal Corporations,\r\nPrinting, and Public Buildings and Grounds. In committees, as well as on\r\nthe floor of the Senate, Hare and Kennedy were found as a general thing\r\ncasting their influence and their votes on the side of machine policies.\r\n\r\nHad the anti-machine Democrats and the anti-machine Republicans in\r\nSenate and Assembly, who worked together for the same ends and voted\r\ntogether on practically every important issue, taken the same course,\r\nand united for the organization of the two Houses, reform measures which\r\nwere defeated by narrow margins would have been made laws, and machine\r\nmeasures which became laws defeated.\r\n\r\nSuch being the case, is it not the duty of the anti-machine Republicans\r\nand the anti-machine Democrats who may sit in the Legislature of 1911,\r\nto organize both Senate and Assembly to resist machine purposes and\r\npolicies?\r\n\r\nThis can be done comparatively easily in the Assembly, where a movement\r\nto elect the Speaker such as was started by Drew of Fresno this year, if\r\ncarried out, would take the Assembly out of machine hands. Although the\r\norganization of the Senate looks more difficult, because the Senate has\r\nno voice in the selection of its presiding officer, nevertheless, even\r\nthough a Warren Porter occupy the post of Lieutenant-Governor, at the\r\nsession of 1911 the reform element can elect its President pro tem., and\r\nappoint the Senate committees. In other words, a majority of the Senate,\r\nmay if it see fit, take the appointing of the committees out of the\r\nhands of the Lieutenant-Governor.\r\n\r\nThere are two important precedents for this course, one established by a\r\nDemocratic Senate; the other by a Republican Senate.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic precedent was established in 1887. In that year Robert W.\r\nWaterman, a Republican, was Lieutenant-Governor and presiding officer of\r\nthe Senate. The Senate was made up of twenty-six Democrats and fourteen\r\nRepublicans. The Democratic majority organized the Senate under the\r\nfollowing rule, which will be found in the Senate journal of that\r\nsession:\r\n\r\n\"All Committees of the Senate, special and standing, and all joint\r\nCommittees on the part thereof, shall be elected by the Senate unless\r\notherwise ordered.\"\r\n\r\nThe Republican precedent was made in 1897. In that year, William T.\r\nJeter, a Democrat, was Lieutenant-Governor, while a majority of the\r\nSenators were Republicans. Instead of leaving the appointing of the\r\ncommittees to the Democratic Lieutenant-Governor, the Republican\r\nSenators adopted a rule that \"all standing committees of the Senate\r\nshall be named by the Senate, unless otherwise ordered, and the first\r\nnamed shall be chairman thereof. All other committees shall be appointed\r\nin such manner as the Senate shall determine.\"\r\n\r\nIn other words, the Republican majority of the Senate named the Senate\r\ncommittees of the session of 1897, taking their appointment out of the\r\nhands of the Lieutenant-Governor as the Democrats had done ten years\r\nbefore. There is no good reason why the members of the anti-machine\r\nmajority in the Senate should not have taken the same course in 1909,\r\nand named the committees. Had they done so, and named the President pro\r\ntem., they would have organized the Senate in the interest of those\r\npolicies in advancing which they were soon in open revolt against\r\nLieutenant-Governor Porter, the machine Senators and the machine lobby.\r\nFailing to do so, they placed themselves under a handicap which they\r\nwere unable to overcome.\r\n\r\nThe reform element of the Legislature of 1911 will have in the\r\nexperience of the reform element of the session of 1909, an important\r\nlesson. And The People of California, who will elect that Legislature,\r\nhave a lesson as important. The successes of the machine at the session\r\nof 1909, where a clear majority of both Houses opposed machine policies,\r\ndemonstrated that the well-being of the State requires that the\r\nopponents of the machine in Senate and Assembly, regardless of party\r\nlabel, organize the Legislature. But back of this is the even more\r\nimportant requirement that there be elected to the Legislature American\r\ncitizens, with the responsibility of their citizenship upon them, rather\r\nthan partisans, burdened until their good purposes are made negative, by\r\nthe responsibility of their partisanship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[105] See, for example, Speaker Stanton's ruling on the Direct Primary\r\nbill when the Assembly was considering the question of receding from its\r\namendments.\r\n\r\n[106] The machine recognizes the real division, if the reform element\r\ndoes not. The machine, for example, calls itself Republican, and as such\r\ncontrols the patronage of the San Francisco water front. The\r\nappointments to water front jobs are, of course, partisan, but the\r\nwriter is reliably informed that as many \"Democrats\" as \"Republicans\"\r\nare employed there. Senators Hare and Kennedy, we have seen, although\r\nDemocrats, got appointments to holdover committees. The machine\r\nrecognizes but one line in politics, that which divides those who\r\nsupport machine policies from those who stand for good government and\r\nthe square deal. When those who stand for good government and the square\r\ndeal become as clear sighted, the fight against the machine will not be\r\nquite so unequal.\r\n\r\n[107] The term \"machine\" is, as a general thing, rather lightly used. It\r\nis made to stand for everything, from what might be and should be\r\nperfectly legitimate party organization, to the Southern Pacific\r\npolitical bureau. The Southern Pacific political bureau is, as a matter\r\nof fact, the dominating factor in machine affairs, which gives some\r\nreason for dubbing the machine Southern Pacific. But it is nor more the\r\nSouthern Pacific machine than it is the Tenderloin machine or the\r\nRacetrack gamblers' machine, or the United Railroads machine, or the\r\nElectric Power Trust machine.\r\n\r\n[108] Bryce in his American Commonwealth, more than a quarter of a\r\ncentury ago, showed the hollowness of the contention of the machine\r\nelement for arty consideration. \"The interest of a Boss in political\r\nquestions,\" said Bryce in one of his admirable chapters on this subject,\r\n\"is usually quite secondary. Here and there one may be found and who is\r\na politician in the European sense, who, whether sincerely or not,\r\npurports and professes to be interested in some principle or measure\r\naffecting the welfare of the country. But the attachment of the ringster\r\nis usually given wholly to the concrete party, that is, to the men who\r\ncompose it, regarded as office-holders or office-seekers; and there is\r\noften not even a profession of zeal for any party doctrine. As a noted\r\npolitician happily observed to a friend of mine: 'You know, Mr. R.,\r\nthere are no politics in politics.' \"\r\n\r\n[109] One has a wider view of this condition if he look out beyond the\r\nSacramento Capitol, into the Senate Hall at Washington. The following is\r\nfrom an editorial article which appeared in the Saturday Evening Post,\r\nof June 12 last:\r\n\r\n\"The Iron trade is still in a depressed state. Output is much below the\r\ncapacity of the mills, and prices have not recovered from the\r\ndemoralization of early spring. Yet the other day the common stock of\r\nthe Steel Trust sold higher than ever before. When issued, this common\r\nstock was rather thinner than water, and it represented mostly a\r\ncapitalization of the Trust's tariff graft. At the new high price the\r\nmarket valuation of the graft, therefore, is some three hundred million\r\ndollars. A few days before this new high price was made, eighteen\r\nDemocratic Senators voted with the Aldrich Republicans to take iron ore\r\nfrom the free list - where the House bill had put it - and protect it by\r\na substantial duty. This action was generally regarded as insuring a\r\ncontinuation of the Trust's tariff graft. Hence a record price for the\r\ncommon stock was logical enough, although the iron trade was not exactly\r\nflourishing at the moment.\r\n\r\n\"Similar acts by Democratic Senators were denounced by President\r\nCleveland as party perfidy and dishonor; but the regrettable fact is\r\nthere is only one party in the United States Senate - just one party,\r\nwith some scattering Republicans and Democratic Insurgents. For the\r\npurpose of getting elected and making stump speeches, different labels\r\nand catchwords are employed; but when it comes down to real business in\r\nthe matter of taxing eighty-odd million users of iron and steel products\r\nfor the benefit of an opulent trust, we find forty-three Republican\r\nSenators and eighteen Democratic Senators staunchly voting aye, against\r\nfourteen Republicans and ten Democrats who vote nay.\r\n\r\n\"With over half of the Democratic members of the Upper House fondly\r\nrecording themselves as Little Brothers to Protection, there is slight\r\ndanger that the tariff will be revised otherwise than by its friends.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppendix\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTables of Votes.\r\n\r\nThe test votes given in the several tables record in every instance the\r\nresult of a contest between the machine and the anti-machine forces in\r\nSenate or Assembly. It is quite evident that a unanimous vote cannot be\r\ncounted a test vote. Thus the unanimous vote by which the Reciprocal\r\nDemurrage bill passed the Senate cannot be regarded as a test, although\r\nthe machine fought the demurrage principle viciously in 1907.\r\n\r\nNor can a vote on a measure be taken as a test vote, where the vote was\r\ntaken without the members fully realizing what was before them. Thus the\r\nvotes on the Wheelan bills do not appear in either Senate or Assembly\r\ntables. These measures were slipped through Senate and Assembly without\r\nthe members of either House fully realizing what the bills were, their\r\npurpose, or far-reaching effects. To be sure, a member of the\r\nLegislature should know what he is voting on, but when one considers the\r\nincidents of the whirl-wind close of the session of 1909, the injustice\r\nof holding a member accountable for inadvertently voting for a measure\r\nwhich he had intended to oppose, becomes apparent.\r\n\r\nFollowing this rule, a vote on a given measure may be a test vote in one\r\nHouse and not in the other. The Change of Venue bill is an example in\r\npoint. The Change of Venue bill was slipped through the Assembly,\r\nwithout the members fully realizing its import, and hence without\r\nopposition. But in the Senate the issue was fought out. The Senate vote\r\non the Change of Venue bill, then, is taken as a test vote, while the\r\nAssembly vote on the same measure is not so regarded. In the same way,\r\nthe vote on the substitution of the Wright bill for the Stetson Railroad\r\nRegulation bill was a test vote in the Senate. But in the Assembly there\r\nwas no test vote taken on the railroad regulation measures, for the\r\nWright bill was put through practically without opposition. The test\r\nrailroad vote in the Assembly came on the Sanford resolution providing\r\nfor government steamships on the Pacific. There was no test vote on this\r\nin the Senate, for in the Senate it was adopted practically without\r\nopposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable A - Records of Senators.\r\n\r\nThe records of the members of the Senate on sixteen test votes are shown\r\nin Table A. The names of the Senators are arranged in the order of the\r\nnumber of times their votes were recorded on the side of progress and\r\nreform, the name of the Senator with the most positive votes to his\r\ncredit appearing at the top of the list, and the Senator with the least\r\nnumber at the bottom.\r\n\r\nWhile few will quarrel with the fact that Senator Bell's name leads the\r\nlist, while Senators Finn and Hartman divide negative honors at the\r\nbottom, nevertheless the arrangement is not, strictly speaking, fair,\r\nalthough it is probably as fair as it could be made.\r\n\r\nSenator Walker, for example, has only one anti-reform vote registered\r\nagainst him, but it was, perhaps, the most important test vote of the\r\nsession, that on the Railroad Regulation measures. Senator Cutten, on\r\nthe other hand, voted on the reform side of every question with the\r\nexception of the measure intended to work political reform by removing\r\nthe party circle from the election ballot. Senator Cutten is recorded\r\ntwice against this bill, it being necessary, in justice to all the\r\nSenators, to give both the votes taken on this measure. But considering\r\nthe relative importance of the Railroad Regulation bills and the Party\r\nCircle bill, all must admit that Senator Cutten made a better record\r\nthan Senator Walker, although Cutten's name appears below that of\r\nWalker.\r\n\r\nUnavoidable absence from the Senate Chamber cut down the records of\r\nseveral of the Senators. Black and Stetson, whose severe illness kept\r\nthem from Sacramento toward the end of the session, furnish examples of\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nThen again, the Party Circle bill and the Local Option bill were\r\nmeasures on which several of the strongest of the opponents of the\r\nmachine differed with the majority of their anti-machine associates.\r\nWith the four votes taken on these two issues out of the reckoning,\r\nBell, Thompson, Roseberry, Cutten, Campbell, Boynton, Sanford,\r\nCartwright, Black, Holohan, Birdsall, Stetson, Rush and Strobridge, have\r\nnot one vote for a machine-backed policy against them. Caminetti's vote\r\nto amend the Stanford bill excludes him from the list, but as this\r\nmeasure was of the same character and policy as the Local Option bill,\r\nCaminetti's name should in justice be included among those of the\r\nSenators who made practically clear records. Looking at the table in a\r\nbroad way, the first nineteen Senators of the list made anti-machine\r\nrecords. Of the eleven caucus Republicans among them, only one voted\r\nagainst admitting Bell to the Republican caucus.\r\n\r\nThe nineteen voted for the Anti-Racetrack Gambling bill, they voted\r\nevery time against the machine on the Direct Primary issue, only two of\r\nthem voted for the Change of Venue bill, only two of them voted against\r\nthe Railroad Regulation bill. These comparisons can be carried out\r\nindefinitely, and always to the advantage of the nineteen.\r\n\r\nSenator Wright is twentieth on the list; Senator Anthony is\r\ntwenty-first. Those who followed these two Senators through the Direct\r\nPrimary bill fight will see immediately that Wright has crowded into\r\nundeserved standing. There is a very good reason for this. In the\r\nSenate, the roll of Senators is called alphabetically, and Senator\r\nWright's name is the last on the list. A glance at the table will show\r\nthat Senator Wright did not vote once against the machine when his vote\r\nwould have decided the issue. He voted for the Anti-Racetrack Gambling\r\nbill, but before him thirty-two Senators had voted for the bill, and\r\nonly seven against it. Wright's thirty-third affirmative vote counted\r\nfor nothing. On the other hand, when Wright's name was reached on roll\r\ncall on the Change of Venue bill, with the vote standing nineteen for\r\nthe bill and sixteen against, and twenty-one votes necessary for its\r\npassage, Senator Wright cast the twentieth affirmative vote, thus\r\nensuring the measure's passage. In the same way, Senator Wright's vote\r\nthe following day, tied the score on the motion for a call of the\r\nSenate, thus defeating the motion, and preventing reconsideration of the\r\nChange of Venue bill which would have meant its defeat.\r\n\r\nThe query is: Had the vote on the Anti-Racetrack Gambling bill stood\r\nnineteen against the bill, and twenty for, when Wright's name was\r\nreached, with twenty-one votes necessary for its passage, would Wright's\r\nvote have been cast for or against it? Any person who has any doubt on\r\nthe question, is referred to Senator Wright's part in the passage of the\r\namended Direct Primary bill, and in the defeat of the Stetson bill.\r\n\r\nIt is most advantageous to have one's name at the bottom of a roll call.\r\nSenator Wright's position above that of Senators Anthony and Burnett,\r\nemphasizes the necessity of considering these tables in connection with\r\nthe chapters dealing with the several issues involved. From the first\r\ndays of the session Senators Anthony and Burnett gave indications that\r\nhad the anti-machine forces been organized, they would have been found\r\nconsistently against the machine. At any rate, their records are\r\nadmittedly more creditable than that made by Senator Wright.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sixteen Test Votes.\r\n\r\nSenator Bell did not vote in the Senate Republican caucus, nor did the\r\nnine Democratic Senators. Thus in the sixteen votes recorded, Bell and\r\nthe Democratic members voted only fifteen times. An outline of each of\r\nthe several issues involved follows:\r\n\r\nSenate A - The first test vote of the Republican majority which came in\r\nthe Republican caucus described in Chapter II, on motion to admit\r\nSenator Bell to caucus privileges. Lost by a vote of 16 to 14.\r\n\r\nSenate B - Vote on proposed McCartney Amendments to Direct Primary bill.\r\nAmendments defeated by vote of 27 to 13. See Chapter IX.\r\n\r\nSenate C - Senate vote on Anti-Racetrack Gambling bill. See Chapter VII.\r\n\r\nSenate D - Vote on Wolfe's motion to send the Local Option bill back to\r\nthe Judiciary Committee. See Chapter XVIII.\r\n\r\nSenate E - First vote on Senate Bill 220, abolishing the party circle on\r\nthe election ballot. Measure was defeated by vote of 15 to 23.\r\n\r\nSenate F - Vote by which the above Senate Bill 220 was passed on\r\nreconsideration. Note the Senators who changed to the side favoring the\r\nmeasure.\r\n\r\nSenate G - Test vote on Senate Bill 1144, known as the \"Stanford Bill,\"\r\nwhich prohibited the sale of intoxicants within a mile and a half of a\r\nUniversity. The measure was aimed at the low groggeries maintained in\r\nthe vicinity of the campus at Stanford. It was fought by the same\r\ntenderloin element that had opposed the Anti-Racetrack Gambling bill.\r\nSenator Wolfe moved to amend the measure to exclude fraternal club\r\nhouses and hotels of fifty bed-rooms or more, from its provisions. The\r\namendment would have delayed and perhaps defeated the bill. Wolfe's\r\nmotion was defeated.\r\n\r\nSenate H - Vote by which the above Senate Bill 1144 was finally passed.\r\n\r\nSenate I - First test railroad vote in the Senate - Senator Stetson\r\nmoved that Stetson bill be substituted for the Wright bill. The motion\r\nwas defeated by a vote of 16 to 22. Had Rush and Roseberry been present\r\nthey would have voted on the side of the Stetson measure. This would\r\nhave made the vote twenty-two for the Wright bill, and eighteen for the\r\nStetson bill. See Chapter XIII.\r\n\r\nSenate J - Vote on the Initiative Amendment. See Chapter XIX.\r\n\r\nSenate K - Vote on the Local Option bill. See Chapter XVIII.\r\n\r\nSenate L - Vote on Senate Constitutional Amendment No. 4, to eliminate\r\nambiguities from those sections of the State Constitution which\r\nprescribe the powers and duties of the Railroad Commission. See Chapter\r\nXIV.\r\n\r\nSenate M - Vote on Assembly amendments to the Direct Primary bill.\r\nWright moved that the Senate concur in the amendments. The motion was\r\nlost, but on Wolfe's motion to reconsider the vote, the Senate was held\r\nin deadlock for more than a week. See Chapters X and XI.\r\n\r\nSenate N - Vote on Change of Venue bill. See Chapter XVI.\r\n\r\nSenate O - Vote on motion to reconsider vote by which Change of Venue\r\nbill was passed. See Chapter XVI.\r\n\r\nSenate P - Vote on Burnett's motion that the investigation into the\r\ncauses for the increase of freight and express rates be continued after\r\nthe Legislature adjourned. See Chapter XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTables B and C - Record of Assemblymen.\r\n\r\nThe two tables showing the votes of the members of the Assembly include\r\neleven test votes. The names of the Assemblymen are arranged as in the\r\ncase of the Senators with the names of those who made the best records\r\nat the top.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that fourteen Assemblymen voted against the machine on\r\nevery roll call, eight were absent on one roll call each, but voted the\r\nten times they were present against the machine, while three members\r\nvoted 'once each with the machine, and ten times against it. These\r\ntwenty-five members, voting 267 times, cast 264 votes on the side of\r\nprogress and reform, and three votes for machine policies. The record\r\nindicates what might have been done in the Assembly had the reform\r\nforces been organized. Indeed, the forty leading Assemblymen, casting\r\n421 votes, cast only 48 votes for machine policies and 373 against.\r\n\r\nThe same considerations governed the selection of test votes in the\r\nAssembly as in the Senate. The votes are as follows:\r\n\r\nAssembly A - The first test vote in the Assembly was on Drew's\r\nresolution to reject the report of the Committee on Rules. The\r\nresolution was adopted, and the machine's plan to force \"gag rules\" on\r\nthe Assembly failed. See Chapter III Organization of the Assembly.\r\n\r\nAssembly B - The test vote on the Anti-Racetrack Gambling bill. The\r\nCommittee on Public Morals had recommended that the bill \"do pass.\" Mott\r\nmoved that the bill be re-referred to the committee. Motion lost by a\r\nvote of 53 to 23. See Chapter VII.\r\n\r\nAssembly C - Vote on the Anti-Racetrack Gambling bill. See Chapter VII.\r\n\r\nAssembly D - Vote on motion to reconsider the vote by which the\r\nAnti-Racetrack Gambling bill was passed. See Chapter VII.\r\n\r\nAssembly E - The test railroad vote in the Assembly came on Drew's\r\nmotion to recall Senate Joint Resolution No. 3 from committee. The\r\nresolution called for a line of government-owned steamships on the\r\nPacific from San Francisco to Panama. The resolution, having been\r\nadopted by the Senate, went to the Assembly and was referred to the\r\nCommittee on Federal Relations. To hasten action on the resolution, Drew\r\nmoved that it be recalled from the committee. A two-thirds vote was\r\nnecessary for Drew's motion to prevail. The motion failed to carry by a\r\nvote of 36 for to 29 against.\r\n\r\nAssembly F - Vote on motion to strike out of Senate joint Resolution No.\r\n3-considered under E - those sections which referred to Commissioner\r\nBristow's report recommending that the Government steamship line be\r\nestablished, and criticizing the combinations made between the several\r\ntransportation companies. The motion prevailed by a vote of 43 to 30.\r\n\r\nAssembly G - Assembly test vote on the Direct Primary bill. Vote taken\r\non Leed's motion that vote on United States Senators be advisory and by\r\ndistricts. The motion prevailed by a vote of 38 to 36. See Chapter X.\r\n\r\nAssembly H - Vote on proposed amendments to the Islais Creek Harbor\r\nbill. Motion was made to amend by substituting 44 blocks for the 63\r\nnecessary for the improvement. Had this been done, the work would have\r\nbeen made impracticable. Motion lost by a vote of 30 to 45. See Chapter\r\nXXIII, \"Influence of the San Francisco Delegation.\"\r\n\r\nAssembly I - Leeds moved that Senate Bill 220 removing the party circle\r\nfrom the election ballot be denied second reading. The motion prevailed\r\nby a vote of thirty-six for, to thirty-five against.\r\n\r\nAssembly J - Vote on Senate Bill 1144 (the Stanford bill), to prohibit\r\nthe sale of intoxicants within a mile and a half of Stanford University.\r\n\r\nAssembly K - Vote on the Judicial Column bill. This measure provided\r\nthat the names of candidates for the Judiciary be placed in a separate\r\nnon-partisan column on the election ballot. The bill passed the Senate,\r\nbut was defeated in the Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Other Tables.\r\n\r\nTable D shows the six votes on the Anti-Racetrack Gambling bill. See\r\nChapter VII.\r\n\r\nTables E and F - Show the records of the San Francisco delegation in the\r\nSenate and Assembly.

H. Roseberry, Who Introduced the Postal Direct Primary\r\nBill at the Session of 1909.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the full purpose and effect of the proposed\r\nPostal Direct Primary law, it is necessary to ascertain the purpose of\r\nany system of nominations by a Direct Primary.\r\n\r\nThe sole complaint against the present system of nominations by\r\nconventions is based upon the objection that party nominations are made\r\nby a few interested parties, and that the popular choice is absolutely\r\nignored. To remedy this evil the system of direct nominations by the\r\nvoters has been suggested at primary elections. It therefore follows\r\nthat that system, or primary, which will get out the largest number of\r\nvotes or the greatest expression of the people on the choice of\r\ncandidates is, of necessity, the best primary law. If it is true that\r\nall present direct primaries, which provide for voting at a certain time\r\nand place in person, in the form that general elections are now\r\nconducted, only draw out a little over one-half of the registered vote\r\nof all parties, it then follows beyond question, that all present direct\r\nprimary laws are only half successful. Upon an examination of statistics\r\ngathered from the various States in which direct primary laws are now in\r\noperation, it is seen that only 55% to 60% of the registered vote within\r\nthose States has ever been cast at any single primary election. For\r\ninstance, at the primary election held in the State of Oregon in the\r\nfall of 1908, 55% of the registered Republican vote was cast, and less\r\nthan 25% of the Democratic vote. In the State of Washington about 57% of\r\nthe registered vote was cast in 1908, the only vote yet taken under the\r\nnew Direct Primary law. In the State of Wisconsin, while 60% of the\r\ntotal registered vote was cast in 1906, only a little over 40% was cast\r\nat the primary election held In the year 1908. Other statistics could be\r\noffered from all the other States, having the direct primary system of\r\nnominations, from which it would appear that practically a little over\r\n55% or even less of the registered vote has been secured at any direct\r\nprimary election. Therefore, based upon these figures, it becomes patent\r\nthat the present form of direct nominations, to wit: voting at a certain\r\ntime and place in person only, under the same rules and regulations as\r\nat general elections, is only half successful.\r\n\r\nIt was for the purpose of bringing out at least a part of this great\r\nunvoted 45% of qualified electors, to take a part in naming the\r\ncandidates who should go before the people at the general elections,\r\nthat the Postal Direct Primary law was conceived.\r\n\r\nWhile there is no present example of the working of a system of direct\r\nnominations through a ballot cast through the mails for public\r\nofficials, there are a number of instances in which ballots are being\r\ntaken by mail with wonderful success and completeness. Formerly, labor\r\nunions, fraternal societies, chambers of commerce, Granger\r\norganizations, alumni associations, and other civic, religious and\r\nbenevolent associations, balloted on propositions submitted to their\r\nmembership in the form that primary and general elections are now held\r\nin public elections. The vote secured from their memberships was so\r\nmeager and unsatisfactory that the system of voting by mail was\r\ninaugurated, and with such splendid results, that now it is being used\r\nexclusively by a majority of the above organizations, as a method of\r\nvoting upon propositions and officers coming before them for election.\r\nWhere only 10% to 15% of the votes were cast under the old plan of\r\nvoting in person at a particular time and place, 75%, and even 90% of\r\nthe votes are now cast through the mails, and it is significant to note\r\nthat the plan of voting by mail has been found by the organizations\r\nusing it to be free from any objections. This fact, together with the\r\nunanimous vote cast, led to the idea of casting votes by mail at direct\r\nprimaries for the nomination of public officers by political parties.\r\nThe system that has been proposed is extremely simple, and it appears\r\nhighly reasonable and practicable. A short outline of the provisions of\r\nthe bill will assist in an understanding of the arguments offered in its\r\nfavor and those advanced to refute the objections urged against this\r\nPostal Direct Primary Act.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, each elector, at the time of registering, declares\r\nhis party allegiance, and this is entered upon his original affidavit of\r\nregistration. At the same time, he is given a party voting number, which\r\nis written or printed upon his affidavit of registration. The Secretary\r\nof State, every four years, declares the color of ballots to be used by\r\neach party separately. For instance, all Republican ballots throughout\r\nthe State, at every election must be printed upon pink colored paper and\r\nnone other; the Democratic ballot upon white colored paper and none\r\nother, and so on among the other political parties.\r\n\r\nIn order for a candidate's name to be proposed to go on to the primary\r\nballot, it must be proposed by a prescribed number of qualified\r\nelectors, within the district in which that candidate is to be elected,\r\nwhich names must be subscribed to a verified petition. This entitles the\r\ncandidate's name to be printed upon the primary ballot. Within ten days\r\nbefore the primary, or return day, the clerk of the board or body which\r\nis delegated by law to prepare for election matters must print, prepare\r\nand send out, primary election ballots for each separate political party\r\nthrough the United States mails in the following manner: To each elector\r\nwithin the jurisdiction is mailed a plain unmarked envelope, addressed\r\nto the business or home address of each separate elector, containing a\r\nself-addressed and stamped return envelope, returnable to the Board of\r\nElection of that precinct, together with one party primary election\r\nballot, for the use of that elector. If the elector happens to be a\r\nRepublican the color of his ballot will be pink, and only the names of\r\nthe Republican candidates will be printed thereon. On the outside end of\r\nthe ballot is printed the elector's party voting number, which voting\r\nnumber is separate and distinct from every other voting number in that\r\nprecinct. On the outside end of the return envelope is a line left for\r\nthe original signature of the elector to whom the ballot is mailed,\r\nwhereon he must either subscribe his signature in ink, or if he be an\r\nincapable voter, and is assisted, must have his own name subscribed\r\nthereon, together with the names of two freeholders in that precinct,\r\nwho assisted him in voting. Upon receipt of the envelope containing his\r\nballot, the voter marks a cross (X) at the names of the candidates for\r\nwhom he votes, and then folds his ballot so that all the names thereon\r\nare turned inside and out of sight, and his party voting number appears\r\non the outside end of the envelope. (In the same manner that he now\r\nfolds his ballot at a general election.) He then encloses this ballot in\r\nthe stamped return envelope, seals the same, signs his name on the end\r\nof the envelope, and deposits it in a postoffice box. It then goes to\r\nthe postoffice directed by law, addressed to the Primary or Return\r\nBoard, who alone are authorized by law to receive these envelopes from\r\nthe postmaster, and then only on the day and hour designated by law and\r\nin public. Upon return day, the Board receives all of these primary\r\nelection envelopes from the postoffice, takes them to a public place,\r\nand after counting the number received, and comparing with the number\r\noriginally sent out, compares each signature on each envelope with the\r\nsame signature subscribed on the original affidavit of registration, and\r\nif it be genuine, opening the envelope, removing the ballot therefrom,\r\nwithout opening the same, observing that the color of the ballot\r\ncorresponds to the party color to which that elector belongs, then\r\ntearing off the voting number, which appears on the end of the ballot,\r\nafter comparing it with the voting number written on that elector's\r\naffidavit of registration, and then finally depositing the ballot into a\r\ngeneral ballot box, into which all the ballots of each political party\r\nare deposited. It will thus appear that every ballot has been checked in\r\nthree ways to identify it as being the original ballot sent to that\r\nelector, and as the one cast personally by him: First, it was contained\r\nin an envelope bearing his original signature; it bore his own party\r\nvoting number, which was separate and distinct from every other party\r\nvoting number in that precinct, and was printed under the authority of\r\nlaw only upon one ballot, namely, the ballot he receives; and finally it\r\nwas upon the color of paper which only the political party with which\r\nthat elector was affiliated was allowed by law to use. Every other\r\npolitical party's ballots were printed upon different colored paper.\r\n\r\nThis makes it practically impossible for any ballot to be cast or\r\ncounted other than the one lawfully mailed and regularly received and\r\nvoted and mailed in person by the elector to whom it was sent.\r\n\r\nEven the most prejudiced opponents of the Postal Direct Primary bill\r\nadmit that there are no practical reasons why it would not operate very\r\nsuccessfully in the rural districts and the smaller cities and towns.\r\nSuch an admission is a very far-reaching argument for the bill as a\r\ngeneral working measure for direct nominations. It is an open confession\r\nthat the plan is workable and meritorious. The only objection that has\r\nbeen urged with any semblance of force is the argument that the ballot\r\ncould be easily corrupted in large cities, where the opportunities for\r\nfraud are great, and where the intelligence and honesty of certain\r\nclasses of voters is low. It is suggested with considerable merit that\r\namong the foreign and ignorant classes in the great centers of\r\npopulation, corruption of suffrage is a matter easily accomplished; that\r\nthere would be many of such voters willing to lend themselves to any\r\nscheme to deliver their primary ballots to certain persons to be voted\r\nas they desired under the names of the Individual electors.\r\n\r\nAt first blush, this argument appears to have some force, but upon close\r\nreading of the provisions of the bill, and its necessary effect upon the\r\nPractical operation of a primary campaign, it must be admitted that this\r\nsole objection is largely argumentative. In the first place, as pointed\r\nout above, each ballot must be cast by the person to whom it was sent,\r\nfor it is contained in an envelope bearing the elector's own known\r\nsignature. Therefore none other can vote the ballot. In the second\r\nplace, the bill provides for extreme penal penalties for any one\r\ntampering with ballots, assisting a voter in the marking of a ballot\r\n(other than incapable voters), standing about and watching an elector\r\nmark his ballot, or in any wise influencing, or observing a voter in the\r\nmarking of his ballot at the time it is voted, sealed in the envelope\r\nand dropped in the postoffice. All the penalties are for imprisonment\r\nand not for fines. This, then, will force any plan to secure ballots or\r\ncorrupt the same to be done secretly and illegally. It must appear that\r\nthere can be no extensive system of vote corruption carried on without\r\ndiscovery. It must further appear that there would be extremely few who\r\nwould care to general or direct any extensive plan of corrupting or\r\ninfluencing primary ballots. It would be too risky a proceeding. If then\r\nvotes were corrupted, it would have to be done very secretly and amongst\r\nonly a trusted few. Therefore the percentage influenced in this manner\r\ncould not be large.\r\n\r\nAnother bar to any tampering with ballots would be the check which each\r\npolitical party and each candidate would have upon the other. It would\r\nbe a matter of political capital for one party to detect leaders or\r\norganizations within another party tampering with or corrupting the vote\r\nat its primary election. The various candidates for the different\r\noffices within the same party would watch one another with extreme\r\nvigilance to detect any attempt to influence or corrupt the ballots\r\nagainst them.\r\n\r\nLastly, it is suggested that because of the fact that these primary\r\nelection ballots would be sent at the same time to thousands of\r\ndifferent places throughout the precinct and city, and would be opened\r\nin offices and in homes on the same day, and in all probability fully\r\n75% of them would be voted and remailed on the same day received; that\r\nit would be practically impossible to devise any system that would reach\r\nout and get these countless ballots in a thousand different places\r\nwithin a space of a few hours or a day. They would be too scattered to\r\nbe gotten hold of or traced with any degree of success.\r\n\r\nIt must appear from a broad-minded consideration of the practical\r\nworkings of this Postal Direct Primary law that there is no valid reason\r\nwhy it would not work with splendid success even in the congested and\r\nilliterate districts of our larger cities. But even admitting for the\r\nsake of argument that a certain percentage of the ignorant and vicious\r\nvote could be corrupted by the bosses, it certainly could not be large.\r\nIt could not possibly exceed ten per cent of the registered vote. In\r\nlight of the fact that this system would bring out at least twenty-five\r\nper cent more votes than any other primary law has ever succeeded in\r\nbringing out, it is seen at a glance that the corrupted vote would be\r\nfar outweighed and overbalanced by the much larger percentage of decent\r\nvote that would be secured for the first time by means of this postal\r\nsystem of voting. The argument, then, is unanswerable in favor of this\r\nPostal Direct Primary law.\r\n\r\nAnd it would for the first time give the intelligent and honest elements\r\nin all political parties the direct control of the power of nomination\r\nfor public offices. Moreover, the mere fact that it would cause a larger\r\nnumber of people to vote would be of inestimable value, for it would\r\ntend to rouse and awaken public interest in civic affairs and by thus\r\ndoing would educate and train the minds of the better classes in\r\nelection affairs, and could not help but raise the honesty and power of\r\npopular suffrage. In other words, it would accomplish in the fullest\r\ndegree, the results sought to be obtained by every direct primary law,\r\nnamely, a popular choice of candidates for public office, with the power\r\nof selection for once actually in the hands of the honest electors.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it might be well to mention that this system of voting by\r\nmail would protect the suffrage of many of our best citizens, who, under\r\npresent laws, are practically disfranchised. Such men are travelers, the\r\nsick, sailors, trainmen, and other men who, by reason of their\r\noccupation or misfortune, are forced to be absent from the place of\r\ntheir voting precincts on election day, but who could and would vote if\r\nan opportunity was extended to them to vote by mail. This would\r\nconstitute no small class of voters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Montgomery's Report.\r\n\r\n55 Dr. Montgomery's report to the Senate was as follows:\r\n\r\nPalo Alto, Cal., March 22, 1909.\r\n\r\nLieutenant-Governor Warren R. Porter,\r\n\r\nPresident State Senate, Sacramento, Cal.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of March 21, 1909, about 4:30 p. m., J. L. Martin,\r\nSergeant-at-Arms of the Senate of the State of California, called on me\r\nand informed me that I had been designated by the President of the\r\nSenate to proceed with him to Palo Alto, and to consult with the\r\nphysicians of Senator Marshall Black, to ascertain if Senator Black's\r\nhealth was such as to permit him to go to Sacramento. I arrived at the\r\noffice of Dr. Howard Black, Senator Black's physician, at about 9:30 p.\r\nm., March 21, 1909, and there met Dr. Howard Black, Dr. H. B. Reynolds,\r\nDr. J. C. Spencer and Dr. R. L. Wilbur. These physicians said they had\r\nheld a consultation and had made an examination of Senator Marshall\r\nBlack that afternoon; according to their statement, Senator Marshall\r\nBlack had arrived in Palo Alto about five days previously suffering from\r\ninflammation of the eyes, commonly called \"pink eye,\" and that this\r\ninflammation of the eyes had almost entirely cleared up, but that the\r\ninflammation traveled down the throat and bronchial tubes. According to\r\ntheir statement to me on the evening of March 21, 1909, Senator Marshall\r\nBlack was suffering from broncho-pneumonia, and symptoms of inflammation\r\nin the lower lobe of the left lung, the temperature that afternoon was\r\nninety-nine and the pulse ninety. The heart was in good condition. The\r\ncough was severe and the expectoration abundant. I stated to these\r\nphysicians that I was delegated by the Senate of the State of California\r\nto make a thorough and complete examination of Senator Black for the\r\npurpose of ascertaining at what time it would be safe for Senator Black\r\nto proceed to Sacramento. I was informed by Dr. Howard Black that\r\nSenator Marshall Black would not permit me to see him. I then asked\r\nSenator Black's physicians, individually and collectively, if in their\r\nopinion, in Senator Black's present physical condition any serious\r\ninconvenience or injury would accrue to Senator Black from a personal\r\nexamination by me. They all stated that, on their part, they were\r\nperfectly willing that such examination should be held by the Senate\r\nphysician, and that such an examination in their opinion could do no\r\ninjury. I asked if the patient was in sound and disposing mind. I was\r\nanswered he was. At about 10 a. m., March 22, 1909, I again called on\r\nDr. Howard Black, renewing my request of the previous evening\r\nto see Senator Marshall Black. Senator Black, through the physician,\r\nstill declined to receive me. I then asked Dr. Howard Black when, in his\r\nopinion, Senator Marshall Black would be in condition to proceed to\r\nSacramento. He said that at the consultation of the previous day it was\r\nconcluded that it would be a week before Senator Black would be in such\r\na condition as to enable him with safety to undertake the Journey. As\r\nthis consultation was held on March 21st, it would, in their opinion, be\r\nMarch 28th before Senator Black would be in a condition to proceed to\r\nSacramento. I asked if, in his opinion, Senator Black was convalescing.\r\nHe said that in his opinion he was. He said that Senator Black's\r\ntemperature this morning was 100, his pulse 90, his cough still severe,\r\nand there still was evidence of inflammation in the lower lobe of the\r\nleft lung. Personally, from what I know of Senator Black's physicians, I\r\nbelieve these facts to be true. Taking it for granted that these facts\r\nare true, I do not find that, from them alone, I can conclude that\r\nSenator Black is unable to proceed to Sacramento. In order to concur in\r\nthis opinion of Senator Black's physicians I would have to see the\r\npatient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDouglass W. Montgomery, M. D.\r\n\r\nDelegated by Lieutenant-Governor Warren R. Porter to examine into the\r\nstate of health of Senator Marshall Black.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Anti-Japanese Bill's Resolution.\r\n\r\n94 The resolution was in full as follows:\r\n\r\nWhereas, Assembly Bill, No. 14, introduced by Mr. Johnson of Sacramento,\r\nand reading as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Act\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Amend Section 1662 of the Political Code\r\n\r\nThe people of the State of California, represented in Senate and\r\nAssembly, do enact as follows:\r\n\r\nSection 1. Section 1662 of the Political Code is hereby amended so as to\r\nread as follows:\r\n\r\n1662. Every school, unless otherwise provided by law, must be open for\r\nthe admission of all children between six and twenty-one years of age\r\nresiding in the district and the board of school trustees, or city board\r\nof education, have power to admit adults and children not residing in\r\nthe district, whenever good reasons exist therefor. Trustees shall have\r\nthe power to exclude children of filthy or vicious habits, or children\r\nsuffering from contagious or infectious diseases, and also to establish\r\nseparate schools for Indian children and for the children of Mongolian,\r\nor Japanese, or Chinese descent. When such separate schools are\r\nestablished, Indian, Chinese, Japanese or Mongolian children must not be\r\nadmitted into any other school; provided, that in cities and towns in\r\nwhich the kindergarten has been adopted or may hereafter be adopted as\r\npart of the public primary schools, children may be admitted to such\r\nkindergarten classes at the age of four years; and provided further,\r\nthat in cities or school districts in which separate classes have been\r\nor may hereafter be established, for the instruction of the deaf,\r\nchildren may be admitted to such classes at the age of three years.\r\n\r\nIs now pending before this Assembly; and\r\n\r\nWhereas, It has been represented by the President of the United States\r\nthat the passage of this bill will, in some manner undisclosed, disturb\r\nthe relations now existing between the government of the United States\r\nand the government of Japan; and\r\n\r\nWhereas, The President of the United States has made known to this\r\nAssembly, through the Governor of this State and through the Speaker of\r\nthis Assembly, his wish that said bill be not passed; and\r\n\r\nWhereas, The President of the United States has caused it to be\r\nrepresented to this body that it is his judgment that said bill would\r\nconflict with the treaty now existing between the government of the\r\nUnited States and the government of Japan, and because of such conflict\r\nthe passage of such bill would be beyond the power of the Legislature of\r\nthis State, and\r\n\r\nWhereas, The Governor of this State and the Speaker of this Assembly\r\nhave conveyed to this body their desire that this bill be not passed;\r\nand\r\n\r\nWhereas, It is the desire of this body to accede to the wishes of the\r\nChief Executive of this State, and the Speaker of this Assembly;\r\ntherefore be it\r\n\r\nResolved, That it is fitting and proper that a statement of the position\r\nof this Assembly upon this question be made, to the end that a mistaken\r\nimpression do not result from the failure of the Assembly to pass this\r\nbill; be it further\r\n\r\nResolved, That such position is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The school system of the State of California is an institution of the\r\nState alone, maintained, supported, conducted and controlled wholly\r\nunder and in accordance with the powers reserved to the State.\r\n\r\n2. That the power to maintain, conduct and control the State school\r\nsystem has not been granted to the Federal Government.\r\n\r\n3. That the Legislature of California may properly pass any law relative\r\nto the school system of this State that in its judgment may seem best.\r\n\r\n4. That by said Assembly Bill No. 14 it is not designed to deprive\r\nchildren of Indian, Mongolian, Chinese, or Japanese descent of equal\r\nschool privileges and opportunities, but, on the contrary, to these\r\nthere shall be given, and for these there shall be provided the same\r\nprivileges and opportunities as are given to and provided for all other\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n5. That Assembly Bill No. 14 contemplates the establishment and\r\nmaintenance of separate schools for different races, but all schools so\r\nestablished and maintained shall afford equal and the same facilities\r\nfor instruction.\r\n\r\n6. That this Assembly recognize it to be a duty resting upon the State\r\nto furnish to children of Indian, Mongolian, Chinese, or Japanese\r\ndescent the same facilities and opportunities as are furnished to\r\nchildren of other races and affirm that no more can be required and that\r\nnothing different is contemplated by said Act. That said Act gives to\r\nchildren of Indian, Mongolian, Chinese, or Japanese descent who are\r\nsubjects of other countries the same rights and privileges as are given\r\nto native born citizens of California, and no power has the right to\r\ndemand more. That this Assembly is disposed to accede to the wishes of\r\nthe Federal Government as conveyed to us by the Governor of this State\r\nand the Speaker of this Assembly, but while doing so we reaffirm and\r\nreassert that the subject matter of Assembly Bill No. 14 is purely and\r\nexclusively a matter of State concern, falling within the reserve powers\r\nof the State, and violates no provision of the Federal Constitution.\r\n\r\n7. That it is the judgment of this Assembly that said bill does not\r\nconflict with the treaty existing between the government of the United\r\nStates and the government of Japan, and that we recognize the authority\r\nto make treaties is by the Federal Constitution, vested in the President\r\nand Senate of the United States, we affirm that the right to administer\r\nour State school system can not be controlled by treaty made by the\r\nPresident and the Senate of the United States, nor by action of the\r\nPresident alone.\r\n\r\n8. And finally, while we recognize that Assembly Bill No. 14\r\nis drawn and could be passed by the Legislature of this State in full\r\nconformity with the powers reserved to the State and vouchsafed to it by\r\nthe Federal Constitution, we are unwilling to do aught which may disturb\r\nthe relations existing between this government and a friendly power, and\r\nfor this reason alone, we recommend that Assembly Bill No. 14 be\r\nreconsidered and withdrawn.",
