This\r\nproduction should have been left to the oblivion which inevitably\r\nawaits it, nor should my pen have been employed in its detection and\r\nexposure, had it not been characterized by the lowest attempts at\r\nconcealment and treachery, falsehood and detraction.--Like _Iago_ in\r\nthe play, a wretched abandonment of character, a destitution of\r\nprinciple, and a fiend-like thirst for _revenge_, accompany the author\r\nthro' the whole of his progress, and appear to acquire additional\r\nforce, as he approaches the period of his downfall. That it is a\r\ntissue, however, which it requires no strength to burst, will appear by\r\nthe examination of a single point on which the whole of the story is\r\nmade to rest. If the ridiculous charge made against two or three\r\nindividuals that they had cheated Mr. Young out of his nomination,\r\nturns out to be the mere phantom of a disordered imagination, instead\r\nof a logical deduction of truth, if the facts which have been urged in\r\nsupport of this charge, are the mere creatures of misrepresentation,\r\nprevarication and falsehood; this alone will settle the controversy,\r\nand fix the imputation, upon its unprincipled authors. The loop on\r\nwhich this absurd tale is made to hang, is the _frail and feeble_\r\ncertificate of Ketcham, Gardner and Cowles. That I should be authorised\r\nto apply an epithet more severe than that of frail and feeble, I take\r\nit upon me to prove in the first place by the certificate itself,\r\ncompared with one which the same men issued last spring: And in the\r\nnext place by a plain statement of facts, given under the solemnity of\r\nan oath, leaving it at present for _atheists_ and blasphemers, (for I\r\nam sure none others will) to ascribe greater moral certainty to a\r\ncertificate carrying on the face of it miserable evasion, than to a\r\nhistory sanctioned by an appeal to the Christians God.\r\n\r\nThat this certificate is both suspicious and evasive, I appeal to the\r\npamphlet page 27. Why do they not tell their fellow-citizens, that\r\n_they did not collectively or individually during that session charge\r\nYoung with ill-treatment towards them_? Would not this have been\r\nperfectly easy if true? Why do they blink the question, and tell a long\r\nstory about a conversation which they held with Mr. Bunce, which\r\nwhether it was true or untrue, is totally immaterial? What do they mean\r\nin a later stage of their certificate, by the _unsuspecting and_\r\n_unguarded conversation_, they had held with Mr. Bunce, and which they\r\nwere afraid he would make mischief of? Do they call the conversation\r\nwhich they detail an unguarded one? Or was it some other conversation\r\nand conversations which shall be proved upon them? Instead of saying\r\nthat they expressed no opinion to Bunce that \"Young ought not _again_\r\nto be nominated,\" why do they not tell us, whether they or either of\r\nthem expressed any opinion to Bunce, or any other person, against his\r\nnomination _the then next spring_? In Mr. Kasson's letter (p. 33) it\r\nappears they told him that \"_Bunce and another gentleman_\" called on\r\nthem, with whom they held a conversation; whereas the one given in\r\ntheir recent certificate is confined exclusively to Bunce. Read also\r\nthe following certificate of these men, which they gave to the public\r\nlast spring; in which they admit some other conversation which they\r\ncall _a free and unreserved conversation_, and protest against the\r\n\"treacherous perversion\" of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_To the Citizens of the county of Saratoga_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Having heard that a private conversation of ours has been represented\r\nto our Fellow Citizens in a light unfavorable to the character of\r\nSamuel Young, Esq. and has been used to his prejudice, in the\r\nestimation of his constituents.--We discharge a duty grateful to our\r\nindividual feelings, due to the feelings and character of a highly\r\nuseful, able, faithful and industrious Member of Assembly, and due to\r\nour county, to express our _pointed indignation_ against the\r\n_treacherous perversion_ of the spirit of a free and unreserved\r\nconversation by stating to our fellow citizens, that we have always\r\nlived in the most perfect harmony with Mr. Young, have had with him on\r\nall legislative business the most cordial co-operation and concert:\r\nthat his uniform deportment towards us has been friendly and decorous,\r\nand that we never gave an intimation of any wish or opinion against his\r\nrenomination to the Assembly.--HOWEL GARDNER, RICHARD KETCHUM, BENJAMIN\r\nCOWLES. _Albany, April 17, 1815_.\"[1]\r\n\r\nWhatever name these gentlemen, may have given to their conversations,\r\nsome times calling them _unsuspecting and unguarded_, and sometimes\r\n_free and unreserved_, in order to determine their nature and place\r\nthem in a clear light, I shall now go on to shew the public what they\r\ndid say, and not stop to quarrel about names so long as I am sure that\r\npublic will be content with the things themselves. I challenge\r\nincredulity itself after reading the following affidavits and\r\nstatements, to doubt one moment on the subject.\r\n\r\n     \"Isaiah Bunce & Thomas Palmer being duly sworn, say, that\r\n     they were at Albany in the early part of the late session of\r\n     the Legislature, and put up at the house where the Delegates\r\n     of the county of Saratoga quartered. That they and three of\r\n     the Delegates from said county, viz. Messrs. Ketcham, Gardner\r\n     and Cowles, conversed freely with each other on various\r\n     political subjects, and in one conversation they had with\r\n     these said Members, they told these Deponents, that they had\r\n     not been well treated by their colleague Mr. Young--spoke\r\n     freely of their unpleasant situation, owing to that\r\n     treatment, mentioning a number of instances illustrating the\r\n     same, both in the fall session and the then session of the\r\n     Legislature.\r\n\r\n     \"And these deponents further say, that they the said Ketcham,\r\n     Gardner and Cowles, did in that conversation, decidedly\r\n     express their opinion that the said Young ought not to\r\n     represent this county again in the next session--at the same\r\n     time signifying that they had no wish, that the talents of\r\n     Mr. Young should be lost to the county, but believed it would\r\n     be for his benefit, should he not be elected the ensuing\r\n     session--or language to that import.\r\n\r\n     \"And these deponents further say, that this conversation took\r\n     place while it was generally believed and expected, and so\r\n     expressed by the said Ketcham, Cowles and Gardner in\r\n     particular, that Mr. Young would in a day or two, be\r\n     appointed Secretary of the State of New-York.--ISAIAH BUNCE,\r\n     THOMAS PALMER. _Sworn the 5th day of May, in the Year 1815,\r\n     before me SAMUEL COOK, Master in Chancery_.\"\r\n\r\n     \"John Dunning being sworn saith, That in March last, He went\r\n     to Albany and there saw Benjamin Cowles Esq. one of the\r\n     Delegates from Saratoga, who told this deponent, that Samuel\r\n     Young Esq. had treated the Members of this county with\r\n     neglect, that their situation owing to the treatment they had\r\n     received from him was very disagreeable, or words to that\r\n     amount--mentioning instances of that neglect &c.\r\n\r\n     \"And this deponent further saith, That on his return from\r\n     Albany, he overtook Richard Ketchum Esq. then going to visit\r\n     his family in Stillwater--that he conversed with the said\r\n     Ketchum, on the subject of Mr. Young's treatment to them, who\r\n     informed this deponent the same as Mr. Cowles had done, and\r\n     related several circumstances confirming the same.--JOHN\r\n     DUNNING.

BEEBE, _Justice of the\r\n     Peace_.\r\n\r\n     \"Amos Allcott being sworn saith, that Messrs. Ketchum,\r\n     Gardner and Cowles, three of the Delegates from the county of\r\n     Saratoga, some time in March last, when at Albany, told this\r\n     Deponent, that they had been ill-treated, or not well treated\r\n     by Samuel Young Esq. their colleague--and expressed their\r\n     opinion and wishes fully, that some other person than he,\r\n     should the next session represent this county in Assembly.\r\n     Mr. Ketchum in presence of the other two, said he had made up\r\n     his mind fully in favor of George Palmer, Esq. or Esek Cowen\r\n     Esq. being the man, to which the other two appeared to\r\n     assent.--Mr. Gardner however remarked, that _some said_ Mr.\r\n     Young might be sufficiently, mortified by not being appointed\r\n     Secretary of State.--AMOS ALLCOTT. _Sworn the 5th day of May,\r\n     in the Year 1815, before me SAMUEL COOK Master in Chancery_.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Lewis B. Edwards being sworn saith, That a few days after\r\n     Mr. Bunce and Palmer returned from Albany--Mr. Gardner Member\r\n     of Assembly, called at the office of the _Saratoga Journal_,\r\n     on his way home to see his family, and told Mr. Bunce among\r\n     other things, that Mr. Young had lost the Office of Secretary\r\n     of State, and that Mr. Porter was appointed. And further\r\n     remarked, 'it may be best to suspend the thing we talked of,\r\n     his loosing that may humble him enough, pride will have a\r\n     all'--or words to that import.\r\n\r\n     \"And this Deponent further saith, That about a fortnight\r\n     after this, Mr. Cowles one of the other Members of Assembly,\r\n     called at the Office on his return from Hadley to the\r\n     Legislature, and on Mr. Bunce, asking him whether Mr. Young\r\n     had treated them any better since his disappointment, he\r\n     replied he had not--and that Mr. Young had never yet even\r\n     asked them to walk to the House with him or words to that\r\n     effect. On the said Bunces enquiry whether he had mentioned\r\n     the subject to any of his friends while at home--he replied\r\n     that he intended to have done so to Esq. Rockwell, but he had\r\n     missed of him returning from Albany. Mr. Rockwell, as\r\n     appeared having gone to Albany while Mr. Cowles was going to\r\n     Hadley.--LEWIS B. EDWARDS. _Sworn the fifth day of May, in\r\n     the year 1815, before me SAMUEL COOK, Master in Chancery_.\"\r\n\r\nIt is here proper to remark, that on the 18th of April, the day of the\r\nMcBain meeting; Judge Child, recommended that no publication he made on\r\neither side, and that after election a meeting should take place\r\nbetween the members and Messrs. Bunce and Palmer, and endeavor to come\r\nto an amicable explanation. Mr. Stillwell, will well remember, that two\r\ndays afterwards he called on Mr. Palmer, with a message from Judge\r\nChild, requesting him, \"by all means not to publish any thing during\r\nthe election, relative to the conversation with the members,\" to which\r\nMr. Palmer readily assented. Notwithstanding which, the next day the\r\ncertificate of the members, were brought to the Federal Printing\r\nOffice, and several hundred copies struck off, with the knowledge of\r\nMr. Stillwell, who then kept his office within a few rods of the\r\nFederal Press. Yet no contrary statements were published during the\r\nelection, nor until after two or three weeks had expired after the time\r\nset by Mr. Cowles, for the members to meet Messrs. Bunce and Palmer.\r\nThe members were requested by several Republicans to meet; they were\r\nfinally publicly invited in the Journal, but contrary to the\r\nexpectations and wishes of a great portion of the Republicans of the\r\nCounty, they did not come forward; and the above affidavits were\r\npublished. And here the controversy on this point might have ended; but\r\nit seems the members, or rather the 'Citizen,' was not satisfied, and\r\nhe procures _another_ certificate from them, which may be seen in page\r\n27 28 and 29 of that pamphlet. Compare their _two_ statements--examine\r\nthe above affidavits again--read the following certificates, and judge\r\nfor yourselves.\r\n\r\n     \"I hereby certify, that I met Benjamin Cowles, Esq. at Jones'\r\n     Inn in Halfmoon, _on his return home from the Legislature_,\r\n     on the 20th of April last, two days after the McBain meeting,\r\n     and we there conversed together on the subject of the\r\n     conversation he Messrs. Ketchum and Gardner, had with Messrs.\r\n     Bunce and Palmer, in Albany, (where it was alleged that they\r\n     Ketchum, Cowles and Gardner, had complained of vanity,\r\n     neglect and ill-treatment of Mr. Young.) That I expressed my\r\n     surplice to Mr. Cowles, that he, (Cowles) Ketchum and Gardner\r\n     should lend their names to an instrument denying the\r\n     conversation above alluded to, when he Cowles, Ketchum and\r\n     Gardner, knew they had not only complained to Bunce and\r\n     Palmer, but to myself and others. To which he answered, that\r\n     the certificate given by them was not given meaning to deny\r\n     any thing that had been said as respected ill-treatment, &c.\r\n     of Mr. Young, but only to re-but other things which the\r\n     gentlemen who called for the certificate, (among whom were\r\n     James Thompson, Esq.) represented to have been said. On which\r\n     I suggested the propriety of his calling on Bunce and Palmer,\r\n     at the Springs; and immediately getting his colleagues to\r\n     meet them, and have the thing explained, and prevent improper\r\n     use being made of their certificate; to which preposition he,\r\n     after expressing his regret that it had become public,\r\n     cordially acceded. I then parted with him on my way to\r\n     New-York.--AMOS ALLCOTT, _Ballston Spa, March 1816_.\"\r\n\r\n     \"I certify, that Mr. Cowles did on that day, (20th April)\r\n     call on Mr. Bunce as mentioned in the above certificate of\r\n     Mr. Allcott he had agreed to do, and after some conversation\r\n     on the subject, in which he admitted that he, Gardner and\r\n     Ketchum, had complained of Young's ill treatment and\r\n     haughtiness to them, and their expressing their opinion\r\n     against his being nominated as a candidate for that election\r\n     &c. he strongly solicited Mr. Bunce to have nothing published\r\n     in his paper on the subject, till he could go and see his\r\n     colleagues, Mr. Gardner and Ketchum, and get them to meet and\r\n     have the affair explained and reconciled, which he said he\r\n     would at all events endeavor to do before the next paper\r\n     should come out, [this being _Thursday_, and the paper not to\r\n     appear before the next _Wednesday_,] that he was then in a\r\n     great hurry, and must get home that night, but he would make\r\n     it his business to immediately attend to it; to which\r\n     proposition Mr. Bunce readily agreed, and promised Mr. Cowles\r\n     accordingly. This conversation was in the office of the\r\n     Saratoga Journal, in the room in which I was at work. The\r\n     next day however, information was brought to Mr. Bunce in the\r\n     office, that the certificate of the said Cowles, Gardner and\r\n     Ketchum, denying the conversation relative to Mr. Young, was\r\n     then striking off at Mr. Comstock's Office in this place, and\r\n     shortly after a _printed copy_ was brought into the office.--\r\n     LEWIS B. EDWARDS. _Ballston Spa, March 1816_.\"\r\n\r\n     \"I certify, that shortly after the rising of the Legislature,\r\n     I saw Benjamin Cowles, Esq. in the village of Ballston Spa,\r\n     on his way home; And in a conversation with him relative to\r\n     the reports respecting Mr. Young, I asked him whether he had\r\n     not told Mr. Bunce and Palmer, 'that Mr. Young had treated\r\n     his colleagues with neglect, and that his treatment towards\r\n     them was haughty and reserved,' to which Mr. Cowles answered\r\n     in the affirmative. I further asked him if he did not tell\r\n     Mr. Palmer and Bunce, 'that he was convinced of Mr. Young's\r\n     vanity, previous to his being in the Legislature with him,'\r\n     and state as an example 'that while they were Supervisors,\r\n     they were appointed a committee to arrange or make out an\r\n     account, for the board of Supervisors, and that he the said\r\n     Benjamin Cowles, Esq. made out the account himself and\r\n     delivered it to Mr. Y. who copied and presented it to the\r\n     board of Supervisors, and claimed the credit of it himself.'\r\n     To all of which Mr. Cowles answered in the affirmative, and\r\n     expressed a wish that Mr. B. and P. would not publish any\r\n     thing concerning the conversation, as he was anxious to see\r\n     Messrs. Gardner and Ketchum, and have the affair reconciled.\r\n     He further stated that he did not think that the certificate\r\n     given by Mr. Ketchum, Gardner and himself, to Jas. Thompson;\r\n     Esq. did deny the conversation with Bunce and Palmer.--A.W.\r\n     ODELL. _Ballston Spa, March, 1816_.\"\r\n\r\n     \"I certify that some time in the month of February 1815,\r\n     Benjamin Cowles, Esq. came home from the Legislature on a\r\n     visit, that I saw Mr. Cowles at Ensign's Inn, in the town of\r\n     Hadley, in which town we both reside; and that we then and\r\n     there entered into a conversation concerning Mr. Young, and\r\n     that Mr. Cowles intimated to me that Mr. Young's treatment\r\n     was haughty towards the members, and said that he was\r\n     disappointed in his expectations in the treatment he received\r\n     from Mr. Young, and he further told me that he thought it\r\n     would be as well to send some _other_ man to the Legislature\r\n     the then ensuing year.\r\n\r\n     \"I further certify, that some time in the fall of 1815, I had\r\n     another conversation with the said Benjamin Cowles, Esq. on\r\n     the subject of the affidavits that had been published,\r\n     relative to the conversation said to have passed between\r\n     Isaiah Bunce and Thomas Palmer, and the members in Albany;\r\n     and that during that conversation he did not contradict the\r\n     statements published, but gave me to understand that the same\r\n     were true, and intimated that he had inconsiderately signed\r\n     the certificate published during the election.\r\n\r\n     \"I further certify, that Mr. Cowles was the first person, who\r\n     informed me of the ill-treatment the members had received\r\n     from Mr. Young, and that it would be as well to send some\r\n     other person to the Legislature the ensuing year.--BARRY\r\n     FENTON. _Hadley, March 1816_.\"\r\n\r\n     \"I, Jacob Thorn, of Galway, in the county of Saratoga; do\r\n     certify, that shortly after the affidavits of Messrs. Bunce,\r\n     Palmer, Allcott, Dunning and Edwards, were published,\r\n     relative to the conversation they had with Messrs. Ketcham,\r\n     Gardner and Cowles in Albany; I had a conversation with Mr.\r\n     Ketcham in Stillwater, relative to the affidavits published.\r\n     I told him if the affidavits were not true, he ought to\r\n     contradict them. He replied, that his _friends advised him to\r\n     say nothing about it_. I enquired of him the meaning of those\r\n     affidavits---and whether the facts therein stated were\r\n     true--to which the said Ketcham answered, that _they were\r\n     true_--but said he did not expect it would have been made\r\n     public.--JACOB THORN.\"\r\n\r\n     \"I certify, that some time in the month of March 1815, I went\r\n     to Albany on business, and called at the house where the\r\n     members of this county resided; found Messrs.

Accordingly he\r\n     did; told me it was not according to his wish, that what I\r\n     had to offer in the business could not be complied with. I\r\n     then asked where Mr. Young quartered? He said he would tell\r\n     me; on the way, Mr. Cowles said there had been _a coldness\r\n     between the Speaker of the House, and the members from this\r\n     County, since he became speaker and expected to be Secretary\r\n     of State_, and on that account _declined going_.--JONATHAN\r\n     KELLOGG. _Northumberland, April 8th 1816_.\"\r\n\r\n     \"I hereby solemnly certify, that some time in the month of\r\n     February, 1815, (and I believe in the early part of it,) in a\r\n     conversation Col. John Prior had with me just after his\r\n     return from Albany, on the subject of candidates for the then\r\n     approaching election; he the said Prior remarked, that 'Mr.\r\n     Young was not so popular as he had been.' On my asking him\r\n     why, he replied, 'for his ill treatment to his colleagues,\r\n     having grown haughty, &c.' This I understood him to have\r\n     received directly from the said members, Messrs. Gardner,\r\n     Cowles and Ketcham. In the spring of the same year, after\r\n     Messrs. Palmer and Bunce had made known similar complaints,\r\n     that the said three members had made to them of Young's\r\n     treatment, I had another conversation with the said Prior on\r\n     the subject, in which he the said Prior intimated, 'he did\r\n     not believe the said members had told the said Palmer and\r\n     Bunce what they had pretended.' I then asked him, if the\r\n     members were not as likely to tell them of it, as himself,\r\n     and repeated to the said Prior what he had told me in the\r\n     winter, of the members having made the same complaint to him,\r\n     which the said Prior did not pretend to deny as having heard\r\n     from the members, nor having told me the same.--JOSEPH\r\n     MITCHEL. _Dated, Greenfield, March 15, 1815_.\"\r\n\r\n     \"I hereby certify, that in the early part of the winter past,\r\n     I had a conversation with Isaac Myers of Stillwater, relative\r\n     to the conduct of Richard Ketcham, late a member of the\r\n     Legislature; when he the said Myers told me that _he knew_\r\n     the said Ketcham had _contradicted himself_, relative to what\r\n     he had said of Mr. Young; that _previous_ to the McBain\r\n     meeting, Ketcham had _denied_ to him, ever saying any thing\r\n     _against_ Young, or complaining of his treatment; but that\r\n     _afterwards_ he had _owned to several in his presence, that\r\n     he had spoken against_ Young, &c.--ASA B. JEWEL. _Saratoga,\r\n     March 25th 1816_.\"\r\n\r\nOther affidavits and statements might be produced to the same effect\r\nbut twelve or fourteen different conversations, at different times,\r\nand, in presence of different men are already proved upon them, all\r\nimporting explicitly that Mr. Young had ill-treated or neglected\r\nthem--and shewing a desire on their part that Mr. Young should not be\r\nsent to the Legislature the ensuing year. If then Mr. Young had an\r\nundoubted right to a seat in the legislature, which would perhaps be\r\nquestionable upon republican ground, and was deprived of that right by\r\n\"management and fraud,\" with whom did this system of corruption\r\ncommence! and to whose account ought it to be placed? To that of his\r\ncolleagues, or other men whom their misstatements and falsehoods had\r\nseduced? It may however, be very well to enquire whether these\r\ndeclarations were ever made use of to any purpose, and whether Mr.\r\nYoung must have succeeded in his nomination, had these _free_ and\r\n_unreserved_ conversations of his colleagues, been kept entirely out of\r\nview; whether Palmer and Bunce, were alone in singling out the\r\ncandidate who was nominated, or whether some other person or persons\r\nhad not tho't of him even _before_ Palmer and Bunce went to Albany.\r\n\r\nAmong the names which ornament the pages of \"_The Citizen_,\" I observe\r\nthat of a _recent_ convert to the doctrine of \"_Falsehood, Fraud & Co_\"\r\nviz: William Stillwell, late a Judge, and now Clerk of this county.\r\nThis political _Proteus_, together with a number of his, friends was I\r\nbelieve, among the first to start Mr. Cowen as a candidate, before the\r\ncounty convention, and was from time to time very importunate with him,\r\nto consent that his name should be made use of for this purpose. From\r\nthe early part of February 1815, until he had got the Clerk's office,\r\nbe appears to have been Mr. Cowen's indefatigable supporter. At the\r\nMcBain meeting however, he was as active and diligent to get rid of\r\nthat nomination, as he had before been to effect it. Thomas Palmer,\r\nEsq. the secretary of that meeting, together with. Judge Stillwell,\r\nwere chosen two of the committee to draw up the proceedings, and were\r\nunquestionably in all respects the proper organ for that purpose.\r\nSensible of this, Judge Stillwell, the evening after the meeting,\r\n_invited Mr. Palmer to his house_, where _they_ deliberately, and\r\nwithout any _disagreement_ drew up the statement, published p. 24 and\r\n25, of their pamphlet. They _jointly reviewed_ this statement the _next\r\nmorning--agreed_ in its correctness, and ordered it to be printed.\r\nShortly after, without the knowledge of Mr. Palmer or Mr. Cowen,\r\nStillwell _secretly withdraws_ this statement from the printing office,\r\nand adopts and signs _another_ drawn up by Mr. Thompson, _differing in\r\nmany respects from the first_. This last statement the secretary\r\nrefused to sign, and his name was inserted as you will see by the\r\nstatement itself, p. 16, without his knowledge or authority. Having\r\nthus boxed the compass and settled down upon _point no point_, it is\r\nnot surprising that when Stillwell lends his name to \"_The Citizen_\"\r\nand appears in his Book, as the flaming advocate for \"fair and open\r\nconduct,\" and the zealous _detector_ of \"fraud and duplicity,\" that he\r\nshould hypocritically _skulk behind the scene_, and keep himself as\r\nmuch out of view as possible, in the strange and opposite parts which\r\nhe had acted. The singular course which this man (Stillwell) had\r\npursued both in and out of \"the book,\" and especially his attempt to\r\nshew that \"Mr. Cowen's nomination was procured by fraud, &c.\" drew the\r\nfollowing sentiments from Doctor Clark, (who was one of the convention\r\nwhich nominated Mr. Cowen) expressed in a letter to Thomas Palmer,\r\nEsq.--\r\n\r\n     \"_Moreau, March 12th 1816_.\r\n\r\n     Dear Sir,\r\n\r\n     Having seen and examined a publication signed \"A Citizen,\"\r\n     purporting to be an apology and justification of the\r\n     gentlemen who composed the McBain meeting. In that\r\n     publication I observe a studied and systematic attempt to fix\r\n     on you and Mr. Bunce, the blame of having started Esek Cowen\r\n     Esq. as a candidate for assembly, and of having procured his\r\n     nomination by _fraud_ and _intrigue_. In consequence of\r\n     seeing Wm. Stillwell's name affixed to the proceedings of\r\n     that meeting, and being well informed that the said Stillwell\r\n     hath gone great length to justify the conduct of the said\r\n     meeting, in making void the nomination made by the county\r\n     convention, I feel myself constrained by a sense of justice\r\n     to declare, that some time on or about the 11th day of\r\n     February 1815, being in company with Esek Cowen, at the house\r\n     of Wm. Stillwell Esq., he the said Stillwell did then and\r\n     there introduce the subject of the then next election, by\r\n     saying, that himself and a number of others had conversed on\r\n     the subject, and agreed that Mr. Cowen ought to be a\r\n     candidate--That Mr. Cowen made objections, and mentioned to\r\n     him the names of several other gentlemen as being proper\r\n     candidates in preference to himself; to which Mr. Stillwell\r\n     objected, and urged Mr. Cowen with apparent zeal to suffer\r\n     his name to be made use of as a candidate. Sir, you are at\r\n     liberty to make such use of the above statement of facts, as\r\n     in your judgment you shall think proper.\r\n\r\n     Yours, Respectfully, B.J. Clark.\r\n\r\n     Hon. T. Palmer Esq.\"\r\n\r\nIt will also appear _amongst other things_, by the following letter\r\nwritten by John R. Mott,[2] who I believe is the second certifier in\r\n\"the book,\" that Judge Stillwell entertained sentiments opposed to Mr.\r\nYoung's nomination, as late as the _sixth_ of _April_.\r\n\r\n     \"_Saratoga, April 6, 1815_.\r\n\r\n     Dear sir,\r\n\r\n     It was late when I returned from Ballston, which prevented my\r\n     calling on you I had conversations with _several gentlemen_\r\n     on the subject of the nomination, particularly with _Judge\r\n     Stillwell_, capt. Odell and Mr. Bunce, by whom I learned the\r\n     sentiments of Mr. Palmer, and find the whole to be opposed to\r\n     Mr. Young. I also saw Mr. Lee and Kasson. They were in favor\r\n     of Mr. Young on the principle of _what they called\r\n     sacrificing_ Mr. Young, if he was not nominated. The Milton\r\n     committee are Thomas Palmer, Joel Keeler and Daniel Couch,\r\n     junior Esquires.\r\n\r\n     From yours, with esteem,\r\n\r\n     Esek Cowen, Esq.\"\r\n\r\n     JOHN R. MOTT.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Mott, one of the delegation from Saratoga, informs Mr. Cowen\r\nanother of the delegation from that town, that Stillwell and others are\r\nopposed to Young. This presumption in Judge Stillwell, it seems could\r\nnot be endured, and he in common with others was marked out as a\r\nvictim. His name was originally connected with that of Palmer and\r\nBunce, in the letter of Kasson, dated the 12th April, p. 33, as being\r\nconcerned with them in \"this _black business_\" as he calls it, until by\r\nmaking his peace, this _crow_ is suddenly changed into a _swan_, and\r\nhis name erased from the letter.\r\n\r\nIf farther proof is wanting that the loss of Mr. Young's nomination did\r\nnot depend on any thing which fell from his colleagues, or any\r\nindividual exertion made against it, you may have it by calling on the\r\nfollowing gentlemen, who acted on the county convention, to wit:\r\n\r\n     Avery Starkweather, John Pettit, Eli Smith, Joel Keeler,\r\n     Isaac Rice, Nathan Raymond, Jessup Raymond, Richard Dunning,\r\n     James Clark, Isaac Andrus, Solomon Parks, Nicholas W. Angle,\r\n     Billy J. Clark, Potter Johnson, Benjamin Burton, Joseph\r\n     Mitchell, William Taylor, Samuel Cook, Nathan Pardee, Joshua\r\n     Finch, John Brown, Samuel S. Barker, Isaac Brewster, &c.\r\n\r\nYou will find among them many of the most respectable names in the\r\ncounty. By them it will also appear how far Mr. Young's failure\r\ndepended on Palmer and Bunce, and how far it was regulated by public\r\nsentiment. But, it is presumed that what Doctor Clark very properly\r\ncalls a _systematic attempt_, to fix a course of fraud upon two or\r\nthree individuals, and ascribe the result of that convention to them,\r\nmust appear as absurd and ridiculous in the eyes of the public, as it\r\ndid to Doctor Clark and his associates on the committee.\r\n\r\nBut why spend a moments time in refuting so base a calumny; by\r\nsearching for argument and demonstration while it must be rendered\r\nuseless by conviction. Another year has rolled away; another convention\r\nhave met--have made a nomination for Congress and Assembly--They were\r\nunanimous--Mr. Young is not nominated, nor even named for the year\r\n1816. This too was not till the blood-hounds of imaginary fraud had\r\nyelled their notes thro' the county, the quivers of malice had been\r\nexhausted of their poisoned arrows, and \"the book,\" that great gun of a\r\nfalling faction which they had been loading during the whole Summer\r\npast, had gone off with a harmless explosion.\r\n\r\nIt may not be amiss however, to examine the behaviour of these famous\r\npretenders to fair and open conduct, and see how far they practice what\r\nthey preach. In doing this, permit me to call your attention to the\r\nfollowing certificates.\r\n\r\n     \"I notice in the pamphlet signed 'A Citizen' lately\r\n     published, an assertion that the committee in the town of\r\n     _Milton_ in the Spring of 1815, 'was procured by management,\r\n     fraud and falsehood.' I attended the meeting in this town,\r\n     according to previous notice in the Journal for that purpose,\r\n     at which I saw Mr. T. Palmer and Mr. Bunce, but saw nothing\r\n     in them like either fraud or management. I voted in that\r\n     committee for Mess. Palmer, Keeler and Couch, but not from\r\n     any solicitations of either Mr. Bunce or Mr. Palmer, but\r\n     because I believed them the best men; nor had any one of\r\n     these, or any one else, then told me that the three members\r\n     had complained of Mr. Young.\r\n\r\n     \"James Thompson, Esq. was a candidate for the same committee,\r\n     and his partner, Alpheus Goodrich, Esq. wrote votes for the\r\n     said James Thompson; but I refused to vote for him, not,\r\n     however, from any thing I had ever heard either the said\r\n     Palmer or Bunce say against him. There was a large majority\r\n     for the three above named committee, but I saw no unusual\r\n     exertions, or any thing that looked like unfair proceedings,\r\n     in any one at the meeting who appeared to be voting the\r\n     ticket which I did.--EBENEZER DIBBLE. _Milton, March, 1816_.\"\r\n\r\n     \"I also was present at the above mentioned meeting for the\r\n     purpose of choosing delegates to the county convention. The\r\n     meeting was notified in the Journal, at Gregory & Hawkins',\r\n     on the day some of the town officers met there. The meeting\r\n     proceeded to organize by choosing Joel Keeler, Esq. chairman,\r\n     and Thomas Palmer secretary, and then without opposition,\r\n     voted to choose the committee by ballot. The candidates for\r\n     whom ballots were wrote, were, on one ticket, James Thompson,\r\n     Archy Kasson and Elias Benedict--On the other, Daniel Couch\r\n     jun, Joel Keeler and Thomas Palmer. Mr. Bunce was there; and\r\n     in the room, wrote votes for the latter three gentlemen, for\r\n     whom I voted, but not from the insinuations or persuasions of\r\n     any one. And I saw no intrigue, management or improper\r\n     electioneering in either the said Palmer or Bunce, or any one\r\n     else for that ticket; but believe every thing was conducted\r\n     fairly.\r\n\r\n     \"I had on that day, before I came there, heard of reports\r\n     against Mr. Young, but not from either Mr. Palmer or Mr.\r\n     Bunce; but to the best of my recollection from _Elihu Roe_ in\r\n     a conversation between him and _Deacon Stillwell_. I had\r\n     before heard no intimation of the same from any one.--EZRA\r\n     NASH. _Milton, March 1816_.\"\r\n\r\n     \"I was present at the republican meeting in Milton, in the\r\n     Spring of 1815, for the purpose of choosing a committee to\r\n     meet the general committee to make a nomination. I saw no\r\n     deception or intrigue on the part of either Mr. Palmer or Mr.\r\n     Bunce, nor any particular exertion of either of them to\r\n     procure the committee that were elected. Some time _before_\r\n     the said meeting, I had understood that James Thompson, Esq.\r\n     of said town, had _expressed a wish_ to be one of the\r\n     committee, and at the above mentioned meeting Alpheus\r\n     Goodrich, Esq. _his partner_ took a very active part to get\r\n     him appointed--wrote votes and endeavored to get others to\r\n     take them and vote for the said Thompson, his name being on\r\n     the same ticket with Archy Kasson and Elias Benedict; but\r\n     they received at the meeting, which consisted of about\r\n     thirty, but very few votes, the other ticket, which I voted,\r\n     obtaining a large majority. And I hereby further certify,\r\n     that neither the said Palmer nor Bunce, both being present at\r\n     the meeting, had ever informed me, or given me an intimation\r\n     that there was any complaint against Mr. Young, nor did I\r\n     ever hear of any complaints against Young, from any one until\r\n     some time afterwards; and from the best of my recollection,\r\n     _Joel Lee_ was the first who informed me of these complaints\r\n     against the said Young.--DAVID DERRICK. _Milton, March\r\n     1816_.\"\r\n\r\nIt appears that in the town of Milton Mr. Archy Kasson, Elias Benedict\r\nand James Thompson Esq. were candidates at the meeting in that town for\r\nthe choice of delegates in 1815.--That Alpheus Goodrich Esq. Thompson's\r\npartner, in particular, acted decidedly in favor of \"_Master Jimmy_\" as\r\nhe calls him, perhaps with a good deal of propriety, and peddled\r\ntickets with Mr. Kasson and his master's name on them. Now Mr. Thompson\r\nwhose situation in point of _popularity_ especially in his _own town_\r\nis not to be questioned, was very naturally surprised at his failure,\r\nand could not in his own mind attribute it to any thing short of\r\n\"_fraud and management_.\" He had failed in despite of the combined\r\nefforts of his partner and Mr. Kasson. Finding how poor doctor Child\r\nhad been cheated into a vote for three gentlemen whom Thompson\r\nconsidered mere tools compared to himself, it leaves him no doubt on\r\nthe subject, and he can no longer avoid bristling with astonishment and\r\nrage. Tho' several days before the convention met, a hue and cry was\r\nimmediately raised, and he repairs to court with almost the whole of\r\nthe McBain meeting at his heels--The convention till this year (1816)\r\nhad regularly met on the second day of April court.\r\n\r\nThe evil of this practice had been long felt and deplored by the\r\nadvocates for freedom of deliberation in this body, without being able\r\nto attain a remedy. The scenes of this day however have for a while\r\nsuspended, and I trust forever abolished the pernicious and degrading\r\npractice of _court_ conventions. Tuesday gave them leisure to organize\r\ntheir forces and reconnoiter the points of attack. On Wednesday these\r\nveteran lobby members of a county convention each knew his post, and\r\neach was prepared with his story. The members of the convention, living\r\nscattered in different directions, some near and some in the more\r\nremote towns, arrive in small parties of one, two, and three in\r\nsuccession, which gives full leisure to the court hangers on to see and\r\ndiscourse with them in detail, and the astonished members of the\r\nconvention the moment they arrive were thus assailed on all hands with\r\na universal cry of Young, Young, Young for the candidate. No scheme was\r\nleft untried, no pretence neglected, no argument overlooked, no path\r\nunexplored to entrap, to drive, to persuade and to lead the convention\r\ncontrary to their old established practice, to nominate Mr. Young a\r\n_third_ time as a candidate. Still despairing of success, Thompson and\r\nhis associates (I trust in God but few of them) change their ground and\r\nbecome the _black and unmanly assassins_ of individual character. The\r\nstory of the pretended fraud attempted by Mr. Palmer, Mr. Bunce and\r\nothers, was administered in profusion, and crammed down with epithets;\r\nnot more than two or three of the convention having ever heard the\r\naccount given of Mr Young by his worthy colleagues, and its reaching\r\nthem thus for the first time thro' his huffing friends, it sounded\r\ntruly like \"a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury, signifying\r\nnothing.\" Their pride was alarmed, and their sympathies excited, by\r\nbeing told that Judge Spencer had first cheated Mr. Young out of the\r\nSecretary's office, and that his wrath now burnt after him into the\r\ncounty of Saratoga, and what was passing strange--pitiful and wondrous\r\npitiful was, that the Judge had thrust his hand so far into this dish\r\nof woes as to employ in his service the press and Editor of the\r\nSaratoga Journal.--Kasson's letter which appears in \"the book,\" tho'\r\nnow altered by striking out Stillwell's name, arrives by _express from\r\nAlbany_, in season to make up for this dish, its last ingredient--But\r\nAlas! to no purpose; the people's delegates nominate Mr. Cowen.\r\n\r\nI boldly and solemnly appeal to that convention whether they or the\r\nmost of them were not individually called upon, by Thompson or some of\r\nthose acting under him, and urged to support Mr. Young upon part or all\r\nof the pretences above mentioned. In order to render assurance doubly\r\nsure, these strong and noisy opposers of fraud, these high minded and\r\nhonest politicians discover another circumstance of which they quickly\r\navail themselves. One of the towns had neglected to choose a committee.\r\nThe ceremony of packing was immediately resorted to, and three men who\r\nwere ready to go all lengths with these upright gentry, presented and\r\npalmed themselves upon the convention, as legitimate members. Thus\r\nhaving been belabored incessantly for two-thirds of an April day, the\r\nconvention retire to their duty, and as usual ballot for the\r\ncandidates. After balloting and before the votes were canvassed, they\r\nunanimously resolve, that the lawyer having the greatest number of\r\nvotes shall be considered the candidate, and the other rejected. After\r\ncanvassing and finding that Mr. Cowen had two votes more than Mr.\r\nYoung, it was again unanimously resolved that he be considered the\r\ncandidate.\r\n\r\nThis _arrogance_ and _presumption_ in the delegates of the people, was\r\nnot tamely to be endured by the _court party_; and these high-minded\r\nadvocates of _Republican purity_ immediately cast about for the means\r\nof correcting the evil. And what more easy and certain mode of doing\r\nthis, than to solicit and procure the friendly interference of\r\n_federalism_, whose doctrine by this time appears to be in perfect co\r\nincidence with their own? They could abhor coalition, management and\r\nintrigue in the ranks of Republicans;--nay the intrigue which owed its\r\nbirth and maturity to their heated imaginations alone, was odious and\r\nabominable in its fancied perpetrators; while they themselves were\r\nbasely courting the embraces of Federalism in secret; and building\r\ntheir hopes of success on the vile basis of a _political bargain_ with\r\nthat party;--like a drunken clergyman who enters the pulpit heated with\r\nhis bottle, and excites your disgust by a long discourse on the follies\r\nof intemperance. The high pretensions of these men to chastity and\r\nplain dealing, will be better tested by reading the following\r\ncertificates;--the reader being first reminded that Mr. Elihu Roe and\r\nJames Thompson, Esq. are holden forth both in _the book_, and in these\r\nstatements, as twin leaders--a sort of _Castor_ and _Pollux_ or\r\n_du_-umvirate in the tribe; and for this reason they are resorted to,\r\nas furnishing together with a few subordinate officers, a clue to the\r\nimmaculate character which they and their friends so loudly claim.\r\n\r\n     \"I certify, that I heard Elihu Roe declare, to Jonathan\r\n     Minor, at the store of Epenetus White, that James Thompson\r\n     Esq. had at the last election, made overtures to the\r\n     federalists to support Samuel Young Esq as a member of\r\n     Assembly.--BURR WAKEMAN. _March 1816_.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Thereby certify, that I had a conversation with Mr. Elihu\r\n     Roe, in the store of Epenetus White, in the presence of Mr.\r\n     Burr Wakeman, in which Mr. Roe declared that James Thompson\r\n     Esq. did propose to the federalists, to support a federal\r\n     candidate for member of Assembly, if the federalists would\r\n     support Samuel Young, Esq. as a candidate for member of\r\n     Assembly at the election of 1815.--JONATHAN MINOR. _Ballston,\r\n     March 28th 1816_.\"\r\n\r\n     \"I, Gideon Goodrich, late of the town of Milton, in the\r\n     county of Saratoga, do hereby certify to my fellow-citizens;\r\n     that on the first day of election of 1815 in said town, where\r\n     I then resided, at St. John's Inn, where the polls of\r\n     election were that day held, in a conversation on the subject\r\n     of supporting Samuel Young, contrary to the general\r\n     nomination; Archy Kasson, a leading friend of Young admitted\r\n     in presence of a number of persons, that he had said that he\r\n     had rather have three federalists go to the legislature from\r\n     this county with Young, than not to have Young elected. On my\r\n     expressing surprise at such sentiments, from a man professing\r\n     to be a republican, he added he still felt or thought so. Mr.\r\n     James Thompson who was present, then replied, that he would\r\n     say he had rather have _seven_ federalist go with Young, than\r\n     not to have him elected--or any number that would not give a\r\n     federal majority,[3] or words to that import.\r\n\r\n     \"Having removed from this county, but now on a visit at my\r\n     old residence in Milton, and being called upon by those who\r\n     feel themselves abused in the support of the cause of their\r\n     country, no one will consider it officiousness in me, to thus\r\n     repeat what was expressed in so public a manner on that\r\n     occasion.--GIDEON GOODRICH. _Milton, April 19th 1816_.\"\r\n\r\n     \"I hereby certify, that shortly after the last spring's\r\n     election, but before the official returns of election in the\r\n     state were received, I was at the office of James Thompson,\r\n     Esq. in Milton, and remarked to him, that I was afraid the\r\n     legislature would be federal, to which the said Thompson\r\n     replied, that he was afraid it would _not be federal_, or\r\n     that he began to be afraid there would not be _a federal_\r\n     house.

Mr.\r\n     Morehouse said he voted for Mr. Hamilton, the federal\r\n     candidate, to get a federalist in his town to vote for Mr.\r\n     Young; and the federal replied, that be voted for Mr. Young,\r\n     and that it was the understanding among some of the\r\n     federalists and _some_ of the republicans in Halfmoon, that\r\n     the federals should vote for Mr. Young, and that the\r\n     republicans should vote for Mr. Hamilton.

I also heard another federalist of Halfmoon then\r\n     present, say that he voted for Mr. Young also; and I\r\n     distinctly understood from them, that there had been an\r\n     understanding between the federalists and Mr. Young's\r\n     friends, to support Mr. Young and Mr. Hamilton as members of\r\n     Assembly.--ISAAC KELLOGG, jun.\"\r\n\r\nIt is also a fact, that Young's supporters did in two or three of the\r\ntowns _hide_ and _suppress_ the tickets printed by direction of the\r\ncounty convention, for Mr. Cowen and the other candidates.\r\n\r\nThese certificates and these facts serve then to explain how Mr. Young\r\ncame by a greater number of _votes_ than Mr. Cowen;--and no doubt is\r\nleft on this subject when on calculating from the _returns_, you\r\nperceive that the _votes_ for Mr. Young and Mr. Cowen in the aggregate\r\nexceed by a great number the whole votes for any other candidate on\r\neither side, and that _one_ of the federal candidates received a _less_\r\nnumber of votes than the others. This would of itself shew as far as\r\nthe subject is susceptible of proof, a _bargain_ between _some_ of Mr.\r\nYoung's friends and _some_ of the federalists. Shortly after this\r\nbargain which Mr. Roe speaks of, the McBain Meeting[4] was called,\r\nwhere every exertion tended to produce a political abortion.\r\n\r\nI cordially join with \"the book\" in censuring the editor of the Journal\r\nfor resembling this meeting to a political _funeral_;--for I do not\r\nbelieve that the lifeless _embryo_ which it bro't forth, ever raised\r\nthe tho't of a _funeral_ in its poor _distracted father_. And while I\r\ncould not have the face to vindicate him from falsehood in not making a\r\nbetter distinction, I should feel the less inclined to deny his being a\r\nsavage, while I behold him wantoning with the wounded feelings of a\r\nforlorn, hopeless and unhappy _parent_. If his personification had\r\nembraced the meeting merely, he ought to have known that even the\r\n_dead_ are not always unavenged, and that its ghost at least, would\r\nhave arisen from the tomb to flutter round and haunt the unhappy county\r\nof Saratoga on the eve of the next nomination, in the form of a _book_;\r\nthat thing which like the poet is justly admired for giving\r\n\r\n              \"To airy nothing,\r\n  A local habitation and a name.\"\r\n\r\nWe could hardly say of that book, however, as Hamlet said of his\r\nFather's ghost that\r\n\r\n  \"He would take his word for a thousand pounds\"--\r\n\r\nOr why do we hear it insisted that the fault of keeping alive discord\r\nand division in the county, is imputable to a few individuals named and\r\npointed out by it?--Aside from the base and unprincipled attempts of\r\nRoe, Thompson and some of their co-adjutors, to prostrate the only\r\n_republican press_ in the county, by a system of slander and\r\ndetraction; The public cannot have forgotten that Mr Young's _famous_\r\ncolleagues were mildly and publicly invited to an amicable explanation,\r\nwhich they refused and rendered the publication of affidavits necessary\r\nin justification. The only reply which was received, was a still more\r\ngeneral, malignant and furious attack upon the press, not only from the\r\ncolumns of the Schenectady Cabinet, but the foul lingo of Roe, Thompson\r\n& co. with bitter complaints whenever that press either ridiculed their\r\nfolly and impertinence, or defended itself against their insidious and\r\nsecret attempts to effect its destruction.\r\n\r\nAmongst other things in order to create a pretence for their _book_, it\r\nwill be recollected that judge Child has authorised the charge of\r\nfalsehood against the Journal in its maintaining that he had threatened\r\nto get a new press into the county &c.--Indeed the judge appears to be\r\nremarkably well pleased with that production, not only by his long\r\ncertificates, but by a letter which he afterwards wrote to the printer\r\nof the _Courier_, recognizing its merits and trying to _divide with\r\nfederalists_ the honor of carrying clothes to the army;[5] which it\r\nseems was given him by the _book_ in order to render his standing as a\r\ncertifier more conspicuous, by uniting on his broad brow, both the\r\n_military_ and _civic_ wreath. How far the _denial_ of this mock\r\n_Cincinnatus_ that he threatened as early as May to get a new press,\r\n\"_with all his blushing honors thick upon him_,\" will satisfy the\r\npublic, may in some measure he determined by the following certificate.\r\n\r\n     \"I hereby solemnly certify, that on the last of May or first\r\n     of June last, when at the house of Judge Child, in a\r\n     conversation relating to the Saratoga Journal, and the\r\n     conduct of its Editor Mr. Isaiah Bunce, the said Judge then\r\n     and there made use of the following expression to me, viz.\r\n     'You must remember that the friends of Mr. Young, are not men\r\n     of the _least property_, nor _least influence_ in the County,\r\n     and Bunce may have _another press set up by his side_ in less\r\n     than six months--That he [the said Judge] should withdraw his\r\n     support from him, and said that it was best for every one to\r\n     do the same, and then his press would fall of course.' And at\r\n     the same time said, that he had rather _support the federal\r\n     press at the Springs_ than the _Journal_. Shortly after this\r\n     I informed Mr. Bunce of the above conversation at his\r\n     office.'--JONATHAN WESTCOTT. _Milton, March 14th 1816_.\"\r\n\r\nYoung and Thompson made similar declarations of their intention to get\r\nanother press about the same time, with which they have been often\r\ncharged, and it seems thought best not to hazard a denial in the\r\nbook--therefore no other certificate but the one relating to Child's\r\nhas been procured--And the judge's conduct would have been more\r\nchristian-like, had he written a letter exculpating the editor of the\r\nJournal from an undeserved odium cast upon him by his authority, than\r\nthus to have given it confirmation and support, at the same time\r\nknowing it to be _untrue_.\r\n\r\nOf a piece with this however, appears to have been his previous conduct\r\nabout the time of his presiding over the _abortion_ at McBains. I\r\nallude to his sending the history of that meeting with orders by\r\nThompson and Stillwell, to the editor of the Journal to print without\r\nreading it.\r\n\r\n     \"I Lyman B. Langworthy, of the village of Ballston Spa, do\r\n     certify to my fellow-citizens the following facts;--That on\r\n     the night of the 20th April 1815, two days after the McBain\r\n     meeting--being in the office of the Saratoga Journal late in\r\n     the evening, James Thompson, James Merrill and Wm. Stillwell,\r\n     Esqs. came into the room. Immediately after being seated, Mr.\r\n     Thompson who acted as chief speaker, pompously displayed a\r\n     fold of paper which he wished Mr. Bunce to print off in the\r\n     form of Handbills by morning, it being then quite late. Mr.\r\n     Bunce wished to see it and its contents.\r\n\r\n     \"Here Mr. Thompson to my astonishment flatly refused, unless\r\n     Mr. B. would first promise on his word and honor that he\r\n     would _positively_ and _unconditionally_ agree to print it\r\n     _let it contain what it would_. This bro't on a long parley;\r\n     Mr. Bunce wished to see it if for nothing more than to shew\r\n     his workman its length, to learn from him whether it was\r\n     possible to execute it in the time allowed. Mr. Thompson\r\n     refused, and entered pretty lengthy into the subject, in his\r\n     _precise roundabout_ manner: asserting that it was _none of\r\n     his business what it contained_--that it was impertinent in a\r\n     '_mechanic_' to ask his employers the use or destination of\r\n     any work he should employ him to do; and frequently by way of\r\n     a _salve_ interlarding his conversation with '_we do not wish\r\n     you to do it for nothing Mr. Bunce, we have money enough_.'\r\n     After much chaffering between the parties, judge Stillwell in\r\n     a very candid manner, desired that the paper might be read,\r\n     asking him if it _contained any thing they were ashamed of_.\r\n     Mr. Thompson then looked to Mr. Merrill as for his opinion.\r\n     Mr. Merrill said with some warmth, 'he shan't see it.' This\r\n     brot' on considerable bickerings--crimination and\r\n     re-crimination between Mess. Bunce, and Thompson, which judge\r\n     Stillwell tho't rather indecorous, and quite earnestly\r\n     rebuked the two gentlemen for their wrath, and at the same\r\n     time said he thot' it high time to deliver judge Child's\r\n     message. Here Mr. Thompson apparently supposing himself only\r\n     entrusted with the charge, seemed not to understand.--After a\r\n     great deal of argument, the paper at last had a 'first\r\n     reading,' & was the proceedings of the McBain meeting, signed\r\n     by Child, Thompson and Stillwell; and was delivered to Mr.\r\n     Bunce, to shew his compositor, who was in bed. Mr. Bunce\r\n     insisted that some of the gentlemen should deliver the\r\n     message which judge Stillwell seemed to be so anxious about.\r\n     Here the three gentlemen were thrown into great\r\n     confusion--eyed each other as though each supposed the other\r\n     ignorant of what he himself knew. Judge Stillwell's\r\n     countenance seemed to labor with something which he was bound\r\n     to reveal; and Mr. Thompson noting this, desired judge\r\n     Stillwell _if he knew it to let it out_. Judge Stillwell then\r\n     putting himself in an attitude corresponding, as he appeared\r\n     to think, with the magnitude of the subject, began by saying\r\n     that judge Child had instructed him to say to Mr. Bunce,\r\n     _that he had always been a particular friend of his--had\r\n     always given him all of his business--and should be sorry to\r\n     withdraw it after the friendly intercourse which had\r\n     subsisted between them--that it was the earnest desire of\r\n     judge Child that Mr. Bunce should have the refusal of\r\n     printing it; 'but as a last resort say to him from me, that\r\n     if he refuses to print it as desired by Mr. Thompson, that I\r\n     forever withdraw my patronage from his press.'_\"\r\n\r\nHere Mr. Bunce indignantly threw back the paper to Mr. Thompson, and\r\ndeclared that under those circumstances he should not print it--saying\r\nthat after buffeting the storm of federalism, and the dark days of the\r\nwars of our country, he little expected such treatment from one whose\r\nduty it was to protect the press &c. &c.--and it was after much\r\npersuasion, and partly through my own importunities, that he was\r\ninduced to print it.\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Bunce's conduct through the whole transaction, which\r\n     must have lasted two hours or more, was _consistent, firm_\r\n     and _independent_ to my conception, as was the others\r\n     _haughty_, _supercilious_ and _overbearing_.--Lyman B.\r\n     Langworthy. _March, 1816_.\"\r\n\r\nHere fellow citizens is the _iron club of power_ held over the head of\r\nan editor of a _free press_, during an election--to coerce him and his\r\npress into obedience to their dictates. What are we coming to when men\r\nhigh in office use their offices, influence and patronage to control\r\nthe freedom of the press, which all the champions of freedom esteem the\r\norgan and safeguard of our _liberties_--and attempt to compell it to\r\nbend to their purposes--to sell itself and rush _blind fold_ on any\r\nmeasure their interest or ambition may dictate?\r\n\r\nThe independent conduct of Mr. Bunce on this occasion was probably one\r\nreason among _others_ why the judge aided in the introduction of\r\nanother printer of the more _pliant sort_; who would more readily bend\r\nto his purposes and serve as a pipe with which his friends Roe,\r\nThompson, Stillwell &c. could spit their venom thro' the county in the\r\nmore permanent form of a _pamphlet_.\r\n\r\nIn this, with _three_ insolvent advertisements staring him in the face\r\nfrom the _Independent American_, the judge denies, or sanctions a\r\ndenial, that he ever ordered an advertisement to be printed in that\r\npaper _at all_. Unblushing impudence indeed!--Thus to ask the public to\r\npervert the eternal principles of truth and justice by giving credit to\r\nsuch assertions as these.\r\n\r\nThe examination of a few more topics under this head shall\r\nsuffice.--Indeed amongst the disgusting details of falsehood and\r\nmeanness with which that production abounds; you find many remarks\r\nimputed to the Journal which it never made, while those which it has\r\nmade, on examination will be found strictly true.\r\n\r\nThe writer of that pamphlet is guilty of falsehood in asserting that\r\nthe _editorial_ remarks of the Journal are not copied into other\r\npapers. Not to mention others, they have been copied the year past in\r\nseveral instances, by the _National Intelligencer_ at Washington, and\r\nby _Niles' Weekly Register_ at Baltimore, two of the ablest papers in\r\nthe _Union_. The remarks which the book falsely calls a _scurrilous\r\nattack_ upon the _Governor_, instead of being an attack on him, it so\r\nhappens that they were merely calculated to let the public know what\r\nevery republican had a right to expect, and which they in fact\r\n_realized_ from our worthy chief magistrate in the season of peril\r\nwhich dictated them.--They were such as he would himself approve, while\r\nhe would frown contemptuously on the _little fry_ who attempt so base a\r\nslander in his name. Would to God the conduct of some of the governor's\r\nfawning and pretended admirers could endure investigation like that of\r\nthis great and good man--the pride and ornament of his country!\r\n\r\nAs to the charge against the Journal for asserting that the first judge\r\nand others had combined to domineer and rule the people of this county,\r\nyou already have a taste of the judge's fondness for domineering over\r\nsome of the people, and over their press; and that other persons named\r\nhave _acted_ in concert with him is equally true and notorious;--And it\r\nis hardly necessary to enquire whether they combined for the purpose,\r\nor instinctively assembled like birds of the same feather, from a\r\ncommon spirit of domination. It is false, however, that the Journal\r\never made such a charge. This and a number of these remarks are only\r\nsuffering them to wear a coat which they themselves have cut out of\r\nwhole cloth, and which seems to fit them so exactly. That paper never\r\ncharged Mr. Young with any management or compromise with the\r\nfederalists, further than what justly resulted from his being chosen\r\n_supervisor_ in _Ballston_ by _federalists_, contrary to the _regular\r\ntown nomination_, and his afterwards being complimented by the federal\r\npaper as a modern political _Luther_, on account of his having quit his\r\nown party in that town and submitted to federal policy, not denied by\r\nthe _book_--from his having _aided_ in the election of the _federal\r\ncandidate for Congress_ in the fall of 1812; and from his \"at least\"\r\nconniving at _federal aid_, in the spring of 1815--all of which are\r\nfacts of too general notoriety to be denied.\r\n\r\nBut the Journal did charge some of Mr. Young's friends with a\r\n_political understanding_ between them and the federalists, which is\r\nnot only passed over in silence by the _book_, but proved by the\r\nforegoing estimates and certificates.\r\n\r\nOn seeing Mr. Young supporting, and supported in his turn by a Senator\r\nor Senators of this state for office, the Journal did ask the question,\r\nwhether it was pursuant to an _arrangement_ on the subject between\r\nthem? This question was put in the Journal directly to Mr.\r\nYoung--taking it for granted that Mr. Young has adopted the language in\r\nthe book on this question as his own, this might be received as an\r\n_answer_, had not a mere _question_ been first perverted into a charge.\r\n\r\nThe Journal did also ask him the question, whether he intended to make\r\n_one Joel Lee, clerk of this county?_ To which the book, replies that\r\nhe never promised any office to any man whatever. It is perhaps\r\nnecessary, in justice to the Editor of the Journal, to introduce the\r\nfollowing certificate, and leave this part of the subject without\r\nfarther comment.\r\n\r\n     \"I hereby certify, that shortly after the appointment of Wm.\r\n     Stillwell, as a clerk, of this county, I was in the city of\r\n     Albany, and conversed with Mr. Young on the subject of that\r\n     appointment, in which conversation I expressed my surprise at\r\n     his appointment, to which Mr. Young replied, it was not his\r\n     fault, that there was a petition for him from some of the\r\n     most respectable men in the county, and it would not do for\r\n     him to oppose it, but that his mind was the strongest on\r\n     _Joel Lee_ for that office.--ELI BEARDSLEE. _Milton, March\r\n     1816_.\"\r\n\r\nAmong others to whom Lee admitted he had been promised of _offered_ the\r\nClerk's office by Young, is Mr. Nicholas Smith, but it is thought\r\nunnecessary to multiply certificates on this head.\r\n\r\nThe writer of that pamphlet also displays his characteristic ignorance,\r\nor stupid disregard to truth, when he says that the Journal ever\r\ncharged Young with receiving pay in three capacities, during the _extra\r\nsession_ of 1815. It never made the charge as it respected _that_, or\r\nany other _year_;--but it so happens that during the _extra, session_\r\nof 1814, Mr. Young did receive $5 per day, which was the pay for a\r\nmember of the house, and $2.25 per day, which was the _extra allowance_\r\non account of his being speaker. See New Revised Laws, Vol. I. p. 528,\r\nand the act of April 18th 1815, called the _supply bill_, Sec. 15, by\r\nwhich two acts, the wages of the Assembly are fixed at _$5_, and those\r\nof the speaker at $7.25, and extended to the extra session of 1814.\r\nAltho' the Journal _never_ made the charge imputed to it, yet you see\r\nhow easily and conclusively that charge might have been supported, had\r\nthe assertion ever been made.\r\n\r\nWith regard to Mr. Young's receiving the pay of a Col. he never was\r\ncharged with having done this during any _extra session_. That paper\r\ndid insinuate that he at one time as aid to the governor received that\r\npay. And it is hardly worth stopping to enquire whether he did or not,\r\nso long as we have _his word_ that the Governor _offered_ it to him, in\r\nconsequence of which he _agreed_ to serve. Whether he got the _cash_\r\nand gave a _receipt_ for it;--or it was absorbed in his _expences_;--or\r\nlaid it out to buy another press;--or yet _remains due_, is altogether\r\nimmaterial, so long as an answer is substantially made out to a\r\nquestion raised by his _good friends_, and to which the public may\r\nexpect a reply: The following certificate is therefore given without\r\ncomment.\r\n\r\n     \"I certify, that a day or two previous to Samuel Young's\r\n     accompanying his excellency the Governor to New-York, in\r\n     conversation with Mr. Young at his house, he informed me that\r\n     while he was at Albany, from where he had but just returned,\r\n     he called on his excellency, who then informed him of his\r\n     intended expedition to New-York, and pressed him, Mr. Young\r\n     to accompany him; that he objected, and said that he should\r\n     be much pleased with the jaunt, but his business was such, as\r\n     to render it impossible; that the Governor urged him still\r\n     stronger, and he replied that he was wholly unprepared for\r\n     leaving home any length of time, and the Governor calculated\r\n     to go the next day or day but one--that the Governor told him\r\n     if he would accompany him, he would make him _an aid_ with\r\n     the _pay_ of a _colonel_, and _bear his expences_, and that\r\n     he would defer going until the next steam boat; that he\r\n     wished to take time to consider the Governor's proposals as\r\n     he informed the Governor--and soon after told him he would\r\n     accompany him.--SETH C. BALDWIN, Junior. _Warren County,\r\n     March 1816_.\"\r\n\r\nThe Journal never charged Young with having informed Merrill that he\r\n\"was not now Secretary, but should be to-morrow.\" At it again Merrill.\r\nWill you certify that you did not give a friendly hint to a gentleman\r\nwho was going to Albany, that you had a connexion who would make an\r\nexcellent clerk in the Secretary's office, and request his name to be\r\ngiven to Mr. Young, to whom Young replied, _I am not now Secretary but\r\nshall be to-morrow_? I believe an intimation to this effect was given\r\nin the Journal, which you blink with as much ingenuity as though you\r\nhad been bred in the same school with Mr. Young's colleagues. Amongst\r\nthe great number to whom Mr. Young _did give_ the information that he\r\nwas shortly to be Secretary, _you_, then it seems were omitted!\r\n\r\nThe facts disclosed in the following certificate, cannot fail to remind\r\none of the fable of the \"Country maid, and her milk pail.\"\r\n\r\n     \"I hereby certify, that while riding in company with Samuel\r\n     Young from Ballston to Albany, when going to the _winter\r\n     session_ of 1815, the day before the legislature met, the\r\n     said Young informed me that he expected to be Secretary of\r\n     State when the republican council should be chosen; that he\r\n     could be a member of the _legislature_ and _Secretary of\r\n     State at the same time_, and _could reside at the Springs_ or\r\n     Ballstown in the summer, and do the business of Secretary in\r\n     Albany by Deputy, and that _these two_ offices would give him\r\n     a _pretty good living_, or words to that effect.--JESUP\r\n     RAYMOND. _Ballston, April 1816_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Green--let me consider; yes, green becomes my complexion best, and\r\ngreen it shall be.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Kasson, was early spoken of by the _Independent American_ as an\r\napplicant for the _Sheriff's office_, and as it appeals, was afterwards\r\na candidate for the county convention, and pledged to the support of\r\nMr. Young. In consequence of this, the Journal did ask the question to\r\nMr. Young, whether he intended Mr. Kasson as the Sheriff of this\r\ncounty?--and nothing more. I think a farther inquiry was made whether\r\nhe was not authorised to purchase a \"_mansion house_ for the _new\r\nsecretary_, in the village of Ballston Spa?\" on which he preserves a\r\ncautious silence.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable in this and other instances, with what industry _The\r\nCitizen_ manufactures assertions to suit his own purpose, and then\r\ndenies them. Having at length exhausted his fancy in fabricating,\r\nshaping and denying particular charges, hardly one of which ever\r\nexisted, he ranges up his whole artillery of vengeance;--the battle\r\nbecomes general:--And the famous Doctor Slop, the man midwife, did not\r\npour a more copious and continued shower of curses upon Obadiah, who\r\nhad tied his bag of instruments with hard knots, than is thus suddenly\r\nlet fly upon the devoted head of the Editor of the Saratoga Journal.\r\n\"_Really_\" said the Frenchman to an old woman who had been storming and\r\nfretting at Napoleon, \"the Emperor, my master would feel himself\r\ninfinitely grieved, if he knew how hard your _lady-ship_ thought of\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nBut it seems the Editor of the Journal \"has indulged himself in a\r\ncourse of low and vulgar sarcasms,\" tho' no particular instance is\r\npointed out. Thus the citizen, after sending his friend, Mr. Elias\r\nBenedict, into the bar-room, to certify the _damns_ and _god damns_ of\r\nMr. Wilkins, suddenly becomes extremely modest and refined, and falls\r\nto moralizing like Michael Cassio, after his _own_ drunken fit is over.\r\nMr. Bunce might really be esteemed far gone, had he reached the climax\r\nof vulgarity which distinguishes the _citizen_ and his _book_.\r\n\r\nBut says the _book_ in another place, \"the manners of Mr. Bunce are\r\n_coarse and vulgar_.\" I suppose an immediate allusion is here intended\r\nto the _manner_ in which he treated _Stillwell_ and _Thompson's_\r\nsupercilious proposition to agree to print their famous history of the\r\nMcBain Meeting, without reading it, under penalty of losing the first\r\nJudge's patronage in case of a refusal. Perhaps they mean that he did\r\nnot on that occasion, turn out his toes exactly as he ought; or make a\r\nbecoming bow to so much mock consequence as surrounded them. I know not\r\nin what language to describe their notions. We have already admitted\r\nthat Mr. Bunce does not pretend to vie in _purity_ of dialect with the\r\ncertificate of Mr. Elias Benedict. Suppose we also admit that he cannot\r\nhold competition with Roe as a profound _linguist_--with Mr. Thompson\r\nin _fairness_, _high mindedness_, _openness_ and _candor_--nor with Mr.\r\nLinnendoll in belleslettres--and that he would not make so good a\r\n_dancing master_ as Mr James Merrill[6] and leave the public to judge\r\nwhether coming short of these qualifications, he can be any way\r\ntolerable in his person or polished in his conversation.\r\n\r\nBut 'tis said again, that he has presented some of our citizens \"in the\r\nludicrous attitude of being in chase of one of the wheels of a\r\n_political hack_.\" This plain farmer-like simile has given great\r\noffence, and perhaps justly, to the high and refined notions of certain\r\nbook gentry; who have been too much in the habit of _hunting_ an\r\n_office_, or _chasing_ a _dollar_, to believe that the idea of so\r\nordinary an occupation, could ever have been connected with that of\r\nsuch _great men_ as themselves.\r\n\r\nIt may not be amiss to here remark, that Mr. Bunce was admitted an\r\nAttorney of the Supreme Court in 1804; he settled in the village of\r\nSalina in the county of Onondaga; shortly afterwards it was made a post\r\ntown, and he was appointed Post-Master[7] by the general government,\r\nand continued in that office until he removed from that place. Soon\r\nafter his removal to Bridgewater, Oneida County, he was appointed\r\nPost-Master at that place, and continued in that office until he\r\nresigned on his removal to the county of Saratoga. During his residence\r\nin the Western District, he attended with industry and fidelity to the\r\nprofession in which he was educated.\r\n\r\nSoon after the declaration of war he concluded to quit the practice of\r\nlaw, and purchased the establishment of the Republican press of this\r\ncounty, and became the editor of the Journal.\r\n\r\nMr. Bunce has been a faithful, able, zealous and indefatigable\r\nsupporter and defender of our republican institutions, and of the\r\nmeasures of our general and state government; and I confidently ask,\r\nwho ever accused him till this faction commenced their operations.\r\nDuring the memorable campaign of 1814, he was not only vigilant and\r\nfaithful to our rights as an editor; but when danger threatened from\r\nall quarters, he hired, equipped, and sent a common soldier into the\r\nfield for the defence of New-York.\r\n\r\nSeveral who were active in introducing Mr. Bunce to the republicans of\r\nthis county, after finding him too independent to bend to their\r\n\"_particular_\" views, and after he had rejected with disdain their\r\nproffers to surrender to them his rights as an editor, they formed\r\nthemselves into a court of Inquisition, and ushered forth their courtly\r\nmandates \"Bunce must be sacrificed\" \"the Journal shall go down,\" even\r\nthis proscription extended to his family, and to his fireside; and so\r\neager were certain of these factionists, that they formed a plan to\r\nbreak up his establishment by _force_, and actually threatened _to\r\nscatter his types_. This fact is too susceptible of proof to be denied.\r\n\r\nThe republicans for a long time were silent spectators, while viewing\r\nthe persecution of their editor, and attack upon their own rights and\r\nprivileges; they fondly hoped, that time would cure the evil, and sober\r\nreflection convince them of their error; but in this hope they were\r\ndisappointed, their persecutions encreased; and to them more certainly\r\nto effect their object, and encouraged by the smiles of federalists,\r\nthey secretly brought a new printing press into the county--it was then\r\nthe designs of these men were more apparent--it was then the\r\nrepublicans proclaimed their rights, and spoke to these \"conspirators\"\r\nin language too loud not to be heard--too emphatic not to be\r\nunderstood. And as long as these \"conspirators\" continue their press to\r\nwar against the rights and privileges of the people, Mr. Bunce as a\r\nfaithful centinel, will remain firm at his post. What though a gang of\r\noffice-holders should \"in the mild spirit of Christian humility\" (see\r\npage 7 of the book) fulminate their maledictions against him; the\r\npeople will not be frightened into submission, nor the editor from his\r\nduty.\r\n\r\nBut the Editor of the Journal has abused some of us, say they--Does the\r\n_truth_ abuse them? does the _exposition_ of the _foulest combination_\r\nthat ever disgraced this or any other county, _constitute abuse_? Is\r\nthere such terrible majesty surrounding an _office_? No matter of what\r\n_misrepresentations_ they are the authors of--No matter how _basely_\r\nand _shamefully_ they have _belied and slandered their neighbors_--No\r\nmatter of what deception, hypocrisy and intrigue, they are guilty--No\r\nmatter how long they have conspired against the rights and privileges\r\nof the people--No matter how unbecoming, gross and absurd their conduct\r\nmay have been; if an independent Editor, in vindicating the rights of\r\nthe people, and those of his own, questions the propriety of their\r\nconduct; they immediately skulk behind their offices, and impudently\r\nexclaim, \"_touch us not--we are privileged_.\" 'Pigmies are Pigmies\r\nstill tho' perch'd on Alps.'\r\n\r\nWhile I would not refrain from censuring the improper conduct of these\r\noffice _leaders_, I shall ever be ready to extend the hand of\r\nfellowship to such as have been deluded by them--Nay, I would go\r\nfarther, let _them_ exhibit signs of repentance--let them evince a\r\ndetermination to support our republican rights---let them cease to war\r\nagainst the people, their editor, and individuals--let them remove\r\ntheir _pensioned_ press--then shall they have my voice and my heart, to\r\nintercede for them with an insulted and abused community.\r\n\r\nBut faint indeed is the hope of a reformation in _that_ man who\r\nviolates all honor, truth and decency. Who but the author[8] of that\r\nbook would charge the Milton committee, of being the tools of \"fraud\r\nand management?\" Who but him would affix the charge of \"miscreants\" to\r\nthe republicans of Galway, Milton, Greenfield, Saratoga, Malta and\r\nBallston? Who but him would have the unblushing effrontery to publish,\r\n\"_that the general committee in nominating Mr. Cowen, instead of Mr.\r\nYoung, committed an OUTRAGE on the feelings and wishes of their\r\nconstituents_?\" [see page 8. of that pamphlet.] Who but the author of\r\nthat pamphlet would--but I beg pardon--read the pamphlet itself, and\r\nyou have abundant evidence of the authors views, his principles, his\r\nheart and his designs.\r\n\r\nBut the vengeful serpents of malice and persecution have not confined\r\ntheir labors to _the book_, Early last spring, a thrust was made at the\r\nEditor of the Journal, on the authority _it was said_ of Mr. Hackley,\r\nlate a member from Herkimer, who _(so Thompson said)_ had authorised\r\nhim to tell the people, that Mr. Bunce was unworthy of\r\nconfidence:--nay, to make use of a number of debasing epithets,--such\r\nas would quadrate with the palate of Roe or Thompson, much better than\r\nthat of a gentleman like Mr. Hackley. But as this gentleman has\r\ndeclined appearing in the book, and certainly never did, and never\r\nwould authorize Thompson to use his name for the vile purpose in which\r\nhe employed it, I barely glance at this circumstance as one article,\r\nwhich would otherwise have been pressed into the Pandoras box which has\r\nbeen so industriously served up for the public.\r\n\r\nInstead of atoning by a mild, moderate and conciliatory course of\r\nconduct, for the injuries attempted, not only against an individual,\r\nbut the public, in endeavoring to put down and destroy a free press;\r\nthe project is set on foot of introducing and palming upon the county\r\nanother press;--a child of their own;--a copartner in all their labors,\r\ntheir joys and sorrows. It is however, _one thing_ to introduce a\r\npress, and _another_ to get the _people_ to support it. While a few\r\nmalicious imps, hungering for revenge, were \"_grinning horrible a\r\nghastly smile, to hear their famine should be filled_;\" the people in a\r\nnumber of different towns assembled, and freely expressed their\r\nsentiments on the fatal tendency of such measures; and animadverted\r\nwith freedom and spirit on the motives which prompted them;--for which\r\nthe book printed by the printer of their paper, stigmatizes them with\r\nthe epithet of _miscreants_; and treats the whole of their labors as\r\nmere _cant and slang_; I suppose it must mean compared with its own\r\ndignified and masterly pages. _The majesty of the people_ is truly a\r\n_monstrous Deity_ in the eye of venal and sell-created consequence. It\r\nis merely for repeating _some of the sentiments expressed at these\r\nmeetings_, that the editor of the Journal is assailed as the\r\narch-disturber of our political repose.\r\n\r\n_The Citizen_, in one place storms furiously at the allegation, that\r\nthe _Albany committee_ had advised them to remove their press. That\r\ncommittee was appointed to inquire into the difficulties which agitated\r\nthe republican family in this county, and devise if possible the means\r\nof removing them. Thompson as _chief cook_ of his own party, appeared\r\nbefore them, with the book in his hand and Judge Child at his elbow _as\r\nusual_; and I do believe the citizen from my very soul, when he says\r\nthey gave him no such advice. The committee were composed of _sensible_\r\nmen; and after listening to his incoherent display of folly and\r\nnonsense on that occasion, it would be literally casting pearl before\r\n_swine_, to have given them any advice on the subject.\r\n\r\nHaving established and considered some extraneous facts, for which I am\r\naware certain _gentlemen_ will not thank me especially as it may\r\ndisorder the thread of their own reasoning a little; I shall now\r\nproceed briefly to consider the charge of FRAUD, FALSEHOOD, DUPLICITY\r\nand CORRUPTION, as it appears in the book itself, on their own proof,\r\nindependent of the foregoing _memorandums_, leaving the memory of Mr.\r\nYoung's _colleagues_ and others at full leisure to be refreshed by\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThat charge it will be recollected, is the turning point of the\r\ncontroversy;--the _vox et preterea nihil_, which _boils, and foams, and\r\nwheels_ thro' _the book_, like a torrent thro' the _Augean_ stable,\r\ncollecting in its course accretions of foulness and impurity. For this\r\npurpose, Mr. _Bunce_ and Mr. _Palmer_ are represented as a political\r\n_Archimedes_, controlling at their will the destinies of the\r\ncounty;--dictating the number and sort and deliberations of the county\r\ndelegates, prostrating the Speaker of the house of assembly; and\r\ndealing _havoc, spoil_ and _ruin_ around them. Mr. Cowen is represented\r\nas their associate, aiming at his own elevation thro' the lowest arts\r\nof cunning and duplicity. But fortunately for the cause of common\r\nsense, the touch-stone of these mighty maggots of the brain are the\r\n_facts_ on which they are founded. And here let us for a moment take\r\nthem as they stand among the certificate gentry, and examine their\r\nactual bearings;--in doing which I shall still have occasion to mention\r\nnames, who, if they have finally not much cause for self gratulation,\r\nmust thank their good friend _the Citizen_ for bringing them before the\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nThe Motts[9] say, that on or about the 21st of March, Mr. _Cowen_ told\r\nthem that _Young_ was becoming _unpopular_;--that he had behaved\r\nhaughtily and disrespectfully towards his colleagues; and that a few\r\ndays before, he had been informed of this fact by several gentlemen to\r\nwhom they were referred. Now it will be recollected that Mr. Cowen and\r\nJohn R. Mott were two of the _delegates_ from Saratoga, and as such\r\nmutually bound to discuss with freedom the _allegation for and against_\r\nMr Young, or any other person who would be a candidate before the\r\ngeneral committee; and Mr. Cowen at this time _at least_, had no reason\r\nto doubt the truth of what Young's colleagues had asserted. He also\r\nmentioned it to James Mott, who was spoken of as a substitute in the\r\nevent of his brother's absence. It seems he also conversed freely with\r\nthese men on the subject of _his_ having consented to be considered a\r\ncandidate, and (so James Mott says) examined the probability of his\r\nsuccess, by calculating the favorable state of the delegation. But it\r\nseems that communications to these _leaky gentlemen_ on the subject of\r\ncandidates are not to be made under any circumstances with impunity;\r\nand Mr. Cowen is to be censured as _criminal_ for giving that\r\ninformation, which it would have been _criminal_ to withhold. The only\r\nway to make his act in this respect _criminal_ is by saying, \"he ought\r\nto have known that Young's colleagues had _lied_.\" But it will be\r\nrecollected that this was impossible, for the public did not know them\r\n_then_ as well as it does _now_; nor had Mr. Cowen yet seen their\r\n_certificate_ which is herewith published, by which they acknowledge\r\n_what the book_ is so anxious for Mr. Cowen to have assumed. He did\r\nafterwards see it, and then (so say the certificates) bore public\r\ntestimony to his opinion of the merits of Mr. Young, as well as\r\nafterwards by letter to judge Child.\r\n\r\nThus does the charge of duplicity, made against Mr. Cowen, resolve\r\nitself into a base attempt to fix upon him, what so snugly suits the\r\nshoulders of others. It seems he finally bestows that justice upon a\r\n_political adversary_, which the baseness and treachery of his\r\n_colleagues_ and pretended friends had withheld. Am I acting the part\r\nof an accuser towards those men? No. They have accused themselves. Why\r\nare they again before the public? Had they hopes of skulking into\r\nobscurity among the _motley_ multitude of certificates which throng the\r\nfolio of _the book_? or have they like one of the moral personages in\r\n_Hudibras_, \"_catch'd the itch on purpose to be scratch'd_?\" It now\r\nrequires an eye less keen than that of a ministering spirit to pierce\r\nthe cob web veil which shields them from detection.\r\n\r\nBut in the process of this investigation, we are led to the\r\nconsideration of a subject \"_too awful for irony_.\" The interested\r\ncertificates of these men are ushered to a Christian public, and a\r\nhigher sanction demanded for them, by the author, than he is willing to\r\nallow to facts attested under the _solemnity_ of _an oath_. One could\r\nhardly have anticipated this _atheistical_ appeal to the credulity of\r\nthe public, even tho' human nature were as vile and monstrous in\r\n_others_, as it appears to be in _that author_. But perhaps there was a\r\nnecessity for it, in order to preserve the _dark_ uniformity of his\r\nproduction. If, as has been asserted more than _one_ of his prominent\r\ncertifiers (among whom I would by no means rank these men) are\r\nthemselves _atheists_, what could he swear them upon?--Upon the\r\nevangelists think you?--He might as well swear them on Payn's age of\r\nreason, or his own vile book itself. Where they \"believe that their\r\nmiserable bodies must take eternal refuge in the grave, and the last\r\npuff of their nostrils will send their souls to annihilation, they\r\nlaugh at the solemnity of an oath and tell you that the grave into\r\nwhich they sink as a log, forms an intrenchment against the throne of\r\nGod, and the vengeance of exasperated justice!\" Such is the character\r\nwhich the writer fixes upon _himself_.--Such is the character which\r\nseveral of his _disciples_ sustain in public.\r\n\r\nTrue, the falsity of an extra-judicial oath, carries with it no\r\n_temporal_ punishment; but the _moral obligation_ remains to give it\r\nvalidity. That _eternal reward or punishment_ which the _Citizen_ has\r\ntaken so much pains to blot out from the mind of his readers, will\r\nstill continue the delight and terror of the Christian, the eternal\r\nfountain of his hopes and fears;--with him a sufficient motive to\r\ntruth, without the artificial and imperfect aid of _national law_. The\r\naffidavits of four or five _credible witnesses_ were already before the\r\npublic, that Mr. Young's Colleagues did make a charge against him; but\r\nit seems that every moral sanction must be trampled upon or trifled\r\nwith by the _Citizen_, to secure a triumph for his false and infidel\r\nprinciples. He skips, like a grasshopper, over facts and premises and\r\npropositions, and perches upon his pitiful assertions, which he wishes\r\nthe public to pervert into conclusions. Why did he not give these\r\naffidavits lo the public?--He cannot surely complain that he forgot\r\nthem, for they appear to haunt his guilty imagination through the whole\r\nof his progress; nor can he complain of wanting room. But the answer is\r\neasy. He knew it would make his bait so very bad that even his own\r\ngulls would not nibble.--\r\n\r\nHe was afraid of injuring his credit as an author even among his _own\r\nsort_--for these affidavits prove conclusively and indubitably, that\r\nnot one jot nor tittle more was uttered against Mr. Young, than what\r\nemanated from his own colleagues, in the course of the winter of 1814\r\nand 1815.\r\n\r\nIt is still more remarkable so far forth as the charge of fraud is\r\nconcerned, with what logical precision _the Citizen_ pursues his\r\ninquiry.--One is naturally led to expect from his _positive rant_,\r\nnothing short of _point blank demonstration_ at least, that the fraud,\r\n(which if there was any originated with Mr. Young's colleagues) had\r\nproduced the desired effect. That the attempt to cheat the people out\r\nof this _mammoth legislator_,--this _sine qua non_ to their political\r\nsalvation, should have at least produced some influence with the men\r\nupon whom it was exerted. Is there no _lost and wandering sheep_ ready\r\nto return to the fold, and certify the delusions practised upon him by\r\nthese wolves in sheeps clothing? Even Mr. Thompson, whose attention is\r\napt to be otherwise directed, the moment he falls in conversation with\r\nPalmer and Bunce, scents out the fraud with all the instinctive\r\nkeenness of a blood hound--Mr. Kasson on the same track, hardly the\r\nlength of a nose behind, and unwilling to be outdone in sagacity,\r\nechoes the howlings of his leader. Judge Stillwell, tho' it seems the\r\ndullest of the pack, follows hard and completes the choir; or in other\r\nwords Thompson and Kasson make a certificate that they _were not\r\ndeceived_, and Stillwell _endorses_ to give it a proper currency.\r\n\r\nEven Mr. Roe lays claim to the same spirit of discernment, tho' his\r\ntitle to that claim might be questionable on another _ground_. He is\r\nreadily led into a conclusion that Mr. Wilkins must have visited the\r\nNorthern towns to procure Mr. Cowen's nomination; when it happens that\r\nthe committees in those towns had been chosen before his name had been\r\nmentioned in them as a candidate, and before he had consented to be\r\nconsidered one. Mr. Roe had much better have satisfied himself by\r\nconsulting the northern delegation on this subject. He is remarkably\r\n_alert_ to detect a _fraud_ where there is none, but is willing to take\r\nany thing upon _tick_ which accommodates his good friend the _Citizen_.\r\nHe certifies that he could not be deceived by the poor stories of\r\nPalmer and Bunce;--But believing the public to be greater numbsculls\r\nthan himself, imagines that he can trick them into a belief, that the\r\ngentlemen who composed the northern delegation (among whom are many of\r\nthe most respectable names in the county) are the mere creatures of\r\nanother's will. It is perhaps fortunate that this man is an exception\r\nto the general law of nature, that _like_ produces _like_, or he might\r\nhave made _tools_ of the whole county convention.\r\n\r\nWho then was defrauded?--The Molts are by no means willing to admit\r\nthat this was the case with them. The Citizen cannot produce even one\r\npoor certificate from any _one_ of the _county convention_, that they\r\nwere deceived or misled--neither Mr. Deake nor judge Child were of the\r\ncommittee, and if they had been, they are both so good as to tell us\r\nthey were not gulled in that instance _at least_. John R. Mott, one of\r\nthe delegation from the town of Saratoga, according to his own\r\ncertificate had gone to New-York and sent Mr Olmstead who, with Mr.\r\n_Cowen's consent_ (for it must have been by his consent that he acted\r\nas a substitute) sat in convention, and voted for Mr. Young. Thus\r\ningeniously does the citizen rummage the chain of cause and effect, to\r\neke out his favorite conclusion.\r\n\r\nBut stop, I confess I had like to have forgotten the certificate of Dr.\r\nChild (Increase W. Child) a son of judge Child, one of the most\r\ndistinguished among the _dramatis personĂ¦_ who figure in the book!--He\r\ndoes go the length of saying, that he voted on the strength of Mr.\r\nBunce's representation. Voted for whom? For Mr. Cowen? O no.--But he\r\nvoted for a _committee_, who were to meet a _committee_, to make out\r\nthe _county nomination_!--And shocking to relate, poor Dr. Child was\r\ngalled into a vote for three of the most respectable men in the town of\r\nMilton!!--viz: Daniel Couch jun. Esq. Joel Keeler Esq. late a member of\r\nthe legislature, and Thomas Palmer Esq!!!--It is derogatory to no man\r\nin that town, to say that a more respectable delegation could not have\r\nbeen procured. And what is more shameful still, one of those gentlemen,\r\nviz: Daniel Couch jun Esq. whom the Doctor had thus honestly sent _to\r\nvote for Mr. Cowen_, actually deceived his constituent, and _voted for\r\nMr. Young_!!!!--Doctor Guild's certificate is very happily illustrated\r\nby the burlesque syllogism; _that Moses was the meekest man:--Solomon\r\nwas the wisest man;--And therefore St. Paul was ship wrecked_. The\r\nconclusion of a fraudulent nomination, follows about as direct upon Dr.\r\nChild's premises, as the shipwreck of St. Paul did upon the meekness of\r\nMoses or the wisdom of Solomon. We should be almost led to suspect from\r\nthis specimen, that the Doctor is a greater _infant in politics_, than\r\nin _dissection_.\r\n\r\nThis famous pamphleteer is by no means more fortunate, when he\r\napproaches the topic of the McBain meeting. The materials of which this\r\nmeeting was composed are now known as far as the book, which has kindly\r\ngiven their names to the public. It consisted of one _first judge_. One\r\n_Sheriff_ and one _Clerk_, appointed under the administration of\r\n_Samuel Young_ Esq.--_George Palmer_ Esq. Master in Chancery, As't.\r\nJustice, Justice of the peace, Post Master, &c, and whom _the book_\r\nholds out as the _expectant_ of the _Surrogates office_--_Roe_ deputy\r\nSheriff and _ci-devant_ constable--_James Mutt_--_James Thompson_ Esq.\r\nwho had kindly volunteered, as early as the 1st of April, to take the\r\ninterests of the county under his charge as _public prosecutor_ and\r\n_States evidence_--_Alpheus Goodrich Esq. his partner_--Doctor _Nathan\r\nThompson_ his brother--Mr _Elias Benedict_ his client;--the one willing\r\nto _receive_, and the other to _pay_ in certificates of the most\r\ncurrent stamp--_A justice or justices_ from Ballston, who knew their\r\npolitical God-father--Dr. _Samuel Pitkin_, who acted as minister\r\nplenipotentiary from _Milton_ to _Saratoga_, making thirteen, who it is\r\nadmitted, were from all the different towns enumerated in the caption\r\nof the meeting viz: Ballston, Stillwater, Galway, Saratoga, Greenfield\r\nand Milton. Add to these some others of minor note, and you make, as\r\nthe Citizen would have it, the number of 21 _or more_. The Citizen too\r\ntells us he was there; but whether in the character of ---- ---- or\r\n---- we are left to grope in the gloom of conjecture.\r\n\r\nSuch was the formidable _Areopagus_ convened to purify the _body\r\npolitic_; to correct the poor misguided county convention;--and guard\r\nthe people against _being their own worst enemies_; such was the\r\nassembly presented to the public as a _numerous and respectable_\r\nmeeting from 6 towns out of 14 (judge Child and Dr. Thompson kindly\r\nrepresenting the towns of _Greenfield_ and _Galway_.)\r\n\r\nNo sooner had this _numerous meeting_ assembled, than it was tho't\r\nnecessary to divide them into the proper committees;--This being more\r\n_genteel_ and _parliamentary_ than to act in a body;--Accordingly\r\n_Stillwell, Thompson and Palmer_ were created a committee to draw up\r\nthe proceedings of the meeting; _Child_ and _Stillwell_, a committee of\r\n_Logic_ and _Rhetoric_, to call on _absent friends_ and get them to\r\nconsent that he _should resign. Mott_ and _Child acted_ as a _committee\r\nof vigilance_ to pick up and report scraps of conversations and letters\r\nfrom Mr. Gowen after the meeting was over. _Mott, Thompson, Kasson,\r\nStillwell, Roe,_ &c acted as a committee to report to the county, the\r\nfraud which had deprived _Mr Young_ of his undoubted right to go to the\r\nLegislature, whether the people were _willing_ or _not_. Mr. Elias\r\nBenedict to draw up the proceedings of _Mr. Wilkins_ and _possibly_ to\r\nenforce the statute for the suppression of Vice and Immorality;--and\r\ncommittee of the whole to tell the county they had been there; and do\r\naway the strange reports which had gone abroad, that they were a little\r\nself-created body, without _precedent, authority or premises_,\r\nresembling what saucy people would call a _faction_.\r\n\r\nAll might yet have gone well, had not _Stillwell_ been such a miserable\r\n_slouch_ at telling a story. It appears that Stillwell and Palmer had\r\nwritten a history of the meeting for publication, in which _Mr. Cowen_\r\ntells the meeting, \"that _they_ must be responsible if they act without\r\nhis absolute resignation.\" See p. 24 and 5. This presumptuous act\r\nthrows the Citizen into a whirlwind of passion; and he falls a _cursing\r\nlike a very drab_, at _Palmer, Bunce and Cowen_, apparently not\r\nbelieving that his _friend Stillwell_ would ever have told so dangerous\r\na _truth_. He calls it a _farrago of nonsense_, after having before\r\nasserted that _Palmer as Secretary_ had nothing to do with it; that it\r\nbelonged exclusively to the _committee of publication;_ and _then_\r\nrecollecting that Palmer and Stillwell were a majority of that\r\n_committee_, and consequently the _proper authority_, he takes another\r\nleap, and says, that the _rough draft_ of the _proceedings_ were given\r\nto _James Thompson Esq_ for wham he claims the _copy right_.\r\n\r\nNow altho' _Thompson_ is unwilling to be outdone in telling a story,\r\nand tho' he had peaceable and quiet possession according to _the book_\r\nof the _consciences_ of _Stillwell and Child_, instead of telling the\r\npublic that _Mr. Cowen had resigned_, he says something which to be\r\nsure would look \"_like that_,\" _as the citizen says_, upon the first\r\nimpression; but which on being critically examined, contradicts the\r\nfact on the face of it. Even the compound of jargon and inconsistency\r\ndrawn up by Thompson, and published in page 16 of the book, could not\r\nbe tortured into an _unconditional resignation_. Mr. Cowen is there\r\nmade to say, not that he _resigned_ nomination;--But that for reasons\r\nthere enumerated, \"it was his _personal wish to resign his own\r\nnomination_ &c. and he submitted to the decision of the meeting, the\r\nquestion whether it would be most expedient to act on his _resignation\r\nwhich_ he now made (_which_ must refer to the _personal wish_ before\r\nexpressed, for no other resignation is pretended) if the meeting should\r\njudge a postponement impracticable, or to postpone acting until he\r\ncould have time to communicate to some of the particular friends of his\r\nnomination (beside those who were present at the meeting) his reasons\r\nfor resigning, and procure their concurrence _before hand_ &c.\"\r\n\r\nMr Cowen thus makes the concurrence of his friends _before hand_ a\r\n_condition precedent_;--but the meeting disregard it--reject the\r\ncondition, and gravely resolve to accept _a resignation_, which had not\r\nyet been tendered to them. Such is the rickety production which came\r\nstraggling before the public in search of the Secretary, who had\r\nrefused it the sanction of his name. In order to remedy this evil, and\r\n\"_throw it into form_\" as the citizen would say, _his_ name gives place\r\nto that of _Thompson and Stillwell_, who it is agreed are _larger_ men\r\nthan the Secretary,[10] and must therefore carry greater weight. Even\r\nthe certificate which follows, signed by nearly the whole of the\r\nmeeting, after going on to say that Mr. Cowen openly and publicly\r\nresigned, immediately defeats itself by referring back to, and adopting\r\nthe statement drawn up by Thompson as a _candid, fair and faithful\r\nstatement of facts_;--and it is evident that such part of the\r\ncertificate as overshoots the premises upon which it is professedly\r\nfounded, must mean nothing more than to give a _construction_ advocated\r\nby the Citizen, and which they esteem so necessary for their defence.\r\nThe certificate of Peters, Stewart and How, shew the miserable shifts\r\nto which the Citizen and his friends were driven in order to bear\r\nthemselves out in their conduct. They are perhaps excusable so long as\r\nthey keep to the question of _construction_; but when they tax the zeal\r\nof their friends with certificates and declarations so far beyond what\r\nthey themselves are willing to say--nay, which actually _contradict_\r\nthe certificates and declarations that precede them, one is almost\r\ninduced to overlook the difficulties of their defence, and to suspect\r\nthe moral honesty--not of these men; but of those who have drawn them\r\ninto this singular situation.\r\n\r\nAfter all this round of certifying and reasoning, the shoe still\r\ncontinues to pinch, and the first Judge again appears before the public\r\nto help the defect. Altho' he signed Thompson's statement in which he\r\nis careful to make use of the language employed by it, and the epithet\r\n_personal_ when he speaks of Mr. Cowen's language, yet when he\r\nafterwards hears of a distinction between _personally_ and _absolutely_\r\nhe seems almost struck dumb with astonishment, and says he had never\r\nheard of the distinction before. Now altho' the public will make all\r\nrational allowance for the judge's want of distinction where Mr.\r\nThompson is concerned, yet I suspect they could hardly account for his\r\npresent lack of apprehension, unless he took that statement upon tick,\r\nand signed without reading it.\r\n\r\nStill despairing of any thing like a defence upon this ground, the\r\nCitizen at length, p. 24, dismisses his whole train of statements,\r\ncertificates and letters, & undertakes very learnedly and elaborately\r\nto refine upon the distinction; and insists that if a man expresses his\r\n_personal wish to resign_, it is to all intents and purposes a\r\n_resignation_, and that no other was ever heard of; as if it was\r\nimpossible to consult the opinions of others, and make a _general\r\nresignation_ depend upon their consent. All that it seems necessary in\r\nthat case, is for the McBain meeting to resolve to accept what they\r\nthus are pleased to call a resignation, and nominate another candidate.\r\nAnd this it seems accords with the sense of all the world on the\r\nsubject, both federal and republican. Thus the world are at length\r\nafter a lapse of ages, furnished with an easy recipe for a\r\nresignation--a sort of _panacea_ to correct all the sores of the body\r\npolitic and produce a \"_speedy composure of the public mind\" \"Tereatis\r\nRisum Amici_;\" and call no one a political quack playing off his\r\nwhimsical nostrums upon the people, whose mental repose lies so near\r\nhis heart. If the meeting are told that they _shall be responsible if\r\nthey act on a declaration thus limited_, keep it out of view as much as\r\npossible, or say as the citizen does, p. 40, that it was only something\r\n_like that_ or _out of season_, or some such thing. If a committee of\r\n_three_ are chosen to publish the proceedings and _two_ of them write a\r\n_farrago of nonsense_ which puts the whole together by the ears, in\r\norder to decide the quarrel and \"_speedily compose the public mind_,\"\r\nlet them raffle upon the question, and to see that every thing is fair,\r\nappoint the _First Judge_ to hold the hat. Ancient history tells us of\r\nmore important controversies than this, decided in the same way;\r\n\r\n  Old Hector was a wary chap,\r\n  At pitch and chuck and hustle-cap,\r\n  An old Scotch bonnet quickly takes,\r\n  In which he three brass farthings shakes;\r\n  Then turn'd his head without deceit,\r\n\r\n  To shew them that he scorn'd to cheat;\r\n  And cries aloud, here goes, my boy,\r\n  'Tis _heads_ for Greece and _tails_ for Troy;\r\n  Then turns the cap: _great Troy_ prevails,\r\n  _Two farthings_ out of three were tails.\r\n\r\nBut it is time to lift the curtain, and attend more minutely to the\r\n_chief jugglers_ who figure behind it. _The Sheriff and others_, who\r\nsign the McBain certificate, alledge that Mr. Cowen (_according to\r\ntheir construction_) not only _resigned his nomination_ but _did so_\r\nwithout any previous _request (as they perceived)_ It would seem from\r\n_this_, that these men were kept as a sort of _puppets_ to dance in\r\naccordance with the wires which actuated them, from behind the scene;\r\nbeing thus, _according to their own account_, strangers to the\r\n_pressing request_ made to Mr. Cowen, and the _arguments_ by which it\r\nwas enforced. They are excluded the main _performance_ and reserved for\r\nthe _farce_--probably for the _wisest_ of reasons, as there are certain\r\nimportant parts which would be ruined in _vulgar hands_. It is time\r\nthat these men _should perceive_, if they have _not yet learned_ one\r\nimportant fact among others, which their famous masters, _Thompson and\r\nChild_, have thus hypocritically concealed throughout. For this purpose\r\nI give the following extract of a _letter_ from Judge Child, written on\r\nthe subject of that _meeting_, the day after it took place, dated at\r\nGreenfield, April 19, 1815:\r\n\r\n     \"We accordingly met, and had a free candid and friendly\r\n     _consultation_ with _Mr. Cowen_; and when he came to hear the\r\n     _communication from Esquire Cowles, Ketchum and Gardner_, on\r\n     the subject of Mr. Young's _conduct_ and _usefulness_ in the\r\n     Legislature;--_and taking into consideration all the\r\n     circumstances_, he cheerfully declared that, _in his\r\n     judgement_, it was best for him to resign being a candidate;\r\n     and use his influence for the election of Mr. Young;--but\r\n     that he _really desired_ an opportunity of _consulting those\r\n     friends_ who had exerted themselves to procure his\r\n     nomination, that were not present. It was stated to him that\r\n     they lived or at least _some_ of them, at such a distance,\r\n     that it would be very difficult to give seasonable\r\n     information to the county of his _resignation_ in favor of Mr\r\n     Young, should it be put bye till Thursday or Friday as he\r\n     requested;--and that the same _reasons_[11] _which convinced\r\n     him that it would be proper for him to resign, would satisfy\r\n     them on the subject_. Mr. Cowen _still_ tho't it would be\r\n     _the best way to proceed_ and the most gratifying to his\r\n     feelings, _to take time to consult his friends_.\"\r\n\r\nThus you see Mr. Cowen was requested to resign, and the _arguments_ in\r\nfavor of that resignation founded upon the _famous certificate_, dated\r\nAlbany, April 17, 1815, published Ante, page 4--a statement\r\n_jesuitically_ calculated to shew that the zeal of his friends had, _by\r\nperverting the conversation of Ketchum &c._ aided in procuring _his_\r\nnomination. And when he expresses a _desire_ to consult his friends;\r\n_an answer_ is ready, emanating from the same false and deceptive\r\nsource. Thus are the most _shameful arts_ employed to destroy his\r\n_confidence in those friends_, and induce in him a reluctance _under\r\nall the circumstances_ (as the first judge expresses it) against being\r\na candidate--You thus see their _rotten certificate_ made the\r\nfoundation for the _rise_--_progress_ and _result_ of that _meeting_.\r\nThus does the charge of DUPLICITY, FRAUD and FALSEHOOD recoil upon the\r\nheads of those _arch-certifiers_, or _the men_ employed in _obtaining_\r\nand _giving currency_ to their shameful communication.\r\n\r\nIt then in fact ceases to be a question what was _said_ or _done_ by\r\nthat meeting, or any member of it. For according to every principle of\r\nreasoning, _divine_ or _human_; if the _whole_ was grounded on _fraud_,\r\nthe whole was a _nullity_, and possessed no _moral force_. \"If\" says\r\nthe book, \"Mr. Cowen's _nomination_ was procured _by fraud_, it cannot\r\nbe called a _nomination_; and may be departed from with impunity.\" It\r\nturning out on investigation, that his _nomination_ was a _perfectly\r\nfair one_, and his pretended _resignation_ founded on the _grossest\r\nduplicity_;--whether it was _conditional_ or _absolute_, whether it was\r\n_personal_ or _general_, it is void, and unworthy the name of a\r\n_resignation_. _Eternal justice_ disavows it; _Political justice_\r\ndisowns it; and _common sense_ condemns the perversion. The\r\n_nomination_ of _Mr. Young_, by a meeting thus _packed_ for the\r\npurpose, by a few of _his friends_, was not only _void_ for that\r\nreason, but it had its origin in the _same duplicity_, and was\r\ntherefore equally void with _every thing founded upon it_.\r\n\r\nWere Young's colleagues correctly informed, as to the manner _their\r\nconversations_ were spoken of? or were they deceived by _Kasson_ and\r\n_Thompson_ when they called for their _certificates_ at Albany? If the\r\n_latter_, they had near one year before giving their _second_\r\ncertificate, to correct the error. Why have they always shrunk from\r\ninvestigation? Why in their _second_ certificate, contradict the\r\n_first_? Why after having _near a year_ to _prepare_ it, does their\r\n_second_ certificate _contradict itself_? As they now stand, they\r\npresent a more shocking _caricature_ of folly and inconsistency, than\r\never _figured_ before the public. They have burst the bands of\r\npolitical faith--They have melted the cement of affection, and driven\r\nto a returnless distance, the best and dearest of friends. No man knew\r\nwhat to say or think of what they said or certified--Individual ruin is\r\nthreatened, and the destruction of a _free press_ aimed at; while in\r\nthe political atmosphere all is uproar, disorder and confusion.\r\n\r\n  --Alas.--\"That _men_,\r\n  Clothed with a little _brief authority_,\r\n  Should play such antic tricks before high heaven,\r\n  As make the angels weep!\"\r\n\r\nWith these men however I have now done--But let their _Pander_ beware;\r\nlet him _pause and reflect_, ere it be too late--\"Already are the\r\nsluices of public indignation opened upon him--Already is he _drifted\r\nalong on the surface of the stream, the object of_ CONTAGION and\r\nABOMINATION\"--AN ELECTOR. MAY 1816.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNOTE: The public will duly _appreciate_ the reasons for _postponing_\r\nthe publication of the foregoing till _after Election_. The writer\r\nhopes he has avoided the example of the _Citizen_, by not _descending_\r\nto the retreats of _private_ character.--Even the author of the book\r\nhas not been named. The character given of that author, ante page 30 in\r\nnote, is not intended to apply to any one named in that\r\npamphlet.--Indeed I hope for the honor of human nature, that however\r\n_strange_ and _inconsistently_ some of these men have acted who have in\r\nthat production given their names to the public, yet that none of them\r\nare so far gone as to prostitute themselves to the vile purpose of\r\nwriting such a work as that in which their names are interlarded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n[1]  _Several hundred of these certificates were a day or two after the\r\nMcBain Meeting, struck off at the FEDERAL Printing' Office in this\r\nVillage, and circulated thro' the County during the election_.\r\n\r\n[2] _It will be recollected that the writer of this letter is the\r\nfamous conversation-monger, who together with his brother James Mott,\r\nare made the instruments of proving duplicity in Mr. Cowen. John R.\r\nMott pretends that as early as the 1st of March, Mr. Cowen told him\r\nthat Palmer and Bunce were opposed to Young, &c and yet on the 6th day\r\nof_ April _following, he very gravely informs Mr. Cowen by letter, of\r\nthe very facts which he says Mr. Cowen had told him before. This is the\r\nman too who tells so much about_ private _conversation, and Mr.\r\nCowen's_ hesitating _to tell him names; and enjoining him to_ secresy,\r\n_and who so very spunkily says that he called Gen. Dunning \"a fool.\"\r\nMr. Cowen must, I think, feel himself greatly indebted to these_\r\nbrother _certifiers for their honor and patriotism. This too is the\r\nman, who sometime before wrote a fawning letter, asking Mr. Cowen to\r\ngive him an office (Assistant Assessor of the U.S.) which he had at his\r\ndisposal; to which Mr. Cowen readily acceded, and afterwards on another\r\nwritten request, conferred the same office on his_ brother certifier\r\n_James Mott. [The inhabitants of Halfmoon, will furnish ample\r\ncredentials, for their extraordinary_ attention _and_ correctness _in\r\nthe execution of their offices, One of these men shortly before the\r\nelection was appointed deputy to the Sheriff: He suddenly veers about\r\nand becomes a convert to_ court _doctrine, and evinces his zeal in the\r\nnew cause he had espoused, by his_ anathemas _against his former\r\nfriends.] These brothers in blood, in politics and in virtue,\r\ngenerously avail themselves of the advantages afforded them by official\r\nintercourse with Mr. Cowen on business, and then patriotically tender\r\nthe fruits of their_ rotten-hearted _labor to_ \"the citizen\" _and his\r\nfriends as proofs of duplicity_.\r\n\r\n[3] _This was on the_ first _day of the Polls--but it seems by Mr.\r\nBennet's certificate, that as soon as the election was over, Thompson\r\nflung off the mask, and exhibited his_ cloven foot _without reserve_.\r\n\r\n[4] _Altho' it is a fact well known that this meeting was projected by,\r\nand the canting pretences which bro't it together and sent forth the\r\nstrange account which it gives of itself, originated with_ two or three\r\n\"demagogues,\" _yet it is a subject of real regret that a_ few honest\r\nmen _have suffered themselves to be duped by their shameful artifices.\r\nIt commenced with_ Mr. Thompson of Milton, _who during the summer past\r\nhas been very industrious in serving up and peddling little doses of\r\nslander against_ Mr. Baldwin, Mr. Bunce, and others. _This man has been\r\na real political_ scold, _ever since he found himself capable of\r\nthrowing a little confusion into the ranks of the county; He is the\r\nfirst_ male Xantippe _who has reduced the doctrine of scolding to a\r\nsystem, and certified it in a_ book. _Of such characters there is\r\nlittle hopes:_\r\n\r\n  \"_Destroy his_ web and sophistry _in vain_,\r\n  _The creature's at his_ dirty work _again_.\"\r\n\r\n[5] _Altho' no man more sincerely rejoices in the charitable donations\r\nof the people of Saratoga, for the relief of our brethren at_ Sacket's\r\nHarbor, _than the writer of these remarks, yet he cannot avoid joining\r\nin the general disgust at the vanity of Judge Child, in trying to\r\nelicit public applause for himself. The judge cannot bear to hide his\r\ncharming light under a bushel. Instead of not suffering one hand to\r\nknow what the other is doing, he is not content with its being\r\npublished in a_ book, _but advertises his charity in a newspaper as a\r\nman would one of his_ stray cattle. _From his liberal conduct to the\r\nEditor of the Journal and others, he is perhaps excusable in calling\r\nhis charity about him as soon as possible, even if he offers a\r\nconsiderable reward for it in the next advertisement which he puts into\r\nhis darling paper_.\r\n\r\n[6] By a new species of logic adopted by the author of the Book, a man\r\nis accounted _honorable_ and _virtuous_ by the square foot of carcase.\r\nErgo, \"a little man\" in stature, comprehends all that is _hypocritical_\r\nand _wicked_. The _great man_, James Merrill, who is the subject of\r\nthis note, by the above rule is of course, the most _honorable_, best\r\ninformed and _religious_ man of the whole group, who embellish the fair\r\npages of that \"book.\" It is proper that the public should know a little\r\nof his _debut_ and _denoument_ as a political character.\r\n\r\nHis _first_ notorious feat was performed in his first and last\r\nappearance as a member of assembly, where his colleague by a friendly\r\nrap on the knuckle convinced him that he was _endeavoring_ to read off\r\na _federal_ vote for a council of appointment, which a federal member\r\nhad assured him was more _legible_ than the one _prepared_ for him.\r\n\r\nThe _second_ time as a quid of the _Burr_ stamp, and willing to spend\r\n500 dollars rather than the republican candidate should succeed.\r\n\r\nThe _third_ time in a _new_ character; with his name blazoned in large\r\ncapitals in recommendation of S. Van Rensselaer for governor, in\r\nopposition to Daniel D. Tompkins in 1813.\r\n\r\nThe fourth time in 1815, as the _sub_ agent and director of the McBain\r\nmeeting; still ready with 100 dollars, to divide the ticket with the\r\nfederalists rather than the regular nomination should succeed and Mr.\r\nYoung not be elected; swearing he had not _before taken hold since his\r\nfriend Burr went down_.\r\n\r\nOn the _first_ day of election he is a flaming democrat.\r\n\r\nOn the _second_ day, at the opening of the polls, he makes public\r\nproclamation \"for all those who did not intend to vote for Mr Young to\r\ncome forward and state their reasons, _and they should be heard_; and\r\nthat _now_ he had no objections that _three federalists_ should be\r\nelected.\"\r\n\r\nOn the third day of the election, \"_it depended on a word, and the\r\ntypes of the republican printer would be scattered_.\" A true sample of\r\n\"the mild spirit of Christian humility\" Vid. _book_.\r\n\r\n[7] _This circumstance would not have been mentioned had not the\r\n_CITIZEN_ boasted of the same office confering great honor on one of\r\nhis disciples_.\r\n\r\n[8] In treating of the productions of an author, it is customary to\r\ngive some account of his character, pursuits, &c. &c. This is usually\r\ndone by way of _introduction_ or _appendix_. I beg leave in this\r\ninstance to deviate from the regular method, and present him in the\r\nmore appropriate station of a _Nota Bene_.\r\n\r\nThe author of that pamphlet is a _lawyer_ in _practice_ and a\r\n_moralist_ by _profession_; by the former, he has acquired great\r\n_booty_; by the latter a ---- and what is peculiar to himself (and all\r\n'peculiar' men have their peculiarities) he never suffers his\r\n_profession_ to interfere with his _practice_; and yet in _money\r\nconcerns_, he has been known to handle _both_, with great _adroitness_.\r\nIn his _practice_ his fellow townsmen are \"pine plains men,\" in his\r\nprofession \"a contemptible rabble;\" and truly so, for the former tell\r\nhim \"the farm you live on was once the soil of a revolutionary\r\nsoldier.\" This is truly saucey, for he acquired it by his _practice_.\r\nThe latter tell him, \"you sued us for small sums due the estate of a\r\nrelative; you made us ten times more costs than the demands--you took\r\nadvantage of a then existing law, to oppress us; you feasted on our\r\nmisfortunes, and rioted on our distresses; till an _ugly_ law extended\r\nrelief to the '_rabble_'.\"\r\n\r\nOne of these men living in an adjoining town, tells him, \"I once owned\r\ntwo farms; I own no farms now--They are swallowed up in '_morality_.'\"\r\nIt is not yet ascertained, whether his rate of 40 per cent interest, is\r\nregulated by his _practice_ or his _profession_. It certainly cannot\r\nbe, as has been supposed, in proportion to the wants of the distressed.\r\nI am inclined to think his _morality_ often runs ahead of his\r\n_practice_, in this case.\r\n\r\nA _good reputation_ is not common to all men. Our author has\r\npractically demonstrated the truth of this position, and conclusively\r\nshewn, that the _needy_ have an absolute right to filch a supply from\r\ntheir neighbor; and has exhibited such powerful proofs in support of\r\n_his_ claims, that he has actually obtained more than a _quantum\r\nsufficit_, and conferred the surplus on some of his _needy_ friends.\r\n\r\nThe misfortunes of his neighbor, forms the chief round in his _ladder_\r\nto eminence; it rests on the sanctuary of domestic afflictions, and is\r\nsupported by the tears of the widow and the orphan. Lo! Avarice claims\r\nhim for her own--Billingsgate yields her choicest flowers--Envy\r\nentwines the glowing wreath--and malice triumphantly crowns him \"lord\r\nof the ascendant.\"\r\n\r\n[9] _The certificates of these men interlard several points of\r\nconversation as minute as the souls which gave operation to their\r\nmemory; and which appear to be designed to answer no other purpose,\r\nthan to shew the extraordinary strength and accuracy of intellect by\r\nwhich they are characterized. Their fixed attention to such matters may\r\nserve as some excuse for the manner in which they executed their\r\noffices of U.S. assessors. But I have had occasion to note these\r\ngentlemen once before_.\r\n\r\n[10] _The Citizen is perhaps correct when he calls Mr. Palmer a_ little\r\nman, _and Judges of his own_ favorites _by the quantity of_ matter\r\n_instead of_ mind;--_Like the Italian Farmer in estimating the\r\nqualities of a_ grave animal _no less famous for_ strength and dullness\r\n_than for the_ length _of his_ ears.\r\n\r\n[11] _It seems that an effort was afterwards made to convince their\r\nfriends, by publishing several hundreds of the famous communication\r\nfrom Young's colleagues, notwithstanding an express stipulation to the\r\ncontrary_.",
